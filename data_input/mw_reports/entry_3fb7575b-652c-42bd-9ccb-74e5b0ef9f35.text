American Rescue Plan Act Lures in the Wild

Executive Summary
DomainTools researchers discovered a cluster of credential harvesting sites masquerading
as American Rescue Plan Act signup sites for those looking to receive their federal aid.
Through historical WHOIS information and OSINT techniques DomainTools attributed this
campaign to a Nigerian web development firm GoldenWaves Innovations. In this article,
DomainTools researchers will walk through the techniques and methods used to enumerate
these websites and associated attribution with medium-high confidence.

Background
On March 11, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law.
The COVID-19 pandemic relief bill was designed to provide $1,400 in immediate relief to
working families, emergency paid leave for over 100 million Americans, and expand the
child tax credit among a number of other grants and pillars to assist with other budget
shortfalls. Since this act was signed into law, DomainTools researchers have monitored for
new registrations of domains that targeted relief recipients. Unfortunately, many relief
recipients are unaware that this relief will be automatically assigned to them by the IRS, so
scammers are using this as an opportunity to collect social security numbers and driver’s
license photographs to use in identity theft.

Hunting for More

2/13

The initial domain found by DomainTools researchers was reliefcarefunds[.]com that
contained the above application form with a typical upload to a PHP destination on the
same domain. However, buried in the code was a comment that the page had been
mirrored from americaforgivenrelieffund[.]com and a contact page that submitted to a PHP
script on that domain as well. With evidence of more domains, DomainTools researchers
took a look at the architecture behind the pages for similarities. As readers of this blog will
know, DomainTools is a strong proponent of the composite objects method for building out
indicators and through examining these two pages we could see that what they had in
common was:
Registration through NameCheap
Containing the “relief” substring
Containing the “eric” as in America substring or the “care” substringRegistration after
the signing of the bill into law on March 11, 2021
Hosting on NameCheap hosting infrastructure

3/13

Hunting for this composite in DomainTools Iris Investigate, DomainTools researchers
revealed 39 potential domains and an email address associated with a number of them of
goldenwaves247@gmail[.]com. To confirm similarities, we used URLScan to search for the
list of domains uncovered for any scans done by others that had encountered these
domains over the last month. Unsurprisingly, this revealed an additional set of domains with
identical structure to the initial phishing page dating back almost exactly a month.

4/13

This list of domains then provided another set of important information. For one,
DomainTools researchers were able to see that some of these links were being pushed by
Bitly link shortening links. With Bitly, appending a “+” to any shortened link provides some
data about that link. In this instance, we could see that the shortener was created at 1630
UTC time on June 5th, 2021 with a specific title of “Unemployment Insurance Relief During
COVID-19 Outbreak | American Rescue Plan Act” which matches the titles of the other
cloned pages.

5/13

We can also tell that many of the cloned pages, at the time of their scanning, were not
hosted solely on NameCheap’s site hosting services, but were also active on both
Garanntor (AS328110) and OVH (AS16276). This allowed the set of items we search for to:
Registration through NameCheap
Containing the “relief” substring
Containing the “eric” as in America substring or the “care” substring
Registration after the signing of the bill into law on March 11, 2021
Hosting on NameCheap (AS22612), Garanntor (AS328110), or OVH (AS16276)
hosting infrastructure
This then revealed a total of 47 domains matching our criteria including the oldest domain
on URLScan page similarities and the oldest domain in our search criteria
theamericaforgivenrelief[.]com with a registrant email address of onostboy1@gmail[.]com
and an unredacted WHOIS record placing the registrant in Ibadan, Nigeria. Searching on
that username then reveals a profile on social media site Eskimi of a web developer with an
associated Twitter handle of @onostboy with the name Tosyno based in Ibadan, Nigeria.
The city of Ibadan is a small, rural town which makes the registration information stand out
as almost always technical contacts for Nigerian domains are located in Lagos, the capital
city and technology center. Additional searches reveal the same username participating in
sales on cybercrime forums, Steam gaming, and other social media sites.

Pivoting on the previous address of goldenwaves247@gmail[.]com that was surfaced
reveals a number of domains including Dasani, Fiji, and Mountain Dew brand sites that
looks to be recruiting for various promotional programs in exchange for money, a fake UK
bank site at natwestukbank[.]com, and finally a site with the domain goldenwavesng[.]com
that contained the email in historical WHOIS records before going private in late 2018. This
is the site of GoldenWaves Innovations, a technology company based in Ibadan, Nigeria
which DomainTools researchers assume with medium confidence to be the legitimate web
design firm in front of the identity document harvesting sites.

7/13

Reading the information on GoldenWaves Innovations’ page we can see that they claim to
be registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) of the government of Nigeria.
Searching for that company name on ng-check[.]com, a site for querying CAC information,
we can see that GoldenWaves Innovation indeed has a valid registration along with the
name of the company’s CEO which matches the WHOIS details and who claims to be the
company’s CEO on LinkedIn. Though the company was registered in February of 2016,
their registration is currently inactive.

Additionally, the historical WHOIS record unearths an address in New York, New York of
120 E 87th Street. This is an apartment building with condos ranging from $900,000 to
$13,000,000 in the heart of Manhattan. While at first that seems strange for a company
based in Nigeria, we can see from LinkedIn that one of the company’s developers claims to
live in New York City.

Looking at the CEO’s current contact information on LinkedIn we can see that
GoldenWaves Innovations has a new website in goldenwaves[.]com[.]ng which is also tied
to the same email address and registration information. This gives DomainTools
researchers high confidence that all of these credential harvesting sites are linked to
GoldenWaves Innovations in Nigeria. These sites along with any new ones that have
cropped up were reported to Google Safe Browsing for blocking.

Takeaways
Credential harvesting campaigns continue to be a fruitful way for attackers to gain legitimate
legal documents they can then resell or use for more sophisticated behavior. When looking
for federal aid, those in need the most may not always be fully aware of how that aid is
being distributed. In the case of the American Rescue Plan Act that money was coming
directly from the IRS, but nonetheless unsuspecting victims could be led into uploading their
identification documents to one of these sites.
10/13

DomainTools researchers would recommend that security teams utilize internal passive
DNS monitoring to alert them of new domains aged less than 90 days that are responding
with IP addresses on cloud provider ASNs. That is the most efficient way to discover these
domains on your own network. As for end users, DomainTools recommends:
Reporting the site to Google Safe Browsing if you come across one so that it will be
blocked as soon as possible on all major browsers.
Reporting the malicious site up to your security team along with the phishing email
that came with it as there may be a campaign targeting your employees.
Never upload your documents to a website you are not logged into and particularly not
a site claiming to be a federal one without a .gov domain name.
