Abstract
Formbook [1] is an infostealer that has been advertised for sale in public hacking forums
since February 2016 by a user with the handle 'ng-Coder'. It is more advanced than a
keylogger as it can retrieve authorization and login credentials from a web data form before
the information reaches a secure server, bypassing HTTPS encryption. Formbook is
effective even if the victims use a virtual keyboard, auto-fill, or if they copy and paste
information to fill the form. The author of Formbook affirms that it is 'browser-logger
software', a.k.a. form-grabbing software. Formbook offers a PHP panel, where the buyers
can track their victims' information, including screenshots, keylogged data, and stolen
credentials. Hosting and domain services are provided for low prices with a bin only
available in the Pro version.

Formbook was used in a spam campaign in late 2017, targeting the aerospace, defence
contractor and manufacturing sectors in South Korea and the USA. It includes hiding,
persistence, anti-analysis, deletion and termination mechanisms along with several
commands that the C&C (command-and-control) server can receive. The 'ng-Coder' user
indicated that Formbook should not be used for malicious purposes and blocked sales until
further notice after the spam campaigns became known. According to 'ng-Coder', Formbook
should only be used to spy on family members or employees if the user has the explicit right
to do so. However, this claim is dubious given the barely legitimate nature of the use of
such software.

About formgrabbers
Formgrabbers intercept HTTP(S) data and use inline hooking to redirect the function to one
within the formgrabber before transferring the execution flow back to the HTTP function to
complete the request. This technique allows formgrabbers to capture a user's information
before the user submits it over the Internet to a secure server. While keyloggers focus
mainly on capturing the user's input, formgrabbers collect pasted information and/or
information selected via a drop-down option, which makes them more efficient than
keyloggers.
A formgrabber injects a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) into a browser and monitors for calls to
the HttpSendRequest API within WININET.DLL in order to intercept the data before
encryption and send all requests to its own code, prior to sending the data onwards.
Andromeda (aka Gamarue), Tinba and Weyland‑Yutani BOT are some malware families
that use this technique.

Formbook background
Prior to advertising it for sale, a user with the handle 'ng-Coder' offered Formbook for free in
public hacking forums so that other users could review it.

Figure 1: First mention of Formbook in a forum.
Soon after the free version was released, the user 'ng-Coder' advertised Formbook for sale
at an initial price of 250 USD. However, the author reduced the price to 120 USD in early
March 2016 after receiving several complaints about the price from forum members. The
current pricing list and payment methods offered in the forum are displayed in Figure 2.

Characteristics
According to the user 'ng-Coder', Formbook boasts the following features:
Coded in ASM/C (x86_x64)
Startup (hidden)
Full PE-injection (no DLL/no drop/both x86 and x64)
Ring3 kit
Bin is Balloon Executable (MPIE + MEE)
Doesn't use suspicious Windows APIs
No blind hook, all hooks are thread safe including the x64, so crash is unlikely
All communications with the panel are encrypted
Install manager
File browsing (FB Connect)
Full Unicode support.

Control panel
Formbook works as a botnet, infecting victims that are shown in a web panel in order to
manage the information that is retrieved from them. Figure 3 shows the web panel.

Each bot can receive the following commands from the C&C server:
Download and execute
Update
Uninstall

Visit URL
Clear cookies
Restart system
Shut down system
Force upload keystroke
Take screenshot
FB Connect (file browsing)
Download and execute from FB Connect
Update bin from FB Connect

Campaigns
Formbook was used in spam campaigns targeting the aerospace, defence contractor and
manufacturing sectors within the US and South Korea in 2017 [2]. It was distributed via
PDFs with embedded links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and compressed
files containing the executable.
It was also observed in 2018, distributed via emails with DOCX files that contained a URL
[3]. This URL downloaded an RTF file that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops an
executable. This executable downloads the Formbook sample.

Analysis
The analysed sample is a RAR self-extracting archive (SFX) that contains several files, as
shown in Figure 4.

5/12

Figure 4: SFX file.
The description to the right of the files shows the following strings:
Path=%LocalAppData%\temp\cne
Silent=1
Update=UcE1U8
Setup=axo.exe pwm-axa

6/12

Files with a size below 1K contain a few strings that are probably used during
decompression.
After executing the SFX file, Formbook extracts the files in %LocalAppData%\temp\cne
using CreateDirectoryW. It then deletes the SFX file. Figure 5 shows the file extraction.

Figure 5: File

extraction.
The axo.exe file is an AutoIt script that is executed with the pwm-axa file as a parameter.
Figure 6 shows the properties of the axo.exe file.

axo.exe AutoIt executable.
The script decrypts Formbook and loads it in memory. In order to do this, it creates a file
with a random name that contains Formbook's functionality and deletes it soon after loading
it in memory. This file contains 44 functions with obfuscated names. The sni.mp3 file
includes interesting strings that were used during the execution, as shown in Figure 7.

The script contains the following features:

1. Hiding mechanism
The script changes the cne folder attributes to hide its content by executing the command
FileSetAttrib($cne_Folder_Path, "+H").

2. Persistence mechanism
In order to remain persistent, it modifies the Run registry key with a new key named
WindowsUpdate that instructs the execution of axo.exe along with pwm-axa:
If IsAdmin() Then
RegWrite("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run",
$WindowsUpdate, "REG_SZ", $cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $axo.exe & " " &
FileGetShortName(FileGetShortName($cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $pwm-axa)))
Else
RegWrite("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run",
$WindowsUpdate, "REG_SZ", $cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $axo.exe & " " &
FileGetShortName($cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $pwm-axa))
RegWrite("HKCU64\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run", $WindowsUpdate,
"REG_SZ", $cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $axo.exe & " " &
FileGetShortName($cne_Folder_Path & "\" & $pwm-axa))
EndIf
Sleep(1000)
Sleep(1000)
EndFunc

Figure 8: Persistence mechanism.

3. Protection disabling and anti-analysis
The script tries to modify the following registry keys:
RegWrite("HKCU64\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System",
"DisableTaskMgr", "REG_DWORD", "1")
RegDelete("HKLM64\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SPP\Clients")
RegWrite("HKLM64\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System",
"EnableLUA", "REG_DWORD", "0")
And it:
Disables Task Manager
Turns off the system protection
Disables UAC (User Account Controls)
9/12

Formbook will terminate if it finds VMware or VirtualBox processes running in the victim's
system and if the 'D' drive has space of less than 1MB:
VMwaretray.exe
Vbox.exe
VMwareUser.exe
VMwareService.exe
VboxService.exe
vpcmap.exe
VBoxTray.exe
If DriveSpaceFree ("d:\") <1 And ProcessExists ([VMWare or VBox]) then Exit

4. Check default browser
The script will check the HKCR\http\shell\open\command registry key to know which
Internet browser the victim's machine uses by default.

5. Formbook deletion and termination
Formbook will look for the svshost.exe process and terminate if it finds more than two
svshost.exe processes running, as shown in Figure 9.

Conclusion
Despite Formbook infostealer having been around for a couple of years now, it only came to
public attention after it was extensively used in spam campaigns in late 2017. The fact that
Formbook wasn't noticed before is probably because its developers didn't release the
builder to the public, so it was easy for them to track its activities and turn it off if they found
that it was being used for purposes for which it was not intended or if it was gaining too
much attention from the security community. Despite not being broadly used, Formbook
represents a real threat, due to it being stealthier and more powerful than keyloggers.
Similar to the Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT), the author of Formbook initially
offered a beta version of the product free of charge in order to receive feedback and make
improvements.
The 'ng-Coder' user indicates that Formbook should not be used for malicious purposes,
and after the spam campaigns were made public, he blocked Formbook's sales until further
notice. According to 'ng-Coder', Formbook should only be used to spy on family members
or employees if the user has the explicit right to do so. However, this claim itself is dubious
given the barely legitimate nature of the use of such software.
