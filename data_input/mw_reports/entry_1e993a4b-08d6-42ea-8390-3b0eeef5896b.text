EternityTeam: a new prominent threat group on
underground forums
blog.sekoia.io/eternityteam-a-new-prominent-threat-group-on-underground-forums/
May 17, 2022

This blog post on EternityTeam originally came from a FLINT (SEKOIA.IO Flash Intelligence)
report sent to our clients on April 12, 2022.
During our monitoring of Dark Web cybercrime forums, we came across EternityTeam: a
new active and organized threat group that is developing and advertising several malware.
We have identified different pieces of malware related to this group: Eternity Stealer, Eternity
Worm, Eternity Miner, Eternity Clipper, Eternity Botnet, and Eternity Ransomware.
There are several reasons to believe that the EternityTeam could become a prominent
malware seller and that their malware could spread in the wild:
their malware software capability;
their presence on numerous underground forums;
their effort invested in the marketing;
the number of Eternity Stealer samples identified by SEKOIA.IO in the wild;
the “project” of the Eternity threat group has been “verified and approved” by the
administrators of several cybercrime forums in early February 2022, as a guarantee of
the worthiness of the products they sell.

In this blog post, we describe the activities on underground forums of EternityTeam
members, share an overview of the different malware and present a quick analysis of the
Eternity Stealer that appears to be their best-selling malware.
EternityTeam activity on underground forums
EternityTeam is a group that develops and sells different malware since at least January
2022. The threat group is present on numerous Russian-speaking underground forums, such
as XSS, UfoLabs, BHF, RuTOR, SkyNetZone, DarkClub, and others for advertising and
selling their malware.
We noticed that several profiles are selling the EternityTeam malware, for example:
UnderD0g advertises all products on the UfoLabs forum with the Telegram channel
(t[.]me/EternityTeam) of the EternityTeam. It is interesting to note that UnderD0g has a
profile on the XSS forum but has not used it to communicate about Eternity activities.
Neizvestnost74 advertises, with its own Telegram profile, all the products (except the
worm) on XSS, UfoLabs and BHF forums, among many others. The threat actor has
entered the hacking forum scene at least since 2019 for selling dedicated servers,
malware, or for buying brute force services.
EternityTeam is a recent profile that has only advertised the Eternity Stealer and the
Eternity Worm on several forums.
CyberSurprice advertises information stealer on numerous forums. As EternityTeam,
this profile seems to have been created for purposes of the Eternity projects.

2/10

All profiles are responsive to questions from potential or current clients, either on technical
(detection) or business issues. The group members communicate in Russian (mainly) and
English.
In addition to this, EternityTeam maintains a Telegram channel (t[.]me/s/EternityMalware), an
.onion website (malwarewrn7fvd7zq243d74dxs3ca4wh5kw6i2opkzeusuoajtd2j5yd[.]onion)
and a GitHub repository (github[.]com/L1ghtM4n) in which they share details, videos,
updates about all their malware in their catalog.
In the light of the above, we can assume that EternityTeam is a new group of several threat
actors familiar with the cybercrime ecosystem. They surely started their business for financial
gain.

Eternity’s malware catalog
The Eternity information stealer, advertised as the Eternity Stealer or Eternity Project, is
the one that interests the most on forums. More details on this malware are given in the
following part.

The Eternity Miner is sold for $110. It aims to mine Monero cryptocurrency on Windows
hosts. The malware implements several defense evasion techniques, such as masking as a
system process, hiding from the task manager, preventing hibernation, and persistence.

The Eternity Clipper substitutes the cryptocurrency wallet address of the intended recipient
with that of the attacker. It is sold for $99.
The Eternity Botnet (also named Eternity Dropper) allows an attacker to perform DDoS
attacks using different methods (HTTP, TCP Flood or UDP Flood), and to drop files on the
infected host using UAC bypass. The agent builder and the administration panel are sold for
$150 a month.
The Eternity Worm is able to spread itself over documents, USB, Cloud, and Discord. The
price for Eternity Worm is $300 and the source price is $1200.

The Eternity Ransomware is only advertised on their Telegram channel. According to
EternityTeam’s description, it is a generic ransomware that encrypts all documents, photos,
databases on disks, local shares, USB drives, removes system restore points and deletes
shadow copies, among other classic features.

Focus on the Eternity Stealer
As mentioned in the introduction, we discovered the threat group, and its malware catalog, in
February 2022, shortly after its emergence, during our Dark Web monitoring. We managed to
find a sample of Eternity Stealer on a file-sharing platform, and we quickly analyzed it.
Eternity Stealer is a complete information stealer written in .NET and sold with the malwareas-a-service model for $99 per month. The malware targets personal information from:
several browsers (passwords, cookies, credit cards, autofill data, history, and
bookmarks);
browser cryptocurrency extensions;
cryptocurrency wallets;
numerous applications (password managers, messengers, VPN and FTP clients, and
gaming software).
We found that Eternity Stealer is able to steal credentials of Growtopia accounts. Growtopia
is a game with almost endless possibilities for world creation, developed by the French video
game company Ubisoft. This stealing capability echoes the profitable and illegal business of
Roblox (a mega-popular gaming platform) account theft, often targeting young players. As
mentioned in the Vice article, attackers stole over ten thousand dollars worth of virtual items
in a few minutes. Information stealers targeting video game accounts is not a new trend, but
it later appears to be on the rise. This business can be very lucrative as huge virtual markets
exist for many video games, and the targeted users are often young and not very careful
concerning cyber risks.
Investigating Eternity Stealer samples confirm this trend. Indeed we found some samples
distributed as a glitch program for Growtopia (“Growtopia Growtoken Glitch 3.82+.exe“), or a
cracked version of Growtopia (“Growtopia_Hack_3.82.exe“).
Regarding data exfiltration, Eternity Stealer sends the stolen data to the Eternity Team
servers via HTTPS POST requests. Data is then redirected to the attacker on its Telegram
bot.
SEKOIA.IO Threat & Detection Research Team will continue to monitor EternityTeam
activities, as well as their malware catalog to provide contextualized and actionable
intelligence on these threats.
In conclusion, information from our Dark Web monitoring is a data source in its own right.
The results allow us to identify trends and emerging threats. SEKOIA.IO analysts then
make this information actionable for our clients.
