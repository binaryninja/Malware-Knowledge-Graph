September 01, 2020 Michael Raggi and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
Executive Summary
Beginning in the first half of 2020, the rapid international spread of the COVID-19 virus
introduced a shift within the threat landscape towards pandemic-themed social
engineering lures. Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting
COVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against
established and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a
phishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance on
COVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have
dubbed “Sepulcher”. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies,
non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic
affairs. Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to
historic Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads
linked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020
targeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher
malware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked
to historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT
malware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan
dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint
researchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously
been documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetanthemed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term
realignment of TA413’s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against
the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized
intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020
before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.
Delivery and Exploitation
In the latter half of March 2020, researchers identified a malicious email sent to
numerous entities involved with economic policy and forecasting within Europe. The
emails contained a weaponized RTF attachment that impersonated the WHO’s “Critical

preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19, Interim guidance”
document. This guidance was initially published on March 7, 2020, while the weaponized
attachment was delivered by threat actors on March 16, 2020. When the malicious RTF
attachment named “Covdi.rtf” is executed, it exploits a Microsoft Equation Editor
vulnerability and installs an embedded malicious RTF object in the form of a Windows
meta-file (WMF) to the file directory %\AppData\Local\Temp\wd4sx.wmf. This method
is used by a known variant of the Royal Road RTF weaponizer which is shared among
numerous Chinese APT actors. The execution of the WMF file ultimately results in the
delivery and installation of the previously unidentified Sepulcher malware.

The emails in this campaign originated from the Yahoo free-mail sender address
tseringkanyaq@yahoo[.]com. This sender account was first written about in a joint report
by Citizen Lab, the Munk School of Global Affairs, and the University of Toronto in 2013,
which described Chinese APT activity. The report indicated this email address had been
used in phishing campaigns from May 2012 through June 2013 to target Tibetan
members of civil society. Specifically, the sender address is thought to impersonate
Kanyag Tsering, a Tibetan monk and activist that held a high profile in the media during
the historic campaign time period. The email address delivered malicious attachments
that installed ShadowNet, Duojeen, and PubSab (OS X) malware. The report goes on to
note that these malware payloads were found to share infrastructure with LuckyCat
malware that was identified by TrendMicro also being deployed against Tibetan targets in
2012. LuckyCat malware was more recently linked to Chinese APT malware targeting the
international Tibetan community via an APK variant reported by Talos Intelligence in
January 2019. The LuckyCat Android RAT utilized in early 2019 used the same
infrastructure as ExileRAT payloads to target members of a Central Tibetan
Administration mailing list.
Following the Sepulcher malware campaign in March 2020, a subsequent malicious email
campaign delivering this malware was identified on July 27, 2020. The email included a
malicious PowerPoint (PPSX) attachment conspicuously named “TIBETANS BEING HIT
BY DEADLY VIRUS THAT CARRIES A GUN AND SPEAKS CHINESE.ppsx”. The SMTP
header From field impersonated the “Women's Association Tibetan," while the
attachment, once opened, referenced “Tibet, Activism and Information”. When the
PowerPoint attachment is executed, it calls out to the IP 118.99.13[.]4 to download a
Sepulcher malware payload named “file.dll”. Additionally, the distinct C2 request

hxxp://118.99.13[.]4:1234/qqqzqa that occurs at that time has been seen previously in
association with TA413 malware campaigns. Upon the delivery of the payload “file.dll” it
is saved as “credential.dll” and executed resulting in a C2 communication with the
domain Dalailamatrustindia.ddns[.]net. The attachment title, decoy content,
impersonated sender, and Dalai Lama Trust in India-themed C2 affirms this campaign’s
focus on individuals associated with the Tibetan Leadership in Exile.

GUN AND SPEAKS CHINESE.ppsx.
This Sepulcher malware campaign is highly reminiscent of the January 2019 campaign
that utilized PPSX attachments to deliver ExileRAT malware, previously documented by
Talos Intelligence. The foremost commonality between these campaigns, apart from the
attachment type and content of the PowerPoint, is the sender email
“mediabureauin@gmail[.]com" which was shared in both the historic ExileRat campaign
and the recent Sepulcher malware campaign from 2020. The intermittent use of a single
email address in multiple APT campaigns spanning nearly eight years is uncommon in
cyber threat research. While it is not impossible for multiple APT groups to utilize a single
operator account (sender address) against distinct targets in different campaigns, it is
unlikely. It is further unlikely that this sender reuse after several years would occur twice
in a four-month period between March and July, with both instances delivering the same
Sepulcher malware family. The sharing of delivery/hosting infrastructure, malware
payloads, or post-exploitation tools have been observed across Chinese APT groups and

can be considered more common. However, the use of operator accounts spanning
multiple APT campaigns is much less common. It is less advantageous to share operator
accounts as the creation of new free-mail accounts for phishing delivery is trivial and does
not represent a cost barrier to operation. Additionally, it increases the likelihood of
detection by targeted organizations. Although the re-emergence of two publicly known
sender accounts after multiple years is unusual, the use of a known sender account to
target a new group of recipients in this case may represent an opsec failure resulting from
a broader re-tasking of existing APT threat actors in response to an unprecedented global
crisis.
Sepulcher Malware
The Sepulcher malware payload (SHA256:
4a4a959aef64ea48e2b831468119180d0af4b5b685c35170f5db3f001b9cc319) observed in
the March 2020 campaign targeting European economic targets was analyzed for this
publication. The file “wd4sx.wmf” is installed by the initial RTF attachment upon
execution and contains the final Sepulcher malware payload and a payload dropper.
Sepulcher is a basic RAT payload that can gather intelligence on the resources of the
infected system, spawn a reverse CMD shell, and read from and write to file.
Initially, the WMF file installs a temporary file named “OSEB979.tmp” to the Windows
temporary directory that serves as a payload dropper. It installs the final Sepulcher
payload “credential.dll” to the directory %AppData%\Roaming\Identities\Credential.dll.
It then creates a scheduled task named “lemp” which uses rundll32.exe to run the
Sepulcher payload and call the export function “GetObjectCount” on an hourly basis. This
scheduled task serves as a persistence mechanism for Sepulcher malware.

schtasks /create /tr "rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\Identities\Credential.dll,GetObjectCount" /tn "lemp" /sc HOURLY

Figure 4: Scheduled task and persistence mechanism for executing Sepulcher payload.
The Sepulcher configuration is stored in the registry under the Registry Key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WAB\Resources. It contains four distinct
keys named “DefaultString”, “Credentials”, “Security”, and “Property”. The
“DefaultString” is randomly generated by CoCreatGuid() with the initial formatting done
by the multibyte _sprintf_(). This is then stored in the registry by RegSetValueExW()
which uses the wide character type. This results in a broken encoding that renders as
Chinese characters. This should not be interpreted as an indication that the threat actor is
using Chinese characters in the malware configuration, despite broader attribution
pointing to Chinese state associated actors. The remaining three keys “Credentials”,
“Security”, and “Property” represent the three C2 servers in encrypted format that are
utilized by the malware. The below algorithm is used to decrypt the C2 servers which, in
this sample, are revealed to be the IP address 107.151.194[.]197 utilizing ports 80, 443,

and 8080. Notably, this IP address hosted a single domain welfaretibet[.]tk as of April 5,
2020. This suggests that threat actors did not establish standalone network infrastructure
for targeting European economic entities and intended to utilize this IP to persist in
targeting entities related to Tibetan matters in the future.

Sepulcher malware has seven work modes that include conducting reconnaissance on an
infected host, spawning a reverse command shell, reading from file, and writing to file.
More granularly, additional commands exist within the intelligence
gathering/reconnaissance work modes (1002, 1003, 1004) which carry out

reconnaissance functionality within the infected host. These commands include obtaining
information about the drives, file information, directory statistics, directory paths,
directory content, running processes, and services. Additionally, it is capable of more
active functionalities like deleting directories and files, creating directories, moving file
source to destination, spawning a shell to execute commands, terminating a process,
restarting a service, changing a service start type, and deleting a service.

Command and Control
The malware receives commands including various mode commands and sub-commands
via the C2 addresses decrypted from the malware’s configuration. The initial
communication is initiated by the client via a single byte XOR encrypted handshake
packet and completed via a server-to-client packet that is not encrypted. The
communication then continues with a single byte XOR encrypted client-to-server
PACKET_HELLO that specifies the malware command mode. In the case of modes 1002,
1003, and 1004, which are the commands that initialize the intelligence
gathering/reconnaissance capabilities of the malware, the server replays the
PACKET_HELLO with mode commands in the initial PACKET_HANDSHAKE via a

PACKET_COMMAND. The same method of C2 communication was observed for
Sepulcher sub-commands, however, the format of observed sub-commands delivered via
the “COMMAND_DATA” field varied depending on content of the PACKET_COMMAND.
Once a PACKET_COMMAND is received, the result is stored in a %TEMP% file on the
host. Finally, that result is exfiltrated to the C2 server using the above described
PACKET_COMMAND method.

Conclusion
The adoption of COVID-19 lures by Chinese APT groups in espionage campaigns was a
growing trend in the threat landscape during the first half of 2020. This was thought to be
effective decoy fodder by threat actors as was observed in the WHO content that was
coopted as part of the TA413 March 2020 campaign targeting European economic
entities. However, following an initial urgency in intelligence collection around the health
of western global economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to normalcy
was observed in both the targets and decoy content of TA413 campaigns. While the new
Sepulcher malware is far from groundbreaking, its combination with timely social
engineering lures masquerading as critical guidance from the WHO leveraged an urgent
global crisis to entice victims. This campaign’s specific focus on European economic,
diplomatic, and legislative entities belies a possible momentary realignment for Chinese
cyber espionage groups to collect information on global economies cast into upheaval as a
result of COVID-19. However, in the case of TA413 that shift may have been short lived.

didactic PowerPoint attachments in later July again tie TA413 to its emblematic targeting
of the Tibetan community. Despite the recurring use of publicly disclosed email
addresses, a pedestrian RAT, and the recycling of delivery methods observed over a year
ago, the targeting shift between these two campaigns paint a conspicuously contemporary
portrait of a rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape in 2020.
