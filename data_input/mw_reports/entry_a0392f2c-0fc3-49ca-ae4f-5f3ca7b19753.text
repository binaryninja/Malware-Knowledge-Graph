How this APT continues to evolve its arsenal
SUMMARY
•

Cisco Talos is tracking an increase in the SideCopy APT's activities targeting government
personnel in India using themes and tactics similar to APT36 (aka Mythic Leopard and
Transparent Tribe).

•

SideCopy is an APT group that mimics the Sidewinder APT’s infection chains to deliver their
own set of malware.

•

We’ve discovered multiple infection chains delivering bespoke and commodity remote access
trojans (RATs) such as CetaRAT, Allakore and njRAT.

•

Apart from the three known malware families utilized by SideCopy, Talos also discovered the usage
of four new custom RAT families and two other commodity RATs known as “Lilith” and “Epicenter.”

•

Post-infection activities by SideCopy consist of deploying a variety of plugins, ranging from file
enumerators to credential-stealers and keyloggers.

WHAT’S NEW?
Cisco Talos has observed an expansion in the activity of
SideCopy malware campaigns, targeting entities in India. In
the past, the attackers have used malicious LNK files and
documents to distribute their staple C#-based RAT. We are
calling this malware “CetaRAT.” SideCopy also relies heavily
on the use of Allakore RAT, a publicly available Delphibased RAT.
Recent activity from the group, however, signals a boost in
their development operations. Talos has discovered multiple
new RAT families and plugins currently used in SideCopy
infection chains.
Targeting tactics and themes observed in SideCopy
campaigns indicate a high degree of similarity to the
Transparent Tribe APT (aka APT36) also targeting India.
These include using decoys posing as operational
documents belonging to the military and think tanks and
honeytrap-based infections.

involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final
payloads.
Talos also discovered the usage of other new RATs and
plugins. These include DetaRAT, ReverseRAT, MargulasRAT
and ActionRAT. We’ve also discovered the use of
commodity RATs such as njRAT, Lilith and Epicenter by this
group since as early as 2019.
Successful infection of a victim results in the installation of
independent plugins to serve specific purposes such as file
enumeration, browser password stealing and keylogging.

SO WHAT?
These campaigns provide insights into the adversary’s
operations:

•

Their preliminary infection chains involve delivering their
staple RATs.

•

Successful infection of a victim leads to the introduction
of a variety of modular plugins.

HOW DID IT WORK?

•

SideCopy’s infection chains have remained relatively
consistent with minor variations — using malicious LNK files
as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain

Development of new RAT malware is an indication that
this group of attackers are rapidly evolving their malware
arsenal and post-infection tools since 2019.

•

Their current infrastructure setup indicates a special
interest in victims in Pakistan and India.

How this APT continues to evolve its arsenal
BACKGROUND
SideCopy campaigns use tactics and techniques that
mimic the SideWinder APT group to deploy their own
set of malware. For instance, this group actively utilizes
artifact names and infection vectors identical to the
Sidewinder group.
SideCopy infection chains primarily consist of archive
files containing malicious LNK files delivered to the
victims. The filenames are meant to social engineer the
victims into opening the LNK files, in turn, infecting them
with SideCopy malware. What follows is a convoluted
combination of malicious HTML Application files (HTA) and
DOT NET-based loader DLLs that instrument CetaRAT and
Allakore on the endpoints.
EARLY INFECTION CHAIN
The earliest discovered infection chain consisted of a LNK
file that pulled down and executed an HTA from a remote

location. This HTA would decode and instrument a loader
DLL in memory to drop CetaRAT and another DLL (DUser.
dll) (Figure 1).
The dropped DLL is side-loaded into credwiz.exe. The DLL
then executes CetaRAT on the infected endpoint, thereby
completing the infection chain.
The actors used this method in 2019 and have evolved it
since then. This primitive infection chain doesn’t consist
of decoy documents or images and is missing the Allakore
RAT component (Figure 2).
LATEST CETARAT INFECTION CHAINS
Beginning 2020 and into 2021, we saw the attackers
improve their infection chains. These infections also begin
with malicious LNK files delivered to the victims. However,
what follows is a combination of three HTA files, three
loader DLLs, two instances of CetaRAT in some cases, and
Allakore. This indicates an effort to modularize the attack
chains, although it’s over-modularized in this case.

Figure 3: Latest SideCopy infection chain.

Figure 4: Latest SideCopy infection chain.

The latest infection chains have also adopted the practice
of displaying a decoy document (PDF) or image to the
victims (Figure 3).

•

Stage No. 1 — LNK
The malicious LNK contains a command (Figure 4) to run a
malicious HTA file hosted on an attacker-controlled website
via mshta.exe.
Stage No. 2 — HTA
The malicious HTA file carries out the following activities:

•

Creates a JavaScript file to restart the endpoint after

© 2021 Cisco. All rights reserved.

the malicious HTA has completed the infection process.
(The JavaScript waits for a specified time and restarts
the system, enough for HTA to complete the infection.)
Load and invoke a malicious Dot Net-based loader DLL
(Stage 2A) into memory.

Stage No. 2A — Loader DLL
The malicious Dot Net-based loader DLL is responsible for:

•

Decompressing a decoy PDF and displaying it to the
victim on the endpoint.

•

Downloads another malicious HTA (Stage No. 3A) from
a remote URL and executes it on the endpoint.

talos-external@cisco.com | talosintelligence.com

page 5 of 23

InSideCopy:
How this APT continues to evolve its arsenal
•

Downloads and executes another
malicious HTA file (Stage No. 4)
from a remote URL.

The decoy document displayed to the
victim in this case is an internal Indian
Ministry of Defense (MoD) circular
related to their Human Resources
Management System (HRMS) (Figure 5).
Stage No. 3 — Malicious HTA
This malicious HTA is similar to those
seen previously (usually seen as Stage
No. 2 in other infection chains). It is
used to deploy the malicious CetaRAT
embedded in the HTA file.
In some cases, we’ve observed
instances of this malicious HTA
deploying two distinct CetaRAT
payloads on the same endpoint, a
deviation from the usual infection chain.
Stage No. 4 — Malicious HTA
This malicious HTA is similar to the
HTA seen in Stage No. 3A of the attack
chain. This HTA also:

•

Loads another loader DLL into
memory (Stage No. 4A).

•

Collects AV product names and
passes them to the loader DLL
(Stage No. 4A) along with the
credwiz.exe binary and DUser.dll
malicious DLL to be side-loaded.

Stage No. 4A — Malicious loader DLL
This DLL is responsible for dropping
DUser.dll (Stage No. 4B side-loaded
into credwiz) into a variable location,
depending on the presence of a
specific anti-virus products installed
on the endpoint:

•

Kaspersky

•

Avira

•

QuickHeal

•

Bitdefender

•

Avast

•

Windows
Defender

Figure 6: njRAT infection chain.

This loader DLL also persists Allakore RAT on the
endpoint. The side-loaded DLL is then responsible for
executing Allakore.

Allakore RAT is a publicly available Delphi-based RAT. It is
usually called “Cyrus client” in SideCopy infection chains.
Its capabilities include:
Upload and download files.

•

Capture screenshots from the endpoint.

•

Enumerate directories and files.

•

Keylogging.

•

Steal current clipboard data.

•

Registration.pdf.exe

MSI-BASED INFECTION CHAIN

NJRAT INFECTIONS
Another recently discovered infection chain (Figure 6) used
by SideCopy completely abandons CetaRAT and Allakore
and uses njRAT instead. This infection chain is simpler than
the ones seen previously.
A second variation of njRAT infection chain uses selfextracting RAR-based dropper executables that consists of:

•

Malicious VB script to set up persistence for njRAT deployed by the dropper.

•

njRAT binary dropped and executed by the dropper.

© 2021 Cisco. All rights reserved.

The decoy document is usually a PDF displayed to the
victim. These PDFs mainly consist of themes related to
the Indian Army and government.

Some examples of the self-extracting dropper filenames:

Stage No. 4B - Allakore

•

•

Around mid-2020, we observed a deviation from the LNKbased infection chain. In this case, the attackers hosted a
malicious archive (ZIP) on an attacker-controlled website
freewindowssoftware[.]com. The ZIP file contained
an MSI file posing as an installer for the “Libre Video
Locker” application. On installation, the malicious MSI
would install Allakore RAT into the “Program Files\Libre
Software Corporation\LibreVideoLocker” folder
(Figure 7).
The final payloads consisted of three components:

•

Loader EXE: Executed first and masquerades as a Libre
video player application. It is, however, meant to run
Allakore and the malicious BAT file.

It is based on CetaRAT.

•

MargulasRAT: This is another custom RAT used as part
of SideCopy operations. The dropper for MargulasRAT
masquerades as a VPN application from India’s National
Informatics Centre (NIC).

•

Allakore: Allakore is a Delphi-based RAT first observed
in 2015. This RAT has been used by SideCopy
extensively, along with CetaRAT.

•

ActionRAT: ActionRAT is another Delphi-based
RAT used in SideCopy’s operations. At first glance,
it looks quite similar to Allakore but is distinct in its
implementation. We also found a C#-based version of
the RAT, indicating that the attackers have ported it to
the Dot Net platform, as well.

•

Lilith: Lilith is a C++-based RAT first observed in 2016.
SideCopy used a customized version of Lilith in early
2019. Lilith has also been utilized by another APT
named “TICK” in 2018 - 19.

•

EpicenterRAT: Epicenter is another commodity RAT
observed in the wild since 2012. SideCopy’s usage of
Epicenter dates back to as early as 2018 - 19.

This is an overview of the different final stages of infections.
RATS
SideCopy infections utilize a number of RATs. The RAT
payloads discovered by Talos so far are:

•

•

•

CetaRAT: SideCopy’s staple RAT first seen in the
wild in 2019. This was already disclosed publicly. We
are calling it “CetaRAT” to identify it throughout this
research piece.
DetaRAT — C#-based RAT: A previously unknown C#based RAT that contains several RAT capabilities similar
to CetaRAT.
ReverseRAT: Another previously undiscovered C#-

PLUGINS
In addition to full-fledged RATs, SideCopy utilizes modular
plugins to carry out specific malicious tasks on the
infected endpoint:

•

File manager: A file management component that can
enumerate, download and upload files on the endpoint
from/to the C2.

•

Keyloggers: There are two keyloggers used by SideCopy.

•

•

○

Xeytan: A publicly available C#-based keylogger
available since 2016.

○

Lavao: Another C#-based keylogger.

Browser credential stealers: Again, there are two
types of stealers used:
○

C-based stealer component to steal passwords
from Firefox and Chrome.

○

C#-based stealer component to steal Chromium
browser passwords.

Nodachi: A previously unknown set of plugins utilized by SideCopy we’re calling “Nodachi.” These
Golang-based plugins have reconnaissance and
file-stealing abilities targeting an Indian multi-factor
authentication app known as “Kavach.”

RAT ANALYSIS

command codes (Figure 9) with a
hardcoded key for communicating
with its C2 servers. Its malicious
capabilities include:

•

Files management: Create,
move, rename and delete
directories and files.

•

File enumeration: Retrieves
detailed directory and file
information recursively, including
creation and last access times.

•

Exfiltration and infiltration:
Download and upload files from
and to the C2.

•

Audio: Record and upload
audio files.

•

Remote control: Control mouse
cursor and clicks.

REVERSERAT
This is a simple C#-based malware that opens up a
reverse shell (Figure 10) to its C2 server using cmd.exe.
This reverse shell also has code built into it to monitor
removable drive events (Figure 11), such as connection and
removal.
MARGULASRAT
MargualsRAT is distributed via another C#-based dropper
(Figure 12) binary. The dropper masquerades as the same
VPN we mentioned previously. NIC is responsible for
providing IT services, such as email and VPN access, to
Indian government employees, including military personnel.
Another variant of the dropper deploys MargulasRAT after
displaying a decoy PDF to the victim (Figure 13).
This infection chain uses VBScripts to persist MargulasRAT
via registry, while the dropper downloads the RAT from a
remote location (Figure 14).
MargulasRAT (Figure 15) is limited in capabilities, but does
include:

•

Screenshot capture: Capture a screenshot of the resolution specified by the C2, AES encrypt and send.

•

Update self: Receives an encoded binary from C2,

it. Runs cmd.exe to terminate
itself afterward.

•

Download more payloads:
Receives a name and encoded
payload data from the C2, then
write it to disk and execute it on
the infected endpoint.

•

Stop communications: Terminate
communication session with the
C2 until the next run.

We’ve observed unimplemented
command codes in the MargualsRAT
indicating that this RAT is actively in
development by the attackers.

Figure 14: Malicious VBScript used to persist MargulasRAT across reboots.

ALLAKORE
Allakore is a publicly available Delphibased RAT that has consistently been
used in SideCopy operations along

22). The file paths recorded must
match the following extensions:
doc, ppt, xls, txt, pdf, zip,
mdb, accdb, db, rar, jpg,
bmp, gif, csv, bmp, docx,
pptx, xlsx and png.
The files manager will also send
preliminary system information to the
C2 and receive a command code in
return:
hname=<MachineName>&uname=
<Username> &osname=<Windows
ProductName>&hid=<processor
ID_BIOS_SerialNumber_Disk_
Signature>&mcc=<MACAddress>
&avname=<AVInstalled>&arc=

Where:

•

hname = computer name.

•

uname = username of currently
logged in user.

•

osname = Windows version name
string.

•

hid = hardware id i.e. a combination of processor ID, serial
number and disk signature

•

mcc = Mac Address of the endpoint.

•

avname = either “Defender”,
“Avira” or “N/A” depending on
whichever AV is found installed.

•

arc = “x64” or “x86”

Command codes:

•

•

“filelist” and “updatefilelist”:
Send recorded file paths from
“YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_di_output.
txt” to C2 server.
“download|”: Read contents
of file path specified by C2 and

•

“upload|”: Get specified file from C2 and write to specified location on disk.

•

“execute|”: Download a specific file to a location on a disk specified by the C2
and execute it.

SideCopy also uses a document copier (Figure 23). This component searches for
files with specific extensions across removable and fixed drives and creates an
encrypted copy for itself. The encrypted copy may be exfiltrated later by another
component. So far, this component only searches for doc, docx, ppt, pptx and
pdf files.

We’ve also found standalone implementations of the
document copier (called “UPirate”). This consists of
document copying and encryption capabilities without the
C2 functionality of the file manager component.
BROWSER CREDENTIAL STEALER
We’ve observed two flavors of browser credential stealer
components utilized by SideCopy (Figure 24). The first is a
C-based stealer that targets Firefox and Chrome.
The second credential stealer is C#-based and targets
Chromium-based browsers, including:

•

Credentials extracted from any of these browsers installed
on the endpoint are then written to a temporary log file on
disk and subsequently exfiltrated to a DropBox location
(Figure 25).
KEYLOGGERS
SideCopy uses two dedicated keyloggers for recording
keystrokes, the aforementioned Xeytan (Figure 26) and
Lavao (Figure 27), which is a custom keylogger first seen
around mid-2019 that records timestamps, Window names
and pressed key codes into a log file.

InSideCopy:
How this APT continues to evolve its arsenal
Nodachi is meant for reconnaissance
and stealing different types of data
from the victim’s endpoint:

•

Credential stealing: The malware
uses the goLazagne library to
steal the login credentials from
the infected endpoint, such as
internet browsers, credential
managers and some sysadmin
tools (Figure 28). Once the login
credentials are obtained, it copies
these files over to the attacker’s
Google Drive.

•

Steal ‘Kavach’ data: Kavach (hindi
for “Armor”) is an authentication
system used by the Government of India’s (GoI) NIC agency.
Kavach provides its users with
an MFA application/client used
for authentication of employees
to access GoI’s IT infrastructure,
such as email. The malware looks
for the “kavach.db” database
containing login credentials of users in the directory:

Figure 28:

C:\Users\<username>\
AppData\Roaming\kavach.db
If found, the file is copied to

uses the goLazagne library to lists
all files with specific extensions
on the endpoint: .docx, .doc,
.pptx, .xls and .xml. The files
found are logged into a file that
is then exfiltrated again to the
attackers via Google Drive APIs.
One variant of Nodachi also displayed a decoy PDF downloaded
from an attacker-owned Google
Drive link. This decoy document
is the same as the one seen in
one of the latest CetaRAT infection chains (Figure 30).

TRACKING AND DELIVERY
INFRASTRUCTURE

The data recorded in the log files consists of the following
requester information:

SideCopy’s delivery infrastructure consists of either setting
up fake websites or using compromised websites to deliver
malicious artifacts to specific victims.

•

Source IP address.

•

Device type: tablet, mobile or computer.

•

Operating system name.

The delivery scripts verify that requests to receive artifacts/
payloads are from two specific geographies: India and
Pakistan (Figure 31). If this matches, then a payload or
decoy is served to the requester.

•

User-Agent string.

•

Architecture type: 32- or 64-bit.

•

Browser name.

All requests are logged to a log file on the delivery server to
keep track of artifacts served to potential victims (Figure 32).

•

Referrer value.

•

Timestamp of request.

•

City and country of origin.

OBSERVATIONS
AND ANALYSES
TARGETING
SideCopy uses themes predominantly
designed to target military personnel
in the Indian subcontinent. Many of
the LNK files and decoy documents
used in their attacks pose as internal,
operational documents of the Indian
Army.
One infection posed as a seniority
list of the Indian Army as recently as
early 2021 (Figure 33).
Apart from military themes, SideCopy
also utilized publications, calls for
papers/proposals and job openings
related to think tanks in India to target
potential victims.
In one of the infections, the attackers
used a malicious LNK file to deliver
Allakore and CetaRAT to its victims.
This specific attack chain used
a decoy document posing as an
advertisement of a call for proposals
for the Chair of Excellence 2021 for
the Centre For Land and Warfare
Studies (CLAWS) in India (Figure 34).

Figure 33: Decoy document related to the Indian Army.

Interestingly, the same theme
was seen in another recent attack
conducted by the Transparent Tribe
APT to deliver ObliqueRAT payloads
to their victims.
In another instance, we observed the
attackers using a decoy document
consisting of an article published by
the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies
(CENJOWS) in India. The article is
a Geo Strategic Scan from August
2020 discussing the political and
economic implications of resuming
diplomatic talks between the U.S.
and China (Figure 34).

How this APT continues to evolve its arsenal
More recently, an issue brief of the
Observer Research Foundation (ORF,
another independent think tank based
out of India) was used as a decoy
by SideCopy in an attack delivering
njRAT to its victims (Figure 35).
Another attack from 2020 shows
targeting of diplomatic personnel
— those working in embassies
specifically. The decoy document
employed in this case consisted of
a circular from the Indian Ministry
of External Affairs (MEA) to its
employees and attachees. This
infection chain also delivered Allakore
and CetaRAT (Figure 36).
Besides all of these email campaigns
we’ve outlined, SideCopy also
uses honeytraps to lure victims in.
These infections typically consist
of malicious LNK files that display
explicit photos of women. The
infection chain again delivers
CetaRAT and Allakore. We’ve also
observed APT36 (Transparent Tribe)
use these types of honeytraps
extensively in campaigns targeting
members of India’s military with
CrimsonRAT.

Figure 35: ORF decoy
document used in
njRAT infections.

Also like APT36, SideCopy clones
legitimate websites that actually just
serve malicious content.
In the case of SideCopy, we
discovered afghannewsnetwork[.]
com, a website posing as the
Pajhwok Afghan News, an Afghani
independent news agency (Figure
37). This website was used as
a C2 for actionRAT, delivered
using malicious LNKs that used
decoy documents that looked like
professional resumes - another
targeting tactic closely resembling
APT36 (Transparent Tribe).

External Affairs Circular

CREDENTIAL HARVESTING
One of SideCopy’s central motives is credential
harvesting. Specifically, the group looks to steal access
credentials from central Indian government employees.
The group commonly targets Kavach, an MFA app used
across India’s government. Kavach allows employees
(including military personnel) to access IT resources such
as email services.
SideCopy has shown a particular interest in Kavach,
deploying the njRAT malware with special victim IDs of
“kavach.” They also use GoLang-based file recon plugins
(Nodachi) to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases
from infected devices. Some droppers for MargulasRAT
also masqueraded as installers for Kavach on Windows.
We’ve also discovered phishing portals operated by
SideCopy posing as the GoI’s webmail to trick victims
into divulging their email credentials (Figure 38).

CONCLUSION
What started as a simple infection vector by SideCopy to
deliver a custom RAT (CetaRAT), has evolved into multiple
variants of infection chains delivering several RATs. The use
of these many infection techniques — ranging from LNK files
to self-extracting RAR EXEs and MSI-based installers — is an
indication that the actor is aggressively working to infect their
victims. This threat actor is also rapidly evolving their malware
set using a combination of custom and commodity RATs and
plugins. The variety of post-infection plugins specifically used
by the attacker signifies a focus on espionage.
Targeting tactics used by SideCopy consists of multiple themes,
quite similar to those utilized by APT36: military, diplomatic and
honeytraps. This indicates that the group continues to target
government entities in the Indian subcontinent.
