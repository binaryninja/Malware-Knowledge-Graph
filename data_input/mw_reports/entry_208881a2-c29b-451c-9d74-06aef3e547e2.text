Indicators of Compromise Associated with LockBit 2.0
Ransomware
Summary
LockBit 2.0 operates as an affiliate-based Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and employs a wide
variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense
and mitigation. LockBit 2.0 ransomware compromises victim networks through a variety of
techniques, including, but not limited to, purchased access, unpatched vulnerabilities, insider
access, and zero day exploits.
After compromising a victim network, LockBit 2.0 actors use publicly available tools such as
Mimikatz to escalate privileges. The threat actors then use both publicly available and custom
tools to exfiltrate data followed by encryption using the Lockbit malware. The actors always
leave a ransom note in each affected directory within victim systems, which provides
instructions on how to obtain the decryption software. The ransom note also threatens to leak
exfiltrated victim data on the LockBit 2.0 leak site and demands a ransom to avoid these
actions.

In July 2021, LockBit 2.0 released an update which featured the automatic encryption of devices
across windows domains by abusing Active Directory group policies. In August 2021, LockBit 2.0
began to advertise for insiders to establish initial access into potential victim networks, while
promising a portion of the proceeds from a successful attack. LockBit 2.0 also developed a
Linux-based malware which takes advantage of vulnerabilities within VMWare ESXi virtual
machines.

Technical Details
LockBit 2.0 is best described as a heavily obfuscated ransomware application leveraging bitwise
operations to decode strings and load required modules to evade detection. Upon launch,
LockBit 2.0 decodes the necessary strings and code to import the required modules followed by
determining if the process has administrative privileges. If privileges are not sufficient, it
attempts to escalate to the required privileges. Lockbit 2.0 then determines the system and
user language settings and only targets those not matching a set list of languages that are
Eastern European. If an Eastern European language is detected, the program exits without
infection. As infection begins, Lockbit 2.0 deletes log files and shadow copies residing on disk.
Lockbit 2.0 enumerates system information to include hostname, host configuration, domain
information, local drive configuration, remote shares, and mounted external storage devices.
Lockbit 2.0 attempts to encrypt any data saved to any local or remote device but skips files
associated with core system functions. Once completed, Lockbit 2.0 deletes itself from disk and
creates persistence at startup.
Prior to encryption, Lockbit affiliates primarily use the Stealbit application obtained directly
from the Lockbit panel to exfiltrate specific file types. The desired file types can be configured
by the affiliate to tailor the attack to the victim. The affiliate configures the application to target
a desired file path and, upon execution, the tool copies the files to an attacker-controlled server
using http. Due to the nature of the affiliate model, some attackers use other commercially
available tools such as rclone and MEGAsync to achieve the same results. Lockbit 2.0 actors
often use publicly available file sharing services including, privatlab[.]net, anonfiles[.]com,
sendspace[.]com, fex[.]net, transfer[.]sh, and send.exploit[.]in. While some of these
applications and services can support legitimate purposes, they can also be used by threat
actors to aid in system compromise or exploration of an enterprise.

Information Requested:
The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing
communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with
the threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, the decryptor file, and/or a benign sample of an
encrypted file. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files
will be recovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,
encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit
activities. However, the FBI understands that when victims are faced with an inability to
function, all options are evaluated to protect shareholders, employees and customers.
Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges
you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local field office and/or file a complaint
on www.ic3.gov. Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future

attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under
US law.

Recommended Mitigations:
FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of
compromise by LockBit 2.0 ransomware:









Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be
reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have
access. Note: Devices with local administrative accounts should implement a password
policy that requires strong, unique passwords for each individual administrative
account.
Require multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly
for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.
Keep all operating systems and software up to date. Prioritize patching known
exploited vulnerabilities. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective
steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats.
Remove unnecessary access to administrative shares, especially ADMIN$ and C$. If
ADMIN$ and C$ are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to only the
necessary service or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for anomalous
activity.
Use a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via server
message block (SMB) from a limited set of administrator machines.
Enable protected files in the Windows Operating System to prevent unauthorized
changes to critical files.

Adversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility and
mapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment, limit
common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions:




Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can
help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and
access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral
movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are
particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common
and uncommon network connections for each host.

TLP:WHITE









Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed
and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust
model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically
disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. When
the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through an automated
process that enables access to a system, but only for a set timeframe to support task
completion.
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If
threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating
privileges and/or moving laterally.
Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This
practice will ensure the organization will not be severely interrupted, have irretrievable
data.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted) and
covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.

Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the Government’s
official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.
CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered
set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and
recover from a ransomware incident.
CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations
assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By requesting
these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack
vectors.
