Victim profiling

BTSDoor

BlackTech sends
an email to the
target, spoofing
the address of a
legitimate
company.

The Excel file is
protected with a
password, and
asks the user to
“Enable content” to
view the page.

Macros
concatenate a
decimal-encoded
array and decode
it to a PE payload,
then drop it in the
Startup folder.

The downloader
can perform C2
via the
IWebBrowser2
interface and
execute basic
commands.

BlackTech can
issue commands,
such as whoami,
to Flagpro
implants to profile
the infected
victim.

If the victim is of
interest to the
threat actor,
Flagpro can
download and
execute a
backdoor.

BlackTech’s targeting
Targeted sectors

BlackTech focus

Strategic outlook

BlackTech is a China-based,
espionage-motivated threat actor.

China’s 13th FYP focused on reducing
reliance on imports and on boosting
domestic industry, with special
attention to innovation and R&D.

Some of it main aims include:
Technology

Semiconductors

Electronics

●
●

Government

Engineering /
Construction

Back to Black(Tech)
PwC

Financial services

Manufacturing

Media

Professional /
Managed services

●

stealing intellectual property
and proprietary technologies;
gathering information about the
activities of companies of
interest;
compromising governments
(including the Taiwanese one)
and entities relevant to Chinese
strategic objectives.

Targeting has concentrated on Taiwan,
occasionally Japan and Hong Kong,
but also includes China and the US.

14th FYP continues the push for
increasing technological as well as
industrial independence.
Focus is on addressing supply chain
vulnerabilities and chokepoints,
notably:
●
●

semiconductors and
integrated circuits.

All eyes are on Taiwan as a crucial
supplier of semiconductors, as well as
on Japanese manufacturing.

Open directory contained:
○ Consock, attributed firmly to
BlackTech due to ties to previous
infrastructure
○ Flagpro (substantiating the link)

●

Targeting of Chinese subsidiaries of
Japanese companies, MSPs
