In this document we report on our analysis of
CosmicDuke - the first malware seen to include
code from both the notorious MiniDuke APT trojan
and another longstanding threat, the informationstealing Cosmu family. When active on an infected
machine, CosmicDuke will search for and harvest
login details from a range of programs and forward
the data to remote servers, some of which were
active at the time of writing.

INTRODUCTION
In early 2013, the MiniDuke malware was discovered in
use in a series of attacks against NATO and European
government agencies. While investigating MiniDuke
loaders in April 2014, we were surprised to notice that the
malicious executable being decompressed and loaded
into memory was very similar to the Cosmu family of
information-stealers, which we saw as long ago as 2001.
Cosmu is the first malware family we have seen to share
code with MiniDuke.
This analysis is focused on those Cosmu samples that
share code with MiniDuke. Some of these are older than
the oldest publicly documented MiniDuke samples,
implying that the shared code might have been originally
used by Cosmu, not MiniDuke. For convenience, we
decided to name the samples showing this amalgamation
of MiniDuke-derived loader and Cosmu-derived payload
CosmicDuke.
The filenames and content used in CosmicDuke’s
attack files to lure victims into opening them contain
references to the countries of Ukraine, Poland, Turkey
and Russia,either generally in use of language or included
detail, or in allusions to events or institutions. The
filenames and content chosen seem to be tailored to their
target’s interests, though at the time of writing, we have
no further information on the identity or location of these
victims.
CosmicDuke infections start by tricking victims into
opening either a PDF file that contains an exploit or a
Windows executable whose filename is manipulated to
make it look like a document or image file.
Once the victim opens the file, the malware gains
persistence on the system and starts collecting
information. The data collection components include a
keylogger, clipboard stealer, screenshotter, and password
stealers for a variety of popular chat, email and web

browsing programs. It also collects information about
the files on the system, and has the capability to export
cryptographic certificates and the associated private keys.
Once the information has been collected, it is sent out to
remote servers via FTP. In addition to stealing information
from the system, Cosmu allows the attacker to download
and execute other malware on the system.
F-Secure has detections for all the different malicious
components used by the Cosmu variants described in this
report.

SCOPE
We have seen dozens of Cosmu samples that share code
with MiniDuke. Rather than cover the entire spectrum
of samples, the scope of this analysis was intentionally
limited to highlighting the most interesting of the
recent samples. This includes examining the attack files
used to infect targets, the remote servers storing data
collected from the victims and the differences between
the MiniDuke loaders and Cosmu info-stealers used in the
samples.

TARGET
This analysis is based on examination of files we gathered
through our sample collection systems. Based on the
nature of the filenames and decoy documents used, and
the fact that the MiniDuke loader is known to be used as a
part of targeted attacks, we suspect that CosmicDuke may
also be used in such operations. At the time of writing,
we have not identified any victims ourselves, nor are we
aware of any public reports confirming this scenario.

ARRIVAL

DATA THEFT

At this time, we have no information on how the
CosmicDuke attack files are delivered to the victims,
though based on the findings from the analysis, we can
make an educated guess.

CosmicDuke’s primary purpose is to steal information. The
different ways it collects information from the infected
machine are as follows:

It is possible that the PDF documents containing exploits
were emailed to the targeted users as file attachments.
Assuming that the email gateway used by the victims does
not include an antivirus solution capable of identifying the
exploit, such files would have little impediment to being
spread by email.

yy Keylogger
yy Taking screenshots
yy Stealing data from clipboard
yy Stealing files
yy Stealing PKI certificates and associated private keys

It is however unlikely that the samples which camouflaged
the executable files as image or document files would
be distributed in the same way. Regardless of any tricks
played with the filenames, the files themselves are
Windows executables, and many email solutions today
prevent users from opening attached executable files.

yy Stealing usernames and passwords from browsers,
instant messengers and email clients

INFECTION

DATA TRANSMISSION

The attackers are using at least two different methods for
infecting the systems: exploits and social engineering.

The information collected by the malware is automatically
uploaded to remote servers via FTP. Our analysis also
reveals various details of the remote sites contacted by
CosmicDuke, including the login credentials used and the
FTP folder structure.

DOCUMENT-BASED EXPLOIT
CosmicDuke malware samples that use exploits to gain
entry onto a target system (referred to as exploit files
in the rest of this document) start with a malicious
Flash object embedded into a PDF file. When the file is
launched, the object exploits the known CVE-2011-0611
vulnerability in specific versions of Adobe Flash, Reader
and Acrobat products.
Unlike the CosmicDuke files geared towards social
engineering, the exploit files do not actually display
any documents to the user as a form of distraction; the
malware simply straightaway exploits the vulnerability.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Less technically challenging CosmicDuke samples use
simple social engineering to trick the user into willingly
launching the attack file. Once launched, the file drops
the malware onto the system (such files are therefore
referred to as droppers in the rest of this documents).
To do so, the malware’s executable file is first disguised as
an image or document to make it seem innocuous. When
launched, a document or image is displayed in order to
draw the user’s attention away from any background
activity. In the meantime, the malware’s malicious files are
silently installed and executed on the system.

yy Stealing WLAN passwords
yy Stealing Windows password hashes

At the time of writing, most of these remote sites are live.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
CosmicDuke samples can be divided into 3 distinct groups
based on similarities between the C&C servers they
contact, file characteristics and decoy document used.
The full details of how the samples were grouped is listed
on page 11; Figure 2 at left provides a quick summary of the
grouping as they relate to how CosmicDuke is delivered,
and the decoy documents shown.
The first group of samples (Group #1) is spread using 3
dropper files that display specific decoy documents. The
second sample group (Group #2) uses both exploit-loaded
files and dropper files. The third group (Group #3) is rather
an exception, as it does not use the droppers or exploits
listed here; for the sake of simplicity, we will exclude
considering Group #3’s delivery method.

Image 1: Screenshot of folder containing CosmicDuke dropper files

DROPPER: RLO
CosmicDuke’s author(s) disguised the fact that the
malware is an executable file by using the Right-to-Left
Override (RLO) feature in Windows to hide the file’s
correct file extension, .exe or .scr, and replace it with .jpg,
.pdf or .doc, in order to make the file appear to be an
innocuous document or image.
Image 1 is a screenshot of how the filenames look like in
Windows 7. The real file extension for the top four files is
.scr, while the real extension for the bottom one is .exe.
Note that the attacker has also carefully changed the icon
of the executable to reflect the fake filetype for the first
four.
The bottom file is a curious exception, as it does not use a
PDF icon as would be expected with a .pdf file extension;
instead, it uses an NVIDIA icon, most likely to reflect the
fact that the product name of the executable is listed
as “NVIDIA Update Components” in the file’s version
information. This seems to be a common fake product
name used in the latest Cosmu samples. Meanwhile, the

filename readily visible to the users is translated from
Turkish as “civilian crisis center status report”.
The use of RLO is a smart move from the attackers. Why
go through the trouble of exploiting anything if you can
simply trick the user into double-clicking an executable
that looks a lot like a document file?
As the screenshot demonstrates, unchecking “Hide
extensions for known filetypes” does not help. The threeletter file extensions seen at the end of the filename is not
the real file extension. Even though the information in the
Type column is correct, most of the users probably do not
even check it.

DROPPER: DECOYS

Image 2: Decoy shown
by rcs.Заказ.doc

CosmicDuke dropper files all display some kind of a decoy
document or image to distract the user when the attack
file is launched.
The following are the droppers used by Group #1. Here are
the filenames of the decoys, as displayed in Windows, and
the decoy images or files they show when launched:

yy rcs.18.jpg 			
yy rcs.DSC_1365527283.jpg

- Image 2
- Image 3
- Image 4

The decoys are interesting. Заказ means “order” in
Russian. Based on the characters СЖС-1295 and ГХРП
found in the decoy, the document looks like an order for
growth hormones. The document contains full delivery
address, including the name of the person placing the
order.
An interesting detail about the image file of a receipt
(Image 3) shown by rcs.18.jpg is that it contains EXIF
metadata, including the date when the photo was taken
and the model of the mobile phone that was used to take
the photo. Part of this EXIF metadata is shown in Image 3a.

Image 3:
Decoy shown
by rcs.18.jpg

The third dropper file we’ve seen uses the filename ‘rcs.
Ukraine-Gas-Pipelines-Security-Report-March-2014.pdf’,
and displays the decoy document shown in Image 6. This
particular dropper file is notable in that its info-stealer
(SHA1:f513b21738ae3083d79e4fa1039889e1c3efff58) is the
same one used by the exploit file named “Bulletin-PISMNo-31-(625)-March-10-2014.pdf”.

the latter presumably refers to the Polish Institute of
International Affairs [1].

LOADER: MINIDUKE 3RD STAGE
The CosmicDuke samples we analyzed used the same
loader as MiniDuke’s stage 3 [2] samples, making this the
first occasion in which we’ve seen other malware using
this particular loader.
The parallel usage of the loader in the CosmicDuke and
MiniDuke families is interesting. The oldest samples we
have of this loader that loads Cosmu malware show the
compilation date of the loader as March 24 2011, which
predates the oldest publicly documented MiniDuke
sample (with a recorded loader compilation date of
June 18 2012). The earlier use of the loader with a Cosmu
payload leads us to suspect the existence of a link
between the author(s) of Cosmu and MiniDuke.
The most common compilation date seen for the loaders
that load the Cosmu malware is November 13 2012.
Perhaps coincidentally, we found one MiniDuke sample
(originally reported by CrySys [3]) that also shows the same
compilation date. In this case however, the MiniDuke
component is actually a downloader; it connects to an
IP address in Turkey, and when it receives a response,
decrypts and executes it.
Also of interest is that once the MiniDuke loader was
updated, we saw CosmicDuke samples take the updated
loader into use in mid-April 1 2014, a few months after
MiniDuke started using the latest loader in mid-December
2013. It seems possible that the actors behind the two
malware families share code and/or tools.

MAIN COMPONENT: INFO-STEALER

PASSWORD STEALING

The Cosmu info-stealer is the main component of the
CosmicDuke malware. The technical description of the
info-stealer is based on analysis of the following sample:

The malware targets the following software:

SHA1: b072577447cdf3936d95e612057e510dd3435963.

PERSISTENCE
Cosmu has a couple of different mechanisms for achieving
persistence on the system. It creates a scheduled task and
installs a Windows service.
The scheduled task is typically named “Watchmon
Service”. It executes the malware at system startup.
The service typically has name javamtsup, and the display
name is ”Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service”. The
size of the service binary on disk varies, but typically the
real size is 5120 bytes (based on PE headers) and the SHA1
value is 7803f160af428bcfb4b9ea2aba07886f232cde4e.
The service itself is very straightforward: it opens a handle
to explorer.exe process, duplicates its process token,
reads the path of the actual malware binary from registry
(key HKLM\Software\JavaSoft, value Supplement) and
starts the malware using the duplicated process token.
Cosmu copies itself with a couple of different filenames
to %WINDIR%\system32. The binaries on the disk have a
variable length of zero-padding but they are all essentially
copies of the original malware binary.
The filenames for both the Cosmu copies and the service
binary are generated by randomly taking two items from
the following list and concatenating them, resulting in
filenames like usbmon.exe, urllsa.exe, and rasdns.exe:
yy nt
yy inf
yy svc
yy ras
yy pptp
yy obj
yy net
yy host

yy Instant messaging
 Skype
The malware steals Skype login MD5. The attacker
can obtain victim’s Skype username and password
by using a bruteforce or dictionary attack to crack
the MD5. The attack was publicly documented in
2006 [4].

yy dwengine.exe
yy MsMpEng.exe
yy msseces.exe
yy ekrn.exe
yy savservice.exe
yy scfservice.exe
yy savadminservice.exe

CERTIFICATE STEALING
Cosmu exports certificates and, if available, the
associated private keys from system store by calling
PFXExportCertStoreEx. The malware uses the password
“saribas” to encrypt the exported data.

TARGETED FILETYPES
Cosmu searches the hard drives and network drives for
files that match any of the below patterns:
yy *.doc
yy *.xps
yy *.xls
yy *.ppt
yy *.pps
yy *.wps
yy *.wpd
yy *.ods
yy *.odt
yy *.lwp
yy *.jtd

yy *.pdf
yy *.zip
yy *.rar
yy *.docx
yy *.url
yy *.xlsx
yy *.pptx
yy *.ppsx

yy *.ost
yy *psw*

yy *pass*
yy *login*
yy *admin*
yy *sifr*
yy *sifer*
yy *vpn
yy *.jpg
yy *.txt
yy *.lnk

SCREENSHOTTER
Cosmu takes screenshots periodically and sends them to
the attacker, together with other stolen data.

CLIPBOARD STEALER

Patterns *sifr* and *sifer* are interesting because they
clearly target non-English filenames, given that ‘sifr’ is the
Arabic word for zero (and interestingly enough, also the
base word for an encryption cipher in many languages).

Cosmu copies the content of the clipboard every 30
seconds and sends those to the attacker together with
other stolen data.

Cosmu searches removable drives for a broader set of files
– only files whose filename matches any of the following
patterns are skipped/ignored:

CONFIGURATION

yy *.exe
yy *.ndb
yy *.mp3
yy *.avi

yy HTTP server IPs and URL paths
yy FTP server IPs, usernames and passwords
yy WebDav IPs, usernames and passwords
yy Filename prefix and file extension for downloaded files
yy Filename prefix and file extension for exfiltrated data

An interesting detail is that Cosmu skips searching the
removable drive if the volume name is “trandescend”
(case insensitive comparison).

In all the configurations we have seen, the servers are
specified using IP addresses, not domain names.

The configuration can contain the following information:

The configuration is embedded into the info-stealer. It is
compressed using an algorithm similar to but simpler than
LZNT-1 [5].

NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS

FIGURE 5: PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
BUGGY RC4 ENCRYPTION

The sample makes HTTP GET requests to the server(s)
specified in the configuration. The GET request contains
the following fields in this order:
yy m or mgn
yy Auth
yy Session
yy DataID
yy FamilyID
yy BranchID
yy VolumeID
yy User
yy Query.
The first field, m or mgn, does not have any value.
The value of Auth is the ID of the sample. It is the same
8-character hex digit that can be found in the PDB path,
among other places.
The value of Query depends on the request. It is either
encoded using URL safe base64, or then the value is
a 1792-character string. That string is composed of a
256-character string that is repeated seven times.
The 256-character string is generated by selecting
characters randomly from the following 32-character
alphabet:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
The malware uses the FTP servers and WebDav servers
both for exfiltrating the collected data and for updating
the malware.
All servers used by the info-stealers listed in “Appendix A |
Samples” are listed in “Appendix B | Servers”.

RC4 ENCRYPTION
Cosmu uses RC4 to decrypt incoming data and encrypt
outgoing data. The RC4 routine is not standard RC4, but
instead of an intentional customization it seems that the
implementation is simply buggy. The mistake is illustrated
in Figure 5 that shows a Python re-implementation of the
buggy RC4.
All RC4 keys are 32 bytes. Here are the known keys:
yy pHG5AS4deKLil9ADdR2BcA1hTNm0FQz3
yy 3Pf4GxTaDnx50qWe2Xz62uSptFsR3g3P
yy AdjustKernelTableFromSSDTSpace2\x00
yy FB7V61C7509E4L99BDZ7F74A79A69CDF
Even though only the first 32 bytes are used as the RC4
key, the first two RC4 keys in the above list are followed by

an interesting string:
Atruefriendissomeonewhothinksthatyouareagoodegg
eventhoughheknowsthatyouareslightlycrackedgroove
“A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good
egg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked”
is a Bernard Meltzer quote.

SAMPLES COMPARISON
A comparison of the compilation times of the
samples, and of other similarities observed in the file
characteristics, reveals some interesting patterns. For
more details, see “Appendix A | Samples”.

LEGACY CREDENTIALS AND FTP FOLDER STRUCTURE
The oldest Cosmu samples we saw have a compilation
timestamp of 2001-09-25. Since it is possible for the
compilation timestamp to be manipulated, it may be that
the samples are not that old. We have however not seen
any samples that would give us reason to suspect that the
timestamp has been tampered with.
These old samples do not use the MiniDuke loader and
therefore are not discussed in detail in this analysis. They
do however show some characteristics that link them
to these fresh variants. For example, the credentials and
same FTP folder structure used by the old samples have
been used on another Cosmu FTP server that is still active.

COMPILATION TIMELINE

INFO-STEALER GROUPING

All droppers were compiled on 2013-08-02. The
majority of the loaders were compiled on 2012-1113, though one was compiled on 2012-12-04 - oddly
enough, the same day when one MiniDuke payload
reported by BitDefender [6] and Kaspersky [7], (md5:
6bc34809e44c40b61dd29e0a387ee682) was compiled.
This was a downloader that connects to an IP address in
Turkey. As the server is no longer up however, we were
unable to investigate it further.

The info-stealer samples we have analyzed can be also
be separated into three distinct groupings based on the
following attributes:

The compilation timestamps of the info-stealers show
more variation. The oldest variant loaded with the
MiniDuke loader was compiled on 2012-12-04. Most of the
info-stealers were compiled in February and March 2014.

yy The program database (PDB) path
yy Server address and credentials
yy The loader
yy Filenames and decoy content
Full list of the servers contacted by samples in these
groupings in available in Appendix B | Servers on page 15.
Group #1
All samples in this group have a PDB path on the
infected system’s C:\ drive that contains the directory
“botgenstudio”.

All samples in this group use the same RC4 key:
“FB7V61C7509E4L99BDZ7F74A79A69CDF”

Group #3
The most recent CosmicDuke samples all belong to this
group. Unlike Groups #1 and #2, no exploits or droppers
are known to be associated with Group #3 samples, and
the loader filenames do not use the RLO trick. As such, we
will not cover Group #3’s delivery method further.

The servers used by this group are exclusive to this group,
i.e., the other sample groups do not use any of the servers
group #1 uses. The IP address of the servers used by this
group of samples are in Luxembourg, Netherlands, and
Russia. See “Appendix B | Servers” for details.

Of more interest with Group #3 is that older samples
within this groupin show some differences from the
latest variants. A few older samples in Group #3 still use
the original MiniDuke loader, while most recent ones are
using the updated MiniDuke loader.

We have seen three different droppers for this sample
group. All droppers use the RLO trick.

Another difference is that unlike the older ones, the latest
samples use the following PDB path:

We have not found any exploits associated to this group of
samples.

yy D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\KSK\Generations\70BCDEA1\
bin\Bot.pdb.

Group #2

This is quite similar to Group #2, though it seems “SVA” has
been replaced by “KSK”.

All samples in this group have a PDB path that contains
directories named “NITRO” and “SVA”. The PDB path is
always on D:\ drive. Here are some examples:

All samples in Group #3 connect to an FTP server at IP
188.116.32.164 using the same username (“adair”) and
password. This is the only server that the samples with the
original MiniDuke loader use.

yy D:\production\nitro\sva\generations\809113dd\bin\
Bot.pdb
yy D:\SVA\NITRO\PRODUCTION\Generations\805B1D01\
bin\bot.pdb
yy D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\SVA\Generations\8052B6C0\
bin\Bot.pdb
yy D:\PRODUCTION\NITRO\SVA\Generations\80B8A0BA\
bin\bot.pdb

Meanwhile, the most recent sample in Group #3,
which uses the updated loader with t the SHA1 value
fecdba1d903a51499a3953b4df1d850fbd5438bd, also
connects to another server at IP address 178.21.172.157.
The updated loader has PDB path, C:\Projects\NEMESIS\
nemesis-gemina\nemesis\bin\carriers\ezlzma_x86_exe.
pdb.

All samples except one in this group use PDF files with
exploits as an infection vector. The sole exception is
sha1:98f81b03a3b0f7b0b914d783683817953e8d4cf0. It
does not use an exploit and it does not use a dropper;
instead the loader has a filename (Sivil Durum Raporu Kriz
Merk?fdp.izay.exe) that uses the same RLO trick used in
Group #1 samples.
Another interesting detail for this sample is the PDB path:
d:\sva\nitro\botgenstudio\interface\
generations\80ddfcc1\bin\Bot.pdb
Even though this contains both “SVA” and “NITRO”, it
also contains “botgenstudio”, again making it similar
to Group #1. One other sample in Group #2 (sha1:
fb3b8f6494b211386381a7e4f6524d3e4643c9e9) shows a
similar PDB path.
The servers used by this group are exclusive to this group,
i.e., the other sample groups do not use any of the servers
group #2 uses.
