SECURITY

By Splunk Threat Research Team May 03, 2021

Clop Ransomware has been active since 2019 and has been mostly associated with financially-driven
criminal groups. However, lately this ransomware payload has been observed in campaigns against
universities and other institutions in the education vertical. Most recently, Clop Ransomware has been
used in a cyberattack that demanded one of the highest ransom amounts in recorded history ($20
1/7

million), and one of the particular items associated with the actors behind the Clop Ransomware is
blackmailing their victims through threatening to publish sensitive information exfiltrated from victims’
networks. Within this past month in April, we saw that Clop Ransomware-related threats were
persistent throughout the distinct variants used by several groups of organized criminals and decided
to focus our research efforts on Clop Ransomware detections. We hope that these detections will help
organizations detect abnormal behavior faster before it becomes detrimental. Watch this video to learn
more.

Detection Searches for Clop Ransomware

2/7

As we state in our blog, "Detecting Clop Ransomware," the actors behind this crimeware send the
malicious payloads via different methods, such as phishing emails, then proceed to spread
ransomware payload post-exploitation by pivoting to exposed or related vulnerable systems. Although
the actual developers of this crimeware have not been identified yet, they have been tied to several
financially-driven threat actors. They are also known for leveraging public available vulnerabilities as
entry and post-exploitation vectors.
The most common method behind this crimeware is as follows: once they have infiltrated their targets,
they then present instructions on how to pay ransom and communicate further threats of exposure by
publishing the sensitive information they obtained on a publicly accessible website.

Although this may appear as a new modality, in reality ransomware is usually the cherry on top of the
cake, as malicious actors usually dwell, exfiltrate and qualify exfiltrated data, which eventually lands on
dark web public forums, dark markets or private crime intelligence brokers where qualified financial,
business and kompromat information is then priced and sold to the highest bidder.
We used our attack range tool to demonstrate and research how this malware payload infects and
spreads once executed. A number of new searches has been created to address this threat:

Please see our blog "Detecting Clop Ransomware" for specific information about the events and SPL
code involved in these detections. We also provide information about a Splunk Phantom playbook that
can be used to defend against this threat.

Why Should You Care?
Having the paid ransom amounts in recorded history ($20 million) and the fact that the Clop
Ransomware actors are extremely opportunistic makes this a specially worrisome actor. The actors
behind this crimeware are constantly looking for vulnerable targets, and once they are able to infiltrate
victims, they are driven by obtaining sensitive information which most likely will end up sold in a dark
market.
Ransomware campaigns involving this payload will continue, as this group continuously targets
different verticals it is important to prepare and understand the workings of these malicious payloads
and prepare your environment in order to defend and be resilient against a ransomware attack. You
can use our pre-packaged detections to help your organization stay safe against these types of
attacks.
