Updates:
May 14, 2021: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
updated this page based on public release of detailed eviction guidance for this activity:
AR21-134A: Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active
Directory/M365 Compromise and Supplemental Direction Version 4 to Emergency
Directive 21-01: Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise.
May 7, 2021: CISA Fact Sheet: Russian SVR Activities Related to SolarWinds
Compromise lists advisories on the SVR malicious activity.
April 15, 2021: Statement from the White House provides U.S. Government attribution
of this activity to the SVR.
Since December 2020, CISA has been responding to a significant cybersecurity incident
affecting networks of multiple U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and
private sector organizations, in which advanced persistent threat (APT) actors—identified on
April 15, 2020, as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) actors—gained long-term
access to organizations’ enterprise networks and moved laterally to Microsoft cloud systems,
i.e., Azure Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft 365 (M365) environments. The SVR actors
used privileged access to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data and created backdoors to
enable their return.
Note: although the guidance on this webpage is tailored to federal departments and
agencies, CISA encourages critical infrastructure and private sector organizations to review
and apply it, as appropriate. For more information on CISA’s response to this activity, refer to
cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise.

Russian SVR APT Actor Activity
Russian SVR APT Actor Activity
The SVR actors added malicious code to certain versions of the SolarWinds Orion platform
and leveraged it for initial access to select enterprise networks. Through incident response,
CISA determined that, in other instances, the SVR actors obtained initial access by
password guessing, password spraying, and exploiting inappropriately secured
administrative credentials via remote services.

1/11

In some instances, once inside the network, the SVR actors bypassed multi-factor
authentication (MFA) and moved laterally to Microsoft cloud systems by compromising
federated identity solutions. SVR actors:
Stole the Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) token-signing certificate to forge
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. This technique—referred to as
“Golden SAML”—enabled SVR actors to bypass the federated resource provider's MFA
and password requirements and thereby move laterally to M365 environments.
Modified or added trusted domains in Azure AD. This technique enabled SVR actors to
add new federated identity providers (iDPs) and thereby move laterally to Azure AD
environments. (See FireEye White Paper: Remediation and Hardening Strategies for
Microsoft 365 to Defend Against UNC2452.)
After gaining access to cloud environments, the SVR actors established persistence
mechanisms for Application Programming Interface (API)-based access and collected and
exfiltrated data.
The SVR actors have demonstrated sophisticated defense evasion skills. They:
Hid their command and control (C2) communications with extensive obfuscation,
Hid their activity among legitimate user traffic, and
Established difficult-to-detect persistence mechanisms (e.g., in API).
Note: for more information on this activity, including tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs), refer to CISA Alerts and joint publications:

Risk/Impact Assessment
Risk/Impact Assessment
Organizations that used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion should conduct a risk
assessment, if they have not already done so, to determine if their network was
compromised, and if applicable, the severity of compromise. As defined in CISA Activity Alert

2/11

AA20-352A:Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical
Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations, networks with SolarWinds Orion products
will fall into one of three categories.
Category 1 includes agency networks that do not have the identified malicious binary
code on their network and can forensically confirm that the binary was never present
on their systems. This includes networks that do not, and never did, use the affected
versions of SolarWinds Orion products.
Category 2 includes agency networks where the presence of the malicious binary has
been identified—with or without beaconing to avsvmcloud[.]com .
Category 3 includes agency networks that used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion
and have evidence of follow-on threat actor activity, such as binary beaconing to
avsvmcloud[.]com and secondary C2 activity to a separate domain or IP address
(typically but not exclusively returned in avsvmcloud[.]com Canonical Name record
[CNAME] responses).
Note: As described above, CISA is aware of other initial access vectors. Organizations
should not assume they are not compromised by this actor solely because they have never
used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion. Those organizations should investigate to
confirm they have not observed related threat actor TTPs.

Remediating Malicious Activity: Category 1 and 2 Organizations
Although unaffected by this incident, Category 1 organizations should work to maintain
strong network posture and resilience. Refer to https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity and
https://us-cert.cisa.gov/resources/federal for assistance. CISA recommends Category 1
organizations:
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. See Protecting Against Malicious
Code.
Ensure systems have the latest security updates. See Understanding Patches and
Software Updates.
Enforce a strong password policy. See Choosing and Protecting Passwords.
Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected
and the sender appears to be known. See Using Caution with Email Attachments.

CISA Emergency Directive (ED) 21-01: Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise
According to ED 21-01 and associated supplemental guidance, all federal agencies that ran
affected versions of SolarWinds Orion must “conduct system memory, host storage, network,
and cloud forensic analysis,” “hunt for indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other evidence of
threat actor activity, such as secondary actions on objectives (AOO),” and “[i]dentify and
remove all threat actor-controlled accounts and identified persistence mechanisms.”

Remediating Malicious Activity: Category 3 Organizations
Remediating Malicious Activity: Category 3 Organizations
Remediation plans for dealing with malicious compromises are necessarily unique to every
organization, and success requires careful consideration. To assist affected organizations in
crafting eviction plans, CISA has released AR21-134A: Eviction Guidance for Networks
Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise, which provides in-depth
steps and resources for eviction. The guidance has three phases:
Phase 1: Pre-Eviction. Actions to detect and identify APT activity and prepare the
network for eviction.
Phase 2: Eviction. Actions to remove the APT actor from on-premises and cloud
environments. This phase includes rebuilding devices and systems.
Phase 3: Post-Eviction. Actions to ensure eviction was successful and the network
has good cyber posture.
In accordance with ED-21-01: Supplemental Direction Version 4, agencies which had
or have affected versions of SolarWinds Orion and have evidence of follow-on threat
actor activity must execute and complete applicable eviction steps by July 16, 2021.

4/11

Completing all the steps provided in the eviction guidance is necessary to fully accomplish
eviction.
The eviction will be resource-intensive and highly complex, requiring the enterprise network
to be disconnected from the internet for 3–5 days; however, failure to perform a
comprehensive and thorough remediation will expose enterprise networks and cloud
environments to substantial risk of long-term undetected APT activity, including email
monitoring, data collection, and exfiltration. CISA recommends organization leadership read
the CISA Insights, Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active
Directory/M365 Compromise: Risk Decisions for Leaders, for more information.
