FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

An Estonian man was sentenced today to 66 months in prison for his years-long role in
furthering and facilitating computer intrusions, the movement of fraudulently obtained goods
and funds, and the monetization of stolen financial account information. He also participated
in ransomware attacks causing over $53 million in losses and was ordered to pay over $36
million in restitution.
According to court documents, Maksim Berezan, 37, of Estonia, who was apprehended in
Latvia and extradited to the United States, pleaded guilty in April 2021 to conspiracy to
commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and conspiracy to commit access device
fraud and computer intrusions. Berezan was an active member of an exclusive online forum
designed for Russian-speaking cybercriminals to gather safely and exchange their criminal
knowledge, tools, and services. From 2009 through 2015, Berezan not only furthered the
criminal aims of the forum, but he also worked closely with forum members and other
cybercriminals for purposes of obtaining and exploiting stolen financial account information.

“This case is a prime example of how the Department of Justice can leverage its traditional
tools – criminal investigations and prosecutions – to combat ransomware,” said Assistant
Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Many
of the world’s ransomware players began as fraudsters engaged in other types of online
crimes, and this case demonstrates that their crimes will catch up to them. The United States
is committed to working with its international partners to hold cybercriminals accountable.”
“Cybercrime has become increasingly more sophisticated, but so have our methods for
combatting it,” said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia.
“Ransomware attacks are devastating to people and organizations alike, and we have honed
our strategies and techniques to target both the individual actors who perpetrate these
attacks and the networks that support them. This case is just one example of how EDVA and
the Justice Department are tackling this threat.”
“The Secret Service remains committed to ensuring that modern conveniences of today that
facilitate our lawful transactions and economic health are not leveraged by criminals for illicit
activity and personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Stohler of the U.S. Secret
Service. “While we have long been in the business of protecting money, from the earliest
days of coins and paper, to plastic, and today’s more accessible and commonplace digital
currencies, we also remain in parallel footprint to the evolution of criminal behavior into
cyberspace. Ransomware thieves are not safe in any dark corner of the internet in which
they may think they can hide from our highly trained investigators and law enforcement
partners worldwide. Together with our critical partners we are dedicated to protecting the
public and securing every iteration of our money and every part of our national financial
infrastructure.”
According to court documents, following Berezan’s arrest, investigators uncovered within his
electronic devices evidence of his involvement in ransomware activities. The post-extradition
investigation determined that Berezan had participated in at least 13 ransomware attacks,
seven of which were against U.S. victims, and that approximately $11 million in ransom
payments flowed into cryptocurrency wallets that he controlled. Berezan used his ill-gotten
gains to purchase two Porsches, a Ducati motorcycle, and an assortment of jewelry. In
addition, authorities recovered from Berezan’s residence currency worth more than $200,000
and electronic devices storing passphrases to bitcoin wallets that contained bitcoin worth
approximately $1.7 million, which has been forfeited.

Service made the announcement.
