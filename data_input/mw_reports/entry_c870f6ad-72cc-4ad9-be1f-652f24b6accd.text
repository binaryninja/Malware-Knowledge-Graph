A new botnet is growing around the world, feeding off unsecured IoT devices, mainly IP
cameras, and getting ready to do some harm.
Discovered by security researchers from Bitdefender, the new botnet is called Hide 'N Seek
(HNS), and according to experts, the botnet first appeared on January 10, died off for a few
days, and came back strong over the weekend, on January 20.
In all this time, the botnet grew from an initial list of 12 compromised devices to over 14,000
bots, as of writing.

Not Mirai related
Unlike all the Internet of Things (IoT) botnets that have appeared in recent weeks, HNS is
not another modification of the Mirai IoT malware source code that was leaked online last
year.
In fact, according to Bogdan Botezatu, Bitdefender senior e-threat analyst, the HNS botnet
is more similar to Hajime rather than Mirai.

"It is the second known IoT botnet to date, after the notorious Hajime botnet, that has a
decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture," Botezatu says. "However, if in the case of Hajime,
the P2P functionality was based on the BitTorrent protocol, here we have a custom-built
P2P communication mechanism."
According to an analysis Botezatu authored today, each bot contains a list of IPs of other
infected bots, a list that can be updated in real-time, as the botnet grows and bots are lost
or gained.
HNS bots relay instructions and commands from one another, similar to the basics of the
P2P protocol. Botezatu says an HNS bot can receive and execute several types of
commands, such as "data exfiltration, code execution and interference with a device’s
operation."

No DDoS function (yet)
Surprisingly, Bitdefender experts did not find a DDoS function, meaning the botnet is
intended to be deployed as a proxy network, similar to how most IoT botnets have been
weaponized in the past year after DDoS functions drew too much attention and led to the
downfall of many aggressive botnets.
The botnet spreads via dictionary brute-force attacks against devices with open Telnet
ports. Just like its unique P2P bot management protocol, this spreading mechanism is also
heavily customized. Botezatu explains below:
The bot features a worm-like spreading mechanism that randomly generates a list of IP
addresses to get potential targets. It then initiates a raw socket SYN connection to each
host in the list and continues communication with those that answer the request on specific
destination ports (23 2323, 80, 8080). Once the connection has been established, the bot
looks for a specific banner (“buildroot login:”) presented by the victim. If it gets this login
banner, it attempts to log in with a set of predefined credentials. If that fails, the botnet
attempts a dictionary attack using a hardcoded list.
Once a session is established with a new victim, the sample will run through a “state
machine” to properly identify the target device and select the most suitable compromise
method. For example, if the victim has the same LAN as the bot, the bot sets up TFTP
server to allow the victim to download the sample from the bot. If the victim is located on the
internet, the bot will attempt a specific remote payload delivery method to get the victim to
download and run the malware sample. These exploitation techniques are preconfigured
and are located in a memory location that is digitally signed to prevent tampering. This list
can be updated remotely and propagated among infected hosts.
The good news is that just like all IoT malware, HNS cannot establish persistence on
infected devices, meaning the malware is automatically removed with every device reboot.

This makes managing the HNS botnet a 24-hour job, with the botnet needing constant
supervision from its creator in order to ensure the botnet continues to add new bots before
the old ones die off.

HNS still under development
In addition, because it's a new arrival on the IoT malware scene, HNS is also in a state of
constant change, as its operator(s) explores new spreading and bot management
techniques.
As many of these "new" botnets have had a tendency to disappear after a few weeks, let's
hope HNS' author gets bored and abandons his "experiment."
A 14K botnet is nothing to ignore. If we learned anything from the ProxyM botnet is that you
don't need tens of thousands of infected devices to run a profitable botnet. Four-five
thousands are enough.

14K bots in 2 weeks. Wow. I really hope he gets bored indeed.
