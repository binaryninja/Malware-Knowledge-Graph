Mitigations

1/21

Initial Access

T1078 – Valid
Accounts:

M1013 - Application
Developer Guidance:

Adversaries may
obtain and abuse
credentials of existing
accounts as a means
of gaining Initial
Access, Persistence,
Privilege Escalation, or
Defense Evasion.

Ensure that
applications do not
store sensitive data or
credentials insecurely.
(e.g. plaintext
credentials in code,
published credentials
in repositories, or
credentials in public
cloud storage).

M1027 - Password Policies:
Applications and appliances that utilize
default username and password should
be changed immediately after the
installation, and before deployment to a
production environment. When possible,
applications that use SSH keys should
be updated periodically and properly
secured.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Audit domain and local accounts as well
as their permission levels routinely to
look for situations that could allow an
adversary to gain wide access by
obtaining credentials of a privileged
account. These audits should also
include if default accounts have been
enabled, or if new local accounts are
created that have not be authorized.
Follow best practices for design and
administration of an enterprise network
to limit privileged account use across
administrative tiers.

2/21

M1017 - User Training:
Applications may send push
notifications to verify a login as a form of
multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train
users to only accept valid push
notifications and to report suspicious
push notifications.
T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing
Application:
Adversaries may attempt to take
advantage of a weakness in an Internetfacing computer or program using
software, data, or commands in order to
cause unintended or unanticipated
behavior. The weakness in the system
can be a bug, a glitch, or a design
vulnerability.

M1048 - Application
Isolation and
Sandboxing:
Application isolation
will limit what other
processes and system
features the exploited
target can access.

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Web Application Firewalls may be used
to limit exposure of applications to
prevent exploit traffic from reaching the
application.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Segment externally facing servers and
services from the rest of the network
with a DMZ or on separate hosting
infrastructure.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Use least privilege for service accounts
will limit what permissions the exploited
process gets on the rest of the system.
M1051 – Update Software:
Update software regularly by employing
patch management for externally
exposed applications.

3/21

M1016 – Vulnerability Scanning:
Regularly scan externally facing
systems for vulnerabilities and establish
procedures to rapidly patch systems
when critical vulnerabilities are
discovered through scanning and
through public disclosure.
T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing
Attachment:
Adversaries may send spearphishing
emails with a malicious attachment in an
attempt to gain access to victim
systems. Spearphishing attachment is a
specific variant of spearphishing.
Spearphishing attachment is different
from other forms of spearphishing in
that it employs the use of malware
attached to an email. All forms of
spearphishing are electronically
delivered social engineering targeted at
a specific individual, company, or
industry.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can also
automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion prevention systems
and systems designed to scan and
remove malicious email attachments
can be used to block activity.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based Content:
Block unknown or unused attachments
by default that should not be transmitted
over email as a best practice to prevent
some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif,
.cpl, etc. Some email scanning devices
can open and analyze compressed and
encrypted formats, such as zip and rar
that may be used to conceal malicious
attachments.

4/21

M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email
authentication mechanisms to filter
messages based on validity checks of
the sender domain (using SPF) and
integrity of messages (using DKIM).
Enabling these mechanisms within an
organization (through policies such as
DMARC) may enable recipients (intraorg and cross domain) to perform
similar message filtering and validation.
M1017 - User Training: Users can be
trained to identify social engineering
techniques and spearphishing emails.
T1566.002 – Phishing: Spearphishing
Link

M1021 - Restrict WebBased Content:
Determine if certain
websites that can be
used for spearphishing
are necessary for
business operations
and consider blocking
access if activity
cannot be monitored
well or if it poses a
significant risk.

M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email
authentication mechanisms to filter
messages based on validity checks of
the sender domain (using SPF) and
integrity of messages (using DKIM).
Enabling these mechanisms within an
organization (through policies such as
DMARC) may enable recipients (intraorg and cross domain) to perform
similar message filtering and validation.

5/21

M1017 - User Training:
Users can be trained to identify social
engineering techniques and
spearphishing emails with malicious
links.
Execution

T1106 – Native Application
Programming Interface (API)

T1059.003 – Windows
Command Shell:

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:

Adversaries may
abuse the Windows
command shell for
execution. The
Windows command
shell (cmd) is the
primary command
prompt on Windows
systems.

Use application
control where
appropriate.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10,
enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR) rules
to prevent Office VBA
macros from calling
Win32 APIs.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Identify and block potentially malicious
software executed that may be
executed through this technique by
using application control tools, like
Windows Defender Application Control,
AppLocker, or Software Restriction
Policies where appropriate.

6/21

T1047 – Windows Management
Instrumentation:
Adversaries may abuse Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) to
execute malicious commands and
payloads. WMI is an administration
feature that provides a uniform
environment to access Windows system
components.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10,
enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR) rules
to block processes
created by WMI
commands from
running. Note: many
legitimate tools and
applications utilize
WMI for command
execution.

M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control configured to
block execution of wmic.exe if it is not
required for a given system or network
to prevent potential misuse by
adversaries. For example, in Windows
10 and Windows Server 2016 and
above, Windows Defender Application
Control (WDAC) policy rules may be
applied to block the wmic.exe
application and to prevent abuse.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Prevent credential overlap across
systems of administrator and privileged
accounts.
M1018 - User Account Management:
By default, only administrators are
allowed to connect remotely using WMI.
Restrict other users who are allowed to
connect, or disallow all users to connect
remotely to WMI.

7/21

Persistence

T1078.002 – Valid
Accounts: Domain
Accounts:
Adversaries may
obtain and abuse
credentials of a
domain account as a
means of gaining
Initial Access,
Persistence, Privilege
Escalation, or Defense
Evasion. Domain
accounts are those
managed by Active
Directory Domain
Services where
access and
permissions are
configured across
systems and services
that are part of that
domain. Domain
accounts can cover
users, administrators,
and services.

M1032 - Multi-factor
Authentication:
Integrating multi-factor
authentication (MFA)
as part of
organizational policy
can greatly reduce the
risk of an adversary
gaining control of valid
credentials that may
be used for additional
tactics such as initial
access, lateral
movement, and
collecting information.
MFA can also be used
to restrict access to
cloud resources and
APIs.

M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Audit domain account permission levels
routinely to look for situations that could
allow an adversary to gain wide access
by obtaining credentials of a privileged
account. Do not put user or admin
domain accounts in the local
administrator groups across systems
unless they are tightly controlled and
use of accounts is segmented, as this is
often equivalent to having a local
administrator account with the same
password on all systems. Follow best
practices for design and administration
of an enterprise network to limit
privileged account use across
administrative tiers. Limit credential
overlap across systems to prevent
access if account credentials are
obtained.

8/21

M1017 - User Training:
Applications may send push
notifications to verify a login as a form of
multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train
users to only accept valid push
notifications and to report suspicious
push notifications.
T1133 – External Remote Services:
Adversaries may leverage externalfacing remote services to initially access
and/or persist within a network.

M1042 - Disable or
Remove Feature or
Program:
Disable or block
remotely available
services that may be
unnecessary.

M1035 - Limit Access to Resource Over
Network:
Limit access to remote services through
centrally managed concentrators such
as VPNs and other managed remote
access systems.
M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication:
Use strong two-factor or multi-factor
authentication for remote service
accounts to mitigate an adversary's
ability to leverage stolen credentials, but
be aware of Two-Factor Authentication
Interception techniques for some twofactor authentication implementations.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Deny direct remote access to internal
systems through the use of network
proxies, gateways, and firewalls.

9/21

Privilege Escalation

Defense Evasion

T1055.001 – Process
Injection: Dynamic-link
Library Injection:

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:

Adversaries may inject
dynamic-link libraries
(DLLs) into processes
in order to evade
process-based
defenses as well as
possibly elevate
privileges. DLL
injection is a method
of executing arbitrary
code in the address
space of a separate
live process.

Some endpoint
security solutions can
be configured to block
some types of
process injection
based on common
sequences of
behavior that occur
during the injection
process.

T1027 - Obfuscated
Files or Information:
Adversaries may
attempt to make an
executable or file
difficult to discover or
analyze by encrypting,
encoding, or otherwise
obfuscating its
contents on the
system or in transit.
This is common
behavior that can be
used across different
platforms and the
network to evade
defenses.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Consider utilizing the
Antimalware Scan
Interface (AMSI) on
Windows 10 to
analyze commands
after being
processed/interpreted.

M1040 - Behavior Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent
execution of potentially obfuscated
scripts.

10/21

T1055.001 – Process Injection:
Dynamic-link Library Injection:
Adversaries may inject dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) into processes in order
to evade process-based defenses as
well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL
injection is a method of executing
arbitrary code in the address space of a
separate live process.

T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or
Information:
Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files
or Information to hide artifacts of an
intrusion from analysis. They may
require separate mechanisms to decode
or deobfuscate that information
depending on how they intend to use it.
Methods for doing that include built-in
functionality of malware or by using
utilities present on the system.
Credential Access

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:
Some endpoint
security solutions can
be configured to block
some types of process
injection based on
common sequences of
behavior that occur
during the injection
process.
This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on the
abuse of system
features.

T1110 – Brute Force:
Adversaries may use
brute force techniques
to gain access to
accounts when
passwords are
unknown or when
password hashes are
obtained. Without
knowledge of the
password for an
account or set of
accounts, an
adversary may
systematically guess
the password using a
repetitive or iterative
mechanism.

M1036 - Account Use
Policies:
Set account lockout
policies after a certain
number of failed login
attempts to prevent
passwords from being
guessed. Too strict a
policy may create a
denial of service
condition and render
environments unusable, with all
accounts used in the
brute force being
locked-out.

11/21

M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication:
Use multi-factor authentication. Where
possible, also enable multi-factor
authentication on externally facing
services.
M1027 - Password Policies:
Refer to NIST guidelines when creating
password policies.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Proactively reset accounts that are
known to be part of breached
credentials either immediately, or after
detecting bruteforce attempts.
T1212 – Exploitation for Credential
Access:
Adversaries may exploit software
vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect
credentials. Exploitation of a software
vulnerability occurs when an adversary
takes advantage of a programming error
in a program, service, or within the
operating system software or kernel
itself to execute adversary-controlled
code. Credentialing and authentication
mechanisms may be targeted for
exploitation by adversaries as a means
to gain access to useful credentials or
circumvent the process to gain access
to systems.

M1048 - Application
Isolation and
Sandboxing:
Make it difficult for
adversaries to
advance their
operation through
exploitation of
undiscovered or
unpatched
vulnerabilities by using
sandboxing. Other
types of virtualization
and application
microsegmentation
may also mitigate the
impact of some types
of exploitation. Risks
of additional exploits
and weaknesses in
these systems may
still exist.

12/21

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Security applications that look for
behavior used during exploitation such
as Windows Defender Exploit Guard
(WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation
Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used
to mitigate some exploitation behavior.
Control flow integrity checking is
another way to potentially identify and
stop a software exploit from occurring.
Many of these protections depend on
the architecture and target application
binary for compatibility and may not
work for software targeted for defense
evasion.
M1019 - Threat Intelligence Program:
Develop a robust cyber threat
intelligence capability to determine what
types and levels of threat may use
software exploits and 0-days against a
particular organization.
M1051 - Update Software:
Update software regularly by employing
patch management for internal
enterprise endpoints and servers.
T1558.003 – Steal or Forge Kerberos
Tickets: Kerberoasting:

M1041 - Encrypt
Sensitive Information:

Adversaries may abuse a valid
Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or
sniff network traffic to obtain a ticketgranting service (TGS) ticket that may
be vulnerable to Brute Force.

Enable AES Kerberos
encryption (or another
stronger encryption
algorithm), rather than
RC4, where possible.

Service principal names (SPNs) are
used to uniquely identify each instance
of a Windows service. To enable
authentication, Kerberos requires that
SPNs be associated with at least one
service logon account (an account
specifically tasked with running a
service).

13/21

M1027 - Password Policies:
Ensure strong password length (ideally
25+ characters) and complexity for
service accounts and that these
passwords periodically expire. Also
consider using Group Managed Service
Accounts or another third party product
such as password vaulting.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Limit service accounts to minimal
required privileges, including
membership in privileged groups such
as Domain Administrators.
Discovery

T1016 – System
Network Configuration
Discovery:
Adversaries may look
for details about the
network configuration
and settings, such as
IP and/or MAC
addresses, of systems
they access or through
information discovery
of remote systems.
Several operating
system administration
utilities exist that can
be used to gather this
information. Examples
include Arp,
ipconfig/ifconfig,
nbtstat, and route.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

14/21

T1018 – Remote System Discovery:
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing
of other systems by IP address,
hostname, or other logical identifier on a
network that may be used for Lateral
Movement from the current system.
Functionality could exist within remote
access tools to enable this, but utilities
available on the operating system could
also be used such as Ping or net view
using Net. Adversaries may also use
local host files (ex:
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
or /etc/hosts) in order to discover the
hostname to IP address mappings of
remote systems.
T1046 – Network Service Scanning:
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing
of services running on remote hosts,
including those that may be vulnerable
to remote software exploitation.
Methods to acquire this information
include port scans and vulnerability
scans using tools that are brought onto
a system.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on the
abuse of system
features.

M1042 - Disable or
Remove Feature or
Program:
Ensure that
unnecessary ports and
services are closed to
prevent risk of
discovery and
potential exploitation.

M1031 - Network Intrusion Prevention:
Use network intrusion
detection/prevention systems to detect
and prevent remote service scans.
M1030 - Network Segmentation:
Ensure proper network segmentation is
followed to protect critical servers and
devices.

15/21

T1049 – System Network Connections
Discovery:
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing
of network connections to or from the
compromised system they are currently
accessing or from remote systems by
querying for information over the
network.
T1057 – Process Discovery:
Adversaries may attempt to get
information about running processes on
a system. Information obtained could be
used to gain an understanding of
common software/applications running
on systems within the network.
Adversaries may use the information
from Process Discovery during
automated discovery to shape follow-on
behaviors, including whether or not the
adversary fully infects the target and/or
attempts specific actions.
T1083 – File and Directory Discovery:
Adversaries may enumerate files and
directories or may search in specific
locations of a host or network share for
certain information within a file system.
Adversaries may use the information
from File and Directory Discovery during
automated discovery to shape follow-on
behaviors, including whether or not the
adversary fully infects the target and/or
attempts specific actions.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on the
abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on the
abuse of system
features.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on the
abuse of system
features.

16/21

T1135 – Network Share Discovery:
Adversaries may look for folders and
drives shared on remote systems as a
means of identifying sources of
information to gather as a precursor for
Collection and to identify potential
systems of interest for Lateral
Movement. Networks often contain
shared network drives and folders that
enable users to access file directories
on various systems across a network.
Lateral Movement

M1028 - Operating
System Configuration:
Enable Windows
Group Policy "Do Not
Allow Anonymous
Enumeration of SAM
Accounts and Shares"
security setting to limit
users who can
enumerate network
shares.
T1021.002 – Remote
Services:
SMB/Windows Admin
Shares:
Adversaries may use
Valid Accounts to
interact with a remote
network share using
Server Message Block
(SMB). The adversary
may then perform
actions as the loggedon user.

M1037 - Filter
Network Traffic:
Consider using the
host firewall to restrict
file sharing
communications such
as SMB.

SMB is a file, printer,
and serial port sharing
protocol for Windows
machines on the same
network or domain.
Adversaries may use
SMB to interact with
file shares, allowing
them to move laterally
throughout a network.
Linux and macOS
implementations of
SMB typically use
Samba.
M1035 - Limit Access to Resource Over
Network:
Consider disabling Windows
administrative shares.

17/21

M1027 - Password Policies:
Do not reuse local administrator account
passwords across systems. Ensure
password complexity and uniqueness
such that the passwords cannot be
cracked or guessed.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Deny remote use of local admin
credentials to log into systems. Do not
allow domain user accounts to be in the
local Administrators group multiple
systems.
T1080 – Taint Shared Content:
Adversaries may deliver payloads to
remote systems by adding content to
shared storage locations, such as
network drives or internal code
repositories. Content stored on network
drives or in other shared locations may
be tainted by adding malicious
programs, scripts, or exploit code to
otherwise valid files. Once a user opens
the shared tainted content, the
malicious portion can be executed to
run the adversary's code on a remote
system. Adversaries may use tainted
shared content to move laterally.

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:
Identify potentially
malicious software that
may be used to taint
content or may result
from it and audit
and/or block the
unknown programs by
using application
control [14] tools, like
AppLocker, or
Software Restriction
Policies where
appropriate.

M1050 - Exploit Protection:
Use utilities that detect or mitigate
common features used in exploitation,
such as the Microsoft Enhanced
Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).
M1022 - Restrict File and Directory
Permissions:
Protect shared folders by minimizing
users who have write access.

18/21

Exfiltration

T1567.002 –
Exfiltration Over Web
Service: Exfiltration to
Cloud Storage:
Adversaries may
exfiltrate data to a
cloud storage service
rather than over their
primary command and
control channel. Cloud
storage services allow
for the storage, edit,
and retrieval of data
from a remote cloud
storage server over
the Internet.

Impact

T1486 - Data
Encrypted for Impact:
Adversaries may
encrypt data on target
systems or on large
numbers of systems in
a network to interrupt
availability to system
and network
resources. They can
attempt to render
stored data
inaccessible by
encrypting files or data
on local and remote
drives and withholding
access to a decryption
key.

M1021 - Restrict WebBased Content:
Web proxies can be
used to enforce an
external network
communication policy
that prevents use of
unauthorized external
services.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint: On
Windows 10, enable
cloud-delivered
protection and Attack
Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
the execution of files
that resemble
ransomware.

19/21

M1053 - Data Backup: Consider
implementing IT disaster recovery plans
that contain procedures for regularly
taking and testing data backups that can
be used to restore organizational data.
Ensure backups are stored off system
and is protected from common methods
adversaries may use to gain access and
destroy the backups to prevent
recovery. Consider enabling versioning
in cloud environments to maintain
backup copies of storage objects.
T1490 - Inhabit System Recovery:
Adversaries may delete or remove builtin operating system data and turn off
services designed to aid in the recovery
of a corrupted system to prevent
recovery. Operating systems may
contain features that can help fix
corrupted systems, such as a backup
catalog, volume shadow copies, and
automatic repair features. Adversaries
may disable or delete system recovery
features to augment the effects of Data
Destruction and Data Encrypted for
Impact.

M1053 - Data Backup:
Consider
implementing IT
disaster recovery
plans that contain
procedures for taking
regular data backups
that can be used to
restore organizational
data. Ensure backups
are stored off system
and is protected from
common methods
adversaries may use
to gain access and
destroy the backups to
prevent recovery.

M1028 - Operating System
Configuration: Consider technical
controls to prevent the disabling of
services or deletion of files involved in
system recovery.

20/21

T1489 - Service Stop:
Adversaries may stop or disable
services on a system to render those
services unavailable to legitimate users.
Stopping critical services or processes
can inhibit or stop response to an
incident or aid in the adversary's overall
objectives to cause damage to the
environment.

M1030 - Network
Segmentation:
Operate intrusion
detection, analysis,
and response systems
on a separate network
from the production
environment to lessen
the chances that an
adversary can see and
interfere with critical
response functions.

M1022 - Restrict File and Directory
Permissions: Ensure proper process
and file permissions are in place to
inhibit adversaries from disabling or
interfering with critical services.
M1024 - Restrict Registry Permissions:
Ensure proper registry permissions are
in place to inhibit adversaries from
disabling or interfering with critical
services.
M1018 - User Account Management:
Limit privileges of user accounts and
groups so that only authorized
administrators can interact with service
changes and service configurations.
