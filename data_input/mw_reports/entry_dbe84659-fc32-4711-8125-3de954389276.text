In late 2020, the operators behind Maze ransomware, one of the more notorious
ransomware families in recent memory, announced that they were shutting down operations.
However, in just a short period after Maze’s retirement, the ransomware known as Egregor
has stepped in to fill the void, allegedly becoming the ransomware of choice for previous
Maze affiliates. Like Maze, Egregor makes use of a “double extortion” technique where the
ransomware operators threaten the victim not only with the loss of their data, but with a
warning that their data will go public if they fail to pay the ransom.

What is Egregor?
A sophisticated piece of ransomware that first surfaced around September 2020, Egregor
has since been involved in a number of high-profile attacks in a short period, including
attacks that were launched against major retailers and other organizations.
This ransomware is often distributed as a payload along with remote access trojans (RATs)
such as QAKBOT. In turn, QAKBOT has been previously observed to be connected with the
MegaCortex and ProLock ransomware families, which indicates either a possible partnership
between QAKBOT and Egregor or a new payload from the QAKBOT threat actors.
Similar to the double extortion technique used by the new breed of ransomware families
such as Ryuk, Egregor pressures the victim to pay by threatening to release stolen
information. In addition to encrypting data, operators behind Egregor also make threats
about informing mass media — and hence, the public — that the company has been
compromised.

On the surface, Egregor seems like a copy of the Sekhmet ransomware, as it shares most of
its codes and routines, most notable of which are its obfuscation techniques, functions, as
well as API calls and strings. Furthermore, like Sekhmet, it also appends a random extension
per file. However, it is possible that Egregor and Sekhmet are operated by entirely different
groups given the differences between the data leak sites that are used by the two.
Although there is no concrete information on how exactly Egregor gains initial access, it is
likely that it uses techniques that are similar with other targeted ransomware such as RDP
hacks, compromised websites, or stolen accounts.
One of Egregor’s defining characteristics is its use of advanced obfuscation techniques,
wherein it requires a specific argument to decrypt the payload, thereby making it difficult to
perform static or dynamic analysis on the ransomware variant without this argument.
According to the Egregor ransom note, victims that manage to pay the ransom will not only
have their data decrypted. In fact, the threat actors also offer to provide recommendations for
securing the company's network.

From our Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network ™ data, Egregor has been active
primarily in the US, with Japan and the UK also seeing a number of infections.

What are the recent incidents involving Egregor?
A number of Egregor’s attacks have occurred against high profile targets, including a leading
bookstore in October and a major retailer in December. In the former, the ransomware
operators behind Egregor claimed to have gathered unencrypted financial and auditing data,
although the precise nature of the data that was stolen is unclear.
Egregor has also been observed printing ransom notes. Based on our analysis, printing
ransom notes was not intentional on the operators’ end. Rather, it occurred as part of the
ransomware’s encryption routine, which enumerates any type of network resources ‫—ؙ‬
including printer resources. It then connects to the network resource to encrypt files and drop
the ransom note. It’s also possible that the printers and point-of-sale (POS) machines were
connected to the infected machines, which resulted in the ransom notes being physically
printed.
Other recent victims of Egregor include major organizations in both the gaming and human
resources industries.
How can the impact of Egregor and other ransomware be minimized?
Although there is still no concrete evidence on how Egregor gains initial access to the
system, other ransomware variants such as Maze are known to exploit vulnerabilities as part
of their routine. Therefore, it is important for organizations to patch and update their systems’
software to address any exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, businesses are encouraged
to keep their machines and their systems updated to prevent this from happening.
Businesses should also perform regular security audits of their systems to ensure that they
are as secure as possible. Company data should also be periodically backed up whenever
possible, preferably by adhering to the 3-2-1 rule, which involves keeping three copies in two
different formats with at least one copy off-site.

Meanwhile, employees should be given proper training on the best practices for
cybersecurity, especially when it comes to the common initial access techniques used by
ransomware, such as email-based attacks and compromised websites.
For a more robust and proactive line of defense against ransomware, we recommend the
following Trend Micro solutions:
Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites applies AI and analytics for earlier detection of
threats across endpoints and other layers of the system.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector detects, blocks, and analyzes malicious
email attachments through custom sandboxing and other detection techniques.
