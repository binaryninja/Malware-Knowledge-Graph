Breaking: Elite Cybercrime Forum “Maza” Breached by Unknown
Attacker
On March 3, 2021, Flashpoint detected a breach of the elite Russian cybercrime forum
known as “Maza” (originally called “Mazafaka”). This breach follows recent attacks (both
attempted and successful) on other Russian cybercrime forums, including the takeover of
Russian-language forum Verified.

“Maza” the Latest Russian Cybercrime Forum to Suffer a Breach
On March 3, 2021, Flashpoint detected a breach of the elite Russian cybercrime forum
known as “Maza” (originally called “Mazafaka”). This breach follows recent attacks (both
attempted and successful) on other Russian cybercrime forums, including the takeover of
Russian-language forum Verified.
Known to be in operations as far back as 2003, Maza is a highly-restricted Russian-language
cybercrime that built its notoriety over many years, cultivating a community of some of the
1/4

most sophisticated cybercriminals and financial fraudsters in the criminal underground—
many of whom began their respective cybercrime activities as early as the mid- to late1990s. Little is known at this time about the attackers who successfully compromised Maza.
After their successful takeover of Maza, the unknown attackers posted a warning message to
forum members reading: “Your data has been leaked” and “This forum has been hacked.”

Initial Assessment Suggests Breach is Major in Scale
Flashpoint analysts note that the Russian sentences on the warning page were likely
translated using an online translator. It is unclear if this automated translation indicates a
non-Russian speaking actor is responsible or if this service was used as a misdirection
technique.

Details Remain Obfuscated, but Scope of Attack Clearly Large
Flashpoint analysts successfully obtained the purported leaked data. While the compromised
data appears to be extensive, it’s worth noting that the passwords have been hashed and
most other data fields included in the dump have been hashed or further obfuscated. The
leaked Maza data includes the following:
User id
Username
email
Password (hashed and obfuscated)
Crt_filename
Crt_pass
Icq (when available)
Aim (when available)
Yahoo (when available)
Msn (when available)
Skype (when available)

Distressed Cybercriminals Deliberate Options and Exit Strategies
Flashpoint is actively monitoring cybercriminal discussions of Maza across the entire
cybercriminal forum ecosystem commenting on the recent disruptions to many elite services
and communities. Users on the Exploit forum are discussing moving away from using emails
to register on forums as recent disruption efforts may have increased exposure of their online
activities. Others are claiming that the database leaked by the attackers is either old or
incomplete.

Recent Uptick in Attacks on Russian Cybercrime Forums of Particular
Concern to Cybercriminals
Exploit actors also note an increase in attacks over the past months (attempted DDoS of
Exploit, Verified compromise, and now Maza), and think the attackers could potentially be
forum insiders or law enforcement. Finally, Exploit users note that if the attackers were law

enforcement, that this is a new tactic to shut down cybercriminal activity and degrade trust
across forums. A user on Exploit warned other users to be careful with registered emails
across multiple platforms.

Maza Attackers May Take Similar Approach to Verified Ownership
Change
News of the Maza attack comes directly on the heels of another successful breach of the
well-established Russian forum Verified on January 20, 2021. Less than a month later on
February 18, 2021, the new Verified admins announced the permanent change in ownership
and began the deanonymization process of Verified’s previous operators, known as “INC,”
“VR_Support,” and “TechAdmin”. The new admins noted that the previous administration
recorded the IP addresses of every Verified user upon their entrance, which resulted in the
collection of a total of 3,801,697 IP addresses.
Whether or not the Maza attackers will pursue a similar ownership takeover remains unclear.
Quite interestingly, however, the aforementioned INC admin is (or was) also a Maza
moderator.

Forum Breaches Are Not Strong Indicators of Permanent Shutdowns
Maza was previously hacked on February 18, 2011, compromising the data of more than
2,000 cybercriminal users, along with all of their forum correspondence. Shortly following this
2011 Maza breach, another attack was carried out against the Russian cybercrime forum,
DirectConnection, whose administrator was the famous “k0pa,” Aleksei Burkov.
