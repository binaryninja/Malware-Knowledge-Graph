Systems Affected
Microsoft Windows

Overview
“Avalanche” refers to a large global network hosting infrastructure used by cyber criminals to
conduct phishing and malware distribution campaigns and money mule schemes. The United
States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), is releasing this Technical Alert to provide further information about
Avalanche.

Description
Cyber criminals utilized Avalanche botnet infrastructure to host and distribute a variety of
malware variants to victims, including the targeting of over 40 major financial institutions.
Victims may have had their sensitive personal information stolen (e.g., user account
credentials). Victims’ compromised systems may also have been used to conduct other
malicious activity, such as launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or distributing malware
variants to other victims’ computers.
In addition, Avalanche infrastructure was used to run money mule schemes where criminals
recruited people to commit fraud involving transporting and laundering stolen money or
merchandise.
Avalanche used fast-flux DNS, a technique to hide the criminal servers, behind a constantly
changing network of compromised systems acting as proxies.
The following malware families were hosted on the infrastructure:
Windows-encryption Trojan horse (WVT) (aka Matsnu, Injector,Rannoh,Ransomlock.P)
URLzone (aka Bebloh)
Citadel
VM-ZeuS (aka KINS)
Bugat (aka Feodo, Geodo, Cridex, Dridex, Emotet)
newGOZ (aka GameOverZeuS)
Tinba (aka TinyBanker)
Nymaim/GozNym
Vawtrak (aka Neverquest)

Avalanche was also used as a fast flux botnet which provides communication infrastructure
for other botnets, including the following:
TeslaCrypt
Nymaim
Corebot
GetTiny
Matsnu
Rovnix
Urlzone
QakBot (aka Qbot, PinkSlip Bot)

Impact
A system infected with Avalanche-associated malware may be subject to malicious activity
including the theft of user credentials and other sensitive data, such as banking and credit
card information. Some of the malware had the capability to encrypt user files and demand a
ransom be paid by the victim to regain access to those files. In addition, the malware may
have allowed criminals unauthorized remote access to the infected computer. Infected
systems could have been used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Solution
Users are advised to take the following actions to remediate malware infections associated
with Avalanche:
Use and maintain anti-virus software – Anti-virus software recognizes and protects your
computer against most known viruses. Even though parts of Avalanche are designed to
evade detection, security companies are continuously updating their software to
counter these advanced threats. Therefore, it is important to keep your anti-virus
software up-to-date. If you suspect you may be a victim of an Avalanche malware,
update your anti-virus software definitions and run a full-system scan. (See
Understanding Anti-Virus Software for more information.)
Avoid clicking links in email – Attackers have become very skilled at making phishing
emails look legitimate. Users should ensure the link is legitimate by typing the link into
a new browser (see Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more
information).
2/4

Change your passwords – Your original passwords may have been compromised
during the infection, so you should change them. (See Choosing and Protecting
Passwords for more information.)
Keep your operating system and application software up-to-date – Install software
patches so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities.
You should enable automatic updates of the operating system if this option is available.
(See Understanding Patches for more information.)
Use anti-malware tools – Using a legitimate program that identifies and removes
malware can help eliminate an infection. Users can consider employing a remediation
tool. A non-exhaustive list of examples is provided below. The U.S. Government does
