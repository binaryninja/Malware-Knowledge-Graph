Militaries

Summary
The previously unknown RomCom RAT threat actor is now targeting Ukrainian military
institutions. The same threat actor is known to deploy spoofed versions of popular software
"Advanced IP Scanner." After being publicly exposed, it switched to another popular
application called "PDF Filler." That indicates the group behind it is actively developing new
capabilities.

Context

1/11

The initial "Advanced IP Scanner" campaign occurred on July 23, 2022. Once the victim
installs a Trojanized bundle, it drops RomCom RAT to the system. On October 10, 2022,
the threat actor improved evasion techniques by obfuscation of all strings, execution as a
COM object, and others.

Attack Vector
Earlier versions of RomCom RAT were distributed via fake websites spoofing the legitimate
"Advanced IP Scanner" application website. The Trojanized "Advanced IP Scanner"
package was hosted on "advanced-ip-scaner[.]com" and "advanced-ip-scanners[.]com"
domains. Both of those domains historically resolved to the same IP address of
167[.]71[.]175[.]165. The threat actor also ensured that both fake websites looked near
identical to the original one - "advanced-IP-scanner.com."

On October 20th, the threat actor deployed a new campaign spoofing the "pdfFiller"
website, dropping a Trojanized version with RomCom RAT as the final payload.

Weaponization
The earliest versions of RomCom RAT came in the "Advanced IP Scanner" package. The
BlackBerry Research and Intelligence team has identified two versions of it –
"Advanced_IP_Scanner_V2.5.4594.1.zip" and "advancedipscanner.msi." The threat actor
spoofed the legitimate tools named "Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.4594.1.exe" by adding a
single letter "V" to the file's name.
Once unpacked, it contains 27 files, of which four are malicious droppers.

Dropper RomCom extracts the payload from its resources and creates it in the following
folder:
С:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\winver.dll
Main RomCom functionalities include, but are not limited to, gathering system information
(disk and files information enumeration), and information about locally installed applications
and memory processes. It also takes screenshots and transmits collected data to the
hardcoded command-and-control (C2). If a special command is received, it supports autodeletion from the victim's machine.

The latest version of RomCom RAT has been bundled in the "PDFFiller.zip" package.

Connection with Attacks on Military Institutions in Ukraine.
On October 21, the threat actor behind the RomCom RAT targeted the military institutions of
Ukraine. The initial infection vector is an email with an embedded link leading to a fake
website dropping the next stage downloader. The lure is a fake document in the Ukrainian
language called "Наказ_309.pdf" (translated to English as "Order_309.pdf").

Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Website

That is an HTML file with a download URL of the next stage malicious Portable Executable
(PE) file.

Dropped malicious "AcroRdrDCx642200120169_uk_UA.exe" file has a valid digital
signature by Signer "Blythe Consulting sp. z o.o.".

Upon execution, it drops the following file: "C:\Users\Public\Libraries\WinApp.dll". The
dropped "WinApp.dll" file contains a single export – "fwdTst". By invoking the "rundll32.exe"
proce3ss, the export is run. Just like previously, the RomCom RAT final payload is extracted
from the resource and saved as "C:\Users\Public\Libraries\rtmpak.dll".
A legitimate clean "pdfFiller" application uses the same signer, "Blythe Consulting sp. z
o.o.". As mentioned above, the app has been abused in the latest campaigns by the
RomCom RAT threat actor.
Both RomCom RAT droppers and the final RAT include local Russian language and
Russian language variants:

Targets
Besides the latest campaign against military institutions from Ukraine, we have found the
RomCom threat actor targeting IT companies, food brokers, and food manufacturing in the
U.S., Brazil, and the Philippines.

Conclusions

8/11

RomCom RAT threat actor is actively developing new techniques targeting victims
worldwide. It's highly likely to expect new threat actor campaigns. At the time of publication,
there is no apparent link to any attributed threat actor.
We are releasing referential IoCs from the previous and the latest campaign targeting
Ukraine.
