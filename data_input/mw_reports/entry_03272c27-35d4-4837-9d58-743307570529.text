Spamhaus Botnet
Threat Update
Q1 2021
After a quiet(ish) end to 2020 in Spamhaus’ botnet world,
the first quarter of this year kicked off in style. The major news
surrounded the takedown of the Emotet botnet in January.
Nonetheless, as one malware departs, others arrive on the
scene, as proved by the 24% increase in the total number
of botnet C&Cs Spamhaus researchers observed.
Welcome to the Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1 2021.

What are botnet controllers?
A ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or ‘botnet
Command & Control’ server is commonly
abbreviated to ‘botnet C&C.’ Fraudsters
use these to both control malware-infected
machines and to extract personal and
valuable data from malware-infected victims.
Botnet C&Cs play a vital role in operations
conducted by cybercriminals who are using
infected machines to send out spam or
ransomware, launch DDoS attacks, commit
e-banking fraud or click-fraud or to mine
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

Desktop computers and mobile devices, like
smartphones, aren’t the only machines that
can become infected. There is an increasing
number of devices connected to the internet,
for example, the Internet of Things (IoT)
devices like webcams, network attached
storage (NAS) and many more items.
These are also at risk of becoming infected.

Spotlight

Emotet is gone, but other threats
are emerging
In January 2021, an international coalition including
authorities from various countries undertook a global action
against the notorious Emotet botnet. Law enforcement
agencies shut down infrastructure operated by the
Emotet gang, sending Emotet botnet traffic to a sinkhole.
The operation appears to have been a success as the
botnet has remained inactive for over two months.
However, Spamhaus Malware Lab experts deem that it’s
highly likely that Emotet will come back into circulation.
Over the past few years, Emotet has flourished, earning
itself the label of being one of the most dangerous online
threats. Miscreants used it to gain an initial foothold in
corporate networks, allowing them to move laterally
within the victims’ network, which in many cases led
to encryption with ransomware.
Sadly, there’s no rest in the botnet world; no sooner is one
botnet extinguished than it’s replaced. Rapidly, other
botnet operators have rushed to fill the void that Emotet
has left.
Miscreants operating botnets like IcedID, Dridex, Quakbot,
and TrickBot sent out large volumes of spam emails
containing malicious documents this quarter. For most
of these threats, the modus operandi is similar to that
of Emotet’s, i.e., gain a foothold in corporate networks
and encrypt them with ransomware.

2 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q1–2021

Emotet
Emotet is a former e-banking Trojan
that targeted e-banking customers
globally. In 2018, Emotet ceased
its e-banking fraud activities and
started to offer infected computers
on a “Pay-Per-Install” model.
From 2019 onwards, Emotet
developed into one of the most
dangerous botnets.

Number of botnet C&Cs observed,
Q1 2021
First of all, let’s look at the number of newly observed
botnet Command & Control servers (C&Cs) in Q1 2021.
In total, Spamhaus Malware Labs has identified 1,660
new botnet C&Cs compared to 1,337 in Q4, 2020.
This is a 24% increase, with an average of 553 botnet
C&Cs per month.

The United States holds onto #1
Despite a small 3% drop in the number of newly
observed botnet C&Cs, the United States remains
top of the leader board.

Increases across Europe
The Netherlands has overtaken Russia and finds
itself in second position, with a total of 207 botnets,

Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,
Q1 2021
Emotet:
In Q1 2021, Emotet re-entered back in at #1. This comes
as no surprise, given our efforts in helping Law
Enforcement agencies take down Emotet botnet
infrastructure in January 2021.

Raccoon:
Raccoon is a credential stealer that is new in town. In
Q1 2021, we identified 45 botnet C&Cs associated with
this new malware.

FickerStealer:
Another credential stealer that has been observed
for the first time in Q1 2021 is FickerStealer, with 25 new
associated botnet C&Cs.

QNodeService:
We first saw this malware in 2020. However, it appears
that QNodeService’s activity completely dropped away
at the start of this year. To date, we have not observed
a single C&C associated with it.

Most abused top-level domains, Q1 2021
For Q1 2021, the gTLD .com remains at the top of our
rankings. A large majority of botnet C&C domains that
Spamhaus Malware Labs identified were hosted on this
TLD. However, we have seen many other listed TLDs
improve their reputation with reductions across the board.

.de:
The ccTLD of Germany has once again entered the Top
20 at #19. Not good! Is this due to a weak anti-abuse
policy at DENIC?

.top & .xyz:
These two gTLDs have a long history of abuse, and it’s
not surprising that they continue to be in the Top 5,
particularly when .top had a 90% increase in the number
of botnet C&Cs it hosted in Q1 2021.

Top-level domains (TLDs) –
a brief overview
There are several different toplevel domains including:
Generic TLDs (gTLDs) – can be
used by anyone
Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) –
some have restricted use within
a particular country or region;
however, others are licensed
for general use giving the same
functionality of gTLDs
Decentralized TLDs (dTLDs) –
independent top-level domains
that are not under the control
of ICANN

Most abused domain registrars, Q1 2021
Namecheap (again!)
After years of being #1 in this Top 20, Namecheap (US)
continues to be the preferred domain registrar for
miscreants registering botnet C&C domains.
When will this change? We don’t know. But given the
long history of abuse at Namecheap, we don’t expect it
to be any time soon!

Eranet International & RegRU
With a massive 249% increase, Eranet International

#2 spot. However, the most significant increase in the
number of botnet C&C domain registrations belongs
to RegRU (Russia), with a whopping 341% increase.

Networks hosting the most newly
observed botnet C&Cs, Q1 2021
For this quarter, we have seen an East/West split,
with a reduction in the number of botnet C&Cs hosted
at providers from the East, only to be swiftly replaced
by cloud service providers in the West.

Russian Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers
Various companies like invs.ru and selectel.ru dropped
out of the Top 20 this quarter. This is very positive news,
particularly when it comes to selectel.ru, who have been
present in the Top 20 list for a long time.

Western VPS providers
Various providers located in the West have entered
the Top 20 chart in Q1 2021 including, google.com,
choopa.com, hetzner.de, and combahton.net.

The worst and the most improved
The most abused network is privacyfirst.sh, a VPN
provider operating out of Germany. Conversely,
amazon.com has reduced the number of newly observed
botnet C&Cs on its network by 44% over the past
quarter. A positive step forward!

Networks hosting the most active
botnet C&Cs, Q1 2021
Last but not least, let’s have a look at the networks that
consistently hosted a large number of active botnet C&Cs.
Sadly, Microsoft heads up this Top 20, with 48 active botnet
C&Cs, followed by Google with 43 active botnet C&Cs.
Networks appearing in this listing tend to have poor
network hygiene and fail to act on abuse complaints – the
absence of change between the past quarters indicates
this fact. The botnets remain active for months!
