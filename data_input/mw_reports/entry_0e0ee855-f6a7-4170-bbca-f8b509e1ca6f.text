During the Christmas season and early into the new year, we noticed a sharp decrease in
spam volume, perhaps as online criminals took a break from their malicious activities and
popped the champagne to celebrate. It could also have been a time to regroup and plan new
strategies for the upcoming year.
In any case, over the weekend we observed a large new campaign purporting to be an email
from ‘Microsoft Security Office’ with a link to a full security report (Microsoft.report.doc). This
was somewhat unexpected, as typically the malicious Office files are directly attached to the
email. Instead, the files are hosted on various servers with a short time to live window.

The booby-trapped document asks users to enable macros in order to launch the malicious
code.

Neutrino Bot
If the macro executes, the final payload will be downloaded and executed. This is Neutrino
bot – which we had analyzed over a year ago and that can:
perform DDoS attacks
capture keystrokes, do form grabbing, take screenshots
spoof DNS requests
download additional malware

Details
After deploying the sample, it installs itself in %APPDATA% in a folder called “UmJn“. This
folder name is typical for the particular edition of Neutrino Bot:

3/9

It starts connecting to the C&C in order to fetch the commands and perform the malicious
actions by querying a script called “tasks.php“.
The list of URLs is hardcoded in the bot in the form of a Base64 string:

URLs extracted from this sample:
http://saferunater.top/n/tasks.php
http://saferunater.xyz/n/tasks.php
http://saferunater.space/n/tasks.php
http://godomenbit.bit/n/tasks.php

Neutrino uses a very simple method of authentication – it sends a cookie with a hardcoded
value:
POST %s HTTP/1.0
Host: %s
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: auth=bc00595440e801f8a5d2a2ad13b9791b
Content-length: %i

In the previously described version it was md5(“admin”). This time it is:
"bc00595440e801f8a5d2a2ad13b9791b" -> md5("just for fun")

While the goals of the bot and major features didn’t change much, the code seems to be
partially rewritten in comparison to the leaked version 3.9.4.
Here is the old version, reporting to the CnC:

The new version – that seems to be 5.2 – is much less verbose. It doesn’t use any strings
that will indicate purpose of any particular value. Additionally, some of the used functions are
loaded dynamically and identified by checksums for the purpose of decreasing code
readability:

The features are also reorganized. For example, there is still a feature of making
screenshots of the victim’s desktop – but its implementation details have changed:

Screen grabbing is a triggered by a command from the C&C:

6/9

The created screenshot is immediately sent to the C&C.
In the past, the same feature was implemented along with the keylogger.

The responsible thread is deployed and the screenshot taken periodically and saved to the
logs along with other grabbed content. When the logs’ size exceeds a defined threshold, they
are uploaded to the C&C:

7/9

The implemented changes improved code quality separating the particular features and
give the operator more control on its execution. Still, the code is not obfuscated but the
authors tried to hide some strings that explicitly show the purpose of the particular
commands.
Just like in the previous case we are dealing with a fully-fledged multipurpose bot – with
various features allowing to steal data and invade privacy, but also to use infected computers
for DDoS attacks or download other malware.

Protection
It is important to remember to be particularly careful with Office documents masquerading as
invoices, or other such reports that leverage the macro feature to execute code that will
download and retrieve the actual payload. As an end user, do not enable macros unless you
completely trust the file or are running it in a virtualized environment. As an IT admin, you
can set policies to permanently disable macros.
Malwarebytes users are protected from this threat via the web or exploit protection modules.
