Cybercrime Exposed

Foreword
Today’s cybercriminals do not necessarily require considerable technical expertise to get the job done, nor, in certain cases,
do they even need to own a computer. All they need is a credit card. A marketplace offering cybercrime tools and services
provides would-be criminals with an arsenal that can either be used as a component of a cyberattack or a handy way of
outsourcing the process entirely.
This underground marketplace is enabling an army of cybercriminals—and the cost is being borne by all citizens.
According to recent research,1 17% of European citizens have been victims of identity theft, costing an average
of £1,076. Indeed, the ease with which such tools are available enables cybercriminals to target not only citizens,
but also businesses and governments at a rapidly growing rate.
Numerous examples of the services-based nature of cybercrime have already caused significant damage. We’re not only
witnessing an increase in volume of such incidents, but also seeing that the individuals partaking in these misdeeds are
far removed from the public perception of the computer hacker.
The growth in the “as-a-service” nature of cybercrime fuels this exponential growth, and this flexible business model
allows cybercriminals to execute attacks at considerably less expense than ever before. Examples include the ability
to rent services for a relatively small sum—services that offer financial return or that claim to be able to bring down
entire sites or systems.
This paper provides insight into the cybercrime marketplace and presents pricing schemes for the services offered.
Clearly, these prices will differ based on the sources. One point, however, must be clear: much like law enforcement
partners around the world, EC3 European Cybercrime is relentless in the pursuit of criminal groups or networks
who steal your money, your information, or your identity and of those who engage in online abuse of children.

Cybercrime Exposed

Executive Summary
There’s no doubt that cybercrime is on the increase. That is the message from multiple sources across both the public
and private sectors. Indeed, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported a decline in physical crimes such as bank
robberies in 2012,2 as opposed to cybercrime, which has increased at an alarming rate. Clearly, the risk associated with
physical crimes, such as bank robberies, contributes to such a shift; cybercriminals enjoy the luxury of carrying out their
crimes from a physical location of their choosing.
However, one possible contributing factor to this increase is the ease with which cybercrime tools are available. Moreover,
the cybercrime market now affords potential criminals with a multitude of services which means that deep technical
expertise is not a prerequisite. Much like cloud computing, the services-based nature of cybercrime allows greater
efficiency and flexibility when conducting business.
The ability to provide technology solutions as a service to businesses has allowed organizations to focus on their core
competencies. An unintended consequence of this evolution has been the rise of the as-a-service acronym “aaS” and
a marketplace offering multiple variants of hosted services.
Although this approach may seem innovative, the as-a-service model itself is nothing new. The underground economy
established by nefarious cybercriminals has used a services-based model for considerably longer than businesses have
enjoyed the benefits of cloud computing. Although the term Crimeware-as-a-Service may be relatively new, the servicesbased nature of cybercrime has been in effect considerably longer than its descriptive acronym. Moreover, the servicesbased approach extends well beyond hiring individuals to undertake specific tasks (for example, coding an exploit), with
a broad variety of products and services available either to buy or rent.
This paper analyzes the growth of the “as-a-service” nature of cybercrime. In particular, it focuses on the evolving manner
in which the various actors advertise their services and on the multitude of services now available along with their
associated costs. What has become evident is that the marketplace contains many stakeholders, ranging from formal,
legitimate organizations selling vulnerabilities to parties that meet their strict eligibility criteria to underground websites
that allow individuals to offer illegal services. The focus on cybercrime at a global level by law enforcement has led to
“as‑a-service” models for illegal activities going even deeper underground.
Such underground platforms are implementing stronger mechanisms to ensure that participants are who they purport
to be (or at the very least are not law enforcement officials). Ironically, while the platforms that facilitate the services
marketplace for illegal activities are going deeper underground, the trade in zero-day vulnerabilities is more transparent
than ever before.
Cybercrime-as-a-Service
There is a multitude of services available to the would-be cybercriminal. Most of these services are clearly administrated
by cybercriminals. There are, however, a number of services that remain legal. Overall, we can class services as part of
black or gray markets. The classification “gray” is used when the activities or real customers are difficult to determine.
To simplify the marketplace, we propose four categories:
1. Research-as-a-Service—Unlike other categories, Research-as-a-Service does not have to originate from illegal sources;
there is room for a gray market. There are commercial companies that provide the sale of zero-day vulnerabilities
to organizations that meet their eligibility criteria. And, there are individuals who act as middlemen, selling such
intellectual property to willing buyers who may or may not have the same strict eligibility requirements.
2. Crimeware-as-a-Service—This incorporates the identification and development of the exploits used for the intended
operation—and may also include development of ancillary material to support the attack (droppers, downloaders,
keyloggers, bots, and more). This also includes tools used to conceal malware from security protection mechanisms
(cryptors, polymorphic builders, joiners, crackers, and the like), as well as spammer/robot tools like XRumer. In addition,
this category includes the availability of hardware that may be used for financial fraud (for example, card skimming)
or equipment used to hack into physical platforms.

3. Cybercrime Infrastructure-as-a-Service—Once the toolset has been developed, cybercriminals are faced with the
challenge of delivering their exploits to their intended victims. An example is rental of a network of computers to
carry out a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Other examples include the availability of platforms to host malicious
content, such as bullet-proof hosting.
4. Hacking-as-a-Service —Acquiring the individual components of an attack remains one option; alternatively, there are
services that allow for outsourcing of the attack entirely. This path requires minimal technical expertise, although it
is likely to cost more than acquiring individual components. This category also supports the availability of information
to be used for identity theft, for example, requesting information such as bank credentials, credit card data, and login
details to particular websites.
Many services within the cybercrime ecosystem broadly fit within the preceding categories. This paper does not intend
to provide an exhaustive overview of every available service, but rather incorporates some key services as an illustration
of the ecosystem and of the “as-a-service” nature of cybercrime today.
Research-as-a-Service
The available services within this category include the identification of a previously unknown vulnerability within the
targeted system, otherwise known as a zero-day vulnerability. Despite the threat of legal action by affected software
vendors in certain countries, the sale of vulnerabilities has recently become a growth area for researchers and brokers
alike. Today, security researchers are presented with a number of options when they identify previously unidentified
zero‑day vulnerabilities. Each represents differing outcomes in publicity and monetary compensation.
Vulnerabilities for sale: a commercial marketplace
Today’s marketplace provides those looking to acquire zero-day vulnerabilities with many options. At first glance,
this may appear to be detrimental to underground marketplaces. However, since many organizations selling zero-day
vulnerabilities actually limit their sale to specific buyers, the underground market continues to thrive. For example, one
particular vendor defines its eligibility requirements as being limited to only public sector organizations, in particular,
law enforcement. Furthermore, restrictions are placed on the geographic location of the agency; its customers can only
be in predefined countries.
Exploit brokers
Although the acquisition of vulnerabilities can be conducted via a commercial entity, there is an opportunity to connect
with a brokering service, which can be defined as a single individual who acts as a middleman to facilitate the sale
to a third party. A recent article in Forbes 3 provides details of one such individual known as the Grugq. By acting as a
middleman for the sale of exploits to government agencies, the broker was able to facilitate the sale of an Apple iOS
exploit for $250,000 and pocket 15% in commission. Table 1 provides the prices that were quoted for zero‑day exploits.

Cybercrime Exposed

This is just one example, and the middleman in this case represents one individual. As this particular industry is not illegal,
there is no shortage of available middlemen advertising their services on very public forums such as Twitter, among others.
One Twitter offer we saw read: “Hi...we have 5 0days that will enter in the auction process.”
The market for these types of services today is very different from the market of six years ago. The 2007 paper, The Legitimate
Vulnerability Market; Inside the Secretive World of 0-day Exploit Sales,4 states, “The current market for the legitimate sale
of zero-day exploits is not openly accessible.” However, it is worth noting that although more options may exist, some
of the previous challenges from 2007 are still present. As Table 1 indicates, the prices for vulnerabilities vary significantly.
Indeed, the level of transparency regarding potential remuneration remains unavailable publicly, which makes decisions
about the most profitable route to selling any zero-day vulnerabilities significantly more difficult.
Spam services
A successful spam campaign relies on a number of factors, many of which we cover later. However, one element belongs
in the Research-as-a-Service category, namely the identification of targets. Having to manually gather together an email list
can be a time-consuming exercise—fortunately the would-be spammer has the luxury of simply purchasing a list of email
addresses. This is depicted in Figure 1; in this instance, a list of email addresses is available for individuals in France. Aside
from the customization of the message in a particular language, the unsolicited email may require more granularity. For
example, if there is something particularly relevant in a US state, there are services that supply email addresses belonging
to individuals from a specific state, as depicted in Figure 2. In this illustration, the would-be spammer has the opportunity
to acquire 10 million email addresses of individuals based in Florida.

Figure 1. French email addresses for sale.

Figure 2. Florida residents email addresses for sale.

Cybercrime Exposed

Of course, these two examples are merely the tip of the iceberg. They are indicative of the market and the level of
granularity. Services are available that offer buyers the ability to purchase varying volumes to support their unsolicited
email campaigns. For example, a campaign may target specific users of a service, a particular bank, or an Internet service
provider. Or a campaign may target specific professions or even a particular gender. In such instances, the underground
marketplace supports the acquisition of such lists, as depicted in Figure 3. As this illustrates, it is possible to identify a
specific profession as well as geography, such as US doctors. Another consideration should be the manner in which the
service is offered. The presentation of the service is similar to those offered by legitimate companies selling legal products;
some even offer commercial payment mechanisms.

Figure 3. Anyone call for a doctor?

Later, we will look at other services that support campaigns to propagate unsolicited email. This includes the infrastructure
required to distribute the mail, as well as the back-end systems used to host malicious content.
Crimeware-as-a-Service
While the trade in zero-day vulnerabilities may exist within public forums, the underground market offers these and
considerably more services. If we focus our attention on the available tools, we find a multitude of cybercrime tools
available for either sale or rent. Below are many of the Crimeware-as-a-Service tools available today.
Professional services
Developing code to take advantage of a specific vulnerability requires a degree of technical expertise—at the very least,
software programming skills. However, much like the outsourcing market for commercial software, we can find services
that offer such code for nefarious purposes. The outsourcing of this particular element of the attack has been around
for some time, with some specific examples of malware being outsourced to a third party. An example of this was
seen as early as 2005, with the Zotob worm. In this example, a programmer was paid to develop the malware, which
was estimated to have cost affected companies $97,000 to clean up.5
Other professional services available include translations. In the Research-as-a-Service category, we saw how it was
possible to acquire email addresses for a specific country. If the attacker is a native speaker, then crafting an email to
entice victims is relatively simple.
Not knowing a language is no hindrance, however. Services provide translations to support non-native speakers in their
efforts to communicate with potential victims.

7

Cybercrime Exposed

Figure 4 shows a forum that offers translation services to would-be buyers. In this example, a communication method
is defined, but also included is a reputational indicator. Much like the modern social media tools we use today, there
is an indicator as to the reputation of the individual behind the profile.

Figure 4. Translation services for hire.

Malware services
Numerous malware variants are available for sale. Purchasers can acquire developed code to conduct their attacks.
For example, attackers who want to acquire information can buy a Trojan horse, a malicious program concealed
within a legitimate file. Other examples include:
• Rootkit services—Surreptitious code that conceals itself within the compromised system and performs actions

as programmed.
• Ransomware services—Software that restricts the user from conducting further activity until a specific action

(such as providing credit card details). Such software is available for sale within the underground market.
Exploits
As we mentioned earlier, there are many options to purchase exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities. Their prices
vary based upon the target system and whether the vulnerability has been previously identified.
There is also the opportunity to rent as opposed to buying. The CritX toolkit, for example, charges by the day, recently
advertised for $150 per day.

Cybercrime Exposed

Figure 5 shows the sale of such exploits. This illustration includes the details of the targeted system, a brief description,
and its price. Also of interest are prices, which closely align with the potential impact of the exploit. Those classified as
high impact are approximately three times as expensive as those classified as low/moderate.

Figure 5. Exploits for sale—the higher the impact, the higher the price.

9

Cybercrime Exposed

There are also exploit packs that offer encryption services used to conceal an attack and avoid detection. This may include
encrypting particular files, which may be used in conjunction with other techniques using encryption to further disguise
the malicious code. An example of such exploit packs, with the crypter capability as an additional feature, is depicted
in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Exploit packs come with add-ons.

Another available service is checking files against security software. Cybercriminals want to ensure that all of their hard
work is not blocked at the first hurdle by antivirus software. Services such as those in Figure 7 illustrate that rather
than going through the arduous process of buying, installing, updating, and testing their malware against antivirus
software, attackers have an alternative, more efficient option. In this instance, the service providers test the malware
against 35 antivirus vendors’ solutions. In addition, they provide a service that tests the sending domain against a known
list of domain blacklists. Such lists are used by companies and service providers to block email from domains that are
known to send content against their policies, such as spam.
We mentioned earlier the low cost of cloud computing when compared with internal services, and an association
with cybercrime. The prices quoted in the bottom right of Figure 7 undoubtedly validate that assertion. At a cost of
$30 per month, and only $0.15 per check, the outsourced service proves not only cost effective but also efficient in
terms of time spent. The implications of such a service are very clear: the bad guys have the opportunity to ensure
that their malware is better and more likely to succeed, which will have significant ramifications for all Internet users.

Figure 7. The low cost of cybercrime services.

Cybercrime Exposed

Within this category a number of products and services are available for sale, and, more recently, for rent. Potential buyers
can engage in as much or as little activity (such as programming or researching) as they like, with the only constraints
being how deep their pockets are, their technical competence, and available time. In some instances, certain services in
this category are not illegal, with commercial companies offering their expertise on public forums.
Cybercrime Infrastructure-as-a-Service
A number of infrastructure services are available to support a cybercrime operation. These range from the availability
of services to conduct DoS attacks to hosting malicious content.
Botnets
A robot network, or botnet, is a network of infected computers under the remote control of an online cybercriminal.
The botnet can be used for a number of services, such as sending spam, launching DoS, and distributing malware.
Figure 8 illustrates the cost of renting a botnet and the flexible options available. In effect, multiple services are available to
suit any budget.

Figure 8. Botnet services.

Cybercrime Exposed

Hosting services
A “bulletproof” hosting provider is a company that knowingly provides web or domain hosting (or other related services)
to cybercriminals, intending to ignore complaints by turning a blind eye to the malevolent use of their services. Such
services are illustrated in Figure 9. Other individuals may provide considerably more options and with different pricing
structures. This is illustrated with the services provided by an individual known as Matad0r, who provides three levels of
service ranging from $50 per month to as much as $400 per month. The variable pricing is based on the specification of
the system provided. A more powerful system with more options mean a higher price. This demonstrates that, much like
the commercial environment, a myriad of hosting services are available—the only constraint is the amount of money one
is willing to pay, and, in some cases, the ethics of the hosting provider.

Figure 9. Secure hosting.

12

Cybercrime Exposed

Spam services
Numerous services are available for the would-be spammer. These include the availability of services that support
the sending of unsolicited mail, alternatively known as a mail relay. Figure 10 shows a service capable of sending
30,000,000 emails. What is particularly relevant is how the proposition is presented. The service offers a live chat
option with a customer service agent, as well as payment options many of us are accustomed to in the legitimate
world. The “as‑a-service” nature of the proposition is further emphasized by the fact that the would-be cybercriminal
is provided the relay for just one month (with an upper limit of 30,000,000 emails).

Figure 10. This spam service offers support, just like many legitimate online offers.

Of course, simply having an infrastructure is not enough to support an unsolicited email campaign. There is also a need
for the email addresses themselves, as well as a back-end set of systems to continue the deception. The latter could be
hosted through bulletproof hosting services, and the former is covered under the Research-as-a-Service category.

13

Cybercrime Exposed

Hacking-as-a-Service
If the budget allows, a budding cybercriminal can skip the process of conducting research, building appropriate tools,
and developing an infrastructure to launch a cyberattack by choosing a service that will outsource the entire process.
Password cracking services
There are a multitude of services available within the Hacking-as-a-Service category. The following examples illustrate
how little technical knowledge is required for buyers try their hand at cybercrime. Figure 11 illustrates a service that makes
it easy for a buyer to retrieve an email password—with no technical expertise. In this example, all that is required is the
email address and name of the target. After that, all that remains to be done is enter the password and pay for the service.

Figure 11. Need an email password? It’s as simple as providing address, name, and payment.

14

Cybercrime Exposed

What is really surprising is that the service providers remind their buyers about the junk (bulk) email folder. Such a simple
reminder illustrates how the level of technical expertise required for this new breed of cybercriminal is incredibly low.
Denial-of-service
Much of the press has been awash with stories of hacktivists bringing down large companies with sophisticated hacking
techniques. The reality is very different. Although many attacks may be sophisticated, many of them are simply DoS
attacks (or distributed denial-of-service [DDos] attacks). These DoS services aim to send a huge volume of traffic to the
victim and prevent them from conducting normal business operations.
Building a cyberarmy capable of generating enough traffic does, at the very least, require an investment in time that
the would-be cybercriminal may not have. Fortunately for them (and unfortunately for the rest of us), the “as-a-service”
cybercrime market is there to help. Figure 12 shows the price list for a “Cheap Professional DDOS Service.” This service
simply requires attackers to inform the service of which site they wish to launch a DDoS attack against, decide how
much they are willing to pay, and then initiate the service.

Figure 12. This service offers to launch a DoS attack for a very low price.

15

Cybercrime Exposed

What may surprise many of us is the low cost of the service. This may demystify the sophisticated portrayal of today’s
hacker. For only $2 per hour, an attack can be launched against the systems of the buyer’s choosing. What is particularly
interesting is the comment about not providing any refunds. Outside of cybercrime, is there any other criminal activity in
which the company that knowingly facilitates the crime feels the need to remind their customers that there are no refunds?
Credit card information
Many services offer credit card information. In many cases, they offer considerable flexibility and varying price models
based upon the information sold. An example of prices are depicted in Table 2.

The “Dumps” in Table 2 refer to the information that is copied from the magnetic stripe on the back of credit and debit
cards. The information includes two tracks of data on the magnetic stripe. Track 1 is alphanumeric and contains the name
of the customer and the account number. Track 2 is numeric and contains the account number, expiration date, the secure
code (CVV), and discretionary institution data. A third track is rarely used. This is graphically represented in Figure 13.

Conclusion
This white paper offers a view into the reality and size of the cybercrime market. Entire books have been dedicated to
providing insights into how hackers have profited from individual services within these broad categories, and there are
many other services that have not been included in this paper.
Any paper that purports to be an exhaustive summary of services available on the underground market is likely to be out
of date even before the author clicks “save.” This report offers readers a snapshot of the cybercrime market and how its
services-based nature supports new entrants who do not require technical expertise. All that the modern cybercriminal
needs to provide Cybercrime as-a-Service is a means with a payment method. We are witnessing the emergence of a
whole new breed of cybercriminal. As a result, the volume of cyberattacks is likely to increase, and current trends and
data suggest that this is exactly what we are seeing today.
