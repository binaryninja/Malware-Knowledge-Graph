Phish Found in Environments Protected by SEGs
Proofpoint
By Kyle Duncan, Cofense Phishing Defense Center
As the world continues to contend with a tenacious pandemic, many employers are obliged
to revisit medical-benefit policies. The Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has
observed a new phishing campaign that aims to harvest Microsoft login credentials by posing

as a company-wide sick/medical leave policy update.

Figure 1-2: Email Body

3/5

The sender’s email address is spoofed to appear as though the email is originating from the
company’s SharePoint services by using the format “Sharepoint@[companyname].com“.
However, one look into the email’s header information shows that this is not the case and
that the email originated from outside of the organization, potentially from a
compromised account operated by the threat actor.
The email body itself is put together well and, at a glance, appears as though it could be
legitimate. It even contains little details such as “This link will only work for anyone at
[company name]” and “Microsoft OneDrive for [user’s email].” The threat actor has spoofed a
legitimate Microsoft notification to appear legitimate, using a format the recipient would
quickly trust at first glance. Since the file being shared refers to the company’s approach on
sick leave during COVID-19, users are naturally going to be curious about what their
company is doing for them.
The glaring flaw with the email body is where it references both Microsoft OneDrive
and SharePoint. Since the spoofed email address is attempting to trick the user into thinking
this is a shared SharePoint file, it does not make sense for the email body to reference both
of these services. It thus raises suspicion. The button users are intended to click also
references OneDrive and, hovering over it, it reveals that the domain of the destination
(oraclecloud[.]com) has nothing to do with Microsoft. It is apparent that this is not what it
claims to be.
Upon visiting the malicious URL, users are taken to a fake Microsoft login page as shown in
Figure 3.

4/5

The email address field of the login is automatically populated with the user’s email so they
would only have to include their password. The page even includes the company’s logo
to more effectively pass the login off as legitimate. Once the credentials have been secured,
the user is then redirected to a page containing COVID-19 documentation, as seen in Figure
4, that seemingly appears relevant to what was mentioned in the email. While many phishing
attempts redirect the user to a legitimate login page, the use of this document instead is
another attempt to prevent the realization that the user’s credentials were just stolen.
