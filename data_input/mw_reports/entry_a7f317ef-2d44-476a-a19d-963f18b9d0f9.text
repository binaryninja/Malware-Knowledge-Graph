Key Points
On June 15, 2022 a new Android Banking Trojan, dubbed as Revive, was discovered
in the wild by Cleafy TIR team.
According to the evidence found on its code and its command and control infrastructure
(C2), Revive appears to be at its early stages.
Revive appears to be delivered against Spanish citizens through phishing campaigns
targeting customers of a specific top-tier Spanish bank.
Revive will enable Threat Actors (TA) to perform Account Takeover attacks, (ATO).
Currently, Revive has three main capabilities:
- Capturing everything written on the device through a keylogger module.
- Performing "on-device" phishing attacks through the usage of clone pages, which aim
to steal banking login credentials.
- Intercepting all SMS received on the infected device, typically from banks and
financial institutions in the PSD2 area (e.g. authorization codes 2FA/OTP)

To increase the attacks' success-rate, TAs created a video explainer, to support victims
during the installation once the malicious application has been downloaded.

Executive Summary
In June 2022, a new Android banking trojan was discovered by the Cleafy TIR team. Since
the lack of information and the absence of a proper nomenclature of this malware family, we
decided to dub it as Revive to better track this family inside our internal Threat Intelligence
taxonomy.
The name Revive has been chosen since one of the functionality of the malware (called by
the TAs precisely “revive”) is restarting in case the malware stops working.
Revive belongs to a category of malware used for persistent campaigns, as it was developed
and tailored for a specific target. This type of malware is quite different from other famous
Android banking trojans, such as TeaBot or SharkBot, that are able, at the same time, to
attack multiple banks/crypto apps installed on the infected device through their modular
architecture.
However, the attack’s methodologies of Revive are similar to other banking trojans as it still
abuses the Accessibility Services to perform keylogging activities and to intercept SMS
messages of the victim. The combination of these features are enough to perform Account
Takeover attacks (ATO), since TAs are able to obtain login credentials and the 2FA/OTP sent
via SMS by banks.
So far, both samples of Revive have a very low detection rate by Antivirus solutions (AVs).
As shown by Figure 2, the second sample has zero detection rate, since the malware is
clearly still under development.

Technical Analysis

Figure 3 - Phishing website used to deliver Revive
As in the majority of cases, Revive uses different Social Engineering techniques to appear as
a legitimate app in order to mislead the victims. In fact, the malware is delivered through a
phishing page and it hides behind a new 2FA app of the targeted bank.

Once the victim downloads the malware, Revive tries to obtain the Accessibility Service
feature through a pop-up. This permission is used for functionality, therefore monitoring and
stealing information from the victim device.

Figure 4 – Installation of Revive
When the victim opens the malicious app for the first time, Revive asks to accept two
permissions related to the SMS and phone calls. After that, a clone page (of the targeted
bank) appears to the user (as shown in Figure 5) and if the login credentials are inserted,
they are sent to the C2 of the TAs. After that, the malware shows a generic home page, with
different links that redirect to the legitimate bank website.

Analyzing the code, our hypothesis is that the developer of Revive took inspiration from an
open source spyware called “Teardroid”, available on GitHub[3], since there are some code
and name similarities both in the application and in the C2 infrastructure used. However,
Teardroid is a spyware with different capabilities, while Revive has been developed with a
different purpose. TAs removed some features of Teardroid and added new ones in this new
variant, enabling ATO attacks. This is why Revive can be considered a banking trojan
instead of a spyware.

Figure 7 – Example of comparison between Teardroid and Revive
Moving to its C2 infrastructure, other similar features can be observed as well, since both of
them appear to be based on FastAPI, a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in
Python, similar to Django/Flask.
In fact, it appears that TAs also create a variant of the Teardroid control panel [4], adapting it
for their needs during a fraud operation (e.g. collecting valid credentials, intercepting SMS
messages, etc..).
The following figure shows some of the similarities found during our investigation:

Figure 8 – C2 infrastructure similarities
Revive has been developed with the goal of performing ATO attacks against a specific target.
In order to achieve this task, the malware has three capabilities:
Steal the login credentials. The following task can be achieved both with the clone
page shown to the user and with the keylogger feature, through the abuse of the
Accessibility Services.
Intercept all messages received from the infected devices, with the aim of obtaining the
2FA of the bank sent to the user via SMS.
Grab everything that the user writes on the device (e.g credentials, messages, phone
numbers etc, as shown in Figure 10). Those information are saved on a local database
and sent to the C2 server.

Final Considerations
Concurrently to the well-known Android Banking Trojan, like SharkBot, TeaBot or
Oscorp/UBEL, that are complex malware with multiple features able to carry out advanced
attacks like ATO/ATS, there are also small and tailored campaigns, probably conducted by
local TAs. The latter types of scenarios sometimes could be more difficult to intercept, since
the malware are usually written from scratch (often not detected by antivirus solutions), with
few features tailored for only one target and the campaigns are carried out for only a few
days.
At the time of writing, it is difficult to make an hypothesis about the future of Revive, since the
malware is still in its early stages (although it is already able to perform ATO attacks); TAs
could improve it following multiple paths (e.g.adding new features and transform Revive into
a RAT or customizing the malware for other targets).
