The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the potential threat
posed by attempts to spread disinformation regarding the results of the 2020 elections.
Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites, change existing websites, and
create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt
to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.
State and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections’ final
results in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of
mail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on
election night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and
announce elections’ results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter
suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud, and other
problems intended to convince the public of the elections’ illegitimacy.
The FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the
information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted
sources, such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if

foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related
website, the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.
Recommendations

Seek out information from trustworthy sources, such as state and local election
officials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.
Verify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election
results, and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such
information via social media or other avenues.
For information about final election results, rely on state and local government election
officials.
Report potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or
place of voting—to the FBI.
If appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for
reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information
about election-related problems or results.
The FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious
cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is
responsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.
The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and
resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.
