Symantec’s artificial-intelligence-based Targeted Attack Analytics
uncovers new wide-ranging espionage operation.
One of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the
number of groups adopting “living off the land” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of
operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’
networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and tools,
attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of
legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it
can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to
distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom
malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery.

Finding the needle in the haystack
This doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that
they can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec
created Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve
developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat
Protection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine
learning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns
associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have
taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our
customers, to find that “needle in the haystack.”
It was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in
January 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An
attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s network.
PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one
of the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live
off the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of
PsExec can be difficult to spot.
TAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were
using it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware
(Infostealer.Catchamas) on computers within the victim’s network.

Armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by
this group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could
find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We
uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being
used against targets that are a cause for concern.
We identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive
is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging,
and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia.

Eye on the sky: Thrip’s targets
Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite
communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the
operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that
monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying
and may also include disruption.
Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip
seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers
running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks
such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into
other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin
imaging software.
The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The
group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all
cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms
companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.
In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.

Attempting to hide in plain sight
Thrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks.
The latter include:

4/6

PsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The
tool was primarily used by the attackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.
PowerShell: Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download
payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.
Mimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security
certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext.
WinSCP: Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.
LogMeIn: Cloud-based remote access software. It’s unclear whether the attackers
gained unauthorized access to the victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created
their own.
All of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously),
have legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast
majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems
administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention.
Through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot
patterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was
being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its
cover.
While Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom
malware (Infostealer.Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a
custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains
additional features designed to avoid detection.

Highly targeted espionage operation
From the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled
us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers
within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage
is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it
could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.
