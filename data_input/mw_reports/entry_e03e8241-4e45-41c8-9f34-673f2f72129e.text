Hold My Beer Mirai – Spinoff Named ‘LiquorBot’ Incorporates Cryptomining

2/10

The Mirai botnet that made headlines in 2016 for taking out infrastructure through largescale network attacks has become a reference point in the security industry for the damage
that large IoT botnets can inflict. Since its source code was published and made available to
anyone interested in building their own botnet, many Mirai variants have shown up, each
packing unique features. While most are used for disruptive purposes, others seem to use
the collective power of compromised devices to mine for cryptocurrency.
Bitdefender researchers tracked the development of a Mirai-inspired botnet, dubbed
LiquorBot, which seems to be actively in development and has recently incorporated
Monero cryptocurrency mining features.
Interestingly, LiquorBot is written in Go (also known as Golang), which offers some
programming advantages over traditional C-style code, such as memory safety, garbage
collection, structural typing, and even CSP-style concurrency.
LiquorBot appears to use the same command and control server as a Mirai-related variant,
and they have even featured together in dropper scripts, meaning attackers used both
LiquorBot and the Mirai variant in various campaigns.
The LiquorBot IoT botnet was identified using Bitdefender’s deceptive technologies, when
the first LiquorBot samples infected our honeypots in May 2019. Since then, Bitdefender
security researchers tracked the development of the main package, as well as all its other
versions associated with feature updates and upgrades.
Key Findings
Re-implementation of Mirai written in Go
Cross-compiled to several architectures (ARM, ARM64, x86, x64, MIPS)
Incorporates cryptocurrency-mining features
Propagation through SSH brute-forcing and exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in
select router models
Timeline
The following table (Fig. 1) follows the evolution of the botnet, listing SHA-1 hashes, the
development path of the main package and the date they were first seen by our honeypots
telemetry. Though each version has samples associated to multiple CPU architectures, for
simplicity, we have included only hashes for ARM64.

Fig. 1 – Timeline of LiquorBot sample
While some of the samples analyzed include versioning strings, they do not seem to
accurately reflect the evolution of the botnet. For instance, the Oct 1st sample is labeled
“0.2” and it’s the one actually introducing the cryptocurrency mining feature. This feature is
not present in the July 24th sample, labeled “0.6”, which features additional propagation
methods.
Dropper Script
LiquorBot is cross-compiled to several architectures, targeting a wide range of CPU
architectures ranging from ARM and ARM64 to x86, x64 and MIPS. During the infection
process, the dropper script downloads all the bot payloads, without having any filtration
logic based on the found CPU architecture.
The dropper script itself is relatively short and involves fetching the binaries from an
attacker-controlled server. Another interesting feature of the script is the use of “#!/bin/sh”,
which is more reliable than “#!/bin/bash” when pointing to the preferred POSIX-compatible
system shell in any installation. In addition, because the script does not appear to load any
specific features supported by “bash”, the “sh” variant chosen by the malware developers is
considered the default shell that system scripts should use.

The miner configuration script used by threat actors seems to set different hashrates for the
CPU mining algorithm (Fig. 3)

Features
Like Mirai, LiquorBot obfuscates its strings and stores them into a map. Each time an entry
dis accessed, the string is decrypted by adding the vadlue 0x51 to each character. The
figure below lists the decrypted strings for LiquorBot.

Another feature borrowed from Mirai ensures that a single bot runs on a machine by
attempting to bind to a port. The host and port used as arguments to “net.Listen” are from
the configuration map (entry number 9). Other versions of the bot have the port set to
42007.
Fig. 5 – Infection command
Upon execution, the bot relaunches itself, while attempting to disguise the new process as
the sshd daemon.
The bot updates the DNS resolver by writing to /etc/resolv.conf the following:

The bot’s lifecycle contains a cleanup phase, in which it deletes any dropped files
(/tmp/.lmr,/tmp/.ldrop, /tmp/config.json) and erases bash history.
The bot communicates with multiple servers:
CnC; the bot reports vulnerable devices to this server and receives commands from it
mining server
server hosting the binaries
Throughout its evolution, the domains used for these purposes have been changed and
interchanged from the following:
wpceservice.hldns.ru
ardp.hldns.ru
bpsuck.hldns.ru
LiquorBot periodically pings its C&C though a HTTP GET targeting this resource:

Fig. 7 – LiquorBot C&C resource
The query parameters represent fingerprinting data for the device and bot: OS, bot version,
CPU architecture, number of CPUs, etc.
The C&C can respond with one of the following commands:
download
rget
exec
shutdown
The first command downloads a resource from a provided URL into /tmp/.ldrop. The second
command does the same, but also executes the file using “sh -c”.
The miner goroutine downloads the miner into /tmp/.lmr, formats the config and writes it to
/tmp/config.json, then runs the miner with the config. The config is the JSON found in the
configuration map formatted to fill out the server with the address of the mining server (entry
2 for host and entry 3 for port) and the username (randomly generated string formed of 17
uppercase letters).
Propagation
Among the analyzed LiquorBot samples, we have seen various methods of propagation.
Most versions use SSH brute-forcing as the sole propagation method.

8/10

The samples from July 24th include SSH brute-forcing, by using a hardcoded list of 82
username/password combinations, while also using exploits for various models of
vulnerable routers.
In terms of exploited vulnerabilities, LiquorBot exploits some critical CVEs (CVE-2015-2051,
CVE-2016-1555, CVE-2016-6277) as well as a series of command injection and remote
command execution vulnerabilities found in various router models (CVE-2018-17173, CVE2017-6884, CVE-2018-10562, CVE-2017-6077, CVE-2017-6334, CVE-2016-5679, CVE2018-9285, CVE-2013-3568, CVE-2019-12780).
