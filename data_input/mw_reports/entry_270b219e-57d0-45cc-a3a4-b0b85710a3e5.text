VisionDirect, a popular contact lens online merchant in Europe, has posted an advisory
stating that their web site had a data breach that led to the theft of credit card and account
information.
According to the notification, account and payment information entered on the site between
November 3rd and November 8th could have been captured and sent to attackers. This data
includes all account information such as billing addresses, phone numbers, and credit card
information.
"The personal information was compromised when it was being entered into the site and
includes full name, billing address, email address, password, telephone number and
payment card information, including card number, expiry date and CVV," stated the advisory.
VisionDirect stated that Paypal payment credentials would not have been stolen.
This attack only affected visitors who logged into their accounts and entered or updated their
account information during the affected period. Users who simply visited the site or used
store billing information would not have been affected.
VisionDirect said they will be contacting all affected customers in the next few days.

Compromise was caused by MageCart script
This data breach was caused by a MageCart attack, which is when attackers add malicious
JavaScript to a site that captures payment and account information when it is entered into a
form or submitted.
In this particular attack, a script was added various VisionDirect domains that pretended to
be Google Analytics.
That's exactly what it was. The data was stolen via a fake Google Analytics script:
https://g-analytics[.]com/libs/1.0.16/analytics.js – you can view a copy of the JS via the

While the script looks very similar to the normal Google Analytics code, the domain ganalytics[.]com is not actually owned by Google. Instead this domain is owned by the
attackers who use it to store the stolen credit card and account information.

Malicious script on VisionDirect pretending to be Google Analytics
Security researcher Willem de Groot told BleepingComputer that he had discovered this
domain being used in MageCart attacks in early September.
"In this case, the breach is related to several payment exfiltration domain that we saw earlier,
such as g-statistic .com, google-anaiytic .com, msn-analytics .com"

De Groot further stated that even though the advisory only mentions visiondirect.co.uk,
domains for other countries were also affected.
It wasn't just UK. Also infected between Nov 3rd and
Nov8th:https://t.co/fQy7WsKmfqhttps://t.co/8JUn9frF9vhttps://t.co/WBCPQOIv46https:/

While the script is heavily obfuscated, one portion containing a list of strings used by the
script was easily decoded. In the below script you can see various strings that are being
monitored such as payment, checkout, admin, login, password, account, and cart
submissions.

Decoded Strings
Recently we reported on the Infowars.com's online store also being compromised with a
MageCart attack. In that attack, the malicious script was also masquerading as Google
Analytics but used the domain google-analyitics[.]org instead. While the attack method is
similar, the script itself is quite different.
When BleepingComputer asked De Groot if there was any connection between these
attackers and the one who targeted InfoWars, he said there was no way to conclude that
they were same group.
"Could be, but I have not found other commonalities so far," De Groot told
BleepingComputer. "They certainly use different type of malware. Sorry, I see it would be
nice if you could link them up. But cannot say for sure."
Alex Jones, the owner of Infowars, felt that his attackers were Communist China, "Big
Tech", and the U.S. Democratic party.

BleepingComputer has contacted VisionDirect regarding this breach, but had not heard back
at the time of this publication.
