Hydrochasma: Previously Unknown Group Targets
Medical and Shipping Organizations in Asia
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/hydrochasma-asia-medical-shipping-intelligencegathering

Shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia are being targeted in a likely
intelligence-gathering campaign that relies exclusively on publicly available and living-offthe-land tools.
Hydrochasma, the threat actor behind this campaign, has not been linked to any previously
identified group, but appears to have a possible interest in industries that may be involved in
COVID-19-related treatments or vaccines.
This activity has been ongoing since at least October 2022. While Symantec, by Broadcom
Software, did not see any data being exfiltrated in this campaign, the targets, as well as some
of the tools used, indicate that the most likely motivation in this campaign is intelligence
gathering.

Attack Chain
The infection vector used by Hydrochasma was most likely a phishing email. The first
suspicious activity seen on machines is a lure document with a file name in the victim
organization’s native language that appears to indicate it was an email attachment:
[TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] Product Specification-Freight-Company
Qualification Information wps-pdf Export.pdf.exe
Another lure document appears to be mimicking a resume:
[TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] [REDACTED] University-Development
Engineer.exe
Following initial access on one machine, the attackers were seen dropping Fast Reverse
Proxy (FRP), a tool that can expose a local server that is sitting behind an NAT or firewall to
the internet. This drops a legitimate Microsoft Edge update file:
%TEMP%\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe
Another file, %TEMP%\msedgeupdate.dll, is then seen on victim machines. But this file is
actually Meterpreter, a tool that is part of the Metasploit framework and which can be used
for remote access.
Other tools that were subsequently seen on this victim’s network included:
1/7

Gogo scanning tool: An automated scanning engine originally designed for use by
red teams.
Process Dumper (lsass.exe): A tool that allows attackers to dump domain
passwords.
Cobalt Strike Beacon: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands,
inject other processes, elevate current processes, or impersonate other processes, and
upload and download files. It ostensibly has legitimate uses as a penetration testing tool
but is invariably exploited by malicious actors.
AlliN scanning tool: A pentesting scan tool that can be used for lateral penetration of
the intranet.
Fscan: A publicly available hacktool that can scan for open ports and more.
Dogz proxy tool: A free VPN proxy tool.
A shellcode loader and a corrupted portable executable (PE) file were also deployed on this
victim’s network.
Other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed being used in this campaign
included:
SoftEtherVPN: The presence of this tool was what first prompted Symantec
researchers to investigate this activity. It is free, open-source, and cross-platform VPN
software.
Procdump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes
and generating crash dumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump
utility.
BrowserGhost: A publicly available tool that can grab passwords from an internet
browser.
Gost proxy: A tunneling tool.
Ntlmrelay: An NTLM relay attack allows an attacker to intercept validated
authentication requests in order to access network services.
Task Scheduler: Allows tasks to be automated on a computer.
Go-strip: Used to make a Go binary smaller in size.
HackBrowserData: An open-source tool that can decrypt browser data.
The tools deployed by Hydrochasma indicate a desire to achieve persistent and stealthy
access to victim machines, as well as an effort to escalate privileges and spread laterally
across victim networks.
While Symantec researchers didn’t observe data being exfiltrated from victim machines,
some of the tools deployed by Hydrochasma do allow for remote access and could potentially
be used to exfiltrate data. The sectors targeted also point towards the motivation behind this
attack being intelligence gathering.

2/7

The lack of custom malware used in this attack is also notable. Relying exclusively on livingoff-the-land and publicly available tools can help make an attack stealthier, while also
making attribution more difficult. Symantec did not see evidence to link this activity to a
known actor, prompting us to create the new actor identity of Hydrochasma for those behind
this activity.

Indicators of Compromise
If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect
and block that file.
