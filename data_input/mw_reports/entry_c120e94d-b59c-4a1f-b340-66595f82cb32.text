You can download the malware sample from malware-traffic-analysis.net

Stage 1
The main function is full of junk instructions, the most interesting function inside the main is
decode_n_call function near the end:

1/20

Inside the decode_n_call function, it allocated memory, decodes a data from 0x0433220
address and jumps to it via call instruction:

2/20

3/20

It allocates two memory blocks, each 0x3000 length, with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
permission:

After that, it writes some decoded data inside the first allocated memory:

4/20

Also, there is another loop which decodes/decrypts once again the written data in the
memory:

5/20

Seems like it’s PE file, but still encoded, not valid yet.
Function 0x30A70 gets two arguments, the encoded/encrypted data and the second
allocated memory, the function returns a decoded/decrypted PE file via the second
argument:

6/20

It removes the main executable from the memory and copies recently decoded/decrypted
code:

7/20

Section maps:

8/20

Inside 0x30730 (offset 0x730 ) function it build IAT for the new PE file:

9/20

After that, it jumps to the entry point of the new PE file:

10/20

Instead of continuing analysis, it’s much easier to dump the new PE and analyze it
separately.

Stage 2
The second PE is full of junk instructions, too. The interesting part starts at 0x0401EED
location.

Inside the sub_403B10 function, it tries to delete Settings , Microsoft\\Enc , AMMYY ,
Foundation and Foundation1 directories, also following files: wmihost.exe ,
settings3.bin , wmites.exe , wsus from different directories:

11/20

It uses sub_404450 to get a function addresses based on some kind of hash, which is
passed via the second argument:

The 0x403DE0 function gets process name as the argument and terminates the
corresponding process:

12/20

It executes following commands using ShellExecuteW function: cmd /C net.exe stop
ammyy , cmd /C sc delete ammyy , cmd /C net.exe stop foundation and cmd /C
sc delete foundation

13/20

These commands stop the malware if there is one.
It generates random name (via CoCreateGuid ) for a PE file, which it downloads from
http://185.176.221.29/ban3.dat :

14/20

Inside downloadNextStage_bin function, it downloads a file from the URL and saves at
above-mentionshed location:

It copies the new file to CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\Microsoft Help\\wsus.exe and deletes
original one:

15/20

Inside sub_402960 function if the user is an admin , it executes above-mentioned
commands once again, registers the downloaded PE file as a service called foundation
and starts it:

16/20

In the end, it deletes the original, second stage PE file:

17/20

If the user is not an admin , it uses a COM object ( taskscd.dll ) to create and run the
executable (via scheduled task ):

18/20

For the more detailed information look at sub_402360 function.
After that, same happens, it deletes the original, second stage PE file and exist via
TerminateProcess call:

That’s all.
That was the brief overview of the AMMYY RAT Downloader .
