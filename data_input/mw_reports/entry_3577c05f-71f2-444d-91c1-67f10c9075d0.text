Summary
Actions You Can Take Now to Protect Against BlackMatter Ransomware
• Implement and enforce backup and restoration policies and procedures.
• Use strong, unique passwords.
• Use multi-factor authentication.
• Implement network segmentation and traversal monitoring.
Note: this advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all
referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory was developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security
Agency (NSA) to provide information on BlackMatter ransomware. Since July 2021,
BlackMatter ransomware has targeted multiple U.S. critical infrastructure entities, including
two U.S. Food and Agriculture Sector organizations.
This advisory provides information on cyber actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
obtained from a sample of BlackMatter ransomware analyzed in a sandbox environment as
well from trusted third-party reporting. Using embedded, previously compromised
credentials, BlackMatter leverages the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and
Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to access the Active Directory (AD) to discover all
hosts on the network. BlackMatter then remotely encrypts the hosts and shared drives as
they are found.
Ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure entities could directly affect consumer
access to critical infrastructure services; therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA urge all
organizations, including critical infrastructure organizations, to implement the
recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this joint advisory. These mitigations will
help organizations reduce the risk of compromise from BlackMatter ransomware attacks.

Technical Details
Overview

1/8

First seen in July 2021, BlackMatter is ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) tool that allows the
ransomware's developers to profit from cybercriminal affiliates (i.e., BlackMatter actors) who
deploy it against victims. BlackMatter is a possible rebrand of DarkSide, a RaaS which was
active from September 2020 through May 2021. BlackMatter actors have attacked numerous
U.S.-based organizations and have demanded ransom payments ranging from $80,000 to
$15,000,000 in Bitcoin and Monero.
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
This advisory provides information on cyber actor TTPs obtained from the following sample
of BlackMatter ransomware, which was analyzed in a sandbox environment, as well as from
trusted third parties: SHA-256:
706f3eec328e91ff7f66c8f0a2fb9b556325c153a329a2062dc85879c540839d . (Note: click
here to see the sample’s page on VirusTotal.)
The BlackMatter variant uses embedded admin or user credentials that were previously
compromised and NtQuerySystemInformation and EnumServicesStatusExW to
enumerate running processes and services, respectively. BlackMatter then uses the
embedded credentials in the LDAP and SMB protocol to discover all hosts in the AD and the
srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) function to
enumerate each host for accessible shares. Notably, this variant of BlackMatter leverages
the embedded credentials and SMB protocol to remotely encrypt, from the original
compromised host, all discovered shares’ contents, including ADMIN$ , C$ , SYSVOL , and
NETLOGON .
BlackMatter actors use a separate encryption binary for Linux-based machines and routinely
encrypt ESXi virtual machines. Rather than encrypting backup systems, BlackMatter actors
wipe or reformat backup data stores and appliances.
Table 1 maps BlackMatter’s capabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework,
based on the analyzed variant and trusted third-party reporting.

Mitigations
CISA, the FBI, and NSA urge network defenders, especially for critical infrastructure
organizations, to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by
BlackMatter ransomware:
Implement Detection Signatures
Implement the detection signatures identified above. These signatures will identify
and block placement of the ransom note on the first share that is encrypted,
subsequently blocking additional SMB traffic from the encryptor system for 24 hours.
Use Strong Passwords
Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin
accounts, and domain admin accounts.) to have strong, unique passwords.
Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system
where an adversary may have access. Note: devices with local administrative
accounts should implement a password policy that requires strong, unique passwords
for each individual administrative account.
Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
Require multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly
for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.
Patch and Update Systems
Keep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the
most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its
exposure to cybersecurity threats.
Limit Access to Resources over the Network
4/8

Remove unnecessary access to administrative shares, especially ADMIN$ and
C$ . If ADMIN$ and C$ are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to
only the necessary service or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for
anomalous activity.
Use a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via SMB
from a limited set of administrator machines.
Implement Network Segmentation and Traversal Monitoring
Adversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility
and mapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment,
limit common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions.
Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can
help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and
access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral
movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are
particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common
and uncommon network connections for each host.
Use Admin Disabling Tools to Support Identity and Privileged Access Management
If BlackMatter uses compromised credentials during non-business hours, the compromise
may not be detected. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware
attacks during non-business hours, especially holidays and weekends, CISA, the FBI, and
NSA recommend organizations:
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin-level and higher. For
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when
needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the
Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to
automatically disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct
need. When the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through an
automated process that enables access to a system, but only for a set timeframe to
support task completion.
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege
escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the
command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty
escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.
Implement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures
5/8

Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This
practice will ensure the organization will not be severely interrupted, have irretrievable
data, or be held up by a ransom demand.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted)
and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.
CISA, the FBI, and NSA urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the following
additional mitigations to reduce the risk of credential compromise.
Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.
Consider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager
(NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.
Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft:
Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows
Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).
Minimize the AD attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity. Malicious
activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ Ticket Granting service
and can be used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.
Set a strong password policy for service accounts.
Audit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service
requests and ensure the events are monitored for anomalous activity.
Refer to the CISA-Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware
Guide for general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by
ransomware attacks.
Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational
technology networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-131A:
DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from
Ransomware Attacks for more mitigations, including mitigations to reduce the risk of severe
business or functional degradation should their entity fall victim to a ransomware attack.

Responding to Ransomware Attacks
If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend:
Following the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
Scanning backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check
that it is free of malware.
Reporting incidents immediately to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office, CISA at uscert.cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret Service Field Office.

6/8

Applying incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical
Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and
the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United
Kingdom.
Note: CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors.
Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage
other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit
activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.

Resources
