March 24, 2022 update – As Microsoft continues to track DEV-0537’s activities, tactics, and
tools, we’re sharing new detection, hunting, and mitigation information to give you additional
insights on remaining vigilant against these attacks.
In recent weeks, Microsoft Security teams have been actively tracking a large-scale social
engineering and extortion campaign against multiple organizations with some seeing
evidence of destructive elements. As this campaign has accelerated, our teams have been
focused on detection, customer notifications, threat intelligence briefings, and sharing with
our industry collaboration partners to understand the actor’s tactics and targets. Over time,
we have improved our ability to track this actor and helped customers minimize the impact of
active intrusions and in some cases worked with impacted organizations to stop attacks prior
to data theft or destructive actions. Microsoft is committed to providing visibility into the
malicious activity we’ve observed and sharing insights and knowledge of actor tactics that
1/14

might be useful for other organizations to protect themselves. While our investigation into the
most recent attacks is still in progress, we will continue to update this blog when we have
more to share.
The activity we have observed has been attributed to a threat group that Microsoft tracks as
DEV-0537, also known as LAPSUS$. DEV-0537 is known for using a pure extortion and
destruction model without deploying ransomware payloads. DEV-0537 started targeting
organizations in the United Kingdom and South America but expanded to global targets,
including organizations in government, technology, telecom, media, retail, and healthcare
sectors. DEV-0537 is also known to take over individual user accounts at cryptocurrency
exchanges to drain cryptocurrency holdings.
Unlike most activity groups that stay under the radar, DEV-0537 doesn’t seem to cover its
tracks. They go as far as announcing their attacks on social media or advertising their intent
to buy credentials from employees of target organizations. DEV-0537 also uses several
tactics that are less frequently used by other threat actors tracked by Microsoft. Their tactics
include phone-based social engineering; SIM-swapping to facilitate account takeover;
accessing personal email accounts of employees at target organizations; paying employees,
suppliers, or business partners of target organizations for access to credentials and
multifactor authentication (MFA) approval; and intruding in the ongoing crisis-communication
calls of their targets.
The social engineering and identity-centric tactics leveraged by DEV-0537 require detection
and response processes that are similar to insider risk programs–but also involve short
response timeframes needed to deal with malicious external threats. In this blog, we compile
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) we’ve observed across multiple attacks and
compromises. We also provide baseline risk mitigation strategies and recommendations to
help organizations harden their organization’s security against this unique blend of tradecraft.

Analysis
The actors behind DEV-0537 focused their social engineering efforts to gather knowledge
about their target’s business operations. Such information includes intimate knowledge about
employees, team structures, help desks, crisis response workflows, and supply chain
relationships. Examples of these social engineering tactics include spamming a target user
with multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts and calling the organization’s help desk to
reset a target’s credentials.
Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) assesses that the objective of DEV-0537 is to
gain elevated access through stolen credentials that enable data theft and destructive
attacks against a targeted organization, often resulting in extortion. Tactics and objectives
indicate this is a cybercriminal actor motivated by theft and destruction.

2/14

While this actor’s TTPs and infrastructure are constantly changing and evolving, the following
sections provide additional details on the very diverse set of TTPs we have observed that
DEV-0537 is using.

Initial access
DEV-0537 uses a variety of methods that are typically focused on compromising user
identities to gain initial access to an organization including:
Deploying the malicious Redline password stealer to obtain passwords and session
tokens
Purchasing credentials and session tokens from criminal underground forums
Paying employees at targeted organizations (or suppliers/business partners) for access
to credentials and MFA approval
Searching public code repositories for exposed credentials
Using the compromised credentials and/or session tokens, DEV-0537 accesses internetfacing systems and applications. These systems most commonly include virtual private
network (VPN), remote desktop protocol (RDP), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) including
Citrix, or identity providers (including Azure Active Directory, Okta). For organizations using
MFA security, DEV-0537 used two main techniques to satisfy MFA requirements–session
token replay and using stolen passwords to trigger simple-approval MFA prompts hoping that
the legitimate user of the compromised account eventually consents to the prompts and
grants the necessary approval.
In some cases, DEV-0537 first targeted and compromised an individual’s personal or private
(non-work-related) accounts giving them access to then look for additional credentials that
could be used to gain access to corporate systems. Given that employees typically use these
personal accounts or mobile phone numbers as their second-factor authentication or
password recovery, the group would often use this access to reset passwords and complete
account recovery actions.
Microsoft also found instances where the group successfully gained access to target
organizations through recruited employees (or employees of their suppliers or business
partners). DEV-0537 advertised that they wanted to buy credentials for their targets to entice
employees or contractors to take part in its operation. For a fee, the willing accomplice must
provide their credentials and approve the MFA prompt or have the user install AnyDesk or
other remote management software on a corporate workstation allowing the actor to take
control of an authenticated system. Such a tactic was just one of the ways DEV-0537 took
advantage of the security access and business relationships their target organizations have
with their service providers and supply chains.

network
In other observed activity, DEV-0537 actors performed a SIM-swapping attack to access a
user’s phone number before signing into the corporate network. This method allows the
actors to handle phone-based authentication prompts they need to gain access to a target.
Once standard user credentials or access was obtained, DEV-0537 typically connected a
system to an organization’s VPN. In some cases, to meet conditional access requirements,
DEV-0537 registered or joined the system to the organization’s Azure Active Directory (Azure
AD).

Reconnaissance and privilege escalation
Once DEV-0537 obtained access to the target network using the compromised account, they
used multiple tactics to discover additional credentials or intrusion points to extend their
access including:

4/14

Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities on internally accessible servers including JIRA,
Gitlab, and Confluence
Searching code repositories and collaboration platforms for exposed credentials and
secrets
They have been consistently observed to use AD Explorer, a publicly available tool, to
enumerate all users and groups in the said network. This allows them to understand which
accounts might have higher privileges. They then proceeded to search collaboration
platforms like SharePoint or Confluence, issue-tracking solutions like JIRA, code repositories
like GitLab and GitHub, and organization collaboration channels like Teams or Slack to
discover further high-privilege account credentials to access other sensitive information.
DEV-0537 is also known to exploit vulnerabilities in Confluence, JIRA, and GitLab for
privilege escalation. The group compromised the servers running these applications to get
the credentials of a privileged account or run in the context of the said account and dump
credentials from there. The group used DCSync attacks and Mimikatz to perform privilege
escalation routines. Once domain administrator access or its equivalent has been obtained,
the group used the built-in ntdsutil utility to extract the AD database.
In some cases, DEV-0537 even called the organization’s help desk and attempted to
convince the support personnel to reset a privileged account’s credentials. The group used
the previously gathered information (for example, profile pictures) and had a native-Englishsounding caller speak with the help desk personnel to enhance their social engineering lure.
Observed actions have included DEV-0537 answering common recovery prompts such as
“first street you lived on” or “mother’s maiden name” to convince help desk personnel of
authenticity. Since many organizations outsource their help desk support, this tactic attempts
to exploit those supply chain relationships, especially where organizations give their help
desk personnel the ability to elevate privileges.

Exfiltration, destruction, and extortion
Based on our observation, DEV-0537 has dedicated infrastructure they operate in known
virtual private server (VPS) providers and leverage NordVPN for its egress points. DEV-0537
is aware of detections such as impossible travel and thus picked VPN egress points that
were geographically like their targets. DEV-0537 then downloaded sensitive data from the
targeted organization for future extortion or public release to the system joined to the
organization’s VPN and/or Azure AD-joined system.
DEV-0537 has been observed leveraging access to cloud assets to create new virtual
machines within the target’s cloud environment, which they use as actor-controlled
infrastructure to perform further attacks across the target organization.

5/14

If they successfully gain privileged access to an organization’s cloud tenant (either AWS or
Azure), DEV-0537 creates global admin accounts in the organization’s cloud instances, sets
an Office 365 tenant level mail transport rule to send all mail in and out of the organization to
the newly created account, and then removes all other global admin accounts, so only the
actor has sole control of the cloud resources, effectively locking the organization out of all
access. After exfiltration, DEV-0537 often deletes the target’s systems and resources. We’ve
observed deletion of resources both on-premises (for example, VMware vSphere/ESXi) and
in the cloud to trigger the organization’s incident and crisis response process.
The actor has been observed then joining the organization’s crisis communication calls and
internal discussion boards (Slack, Teams, conference calls, and others) to understand the
incident response workflow and their corresponding response. It is assessed this provides
DEV-0537 insight into the victim’s state of mind, their knowledge of the intrusion, and a
venue to initiate extortion demands. Notably, DEV-0537 has been observed joining incident
response bridges within targeted organizations responding to destructive actions. In some
cases, DEV-0537 has extorted victims to prevent the release of stolen data, and in others, no
extortion attempt was made and DEV-0537 publicly leaked the data they stole.

Impact
Early observed attacks by DEV-0537 targeted cryptocurrency accounts resulting in
compromise and theft of wallets and funds. As they expanded their attacks, the actors began
targeting telecommunication, higher education, and government organizations in South
America. More recent campaigns have expanded to include organizations globally spanning
a variety of sectors. Based on observed activity, this group understands the interconnected
nature of identities and trust relationships in modern technology ecosystems and targets
telecommunications, technology, IT services and support companies–to leverage their
access from one organization to access the partner or supplier organizations. They have
also been observed targeting government entities, manufacturing, higher education, energy,
retailers, and healthcare.
Microsoft will continue to monitor DEV-0537 activity and implement protections for our
customers. The current detections and advanced detections in place across our security
products are detailed in the following sections.

Actor actions targeting Microsoft
This week, the actor made public claims that they had gained access to Microsoft and
exfiltrated portions of source code. No customer code or data was involved in the observed
activities. Our investigation has found a single account had been compromised, granting
limited access. Our cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the
compromised account and prevent further activity. Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of
code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation of risk. The
tactics DEV-0537 used in this intrusion reflect the tactics and techniques discussed in this
6/14

blog. Our team was already investigating the compromised account based on threat
intelligence when the actor publicly disclosed their intrusion. This public disclosure escalated
our action allowing our team to intervene and interrupt the actor mid-operation, limiting
broader impact.

Recommendations
Strengthen MFA implementation
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is one of the primary lines of defense against DEV-0537.
While this group attempts to identify gaps in MFA, it remains a critical pillar in identity security
for employees, vendors, and other personnel alike. See the following recommendations to
implement MFA more securely:
Do:
Require MFA for all users coming from all locations including perceived trusted
environments, and all internet-facing infrastructure–even those coming from onpremises systems.
Leverage more secure implementations such as FIDO Tokens, or Microsoft
Authenticator with number matching. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid
risks associated with SIM-jacking.
Use Azure AD Password Protection to ensure that users aren’t using easily guessed
passwords. Our blog about password spray attacks outlines additional
recommendations.
Leverage passwordless authentication methods such as Windows Hello for Business,
Microsoft Authenticator, or FIDO tokens to reduce risks and user experience issues
associated with passwords.
Implement user and sign-in risk-based policies that block high impact user actions like
device enrollment and MFA registration.
Break glass accounts should be stored offline and not be present in any sort of online
password vaulting solution.
Use automated reports and workbooks such as Azure Monitor workbooks for reports
for detailed analysis on risk distribution, risk detection trends, and opportunities for risk
remediation.
Remind employees that enterprise or workplace credentials should not be stored in
browsers or password vaults secured with personal credentials
Do NOT:
Use weak MFA factors such as text messages (susceptible to SIM swapping), simple
voice approvals, simple push (instead, use number matching), or secondary email
addresses.

7/14

Include location-based exclusions. MFA exclusions allow an actor with only one factor
for a set of identities to bypass the MFA requirements if they can fully compromise a
single identity.
Allow credential or MFA factor sharing between users.

Require healthy and trusted endpoints
Require trusted, compliant, and healthy devices for access to resources to prevent data
theft.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus to cover rapidly
evolving attacker tools and techniques, block new and unknown malware variants, and
enhance attack surface reduction rules and tamper protection.

Leverage modern authentication options for VPNs
VPN authentication should leverage modern authentication options such as OAuth or SAML
connected to Azure AD to enable risk-based sign-in detection. Modern authentication
enables blocking authentication attempts based on sign-in risk, requiring compliant devices
for sign in, and tighter integration with your authentication stack to provide more accurate risk
detections. Implementation of modern authentication and tight conditional access policies on
VPN has been shown to be effective against DEV-0537’s access tactics.

Strengthen and monitor your cloud security posture
DEV-0537 leverages legitimate credentials to perform malicious actions against customers.
Since these credentials are legitimate, some activity performed might seem consistent with
standard user behavior. Use the following recommendations to improve your cloud security
posture:
Review your Conditional Access user and session risk configurations:
Block or force password reset for high/medium user risk for all users
Block high sign-in risk logins for all users
Block medium sign-in risk logins for privileged users
Require MFA for medium sign-in risk logins for all other users
Alerts should be configured to prompt a review on high-risk modification of tenant
configuration, including but not limited to:
Modification of Azure AD roles and privileged users associated with those roles
Creation or modification of Exchange Online transport rules
Modification of tenant-wide security configurations
Review risk detections in Azure AD Identity Protection
Risk detections highlight risky users and risky sign-ins
Administrators can review and confirm individual sign-ins listed here as
compromised or safe

Improve awareness of social engineering attacks
Microsoft recommends raising and improving awareness of social engineering tactics to
protect your organization. Educate members of your technical team to watch out for and
report any unusual contacts with colleagues. IT help desks should be hypervigilant about
suspicious users and ensure that they are tracked and reported immediately. We recommend
reviewing help desk policies for password resets for highly privileged users and executives to
take social engineering into consideration.
Embed a culture of security awareness in your organization by educating employees about
help desk verification practices. Encourage them to report suspicious or unusual contacts
from the help desk. Education is the number one defense against social engineering attacks
such as this one and it is important to make sure that all employees are aware of the risks
and known tactics.

Establish operational security processes in response to DEV-0537 intrusions
DEV-0537 is known to monitor and intrude in incident response communications. As such,
these communication channels should be closely monitored for unauthorized attendees and
verification of attendees should be performed visually or audibly.
We advise organizations to follow very tight operational security practices when responding
to an intrusion believed to be DEV-0537. Organizations should develop an out-of-band
communication plan for incident responders that is usable for multiple days while an
investigation occurs. Documentation of this response plan should be closely held and not
easily accessible.
Microsoft continues to track DEV-0537’s activities, tactics, malware, and tools. We will
communicate any additional insights and recommendations as we investigate their actions
against our customers.

Detecting, hunting, and responding to DEV-0537 activities
Microsoft security products provide several detections that can help identify activities
resembling DEV-0537 tactics. We’re also sharing several Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft
Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Sentinel hunting and detection queries that are

9/14

linked in the following sections. We suggest reviewing the following detections and using the
highlighted queries to enhance the investigation of potential activity in your environment.

Initial access
Microsoft Sentinel hunting queries
Sign-in from VPS providers – This query looks for successful sign-ins from known VPS
provider network ranges with suspicious token-based sign-in patterns. This is not an
exhaustive list of VPS provider ranges but covers some of the most prevalent providers
observed.
Investigate unknown sign-in attempts from uncommon or unusual VPS providers.
Sign-in activity from NordVPN providers – This query looks for sign-in activity from NordVPN
providers using the feed leveraging NordVPN API and is updated daily.
Investigate unknown sign-in attempts from VPN providers such as NordVPN unless it is
commonly seen in your organization.
User sign-in IP address teleportation – This query looks at sign-in logs to identify user
accounts that have signed in from two different countries or regions within a specified time
window. By default, this is a 10-minute window either side of the previous sign-in.
Investigate the users signing in from multiple locations within a short span of time. It might
detect users roaming onto VPNs. You can also exclude known VPN IP address ranges in the
query.

Reconnaissance
Microsoft 365 Defender built-in detection: Multiple searches for sensitive data in
SharePoint sites
This detection looks for instances where a user searched for sensitive data on SharePoint
sites that an attacker can use as internal information to leverage in later attacks if the user’s
account is compromised.
Investigate the user account performing the queries to determine if it was compromised.
Determine what, if any, sensitive information was accessed to assess the impact.
Note: Data used in this detection requires advanced audit to be enabled in Microsoft
Defender 365 that includes the SearchQueryInitiatedSharePoint event type.

Privilege escalation
Microsoft 365 Defender built-in detection: Risky user created global admin

10/14

This detection will alert users based on the risk score proved by Azure AD Identity Protection
when a new global admin was created by a user that had a risky sign-in. An attacker might
have compromised the user account to perform lateral movement.
Investigate the new global admin account to determine if it was created legitimately and if the
user account that performed the action was compromised.
Microsoft 365 Defender hunting queries
Multiple admin role removal operations done by a single user – This query looks for multiple
users that had their administrator role removed by a single user within a certain period.
Investigate if the user account that removed the admin roles was compromised or if the
actions were legitimate. If determined to be compromised, disable the account and reset the
password. Restore access to affected accounts as needed.
‘ElevateAccess’ operation followed risky sign-in – This query looks for users who had a risky
sign-in (based on Azure AD Identity Protection risk score) and then performed an
‘ElevateAccess’ action. ‘ElevateAccess’ operations can be used by global admins to obtain
permissions over Azure resources.
Investigate the risky sign-ins and the following ‘ElevateAccess’ operation and disable the
account if it was determined to be compromised.
Microsoft Sentinel hunting queries
User-assigned privileged role – This query identifies when a new privileged role is assigned
to a user or when any account eligible for a role is given privileged access.
Investigate if the assignment of privileged access is unexpected or does not align to the role
of the account holder. See Things to monitor in your security operations for privileged
accounts for details.
User added to Azure AD privileged groups (near real-time (NRT) rule) – This query looks for
instances when a user is added to any privileged groups.
Investigate any unusual additions to privileged groups, particularly administrator roles. For
details, see Azure AD audit activity reference and administrator role permissions in Azure
AD.
Multiple admin membership removals from newly created admin – This query detects when
newly created global admin removes multiple existing global admins which can be an
attempt by adversaries to lock down the organization and retain sole access.
Investigate reasoning and intention of multiple membership removal by new global admins
and take necessary actions accordingly.
11/14

For Microsoft Sentinel customers who have onboarded Okta logs, the following queries can
assist in investigating DEV-0537 activity across those logs:
Microsoft Sentinel + Okta logs hunting queries
Admin privilege granted (Okta) – This query searches for successful grant of administrator
permissions to user/groups. Adversaries often attempt to assign administrator permission to
users/group to maintain access as well as to elevate privileges.
Verify the behavior is known and filter out any expected activity and triage unknown. See
Okta API event types for details.
Create API token (Okta) – This query searches for attempts to create new API token. Okta
API tokens are used to authenticate requests to Okta APIs.
Investigate attempts to create new API token creation or authentication attempts. See Okta
API event types for details.
Initiate impersonation session (Okta) – This query searches for impersonation events used in
LAPSUS$ activity. User.session.impersonation are rare events, normally triggered when an
Okta Support person requests admin access for troubleshooting.
Review user.session.impersonation events and correlate that with legitimate opened Okta
support tickets to determine if these are anomalous. See Okta API event types and
Cloudflare’s investigation of the January 2022 Okta compromise for details.
Rare MFA operations (Okta) – MFA helps prevent credential compromise. This query
searches for rare MFA operations like deactivating, updating, resetting, and attempts to
bypass MFA.
Adversaries often attempt these operations to compromise networks and high-value
accounts.
Verify that the behavior is known and filter out anything that is expected. See Okta API event
types for details.

Persistence
Microsoft 365 Defender hunting queries
Device registration after risky sign-in – This query looks for a new device registration in
Azure AD preceded by a medium or high-risk sign-in session for the same user within a
maximum of six hours.
Investigate the user account to determine if it is compromised. Disable user account, reset
user password, and remove devices registered in Azure AD if compromised.
12/14

MFA method added after risky sign-in – This query looks for a new MFA method added to an
account that was preceded by a medium or high-risk sign-in session for the same user within
a maximum of six hours.
Investigate the user account to determine if it is compromised. If compromised, disable the
user account, reset user password, and remove the MFA method added by threat actor.

Exfiltration, destruction, and extortion
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps built-in detection: Delete multiple VMs in a single
session
This detection profiles your environment and triggers alerts when users delete multiple VMs
in a single session, relative to the baseline in your organization. This might indicate an
attempted breach.
Investigate the user account performing the deletion operations to determine if it was
compromised or if the activities were performed legitimately and not part of a destructive
attack.
Microsoft 365 Defender query
Upload multiple code repositories to external cloud domains – This query looks for accounts
that uploaded multiple code repositories to external web domain.
Investigate if the accounts are compromised. If compromised, disable the accounts and reset
the passwords. Assess the impact of what information was obtained, looking for any
passwords, secrets, certificates, and others that the attacker might be able to leverage.
Note: This query uses ‘FileUploadedToCloud’ event which is only available for customers
that enabled Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Apps. See Integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Defender for Cloud Apps for
details)
Microsoft Sentinel hunting queries
Mass cloud resource deletions time series anomalies – This query generates baseline
pattern of cloud resource deletions by a user and alert on an anomaly when any unusual
spike is detected.
Investigate the anomalies from unusual or privileged users, they could be indication of a
cloud infrastructure takedown by an adversary.
Mail redirect via ExO transport rule – This query identifies when Exchange Online transport
rule configured to forward emails.

13/14

Investigate detections to determine if a malicious actor has configured a new mailbox to
collect mail from multiple user accounts.
Time series anomaly for data size transferred to public internet – This query identifies
anomalous or unusual data transfers to public networks. This detection identifies large
deviations from a baseline pattern based on detection algorithms from the Sentinelintegrated Kusto Query Language (KQL) anomaly detection. The higher the score, the
further it is from the baseline value. The output is aggregated to provide a summary view of
unique source IP to destination IP address and port bytes sent traffic observed in the flagged
anomaly hour. The source IP addresses which were sending less than
bytessentperhourthreshold have been excluded, the value of which can be adjusted as
needed. You might have to run queries for individual source IP addresses from SourceIPlist
to determine if anything looks suspicious. Investigate any sudden increase in data
transferred to unknown public networks as an indication of data exfiltration attempts.
