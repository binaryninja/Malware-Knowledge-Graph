CRASHOVERRIDE: Reassessing the 2016 Ukraine
Electric Power Event as a Protection-Focused Attack
By Joe Slowik, Dragos Inc

Abstract
Upon discovery and initial analysis in mid-2017, audiences primarily viewed CRASHOVERRIDE
as a disruptive event targeting electric utility operations in Ukraine. Similar to the 2015 attack in
the same area, CRASHOVERRIDE interrupted the flow of electricity by manipulating ICS
equipment and delayed recovery operations to prolong the impact.
However, CRASHOVERRIDE’s immediate effects represent only the precursors for an attempt
at a more ambitious attack than what was achieved. In addition to significantly expanded
scope in power disruption, CRASHOVERRIDE differentiates itself from the 2015 event
by attempting to disable protective relay devices involved in the targeted operations
through a denial of service (DoS) attack. The attack as implemented failed, but the most-likely
intention behind this action and its implications for electric utility operations and protection
have received little attention or analysis. This paper will reexamine this phase of the
CRASHOVERRIDE event and likely attacker intentions, even if actual execution
failed. It will highlight how CRASHOVERRIDE attempted a different type of attack
than 2015 by disrupting electric power operations only as an initial step toward setting
up a protection-focused attack on transmission operations, with disabling protective gear
as a final attack phase to introduce possible physical destruction via cyber means.

Introduction
On its public discovery in mid-2017, some analysts called CRASHOVERRIDE1 (also referred to as
Industroyer2) the “biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet”.3 While concerning, the
event’s initial impacts resulted in a smaller effect than the 2015 Ukraine electric event in terms of
number of customers impacted and for how long.4 Technically more sophisticated than the 2015
Ukrainian power outage due to industrial control system (ICS) manipulation codified in software rather
than deployed via manual interaction with systems, the seeming failure or lack of significant impact
caused some to discount the severity or significance of CRASHOVERRIDE.
In terms of achieved impact and effect, CRASHOVERRIDE represents a step back from the 2015
event. Yet in terms of ambition and intention, CRASHOVERRIDE sought to attain greater and more
serious impacts than 2015. Based on analysis of the various payloads, CRASHOVERRIDE attempted
to create a far more widespread outage than 2015 and stage a potential destructive event as the final
step in the attack sequence. Despite seemingly thorough analysis of CRASHOVERRIDE, including
in public presentations at events such as Black Hat,5 significant implications behind the event –
especially its intended scope and potential outcome – remain largely ignored.
In this paper, we will explore the CRASHOVERRIDE event from a different perspective. Instead of
looking at what happened at Ukrenergo station “North” in December 2016 following
CRASHOVERRIDE’s execution, we will explore what the attackers, identified as ELECTRUM,6 likely
sought to achieve given the design and configuration of software deployed in the victim environment.
Attackers made many mistakes in designing and deploying CRASHOVERRIDE and related impact
modules. However the scope and implications for this attack’s intentions are cause for deep concern
among electric utility operators. By exploring and understanding what CRASHOVERRIDE tried but
ultimately failed to achieve, relevant ICS asset owners and operators can prepare for better
instrumented and executed future attacks and prevent potentially destructive results.

CRASHOVERRIDE’s deployment and follow-on actions.8 A high-level review of CRASHOVERRIDE’s
execution is provided in Figure 1. Each of these reports and their analyses largely focus on observed
items following events at substation “North” in Ukrenergo. Although hewing to observed events, such
analysis neglects significant aspects of what the attacker likely sought to achieve in this attack but
failed to successfully execute.

Figure 1: CRASHOVERRIDE Event Attack Flow

CRASHOVERRIDE impacted electric transmission operations resulting in an outage of approximately
an hour in Kiev, Ukraine – noticeably smaller in both scale and duration than the 2015 attack.9 While
the 2015 event took place through manual manipulation of systems via compromised remote logons
to control system workstations, the 2016 event leveraged the CRASHOVERRIDE framework to
encode ICS manipulation within software. This aspect represents a significant development in
attacker tradecraft. Encoding ICS attacks in software enables the attack to scale far better than
manual system interaction. Reviewing log data and other artifacts associated with the
CRASHOVERRIDE event revealed that the intended scale of the attack was far larger than 2015 but
also significantly different from what attackers ultimately achieved.
CRASHOVERRIDE targeted electric transmission control systems across multiple communication
protocols – IEC-101,10 IEC-104,11 IEC-61850,12 and OPC-DA13 – with a very simple yet effective
objective: to change the physical state of breakers and related equipment from “closed” (allowing
power to flow) to “open.” There is some variation in effects in CRASHOVERRIDE. Options exist for a
direct state change to the flow of power or for “strobing,” meaning continuously switching between

states of open and closed. However, only immediate “open” and “close” effects appear to have been
used in the victim’s environment.
While seemingly a simple “on-off” switch in functionality, the implementation of these standards
requires more than a direct, one-step shift from one logical state to another for successful
communication and state alteration. Achieving actual physical manipulation of the targeted RTU or
other system requires logical messaging following discrete, required steps. An accurate
understanding of the specific protocol targeted – as well as the vendor’s actual implementation of the
protocol – requires knowing the “statefulness” of a given protocol’s communications for proper
interaction.14
Computer science includes a notion of statefulness for programming and communication, where
protocols can either be stateful or stateless. Stateful protocols are designed to record or consider
preceding events in the communication stream, while stateless events can ignore or need not
consider such items.15 As an example, TCP with its handshake and session management represents
a stateful protocol, whereas UDP streams are stateless in nature.
CRASHOVERRIDE’s functionality is based on a semi-modular construct where different effects
modules perform protocol-specific communications, usually executed from a common launcher.
Based on the implementation of CRASHOVERRIDE’s effects modules, the developers were either
unaware of or failed to properly implement appropriate stateful communications in their software for
specific ICS communication protocols. Although potentially indicative of either poor testing or
understanding of the targeted systems and underlying protocols, such errors are hardly rare or unique
given complex systems and varying vendor implementations of more general protocol standards. 16
One possibility for this error may be test environment. Protocol emulators in software, such as the
publicly-available IEC Server project,17 do not enforce statefulness and associated communication
timeouts. Physical hardware will employ such items in line with the vendor-specific implementations
of the relevant communication standard. As a result of either equipment limitations, error, or sheer
ignorance, the actual receiving system in the victim environment of CRASHOVERRIDE’s execution
would either reject the communication as invalid given improper implementation of stateful standards,
or ignore for similar reasons. The impact (or lack of effect) can be compared to an invalid TCP
handshake with the resulting absence of actual communication.

This aspect of CRASHOVERRIDE is important. When reviewing intended targeting within the victim
environment, the number of control systems identified for manipulation is large and more widespread
than the actual outage. Based on available data from the event, at least seven OPC servers with
multiple managed OPC instances each were targeted along with at least eight IEC-101 controllers
and over 400 control points for IEC-104 communication.18 Additionally, all observed instances of the
IEC-61850 attack module swept the local subnet for applicable hosts and attempted to disrupt based

on discovery, with the number of targets essentially equal to the number of such devices on the
impacted subnet. Based on this information and targeting intention, CRASHOVERRIDE attempted a
widespread outage across hundreds of individual control systems, aiming for a disruptive impact that
would be orders of magnitude larger than the 2015 event.
Essentially: ELECTRUM attempted to manipulate many systems via CRASHOVERRIDE to create a
widespread electric transmission disruption. Yet across all four protocols and all related systems
involved in controlling operations, the effect was relatively minimal in terms of actual outage and
quickly restored due to Ukrenergo’s ability to manually reclose impacted breakers. While ambitious in
scope and reach, CRASHOVERRIDE’s actual impact can be judged as a failure.
Yet simply stopping at ELECTRUM’s failure to successfully execute a widespread transmission
interruption obscures several interesting elements following attempted disruption operations. Similar
to the 2015 incident, CRASHOVERRIDE deployed a wiper module to impede recovery and (in this
specific case) delete configuration and related files to hamper restoration on infected SCADA
systems. This portion of the attack appears to have executed successfully, and produced a situation
where operators lost control and view over ICS operations in the environment. This is a non-trivial
impact as it limits the flexibility of remote operations and coordination, while potentially masking subtle
issues in the transmission environment given loss of remote view into operations.
The above wiper impact was then followed by an interesting action that was largely overlooked in
initial analysis: an attempted denial of service attack using a publicly-known vulnerability on four
Siemens SIPROTEC protective relays in the operating environment. At this point, ELECTRUM’s
attack sequence sought to de-energize transmission equipment, create a loss of control and loss of
view impact on SCADA systems controlling this equipment, and then aimed to remove relay protection
on the de-energized transmission lines. Given Ukrenergo’s ability and willingness to resort to manual
restoration operations, absent complete view into the ICS environment’s state, CRASHOVERRIDE
escalates from an immediate disruption of electric transmission to creating a potentially unstable or
unsafe system state at time of manual service restoration. To analyze and understand this aspect of
the 2016 Ukraine event and its significance, one must understand protective relays and their role in
electric operations.

Protective Relays in Electric Utility Operations
Protective relays play a vital role in electric utility operations. Protective relays use advanced
algorithms to protect transmission or generation equipment from harmful conditions. Ultimately, “the
function of protective relaying is to cause the prompt removal from service of any element of a power
system when it suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might
cause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system.” 19 Relay
locations are highlighted in the below diagram (Figure 2), relative to locations in electric generation,
transmission, and distribution operations.

Figure 2: Overview of Protective Relay Locations Relative to Electric Operations

Protective relays work to dynamically monitor the power system and clear or mitigate faults in the
system when detected. Modern digital protective relay systems perform a variety of diagnostic and
monitoring functions to make this possible. They identify items from current to voltage to frequency
and safeguard electric systems from anomalous, potentially destructive behavior, while providing
output and feedback to end users. A high-level overview of such activity is shown in Figure 3. Key to
digital relays is the ability to perform precisely the right action within incredibly small time increments
to preserve the integrity of the protected system.20

Figure 3: Protective Relay Representation21

Digital protective relays ensure grid stability through adverse but regularly observed, fluctuating
parameters.22 In the event of a direct, immediate event or attack, digital relays ensure resiliency by
disengaging equipment from the overall, now-compromised system. Specific relay technology exists
for both electric transmission (where relays protect and normalize the flow of electricity to transformers
and related equipment)23 and generation (where relays prevent potential swings in several factors,
including rotation frequency).24 Examples of protective relay applications include phase distance
protection for generating assets; initiating protection in event of breaker failure; transformer and
transmission system coordination to protect against overcurrent conditions; and protecting generator
assets against frequency abnormalities.25
Coordination among protected assets and grid components is necessary to ensure system-wide
stability in light of individual site protection actions.26 While protective relays work to isolate
transmission or generation from damage, such automated responses during times of electric system
stress or distributed disruption can create positive-feedback loops resulting in widespread
dislocation.27 In these extreme circumstances, widespread impacts are possible, such as the USCanada 2003 power event and the Italian blackout of 2003, irrespective of grid protection

mechanisms.28 In these cases, network effects in stressed systems result in widespread outages –
which although disruptive, are preferable to the potential loss of equipment and capacity that would
result from physical damage to overloaded or otherwise stressed equipment.
To highlight what happens when relays fail, the power outage impacting New York City in July 2019
originated in a distribution fault impacting substation after both primary and secondary relays failed to
isolate the faulted line.29 Improper wiring between system sensors and resident relays resulted in
relays failing to respond to the fault situation.30 In this case, failure in protective systems produced
site-specific physical damage and an unplanned outage impacting thousands of consumers. Had
relays functioned properly, the faulted line would have been isolated and de-energized, preserving
the functionality of the rest of the substation. Ultimately, when properly controlled and implemented,
protective relays ensure electric service stability and protect physical assets from a variety of natural
or unnatural fluctuations.

Post-CRASHOVERRIDE Effects
After interrupting the flow of electricity in the victim environment, CRASHOVERRIDE proceeds to a
combination loss of visibility- and loss of control-directed disruption. This is illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4: CRASHOVERRIDE Post-Disruption Effects

At first glance, the impact of the above sequence of events is felt primarily by service restoration and
recovery – manipulating SCADA/DCS devices to inhibit reboot and control and deleting configuration

files to deny speedy recovery. This series of events is non-trivial and tremendously disruptive, but as
indicated by Ukrainian response to the 2015 event, asset owners can and showed a willingness to
quickly move into manual system operations at impacted sites in order to restore impacted services
as quickly as possible. What sets the 2016 event apart in intention – if not in actual impact – was the
far-larger scale of disruption designed in the CRASHOVERRIDE effects modules, which as previously
described aimed to cause a very large-scale interruption in transmission services across hundreds of
devices.
The above widespread impact alone makes manual service restoration (in a scenario where the attack
succeeds as designed) difficult given the number of devices manipulated. Yet this is only a half-way
point in the overall attack logic, as the last stage of the sequence of events – functionally disabling the
SIPROTEC protective relays – is most interesting from both an operational and attack impact
assessment. In terms of attack progression, attackers performed a denial of service (DoS) against
protective relays after opening system breakers and removing operator visibility into system
operations through the wiper attack. Removing protection from an unenergized line at first seems
nonsensical as, at this stage, there is nothing to actually protect. But the real focus of impact instead
hinges on a combination of widespread transmission disruption combined with an assumption based
on previous observation of Ukrainian restoration operations that finds asset owners would move to
restore service as quickly as possible through manual means despite loss of visibility into actual
system status.
Attacking protective relays can quickly cause severe consequences including “islanding” events
related to grid self-protection actions and the potential for equipment damage due to faults absent
protection.31 However, it appears ELECTRUM in the CRASHOVERRIDE scenario (as designed)
aimed to create an unsafe, unstable condition for reconnected transmission lines at the moment of
physical restoration. In this scenario, manually closing breakers opens up the possibility of overcurrent
scenarios absent digital protection. The vulnerability targeted in the DoS executable, CVE-2015-5374,
performs a functional DoS as opposed to a network accessibility DoS.32 Given these conditions,
CRASHOVERRIDE evolves from an immediate disruption event to a delayed potential physical
destruction attack. As shown in Figure 5, the disruption of transmission through remote terminal unit
(RTU) manipulation is a precursor to a final, more serious stage: inhibiting protection systems so when
service is restored, the target circuit is no longer safe and is subject to damage.

Figure 5: CRASHOVERRIDE Attack Intentions

The DoS condition places the victim SIPROTEC device in “firmware update” mode. The effect
triggered is practical and useful in legitimate firmware update instances given the limited resources
available to legacy SIPROTEC devices (especially for memory). However, when activated, the
impacted SIPROTEC no longer performs designed protective functions – including overcurrent
protection33 – on the relevant transmission lines even if still present, powered on, and network
accessible. Essentially the receiving device is placed in an inoperative holding pattern for future
instructions. When triggered outside of normal or intended operations, this is a mission kill impact from
the perspective of the targeted SIPROTEC relay. The SIPROTEC is still present on the network but
no longer performing intended functions due to the exploit. The result is an unprotected link in electric
transmission, with normal safeguards disabled.
The exploit condition is triggered by a single crafted UDP packet to UDP 50000 with the byte sequence
shown in part in Figure 6. Sending this sequence will put SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact
devices before version 4.25 into the non-functional standby mode described in the previous
paragraph. Publicly-available exploit frameworks have incorporated this functionality, making it widelyaccessible to immature entities, albeit against older system versions.34

Although ELECTRUM properly implemented the DoS condition in a binary targeting SIPROTEC
devices within the Ukrenergo network, the adversary made a coding mistake in overall communication
implementation affecting the executable’s functionality. Specific IP addresses – presumably for four
SIPROTEC devices within the victim network – are hard-coded in the DoS binary employed in the
CRASHOVERRIDE event. Yet when executed, the addresses are read backwards during
communication socket creation. This is shown in Figure 7 with specific addresses obfuscated. While
all devices reside on the same subnet as other control systems targeted in CRASHOVERRIDE’s
manipulation of transmission systems, the lack of endian awareness in socket creation results in
nonsensical communications and makes the precise implementation of the SIPROTEC DoS in
CRASHOVERRIDE inert.

Figure 7: Packet Capture of Denial of Service Module Traffic

Implications for Protective Relay Denial of Service Attack
Assessing the intended state of events when the SIPROTEC devices were supposed to be disabled
reveals worrying ambitions. It highlights CRASHOVERRIDE as a deeply serious attack, albeit one
that failed in its goals due to various errors or mistakes noted earlier. Since ELECTRUM failed to
disable the protective relays used at the victim site and did not manipulate as many RTUs as intended,
understanding what the group was attempting to achieve is conjecture – but sufficient information
exists to make informed judgment on what the group’s ultimate goal was in 2016.
ELECTRUM disabled protective equipment after disconnecting breakers via logical means. Attackers
then deployed measures such as the service wiping and remapping to inhibit logical recovery, while
also rendering various SCADA devices non-functional eliminating accurate understanding,
diagnostics, and remote operations of the transmission site. According to analysis of the 2015 Ukraine
event, Ukrainian authorities possess and are willing to execute manual recovery procedures in the
event of emergencies in electric utility operations. While in a state of logical loss of view, protective
relays are still powered on and notionally active but the ability to ascertain their status is inhibited, if
not completely removed, given the overall status of the utility’s network during what was designed to
be a massive transmission and control disruption event. As such, operators are placed in a situation
where they attempt to restore operations to normal as quickly as possible in a degraded operational
environment without having an accurate picture of that environment’s current status – including the
functionality of protection systems on lines about to be reconnected.
When transmission equipment is reconnected to the overall electric utility network with no protective
relay in place, the range of potential outcomes is concerning, and expands the scope of impacts
beyond immediate transmission disruption. The most obvious potential effect, provided ELECTRUM
succeeded in its full-scale transmission interruption, is a surge when equipment is reconnected with

11

no protection in place. This scenario produces a possible overcurrent event on the reconnected line
with the potential (depending on other backup and physical protection systems) to cause physical
damage to transmission equipment. Given that CRASHOVERRIDE was designed to cause a massive
transmission disruption by manipulating hundreds of devices, manual reconnection (taking place at a
slower, more deliberate pace than what would be possible through normal SCADA operations)
essentially connects a few lines at a time, resulting in potential overcurrent on the handful of
reconnected lines during restoration. Normally, circumstances such as these would result in a fault
and recovery through relay protection. But given the attack design, such protections are removed from
operations allowing for potentially destructive scenarios to play out.
Of note, the above represents a most-likely ELECTRUM intention in executing the
CRASHOVERRIDE attack – but it is not clear that such an attack would be successful in an actual
operating environment. The presence of various system redundancies and physical protection
mechanisms may have mitigated against a potential destructive scenario at the Ukrenergo site. More
generally, impacts at a specific site will depend upon a litany of other factors – such as redundant
relays and the presence and functionality of backup protection devices – making generalization from
CRASHOVERRIDE to any transmission site difficult to impossible. However, the overall sequence of
events indicates clear intentions on the part of ELECTRUM to place the targeted transmission site
into an unsafe and potentially dangerous state. Given the intended (if unrealized) scale of
CRASHOVERRIDE’s impact to transmission operations, the potential load at time of reconnect would
have been significant, and potentially amenable to a scenario resulting in physical damage to
transmission equipment, producing a longer-lasting outage due to the need for repairs and
replacement gear.
The combination of de-energizing transmission, eliminating process view and control, disabling
protective systems, and knowing the victim’s recourse to manual restoration of operations identifies a
complex, multi-stage attack designed to do far more than simply interrupt the flow of electricity for a
limited period of time. Instead, analyzing CRASHOVERRIDE as it was designed shifts the event from
a largely logical, network-focused incident to the unique realm of cyber-induced, physical damage
events so far only successfully achieved by Stuxnet. If CRASHOVERRIDE worked as ELECTRUM
most likely intended, the potential outage would have been more widespread than 2015 given the
number of transmission devices targeted. Additionally, the duration of the outage may have stretched
to months or longer if disabling protection prior to system restoration yielded physical damage to
transmission operations. While the actual efficacy of CRASHOVERRIDE – even if it had worked as
intended – remains unclear given a myriad of other controls and safeguards in electric transmission,
the sequence of steps executed clearly demonstrates a more complex and concerning attack than
past electric service disruptions.

Lessons from CRASHOVERRIDE as a Protection Attack
Various pieces of CRASHOVERRIDE and artifacts associated with targeting suggest ELECTRUM’s
intentions exceeded the effects of the 2015 event, but they failed due to poor understanding or
implementation of ICS communication protocols within the victim’s environment. Even if all items
deployed worked as intended, fundamental aspects of electric transmission and substation design
may have prevented the scenario playing out as likely desired. However, focusing on ELECTRUM’s
failures obscures the worrying ambition behind CRASHOVERRIDE. By timing a transmission outage
with both a loss of control and loss of view attack and disabling protective relays on impacted circuits,

ELECTRUM aimed for a far more significant and long-lasting effect: physical degradation or
destruction of transmission equipment, with the desire to produce impacts lasting months instead of
hours.
ELECTRUM failed in its attack for various reasons, but the event still provides multiple, actionable
lessons to electric utility operators from generation to transmission to distribution. Operators must
recognize adversaries have moved beyond switching things off and employing some mechanisms to
delay recovery to targeting the fundamental protection systems underpinning electric utility operations.
This element of protection-focused attack is also observed in more recent events such as TRISIS.35
While both CRASHOVERRIDE and TRISIS failed in their execution (and may have both been
prevented by other safeguards within the targeted systems), they demonstrate clear intention and
willingness on the part of adversaries to expand operations in ICS environments to potential physically
destructive scenarios. The implications for such attacks are significant and severe. In the rush to
restore transmission in CRASHOVERRIDE, operators can inadvertently enable physical destruction
if attackers successfully subvert protection mechanisms and operator visibility into protection systems.
Quickly and accurately diagnosing ICS impacts and effectively responding to disruptive events
requires efforts to increase visibility, monitoring, and root cause analysis capability. In the case of
CRASHOVERRIDE, identifying the combination of breaker manipulation with protective relay
communication can alert asset owners that an adversary is attempting to set up the necessary
preconditions for a potential destructive event. This is an example of a threat behavior analytic
combining multiple observables that can be used to quickly detect, disposition, and respond to
sequences of events in ICS environments.36 In this fashion, the victim can properly grasp the scope
and potential implications of the outage given the detected sequence of events, allowing for a more
measured response than simply rushing to manually restore operations as quickly as possible – with
the possibility of producing an unsafe operating environment.

At an even higher level, detecting or responding to CRASHOVERRIDE effectively across the scope
of the ICS cyber kill chain of events necessary to actually enable and execute an attack yields even
more defensive possibilities. Marrying IT-centric information highlighting ELECTRUM’s penetration of
the control system network with subsequent ICS-specific communication can accelerate root cause
analysis of subsequent disruption events. This also provides operators with sufficient visibility and
knowledge (even absent disabled SCADA equipment) to identify the event as a likely coordinated
attack across multiple layers of grid operations. From this, utilities can take appropriate action and
caution in responding to events and restoring operations. Furthermore, the victim will then possess
knowledge on the full scope of the intrusion and subsequent attack, to ensure complete network
recovery and remediation to prevent a potential re-compromise of the environment.
Lastly, asset owners and operators may discount CRASHOVERRIDE’s and ELECTRUM’s aims,
given multiple failures in attack implementation and some fundamental misunderstandings of electric
utility operations and safeguards. Yet adopting such a stance is not only misguided, but dangerous.

in CRASHOVERRIDE sends a clear signal that adversaries continue to learn and evolve with each
attack. CRASHOVERRIDE itself may have fallen short of its intentions, but ELECTRUM (and other
adversaries) will learn from this event and adapt in future operations. CRASHOVERRIDE’s
shortcomings demonstrate the complexity and sophistication of cyber attacks on ICS networks to
produce physical impacts – but CRASHOVERRIDE’s existence clearly signals adversary intent and
desire to develop such capabilities. ICS asset owners and operators must take such attempts
seriously, and deploy defenses before attackers are able to deploy a fully-functional, ICS-aware attack
in the future.

Conclusion
CRASHOVERRIDE was a failure in operations, especially when viewed from the perspective of actual
impacts relative to the 2015 Ukraine power event. Yet further analysis of the event and its implications
reveals a far more complex, nuanced, and concerning attack than its precursor. Through an attempted
multi-stage manipulation of transmission operations, ICS visibility, and ultimately protection systems,
ELECTRUM sought to create the preconditions for a possible physically-destructive event when the
victim restored operations. While actual predictions of CRASHOVERRIDE’s impact had it worked
correctly is a matter of conjecture, the adversary’s intent appears clear after analyzing all stages of
the attack – establishing circumstances to create an unsafe, potentially destructive scenario within the
victim transmission equipment.
The victim in 2016 avoided a worst-case scenario. Moving forward, electric utility operators must be
aware of how adversaries executed this attack and its implications for operations. By adopting a
whole-of-attack approach to reviewing what ELECTRUM tried but failed to do, ICS asset owners and
operators can begin developing and deploying the required visibility, resilience, and response
measures needed to cope with an attack like CRASHOVERRIDE.
