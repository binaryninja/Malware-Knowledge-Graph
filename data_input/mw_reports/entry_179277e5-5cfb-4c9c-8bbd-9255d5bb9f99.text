Background and Key points
In the last two months, we observed, through our telemetries, an increase in the
number of Vultur infections among our customers.
At the beginning of October 2022, the Cleafy Threat Intelligence Team discovered and
reported to Google a dropper of Vultur, a known Android banking trojan, on the official
Play Store with 100.000+ downloads. Recently, other researchers publicly disclosed
the same malicious dropper application.
This dropper hides behind a fake utility application. Since its relatively small amount of
permissions and small footprint, it appeared as a legitimate app and was able to
elude the antivirus solutions and the Google Play analysis.
After the installation phase, the dropper uses advanced evasion techniques, such as
steganography, file deletion, and code obfuscation, in addition with multiple checks
before the malware download.

Once the banking trojan (Vultur) has been downloaded and installed through a fake
update, Threat Actors (TAs) can observe everything that happens on the infected
devices and carry out bank fraud through ATO (Account Takeover) attacks.

Analysis of the malicious dropper
During the last years, the number of Android banking trojans has increased, and new
techniques to perform banking fraud have been developed. Although most of the banking
trojans are distributed via *ishing campaigns, TAs also use official app stores to deliver their
malware using dropper applications, namely an application designed to download malware
into the target device.
One of the main reasons behind this choice is the possibility of reaching a more significant
number of potential victims and, thus, a greater likelihood of completing fraud. Furthermore,
since these droppers hide behind utility apps and come from a trusted source, they can
mislead even “experienced” users.
The application, discovered in October by the Cleafy TIR team on the Google Play Store,
appears like a legitimate recovery tool with a relatively small amount of permissions and a
small footprint.

The combination of these elements, plus the use of multiple evasion techniques, makes the
application very difficult to detect with automatic sandboxes or machine learning
methodology. It goes, then, undetected by antivirus solutions and Google Protects.
This explains why, even though an overview of this dropper was already described in the last
article of Threat Fabric, we decided to publish this report and analyze in detail how this
application ended up in the Play Store and attempted to commit bank fraud.
The application found on the Play Store belongs to the Brunhilda dropper service since it
shares multiple behaviors with the same past related samples, such as:
The request of Android 8.0 or above versions;
Some code similarities;
The information sent to the C2 server and his configuration.

Figure 3 - Antivirus detection of the Vultur’s dropper application
The application code has changed compared to previous variants and a piece of interesting
evidence is the use of multiple evasion techniques, used to stay undetectable and slow down
the analysis. Some techniques are listed below:

3/7

Steganography (a technique used to hide secret data within an ordinary file to avoid
detection): as shown in Figure 4, inside the application asset directory, there is a PNG
file that hides an encrypted payload that, once decrypted, becomes a zip file that
contains a dex file. The following dex file contains the code used to communicate with
the C2 server and download the “real” malware on the user devices (currently, the
Android banking trojan called Vultur).

Figure 4 - Extraction of encrypted payload from PNG image
File Deletion: After the payload is decrypted and uncompressed, both the zip and dex
files are removed from their directories, as shown in Figure 5.
Code obfuscation and Anti-emulation: All the code is obfuscated, and the strings are
encrypted with the AES algorithm. Moreover, the dropper performs multiple checks to
control if it is running on an emulator/sandbox device or a legitimate one to stop the
attack or proceed.

Once the victim downloads and installs the application from the Google Play Store to
complete the attack chain, the dropper displays to the user a persistent update request to
download a new application (Figure 6) that represents the actual malware, namely the
Android banking trojan belonging to the Vultur family.
Although in that way, the user has to accept the Android permission to download and install
the application from a different source than the official Google Store, this technique allows
TAs to not upload the malicious application directly to the official store, making the dropper
application undetectable.

Overview of Vultur
When the user installs the application requested in the fake update, a new popup appears to
the user (Figure 8). Notably, the malware needs the “notorious” Accessibility Services to
control the user’s device.

5/7

At this point, Vultur uses multiple techniques to try to remain unsuspected in the eyes of the
user, in particular:
A fake alert is displayed to the user, saying, “This update is incompatible with the
current version of the Play Store and will be removed,” followed by a toast (a small
Android popup) saying that the application has been removed;
The icon of the downloaded application is not displayed on the phone;
With the accessibilities services, the malware does not allow the infected user to open
the settings app to see which applications are installed on their device
Furthermore, if an analyst tries to install Vultur directly on a device, to analyze it, the malware
does not start, and it does not communicate with the C2 server. The malware must be
installed and launched through the dropper application.

Figure 8 - Installation phases of Vultur
Using keylogging and screen recording capabilities, TAs can obtain all the information they
need to carry out their fraudulent activities. During our investigations, we noticed that the
usual modus operandi of Vultur’s TAs is to try to carry out bank fraud during the night hours.

Final Considerations
This research aims to show how TAs are constantly improving their techniques to stay
undetected using advanced evasion techniques such as steganography, file deletion, and
code obfuscation. And at the same time, the use of official app stores to deliver banking
6/7

trojans to reach a more significant number of potential victims is a new trend that is gaining
strength.
According to our findings, we expect to see new sophisticated banking droppers campaigns
on the official stores in the next months.
