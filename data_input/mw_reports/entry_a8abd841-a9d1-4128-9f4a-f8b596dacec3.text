Increase in Emotet Activity and Cobalt Strike Deployment

Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.
We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.
Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.
In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.
Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?

1/3

We found Emotet, a former banking malware, now focused on loading or delivering
follow-on malware.
Emotet was disrupted in early 2021 but made a comeback in November 2021.
Historically, Emotet has installed malware such as Trickbot or Qakbot, which in
turn have led to hands-on-keyboard adversaries and ransomware deployment.
In December 2021, researchers closely monitoring Emotet reported instances of the
malware deploying the Cobalt Strike intrusion tool.
In February 2022, other researchers have reported Cobalt Strike deployment within 5
hours of an Emotet infection originating from the Epoch 5 botnet.
The direct deployment of the intrusion tool is a concern considering its use in handson-intrusions linked to ransomware deployment and extortion attacks.
Deploying the tool directly expedites network intrusion actions, requiring
defenders to act swiftly to contain patient zero or risk the attacker expanding the
scope of their access.
eSentire security teams have identified and disrupted multiple Emotet infections across
our customers in recent weeks, none of which escalated to Cobalt Strike deployment.
These incidents followed the typical Emotet trajectory with macro-laced office files
arriving via email resulting in code execution through VBScript and PowerShell.

How did we find it?
Recent activity has been identified through a mix of threat hunting activity and
detections from BlueSteel, our machine-learning PowerShell classifier.

What did we do?
In instances where Emotet activity was identified, our team of 24/7 SOC Cyber
Analysts isolated the host(s) and worked with the customer to remediate the threat.
TRU deployed additional detection content based on the analysis of recent incident
observations.

What can you learn from this TRU positive?
Given the threat of the direct deployment of Cobalt Strike, rapid identification and
containment of hosts infected with Emotet is critical now more than ever.
Infected systems should be examined for presence of Cobalt Strike or other follow-on
malware. Emotet stores a copy of itself and Cobalt Strike in
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\random-directory-name\.

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
Loader malware attempts to install other malware, so the first priority should be to identify
and investigate the presence of follow-on malware on systems. In addition, we recommend:

2/3

Employ email filtering and protection measures.
Block or quarantine email attachments such as EXEs, Password Protected ZIPs,
JavaScript, Visual Basic scripts.
Implement anti-spoofing measures such as DMARC and SPF.
Employ an MFA solution to reduce impact of compromised credentials.
Train users to identify and report suspicious emails and documents, even if
opened.
Protect your endpoints against malware.
Ensure antivirus signatures are up to date.
Use a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product
to detect and contain threats.
Limit or disable macros across the organization. See UK's National Cyber
Centre guidance on Macro Security.

Ask Yourself…
Is your malware identification and remediation process agile enough to disrupt followon attacks stemming from loader malware?
If you’re not currently engaged with a Managed Detection and Response provider, we highly
recommend you partner with us for security services in order to disrupt threats before they
impact your business.
