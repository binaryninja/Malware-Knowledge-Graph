June 22, 2021

In this blog, we describe a string of recent incidents in which the CrowdStrike Falcon
Complete™ team observed a financially motivated eCrime operator (likely WIZARD
SPIDER) use compromised external remote services (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol,
or RDP) along with Cobalt Strike in an unsuccessful attempt to deploy ransomware. This
activity indicates a notable increase in the adversary’s tactics to include RDP brute forcing
along with their more traditional modus operandi for initial access via phishing or leveraging
their partner networks of access brokers.
We will provide a brief overview of the observed tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
in these cases along with an outline of the Falcon Complete team’s approach to quickly
detect and contain the interactive attacker before the threat actor was able to complete
actions on objective.

Campaign TTPs Overview

1/9

In recent weeks, the Falcon Complete team has conducted several response operations to
incidents involving compromised RDP credentials as an initial infection vector. This was
followed by execution of reconnaissance commands, installation of Cobalt Strike and
additional tooling.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the threat actor responsible for this activity is likely
WIZARD SPIDER due to the following overlapping TTPs with WIZARD SPIDER activity
clusters:
Cobalt Strike stager DLLs executed from the victim’s Music directory
Network indicators identified via hunting for related samples and infrastructure
exhibiting attributes of WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure
Using nltest and net Windows utilities to conduct reconnaissance activity
This assessment carries low confidence.

WIZARD SPIDER is a criminal group behind the core development and distribution of a
sophisticated arsenal of criminal tools, including the Trickbot, BazarLoader, Conti and Ryuk
malware variants. This adversary has used big game hunting (BGH) tactics to great effect
against a diverse set of targets across multiple sectors and geographies.
The typical activity patterns observed by the Falcon Complete team in recent intrusions
include an initial attack vector via compromised external remote services — commonly,
exposed RDP. This suggests a notable increase in this tactic. It is unclear whether the
increased focus on external remote services is a shift away from phishing and using access
brokers, or whether this is simply an addition to the adversary’s overall modus operandi.
Adversaries often obtain credentials in multiple ways, whether by brute forcing an externally
exposed service, purchasing them on underground markets or conducting credential
harvesting operations.
Once the actor has established a foothold within an environment, they will proceed with
reconnaissance activities to enumerate accounts and systems that may represent high-value
targets. Multiple reconnaissance commands were observed — in particular, nltest appears to
be a hallmark of this activity. Shown in Figure 2, the adversary first enumerated the trusted
domains in the environment, and then a list of domain controllers. Their goal was likely to
move laterally to one of these systems.

The threat actor then installed additional tooling for post-exploitation activities. This typically
included Cobalt Strike for command and control, where the stager DLLs were written to the
user’s Music directory. BloodHound or Adfind were pulled down from an external resource
for additional account enumeration in preparation for lateral movement. This secondary
reconnaissance is handled by a BAT file written to the same Music directory.

Figure 3 presents many of the common patterns related to the observed activity cluster as
seen in the Falcon console. This process tree graph view indicates the initial process
injection under the explorer.exe process via rundll32.exe , along with the initial
reconnaissance commands such as nltest under the conhost.exe process.

Falcon Complete Detection and Response
Initial Detection and Triage
The Falcon Complete team has observed multiple related incidents over the past several
weeks that share common TTPs, as noted above. Below, we present a case study of these
contextual indicators observed during a specific incident.

3/9

The response process began when the Falcon Complete team received a high-severity
machine learning (ML) detection for a suspicious process injection via rundll32.exe .
Further investigation indicated that this process injection was related to the threat actor
abusing Microsoft Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros in an uncommon way.

Figure 4. Process tree with Microsoft Excel copy/paste (Click to enlarge)

This shellcode was a typical stager that functioned as a downloader to fetch a Cobalt Strike
payload from the attacker-controlled command and control (C2). These resources were
written to the C:\Users\Public\Music directory.

Adversaries utilizing Microsoft Office documents weaponized with VBA macros is nothing
new, but the activity described above differs significantly from phishing campaigns leveraging
macro documents to achieve initial access. Instead, the document was being used to

4/9

execute code after initial access had been achieved on a system via a compromised
account.
We have observed multiple instances of files written that were named either “New Microsoft
Word Document.docx” or “New Microsoft Excel Worksheet.xlsx,” which are the default
naming schemes for new document templates in Windows. Next, a macro executes a
shellcode payload via the rundll32.exe process, which is a Cobalt Strike stager, but the
macro’s shellcode is never written to disk.
This is likely an evasion technique attempting to bypass host-based security controls to
execute shellcode. What appears to be happening is the threat actors are copying and
pasting the malicious macro directly into a blank document template over the RDP session.
The advantage of this approach is that the macros are not written to disk and are only
executed in memory. This activity was then followed by similar reconnaissance commands
observed in Figure 2 above.

Containment and Investigation
At this point, we were confident that an adversary was interactive and had compromised the
victim host. We observed them attempting to perform reconnaissance in preparation for
privilege escalation and lateral movement. The next steps were to contain and identify the
full scope of the incident.
Our analysts have the capability to network-contain a host to prevent the lateral spread of the
adversary within the environment. This immediately denies the adversary remote access by
only allowing the host to communicate with the CrowdStrike Security Cloud.

The next objective of the investigation was to properly scope the intrusion by identifying the
affected systems/user accounts and host/network indicators of compromise. We can pivot
into our endpoint activity monitoring (EAM) application, which provides endpoint telemetry so
we can gain further context and determine the origin of the intrusion.

The goal here was determining the user account that the threat actor compromised and
leveraged for remote access. In Figure 7, a simple query for type 10 logons can determine
this account. This query also gives us the Remote IP, which is the source host of the RDP
logon. This information could also be gleaned from a Falcon Real Time Response (RTR)
session on the host to query the security event logs via PowerShell, such as the following
snippet:

The EAM application can also be used to search for residual host artifacts that the adversary
may have left behind on the system. From the initial detection triage, we can then pivot from
data points such as the injected process, directory locations and specific file types of interest.
A basic query is shown in Figure 9 to identify the artifacts of interest that remain on disk.

Based on observations from previous intrusions, we knew that a batch file may be present in
the same directory as the Cobalt Strike stager. As noted before, this batch file is responsible
for conducting further reconnaissance with Adfind to explore the Active Directory
6/9

environment. As shown in Figure 9, the EAM query also captured the command
rundll32.exe test.dll, Lemon . This command is responsible and is used for process
injection via rundll32.exe . Previously, the Falcon Complete team has observed similar
patterns regarding one-word export functions such as “Lemon“ in this case, and “Lime“ in
similar instances. These one-word export functions likely suggest a possible common
naming convention for exports, related to Cobalt Strike DLLs across the intrusions observed.
Investigators can use this indicator to pivot or enrich related data sets of potentially linked
activity clusters.
Next, the team performed dynamic malware analysis on the Cobalt Strike stager sample. We
discovered that the binary’s code was configured to reach out to the domain
serviapd[.]com for C2. At this point in the investigation, we had determined both the
system and user scopes, identified host artifacts and extracted network indicators of
compromise (IOCs) from the malware. Armed with this information, the Falcon Complete
team could now begin removing the actor’s malware from the affected systems.

Remediation
The Falcon Complete team directly performs many of the critical remediation actions for our
customers via Falcon RTR.
A typical remediation can be broken into three distinct steps:
1. Killing the malicious processes (e.g., injected rundll, explorer, conhost)
2. Locating and removing the persistence mechanism (e.g., compromised accounts,
services)
3. Removing disk artifacts (e.g., binaries and directories)

In this case, we have rated this remediation as “Easy,” based on the velocity and total effort
required for proper recovery. Due to the rapid response time to contain and evict the
adversary, there was not an extensive list of clean-up actions to be taken.
STEP 1. Finding and Killing the Malicious Process
Falcon did a lot of the work for us here and had already terminated the injected processes.
The running process was reviewed to ensure no injected threads were still executing
malicious code. We have provided more details for finding injected process in previous
blogs:

STEP 2. Removing Persistence
The adversary did not have time (or didn’t bother) to establish persistence beyond the
compromised account credentials leveraged in the RDP session. We worked with the client
to reset these accounts and harden remote services to avoid further exploitation. Our
recommendations for best practices include:
Using multifactor authentication (MFA) for remote access services
Disabling RDP or any services that are not required
Using non-standard ports if required
Deploying technical controls such as Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of remote
services
STEP 3. Removing Remaining Artifacts
Using Falcon RTR, we removed all adversary tooling and file system residue present in the
C:\Users\Public\Music directory.
The steps outlined above are the general process for successfully remediating a host for the
artifacts of this intrusion set.

The Efficiency of Falcon Complete
The Falcon Complete team identified an interactive adversary that had compromised an
external remote service and gained illicit access to a managed host in our client’s
environment. This threat actor attempted to download and execute additional tooling in a
likely attempt to stage ransomware. The team quickly contained, scoped and remediated this
threat with the Falcon RTR capability without requiring any reboots, reimages or other
disruption to the client’s business operations. The following figure highlights the significant
milestones during our detection and response efforts.

8/9

This activity was attributed to the financially motivated adversary tracked as WIZARD
SPIDER.
The Falcon Complete team has observed multiple similar TTPs in several recent intrusions
that indicate a general tactical increase or preference for compromising external remote
services (such as RDP) as an initial infection vector. It is unclear but possible that this activity
is simply in addition to this actor’s “normal” email phishing operations. We also noted an
interesting usage of a technique leveraging Microsoft Office macros following initial access. It
is likely that eCrime actors will continue to use this technique going forward. The Falcon
Complete team will continue to track this threat and monitor our clients’ environments for any
notable developments.
