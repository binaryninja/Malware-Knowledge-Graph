Among the most significant malware-induced cybersecurity incidents in recent years were
the attacks against the Ukrainian power grid – which resulted in unprecedented blackouts
two years in a row – and the devastating NotPetya ransomware outbreak. Let’s take a look
at the links between these major incidents.
The first ever malware-enabled blackout in history, which happened in December 2015, was
facilitated by the BlackEnergy malware toolkit. ESET researchers have been following the
activity of the APT group utilizing BlackEnergy both before and after this milestone event.

After the 2015 blackout, the group seemed to have ceased actively using BlackEnergy, and
evolved into what we call TeleBots.
It is important to note that when we describe ‘APT groups’, we’re drawing connections
based on technical indicators such as code similarities, shared C&C infrastructure, malware
execution chains, and so on. We’re typically not directly involved in the investigation and
identification of the individuals writing the malware and/or deploying it, and the interpersonal
relations between them. Furthermore, the term ‘APT group’ is very loosely defined, and
often used simply to cluster the abovementioned malware indicators. This is also one of the
reasons why we refrain from speculations with regard to attributing attacks to nation states
and such.
That said, we have observed and documented ties between the BlackEnergy attacks – not
only those against the Ukrainian power grid but against various sectors and high-value
targets – and a series of campaigns (mostly) against the Ukrainian financial sector by the
TeleBots group. In June 2017, when many large corporations worldwide were hit by the
Diskcoder.C ransomware (aka Petya and NotPetya) – most probably as unintended
collateral damage – we discovered that the outbreak started spreading from companies
afflicted with a TeleBots backdoor, resulting from the compromise of the financial software
M.E.Doc, popular in Ukraine.
So how does Industroyer, the sophisticated malware framework used to cause the blackout
of December 2016, fit into all of this? Right after we publicly reported our discovery, some
security companies and news media outlets started to speculate that Industroyer was also
architected by the BlackEnergy/Telebots group (sometimes also referred to as Sandworm).
Yet, no concrete evidence has been publicly disclosed until now.
In April 2018, we discovered new activity from the TeleBots group: an attempt to deploy a
new backdoor, which ESET detects as Win32/Exaramel. Our analysis suggests that this
TeleBots’ backdoor is an improved version of the main Industroyer backdoor – the first
piece of evidence that was missing.

Analysis of the Win32/Exaramel backdoor
The Win32/Exaramel backdoor is initially deployed by a dropper. Metadata in this dropper
suggest that the backdoor is compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio just before deployment
on a particular, victimized computer.

Figure 1. PE timestamp in the dropper of Win32/Exaramel backdoor

Once executed, the dropper deploys the Win32/Exaramel backdoor binary in the Windows
system directory and creates and starts a Windows service named wsmprovav with the
description “Windows Check AV”. The filename and the Windows service description are
hardcoded into the dropper.

Figure 2. Registry settings of the Windows service created by the Win32/Exaramel backdoor

In addition, the dropper writes the backdoor’s configuration into the Windows registry, in
XML format.

Figure 3. Win32/Exaramel backdoor XML configuration

The configuration contains several blocks:
Interval – time in milliseconds used for Sleep function
Servers – list of command and control (C&C) servers
Check – website used to determine whether the host has an internet connection available
Proxy – proxy server on the host network
Storage – path used for storing files scheduled for exfiltration
As can be seen from the first line of the configuration, the attackers are grouping their
targets based on the security solutions in use. Similar behavior can be found in the
Industroyer toolset – specifically some of the Industroyer backdoors were also disguised as
an AV-related service (deployed under the name avtask.exe) and used the same grouping.
Another interesting fact is that the backdoor uses C&C servers with domain names that
mimic domains belonging to ESET. In addition to esetsmart[.]org from the above mentioned
configuration, we found another similar domain: um10eset[.]net, which was used by
4/11

recently-discovered Linux version of Telebots malware. It is important to note that these
attacker-controlled servers are in no way related to ESET’s legitimate server infrastructure.
Currently, we haven’t seen Exaramel use domains that mimic other security companies.
Once the backdoor is running, it connects to a C&C server and receives commands to be
executed. Here is a list of all available commands:
Launch process
Launch process under specified Windows user
Write data to a file in specified path
Copy file into storage sub-directory (Upload file)
Execute shell command
Execute shell command as specified Windows user
Execute VBS code using MSScriptControl.ScriptControl.1
The code of the command loop and implementations of the first six commands are very
similar to those found in a backdoor used in the Industroyer toolset.

Figure 4. Comparison between decompiled code of the Win32/Exaramel backdoor (on the left) and
the Win32/Industroyer backdoor (on the right)

Both malware families use a report file for storing the resulting output of executed shell
commands and launched processes. In case of the Win32/Industroyer backdoor, the report
file is stored in a temporary folder under a random filename; in case of the Win32/Exaramel
backdoor, the report file is named report.txt and its storage path is defined in the backdoor’s
configuration file.

5/11

In order to redirect standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the report file,
both backdoors set the hStdOutput and hStdError parameters to a handle of the report file.
This is another design similarity between these malware families.

the Win32/Industroyer backdoor (on the bottom)

If the malware operators want to exfiltrate files from the victim’s computer, they just need to
copy those files into the data sub-directory of the storage path defined in the configuration.
Once the backdoor is about to make a new connection to the C&C server it will
6/11

automatically compress and encrypt all these files before sending them.
The main difference between the backdoor from the Industroyer toolset and this new
TeleBots backdoor is that the latter uses XML format for communication and configuration
instead of a custom binary format.

Password stealing malicious tools
Along with the Exaramel backdoor, Telebots group uses some of their old tools, including a
password stealer (internally referred as CredRaptor or PAI by the attackers) and a slightlymodified Mimikatz.
The CredRaptor custom password-stealer tool, exclusively used by this group since 2016,
has been slightly improved. Unlike previous versions, it collects saved passwords not only
from browsers, but also from Outlook and many FTP clients. Here is a list of supported
applications:
BitKinex FTP
BulletProof FTP Client
Classic FTP
CoffeeCup
Core FTP
Cryer WebSitePublisher
CuteFTP
FAR Manager
FileZilla
FlashFXP
Frigate3
FTP Commander
FTP Explorer
FTP Navigator
Google Chrome
Internet Explorer 7 – 11
Mozilla Firefox
Opera
Outlook 2010, 2013, 2016
SmartFTP
SoftX FTP Client
Total Commander
TurboFTP
Windows Vault
WinSCP
WS_FTP Client

This improvement allows attackers to collect webmaster’s credentials for websites and
credentials for servers in internal infrastructure. Once access to such servers is obtained,
attackers could plant additional backdoors there. Quite often these servers are operated by
OSes other than Windows, so attackers have to adapt their backdoors.
In fact, during our incident response, we discovered a Linux backdoor used by TeleBots.
We named this backdoor Linux/Exaramel.A.

Analysis of the Linux/Exaramel backdoor
The backdoor is written in the Go programming language and compiled as a 64-bit ELF
binary. Attackers can deploy the backdoor in a chosen directory under any name.
If the backdoor is executed by attackers with the string ‘none’ as a command line argument,
then it attempts to use persistence mechanisms in order to be started automatically after
reboot. If the backdoor is not executed under the root account, then it uses the crontab file.
However, if running as root, it supports different Linux init systems. It determines which init
system is currently in use by executing the command:
strings /sbin/init | awk ‘match($0, /(upstart|systemd|sysvinit)/){ print substr($0, RSTART,
RLENGTH);exit; }’
Based on the result of this command, it uses the following hardcoded locations for its
persistence:
Init system

Location

sysvinit

/etc/init.d/syslogd

upstart

/etc/init/syslogd.conf

systemd

/etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service

During startup, the backdoor attempts to open a configuration file named config.json, which
is stored in the same directory as the backdoor. If this configuration file does not exist, then
a new file is created. The configuration is encrypted using the key s0m3t3rr0r via the RC4
algorithm.

The backdoor connects to the hardcoded C&C server (by default 176.31.225[.]204 in the
sample we have seen to date) or to the C&C server listed in the configuration files Hosts
value. The communication is sent over HTTPS. The backdoor supports the following
commands:
Command

Purpose

App.Update

Updates itself to a newer version

App.Delete

Deletes itself from the system

App.SetProxy

Sets proxy in configuration

App.SetServer

Updates C&C server in configuration

App.SetTimeout

Sets timeout value (time between connections to C&C server)

IO.WriteFile

Downloads a file from a remote server

IO.ReadFile

Uploads a file from local disk to C&C server

OS.ShellExecute

Executes a shell command

Conclusion
The discovery of Exaramel shows that the TeleBots group is still active in 2018 and the
attackers keep improving their tools and tactics.
The strong code similarity between the Win32/Exaramel backdoor and the Industroyer main
backdoor is the first publicly-presented evidence linking Industroyer to TeleBots, and hence
to NotPetya and BlackEnergy. While the possibility of false flags – or a coincidental code
sharing by another threat actor – should always be kept in mind when attempting attribution,
in this case we consider it unlikely.
Of particular interest is the fact that the attackers started to use ESET-themed domain
names in their operations. It should be noted that these domains were used by
cybercriminals in order to hide their malicious network activity from defenders and are in no
way related to ESET’s server infrastructure. The list of legitimate domains used by ESET
products can be found here.
It should also be noted that these Win32 and Linux Exaramel backdoors were detected at
an organization that is not an industrial facility. ESET shared its findings ahead of time with
Ukrainian investigation authorities and thanks to this cooperation the attack was
successfully localized and prevented.
ESET researchers will continue to monitor the activity of this group.
