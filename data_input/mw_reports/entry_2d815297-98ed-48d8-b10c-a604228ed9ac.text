Ransomware Performs Targeted Attack

Cyble Research Labs has identified a new ransomware malware known as DarkAngels.
Analysis of the DarkAngels malware uncovered similarities between it and the Babuk
Ransomware.
While executing the sample, we observed that the ransom note, and the TAs website,
contain a specific organization’s name indicating that the malware sample may have been
developed as part of a highly targeted attack.
This blog showcases the deep-dive analysis of one of the DarkAngels ransomware samples
to identify their capabilities and the way to protect yourself/your organization from them.

Technical Analysis
1/10

Based on static analysis, we found that the malicious file is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface
(GUI) based binary, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – Static File Information of DarkAngels Sample
Upon execution, the malware first changes the priority of the process i.e to zero by calling
the SetProcessShutdownParameters() API so that the malware’s activities can be terminated
only before the system shutdown. This is a way to increase the amount of time the malware
gets to execute in the compromised machine.

Figure 2 – Malware
Changes the Priority of the Process
The malware tries to terminate the services before encrypting the system to ensure no
interruption during its encryption process. To identify the services in the victim’s machine,
it calls the OpenSCManagerA() API, which establishes a connection to the service control
manager and gives the malware access to the service control manager database, as shown
in Figure 3.

Enumerates Services
After gaining access, the malware enumerates the services and fetches the service names in
the victim’s machines. The ransomware then checks the presence of the services such as
VSS, SQL, Memtas, etc., and terminates them if the services are actively running on the
victim’s machine.
The ransomware also enumerates the running processes using
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(), Process32FirstW(), and Process32NextW() APIs, checks the
process names such as sql.exe,oracle.exe, powerpnt.exe, etc., and terminates them if they
are actively running.

Furthermore, we noticed that the binary launches the vssadmin.exe process to delete all
Shadow Copy, as shown in figure 5. The malware deletes shadow copies to avoid recovery
of the system after encrypting the files.

Figure 5 – Deletes All Shadow Copies
The malware deletes all items from the Recycle Bin by calling the “SHEmptyRecycleBinA()
API to ensure no deleted files are restored after encryption.

from Recycle Bin
After execution, DarkAngels Ransomware tries to get system information using
GetSystemInfo() API, which extracts information such as NumberOfProcessors.

DarkAngels Ransomware Collect System Info
The malware then creates a thread for all CPUs that it encounters, creates ransom notes
named How_To_Restore_Your_Files.txt, and encrypts the files present in the victim’s
machine.
The malware enumerates the system and excludes the folders such as AppData, Boot,
Windows, Windows.old, etc., from the encryption process.
The ransomware specifically excludes files such as autorun.inf, boot.ini,bootfont.bin, etc.,
from encryption.
The ransomware also excludes file extensions such as .exe, .dll, and .babyk. The .babyk is a
well-known extension for Babuk ransomware which indicates the DarkAngels is linked to
Babuk ransomware.
Like Babuk ransomware, the DarkAngels appends a signature “choung dong looks like hot
dog” at the end of the encrypted file, indicating the ransomware is linked to Babuk.

at the end of an encrypted file
The below figure demonstrates the ransom note dropped by the malware with the name
“How_To_Restore_Your_Files.txt” to instruct the victims to pay the ransom money for the
decryption tool.

Figure 9 – Ransom note
In their ransom note, the TAs have instructed victims to contact them through their TOR
website. In addition, the TAS threatens the victims to disclose their data if they do not
respond within four days after the attack and notify government supervision agencies,
competitors, and clients.
After dropping the ransom notes, the malware encrypts the files on the victim’s machine and
appends the extension with “.crypt,” as shown in the below figure.

Encrypted Files on the Machine
DarkAngels has the capability to be spared through network shares and paths of the infected
machine, as shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11 – Checks for Network shares
and paths
If the given command-line argument is “shares,” then the ransomware finds Network shares
and retrieves information about each shared resource on a server using NetShareEnum()
API. Furthermore, it checks for $ADMIN share and starts encrypting the files.

Figure 12 – Enumerate Shares and Encrypt

Files
If the given command-line argument is “paths,” then the ransomware calls GetDriveTypeW()
API to find out the network drive connected to the infected machine. Once the network drive
is identified, the ransomware starts encrypting the files.

Figure 13 – Enumerate

Drives and Encrypt Files
When the command line arguments “-paths” and “-shares” are not provided, and also no
mutex named “DarkAngels” opened in the infected machine then, the ransomware
recursively traverses through all local drives and encrypts the files.

Conclusion
There is a strong correlation between the DarkAngels malware and the existing Babuk
ransomware code. It is common for threat actors to leverage existing code, modifying it, and
rebranding it. Unlike Babuk ransomware, the Dark Angels are using the malware to target
specific organizations. This approach shows some TAs are specifically selecting their targets.
Thus far no DarkAngels leak site has been identified. However, considering the targeted
attacks one might appear soon.
We will continue to monitor DarkAngels’ extortion campaigns and update our readers with
the latest information.

Our Recommendations

9/10

We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control
against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

Safety measures needed to prevent ransomware attacks
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate
network.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other
connected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected
devices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their
authenticity.

Users should take the following steps after the ransomware attack
Detach infected devices on the same network.
Disconnect external storage devices if connected.
Inspect system logs for suspicious events.

Impacts and cruciality Of DarkAngels Ransomware:
Loss of Valuable data.
Loss of organization’s reliability or integrity.
Loss of organization’s business information.
Disruption in organization operation.
Economic loss.
