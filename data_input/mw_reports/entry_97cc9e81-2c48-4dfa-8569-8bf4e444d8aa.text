FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

A Russian national was sentenced today to nine years in prison for his operation of two
websites devoted to the facilitation of payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other
crimes before Senior U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in the Eastern District of Virginia.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal
Division, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Special
Agent in Charge Matthew S. Miller of the U.S. Secret Service’s Washington Field Office
made the announcement.
According to court documents, Aleksei Burkov, 30, ran a website called “Cardplanet” that
sold payment card numbers (e.g., debit and credit card numbers) that had been stolen
primarily through computer intrusions, victimizing hundreds of thousands. Many of the card
numbers offered for sale belonged to U.S. citizens. The stolen credit card data sold on
Burkov’s site has resulted in over $20 million in fraudulent purchases made using U.S. credit
card accounts.

Burkov also ran another website that served as an invite-only club where elite cybercriminals
could advertise stolen goods, such as personal identifying information and malicious
software, and criminal services, such as money laundering and hacking services. To obtain
membership in Burkov’s cybercrime forum, prospective members needed three existing
members to “vouch” for their good reputation among cybercriminals and to provide a sum of
money, normally $5,000, as insurance. These measures were designed to keep law
enforcement from accessing Burkov’s cybercrime forum and to ensure that members of the
forum honored any deals made while conducting business on the forum.
Burkov was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel in December 2015. An
Israeli district court approved his extradition in 2017. He was extradited to the United States
from Israel on Nov. 11, 2019, after appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High
Court of Justice were denied. On Jan. 23, 2020, he pleaded guilty to one count of access
device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft,
computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering.
Senior Trial Attorney Laura Fong of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual
Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S. Dwyer and Alexander P. Berrang of
the Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. The Criminal Division’s Office of
International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the defendant’s extradition
from Israel.
