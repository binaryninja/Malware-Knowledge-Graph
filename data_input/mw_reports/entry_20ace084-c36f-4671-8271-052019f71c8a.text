Welcome NCCIC
National security has become
interconnected with our Nation’s
cybersecurity. The National Cybersecurity
and Communications Integration Center
(NCCIC) provides critical national
capabilities. The NCCIC’s primary focus
areas include conducting daily analysis
and situational awareness, incident
management, and information sharing in
the cybersecurity and communications domains.
The NCCIC organization supports a holistic approach at home
and abroad to prevention, protection, mitigation, response,
and recovery efforts. The NCCIC is a 24/7 Communications
Operations and Integration Center.
NCCIC partners include all federal departments and agencies;
state, local, tribal, and territorial governments; the private sector;
and international entities.
In 2013, the NCCIC as a whole received over 220,000 reports
of cybersecurity and communications incidents. These reports
originated from both public and private partners sharing what
they discovered on their information technology systems. The
outreach facilitated gaining insights on the latest prevention and
mitigation measures from the broader national cybersecurity
community. In the coming years, an even greater number of cyber
incidents are likely with a renewed need to solve cybersecurity
and communications-related challenges as expeditiously as
possible.
I am proud of the hard work and dedication illustrated by the
NCCIC team.
Sincerely,
Larry Zelvin, Director
National Cybersecurity and Communications
Integration Center (NCCIC)

Welcome ICS-CERT
This year, the Industrial Control
Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) briefed asset owners
and developed tools and capabilities to
enhance cybersecurity incident handling
and response efforts.
ICS-CERT correlated emerging cyber
incidents with previous events and
tracked known threat actors based on
their techniques and tactics. The information these tools and
capabilities yielded was leveraged to provide situational awareness
information to federal law enforcement agencies and the greater
industrial control system community.
ICS-CERT initiatives accomplished in 2013 included:
• Providing briefings, including classified briefings, on
industrial control systems threats and defense-in-depth to
critical infrastructure owners, operators, and vendors as well
as other industry and government partners.
• Hosting meetings and presenting event information and
mitigations across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors.
• Triaging over 250 cybersecurity incidents by providing
analytic support and guidance to asset owners.
• Delivering expert guidance and consultation to asset
owners and operators on the self-assessment Cyber Security
Evaluation Tool (CSET®) or Architecture Reviews.
• Engaging in one Industrial Control System Joint Working
Group meeting bringing together the industrial control
system community to share its best cybersecurity practices,
create new relationships, and leverage knowledge from
ICS-CERT.

National Preparedness
The economic welfare and safety of the American people
relies on the resilience and reliability of the Nation’s
critical infrastructure. The National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center/Industrial Control
Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (NCCIC/
ICS-CERT) provides a variety of operational capabilities to
ensure that critical infrastructure across the nation continues
to operate as designed and is well secured. These efforts
require continual vigilance and innovative responses to
address emerging challenges at a global level. ICS-CERT
brings together a community of critical infrastructure
stakeholders who work together to improve our national
cybersecurity posture and address future needs.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) applies
guidance from Presidential Policy Directive 8: National
Preparedness to enable operational programs like ICS-CERT
to align key roles and responsibilities in its national
cybersecurity response and mitigation efforts.
The critical principles establish a fundamental doctrine
for ICS-CERT response capabilities that include: engaged

2

partnership; tiered response; scalable, flexible, and adaptable
operational capabilities; unity of effort through unified
command; and readiness to act.
ICS-CERT employs an adaptable and repeatable process
to ensure that ICS-CERT vendors, operators, and owners
across the country can organize response efforts to address
a variety of cybersecurity risks based on their unique needs
and capabilities. This framework is not based on a one-sizefits-all organizational construct. Instead, it acknowledges
the concept of tiered response, which emphasizes that
response to cybersecurity incidents, and should be handled
at the right level to support the critical infrastructure sector
owner, operator, or vendor.
ICS-CERT operations in this brochure are described by the
attributes that support its scalable, flexible, and adaptable
coordinating structures. The program has roles and
responsibilities which include integrating capabilities across
the whole community, local, state, tribal, territorial, and
federal governments in support of response to actual and
potential cybersecurity incidents.

Prevention
Outreach Across Critical Infrastructure Sectors
ICS-CERT supports prevention through the deployment of
operational capabilities to avoid, or stop a cybersecurity
threat. Prevention in this context relies on an engaged
partnership with the industrial control system community
of owners, operators, and vendors.
DHS ICS-CERT, in coordination with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Department of Energy, the
Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center,
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Oil
and Natural Gas and Pipelines Sector Coordinating Councils’
Cybersecurity Working Group, conducted a series of Action
Campaign Briefings throughout Fiscal Year 2013 in response
to the growing number of cyber incidents related to U.S.
critical infrastructure. The 14 briefings were given to over
750 attendees in various cities throughout the country to
assist asset owners and operators in detecting intrusions
and developing mitigation strategies. Briefings were held
at both the classified and unclassified levels, and covered a
wide range of topics. This included the latest threats against
industrial control systems, adversary tactics, lessons learned

4

from current activities, best practices for detecting and
preventing intrusion, and methods for securing networks.
Important sector-specific briefings:
• The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers
(AFPM) Quality and Assurance and Technology Forum/
AFPM Plant Automation and Decision Support Conference,
• Nuclear Sector Joint Cyber Subcouncil - Sponsored by
Nuclear Energy Institute,
• 7th Annual American Petroleum Institute Cybersecurity
Conference for the Oil & Natural Gas Industry,
• Chemical Classified Briefing for Chief Information
Officers,
• Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facility Conference,
• 2013 Chemical Sector Security Summit, and
• Cybersecurity for Oil and Natural Gas Forum.
This level of engagement supports the continuous development of resources to help industry understand and prepare
for ongoing and emerging control systems cybersecurity
issues, vulnerabilities, mitigation, and recovery strategies.

IC S -C ERT Year -in-Rev iew — 201 3

Prevention
Engaged Partnership with the ICSJWG
Partnership relies on engagement of the entire control
systems community by developing shared goals and
aligning capabilities to reduce the risks associated with
successful cyber attacks. Building a cohesive industrial
control system community includes supporting ongoing,
clear, consistent, and effective communications and shared
situational awareness about cybersecurity incidents,
mitigations, and recovery. ICS-CERT recognizes that
outreach plays a critical role in those coordination efforts.
ICS-CERT’s outreach strategy continues to leverage the
Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group, engaging
an increasingly broad range of partners, including critical
infrastructure sector-specific agencies; other federal, state,
local, and tribal government agencies; national groups and
councils; fusion centers; vendors; researchers and academia;
infrastructure owners and operators; and international
partners, including various CERTs.
The Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group 2013
Fall Meeting took place in Rockville, Maryland, at the
Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research/National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facility on

the grounds of the University of Maryland, Shady Grove
campus. The conference provided for two days of presentations consisting of topics of interest to the Industrial Control
Systems Joint Working Group community.
Highlights included:
• Presentations on a variety of topics such as Information
Technology Integration, Cyber Intelligence Analysis,
NIST ICS Standards, Fuzzing, and Industrial Control
Systems Security in the Healthcare sector.
• Discussions on the path forward for the Industrial Control
Systems Joint Working Group, including a detailed
explanation of new working activities and the associated
activity plan, as well as an overview of the outstanding
products developed by previous subgroup structures.

IC S -C ERT Year -in-Rev iew — 201 3

Protection
Tiered Support with the CSET
The ICS-CERT foundation tool to baseline cybersecurity
relative to cybersecurity standards is our Cyber Security
Evaluation Tool (CSET). In 2013, over 5,000 CSETs were
distributed and downloaded. As a significant piece of the
ICS-CERT proactive portfolio, CSET continues to support,
educate, and guide critical infrastructure asset owners. By
combining the use of recognized standards and a step-bystep wizard style, CSET has become an accepted practice for
critical infrastructure asset owners in establishing their own
cybersecurity baselines and processes.
CSET educates asset owners through an assessment process.
During this process, cybersecurity implementers and
management personnel are taken step by step through
a series of concepts and ideas. While considering each
concept, the assessment team reviews its individual
processes from a cybersecurity perspective. The team
discovers its own unique vulnerabilities while being
introduced to new concepts and principles of cybersecurity.
To accommodate more mature cybersecurity processes,
CSET now provides the capability for current CSET users
to use their past and current assessments to evaluate their
investment in an established cybersecurity process. The
release of CSET 6.0, helps users to establish a baseline

assessment and then incorporate following assessments
to trend and compare overall improvement. Users will be
able to drill down into specific areas to view trending in
areas such as account management, password-management,
defense-in-depth, or least user privileges. Users can use
this information to justify spending on particular areas of
vulnerability, prioritize work and investment, and determine
return on investment for cybersecurity-related spending.
New functionality CSET 6.0 includes:
• Video tutorials available on demand from YouTube.
• Component questions reflect the latest concerns and
issues in control system-related cybersecurity.
• High-level concept questions help the user to better
understand and navigate questions.
• Ability to assign different portions and sections of an
assessment and then merge all the pieces back together
to create a single assessment.
• Capability to combine assessments to compare
cybersecurity between divisions, find common
problems, or illustrate the distinctive needs for each
department.

Mitigation
Incident Response relies on a Scalable, Flexible,
and Adaptable Operational Capabilities
ICS-CERT operations rely on an adaptable and repeatable
approach to mitigate cyber attacks. The repeatable process
delivers core cybersecurity capabilities to industrial
control system owners, operators, and vendors. The
number, type, and mitigation resources ICS-CERT is able
to provide are directly proportional to the requirement of
the cybersecurity incident. As needs of an incident escalate
and change, the program remains scalable, flexible, and
adaptable in their incident response.
ICS-CERT’s suite of mobilized capabilities is associated
with those actions that may protect property and the
environment, stabilize communities and support basic
human needs after a significant cybersecurity incident.  
ICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure asset owners
and operators to respond to cyber incidents that have the
potential to impact any of the 16 critical infrastructure
sectors. ICS-CERT works with the potentially affected
organizations to offer mitigations and subject matter
expertise for immediate actions. The mitigations are specific
to the cyber threat and needs of the organizations.

8

In 2013, ICS-CERT applied capabilities to a number
of cyber incidents, coordinated researcher discovered
industrial control system vulnerabilities with vendors, and
produced alerts and advisories to notify the ICS community.
These situational awareness products provide actionable
information about mitigation and protection strategies for
implementing sound security practices.
This year, ICS-CERT received and responded to 257
incidents as voluntarily reported by asset owners and
industry partners. In 2013, attacks against the Energy sector
represented over 56 percent of all incidents reported to
ICS-CERT. The scope of incidents encompassed a vast range
of threats and observed methods for attempting to gain
access to both business and control systems infrastructure,
including:
• Unauthorized access and exploitation of Internetfacing ICS/SCADA devices
• Malware infections within air-gapped control system
networks (impacting operations)
• SQL Injection and application vulnerability
exploitation

IC S -C ERT Year -in-Rev iew — 201 3
• Lateral movement between network zones
• Targeted spear phishing campaigns
• Watering hole attacks (one of which utilized a zero-day
vulnerability)

Mitigation
Preparation Focuses Scalable, Flexible, and Adaptable
Approach to Incident and Vulnerability Analysis
ICS-CERT employs analysis to improve the security
posture and identify cybersecurity mitigation measures
for industrial control systems. Vulnerability coordination,
incident response, and mitigation services provided by
ICS-CERT rely on advanced analysis provided through our
Advanced Analytical Laboratory. The program cultivates
skills, tools, and personnel to meet the demands of
traditional industrial control systems security and today’s
threat landscape and evolving exploitation techniques.
The Advanced Analytical Laboratory conducted
vulnerability analysis and provided feedback and guidance
to the ICS-CERT Vulnerability Team. The ICS-CERT

prepared alerts and advisories using the vulnerability
information and working closely with the industrial
control system vendor. These alerts and advisories are
posted to the US-CERT secure portal and on the public
Web site. In total, the ICS-CERT Vulnerability Team
received 187 reports from researchers and vendors
that required coordination, testing, analysis, and the
publication of information products.
This year, the Advanced Analytical Laboratory focused
on improving ICS-CERT’s incident response capabilities
and tools to include rapid, enterprise scanning of
systems to look for known indicators of compromise for
sophisticated intrusions. At the request of asset owners,
these new capabilities as well as traditional incident
response techniques were deployed for seven onsite
incident response activations.
The Advanced Analytical Laboratory also made significant
improvements in its ability to handle and process
digital media. Advanced Analytical Laboratory developed
additional automation tools and techniques that have
shortened the turn-around time and increased the
thoroughness of the analysis.

In FY-13, ICS-CERT’s Advanced Analytical Laboratory analyzed data from
73 incidents. Phishing or spear-phishing attacks comprised
21 of the 73. Data from 11 incidents were related to intrusion
attempts by an emerging cyber threat actor as part of a larger
campaign involving more victims.

Response		
NCCIC Provides Unified Response
DHS provides analysis and support through the Office of
Cybersecurity & Communications, within the National
Protection and Programs Directorate, to an advanced
network of cybersecurity professionals who work to protect
critical infrastructure from cybersecurity threats.
The NCCIC, within the Office of Cybersecurity and
Communications, serves as a centralized location where
operational elements involved in cybersecurity for
critical infrastructure are coordinated and integrated with
ICS-CERT.
The NCCIC is composed of four branches:
United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team
(US-CERT) employs analysis techniques and expertise to
address malicious cyber activity targeting our nation’s
networks. US-CERT develops and deploys timely and
actionable information to federal departments and agencies,
state and local governments, private sector organizations,
and over 200 international partners. US-CERT operates the
National Cybersecurity Protection System, providing federal
departments and agencies with intrusion detection and
prevention capabilities.
10

ICS-CERT strengthens control systems cybersecurity
through public-private partnerships. ICS-CERT has four
focus areas: 1) situational awareness for stakeholders, 2)
control systems incident response and technical analysis,
3) control systems vulnerability coordination, and 4)
strengthening cybersecurity partnerships with government
departments and agencies.
National Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications leads and coordinates the initiation, restoration, and
reconstitution of telecommunications services or facilities
under all conditions. The NCC leverages partnerships with
government, industry, and international partners to obtain
situational awareness and determine priorities for protection
and response.
NCCIC Operations and Integration engages in planning,
coordination, and integration capabilities to synchronize
analysis, information sharing, and incident response efforts
across all NCCIC branches and activities. This includes
coordinating the continuity of operations responsibilities
for alternate site operations to support minimal disruption
to NCCIC mission essential functions. It acts as a 24-hour
clearinghouse for critical cyber and communications

IC S -C ERT Year -in-Rev iew — 201 3

Response
information and tracks and initiates critical information
requirements that guide the dissemination of critical
information.
The NCCIC operational activities include providing greater
understanding of cybersecurity and communications
situation awareness vulnerabilities, intrusions, incidents,
mitigation, and recovery actions. As the incident stabilizes,
each organizational response effort is able to support the
transition from response to recovery.
As mutually supporting, fully integrated elements of the
NCCIC, these branches provide the authorities, capabilities,
and partnerships necessary to lead a national approach to
addressing cybersecurity and communications issues at the
operational level.
The NCCIC organization works closely with those federal
departments and agencies most responsible for securing
the government’s cyber and communications systems
and actively engages with private sector companies and
institutions; state, local, tribal, and territorial governments;
and international counterparts. Each group of stakeholders
represents a community of practice, working together to
protect the portions of critical information technology with
which they own, operate, manage, or interact.

Unity of Effort Through Unified Command
Supported with ICS-CEA
The Industrial Control Systems Consequence Effects and
Analysis (ICS-CEA) framework is a collaboration tool.
ICS-CEA provides a critical infrastructure modeling and
simulation capability. The tool also provides a means for
users to model, analyze, and share information related to
potential consequences of naturally occurring or man-made
threats on our Nation’s critical infrastructure. The ICS-CEA
system provides the NCCIC a capability for daily use of
modeling, simulation, analysis, and information sharing
related to potential cross-sector “consequence” effects to
several critical infrastructures and their related sectors.
In 2013, ICS-CEA has been used for responding to multiple
requests by the NCCIC regarding the identification of
potentially affected critical infrastructure sectors because of
natural and potential man-made threats.

11

ICS -C E R T Ye ar - in- Review — 201 3

Recovery
ICS-CERT Applies Advanced Capabilities to Support
Recovery
ICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure asset owners
and operators to respond to cyber incidents that impact any
of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. ICS-CERT supports
recovery of the affected organization by providing adequate
interim and long-term solutions and subject matter
expertise for immediate actions. The response and recovery
are specific to the incident and needs of the organizations.
ICS-CERT provides cybersecurity evaluations to support the
reliability and resiliency of the systems that comprise and
interconnect critical infrastructures. ICS-CERT develops and
implements coordinated security measures in collaboration
with partners from across public, private, and international
communities.
In 2013, ICS-CERT conducted 72 onsite assessments across
the US critical infrastructure sectors. The objective of the
assessment is to establish a “baseline of performance” with

12

regard to cybersecurity maturity as defined within a suite of
cybersecurity standards and guidelines. Although the results
may differ from sector to sector, many of the vulnerabilities
and weaknesses within the networks and systems are
similar. This year has seen increased partnering with the
commercial nuclear industry and the energy sector with
regard to performing onsite cybersecurity assessments.
Cybersecurity assessments and recovery plans are tailored
to each individual organization depending on the level of
complexity in the systems. Asset owners can now request
CSET evaluations and/or Architecture Reviews, which is a
more in-depth comprehensive evaluation of specific control
systems networks, architectures, and components, to
support system analysis and future recovery actions.
ICS-CERT will continue to support the development of
tools and techniques available to ICS community members
affected by cyber incidents.

IC S -C ERT Year -in-Rev iew — 201 3

Future
ICS-CERT will advance and ensure the resilience and reliability
of the Nation’s critical infrastructure and protect key resources.
ICS-CERT’s mission is essential to the economic welfare and
safety of the American people.
ICS-CERT will engage and work with critical infrastructure
vendors, operators, and asset owners across the country to
enable response efforts to address a variety of cybersecurity
risks. A computer based training course is being developed
to engage a larger number vendor owner and operators. This
training will allow the program to reach more critical infrastructure professionals across the country. The program will
further enable a framework that acknowledges the concept of
tiered response, which emphasizes enabling the best possible
support to meet the unique challenges of each critical infrastructure sector.
ICS-CERT is committed to supporting a community of critical
infrastructure stakeholders to address future needs and
continue to improve cybersecurity capabilities. The Industrial
Control System Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) will support
membership groups to align activities and more effectively
employ member expertise. Going forward, the governing
body of ICSJWG will focus on development of working group

meetings, webinars, product review and approval, socialization
and marketing of deliverables. This approach will deliver on a
flexible and resilient approach to partner engagement, as well
as provide a substantial platform for the public and private
sectors to collaborate on the cybersecurity of the critical
infrastructure in FY-14.
The program will continue to support: engaged partnership;
tiered response; scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational
capabilities; unity of effort through unified command; and readiness to actively engage the public and private sectors, as well
as international partners to prepare for, prevent, and respond
to cybersecurity incidents that could impair strategic assets.
The rollout of CSET 6.0 will provide an unprecedented level of
organizational interaction with the tool to baseline and track
cybersecurity. ICS-CERT continually improves the program’s
resources to enhance the security, resiliency, and reliability of
the Nation’s cyber and communications infrastructure.
In order to provide integrated capabilities, ICS-CERT enhances
all aspect of preparedness and capabilities based on the specific
needs and requirements of the requesting customer. This
tailored approach provides scalable response to cybersecurity
challenges across critical infrastructures.
