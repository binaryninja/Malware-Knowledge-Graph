Ransomware-as-a-service: The pandemic within a
pandemic
intel471.com/blog/ransomware-as-a-service-2020-ryuk-maze-revil-egregor-doppelpaymer

Ransomware is a massive problem. But you already knew that.
Technical novices, along with seasoned cybersecurity professionals, have witnessed over the
past year a slew of ransomware events that have devastated enterprises around the world.
Even those outside of cybersecurity are now familiar with the concept: criminals behind a
keyboard have found a way into an organization’s system, prevented anyone from actually
using it by locking it up, and won’t let anyone resume normal activity until the organization
pays a hefty fee.
As economies around the world teeter on the edge of disaster as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, the onslaught of ransomware attacks in 2020 has compounded civil society’s
ability to carry on business as usual. Corporations, governments, schools and everything in
between have constantly been in the crosshairs of underground criminal groups, often left
with very little recourse if they find their systems have been locked.
That lack of recourse doesn’t mean there’s an absence of effort to beat the bad guys. But even
for seasoned professionals, it’s a challenge to measure and quantify just how bad
ransomware has gotten. While incidents continue to come to light, there is a lot the
cybersecurity industry doesn’t know: the volume of attacks, average cost of remediation and
organizations who choose to stay silent once an attack has occurred.
What is known is that the criminal groups behind ransomware are flourishing, creating new
variants and offering access on underground markets to anyone that has access to corporate
networks and a desire to make a substantial amount of illicit money. Intel 471 has been
tracking over 25 different ransomware-as-a-service crews over the past year, ranging from
well-known groups that have become synonymous with ransomware, to newly-formed
variants that have risen from the failures of old, to completely new variants that may have the
ability to unseat the current top-level cabals.
The following is an examination of Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) crews that have grown
over the past year. This is not meant to be a definitive measure of the ransomware scene, as
what could be considered “damaging” — payment amount, system downtime,
communications with attackers — could vary by crew or incident. Additionally, there are
known private gangs operating in tight, close-knit criminal circles using direct and private
communication channels that we have little visibility into.

What we are aiming to do is shine light on an area where relative darkness has led to a
staggering amount of criminals running roughshod over enterprises, escaping with people’s
hard-earned money while facing very limited consequences. By speaking publicly on these
operations, society as a whole can get a better understanding of the rising problem at hand.
TIER 3: Emerging RaaS Crews
We can verify that the following variants have been created and are being sold on a RaaS
model, but at the present time, there is limited to no information on successful attacks,
volume of attacks, payments received or cost of mitigation.

TIER 2: Rising Powers
The following variants have been tied to a number of confirmed attacks, the frequency of
which have grown over 2020. A number of these variants have utilized blogs to “name and
shame” victims who have refused to pay ransoms.

TIER 1: Most Wanted
These variants are among the most utilized, constantly showing up in enterprises that have
been publicly linked to an attack. The variants are often iterations of past RaaS operations
that were either shut down or broken up by law enforcement. All of these variants have
utilized blogs to “name and shame” victims who have refused to pay ransoms. In all, these
variants have pulled in hundreds of millions in ransoms -- a figure that may be low due to the
lack of reporting surrounding enterprises payment to crews.
DoppelPaymer
DoppelPaymer, around since 2019, is associated with the BitPaymer aka FriedEx
ransomware. CrowdStrike has highlighted some similarities between those variants,
speculating that DoppelPaymer might be the work of the former BitPaymer group members.
The ransomware itself is usually deployed manually after a network is compromised and
sensitive data is exfiltrated. The DoppelPaymer team operates a Tor-based “Dopple leaks”
blog, which is used to publish information about compromised companies and their stolen
data.
The crew is behind such notable attacks as those on Mexican energy giant Pemex and an IT
contractor that works with the U.S. federal government.
The most known and discussed victim of DoppelPaymer ransomware is one against
Düsseldorf University Clinic in September 2020. The actors actually wanted to target the
Düsseldorf University and addressed it in the ransom note, but ended up hitting the hospital.
When the perpetrators were made aware, they sent a digital key to get the hospital up and
running again.
DoppelPaymer has been used in over 125 ransomware incidents in 2020.
Egregor/Maze

3/6

As this report was being published, the crew behind the Maze ransomware service
announced it was shutting down its operations. There has been speculation that this group’s
affiliates will likely be funneled into the services behind Egregor ransomware. Egregor
follows a familiar pattern in its operations: Compromise corporate networks to steal sensitive
data and deploy ransomware, communicate with victims and demand ransoms, then dump
sensitive data on a blog when victim organizations refuse to pay the ransom.
There is evidence that Egregor is also linked to Sekhmet ransomware. Intel 471 researchers
found Egregor contained the same Base64 encoded data as Sekhmet where the last row
contained additional parameters from a compromised system. Researchers also found that
Egregor ransom notes were strikingly similar to ones used with Sekhmet.
Egregor was found in incidents at Crytek, Ubisoft and Barnes & Noble.
Intel 471 found that Maze was used in over 250 ransomware incidents in 2020. Egregor was
used in more than 200 incidents.
Netwalker
First detected in September 2019, NetWalker is one of the more prolific affiliate services Intel
471 has tracked. The actors behind it have spent 2020 using phishing emails that leverage the
impact and fear of the COVID-19 pandemic to lure victims into loading their malware onto
systems. In May, the operators launched a Tor-based blog to release sensitive data stolen
from victim organizations that refused to pay the requested ransom.
The actors used a fileless infection technique and allegedly could bypass the user account
control component of Windows 7 and newer operating systems. NetWalker could be operated
in two modes: In “network mode,” individual computers or the entire network could be held
for ransom and the victim could purchase a decryption tool with a master key or buy the
necessary keys to decrypt certain computers. In “individual mode”, a ransom was demanded
for a single computer at a time.
The most high-profile target hit by Netwalker is Michigan State University, which refused to
pay the ransom.
Netwalker has been tied to 143 ransomware incidents in 2020.
REvil
One of the most ubiquitous ransomware variants on the market, deployments of REvil first
were observed on April 17, 2019, where attackers leveraged a vulnerability in Oracle
WebLogic servers tracked as CVE-2019-2725. Two months later, advertisements started
popping up on the XSS forum.

4/6

REvil has been one of the most active ransomware gangs in recent memory, claiming
responsibility for such attacks as those on U.K.-based financial service provider Travelex,
U.S.-based entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks and 23 local
governments in Texas.
One of the most common ways the group gains access to organizations is through remote
desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, such as the BlueGate vulnerability, which allows
remote code execution by an authorized user. The representative admittedly preferred to use
information stealers to obtain remote access credentials, which are then used to secure an
initial foothold in company networks. In the case of the Travelex and Grubman Shire
Meiselas & Sacks attacks, the representative said networks were compromised by exploiting
outdated Citrix and Pulse Secure remote access software, with the actors allegedly gaining
access to an entire network in "about three minutes."
While the group carries out attacks on its own, it has found the RaaS model brings back more
money. Affiliates are responsible for gaining access to target networks, downloading valuable
files and deploying the actual ransomware, while the REvil gang handles victim negotiations
and blackmailing, ransom collection and distribution. This model has apparently led to
skyrocketing profits: according to the REvil representative, one affiliate's earnings rose from
about US$20,000 to US $30,000 per target with another RaaS offering to about US $7
million to $8 million per target in only six months after joining forces with REvil.
Intel 471 has linked REvil to 230 ransomware attacks in 2020.
Ryuk
The name “Ryuk” could arguably be categorized as synonymous with ransomware, as the
variant is one of the most popular, with a strong affiliate program and a large list of victims.
It is often delivered as the last action in the chain of infections brought on by dueling use of
the Trickbot botnet and Emotet malwares. (Intel 471 has previously covered that
relationship.) Recently, we have also witnessed that Ryuk is delivered through the Bazar
loader.
Affiliates follow a model in their attacks: Hiring actors to launch spam campaigns to deliver
the actor's banking malware. Then, another set of actors conduct privilege escalation attacks
within compromised corporate networks. Then, teams of as many of five deploy the
ransomware and handle negotiations with victims.
Ryuk has exploded over the past year, responsible for millions of ransomware incidents
around the world. Some security researchers estimate that Ryuk has been found in as much
as one-third of ransomware attacks launched this year.

5/6

One of the biggest threats from Ryuk this year has been focused on the healthcare sector. The
attack that drew the most headlines was the attack on Universal Health Services, one of the
biggest hospital systems in the United States.
While the cybersecurity community recognizes the threat all of these groups present, the
criminals are only one part of the picture. In our next entry, Intel 471 will examine what a
business goes through once it has to recover from a ransomware attack.
