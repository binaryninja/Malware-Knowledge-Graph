In the process of monitoring changes in the threat
landscape, we get a clearer insight into the way threat
actors work behind the schemes. In this case we dig
deeper into the possible connection between
cyberattacks by focusing on the similarities an unnamed
threat actor shares with Confucius, Patchwork, and
another threat actor called Bahamut. For the sake of this
report, we will call this unnamed threat actor “Urpage.”
What sets Urpage attacks apart is its targeting of InPage,
a word processor for Urdu and Arabic languages. However, its Delphi backdoor component,
which it has in common with Confucius and Patchwork, and its apparent use of Bahamutlike malware, is what makes it more intriguing as it connects Urpage to these other known
threats. In our previous entry, we already covered the Delphi component in the context of
the Confucius and Patchwork connection. We mentioned Urpage as a third unnamed threat
actor connected to the two. This time, we look into Urpage to gain a deeper insight into the
way several threat actors’ actions intersect.
The Bahamut Link
Fake websites
The link between Bahamut and Urpage can be best discussed by way of the multiple
malicious Android samples that matched Bahamut’s code and had C&C belonging to the
Urpage infrastructure. Some of these C&C websites also act as phishing sites that lure
users into downloading these very applications. The threat actor sets up these fake
websites describing the application and linking to the Google Play Store to download it, like
in the case of the malicious website, pikrpro[.]eu, seen below

Another sample website involved the use of a closely copied version of an existing website,
with slight changes in the logo and options above the page. The download links were also
replaced to download the malicious Android application instead.

Upon writing this entry, we’ve coordinated with Google to ensure that the malicious
applications these C&C sites advertise are no longer available for download on the Google
Play Store. It is important to note however, that not all C&C websites for Urpage advertise
malicious applications. Some simply contain a random template with empty categories,
likely as a ploy to hide its malicious activities.

Android targeting
As with Bahamut applications, once downloaded and executed, it showed multiple
malicious features that deal with stealing information. Some of these features are listed
below.
Retrieves basic information like network information and MAC address from an
infected phone
SMS stealing
Contacts stealing
Audio recording
GPS location retrieval
Steals files with the specific extensions, although not all samples target these
extensions.

Of note is one specific application that had a different purpose from the others. This
application has the same encryption routine as other Urpage applications. Instead of
stealing documents or images, it works on top of a modified version of the legitimate
Threema, an end-to-end encrypted messaging application, to steal screenshots of
messages.
This application has the same icon and label as the legitimate Threema. Once launched, it
drops a modified APK version of Threema and prompts the user to install the application.
The malicious application then hides its icon on the device but still runs in the background,
while the modified Threema works like normal. Unknown to the user, the code in the
modified Threema allows it to take screenshots of itself every 10 seconds. These images
are stored in the location/sdcard/Android/data/ch.threema.app/DataData directory, while
the “dropper” or the malicious application working in the background uploads the images to
the C&C for the threat actor to access.

Other activities
Aside from acting as a C&C and distributing Bahamut-like malware, some of these
websites also serve as the host for other malicious documents. These other activities
further establish the link of Urpage — and consequently Bahamut — to other threat actors.
Take, for example, the previously mentioned pikrpro[.]eu. This C&C website also acts as
host not only for the malicious Android application but also for two other malicious
documents listed here.
A malicious RTF file that exploits the CVE-2017-8750 and drops a malicious VB
backdoor with C&C appswonder[.]info
A malicious InPage file that exploits CVE-2017-12824 and drops two files, one nonmalicious, and one malicious VB backdoor with C&C referfile[.]com
Talos recently reported both C&C domain names with one type of campaign that targets
iOS and involves MDM, and another type using VB and Delphi backdoors. This leads us
back to the Confucius and Patchwork link.
The Confucius Link
In our previous entry, we already discussed how Confucius used the same Delphi file
stealer as Urpage. Digging into Urpage, we found another link—two malicious RTF files that
exploit different vulnerabilities but download a similar script (detected as
TROJ_POWLOAD.GAA) containing two base64-encoded URLs. One of the URLs is for the
decoy document, while the other one is for the payload.
One of the RTF files was found in a server related to Confucius
(f1a54dca2fdfe59ec3f537148460364fb5d046c9b4e7db5fc819a9732ae0e063, detected as
TROJ_CVE201711882.AG), while the other one
(434d34c0502910c562f5c6840694737a2c82a8c44004fa58c7c457b08aac17bd,detected
as Mal_CVE20170199-2) downloaded a VB Backdoor that pings back to twitck[.]com, a
domain name belonging to Urpage.
The Patchwork Link
Patchwork also uses the Delphi file stealer as a similarity with Urpage, which suggests the
4/8

three groups are somehow related. But this link is further fortified by the Android
applications we found whose code is like that of Bahamut, with the C&C matching the usual
name registration pattern of Patchwork’s group, as well as an infrastructure close to an old
Patchwork domain. Of note was how the C&C was not encrypted in the application code,
despite the fact that it contained the same encryption routines as other samples.
Patchwork has also recently employed Android malware in its attacks, with its use of a
customized version of AndroRAT.
Summary
The many similarities and connections show that threat actors do not work in isolation, and
that attacks do not necessarily appear from out of nowhere. This may even suggest that a
single development team may be behind this attack — maybe a single paid group that has
sold its tools and services to other groups with different goals and targets.We’ve
summarized all the mentioned findings in the table below.

Targets
We did not find Urpage victims in our telemetry, likely because of the targeted nature of
these attacks. However, the domains used by Urpage provided hints about its target.
For one, there is the domain pikrpro[.]eu and its subdomains—the
islamicfinderfeedback[.]pikrpro[.]eu and the memrifilesforinfo[.]pikpro[.]eu. The two pose as
legitimate groups and websites that provide services to Islam followers and users from the
5/8

Middle East.
Additionally, many of the files related to the Urpage domains are auto-extractable files that
drop Delphi or VB backdoor and open a decoy document. The decoy documents tell more
about Urpage’s possible targets, as it contains text from articles about the region of
Kashmir. The header for a sample document can be seen below.

The documents can also be image files with the same theme, as can be seen here.

Multiple Android applications further drive this notion, as they provide services based on
the interests of users in that region. They have a malicious application that provides
services for religion, as well as popular sports in the region.

Solutions and Mitigation
Taking note of these similarities and connections can help organizations and users in their
continued defense against Urpage, Bahamut, Confucius, and Patchwork. The connection of
Urpage to the other three threat actors demonstrate that cyberattacks don’t exist in silos
and that it hints at a circulation of knowledge and technologies that help in the continuing
evolution of different malicious campaigns. Given this knowledge, organizations must be
more vigilant in monitoring threats, as changes in one may mean that changes in others
could follow.
Organizations can develop defenses against the social engineering component these four
7/8

threat actors have in common. Users should be able to identify the indicators of a social
engineering campaign. Paying close attention to the domain name of a website before
performing any further action can also help mitigate threats, including threats like Urpage
that have targeted victims.
As an additional defense against the growing use of malicious mobile applications,
enterprises and end users can benefit from multilayered mobile security solutions such
