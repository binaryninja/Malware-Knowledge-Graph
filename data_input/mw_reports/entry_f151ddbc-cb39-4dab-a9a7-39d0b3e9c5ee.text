Attack Prevention - Overview

• Network Security
• POS Security
• Administrator Accounts
• Incident Response

Visa Public

11

Network Security
• Apply a defense-in-depth approach to protect the most critical
resources on your network, including POS systems
• Limit access to only network ports and services that are necessary to
perform desired business functions
• Segregate the payment processing network from other non-payment
processing networks
• Users with administrative access should use two-factor authentication
when accessing the payment processing networks
• Apply access controls on the router configuration to limit
unauthorized traffic to the payment processing networks
• Implement strict inbound and outbound filtering on the firewall rule
sets

Visa Public

12

POS Security
• Implement P2P PEDs
• EMV capability
• Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED)
• Hardware-based encryption
• Install PA-DSS compliant payment applications
• Deploy the latest version of operating system and ensure it is up-todate with security patches, anti-virus, FIM, HIDS
• Perform a binary or checksum comparison
• Disable unnecessary ports and services, null sessions, default users
and guests
• Enable logging of events and make sure there is a process to
monitor logs on a daily basis

Visa Public

13

POS Security - Continued
• Implement least privileges and access controls lists (ACLs) on users
and applications on the system
• Implement a security policy that includes operating system security
configuration. The policy should include the following:
– Security installation guide
– Password management guide to manage users on the system
– Mechanism to ensure consistent security baseline on critical systems

Visa Public

14

Administrative Accounts
• Use two-factor authentication when accessing the payment
processing networks
• Limit administrative privileges on applications
• Periodically review systems (local and domain controllers) for
unknown and dormant users.
• Apply same security on database users

Visa Public

15

Incident Response
• Deploy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
• Review logs and offload to a dedicated server (e.g., syslog and in a
secure location where hackers can’t tamper with logs)
• Invest in an incident response team
• Knowledge
• Training
• Certification
• Test your incident response plan
• Implement IOC signatures on your solution

Visa Public

16

PIN Entry Device (PED) Tampering
Cases


Number of PED tampering cases increasing
– Criminals target merchants with certain PED models
• Attacks on older vulnerable PEDs and newer PED models
• Wireless models becoming a target
– Small and large merchants, often multiple stores, targeted
• Swap out PEDs with altered PEDs



Attacks are more sophisticated & technically advanced
– Recent attacks involved VeriFone Everest and Ingenico i3070 PED
models
– However new PED models are being targeted



Evidence of technology being exported globally
PED Tampering usually involves:
– A second mag stripe reader or
connection to existing reader

– Keypad membrane

– Additional circuit board(s)

– Flash memory chip or drive

Visa Public

– Bluetooth device

17

Preventive Measures for PED Tampering
•
•

Replace vulnerable PEDs as quickly as possible
Train staff to regularly inspect PEDs visually to identify anything abnormal
such as
•
•
•

•

Missing or altered seals or screws
Extraneous wiring, holes in the device, or the addition of labels
Overlay material used to mask damage from tampering

Ensure PEDs are physically secured / locked down to counters

Usage Best Practices:

Tampering Is a Crime
…and You Can Stop It”

18

Compromised PIN-Entry Device List
• Review PEDs in use to identify any known vulnerable devices
• Visa Bulletin available on www.visa.com/cisp
• Take precautions to secure all PEDs in use…or in storage

Visa Public

19

Merchant Best Practices to Prevent Skimming
1. Implement a terminal
authentication system to detect
internal serial number or
connectivity changes
2. Secure terminals / PEDs to
counters to prevent removal and
secure cable connections
3. Inspect and secure PEDs within
unattended self checkout lanes
4. Use terminal asset tracking
procedures for devices
deployed, stored and shipped
5. Secure stored PEDs and validate
inventory against asset records

TIP recognizes and incents merchant chip
investments, while maintaining expectation for
merchants to protect cardholder data

•

Mandate for U.S. acquirer processors and
sub-processor service providers to support
chip processing, effective April 1, 2013

•

Participation results in cost savings by waiving
the annual PCI DSS validation exercise

•

Acquirers must certify the ability to comply

•

Eligible merchants must meet all of the minimum
qualification criteria

•

Visa will require support of Field 55 and
additional related chip fields for VIP authorization
messages between the acquirer and Visa

•

Acquirers should also ensure downstream
connections certify to their own platforms prior
to the deadline

– PCI DSS compliance or remediation plan
– No storage of prohibited data
– At least 75 percent of merchants’ transactions
must originate from dual interface chip
terminals and can process end-to-end
chip transactions
– No involvement in cardholder data breach2

Liability Shift

•

Visa intends to establish a U.S. liability shift for domestic
and cross-border counterfeit POS transactions

•

If a card is contact chip-capable and the merchant has
not invested in chip, liability for counterfeit fraud will shift
to the Acquirer

Product Type

•

The chip card’s counterfeit fraud protection plus the liability
shift encourage issuer chip adoption by providing dynamic
authentication that helps better protect all parties

– Card-not-present transactions
– Lost-and-stolen fraud

What To Do If Compromised
• Take compromised system off the network
• If you must rebuild system, take a forensic image prior to
rebuild
• Review firewall configuration and disable any unnecessary
inbound and outbound traffic
• Pair down ACLs, ports and services between PCI and non-PCI
environment
• Create strict ACLs segmenting public facing systems and
backend database systems that house payment data (e.g.,
DMZ)
• Change all passwords on the network including applications
and local accounts
• Review all access to the payment processing environment and
terminate connectivity

What To Do If Compromised
• Notify your acquiring bank
• Engage a PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)
