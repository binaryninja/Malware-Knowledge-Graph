Between January and February, we observed a multi-staged, targeted attack campaign
against energy companies around the world, with a focus on the Middle East. This attack
campaign used a new information stealer, detected by Symantec as Trojan.Laziok. Laziok
acts as a reconnaissance tool allowing the attackers to gather data about the compromised
computers.
The detailed information enables the attacker to make crucial decisions about how to
proceed further with the attack, or to halt the attack. During the course of our research, we
found that the majority of the targets were linked to the petroleum, gas and helium
industries, suggesting that whoever is behind these attacks may have a strategic interest in
the affairs of the companies affected.

How it begins
The initial infection vector involves the use of spam emails coming from the moneytrans[.]eu
domain, which acts as an open relay Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. These
emails include a malicious attachment packed with an exploit for the Microsoft Windows
Common Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).
This vulnerability has been exploited in many different attack campaigns in the past, such
as Red October. Symantec and Norton products had protection in place against these
exploits at the time of the targeted attack as Bloodhound.Exploit.457 and Web Attack:
Microsoft Common Controls CVE-2012-0158.
If the user opens the email attachment, which is typically an Excel file, then the exploit code
is executed. If the exploit succeeds, it drops Trojan.Laziok, kicking off the infection process.
Infection
The Trojan hides itself in the %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\All
Users\Application Data\System\Oracle directory, making new folders and renaming itself
with well-known file names such as:

Trojan.Laziok then begins its reconnaissance process by collecting system configuration
data such as:
Computer name
Installed software
RAM size
Hard disk size
GPU details
CPU details
Antivirus software
The collected information is then sent to the attackers. Once the attackers received the
system configuration data, including details of any installed antivirus software, they then
infect the computer with additional malware. In this campaign, the attackers distributed
customized copies of Backdoor.Cyberat and Trojan.Zbot which are specifically tailored for
the compromised computer’s profile. We observed that the threats were downloaded from a
few servers operating in the US, UK, and Bulgaria.
The group behind the attack does not seem to be particularly advanced, as they exploited
an old vulnerability and used their attack to distribute well-known threats that are available
in the underground market. However, many people still fail to apply patches for
vulnerabilities that are several years old, leaving themselves open to attacks of this kind.
From the attacker’s perspective, they don’t always need to have the latest tools at their
disposal to succeed. All they need is a bit of help from the user and a lapse in security
operations through the failure to patch.
Protection and prevention
Symantec and Norton products have the following protections against this campaign:
Antivirus
Intrusion prevention system
Gateway protection
Trojan.Mdropper
Our antispam technology detects the emails through generic Brightmail Rules.
Best practices
Users should also adhere to the following best practices to avoid malware infections
through spam campaigns:
Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.
Avoid opening attachments in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.

5/6

Use comprehensive security software, such as Symantec Endpoint Protection or
Norton Security, to protect yourself from attacks of this kind.
Take a security layered approach for better protection.
Keep your security software up to date.
Apply patches for installed software on a timely basis.
