My previous post on the Russian (offensive) Cyber Operations Groups became more popular
than what I expected, so I decided to do something similar for other nation-state actors with
multiple intelligence organizations performing offensive cyber operations. So, I picked the
United States as the second one, and hopefully will continue with more of these in the future.
In the case of the US it was harder since there are very limited details publicly available. The
main sources that I used for this one were (full list of sources used below the diagram):
Government leaks (E. Snowden, Wikileaks, Shadow Brokers, etc.)
Statements from government officials in reputable news outlets
You might notice that I didn’t expand the CYBERCOM (which is massive) and the reason is
that although it’s publicly known that it now performs offensive cyber operations, there is no
publicly known APT association. So, I decided to avoid making this a huge diagram for no
reason. Same with the NSA that has multiple other divisions/offices performing cyber
operations but there is no publicly known APT associated with them either.
I hope I got it right, but if you notice any mistakes, missing details or incorrect information
please let me know to update it accordingly.
