Last year, the Bitdefender Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab started analysis of a new
password- and data-stealing operation based around a rootkit driver digitally signed with a
possibly stolen certificate. The operation, partially described in a recent article by Tencent,
primarily targeted Chinese territory until recently, when it broke out around the world.
Despite the sophistication, this attack looks like a work in progress, with many components
in the early stage of development. Although the campaign has not reached the magnitude
of the Zacinlo adware campaign, it is already infecting users worldwide.
We discovered that the operators of this rootkit-enabled spyware are continuously testing
new components on already-infected users and regularly making minor improvement to old
components. The various components can serve different purposes or take different
approaches to achieving their goals. Some of the most important components shipped with
the malware can achieve the following:
Extract cookies and steal login credentials from Google Chrome, Chromium, Mozilla
Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Baidu Browser and Yandex
Browser.
Steal a user’s payment accounts from his Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb
webpages.
Send friend requests to other accounts, from the user’s Facebook account.

3/5

Send phishing messages to the victim’s Facebook friends containing malicious APKs
used to infect Android users as well.
Steal login credentials for the user’s account on Steam.
Inject JavaScript adware in Internet Explorer.
Install Chrome/Opera extensions to inject JavaScript adware on these browsers as
well.
Exfiltrate browsing history.
Silently display ads or muted YouTubevideos to users via Chrome. We found some
droppers that can install Chrome if it is not already on the victim’s computer.
Subscribe users to YouTube video channels.
Download and execute any payload.
