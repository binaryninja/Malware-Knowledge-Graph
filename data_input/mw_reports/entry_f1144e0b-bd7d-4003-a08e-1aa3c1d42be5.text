This morning, Sophos published a report about a relatively small player in the ransomware
space. The ransomware, called Matrix, doesn’t produce the high returns of the better-known
SamSam (whose creators were indicted by US law enfocement authorities last fall), and it
doesn’t have the “get rich quick” spin of the better known GandCrab ransomware-as-aservice. What it does demonstrate, however, is that a small team of malware developers and
attackers can successfully leverage the low hanging fruit of Remote Desktop to breach
networks and cause damage and mayhem.
You can download the report now; Analysts may wish to retrieve our list of Matrix
ransomware IoCs they can use for threat hunting in their environment. Our friends at Naked
Security have also published a story about Matrix.
Matrix is a curious case, because while its creators clearly understand the principles involved
in creating a ransomware Trojan, their creation demonstrates a mix of differing levels of
competencies in carrying out attacks. Unlike its more high-profile brethren, Matrix has not
adopted techniques that would permit it to spread widely inside networks, where machines
vulnerable to wormable exploits (like EternalBlue) might be running. But the constant level of
improvement indicates that may not remain the case forever.

The biggest problem Matrix highlights is that, despite the wide publicity that SamSam, Ryuk,
and other targeted ransomware have gained, large enterprise networks still rely on security
by obscurity, and permit Windows computers with passwords of dubious strength to be
exposed to the unfiltered internet, where they can be attacked from outside with impunity.
These machines then can become a foothold to the attacker, who can use it to target bigger
fish inside the firewall.

Post attack interaction
In its earliest incarnations, Matrix curiously attempted to replicate an earlier generation of
ransomware. The now-abandoned ransom note claimed that the ransomware originated with
law enforcement, a practice that hasn’t been used for many years. The more recent versions
of the malware now have given up this pretense and simply make demands.

Early versions of the ransomware used an email address with the phrase “The Matrix has
you” – a reference to the film trilogy of the same name
The malware authors ask the victims to contact them for the ransom amount, so it’s unknown
at this time how much they’ve earned. We do know, however, that for much of the time that
Matrix existed, its attackers had a preferred method of contact which is now unavailable to
them: A niche private messaging service called bitmsg.me used to afford them some
measure of privacy, but after that service shut down last month, the attackers fell back on
using email accounts on free webmail services exclusively.
After running a sample in a test environment, research analyst and reverse engineer Luca
Nagy, the report’s author and the primary investigator for this project, contacted the attackers
at the email addresses they provided. The attackers demanded $2500 initially, and
threatened to raise the ransom to $3500 if the payment wasn’t received right away, or
(notably) if the victim asked “stupid questions.”

Note to self: Only ask smart questions
After Luca failed to respond to emails for several days, the attackers emailed back, offering
her a discount price of $1000 if she still wanted to decrypt her files.

Technical capabilities
The Matrix ransomware package has a huge resource section; Its creators have embedded
the kitchen sink of what it might need in these resources: instructions, tools, and documents
like the ransom note. The resource section also contains some of the cryptographic keys that
are used during the malicious encryption phase of the attack. Importantly, the creators have
engaged in the questionable application of cryptographic principles, using the same,
hardcoded string as both the key and as a nonce in the encryption algorithm.

Some of the domain names used for Matrix command-and-control may be a play on the
Russian word for “Americans” and were hosted by an ISP in Russia. Data source: VirusTotal
Also included in the resource section are several components of what more competent
ransomware creators have built into their competing malware: There’s a priority list of file
extensions targeted for attack, another list of filesystem paths and files to be excluded, and a
check to make sure the ransomware doesn’t accidentally run on a machine that is being
used in Russia or any of several former-Soviet republics, based on the language settings of
the operating system. Unfortunately for the attackers, that means all it takes to prevent the
malware from running is to set a system preference to the Kazakh language, for instance.
The malware’s creators also wanted to try to evade detection by endpoint antivirus products,
so they eventually also added an exclusion list that prevents the malware from encrypting
anything in a folder named SOPHOS (or named after any of several other AV products). The
law of unintended consequences rules here: if you put your documents in a folder named
after any of these companies, Matrix won’t encrypt them.
After the malicious encryption is complete, the malware invokes one of the resources it has
embedded — a Windows shell .cmd file — to securely wipe deleted, unencrypted files.
The .cmd file uses a standard Windows executable called cipher.exe to do this. Windows
uses cipher.exe to manage encrypted files on NTFS partitions, but it isn’t always needed. A
Group Policy rule that restricts the situations in which cipher.exe can be invoked would, at

4/5

the very least, give an incident responder a chance to recover the unencrypted files marked
as deleted from the hard drive.
But despite these many shortcomings, it’s not fair to say the ransomware isn’t harmful. It is
capable of doing damage to infected computers; Its only truly saving grace is that the
ransomware isn’t effective at spreading itself around rapidly.
It doesn’t hurt matters that Sophos products are able to detect its presence during the
earliest stages of infection, when the malware hasn’t yet had a chance to do any real
damage, but the fact that it takes some manual effort for the attackers to get Matrix onto
each computer does limit its effectiveness.
But the thing that would eliminate its effectiveness: Systems administrators need to block all
direct access to Windows machines whose RDP is accessible through the firewall (no matter
which port is it running on), and instead require users who need to remotely access their
computers connect to a VPN to do so.
