Vice Society is a financially motivated organization encompassing operators and
opportunistic intrusion sets known for intrusion, exfiltration and extorsion against a large
sample of victims since June 2021. The operator(s) of these alleged intrusion sets offer(s) an
active infrastructure as new victims are constantly added to the anonymized dedicated leak
site where data of the victims is exposed.
The actors affiliated with Vice Society leverage not only custom Vice Society branded
variants but also several ransomware-as-a-service payloads (BlackCat) as well as
purchased malware (Zeppelin) for conducting attack campaigns. Sometimes, affiliates do not

ransom paid. The overall TTPs are close to those usually encountered by Russian-speaking

extension and email contact which substantiates that Vice Society affiliates use customizable
