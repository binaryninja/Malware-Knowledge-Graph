Bitter APT adds Bangladesh to their targets
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/bitter-apt-adds-bangladesh-to-their.html

Cisco Talos has observed an ongoing malicious campaign since August 2021 from the
Bitter APT group that appears to target users in Bangladesh, a change from the
attackers' usual victims.
As part of this, there's a new trojan based on Apost Talos is calling "ZxxZ," that, among
other features, includes remote file execution capability.
Based on the similarities between the C2 server in this campaign with that of Bitter's
previous campaign, we assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is
operated by the Bitter APT group.

Executive Summary
Cisco Talos discovered an ongoing campaign operated by what we believe is the Bitter APT
group since August 2021. This campaign is a typical example of the actor targeting South
Asian government entities.
This campaign targets an elite unit of the Bangladesh's government with a themed lure
document alleging to relate to the regular operational tasks in the victim's organization. The
lure document is a spear-phishing email sent to high-ranking officers of the Rapid Action
Battalion Unit of the Bangladesh police (RAB). The emails contain either a malicious RTF
document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet weaponized to exploit known vulnerabilities.
Once the victim opens the maldoc, the Equation Editor application is automatically launched
to run the embedded objects containing the shellcode to exploit known vulnerabilities

described by CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802 — all in Microsoft
Office — then downloads the trojan from the hosting server and runs it on the victim's
machine. The trojan masquerades as a Windows Security update service and allows the
malicious actor to perform remote code execution, opening the door to other activities by
installing other tools. In this campaign, the trojan runs itself but the actor has other RATs and
downloaders in their arsenal.
Such surveillance campaigns could allow the threat actors to access the organization's
confidential information and give their handlers an advantage over their competitors,
regardless of whether they're state-sponsored.

Bitter threat actor
Bitter, also known as T-APT-17, is a suspected South Asian threat actor. They have been
active since 2013, targeting energy, engineering and government sectors in China, Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia. In their latest campaign, they have extended their targeting to Bangladeshi
government entities.
Bitter is mainly motivated by espionage. The adversary typically downloads malware onto
compromised endpoints from their hosting server via HTTP and uses DNS to establish
contact with the command and control. Bitter is known for exploiting known vulnerabilities in
victims' environments. For example, in 2021, security researchers discovered that the
adversary was exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2021-28310, a security flaw in
Microsoft's Desktop Manager. Bitter is known to target both mobile and desktop platforms.
Their arsenal mainly contains Bitter RAT, Artra downloader, SlideRAT and AndroRAT.

Infrastructure
The actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and
several domains that host the adversary's malware, which is outlined below.

2/22

Domains hosting Bitter APT malware.
The SSL thumbprints are unique for each domain's certificate. We compiled a list of these
SSL thumbprints in the IOCs section of the report. The timeline below shows the various
domains based on their certificate creation date.

3/22

The C2 host is helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com. Its WhoIs record indicates that the domain
autodefragapp[.]com registered it in November 2020, and later updated it on Nov. 3, 2021.
We have seen the actor use this C2 in previous campaigns.
The C2 domain resolved to 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 during the period of the campaign. This is a
legitimate IP address for the AWS Global Accelerator networking service. Usually, the AWS
Global Accelerator provides static IPs to the registrant, which allows the user to redirect
traffic to their application or host for improved performance. In this case, we believe that the
actor is using the AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 host, which is
parked behind the legitimate AWS service. We believe that the actor has employed this
technique to conceal their identity.

4/22

We assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is operated by Bitter based on the
use of the same C2 IP address from previous campaigns and similarities in the decrypted
strings of the payload, such as module names, payload executable name, paths and the
constants.

The 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 IP also hosts mswsceventlog[.]net, according to Cisco Umbrella, a
domain that was previously reported as Bitter's C2 server in a campaign against Pakistani
government organizations.

The campaign
Cisco Talos observed an ongoing campaign operated by the Bitter APT group since August
2021 targeting Bangladeshi government personnel with spear-phishing emails. The email
contains a maldoc attachment and masquerades as a legitimate email. The sender asks the
target to review or verify the attached maldoc, which is either a call data record (CDR), a list
of phone numbers, or a list of registered cases. We have seen the actor use these themes in
phishing emails in the past.
The maldocs are an RTF document and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Examples of the
specific subjects of the phishing emails are below.
Subject: CDR
Subject: Application for CDR
Subject: List of Numbers to be verified
Subject: List of registered cases
The maldocs' file names are consistent with the phishing emails' themes, as seen in the list
of file names below:

Below are two spear-phishing email samples of this campaign.

Phishing email sample 1

Phishing email sample 2

6/22

The actor is using JavaMail with the Zimbra web client version 8.8.15_GA_4101 to send the
emails. Zimbra is a collaborative software suite that includes an email server and a web
client for messaging.

Phishing email header information.
The originating IP address and header information indicates the emails were sent from mail
servers based in Pakistan and the actor spoofed the sender details to make the email appear
as though it was sent from Pakistani government organizations. The actor exploited a
possible vulnerability in the Zimbra mail server. By modifying the Zimbra mail server
configuration file, a user can send emails from a non-existing email account/domain. We
have compiled a list of fake sender email addresses from this campaign:
cdrrab13bd@gmail[.]com
arc@desto[.]gov[.]pk
so.dc@pc[.]gov[.]pk
mem_psd@pc[.]gov[.]pk
chief_pia@pc[.]gov[.]pk
rab3tikatuly@gmail[.]com
ddscm2@pof[.]gov[.]pk

The infection chain
The infection chain begins with the spear-phishing email and either a malicious RTF
document or an Excel spreadsheet attachment. When the victim opens the attachment, it
launches the Microsoft Equation Editor application to execute the equations in the form of
OLE objects and connects to the hosting server to download and run the payload.

7/22

Malicious RTF infection chain summary.
In the case of a malicious Excel spreadsheet, when the victim opens the file, it launches the
Microsoft Equation Editor application to execute the embedded equation object and launches
the task scheduler to configure two scheduled tasks. One of the scheduled tasks downloads
the trojan "ZxxZ" into the public user's account space, while the other task runs the "ZxxZ".

Malicious Excel infection chain summary.

8/22

The payload runs as a Windows security update service on the victim's machine and
establishes communication with the C2 to remotely download and execute files in the victim's
environment.

RTF document
The Malicious RTF document is weaponized to exploit the stack overflow vulnerability CVE2017-11882, which enables arbitrary code execution on victims' machines running vulnerable
versions of Microsoft Office. Our previous blog outlines how this particular exploit works in
the victim's environment.

Malicious RTF document sample.
The RTF document is embedded with an OLE object with the class name "Equation 3.0." It
contains the shellcode as an equation formula created using Microsoft Equation Editor.

9/22

Embedded Microsoft Equation object.
When the victim opens the RTF file with Microsoft Word, it invokes the Equation Editor
application and executes the equation formula containing the Return-Oriented Programming
(ROP) gadgets. The ROP loads and executes the shell code located at the end of the
maldocs in an encrypted format that connects to the malicious host olmajhnservice[.]com
and downloads the payload from the URL hxxp[:]//olmajhnservice[.]/nxl/nx. The payload is
downloaded in the folder "C:\$Utf&quot created by the shellcode and runs as a process on
the victim's machine.

Download URL captured during runtime of the maldoc.

Excel spreadsheet
The malicious Excel spreadsheet is weaponized to exploit the Microsoft Office memory
corruption vulnerabilities CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802.
When the victim opens the Excel spreadsheet, it launches the Microsoft Equation Editor
application to execute the embedded Microsoft Equation 3.0 objects.

10/22

Malicious Excel spreadsheet.
Once the Microsoft Equation Editor service executes the embedded objects, it invokes the
scheduled task service to configure the task scheduler with the commands shown below:
Task 1: Rdx

Task 2: RdxFac

The actor creates the folder "RdxFact '' in the Windows tasks folder and schedules two tasks
with the task names "Rdx '' and "RdxFac '' to run every five minutes. When the first task runs,
the victim's machine attempts to connect to the hosting server through the URL and, using
the cURL utility, downloads the "RdxFactory.exe" into the public user profile's music folder.
RdxFactory.exe is the trojan downloader.
After five minutes of execution of the first task, "Rdx,", the second task, "RdxFac,"runs to
start the payload.
Based on other related samples we discovered, the actor also uses different folder names,
tasks names and dropper file names in their campaigns.

11/22

We noticed that the actor is using the cURL command-line utility to download the payload in
the Windows environment. Systems running Windows 10 and later have the cURL utility,
which the actor abuses in this campaign.

The payload
The payload is a 32-bit Windows executable compiled in Visual C++ with a timestamp of
Sept. 10, 2021. We named the trojan "ZxxZ" based on the name of a separator that the
payload uses while sending information to the C2. This trojan is a downloader that
downloads and executes the remote file. The executables were seen with the filenames
"Update.exe", "ntfsc.exe" or "nx" in this campaign. They are either downloaded or dropped
into the victim's "local application data" folder and run as a Windows Security update with
medium integrity to elevate the privileges of a standard user.
The actor uses common encoding techniques to obfuscate strings in the WinMain function to
hide its behavior from static analysis tools.

WinMain function snippet.
The decryption function receives the encrypted strings and decrypts each character with the
XOR operation and stores the result in an array that will be returned to the caller function.

12/22

Decryption function.
The malware searches for the Windows Defender and Kaspersky antivirus processes in the
victim's machine by creating the snapshot of running processes using
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot and iterates through each process using API Process32First and
Process32Next.

13/22

WinMain() snippet showing antivirus process detection.
The information-gathering function gathers the victim's hostname, operating system product
name, and the victim's username and writes them into a memory buffer.

14/22

Information-gathering function.
The C2 communicating function at offset 401C50 is called from the two other requests
making functions to send the victim's information with the decrypted strings
"xnb/dxagt5avbb2.php?txt=" and "data1.php?id=" to C2 and receive the response.
The received response is a remote file saved into the "debug" folder and executed with the
API "ShellExecuteA". In our research debugging environment, the remote file is similar to the
trojan.
15/22

16/22

Requests making function 1 at offset 00401E00
17/22

Requests making function 1 at offset 00401E00.

Requests making function 2 at offset 00402130.

C2 communication
For C2 communication, first, the trojan sends the victim's computer name, user name, a
separator "ZxxZ" and the Windows version pulled from the registry. The server responds
back with data in the format <id><user>:"<Program name">.
Next, the malware requests the program data. The server sends back the data of the
Portable Executable effectively matching the pattern:<zero or more bytes>ZxxZ<PE data
minus the MZ>. It then saves the file to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Debug\<program name>.exe
and tries to execute it.

Request sent to C2.
If the download is successful, the server sends back the request with the opcode DN-S and,
in case of a failure, the opcode RN_E in their response. Based on our analysis, the opdoce
DN-S means "download successful" and RN_E stands for run error. If failed, the malware
attempts to download the program data 225 times, and after that, it will launch itself and exit.

Conclusion
18/22

Organizations should be vigilant about the highly motivated threat actors who are known to
conduct targeted attacks in their region. Threat actors usually emerge with smart techniques
to accomplish their adversarial objectives and we have seen such an attempt in this
campaign with the addition of a new variant to their arsenal.
In this current campaign, upon compromising the victim's machine and implanting the trojan
ZxxZ - which has remote file execution capability - the adversary can deploy and run other
tools from their arsenal to achieve their malicious objective.
Organizations should have a layered defense strategy with the implementation of the latest
detection rules and behavioral protections in their endpoint defense solutions - not only with
technical controls, but the organizations should have matured incident response plans and
have the organization's security posture streamlined to protect their environment against the
latest threats.
