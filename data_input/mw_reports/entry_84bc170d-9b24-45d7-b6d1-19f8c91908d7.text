January 21, 2022

The results from the 2021 Global Security Attitude Survey paint a bleak picture of how
organizations globally are feeling about the cybersecurity landscape before them.
Organizations are grappling with shortages of cybersecurity skills and a lack of capability to
detect and contain intrusions in a timely way. This comes against a backdrop of persistent
ransomware attacks, the increasing regularity of supply chain vulnerabilities and a large
attack surface due to sustained high levels of remote work.
Although these are legitimate concerns, the battle is not lost. Effective managed
cybersecurity services that include continuous threat hunting and rapid response can provide
organizations with an immediate injection of world-class capability to detect, disrupt and
contain serious hands-on-security threats at speed and at scale.

“Trusted” Entry Points Are No Match for Human Hunters
Many survey respondents (84%) predict that supply chain attacks could become one of the
biggest cyber threats facing their organization. This boils down to a fear of an adversary
gaining access through a trusted channel and going undetected. Sophisticated attacks of this
1/5

nature require a mix of automation and human expertise in the form of human-based threat
hunting. One of the strengths of threat hunting is that the ability to quickly and decisively
detect a threat is not contingent on the initial access vector. Whether initial access is
achieved via a supply chain attack, a vulnerable public-facing application or another trusted
entry point, CrowdStrike Falcon® OverWatch™ remains vigilant in hunting for postexploitation behavior that signals an interactive threat on an endpoint.

OverWatch recently uncovered interactive intrusion activity that followed the unintended
download of a suspected backdoored Zsh installation file. Zsh is a legitimate Unix shell and
was likely downloaded by the victim organization from a legitimate GitHub repository.
Upon download and installation of Zsh, a binary for the remote access utility NetSupport was
executed. Concurrently, the malicious installer also attempted to download additional
binaries and batch files from an external domain. OverWatch tracked the adversary as they
leveraged NetSupport to execute PowerShell commands to download a malicious DLL and
batch file from an adversary command-and-control (C2) server and execute basic network
reconnaissance commands. Later investigation found that the malicious DLL was modified to
include VBScript that, if loaded, would have attempted to disable and add a number of folder
exclusions to a third-party security tool.
This attempted intrusion highlights how adversaries abuse user trust in legitimate download
locations and exploit public edit settings on numerous GitHub repositories. Fortunately for
this victim organization, OverWatch’s continuous hunting quickly spotted the anomalous
activity based on threat hunting leads and known indicators of compromise (IOCs). Based on
this rapid detection, OverWatch provided the necessary context to the victim organization
enabling them to take swift remedial action.

Managed threat hunting delivers the human element that is crucial in detecting and
disrupting adversary activity designed to exploit trusted components in a victim environment.
Unlike solutions based exclusively on automated technology, human hunters approach their
analysis with informed skepticism. OverWatch looks for behaviors that are indicative of a
malicious presence in an environment. While the application or user activity involved with
initial access might fall within parameters that technology considers normal, hunting looks at
the broader context to detect even the faintest traces of malicious follow-on activity.

OverWatch and Falcon Complete Combine Forces to Stop
Ransomware in Its Tracks
The 2021 survey also revealed that the persistent threat of ransomware attacks remains
organizations’ most pressing cybersecurity concern, a concern that is firmly based in their
lived experience. Two-thirds of the organizations surveyed had fallen victim to at least one
ransomware attack in the preceding 12 months. This highlights how critical it is for
organizations to have comprehensive security solutions in place that ensure that
ransomware attempts are met with swift and decisive action.
OverWatch and CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete™ recently disrupted a ransomware attempt
against a victim organization’s domain controller. An affiliate of the LockBit ransomware as a
service (RaaS), run by BITWISE SPIDER, targeted the domain controller by exploiting the
Zerologon vulnerability. The adversary connected to the domain controller remotely from a
host on the network that did not have Falcon coverage. Thanks to the Falcon platform’s rich
telemetry on covered workloads and OverWatch’s proactive threat hunting, the attack was
immediately detected. Within minutes, OverWatch identified the adversary’s presence and
began investigating.
Having leveraged the exploit to obtain domain admin privileges, the adversary undertook
initial discovery actions and created a new domain account to facilitate persistence and
lateral movement. In under 20 minutes, the adversary used their new domain account to
move laterally, via RDP, to another domain controller on the network, where they changed
the “administrator” account’s password. By this time, OverWatch hunters were already in
direct communication and coordination with Falcon Complete responders to begin stopping
the attack.
Less than 10 minutes after the breakout, the adversary deployed and attempted to execute a
novel binary. Further analysis performed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team found the
binary to be a variant of LockBit 2.0. Thanks to the Falcon platform’s prevention capabilities,
the attempted LockBit execution was prevented, ensuring that this CrowdStrike customer did
not become another one of BITWISE SPIDER’s many victims.
A Bit About LockBit

3/5

LockBit is developed by an adversary that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks as BITWISE
SPIDER, who provides their ransomware to affiliates in a RaaS model. BITWISE SPIDER
has recently and quickly become a significant player in the big game hunting (BGH)
landscape. Their dedicated leak site (DLS) has received the highest number of victims
posted each month since July 2021 compared to other adversary DLSs due to the growing
popularity and effectiveness of LockBit 2.0.
The Falcon platform is finely tuned to identify known malicious behaviors associated with
ransomware. Despite the novel nature of the binary used in this attempted intrusion, the
Falcon platform anticipated and immediately prevented the unknown threat from executing
using a combination of artificial intelligence, behavioral detection and machine learning
algorithms.
Meanwhile, OverWatch tracked the adversary at every turn, providing context-rich
information about the adversary’s movements to Falcon Complete, whose responders
notified the customer and rapidly performed their response. Falcon Complete began by
rapidly network containing the affected hosts, completely cutting off the adversary’s remote
access. They also disabled the domain account created by the adversary and deployed a
custom IOC hash block across the entire environment for the observed LockBit variant. To
further assist the customer, Falcon Complete analysts delivered specific recommendations
for further hardening of the network, including guidance, removing the adversary-created
account, resetting the affected “administrator” account and fully patching the compromised
domain controller.
Thanks to the unrivaled security combination of the Falcon platform and the OverWatch,
CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon Complete teams, the adversary was thwarted. This
coordinated response effectively stopped the intrusion before the customer suffered any
significant impact — protecting them against a serious eCrime threat that is growing all too
prevalent.
The findings from last year’s survey prove that it is a matter of when, not if, an organization
will fall victim to an attempted ransomware attack. Yet, respondents’ self-reported estimated
time to detect an intrusion has increased to an average of 146 hours, or over 6 days. Having
expert managed services on your side makes the difference when minutes matter. The
combination of OverWatch’s unrivaled ability to uncover adversary activity and Falcon
Complete’s expert and timely response is proven to disrupt ransomware attempts before the
adversary can do damage.

Managed Services Plug the Skills Gap
Amid these persistent threats, organizations report difficulty in finding staff with the skills
needed to establish and maintain a comprehensive security posture. Managed services can
deliver an immediate injection of security capability that can begin to pay dividends from Day

customer environments.
CrowdStrike’s managed services provide benefits that cannot easily be replicated with an inhouse solution. Because CrowdStrike analysts have access to cloud-scale telemetry
encompassing trillions of events per day, they have unparalleled visibility across the entire
customer install base. This allows hunters to rapidly identify anomalous activity, which
ensures every customer benefits from near-real time insights into active threats. Both
OverWatch and Falcon Complete are powered by CrowdStrike’s global threat intelligence,
bringing critical context to the detection and response process. Crucially, all of this is
delivered with 24/7/365 coverage, providing comprehensive security when it is most needed:
ALWAYS.
Finally, a partnership with CrowdStrike’s managed services equips organizations with roundthe-clock access to elite resources. OverWatch’s expert hunters deliver context-rich alerts
that empower organizations to rapidly contain threats and remediate their environments with
confidence. For organizations leveraging the power of Falcon Complete, expert responders
will work in lock-step with OverWatch threat hunters to rapidly and surgically remediate
malicious activity on an organization’s behalf.
Managed services can be your fast track to a comprehensive, mature endpoint security
program that equips you to face the most pressing global security challenges into 2022 and
beyond.
