If you’re running a business online, few things can be as disruptive or destructive to your
brand as someone stealing your company’s domain name and doing whatever they wish with
it. Even so, most major Web site owners aren’t taking full advantage of the security tools
available to protect their domains from being hijacked. Here’s the story of one recent victim
who was doing almost everything possible to avoid such a situation and still had a key
domain stolen by scammers.
The U.S. government — along with a number of leading security companies — recently
warned about a series of highly complex and widespread attacks that allowed suspected
Iranian hackers to siphon huge volumes of email passwords and other sensitive data from
multiple governments and private companies. But to date, the specifics of exactly how that
attack went down and who was hit have remained shrouded in secrecy.
This post seeks to document the extent of those attacks, and traces the origins of this
overwhelmingly successful cyber espionage campaign back to a cascading series of
breaches at key Internet infrastructure providers.
