Emergent threats evolve quickly. We will update this blog with new information as it comes to
light and we are able to verify it. Erick Galinkin, Ted Samuels, Zach Dayton, Eoin Miller,
Caitlin Condon, Stephen Fewer, Spencer McIntyre, and Christiaan Beek all contributed to
this blog.
On Wednesday, March 29, 2023, multiple security firms issued warnings about malicious
activity coming from a legitimate, signed binary from communications technology company
3CX. The binary, 3CXDesktopApp, is popular video-conferencing software available for
download on all major platforms. Several analyses have attributed the threat campaign to
state-sponsored threat actors, and security firms have observed malicious activity in both
Windows and Mac environments.
Rapid7’s threat research teams analyzed the 3CXDesktopApp Windows binary and
confirmed that the 3CX MSI installer drops the following files: 3CXDesktopApp.exe, a benign
file that loads the backdoored ffmpeg.dll, which reads an RC4-encrypted blob after the
hexadecimal demarcation of fe ed fa ce in d3dcompiler.dll. The RC4-encrypted blob in
d3dcompiler.dll is executable code that is reflectively loaded and retrieves .ico files with
appended Base64-encoded strings from GitHub. The encoded strings appear to be
command-and-control (C2) communications. There is a non-exhaustive list of indicators of
compromise (IOCs) at the end of this blog.
Rapid7 reached out to GitHub’s security team the evening of March 29 about the GitHub
repository being used as adversary infrastructure in this campaign. As of 9:40 PM ET, the
malicious user has been suspended and the repository is no longer available.
Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response (MDR) has observed the backdoored 3CX
installer and components in several customer environments as of March 29, 2023. Rapid7
MDR is in contact with customers that we believe may be impacted.

Mitigation Guidance
Official guidance from 3CX confirms that the following clients and versions are affected:
Electron Windows App (shipped in Update 7) versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416
Electron Mac App versions 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407, and 18.12.416
1/4

As of March 30 at 11 AM ET, 3CX has not confirmed which versions of the 3CXDesktopApp
are definitively unaffected.
Update March 31: 3CX has released new versions of their Windows and Mac Electron app
as of March 31. Their update included the following statement:
"The Electron App update that we are releasing today is considered to be secure but there is
no guarantee given that we only had 24 hours to make the necessary adjustments."
Rapid7 is continuing to advise customers to pursue a conservative mitigation strategy of
uninstalling 3CXDesktopApp on all platforms and removing any artifacts left behind.
Users should retroactively hunt for indicators of compromise and block known-bad domains.
There is a non-exhaustive list of known-bad domains and malicious file hashes at the end of
this blog.
3CX has a browser-based Progressive Web App (PWA) that does not require the user to
download an executable file. Users should leverage this PWA for the time being instead of
downloadable clients. 3CX is intermittently issuing updated guidance here.

Rapid7 customers
The following new rules have been added for Rapid7 InsightIDR and Managed Detection &
Response (MDR) customers and will alert on known-bad hashes and file versions of the
backdoored executable, as well as known-bad domains in WEB_PROXY and DNS logs:
Suspicious Web Request - 3CX Desktop Supply Chain Compromise
Suspicious DNS Request - 3CX Desktop Supply Chain Compromise
Suspicious Process - 3CX Desktop Supply Chain Compromise
InsightVM and Nexpose customers can use Query Builder (asset.software.product
CONTAINS '3CX Desktop App') or a Filtered Asset Search (Software Name contains 3CX
Desktop App) to find assets in their environment with 3CX installed. The March 30 content
release also contains a check that will report any installed version of 3CX Desktop App as
vulnerable. This check may be refined as new information regarding vulnerable versions
comes to light.
A Velociraptor artifact is available here.

Indicators of compromise
A non-exhaustive list of known-bad domains is below. We advise blocking these
immediately:
