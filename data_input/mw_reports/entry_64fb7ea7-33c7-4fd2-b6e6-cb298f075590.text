NOTES:
I generated traffic baseed on a blog post by @Zerophage1337 about Rig EK (link)
because I wanted to catch the Rig EK malware payload.
The Rig EK payload seems to be Bunitu based on the post-infection traffic.
This is similar to a post from Zerophage on 2017-03-20 and appears to be the same
campaign.
