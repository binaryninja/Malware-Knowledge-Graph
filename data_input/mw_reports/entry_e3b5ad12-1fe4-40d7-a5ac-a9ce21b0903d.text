In this repo you can find a small tool called BlackMatter_hash.py to recover the hashes
hardcoded in different samples of the BlackMatter ransomware.

Usage
In order to work it needs a file with the hashes each one in a different line and the dictionary
with the processes to bruteforce with the same format.
python BlackMatter_hash.py -d HASHES_FILE -t DICTIONARY_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
python BlackMatter_hash.py -m MODULE_NAME -a API_NAME
python BlackMatter_hash.py -s STRING

File Format
The script will calculate the hash of every string in the dictionary file.
Hashes can be prepend with 0x or not and they have to be in hexadecimal.
Lines starting with '#' will be ignored.
