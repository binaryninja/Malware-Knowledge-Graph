The cybercriminal underground hasn’t forgotten about
financial services

It is a well-worn cliche in cybersecurity: criminals prey on banks and financial services
because that’s where the money is. In 2021, that remains a fact. However, while the overall
crime remains the same, who is responsible for it and the method by which the crimes are
carried out have been modified.
While the financial services sector has undoubtedly increased security procedures and
adopted advanced technologies to deter attacks, underground actors continue to adapt and
develop new methods of evading anti-fraud systems to gain access to sensitive information
that financial businesses and organizations collect, store and transmit. With the world having
to adjust to the global pandemic in 2020, financial services are now exposed to new risks and
threats that attackers are taking advantage of. In the past six months, Intel 471 has observed
actors on the cybercriminal underground establish their reputation using a variety of goods,
products and services that have specifically targeted financial services.

One door closes, two doors open
There have been significant actions taken to undercut cybercrime this year, with each event
weakening criminals’ ability to target financial services. One was Joker's Stash, the prolific
carding dump shop, which announced its closure in January 2021. That announcement came
after law enforcement allegedly seized proxy servers used in connection with the site’s
blockchain-based domains. Another law enforcement action in 2021 successfully disrupted
the Emotet botnet, which featured a modular loader that could steal credentials and bank
details from infected users, as well as distribute other malware.
While each of these takedowns kneecaps criminal activity, there are actors on the
underground who move to fill in the void left by the law enforcement actions. With each of
the above examples, Intel 471 has seen other actors quickly move to establish a bigger
presence in the market.
With regards to Joker’s Stash, we have observed the creation of and updates to numerous
payment card data shops. An updated shop Intel 471 has been tracking offered payment card
information, particularly card verification values (CVVs) and dumps that included the data
copied from payment card magnetic stripes. As of mid-December 2020, the shop allegedly
contained 1,200 compromised payment card records and about 21,000 dumps for sale.
With regards to malware-as-a-service, Intel 471 has seen two actors sell access to malware
that targets the Android operating system in an effort to pull bank credentials. One service,
first advertised in October 2020, includes the ability to intercept, send and receive text
1/3

messages; grab payment card data and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes; and steal
online banking payment details through web-injects. Another actor, a relative newcomer to
the cybercriminal underground, started advertising an Android-focused MaaS that could
intercept, send and receive text messages; record an infected device’s screen; grab payment
card data; and steal online banking credentials through web-injects. The service allegedly
also supported a socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS5) proxy and keylogging modules.

Access is everything
Without obtaining credentials, a cybercriminal’s attempt to steal money or sensitive
information is exceedingly difficult. Credentials are a crucial cog for actors, serving as the
tool that paves the path to ill-gotten gains. Financial institutions are already a heavily
targeted sector, so this threat has the capability to impact those at both an individual and
organizational level.
Intel 471 has observed a number of actors advertise possession of personal bank account
login credentials, an organization's employee credentials, as well as system access credentials
over the past few months. In the closing months of 2020, we observed one actor offering
bank logins with credit card information from a Spanish financial institution, while also
claiming to have bank logins available from a French bank and an online bank popular in
Europe. Additionally, another actor being tracked by Intel 471 offered to sell compromised
account credentials to the control panel of business process management software used by an
undisclosed insurance company.
On the network access side, one actor Intel 471 is tracking tried to sell unauthorized access to
an undisclosed bank in Africa, claiming to have administrator-level access to the
organization’s domain controller, access credentials to some databases, the source code of
undisclosed applications the organization used, and the bank’s customer data. As recently as
January 2021, another actor monitored by Intel 471 offered to sell unauthorized access to the
network of a France-based company that deals in hardware and software for PoS systems,
including automatic coin mechanisms, cash registers, management systems and payment
software. The compromised account allegedly included domain administrator privileges and
enabled access to the company’s product source codes, GitHub software development
platform accounts, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts, employee email accounts and lists
of customer email addresses.
While an organization can help individuals recover from compromised payment cards or
bank logins, bouncing back from network compromise is much more difficult and therefore
presents a much larger threat.

Criminals make money machine go BRRR

2/3

When not going after the users or company itself, cybercriminals have turned their attention
to the next best thing: the machines that hold the money. The act of using malware to force
ATMs to malfunction and empty their cash — known as “jackpotting” — has been around for
some time, but actors are finding novel ways to get around baked-in defenses. Intel 471
observed one actor selling ATM malware that allegedly could be deployed using a speciallycrafted Raspberry Pi kit computer and be controlled remotely via a smartphone or a laptop.
ATMs aren’t the only hardware in criminals’ sights. Point-of-sale (PoS) malware also is being
sold on underground markets, taking advantage of flaws in the devices used to process card
payments at retail locations to steal sensitive information. Intel 471 observed an actor in
February 2021 selling PoS malware dubbed “ATM & POS Malware Injector” that allegedly
operated as a data sniffer without requiring additional action from the user. The malware
features included payment transaction data output in a result box that included Track 1 and
Track 2 data, as well as the personal identification number (PIN) code for the compromised
payment card. Data collected via this kind of malware has the capability to be used in further
fraudulent activity or offered for sale as a product on underground forums or via dump shop
services.
While the global economy took a hit over the last year as it recovers from the pandemic, the
underground marketplace continues to flourish with new opportunities as the potential
victim pool grows with the increase of people using online services. The buying, selling and
trading of products, goods and services used for crimes has fueled several attack schemes,
with many developed specifically to target the financial services sector. It’s apparent that
several threat actors leveraged multiple products, goods and services together to maximize
potential impact and profit. The target on financial services has remained a large one, with
new actors constantly developing ways to pry money away from its rightful owners.
