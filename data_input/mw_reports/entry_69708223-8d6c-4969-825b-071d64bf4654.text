Bitdefender Whitepaper
Iranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia

Overview

Key Findings:

Chafer APT is a threat group with an apparent Iranian
link. It is known to be active since 2014, focusing on
cyber espionage campaigns. Bitdefender has spotted
the group targeting critical infrastructure from the
Middle East, presumably for intelligence gathering.

•

Campaign targeted air transportation and
government

•

Attacker activity occurred on weekends

•

In the Kuwait attack, threat actors created their own
user account

Bitdefender researchers have found attacks conducted
by this actor in the Middle East region, dating back to
2018. The campaigns were based on several tools,
including “living off the land” tools, which makes
attribution difficult, as well as different hacking tools
and a custom built backdoor.

•

The Saudi Arabia attack relied on social engineering
to compromise victims

•

The end goal of both attacks was likely data
exploration and exfiltration

Victims of the analyzed campaigns fit into the pattern
preferred by this actor, such as air transport and
government sectors in the Middle East.

Attack Lifecycle
Reviewing telemetry regarding this threat, we have identified victims from two countries, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
The modus operandi in these counties shares some common stages, but the attacks seem more focused and
sophisticated on victims from Kuwait.
All the tools mentioned below will be detailed in the next section, Tools Arsenal.

Kuwait attack chain
The first signs of compromise were several reverse TCP files and PowerShell commands that executed some
base64 compressed code, specific to the Metasploit framework. Although difficult to speculate, it’s possible that the
threat actors used tainted documents with shellcodes to compromise the victim, potentially disseminated through
spearphishing emails.
Once the victims were compromised, attackers started to bring reconnaissance tools for network scanning (“xnet.
exe”, “shareo.exe”) and credential gathering (as “mnl.exe” or “mimi32.exe”) or tools with multiple functionalities, such
as CrackMapExec (for users’ enumeration, share listing, credentials harvesting and so on). This arsenal of tools helped
attackers move laterally inside the networks. Several methods were observed for this operation, either by using psexec
for remote service installation (also used by one of their custom tools “step-1.exe”), or through the use of RDP protocol,
a fact denoted by some unusual activity outside working hours and the presence of tools such as “rdpwinst.exe”.
Once they gained a foothold inside the company, they started to install custom modules: a modified Plink (wehsvc.exe)
installed as a service, as well as a backdoor (imjpuexa.exe), which was also executed as a service on some machines.
During our investigation, on some of the compromised stations we observed some unusual behavior performed under
a certain user account, leading us to believe the attackers managed to create a user account on the victims’ machine
and performed several malicious actions inside the network, using that account.

•

Some of the tools mentioned were found in an unusual place (on the Desktop), indicating that the account was not
compromised.

•

Most activity occurs on Friday and Saturday, coinciding with the weekend in Middle East.
o

•

Reviewing the incident timeline, we observed the following sequence: deployment of the modified
PuTTY tool (“wehsvc.exe”) on one of the machines; a specific user is created four days after, on the
same system; the user account is created on other systems from that network, during the following
days;

Beside the aforementioned tools, under this user account, we also saw the rdpwinst tool, which allows multiple rdp
sessions management, Smartftp Password Decryptor - the installer, and Navicat Premium, a database management
tool.

The attackers kept permanent communication with the victim, either through tools with proxy functionalities
(“mfevtpse.exe” and “mini.exe”) or through their own backdoor. As an interesting technique for C&C communication,
we observed that the C&C address is actually passed as a command line argument (both for some of the proxy tools
and for the backdoor itself).
Some traces indicate that the goal of the attack was data exploration and exfiltration (on some of the
victim’s tools such as Navicat, Winscp, found in an unusual location, namely “%WINDOWS%\ime\en-us-ime”, or
SmartFtpPasswordDecryptor were present on their systems). However, the lack of evidence, such as network logs,
makes it difficult to confirm this was indeed the attacker’s final objective.
A timeline of the attack for one of the organizations in Kuwait targeted by these threat actors is illustrated below.

Saudi Arabia attack chain
The case investigated in Saudi Arabia was not as elaborate, either because the attackers did not manage to further
exploit the victim, or because the reconnaissance revealed no information of interest.
We suspect the initial compromise was achieved through social engineering. The RAT component was located in the
%Download% folder, which is the default folder for any download process, while its parent process was actually explorer.
exe; indicating that the user executed the malicious file. Also, the RAT was executed twice, with different names
(“drivers.exe” and “drivers_x64.exe”). The two executions were three minutes apart, which raises suspicion that the
user was tricked into running them.
Internal network reconnaissance seems to have been performed using the “etblscanner.exe” tool. We also spotted the
use of three different RAT components which, according to the timeline, are not used at the same time. One of those
components, “snmp.exe”, is also present on some of the victims in Kuwait, under the name “imjpuexa.exe”, linking these
attacks to the same threat actors.
While this attack was not as extensive as the one in Kuwait, some forensic evidence suggests that the same attackers
might have orchestrated it. Despite the evidence for network discovery, we were not able to find any traces for lateral
movement, most probably because threat actors were not able to find any vulnerable machines.
A timeline of the attack is illustrated below.

Tools arsenal
Living off the land tools
This threat actor heavily uses “the Non-Sucking Service Manager” for ensuring that its critical components, such as
the proxy or the RAT, are up and running. They also use Sysinternals tools, such as psexec, for lateral movement in the
victim’s network. In terms of preinstalled Windows tools, we spotted the use of “schtasks.exe” for ensuring persistence,
“tasklist” for testing persistence, and “nslookup” for communication over DNS, making queries for TXT record.

Hacking tools
By analyzing reports from targeted victims, we also spotted hacking tools usually used in different stages of the kill
chain.
Mimikatz was used with different flavors, such as SafetyKatz, or customized, as depicted by previous security
researchers. The credentials obtained were used with the psexec tool to gain access to specific machines, a fact
denoted by some Python scripts converted to executables, which make the appropriate call to psexec with plain text
credentials.
Some infected systems also contain pieces of shellcode from the Metasploit framework, such as reverse_tcp, with the
purpose of connecting to different internal IP addresses.
Another tool, the CrackMapExec executable for version 2.2 (found on GitHub), has functionalities such as network
scanning and credential dumping, as well as accounts discovery or code injection.

Custom build tools
PLINK Tool
A slightly modified version of PLINK, part of the PuTTY suite, was also revealed by Bitdefender telemetry
in late September 2018. It preserves the original functionality, with some key new features such as the
possibility to run it as a Windows service or to uninstall the service. We believe this tool may have been used
either to communicate with the CnC or to gain access to some internals machines, but found no conclusive
evidence to support these scenarios. As filenames, we’ve seen only one name: “wehsvc.exe”.

Proxy Tools
Beside PLINK, we spotted a command line tool, written in C++, that implements a proxy. The architecture of this
application is straightforward, imposing the following flow:
•

it connects to the first available server from a given list

•

sends the following HTTP header “GET /CNT HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: bing.com\r\nUser-Agent:
Mozilla/5.0”, to indicate the beginning of the communication

•

waits for the server for a limited time, which will send a byte, representing a command and the associated
message.

The exposed commands are for setting or viewing the proxy id, echoing, session resetting, starting a tunnel or exiting.
Tunneling option (also denoted by debugging strings), which is the main functionality of this component,
implements socks5 protocol. When this command is selected, the proxy starts a new tcp connection with the current
server, sending the following http header “GET /TNL HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: bing.com\r\nUser-Agent:
Mozilla/5.0”. Then, it switches to the socks5 protocol on a new thread.

On some systems where we found this file, we noticed another proxy, different from the previous one. In terms of
implementation, it uses a custom protocol, which implies using a table of available connections and their ids. Those
ids are used in sending messages between hosts. Also, this one was packet by the UPX packer, version 3.03.The main
purpose of this tool is to give the attacker access to the internal network of the victim.
In our telemetry, those files were seen with the name of “mini.exe”, “mfevtpse.exe” or “mfevtps.exe”.

RAT Tools
During the attack, we also observed the use of a command line utility, which is a RAT, written in Python (probably
version 3.4) and converted into a standalone executable. Interestingly, the user interacts with this tool in a similar way
as with “mini.exe”, described in the Proxy Tools section. The same filename for default input, the common debugging
strings, even the help page for the two are very similar, which suggests a possible connection between the two.
This tool uses 2 types of communications (“DNS” and “HTTP”, as found in code), both over TCP, with the same
functionality. They both marshal the message such that the packet will resemble a DNS, and HTTP, packet. Parts of the
headers that are hardcoded can be seen below.

Part of header that will be included in the request (dns communication)

Part of header that will be included in the response (dns communication).
Headers for http communications are “GET /owa HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: live.com” for request and “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” for
response. Also, some parts of the code are specific to different operating systems, which means that this tool may be
in the wild in other forms.
Filenames for these tools found in our telemetry are “snmp.exe”, “imjpuexa.exe” and “driver_x86.exe”.
Our telemetry for the same machines revealed two other files that implement RAT functionalities, besides “snmp.
exe”and“imjpuexa.exe”.
One of them is very similar to MechaFlounder, as described by previous security research, but packing a few new
features. It implements a persistence mechanism (using a scheduled task, named “Defender Update”) and a custom
communication protocol over DNS (besides HTTP) with the CnC, where the response is found either in the IPv4 address
or in the TXT record.
The second file is also about persistence and features a similar mechanism for parsing commands as the previous
file. However, it uses the “Service Update” scheduled task name, instead of “Defender Update”. The key difference
between the two files is that the latter, in this case, communicates with the CnC through files uploaded to Dropbox,
where each victim has a separate folder named with the same combination of username and machine name as used
by MechaFlounder. The command, “service.html” is placed in the root of this directory, uploaded files from the victim

are placed into a folder named “/download”, and the files for download are placed into the “/upload” folder. Also, all
feedback messages are simplified and uploaded in the same directory, under the name “results.txt”. It also implements
a synchronization mechanism by using the folder “done”, placed in the root location for each victim.
Filenames for the two RATs are: “drivers.exe” (“drivers_x64.exe” for the 64-bit version) and “dbxservice.exe”. In terms
of persistence, both “drivers_x64.exe” and “dbxservice.exe” make a copy of themselves in the Temp folder, named
“MSCService.exe”, or “DBXService.exe” and then create a scheduled task that will reference them in that location.
Another interesting thing found in the decompiled code of the two files is the use of the special Unicode character
“202e” (Right-to-Left Override character), in the persistence section. This character is expected to be found as the first
command line argument.

Scanning tools
Bitdefender telemetry revealed another command line tool used in this attack, “xnet.exe”, which is very similar to the
known nbtscan tool, except it packs an additional feature. This version of the tool also obtains the IP range to scan
(when there is no given range) from network adapters on the machine. We also observed another tool, (“shareo.exe”)
written in C#, which obtains the NetBIOS name for each machine within a range of IPs.
Further investigation into our telemetry revealed a new tool (“etblscanner.exe”), implemented in Python and converted
to a Windows executable. As the name implies, it’s an EternalBblue scanner that accepts a given range of IPs.

Remexi tool
Found as “mas.dll” in our telemetry, it has been previously depicted as a backdoor. Interestingly, there is a connection
between this file and the “xnet.exe” tool described in the Scanning tools section above, as indicated by some very
similar yet uncommon pdb paths:
•

“F:\Projects\94-06\RCE\bin\Release\x64\mas.pdb” – in “mas.dll” tool

•

“F:\Projects\94-08\XNet\bin\Release\Win32\XNet.pdb”) – in “xnet.exe” tool

These two tools also share common functions in their code, some of them for debugging purposes. Both have the
same build number, 51106, for the compiler and the linker, which is found in the Rich header, and, in the PE header they
have the same Major.Minor version, namely 11.0. Thus, these metadata suggest an even stronger relationship between
them.
