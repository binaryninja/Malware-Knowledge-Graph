The Splunk Threat Research Team is monitoring several malicious payloads targeting Customer
Premise Equipment (CPE) devices. These are defined as devices that are at customer (Commercial,
Residential) premises and that provide connectivity and services to the internet backbone. Examples
include:
Cable Modems
1/6

Internet Gateways
Satellite Modems
Firewalls
Home routers, cable set-top boxes, DSL modems
VOIP telephones

The above devices are prevalent and fundamental for internet connectivity. Malicious actors can target
these devices to build very powerful botnets which in combination with tactical payloads, can potentially
exert a significant effect on critical internet infrastructure or even Operational Technologies devices.
CPE devices are generally not very powerful in terms of processing or functionality, however, when
hundreds of thousands of these devices are compromised and work in aggregation via Command and
Control they can cause significant damage. An example of this type of payload is VPNFilter discovered
by Cisco Talos and said to have compromised 500,000 devices worldwide.
Based on the current, ongoing geopolitical events and the recent takedown of a similar malicious
payload by the FBI named “Cyclops Blink” and attributed to Russian Federation’s Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU). The Splunk Threat Research Team has developed specific analytics to detect this
type of malicious code, including Cyclops Blink, and AcidRain.
The main malicious functions of these malicious payloads can be resumed in:
System discovery and footprinting
In some cases resists removal/reboot
Destroys infected equipment (Wipes flash memory, sd, memory card, and block devices)
Modification of routing traffic rules
Ability to download and install additional payloads
Obfuscated multiple C2 callback failover (TOR, VPS, Geolocation)

Another common thing about these payloads is that they target popular commercial CPE brands. This
speaks of the intention of targeting critical infrastructure to gain access, implant malicious payloads,
and hoard as many compromised devices as possible that can be used for subsequent attacks.
Due to the ability to download additional payloads, these additional payloads may likely be
implemented based on tactical objectives (DDoS, Destruction, Espionage, Lateral Movement, etc). It is
important to notice that many of these devices are not just commercial, industrial, or military but used in
civilian networks, which exposes the general population to these attacks and presents a direct threat to
civilian infrastructure and livelihood.
For specific make and model of affected devices please refer to the reference section at the end of this
advisory.
The following are the detections crafted for these payloads.

Mitigations
The above detections were crafted under a Linux environment and can be used as guidelines for other
architectures such as MISP or PowerPC. The key to implementing these types of detections is the
ability to monitor via a logging mechanism (i.e syslog).
Addressing the threat of these types of payloads can be very difficult as many of these devices do not
allow for the implementation of centralized logging which impairs monitoring and defense. Considering
that many enterprises have had remote work programs since the pandemic started, their perimeter
may likely have a device affected by these payloads, in which case the best course of action is to
disconnect, discard and replace them. Some other mitigation options are:
Discard affected hardware as payload resists removal, and rebooting.
Implement integrity validation mechanisms on CPEs software and hardware
Upgrade and harden CPE devices, discard them if the device has reached the end of life (EOL).
If a device cannot be monitored, the device must be discarded.
Consult with vendors, ISP on how to improve security on CPE devices
Enable logging of these devices to implement detections
Follow CISA Home Network Security Guide (ST15-002)
Follow CISA Securing Network Infrastructure Devices (ST18-001)

4/6

It is also important to consider that an advanced adversary as the aforementioned has likely devised
other ways of access, exploitation or persistence that may be yet unknown and that may target these
devices after remediation. This is why prevention, monitoring, and detection are fundamental to defend
against these threats.
