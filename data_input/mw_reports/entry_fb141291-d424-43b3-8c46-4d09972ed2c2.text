Some further TTPs used by TRICKBOT [1] from an infected host that I thought was
interesting to share. The sample used here is from an EMOTET to TRICKBOT infection

Continuing on some past research on TRICKBOT's arsenal of modules, I knew that there
was a PowerShell EMPIRE module NewBCtestDll64 but never saw it ITW (in-the-wild)
myself.

This soon escalated to COBALT-STRIKE connectivity and BLOODHOUND reconnaissance.

In this observed activity, EMPIRE was used for reconnaissance and privledge escalation and
COBALT-STRIKE for delivering further recon via the means of BLOODHOUND - both tools
attempted credential dumping with MIMIKATZ. The endgame here, is for the adversary to
priv esc all the way to Domain Admin for full domain compromise to then deliver one of the
many ransomware variants such as RYUK [2]
.

RECENT NOTES ON EMPIRE
For those that do not know, PowerShell EMPIRE is a post exploitation framework written in
PowerShell. This project has recently retired due to the heighten uptake in PowerShell
visibility over the last few years, the project has stated it has reached its goal and has ended
support.
PSA for Empire development: The original objective of the Empire project was to
demonstrate the post-exploitation capabilities of PowerShell and bring awareness to
PowerShell attacks used by (at the time) more advanced adversaries.

Although EMPIRE is now in retirement it is still being used ITW (in-the-wild). It still works, just
not supported. I'd expect an uptake on other C2 post exploitation frameworks many such are
listed here Remote Access Tools

THE RUNDOWN
A quick series of events will unfold. Some of these are documented here. From EMOTET
infection to CS connectity it was less then 48hrs.

Ransomware variant delivery. (?)
Game Over !
Highlighted was observed activity.

HELLO POWERSHELL EMPIRE
To start off we identify the newly established EMPIRE connectivity.
The initial "stager" is the way the victim talks back to the EMPIRE C2 that is listening
for the connection to then download stage 2 which is the EMPIRE agent. The default
launcher/stager is a PowerShell Base64 encoded/obsfucated command.
By capturing the PowerShell activity on our box (PowerShell Logging, Command Line audit
logging EID 4688), decoding and identifying the EMPIRE stager wasn't too difficult due to the
fact most if not all the EMPIRE defaults were left the same. CyberChef EMPIRE stager
reciped used is available here.

EMPIRE Stager

On decoding this Base64 blob of data, the key items to look for are the default settings for an
EMPIRE stager as documented in the official EMPIRE Github repo. These defaults are;

3/12

User-agent:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Session Cookie field:
"Cookie", "session=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

On of the following URLs:
/login/process.php
/admin/get.php
/admin/news.php

You can see the decoded result and highlighted fields

We can see that the values were left as defaults as per Github EMPIRE Repo. For reference,
the default user agent string and URLs for EMPIRE.

4/12

STEP IN POWERSPLOIT
Once the EMPIRE connection is established we see plenty of follow up POWERSPLOIT
activity.
PowerSploit is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that can be used to aid
penetration testers during all phases of an assessment. PowerSploit is comprised of
the following modules: CodeExecution, ScriptModification, Persistence,
AntivirusBypass, Exfiltration, Mayhem, Privesc, Recon.
Simply put, the threat actor starts profiling or gathering a siutational awareness of their new
environment they have landed in.
Get-NetComputer

| Out-String | %{$_ + "`n"};"`nGet-NetComputer completed!"

Get-NetComputer -OperatingSystem *server* | Out-String | %{$_ + "`n"};"`nGetNetComputer completed!"
Get-NetDomainTrust

| Out-String | %{$_ + "`n"};"`nGet-NetDomainTrust completed!"

Get-NetDomainController
completed!"

| Out-String | %{$_ + "`n"};"`nGet-NetDomainController

Invoke-MapDomainTrust | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation | Out-String | %{$_ +
"`n"};"`nInvoke-MapDomainTrust completed!"

From the manual - descriptions of each.
Get-NetComputer - gets a list of all current servers in the domain
Get-NetDomainTrust - gets all trusts for the current user's domain
Get-NetForestTrust - gets all trusts for the forest associated with the current user's
domain
Invoke-MapDomainTrust - try to build a relational mapping of all domain trusts
Get-NetDomainController - gets the domain controllers for the current computer's
domain

5/12

Shortly after followed by an attempted credential dump using POWERSPLOIT's InvokeMimikatz -DumpCreds which actually failed in this environment.
"VirtualAlloc failed to allocate memory for PE. If PE is not ASLR compatible, try running
the script in a new PowerShell process (the new PowerShell process will have a
different memory layout, so the address the PE wants might be free)."
MIMIKATZ within EMPIRE v2.1.1 20171106 / POWERSPLOIT v2.0 alpha seems problematic
with the newer updates of Windows 10. MIMIKATZ at the time of writing is at version v2.2.020190813. These frameworks are using an outdated version. (Cheers DP - REDTEAM

STEP IN COBALTSTRIKE AND BLOODHOUND

🐶

A quick background for those not in the know.
Cobalt Strike is software for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations...Cobalt
Strike gives you a post-exploitation agent and covert channels to emulate a quiet longterm embedded actor in your customer's network.
https://www.cobaltstrike.com/
BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships
within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily
identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly
identify
https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound
I was originally suprised about the use of Invoke-BloodHound at first which is from the
default BLOODHOUND ingester SharpHound - ingester = data gatherer. SharpHound.ps1 Runs the BloodHound C# Ingestor using reflection. With this little Bloodhound 101 first up
was the CS stager and connectivity.

🙀

The following code kicks off a COBALT-STRIKE 'beacon stager'. This hosted stager, uses
@MrUn1k0d3r's "DONT KILL MY CAT" (DKMC)
which obfuscates the shellcode to avoid
detection when executed on the endpoint. This DKMC 'template' gives away the use of
COBALT-STRIKE.

Base64 and Gunzip decompress, decodes to a DKMC PowerShell stager with encoded and
XOR encrypted shellcode.

Another Base64 decode and XOR decrypt using the hardcoded key 35. CyberChef doing the
heavy work here.

7/12

Which leaves us with a nice COBALT-STRIKE C2 and USER AGENT string.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts
185.147.14[.]242

Once an active connection was made to the infected victim, a follow up series of recon
commands were carried out via Get-NetLoggedon , Get-NetComputer | Out-String |
%{$_ + "`n"};"`nGet-NetComputer completed!" and another attempt to dump
credentials was made with Invoke-Mimikatz . Lastly we see the domain recon via
BLOODHOUND
Set-Alias Get-BloodHoundData Invoke-BloodHound
Invoke-BloodHound -Threads 20 -CollectionMethod Default -Throttle 1000 -CSVFolder
$(Get-Location) | Out-String | %{$_ + "`n"};"`nInvoke-BloodHound completed!"
Writing output to CSVs in: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\netcloud\
Done writing output to CSVs in: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\netcloud\

This actually left artefacts on disk
local_admins.csv , group_memberships.csv ,
trusts.csv and user_sessions.csv .
Shortly after this activity ended (maybe they realised my AD topology wasn't too hot and the
penny eventually dropped... ) connections were then severed.

OTHER TRICKBOT OBSERVATIONS - ESENTUTL? .EDBs?
One other thing I noted with this TRICKBOT infection was the use of ESENT UTIL to gather
IE and Explorer browser history and webcache. The below command was seen;
esentutl /p /o C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp\grabber_temp.edb

"a centralized meta-data store for the browser using the proven "JET Blue" Extensible
Storage Engine (ESE) database format"
"Remember that even if a user never opens Internet Explorer, there may still be
valuable records in their IE database including files opened on the local system,
network shares, and removable devices"
https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2015/06/03/ese-databases-are-dirty/
"browser history data and while Chrome and Firefox allow copying of the history files,
the WebCacheV01.dat file that IE and Edge history are stored in is a locked file and
cannot be copied using native copy"
https://dfironthemountain.wordpress.com/tag/ese-database/
Artefacts on disk will be in the form of a .RAW capture
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\grabber_temp.INTEG.RAW

Snippet from the .RAW log file below. Seems to be validating/repairing the database before
exfiltrating?

You can download, NIRSOFT ESE Viewer to peak inside the .edb file to see what data has
been staged. In summary, the threat actors are looking for files and locations of interest on
the network (?). Maybe profiling if you are a user? or to provide them context and situational
awareness of the environment they have spawned into and where to pivot next such as file
servers (?). ESENTUTL and EDB files are one to be aware of and possibly a contender for
DFIR professionals and
teams to use also!

Found another #powershellempire C2, used in the same #RYUK attack:

Also I have said it before but will say it again @GCHQ love your CyberChef tool, so
easy to use (https://t.co/dlvsxhZzXd) thanks! pic.twitter.com/EwRW1oPGYy

Another similar TRICKBOT post-exploitation but using PSEXEC and AdFind to help deploy
RYUK ransomware to the environment. A Nasty Trick: From Credential Theft Malware to
Business Disruption

😂

Again, different attack paths, key sightings on TRICKBOT using EMPIRE/POSHC2 to deliver
the "cyber-aids"
Usually it's FAKEUPDATES -> DRIDEX | TRICKBOT -> EMPIRE -> CYBERAIDS, but
what I just saw was FAKEUPDATES -> DRIDEX -> POSHC2. We stopped it obviously
before the CYBERAIDS. Highly recommend not catching the CYBERAIDS.

WRAP UP

10/12

The combination of EMOTET's access-as-a-service model and TRICKBOT's offensive set of
modular tooling, they pose a real and current threat to businesses large and small. As stated
before, once the infected systems have reported back - the threat actors can be pivoting
further in your environment within (in this instance) <48hrs and start to elevate privledges to
own the domain to ultimately deliver further badness such as ransomware. Using off the shelf
offensive tooling such as EMPIRE, COBALTSTRIKE, BLOODHOUND, POWERSPLOIT and
the infamous MIMIKATZ, detecting these tools are key in stopping the likes of TRICKBOT
from moving further. Also to note, is the time taken to detect, investigate and remediate.
Doing this in a timely manner is highly recommended. With the likes of offensive PowerShell
becoming easiler to detect its only a matter of time before these TTPs change once more.

RECOMMENDATIONS
To avoid the "cyber-aids". I recommend;
As always defense in depth.
Powershell visibility is still key for detection. (+transcription logging) - ship these off the
host ASAP.
CommandLine Logging - EventID 4688, Sysinternal SYSMON, EDR products.
Active Directory auditing and logging to capture BLOODHOUND recon on AD objects.
This could be incredible noisey depending on the environment but check out "honey
tokens" for fake accounts that should never be queried.
Detect over the wire Bloodhound via IDS/NSM - large LDAP queries from unexpected
hosts like clients. Know whats normal first.
Further segregation of your network where possible to hinder lateral movement.
Puple teaming excercises
. Pre-running BLOODHOUND and proactively going
after the same fuit of the attackers. Harden and repeat. #PurpleTeaming
Detect TRICKBOT recon ipconfig /all , net config workstation , net view
/all /domain , nltest /domain_trusts , nltest /domain_trusts within a short
time frame/chained together).
