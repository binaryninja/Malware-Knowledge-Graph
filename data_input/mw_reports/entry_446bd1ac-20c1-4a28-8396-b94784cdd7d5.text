Since Stampado was discovered being sold on the darkweb for the cheap price of $39 USD,
no samples were available. That changed today when I discovered two samples of
Stampado on VirusTotal. It is currently unknown if these samples are from a live distribution
campaign or were submitted by the distributor/developer to test how well they are detected
by security programs. The best part is that it really doesn't matter as from these samples a
decryptor has already been made by Fabian Wosar.

What we do know, though, is that Stampado is fully functional and written in the AutoIT
scripting language. When installed, it will encrypt a victim's files using AES encryption and
then demand a ransom in order to get your files back. The two samples I have discovered
have the names kek.exe and WifiHack.exe. At this time the ransom amount is currently
unknown and you need to email the specified email address in order to get payment
instructions.

How to Decrypt files encrypted by Stampado
Fabian Wosar, of Emsisoft, was able to analyze the Stampado samples and create a decryptor
for the infection. To use Fabian's decryptor, simply download it from the following
URL: https://decrypter.emsisoft.com/stampado. Once downloaded, execute it and go into
the options screen, where you will need to enter your ID and the email address found on the
lock screen.

Decryptor Options

Once you enter in the required information, you can go back to the Decryptor tab and begin
decrypting your files.

Decrypting Files

When the decryptor finished decrypting the files, you can close the program.

Possible link between Stampado and Jigsaw?
There are some interesting correlations, though possibly weak, between the Jigsaw
ransomware and Stampado.
One of the nastier "features" of Stampado is its Russian Roulette, which will randomly delete
an encrypted file every 6 hours. Each time this roulette countdown reaches 0, the amount of
files are doubled. This is the same incrementing file deletion behavior is also exhibited by
Jigsaw during its countdown. As file deletion in ransomware is very rare, it is interesting to
see a similar behavior between the two ransomware infections.
Coincidentally, Michael Gillespie found a variant of Jigsaw yesterday that included the email
address stampado@narod.ru. Coincidence or not?

Last, but not least, Stampado is being sold on the same darkweb site as Jigsaw. Granted,
these connections are weak at best, yet I felt it was worth mentioning.

How Stampado encrypts a victim's Files
When Stampado is installed it will copy itself to %AppData%\scvhost.exe and encrypt
specific file types found under the victim's %UserProfile% folder using AES encryption.
When it encrypts a file, it will append the .locked extension to it. This means that a file
called test.jpg, will be named test.jpg.locked. The files currently targeted by Stampado are:

.odp, .ods, .odt

During the encryption process, Stampado will also create two files in the %AppData%
folder that have 32 character hexadecimal names. One file will be used to store a list of the
encrypted files and the other file will contain status information used by the ransomware.
When the encryption is finished, Stampado will display a lock screen that contains a unique
ID that is associated with the victim and an email address that is needed to get payment
information. The current emails used by the ransomware are ransom64@sigaint.com
and paytodecrypt@sigaint.org. Victim's are told to email the associated email address for
payment instructions and once payment is made, they will receive a key to enter into the lock
screen to decrypt the files.

Stampado Lock Screen

On the lock screen there will also be a timer called Next Russian Roulette file deletion
and Time until total loss. When the Russian Roulette countdown reaches 0, a randomly
selected encrypted file will be deleted. Each time the Russian Roulette countdown reaches 0,
the amount of encrypted files deleted will be doubled. When the Time until total loss timer
reaches zero, all of the encrypted data on the computer will be deleted.
As already stated, there is no need to pay a ransom to Stampado as a decryptor has already
been made.

The behavior of the ransomware author is odd. I think he's keeping an eye on the
security community and might patch the program soon.

It's possible, but kits don't typically receive the same attention as a private/restricted
sale ransomware.

Out of curiosity, is the flaw that allows decryption similar at all to the flaw in Jigsaw?
I'm assuming not due to the requirement of the ID by this decryptor but am still curious
:)

Lawrence Abrams - 5 years ago

Jigsaw uses AES as well, but this is a different method used to decrypt it.

May I ask where you got that info?

Hi,
I am trying to decrypt the files from the Stampado ransomware, but i do not have the
email and ID from the ransomware pop up page. Please, can somebody help me out?

Is the screen not showing? Unfortunately, no way to decrypt without that info.

Why you delete my message?

You posted the same comment in multiple accounts. I left it in the previous location. If
oyu want to post it here, I can remove it from the other article.
