Blackhole Ramnit - samples and analysis
contagiodump.blogspot.com/2012/01/blackhole-ramnit-samples-and-analysis.html

Ramnit - a Zeus-like trojan/worm/file infector with rootkit capabilities has been in the wild for
a long time but recently made news because Seculert reported about a financial variant of
this malware aimed at stealing Facebook credentials.
While I did not see any Facebook related activity in my samples, I am posting them anyway
for your research as their functionality is the same.
The samples I have are being spread not via Facebook but via Blackhole exploit kit, which is
a very effective method. Blackhole exploit kit was associated with the spread of ZeuS,
Spyeye, and it is not surprising that Ramnit is being spread in the same manner by the same
groups. The group of command and control servers that I researched is associated with
pharma spam and "Canadian" online pharmacies.

Download
Download all the binaries and dropped files as a password protected archive (email me
if you need the password)

Distribution
The files analysed were / are being distributed via Blackhole exploit pack. It starts with the
usual large letter message "Please wait page is loading" -then Java exploit launches and
compromise takes place if the machine is vulnerable. . Here you can see the Blackhole
domains spreading Ramnit in the Malwaredomainlist . Amberfreda.com domain belongs to
a legitimate company and is registered in Arizona, while a subdomain best.amberfreda.com
is registered by some Ukranian guy. Not sure how they managed that.

Brief Analysis
607B2219FBCFBFE8E6AC9D7F3FB8D50E
Hendrik Adrian from Japan posted his analysis of the same sample ( 0day.JP - Ramnit)
where he described the files created by the malware and the spam sending capabilities of
the bot .

The bot deletes registry settings for the safe

boot, which causes BSOD and prevents one from removing the malicious files in the safe
3/12

mode.

2. Adds a Windows service
Micorsoft Windows Service - note the spelling

3. Adds the following files (names vary)

Ramnit injects itself into two svchost.exe processes and you can see them if you sort all
processes by PID, the last two will those created by Ramnit.
It generates spam that it sends out on port 25, Hendrik already described this behavior in his
post.
C33E7ED929760020820E8808289C240E
The second file has file infector features I did not observe in
607B2219FBCFBFE8E6AC9D7F3FB8D50E.
As you see in the log below, malicious svchost.exe modifies or tries to modify every binary
and HTML file by appending malicious code to each file or a vbs script to HTML files - like
described in this post by ESET Win32/Ramnit.A. and here in the post by Avira - Closer look
at W32/Ramnit.C
This does not break the infected binaries, all files continue to work as designed, except they
infect or reinfect the computer they are running on. Webmasters may upload infected html
files and visitors of their sites may get infected as well. For an average user, it is impossible
to clean a system compromised with Ramnit file injector and use it confidence. The only way
is say good bye to all the HTM(L), DLL and EXE files and build a new system without trying
to copy any hrml files, bookmark or applications.

Thsi is what happens with VirustotalUpload2.exe (and most other Programs including Adobe,
MS Office and Windows files)

Traffic
607B2219FBCFBFE8E6AC9D7F3FB8D50E - C&C is
sinkholedC33E7ED929760020820E8808289C240E - C&C is active

6/12

Despite the fact that the C&C for 607B2219FBCFBFE8E6AC9D7F3FB8D50E is sinkholed, it
is still interesting to see the malware behavior when it tries to establish a connection with the
server.
Ramnit samples used by the same group of attackers have overlapping set of C&C servers the list is not the same but I found that my samples that are supposedly later version that
Ramnit.AK have approximately 80% overlap in C&C list used by this RamnitAK binary
described by Sophos . I have combined the two lists and ran WHOIS queries to establish
active C&C and their location and registration.
The communications with the sinkholed server below show that once the bot receives SYN
command from the C&C, it sends 6 bytes of data. Exact same behavior is described in this
analysis of the binaries from Summer 2011 - with the only difference that the second packet
sent by the bot was not 75 bytes but 149 bytes Bot of the Day: Ramnit/NinmulMonday, July
18th, 2011. If connection with the server is established, the traffic continues on on port 443, it
is encoded but it is not SSL, it is some sort of custom protocol.

The bot is going through the list of domains trying to find those that are active. Most of the
domains are not registered yet but the two currently active domains were registered on
January 5 and 6, 2011. It appears that the attackers register new domains as soon as the
lose any due to sinkholing and domain cancellations. Since all the domains have the most
random names, they are not likely to be registered by someone else before they are needed.
Having each binary to check a long list of domains makes the bot very noisy (consider
making IDS signatures based on UDP port 53 thresholds) but it prevents the death of the
botnet in case of the C&C loss. I have complied a list of approximately 400 domains with only
21 of them registered. If you created DNS blocks or sinkhole domains, consider blocking or
sinkholing all of them, not only active.

Registered domains. See the text version below. The yellow/red entries show active C&C. All
others are sinkholed or NXD'd.
