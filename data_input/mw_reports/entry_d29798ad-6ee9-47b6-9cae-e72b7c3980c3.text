Introduction
I've frequently seen malicious spam pushing Lokibot (also spelled "Loki-Bot") since 2017.
This year, I've written diaries about it in February 2018 and June 2018. I most recently
posted an example to my blog on 2018-11-26. This type of malicious spam shows no signs
of stopping, so here's a quick diary covering an example from Monday 2018-12-03.
The email
Templates for malicious spam pushing Lokibot vary, and the example from Monday 2018-1203 was disguised as a purchase quotation. The email contained an Excel spreadsheet with
a macro designed to infect vulnerable Windows hosts with Lokibot malware. Potential
victims need to click through warnings, so this is not an especially stealthy method of
infection.

Infection traffic
A macro from the Excel spreadsheet retrieved Lokibot malware using HTTPS from a URL at
a.doko[.]moe. I used Fiddler to monitor the HTTPS traffic and determine the URL. The
HTTPS request to a.doko[.]moe had no User-Agent string. If you use curl to retrieve the
binary, you must use the -H option to exclude the User-Agent line from your HTTPS request.

Forensics on the infected host
3/6

The infected Windows host made Lokibot persistent through a Windows registry update.
This registry update was quite similar to previous Lokibot infections I've generated in my lab
environment. In this example, the infected host also had a VBS file in the Windows menu
Startup folder. This pointed to another copy of the Lokibot malware executable; however,
that executable had deleted itself during the infection. The only existing Lokibot executable
was in the directory path listed in the associated Windows registry entry.

Shown above: Windows registry update to keep Lokibot persistent.

had deleted itself.
Indicators
The following are indicators from an infected Windows host. Any URLs, IP addresses, and
domain names have been "de-fanged" to avoid any issues when viewing today's diary.
Traffic from an infected windows host:
185.83.215[.]3 port 443 - a.doko[.]moe - GET /tkencn.jpg (encrypted HTTPS traffic)
199.192.27[.]109 port 80 - decvit[.]ga - POST /and/cat.php
Malware from an infected windows host:
