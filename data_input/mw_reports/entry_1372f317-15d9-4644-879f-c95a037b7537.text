Conti and Hive ransomware operations:
Leveraging victim chats for insights

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Through open-source research, we obtained and analyzed over four months of chat
logs — more than 40 separate conversations — between Conti and Hive ransomware
operators and their victims. The findings in this paper give an overview of the actors’
communications styles, persuasion techniques, ransom negotiations, operational and
targeting information, and more.

•

Conti and Hive have markedly different communication styles, with Conti employing
a range of persuasion tactics in what often seem like scripted and somewhat organized
exchanges. Hive communications, by contrast, are much shorter, more direct, and void
of many of the persuasion techniques that Conti employs. These differences possibly
reflect varying levels of organizational oversight for affiliates or may simply exemplify the
unique communication styles employed by various ransomware actors.

•

Both groups are very quick to lower ransom demands, routinely offering substantial
reductions multiple times throughout their negotiations. It is clear that the actors’ initial
ransom demand is rarely their bottom line.

•

Conti and Hive do research on victim organizations before determining the ransom
amount, with both groups typically asking for about one percent of the company’s
annual revenue. Both threat actors appear to target entities indiscriminately, likely based
on what they assess to be the easiest victims to compromise for quick financial gains.

•

Hive operators displayed surprisingly poor operational security, revealing sensitive
information about their encryption process and other operational details. Other
evidence suggests that Hive affiliates do not adhere to any sort of standard operating
procedure and employ any and all means necessary to convince their victims to pay,
including offering kickbacks to victim negotiators once the ransom payment is made.

INTRODUCTION
The ransomware space is dynamic, continually marked by new emerging ransomware variants, groups rebranding under
different names or shutting down operations altogether, and new strategic partnerships between different cybercrime gangs.
The focused crackdown on ransomware operations by U.S. authorities and international partners has introduced even more
change into this threat space, pushing ransomware actors into the focus of law enforcement’s targeted efforts to disrupt their
operations. Current events on the international stage have also recently affected at least one major ransomware player, the

notorious ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group known
as Conti. After Conti publicly supported Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, a cybersecurity researcher took revenge against the
ransomware gang by leaking information about the group,
including the malware’s source code and internal chats
between affiliates.
The theme of constant change is also at play as it relates to
the Hive ransomware group, as we have recently seen the
threat actors update the malware after security researchers
published methods for decrypting infected data. The Korea
Internet and Security Agency (KISA) subsequently released
a decryption utility, presumably based on this research. Hive
developers updated their malware after the research was
published, and it appears KISA’s tool only works against
earlier versions of Hive ransomware, not updated versions.
Conti and Hive are currently positioned as two of the
biggest players in the ransomware scene. With Conti, while
their leaks exposed interesting information from internal
messages between Conti operators, such as various job
roles within the organization and their process for hiring new
affiliates, the chat conversations covered in this report are
from entirely different sources and focus on communications
between the threat actors and victims. By analyzing their
chats with compromised organizations, we gained insight
into how the actors determine ransom amounts, their
willingness to negotiate lower prices, sales tactics and
coercive means to compel victims to pay, and many other
details about their operations.
Similarly, the Hive chats that we analyzed for this report
between the actors and victims come as the group
continues to make headlines for high-profile breaches and
the security community seeks to better understand and
protect against such attacks. The Hive chats we reviewed
provided an interesting contrast to Conti, allowing us to
compare various operational and communications methods
between the two groups. The conversations also exposed
important information about the Hive ransomware payload
and encryption methods, highlighting at least one affiliate’s
poor operational security in their willingness to disclose
such sensitive information. While Cisco Talos Incident
Response (CTIR) engagements have included remediation
of ransomware infections of all types, these chats were
obtained strictly via open-source investigatory means, and
not through CTIR engagements.

This report builds on Talos’ growing body of work that
highlights the human interest component of high-profile
adversaries, research that brings to light important
information of intelligence value, like threat actor motivations,
communications methods, operational insights, and more.
A similar research endeavor from last year, for example,
resulted in our paper based on chats with a self-proclaimed
Lockbit ransomware operator from which we gleaned
valuable, first-hand details of the operator’s cybercriminal
activities. Likewise, this report, which is based on an analysis
of more than 40 chats over a four-month period, highlights
several important takeaways for executives and the broader
cybersecurity community at a time when ransomware
attacks remain a major threat to organizations globally.

CONTI
COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES
Based on the chat logs we reviewed between Conti
operators and victims, we observed several interesting
themes and techniques the actors use to accomplish their
ultimate goal of extorting organizations for large amounts of
money. Conti’s communication style is relatively professional,
marked by seemingly scripted introductions and a matterof-fact tone that is mostly void of emotion and hyperbole.
The actors stay on message, explaining to the victim they’re
infected and pointing out what consequences the victim
is likely to face if they fail to pay the ransom, and trying to
convince the victim to pay as quickly as possible.
The actors’ initial chats with compromised organizations
are direct and to the point. The actors typically introduce
themselves — “We are the Conti Team” — and often ask
for the person communicating on the other end to identify
themselves with their name, company name and position.
They proceed to explain that Conti has compromised the
victim’s network, exfiltrated all sensitive information and
encrypted the victim’s files.
From there, we observed the threat actors employing a
variety of different persuasion techniques. In many instances,
the adversaries attempt to empathize with victims, equating
themselves to business people just like the compromised
entity and claiming that they want to help restore the victim’s
data. They appear to make the ransom payment seem like
it is in exchange for their help, in one instance proclaiming,
“Fortunately, Conti is here to prevent any further damage!”

The actors say they will provide “IT support” by offering a “decryption
tool,” even offering to give the victim a full security report upon payment
to ensure that such an attack does not happen again in the future. We
obtained one such security report, which is illustrated in Figure 1.

interactions with numerous victims.

email compromise. So, first of all —

The actors further mask these extortion attempts by saying they provide
“damage prevention services,” again purporting to be helpful assistants
who can help protect the victim. In many instances, Conti operators
remind victims about the consequences of having data leaked, including
such information being sold on the dark web to cybercriminals who will
leverage the data in their own operations, including social engineering
attacks. The victim’s customers, vendors, employees and investors will all
be notified about the breach, Conti warns, but the threat actors claim they
can resolve these problems immediately upon payment.

Basic recommendations
regarding network:

Conti also employed other marketing techniques to convince victims to
pay, including offering Christmas and holiday discounts and other price
reductions intended to make the victim feel like they are getting a good
deal. Many of these deals are incentivized by quick payments, with a
Conti actor offering in one instance that the victim can receive a “special
discount” if “we make a deal in the next 72 hours.”

4.

The tactics outlined so far are Conti’s attempts to be more empathetic
and make the victim feel like Conti is helping them or cutting them a deal.
However, we also observed Conti employ more aggressive techniques,
including fear and coercion. The threat actors remind victims of the
reputational damage and legal troubles that will result from a data leak,
citing media reports about other companies who have faced multi-million
and billion-dollar lawsuits for data breaches. They use scare tactics by
telling the victim that the company’s stock value will nosedive if Conti leaks
their data and threaten to provide competitors with the stolen information.
The actors remind the victim of the various governmental bodies and
regulatory acts that punish organizations for data leaks and revisit the
notion of employees becoming identity theft victims if the data is sold on
the Dark Web. These threats seemed to intensify as Conti’s frustration with
the victim’s slow responses or perceived lack of urgency grew.
These more aggressive tactics are consistent with recent trends reported
by the U.S. government. According to CISA’s 2021 global ransomware
trends report, ransomware actors are diversifying their approach to
extorting money, including informing the victim’s partners, shareholders,
or suppliers about the incident.
RANSOM NEGOTIATIONS

"The chances that Hell will freeze are higher than us misleading
our customers. We are the most elite group in this market, and our
reputation is the absolute foundation of our business and we will
never breach our contract obligations." - Conti operator to victim
annual revenue, with the actors stating as much in several
of the communications we reviewed.
Conti actors are very willing to negotiate and almost
always offered or approved a lower ransom amount in the
conversations we reviewed. These reductions were initiated
by either Conti or the victim depending on the situation, but
in instances where the victim requested a lower ransom
payment, the threat actors almost always obliged quickly and
with little or no hesitation. In some instances, a lower ransom
payment would still cost the victim data exposure: In one
case, a Conti operator agreed to lower the amount by nearly
80 percent, but with the stipulation that 80 percent of the
victim’s data would be published to their leak site.
The price reductions that Conti offered were generally
substantial, including 10, 24, 57and 74 percent, and even
higher. In one exchange, Conti dropped the ransom demand
five times, with the amount dropping a net 98 percent from
$50 million to $1 million. Despite Conti’s willingness to
negotiate, they had limits to how low they would drop the
ransom amount and would eventually hold firm on a final
figure. In one case, the lowest figure they were willing to
accept was $100,000, although we did not have insight into
the initial ransom offer or that company’s annual revenue.
These findings highlight the actors’ willingness to negotiate
and also indicate that Conti’s initial ransom demand is more
of a starting point for negotiations rather than a final offer.
Conti also appears similarly flexible on their payment dates,
with deadlines frequently being pushed out at victims’
requests. These behaviors suggest Conti operators are
highly opportunistic cybercriminals who ultimately would
prefer some payment as opposed to none, even if that
means capitulating to repeated requests by the victim.

REPUTATION MATTERS
Like most legitimate business operations, cybercriminals
depend on maintaining a “good” reputation, at least as
it relates to following through on agreements with victim
organizations. This is also top of mind for Conti, as the threat
actors repeatedly reiterated their strong intent to uphold their
end of the deal, even appearing angry at times when they
perceived victims were questioning their trustworthiness.
In one exchange, a Conti operator exclaimed, “THERE IS
NO WAY that we will not fulfill our promises after you pay.”
In another conversation, a Conti actor noted the group’s
“vast experience” in this field, even encouraging the victim
to Google the group to find evidence that they never “bluff.”
Conti further echoed these sentiments in the following
remarks: “The chances that Hell will freeze are higher than
us misleading our customers. We are the most elite
group in this market, and our reputation is the absolute
foundation of our business and we will never breach our
contract obligations.”
This level of confidence and bravado is likely an important
component of Conti’s ability to establish some level of
trust — albeit under unique circumstances — with their
“customers.” The only assurance a victim organization has
in believing that their stolen data won’t be leaked is the
threat actor’s word and, by extension, the group’s broader
reputation. If Conti hopes to maximize payments, they have
to employ a combination of coercive and persuasive tactics
with firm assurances that they will uphold their end of the
deal. This likely explains Conti’s firm, sometimes emotional
language we observed in these types of interactions.
OPERATIONAL INSIGHTS AND TTPS
These conversations also yielded insight into some of Conti’s
operational details and tactics, techniques and procedures

(TTPs). Conti uses ProtonMail, an encrypted email service,
to communicate with victims. They also use various
temporary mail and file storage sites, as revealed in their
conversations with victims, including SendSpace, qaz[.]im
and PrivatLab. The file hosting sites are especially useful, as
Conti leverages them to share files with victims. In one case,
the Conti operator directed the victim to download a deletion
log from a PrivatLab site as proof that Conti destroyed all
exfiltrated data after the victim paid the ransom. In another
case, the same site was used to demonstrate that Conti
could — and planned to — decrypt the victim’s files upon
payment, with the victim uploading sample encrypted files
and the threat actor returning their decrypted versions via
the same file share site. Conti also mentioned using Disk
Wipe, a free Windows application for permanent volume data
destruction, to delete the victim’s files they exfiltrated after
the victim paid the ransom.
Conti also uses a variety of other publicly available tools
in their operations, based on our observations in CTIR
engagements and open-source reporting. These tools and
utilities enable every phase of their attack, including initial
access, discovery, persistence, lateral movement, defense
evasion and more. In addition to these publicly available
tools, such as Cobalt Strike and ADFind, Conti also leverages
utilities that are natively found on Windows operating
systems, such as Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI), the Windows command-line utility Nltest, and remote
desktop protocol (RDP).
In one instance, we observed the Conti operator
making vague references to additional TTPs, including the
infection vector. The actor informed the victim that they had
infiltrated the victim’s network, “researched them, and found
critical vulnerabilities, which enabled [Conti] to access and
exfiltrate [the victim’s] documentation and encrypt [their]
file servers, SQL servers, subdomains, and local networks.”
Based on our observations in CTIR engagements, Conti
actors leverage many different vulnerabilities for initial
access and lateral movement. Specifically, we have seen
them exploit the widely reported vulnerabilities affecting the
Apache Log4j logging utility. We have also observed Conti
targeting vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers as the point
of initial infection via PowerShell execution of webshells,
according to CTIR findings. This serves as a reminder of the
importance of organizations applying a patch management
system and keeping all software up-to-date with proper
security updates.

We also gleaned some insight into Conti’s dwell time, with
an operator mentioning in one conversation that they had
infiltrated the victim’s network and “stayed there for 18
days,” which, the actor noted, was enough time to “study
all [of the victim’s] documentation and gain access to [the
victim’s] files and services.” Dwell time, or the amount of
time an adversary has access to a victim’s network, is often
difficult to discern during incident response engagements.
An organization may have insufficient logging and/or the
initial infection vector is usually difficult to identify in most
cases, adding to the challenge of pinpointing the exact
timeframe an adversary may have gained access. In an
April 2022 report, security researchers noted Conti activity
spanned 19 days, which is highly consistent with the
operator’s claim.

HIVE
COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES
Hive’s communication style differed significantly from
Conti based on our observations. Compared to Conti’s
somewhat scripted, more professional tone that mostly
followed the same format across many conversations, Hive
operators seem far more informal and less disciplined, with
the conversations’ structure varying greatly and actors
sometimes exhibiting poor operational security.
Hive’s greeting — “Hello and welcome to Hive. How may I
help you?” — is much shorter and more direct than Conti’s
introduction. The Hive operators do not lead with a full
explanation of what happened to the victim, but instead jump
right into ransom negotiations, informing the victim of how
much money it will take to decrypt their files with little to no
context. We saw Hive provide some generic, bulleted points
on these topics, but they were much less detailed than
those from Conti. Figure 2 shows an example, which was
mentioned immediately after Hive greeted the victim and
informed them of the ransom amount.
As seen from this excerpt, which is largely representative
of the general tone of all the Hive chats we reviewed, the
exchange is short, direct, and not customized for the specific
victim. Separately, we observed a few instances of Hive
mentioning that they would provide the victim with a security
report upon payment, but we did not see such a report
provided in the communications we analyzed.

indicating their initial figure is rarely their bottom offer.
The deduction percentage varied widely across victims
and did not appear to follow any particular rule or structure.
Observed deductions included 10, 15 and 25 percent and
even upwards of 30 and 66 percent in other cases. These
changes to the ransom demand were usually made rather
easily, with little to no hesitation. However, Hive was quick
to drastically increase ransom demands as punishment
for lagging victim responses, as previously highlighted. In
terms of victims, Hive confirmed that they target all industry
verticals rather than focusing on certain sectors
like healthcare.

Figure 2. Example of communications between Hive ransomware
actors and a victim.

Hive almost never employs any of the persuasion
strategies we observed with Conti, such as marketing
ploys, fear, or coercion. In the few times we did observe a
Hive operator attempt to use persuasive language, it was
short, matter-of-fact, and usually prompted by a question
from the victim rather than Hive leading with a forceful
appeal. We also observed Hive quickly become more
aggressive if the victim failed to respond to the ransomware
operator’s initial greeting. In one case, after a victim failed
to respond 14 days after Hive’s initial communication,
the Hive operator declared that their patience was gone
and threatened to send a copy of the victim’s data to the
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), a Hong Kong
regulatory agency. The operator even provided individual
email addresses of SFC members he planned to send
the data to. Hive operators also quickly and dramatically
increased the ransom demand if the victim did not respond,
as seen in the excerpt above, where the ransom payment
eventually jumped from $2 million to $10 million after seven
days without communication from the victim.
RANSOM NEGOTIATIONS
Hive’s ransom demands are typically valued at 1
percent of the victim company’s annual revenue, according
to Hive operators. Based on our analysis, we largely found
this to be the case, but in some instances, the ransom
was slightly higher at around 1.5 percent. Much like Conti,
Hive appears very willing to lower their ransom demand,

© 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. | talosintelligence.com

Just like most other ransomware groups, Hive communicates
with its victims via a chat portal hosted on The Onion Router
(TOR). In their ransom notes, Hive provides the same TOR
URL but delivers custom login credentials for each victim,
which they use to log in to the chat portal to communicate
with the ransomware operators.
Upon logging in, the victim’s custom page is displayed
(Figure 3), with the chat dialogue displayed in the center.
The company’s profile is featured on the left, which includes
the organization’s name, a brief summary of the entity, the
company’s website, and figures representing its revenue and
number of employees. The right side of the page features
a countdown to the payment deadline, a link to download
the decryption software, and Hive’s ransom demand and
corresponding Bitcoin address to submit payment.
We observed one instance in which a Hive operator
appeared to reward the victim communicant for helping
negotiate the deal with the victim. In that exchange, the
negotiator asked the Hive operator to keep 70 percent of the
ransom amount upon payment and give the remaining 30
percent to themselves. The Hive actor ultimately agreed to
give the negotiator 10 percent once the payment was made.
In several cases, we observed negotiators operating on the
victim’s behalf, but this was the only instance where we saw
Hive collaborate with them and share profits.
While this may have been an anomaly, it could represent
ransomware actors’ willingness to receive payment by
any means. This payoff to the victim negotiator, combined
with both Hive and Conti’s propensity to lower ransom
demands, reinforces the notion that these operators are
highly opportunistic and will make compromises during
their operations to compel victims to pay. This theme is also
reinforced by Hive’s admission that they do not focus on
targeting any particular industry, suggesting instead that they

indiscriminately target organizations they may perceive are
the easiest to compromise or extort.
This exchange between Hive and the negotiator may also
represent the lack of standard operating procedures within
the Hive group. Relatedly, it possibly represents the potential
for individual affiliates to be either less disciplined — or
more innovative, depending on one’s interpretation — during
their operations to do anything necessary to convince
their victims to pay. The notion of being undisciplined is
strengthened by another observation we made, mentioned
in the next section, where we saw when a Hive affiliate
displayed poor operational security.

OPERATIONAL INSIGHTS AND TTPS
The Hive operators revealed a surprising amount of
information about various components of their operation,
including details pertaining to the ransomware payload, the
encryption process, and various tools and communication
platforms they use. They mentioned that the ransomware
payload is unique or custom for each individual victim,
noting that for this reason, the file hash will not be useful for
security personnel and network defenders. The operators
were also forthcoming about sharing the ransomware hash
with the victim when asked, even going so far as to
provide the VirusTotal URL linking directly to the file
sample in one case.

In one of the communications we reviewed, the Hive
operator stated that it is impossible to recover the
decryption keys from memory and decrypt files. The
ransomware overwrites the decryption key in memory to
prevent its recovery.
In terms of the encryption process, the threat actor revealed
that the ransomware only encrypts about 100KB of each
file, including the first 4KB, the last 4KB, and several blocks
in the middle of the file. The Hive operator noted that the
ransomware acts fast, which is probably enabled by this
partial encryption. The Hive ransomware is not aware
ahead of time how big or small the files are that it will need
to encrypt, so it has to make a tradeoff decision between
speed and accuracy. That tradeoff is seen in the ransomware
encrypting files quickly, but not thoroughly. Mistakes the
Hive developers made in their encryption schema make key
recovery trivial. The malware only partially encrypts files,
and reuses a small key for every file it encrypts. The Hive
malware authors likely thought they were being clever by
overwriting the key in memory after the encryption process
was complete to prevent investigators from recovering the
key directly from device memory, but they were not clever
enough to realize that they made the classic cryptography
blunder of one-time-pad reuse, which allows the user to
recover the key simply by comparing the encrypted contents
together bitwise. This type of error suggests the malware
developers are not well-versed in crucial cryptography
mechanisms. We assess that many other ransomware
groups likely have similarly glaring problems, especially the
ones that advertise speed as a performance metric.
The encryption process is started by a random field value,
according to the Hive operator, and after the encryption
is completed, the program overwrites the area of memory
where the key was stored to prevent key recovery. They note
that private and public RSA keys are only used to encrypt/
decrypt the random field value, and it is only possible to
decrypt the files if you know that random field value. While
the actor specified the “random field” is not generated by
a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), this detail
appeared to be a sarcastic comment made in jest, based
on the context of the chat. A PRNG is an algorithm used to
create a value which appears random, and is often used as a
seed to generate entropy in cryptography systems for tasks
related to key security and modes of operation.
They also noted that encryption is done using public
RSA keys, decryption is done using private RSA keys. It's
important to note this is only the case for encrypting the

© 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. | talosintelligence.com

symmetric key used, not the victims’ files. In other words,
Hive only uses asymmetric RSA public key encryption for
securing the symmetric key used to encrypt all the files, an
important distinction.
The Hive operator confirms the generated key is re-used to
encrypt all the files. They then state it is “exported,” possibly
meaning “written,” to "disk using a few RSA public keys
applied." This possibly means RSA public key encryption
is used to encrypt the key on disk. After the file content
encryption routine is done, the key is re-written to prevent
recovery from memory. This suggests the key used for file
content encryption is a symmetric key, which is obscured
by a public key routine. The affiliate further states the
decryption software has RSA private keys used to decrypt
the exported (presumably symmetric) key, which is then
used to decrypt file contents. It appears that the actors mean
the symmetric key is stored in memory, but the key itself is
encrypted using RSA public key encryption. If this is the
case, it would be difficult to recover the key even if it was
not over-written later in the execution. However, it does not
matter what the actors do to try and hide the key during the
encryption process; the problem resides with symmetric
key reuse in the first place, which allows a person who only
has access to the encrypted file contents to then shake out
the symmetric key by comparing the encrypted files to each
other bitwise. Separately, the Hive operator also noted that
the key file usually has the extension “*.key.*” — such as
“.key.frg.15” —and is typically located at the root directory of
shared folders, according to the Hive actor.
In this same conversation, the Hive actor said that they
use “some kind of Vernam’s cipher,” not an AES cipher,
for encryption. This speaks to the key length constraints
mentioned above: Notably, Vernam’s cipher — a simple
substitution cipher — requires the key length to be the same
as the message text length, which is possibly why only
100KB of each file is encrypted.
This detailed account of Hive’s ransomware and encryption
process underscores the actor’s poor operational security.
During these conversations, the Hive operator noted that
they had never disclosed this encryption information to
anyone before, raising questions about why they elected to
share such details in that particular instance. It is possible
that they were boasting about that component of their
operation and they simply did not understand, or care
about, the significance of sharing this type of information.
Regardless, these disclosures again suggest a lack of

"Almost all antiviruses are
useless against real hackers."
- Hive operator to victim
discipline or standard operating procedure, as well as a
strong disregard for safeguarding sensitive information.
We note that these chats predate the recent research
published by researchers from South Korea's Kookmin
University detailing a method for decrypting files infected
with Hive ransomware. The Korean Internet and Security
Agency (KISA) released a recovery tool about a month
later. Based on more recent Hive-victim conversations from
March that we obtained, the ransomware operators appear
to be using their updated encryptor and imply that any other
decryption tool would be useless. For example, in their initial
greetings with victims, they now state, "Please note that it
is updated encryptor, there is no way to decrypt files other
than to pay." Hive updated their ransomware in early March
to address the encryption flaws revealed by the researchers,
according to open-source reports. In late March, the
actors made additional updates, converting their VMware
ESXi Linux encryptor to the Rust programming language
and adding new features to make it harder for security
researchers to monitor their negotiations with victims.
This indicates that the Hive developers are still very active
and intent on continuing their operations despite repeated
setbacks by security researchers and government efforts to
thwart their activities.
In addition to these specific revelations about encryption
methods, Hive also provided some more general insight
into their operations, mentioning in one exchange that
they did not put much effort into trying to evade detection.
This confidence in their operations was echoed in other
communications, where they flaunted their reputation,
the ransomware’s encryption speed, and skills at evading
detection, noting in one exchange that, “Almost all
antiviruses are useless against real hackers.” Despite the
actor’s claim, we have observed Hive using some defense
evasion tactics based on CTIR data, including abusing
msiexec.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads,
deleting shadow copies, clearing Windows event logs,

© 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. | talosintelligence.com

and modifying and/or disabling security tools, such as
antivirus software, to avoid detection of their malware,
tools and activities.
Similar to Conti, Hive uses a combination of tools and utilities
found natively on the victim’s operating system, such as
RDP, PsExec, and msiexec, PowerShell, along with publicly
available tools like Cobalt Strike, AnyDesk and others,
according to CTIR findings. They also use various file sharing
sites, such as PrivatLab and ProtonMail to communicate with
victims, based on the communications we reviewed.

GENERAL GUIDANCE AND MITIGATION
STRATEGIES
These conversations revealed that, like many
cybercriminals, Conti and Hive are opportunistic actors
who likely seek to compromise victims through the easiest
and fastest means possible, which often include exploiting
known vulnerabilities. This is a reminder to all organizations
to implement a strong patch management system and
keep all systems up-to-date. Another way to mitigate the
threat of adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities is to monitor
for suspicious network traffic, such as large quantities or
anomalous activity that could be indicative of scanning.
Threat actors may conduct vulnerability scanning to
collect host information that can be used to identify
exploitable or unpatched software and applications.
Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software
and version numbers, listening ports or other network
artifacts to identify any weaknesses.
Organizations should also perform general system
hardening that includes removing services or protocols
running on endpoints where they are unnecessary. Ensure
that unnecessary ports and services are closed to prevent
the risk of discovery and potential exploitation. Additionally,
organizations should consider hardening devices, including
systems, networks, and security devices, to minimize and
limit the success of any attacks. This includes actively adding
applications to the allowlist and blocklist in order to control
which programs are operating on your system.
It is also essential for organizations to implement policies to
prevent adversaries from using credentials that are either
sold on dark web cybercriminal forums or that have been
leaked in other data breaches. Organizations should require
employees to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to

provide a higher level of security and ensure that leaked or
stolen credentials cannot be used to access systems and
resources. Creating long, complex passwords and enabling
MFA will help prevent threat actors from using stolen or
default and valid credentials. If feasible, require MFA for all
users with administrative privileges, as well as external login
and remote access methods for applications used within
the environment. MFA is the most effective method for
preventing remote-based compromises and can stop access
to compromised accounts by requiring all users to provide a
second form of authentication.
If valid accounts are compromised or leveraged,
conduct a full password reset, especially for all privileged
accounts in the domain. The lack of MFA remains one
of the biggest impediments to enterprise security. Many
ransomware and phishing incidents could have been
prevented if MFA had been properly enabled on critical
services, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or endpoint
detection response (EDR) solutions.
