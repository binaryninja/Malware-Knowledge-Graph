government entities with MailDropper implants

Very recently another custom malicious implant that seems to be related to APT34 (aka OilRig)
has been uploaded to a major malware analysis platform. Since 2014, year in which FireEye
spotted out this hacking group, APT34 is well-known to conduct cyber operations primarily in the
Middle East, mainly targeting ﬁnancial, government, energy, chemical and telecommunications
sector.
In this case, the threat group probably compromised a Microsoft Exchange account of a sensitive
entity related to Lebanese government, and used the mail server as command-and-control of the
implant. All the trafﬁc between the compromised machine and the C2 is conveyed through legit
email messages, making the implant identiﬁcation harder. The victim seems to be a Lebanese
government entity, so it’s possible to guess that the APT group exploited the trust towards the ﬁrst
entity to compromise others and to hide its malicious operations.

APT34 is believed to be a a threat actor close to Iranian government in consideration of the fact
that it conducts operations aligned with the interests of this country. Over the time this group has
been observed to carry out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between their
primary targets and others organizations. Over the time, many malware families have also been
associated with this group including ISMAgent, ISMDoor, ISMInjector, TwoFace and, at the time
of this analysis, the MailDropper one.

Behavior Analysis
The malware is delivered through spear-phishing email messages. The infection starts with a
macro-armed Excel document. The Macro contains a base64 encoded executable payload,
copied as “monitor.exe”, which will be deployed in a just created folder, named “.Monitor” under
“C:\Users\Public”. Through the usage of Windows Task Scheduler, “monitor.exe” is added to a
new task, named “SystemErrorReporter”, whose execution is scheduled every minute.
Analyzing the resources embedded into “monitor.exe”, it is possible to discover some further
information, such as the credentials used to access a Microsoft Exchange server hosted in
Lebanon. For privacy reasons, the primary communication server will not be publicly released.

hardcoded credentials of the implant

We guess the attackers have compromised the account “media@xxx.local”, belonging to the
local domain of the targeted institution, and used it to perform malicious operations. In this
speciﬁc case, the access to the mail server is used by the malware to get a list of commands to
be executed through the retrieving and parsing of a CMD list. So, it acts like a command-andcontrol server.

Retrieving and parsing CMDs

If the mail server is down or deny the access, the malware uses a backup URL,
“hxxp://godoycrus.com” to get the commands list, according to the evidences below:

Switch between Command and Control servers

The malware is capable to perform the following primary operations:
[+] arbitrary commands execution
[+] download and upload of ﬁles
[+] data exﬁltration
The following is a extraction of the commands handling code snippet:

Code handling code snippet

Interesting the way through which the malware retrieves the commands from the mail server. It
access to the Inbox folder and search for emails containing a speciﬁc subject:
“Resume7AKF1PMAVAHI7SYK”. If one or more emails are found, the malware tries to extract
the content of the attachment ﬁles, that corresponds to a Base64-encoded command that should
be executed.

Once the attachments are inspected, the current email is deﬁnitely deleted using the
“HardDelete” ﬂag. In this way the email message does not even appear in the trash folder.
As shown above, the retrieved commands are executed using the “ExecAllCmds” method and
the result is sent to the C2 through the “SendResult” method. If the malware is using the
Exchange server as C2, the output of the commands execution is sent as email message. Once
again, the malware uses a speciﬁc pattern to build the email: its subject is build starting from the

string “Great! 7AKF1PMAVAHI7SYK”, appending the current date to it. The email body contains
only the string “This is our reusme!” (showing with a syntax error) and the attachment is a “.txt”
ﬁle named “resume.txt”, which contains the encoded information returned by the commands
execution. The following image is another evidence about what observed:

All the data exchanged between the implant and the server is encrypted using an AES+RSA
schema. The data is ﬁrst ciphered using AES algorithm with an auto-generated key, then the key
is encrypted using RSA and prepended to the data that will be sent to the server, as shown
following:

Persistence
The malware grants its persistence on the victim machine using the Windows Task Scheduler. It
creates a new task pointing to “C:\Users\Public\.Monitor\monitor.exe”, starting the malicious
payload every minute.

Attribution
The analyzed sample has some similarities with DNSpionage, the remote administrative tool
developed by APT34 and analyzed by Talos Group in 2019 (ref.
https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/dnspionage-brings-out-karkoff.html). We can
summarize some characteristics in common:
both the implant targeted Lebanon;

in both cases the initial document is an Excel ﬁle containing macro: in DNSpionage the
content of the document is the only string “haha you are donkey”, but in the last case it is
totally empty;
both the samples use dot in the created folder name, which is “.msonedrive” in
DNSpionage and “.Monitor” in the last sample;
both the campaigns employ .NET payload.

Telemetry
At the time of this analysis, this implant seems to be used exclusively in the Lebanese region,
conﬁrming the targeted nature of the implant.
