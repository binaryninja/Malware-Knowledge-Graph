Take a “NetWalk” on the Wild Side
mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/take-a-netwalk-on-the-wild-side/
August 3, 2020

Executive Summary
The NetWalker ransomware, initially known as Mailto, was first detected in August 2019.
Since then, new variants were discovered throughout 2019 and the beginning of 2020, with a
strong uptick noticed in March of this year.
NetWalker has noticeably evolved to a more stable and robust ransomware-as-a-service
(RaaS) model, and our research suggests that the malware operators are targeting and
attracting a broader range of technically advanced and enterprising criminal affiliates.
McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) discovered a large sum of bitcoins linked to
NetWalker which suggest its extortion efforts are effective and that many victims have had no
option other than to succumb to its criminal demands.

We approached our investigation of NetWalker with some possible ideas about the threat
actor behind it, only to later disprove our own hypothesis. We believe the inclusion of our
thinking, and the means with which we debunked our own theory, highlight the importance of
thorough research and we welcome further discussion on this topic. We believe it starts
valuable discussions and helps avoid duplicate research efforts by others. We also
encourage our peers in the industry to share information with us in case you have more
evidence.

Introduction
Since 2019, NetWalker ransomware has reached a vast number of different targets, mostly
based in western European countries and the US. Since the end of 2019, the NetWalker
gang has indicated a preference for larger organisations rather than individuals. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the adversaries behind NetWalker clearly stated that hospitals will not
be targeted; whether they keep to their word remains to be seen.
The ransomware appends a random extension to infected files and uses Salsa20 encryption.
It uses some tricks to avoid detection, such as a new defence evasion technique, known as
reflective DLL loading, to inject a DLL from memory.
The NetWalker collective, much like those behind Maze, REvil and other ransomware,
threatens to publish victims’ data if ransoms are not paid.
As mentioned earlier, NetWalker RaaS prioritizes quality over quantity and is looking for
people who are Russian-speaking and have experience with large networks. People who
already have a foothold in a potential victim’s network and can exfiltrate data with ease are
especially sought after. This is not surprising, considering that publishing a victims’ data is
part of NetWalker’s model.
The following sections are dedicated to introducing the NetWalker malware and displaying
the telemetry status before moving on to the technical malware analysis of the ransomware’s
behaviour. We will explain how the decryptor works and show some interactions between
NetWalker’s operators and their victims. After this, we discuss the changes in modus
operandi since September 2019, especially regarding payment behaviour. Then we show our

attempts, unfruitful as they were, at discovering a link between NetWalker and previous,
seemingly unrelated ransomware variants. Finally, we deliver an overview of IOCs related to
NetWalker and its MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Telemetry
Using McAfee’s billion Insights sensors, we can show the global prevalence of the NetWalker
ransomware.

Technical Analysis
Ransom note (pre-March 2020)
Before March 2020, the NetWalker ransom note indicated how to contact the adversary
directly using anonymous email account services with random names (such as
kkeessnnkkaa@cock.li and hhaaxxhhaaxx@tuta.io):

Ransom Note (Post-March 2020)
On 12 March 2020, a researcher shared a screenshot of a new NetWalker ransom note in a
tweet and we can see that the attackers have changed the contact method significantly.
Email communication has been dropped completely with victims now required to make
contact through the NetWalker Tor interface where, after submitting their user key, they will
then be redirected to a chat with NetWalker technical support. This change in contact method
coincides with underground forum postings where NetWalker revealed it was opening its
RaaS up for new affiliates. The Tor page was not the only noticeable change we will highlight
in this blog.

NetWalker Resource Analysis (Pre-March 2020)

6/32

The NetWalker malware uses a custom resource type (1337 or 31337) containing its entire
configuration. This file is extracted to memory and decrypted using the RC4 algorithm with a
hard-coded key in the resource.
Before 12 March 2020, NetWalker used the email contact process between its support
operation and the victims to proceed with payment and send the decryption program. To do
this, NetWalker used its configuration file in the resource to set its encryption mode, the
name of the ransom note, etc., and email contacts.

NetWalker Resource Analysis (Post-March 2020)
When Netwalker changed its contact mode and switched from email to the submission of the
user key directly on the web portal of the group’s blog, the configuration file in the resource
also changed. We found changes in the configuration file, such as the disappearance of the
contact “mail” and “crmask” fields (previously set as XXX@cock.li,XXX@tuta.io, etc., and
.mailto[email].{ID}). This field was replaced by “onion1” and “onion2”, and these fields are set
with the NetWalker blog URL/payment page (hxxp://rnfdsgm<snip>drqqd.onion/). We also
noticed that the NetWalker developers complemented their “unlocker” field with some
specific values (e.g. “psexec.exe, system, forti*.exe, fmon.exe*, etc”).

Figure 6. NetWalker resource from cnt.ex
Usually, attackers use RC_DATA or a malicious BITMAP. The latter can, for example, be a
regular Bitmap (open matrix image format used by Windows) that can be used by malware to
execute code or as a payload dropper. The image’s pixels are an actual binary
representation of the payload. This process can be summarized as Exe -> Resources ->
BMP with embedded data in pixels fetched and decrypted by, e.g. a DLL -> Payload), etc.
However, in this case, they use this special custom type to increase obfuscation. The
NetWalker developers chose custom types by using 1337 or 31337 structs, so the resource
format does not change. However, as we said, several values have changed or been

Compile time

2 May 2020

The unpacked malware is a binary file of 32 bits that can be found as an EXE file.

Figure 7. Information sample of the malware

10/32

The malware’s first action is to combine all the required functions it needs into one large
function, combining the modules already loaded in Windows with additional DLLs as
described below.
Instead of searching for the function in the usual way, the malware makes a CRC32 hash of
the name of each function and compares with hardcoded values. Additionally, instead of
using the function “GetProcAddress”, the malware uses the Process Environment Block
(PEB) to make analysis harder.

Figure 8. Get the module accessing the PEB and using a CRC32
If the module cannot be discovered, it will load with “LdrLoadDll”, a native function of
Windows, to try avoiding hooks in the usual functions, e.g. “LoadLibraryW”:

11/32

Figure 9. Load library using LdrLoadDll

Figure 10. Get functions from module, e.g. using a CRC32 hash
If the malware fails to get a function, it will go to a “sleep” call and terminate itself.
Later, the malware extracts the configuration file from a resource with a custom type and a
custom name using the functions “FindResourceA”, “LockResource”, “LoadResource” and
“SizeOfResource”. The file extracted in memory is decrypted using the RC4 algorithm with a
hardcoded key in the resource.
The struct of the resource is:
12/32

4 bytes -> The size of the hardcoded key to decrypt the configuration file.
Variable size -> the hardcoded key to decrypt the configuration file.
Variable size -> the configuration file encrypted.
The malware reads the first 4 bytes and reserves memory with the size of the password and
reserves memory of the resource minus 4 bytes and the size of the password. Finally, it
decrypts the configuration file:

Figure 11. Get configuration file and decrypt it
If the malware fails to get the configuration file, it will terminate itself.
After getting the configuration file, the malware will parse it and save the fields in memory
and write in the registry information to encrypt the files in the machine. The malware will try
first to write in the registry-hive “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE” but if it cannot create it, it will
use the registry-hive “HKEY_CURRENT_USER”:

13/32

Figure 12. Write in the registry
After the writing in the registry has been completed, it will get some privileges using a token
as SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE and SE_IMPERSONATE_PRIVILEGE:

Figure 13. Get some special privileges in the token

14/32

Later, the malware creates three threads, one to get information about the machine, such as
the operating system version, one to get processes and the last one to get services in the
system.
After this step, it will get the system directory and use “VSSadmin” to delete the Volume
Shadow copies of the system. Volume Shadow copies can contain copies of the encrypted
files and would be an option to restore from if no backup exists.

Figure 14. Delete the shadow volumes
Later, the malware will enumerate the logical units, prepare the new extension for the future
encrypted files, based on the size that is defined in the ransomware config with a random
extension, and encrypt all files in the fixed type units and remote units with the new
extension.

15/32

Figure 15. Crypt the files
After all these steps have been completed, it will create the ransom note on the desktop
using the functions “SHGetFolderPathlW” and “CreateFileW”. Subsequently, it will write the
ransom note from the memory into a new file with the function “WriteFile”. The malware will
create the ransom note in the root folder (for example “c:\”) of each logical unit. Next, it will
launch “notepad.exe” with an argument to the ransom note file to show the user what
happened on the system:

Figure 16. Creation of the ransom note in the desktop and root units
Finally, after the encryption of the files and creation of the ransom note, the malware creates
a bat file in the %temp% folder of the machine with a temporary name and writes the content
to destroy itself using the program “taskkill”. The batch script will delete the malware sample
with its path using the command “del” and finally delete the bat file with the command “del
%0%”. Of course, as the malware uses the “del” command without destroying itself before
the deletion, it can be recovered with some forensic tools with luck (the same can also be
said for the bat file).
This way the malware tries to remove itself from the machine to avoid being detected and
analyzed by security researchers:
16/32

Figure 17. Get Temp path and make a temporary file as a bat and launch it
Finally, the malware will finish with “ExitProcess”.

Decryptor
When a NetWalker victim goes through technical support (see an example of this below) and
pays the ransom demanded by the group they will be able to download the decryptor to
clean up their environment.

Figure 18. Conversation with NetWalker operators

17/32

The download is done directly from the NetWalker Tor site, where the payment page
switches to a download page certifying that the payment was made and received:

Figure 19. Decryptor download
The decryptor is delivered in a zip archive containing the decryptor executable and a note
explaining how to run the program correctly:

18/32

Figure 20. Decryptor delivery
The program launches a graphical interface allowing the user to decipher their workstation
automatically or manually:

19/32

Figure 21. Decryptor execution
At the end of the decryption process, the program indicates the number of decrypted files,
deletes the ransom note if the user has checked that option, and terminates, leaving the user
to resume their work peacefully:

Figure 22. Decryptor has finished the decryption process
The decryptor program appears unique and is linked to one victim specifically. In our
example, it only decrypts the files belonging to the victim who made the payment from the
user key specified in the ransom note.

Underground Advertising
In March 2020, the moniker Bugatti began actively advertising the NetWalker Ransomwareas-a-Service on two popular underground fora. Bugatti seems to have joined the
underground scene in February 2020 but claims to have been active with NetWalker
ransomware since September 2019. We have seen NetWalker activity before March but
there has been a noticeable uptick in larger victims since their advertisement. For a relatively
new ransomware it has been well received and respected among other cybercriminals as
compared to, for instance, Nemty ransomware. The strength of NetWalker’s reputation is
such that our current hypothesis is that the individual behind Bugatti is most likely a wellrespected and experienced cybercriminal, even though it is a new moniker.

20/32

Figure 23. Bugatti advertising NetWalker on an underground forum
Bugatti provides regular updates on the improvements in the ransomware, such as the
popular Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection method, also commonly used by Sodinokibi. In addition
to the improvements in the ransomware, open slots for new affiliates are advertised. Bugatti
strongly emphasized that they are primarily looking for experienced affiliates that focus on
compromising the complete networks of organizations as opposed to end users. NetWalker
is clearly following in the footsteps of its illustrious targeted ransomware peers like
Sodinokibi, Maze and Ryuk.
One forum message in particular caught our attention as it included screenshots of several
partial bitcoin addresses and USD amounts. This was most likely done to showcase the
financial success of the ransomware. We have seen a similar posting in the past with the
influential Sodinokibi affiliate Lalartu, so we decided to follow the money once more.

Following the Money
In the transactions mentioned in the underground forum post, the ransom amount payed by
the victims is presumably shown. Since the bitcoin blockchain is a publicly accessible ledger,
we can follow the money and see where the ransomware actors are transferring it to. In the
case of the four posted transactions above, the full amount payed by the victim was
transferred to two addresses (these addresses begin with bc1q98 and 1DgLhG respectively).
It is safe to say that these two bitcoin addresses are under control of the NetWalker actors.
We then proceeded on to analyze all incoming transactions to these two addresses and we
were able to make the following observations:
The first incoming transaction occurs on 1 March 2020.
On 30 March 2020 the first incoming transaction appears where the amount is split
between 4 different bitcoin addresses. A split like this is typically seen in Ransomwareas-a-Service, where the ransom payment is split between the RaaS operators and the
affiliate who caused the infection. In this first transaction, the split is 80%, 10% and two
5% portions. This split matches the advertisement on the underground forum (80% –
20%).
The two 5% portions of the ransom payments that are split, seem to be consistently
transferred to the two bitcoin addresses we revealed earlier (bc1q98 and 1DgLhG).
While the beneficiaries of the 5% cuts remain the same, the beneficiary of the 10% cut
seems to change over time. Based on the forum post we assume these addresses also
belong to the NetWalker actors.
Payments to the bc1q98 and 1DgLhG addresses that are not being split continue up
until the end of May. Possibly the initial NetWalker operators added a RaaS operation,
while continuing to cause NetWalker infections themselves.

23/32

While analyzing the bitcoin addresses that received 80% or more of the transaction
amount, we noticed that there are some addresses that receive payments multiple
times. A possible explanation could be that the address is configured as payout
addresses for a certain campaign or affiliate. We identified 30 unique bitcoin addresses
that seem to be the beneficiary of this larger portion of the ransom transaction. Some of
these only received one payment but there are several that received multiple
payments.
In the two addresses uncovered by tracing the transactions a total of 641 bitcoin is held
on 27 July 2020. Which at the current market value of bitcoin is worth well over 7
million USD.

Amounts Extorted
Working under the hypothesis that all the incoming transactions are ransomware payments;
we can make the following observations:
We found 23 transactions where the ransom payments were not split up and the
beneficiaries are the two bitcoin addresses found by following the transactions
mentioned in the underground forum post. The total amount of bitcoin extorted this way
between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020 is 677 BTC. Additionally, the amount received
from remaining transactions following the Ransomware-as-a-Service scheme by these
addresses between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020 is 188 BTC.
In the transactions that are split, the largest amount (usually 80% to 90% of the total
transaction value) is presumably transferred to the affiliate that caused the infection.
When we summed up these largest portions, we saw a total of 1723 BTC being
transferred to affiliates.
The total amount of extorted bitcoin that has been uncovered by tracing transactions to
these NetWalker related addresses is 2795 BTC between 1 March 2020 and 27 July
2020. By using historic bitcoin to USD exchange rates, we estimate a total of 25 million
USD was extorted with these NetWalker related transactions.
Even though we do not have complete visibility into the BTC flow before NetWalker started
ramping up, one thing is certain, this quarter alone it has been highly successful at extorting
organisations for large amounts of money. All this at a time when many sectors are struggling
because people are sheltering in place and governments are trying to keep businesses from
going bankrupt. NetWalker is making millions off the backs of legitimate companies.

24/32

addresses.

Observed Changes
While talking about the impact of NetWalker with our partners, we learned that the change in
modus operandi not only affected the way the actors communicate with their victims. When
there was a change from email communication to a dedicated Tor hidden service, the actors
also moved away from using legacy bitcoin addresses to SegWit addresses. The benefits of
using the newer SegWit addresses include faster transaction time and lower transaction
cost. The NetWalker advertisement on the underground forum mentions instant and fully

25/32

automatic payments around the time of this observed change. This makes us believe the
ransomware actors were professionalizing their operation just before expanding to the
Ransomware-as-a-Service model.

Comparison with Previous Ransomware
Given the sudden appearance of NetWalker ransomware and the associated threat actor, it
suggests that some prior knowledge on ransomware development or underground presence
had to be in place. Armed with this hypothesis, we searched for possible links to
underground actors and other ransomware strains that might fit the bill. We came across one
threat actor offering ransomware that caught our attention. It was the use of the name
NetWalker, in combination with a strong ransomware connection, that sparked our interest.
Some years ago, a threat actor using the moniker Eriknetwalker was advertising ransomware
on several underground forums. We found posts from 2016 and the latest public activity was
around June 2019, several months before NetWalker ransomware made its appearance.

Figure 26. Eriknetwalker began advertising their ransomware in 2016 (Google-translated
from Russian)
Based on our underground research, we linked the moniker Eriknetwalker to the
development and/or distribution of Amnesia, Bomber and Scarab ransomware. Eriknetwalker
stopped advertising ransomware around June 2019. Therefore, we decided to perform a
comparative analysis between the different ransomware strains linked to Eriknetwalker and
some of the earliest versions of NetWalker we could find.
26/32

The goal of this comparative analysis was to identify whether there was an overlap between
source codes. Such overlap could suggest a stronger link between the current NetWalker
version and the other ransomware versions from Eriknetwalker, possibly even explaining the
name overlap.
To execute the analysis, we used several tools one of which was the binary visualization tool
Veles, which dynamically translates binary information into an abstract visualization that
allows us to identify and compare patterns.
The different types of ransomware we began analyzing were the variants of Amnesia,
Scarab, and NetWalker.

Figure 27. Flat visualization of binary data of the different ransomware variants

27/32

Figure 28. 3D visualization of binary data of the different ransomware variants
Visualizing data in such a manner is a way to use the human brain to quickly identify patterns
and be able to draw comparisons between objects. In our case, we see that, based on the
binary data visualized in Figures 27 and 28, the ransomware binaries do yield differences
that we cannot ignore.

28/32

Figure 29. Comparison of source code results
Figure 29 shows the results of a source code similarity analysis led on the different variants
of ransomware named in the figure itself. Interesting enough, Scarab and Amnesia show a
higher overlap with Buran and Zeppelin than the early NetWalker samples. The percentages
shown are the amount of code that is similar between two variants.
As illustrated in the overview, the September 2019 NetWalker version has a different
codebase from the ErikNetWalker-linked ransomware variants. This finding disproves our
earlier hypothesis that NetWalker is linked to the older Amnesia variants based on code
overlap.
Often, research teams do not publish their results when it disproves their own hypothesis.
However, for the sake of transparency, we decided to include our research efforts.

YARA Rules
We uploaded a YARA rule to detect almost all the samples observed in the wild to date.

Conclusion
Ransomware has evolved into a lucrative business for threat actors, from underground
forums selling ransomware, to offering services such as support portals to guide victims
through acquiring crypto currency for payment, to the negotiation of the ransom. McAfee’s
Advanced Threat Research team has analysed the NetWalker ransomware and have been
following its evolution from the initial sighting of the Mailto ransomware to its redevelopment
into the NetWalker ransomware. The recent shift to a business-centric model of
Ransomware-as-a-Service is a clear sign that it is stepping up, so it seems that the
NetWalker group is following in the footsteps of REvil and other successful RaaS groups.
The ransomware developers have proven the ability to refocus and capitalize on current
world events and develop lures to help ensure the effectiveness of the ransomware, which
has allowed them to become selective of their affiliates by limiting access to the ransomware
to only those with vetted access to large organizations. As development of the ransomware
continues, we have witnessed recent shifts in activity that closely follow in the footsteps of
other ransomware developments, including threatening victims with the release of
confidential information if the ransom is not met.
