ZLoader Returns Through Spelevo Exploit Kit & Phishing Campaign

Exploit kits (EKs) dominated the cybersecurity industry in 2018 and 2019. These kits were the major, initial infection methods used by hackers
to carry out major malware campaigns or advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks.
In 2020, EKs were not considered a potential threat vector for client-side attacks because phishing attacks and other social engineering
attacks emerged as the significant threat vector. Based on Cyble’s research, we have found that
the recent Spelevo EK targeted the vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash Player.
In the past, the Spelevo EK was found to be delivering payloads such as Ursnif and Qakbot. In a recent campaign in March 2021, we
observed the same EK delivering ZLoader payload files. The Spelevo EK campaign was seen to be targeting US users with the flash
vulnerability. The initial findings can be attributed to Malware Traffic Analysis. The image below showcases the popular PopCash site,
compromised by EK and redirecting to a landing page.

After successful redirection to the landing page, the malicious flash file is dropped on the victim machine based on client vulnerability. The
landing page script and flash file delivery are shown below.

Upon execution of the malicious flash file, it drops and executes the ZLoader payload on the victim’s machine. The
image below showcases the decompiled malicious flash file.

After exploitation, Spelevo EK redirects the user to google.com, typically after a 60-seconds delay, and the code snippet for the same is shown
below.

Spear phishing delivers ZLoader:
ZLoader also targets users through phishing campaigns with maliciously crafted MS Office attachments. As showcased in the image below, we
discovered this campaign to be circulating as a compensation claim.

Upon execution of the malicious macro, it downloads and executes the payload on the victim machine. The attachment also displays a
Security Warning that urges the user to enable macros.

The following Wireshark capture showcases the payload delivery on the victim machine.

Technical analysis of the payload:
The payload file that we have analysed is: SHA256:”9ef6c5467fd80274e6a37e2883a5e83a894cf2148ce37bf0adb1e884acbc4c0b”
It is a VC compiled malware COM DLL file with multiple exports. The following image shows the malware payload file with its export functions.

ZLoader has many anti-debugging, evasion techniques and does process injection. The malware uses other techniques such as custom
encrypted network communication and Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) for command-and-control (C&C) domains etc.
ZLoader is notable variant of the Zeus banking malware which was identified in 2006. This banking malware typically targets users to steal
credentials and other sensitive financial information. Finally, with these stolen credentials threat actors can perform illicit financial
transactions from the victim’s banking account by logging into their devices. It has been observed that after a few months’ break, the same
malware campaign reappears with different Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
Cyble will continue to track these new malware activities to collect advanced threat intelligence related to the campaign.
