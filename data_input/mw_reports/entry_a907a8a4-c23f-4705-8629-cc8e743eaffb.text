Abstract
Imagine a fast moving bot attack designed to render the victim’s hardware from functioning.
Called Permanent Denial of Service attacks (PDoS attacks), this form of cyber-attack is
becoming increasingly popular in 2017 as more incidents involving this hardware-damaging
assault occur.
Also known loosely as “phlashing” in some circles, PDoS is an attack that damages a system
so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. By exploiting security
flaws or misconfigurations, this type of cyber attack can destroy the firmware and/or basic
functions of system. It is a contrast to its well-known cousin, DDoS attacks, which overloads
systems with requests meant to saturate resources through unintended usage.

BrickerBot – Discovery and Analysis of a PDoS Tool

1/4

Over a four-day period, Radware’s honeypot recorded 1,895 PDoS attempts performed from
several locations around the world. Its sole purpose was to compromise IoT devices and
corrupt their storage. Besides this intense, short-lived bot (BrickerBot.1), Radware’s
honeypot recorded attempts from a second, very similar bot (BrickerBot.2) which started
Permanent Denial of Service attempts on the same date – both bots were discovered less
than one hour apart –with lower intensity but more thorough and its location(s) concealed by
TOR egress nodes.
Compromising a Device
The Bricker Bot Permanent Denial of Service attack used Telnet brute force - the same
exploit vector used by Mirai - to breach a victim’s devices. Bricker does not try to download a
binary, so Radware does not have a complete list of credentials that were used for the brute
force attempt, but were able to record that the first attempted username/password pair was
consistently 'root'/'vizxv.’
Corrupting a Device
Upon successful access to the device, the Permanent Denial of Service bot performed a
series of Linux commands that would ultimately lead to corrupted storage, followed by
commands to disrupt Internet connectivity, device performance, and the wiping of all files on
the device. Below is the exact sequence of commands that performed by the Permanent
Denial of Service bots:

special
devices targeted are /dev/mtd (Memory Technology Device - a special device type to match
flash characteristics) and /dev/mmc (MultiMediaCard - a special device type that matches
memory card standard, a solid-state storage medium).
The sysctl commands attempt to reconfigure kernel parameters: net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0
disables TCP timestamps which does not affect local LAN IPv4 connectivity but seriously
impacts the Internet communication, and kernel.threads-max=1 limits the max number of
kernel threads to one. Typically, this is in the 10,000s for ARM-based devices.

Targets
The use of the 'busybox' command combined with the MTD and MMC special devices
means this attack is targeted specifically at Linux/BusyBox-based IoT devices which have
their Telnet port open and exposed publically on the Internet. These are matching the
devices targeted by Mirai or related IoT botnets.

2/4

The PDoS attempts originated from a limited number of IP addresses spread around the
world. All devices are exposing port 22 (SSH) and running an older version of the Dropbear
SSH server. Most of the devices were identified by Shodan as Ubiquiti network devices;
among them are Access Points and Bridges with beam directivity.

In parallel, Radware’s honeypot recorded over 333 PDoS attempts with a different command
signature. The source IP addresses from these attempts are TOR Nodes and hence there is
no identifying the actual source of the attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks are still
ongoing and the attacker/author is using TOR egress nodes to conceal its bot(s). The first
credentials attempted to brute the Telnet login are root/root and root/vizxv. The sequence of
commands performed by this bot are:
Command sequence of BrickerBot.2Figure 5: Command sequence of BrickerBot.2
The commands used in these PDoS attempts are more thorough than the previously
described ones. The targeted storage devices are much broader and there is no use of
'busybox' while attempting both 'dd' and 'cat,’ whichever is available on the breached device.

The Damage
The commands at the end are identical to the previously described PDoS attacks and try to
remove the default gateway, wipe the device through rm -rf /* and disable TCP timestamps
as well as limiting the max number of kernel threads to one. This time however, similar to the
storage corruption commands, extra commands were added to flush all iptables firewall and
NAT rules and add a rule to drop all outgoing packets.
Both PDoS attacks started the same day and approximately the same time: March 20, 2017
9.51PM CET vs March 20, 2017 9.10PM CET. While the first PDoS attacks from BrickerBot.1
have stopped, the attacks from BrickerBot.2, which are less dense but better concealed
using TOR egress nodes, are still active and ongoing.

Protecting IoT Devices and Securing the Network
Change the device’s factory default credentials.
Disable Telnet access to the device.
Network Behavioral Analysis can detect anomalies in traffic and combine with
automatic signature generation for protection.
User/Entity behavioral analysis (UEBA) to spot granular anomalies in traffic early.
3/4

An IPS should block Telnet default credentials or reset telnet connections. Use a
signature to detect the provided command sequences.
