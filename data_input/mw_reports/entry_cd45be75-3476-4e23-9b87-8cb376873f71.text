Yesterday, I stumbled on a post where a Reddit user named Haydaddict was alerting people
about some hacked Steam accounts spreading malware. As I am always interested in new
malware, I took a look to see what could be discovered.
According to the post, the hacked accounts were being used to SPAM suspicious links using
Steam chat. These chat messages would tell the recipient to go to videomeo.pw to watch a
video.

Steam Chats

When the target went to the page, they would be greeted with a message stating that they
needed to update Flash Player in order to watch the video.

Fake Video Page

If a target downloads the installer and executes it, they will find that it does not appear to do
anything. This is because the Flash Player installer is actually a Trojan that executes a
PowerShell script called zaga.ps1, which will download a 7-zip archive, 7-zip extractor, and a
CMD script from the zahr.pw server.

Zaga.ps1 PowerShell Script

Once the files are downloaded, the PowerShell script will then launch the CMD file, which
will extract the sharchivedmngr to the %AppData%\lappclimtfldr folderand configure
Windows to automatically start the mcrtvclient.exe program when a user logs in. This
program is actually a renamed copy of the NetSupport Manager Remote Control Software.
When the program is launched, it will connect to the NetSupport gateway at leyv.pw:11678
and await commands. This allows the attacker to remotely connect to the infected computer
and take control over it.

NetManager Configuration File

For those who are concerned they are infected with this Steam Trojan, I suggest they check
the %AppData% folder for the specified folders.

3/7

Furthermore, all users must be careful with what links they visit and what downloads they
install. These days it is becoming more and more frequent for accounts to be hacked and
then for attackers to use them to distribute malware. Stay vigilant, be careful, and make sure
you have an antivirus software installed.

This is a new varient. Last year one of my steam friend send me a message with a link in
it. But it was automated not remotely operated.
Never you should have your information automatically fill in or saved. You never know
he could send a great gift to him passing through your wallet. :p

It's where the two step authentication comes in handy. I have steam on my phone for
Steam Guard, so if someone does unfortunately manage to get a hold of my details, they
won't be able to log in without the code generated from my phone.

I wonder if having set the "ExecutionPolicy" in PowerShell to "Restricted" would have
helped. Windows 10 brilliantly comes WFO in that regard. I'm not advising anyone to
do the same, but I ran "Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted" and left it that way.

What if I downloaded the installer on mobile but didn't run it?

Then you are fine. Malware cannot hurt you unless its executed in some way.
