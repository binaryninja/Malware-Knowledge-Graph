Cyber Espionage Tradecraft in the Real World
Adversaries targeting Taiwan and Japan in the second half of 2019

In trod u c tio n
This report is a public release of research that Macnica Networks and TeamT5 have conducted into the cyber espionage
groups targeting organizations in Taiwan and Japan.
It has been created to bring awareness to attack campaigns observed in the 2019 fiscal year (April 2019 to March 2020)
that were perpetrated in attempts to steal confidential information (personal identifiable information, policy-related
information, manufacturing data, etc.) from Japanese organizations.
Focusing mainly on cases involving use of high-stealth remote access trojans (RATs) observed in the second half of fiscal
2019, it describes new attack techniques and how such threats can be detected. Lists of the indicators used in the
various attack campaigns described within this report are provided at the end.

Targeted industries and trends of observed c yber attacks

Although the Tick and BlackTech have continued to be very active, as was observed in the preceding year, 1 analysis of
trends in cyber attacks in fiscal 2019 shows that the number of cyber espionage groups targeting Japan has decreased
in this fiscal year. Because of the increased activities of the DarkHotel targeting media in the first half of the year, the
overall number of attacks on media was high. In the second half of the year, activities of the BlackTech targeting IT
service company was observed. In the observations from the previous fiscal year, industry types targeted by the
BlackTech attack were predominantly manufacturing industries; however, in this fiscal year its attacks have been
wide-ranging, including research, critical infrastructure, IT services, and more, and analysis suggests that it may be
attempting to steal not only technical information from manufacturing industries, but also PII (Personal Identifiable
Information) and business intelligence. Moreover, two major electronics companies have announced that they
experienced targeted attacks around 2017 and 2018.2 3 4 According to public reports, a major electronics company was
infiltrated by the Chinese APTs Nian (A.K.A. Tick) and Huapi (A.K.A. BlackTech). Massive confidential information of the
company as well as its customers’ , including several government agencies and other companies from industries such as
electrical power, communications, railways, automotive, and more, were estimated to be affected. The initial intrusion
occurred at the company’s Chinese branch office. By exploiting the update function of anti-virus software used by the
office, the attacker was able to distribute malware and gain access to the company headquarters. Identified
vulnerabilities of the anti-virus product were CVE-2019-9489 and CVE-2019-18187, which allow modification of files and
remote code execution.

It was not until this year that this intrusion was revealed by the company, therefore, it was not included in the statistics of
our reports in 2018-2019. This incident has again highlighted the difficulty of detecting attacks and intrusion launched
by APT actors, meaning that the statistics of our report often show only the tip of the iceberg. We hope that the attack
techniques described herein will be a useful reference for cyber security team to defend against cyber espionage
operations.

T im elin e a nd su m ma r y of a t ta c k s
Cyber espionage group activities we identified in each month from April to March are shown in the table below.
Analysis shows that activities of the Tick and BlackTech decreased after September. On the other hand, these groups
continued to make attacks against organizations in which they had already gained a foothold before, and going into the
second half of the year, discoveries were made of activities of the Tick group against chemical industry organizations in
September and activities of the BlackTech attack group against IT service companies in February. Also, although they
have not yet been tied to any particular group, attacks were observed in December and January that used a RAT
(LODEINFO) that is similar in structure to the ANEL malware used in past attacks by the APT10 attack group.5

Table 1. 2019 Timeline

September 2019 (Chemical)
Attacks by the Tick group on the Chinese offices of Japanese chemical industry organization were observed. 6 The
malware used in these attacks left a pdb (C:\Users\jack\Desktop\test\version\Release\version.pdb), and from this
character string and function the malware was named “version RAT” .version RAT was developed to run only in a
Windows10 environment. It includes three remote-controlled functions: execution of a remote shell, file uploading, and
file downloading. Because it is designed to operate only in a specific OS environment, analysis suggests that it may
have been used after the Tick group first obtained some degree of knowledge about the targeted environment.

December 2019 (Media)
At the end of December 2019, spear phishing e-mail disguised as new year’s greetings was delivered to media
companies and other industries. The attached file was a Word document with an embedded macro which, when
activated, caused malware to be written into the disc and executed. This malware was DLL file. When it runs, it carries
out its operations by injecting malicious code into a svchost.exe process. It possesses an instruction set similar to Unix
commands and is known as LODEINFO malware. 7

Going into January 2020, spear phishing e-mail attacks were observed targeting defense-related organizations with an
Office macro file attachment designed to drop LODEINFO malware.

February 2020 (IT services)
We observed BlackTech’ s 32bit ELF malware which runs on Linux OS platform uploaded to public malware repository
and we assume the victim probably was IT service organization.
It has been noted that this malware is similar to TsCookie malware which is one of BlackTech’ s tools.8 We discovered
several other tools and are presented in this report.

New T TPs a nd R ATs
In this section we will present information, in some detail, focusing on observations and analyses not yet touched on by
the published reports previously cited.

Tick
Evolving Downloader
In September 2019, attack on Japanese company’ s office in China was observed. Analysis of the techniques (the
functions of the malware, the characteristics of the code level, the exploitation of the legitimate Websites as C2 servers)
and the targeted industry suggests that these attack was made by the Tick group. The malware used incorporated the
anti-virus product deactivation and encryption implementation seen in downloader malwares previously used by Tick,
and it seems that Tick has been carrying out continual update of their downloaders. A particularly significant
characteristic is the implementation of a remote shell feature. Previously, target verification with a downloader had been
carried out using the information automatically collected from an infected device. The collected information was
uploaded to external server. If the uploaded information fulfills the condition implemented in the server, next payload
would be delivered. This was the first time for us to observe that Tick implemented remote shell feature in its
downloader. This is thought to be used for gathering a greater amount of information to increase the precision of target
verification. Based on the remaining debug information file (pdb) name and functions, We named this malware “version
RAT” .

In this attack, we discovered that version RAT was installed on several devices. One characteristic was that C2 servers of
each RAT were different. This meant that even if the RAT was detected on a single device, only C2 server indicator
would not be enough to identify other infected devices, which was probably intended to extend the period of stay in
the target network as long as possible. Because the pdb path left in each RAT was different, it is considered that source
code sets were shared among several developers belonging to Tick group and tuning was carried out for the settings of
C&C, etc, in each operation. The pdb path of one sample contained Hangul characters. Because of this, and because
Tick also targets South Korean organizations, it is suspected that person well versed in the Korean language may be
employed as a developer of the group.

Table 2. Discovered Version RAT
This malware was in a DLL file format and had the same file name as the legitimate version.dll preinstalled in Windows.
When the malicious DLL file was installed in the folder containing the legitimate Fortigate EXE which loads version.dll,
the malicious DLL would be loaded instead of the version.dll in the System32 folder. (DLL Search Order Hijacking)
Using this technique, the malware would be automatically run and remain in the infected device even after the device
was rebooted.

DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique that has been used for a long time, and the fact that it is still being used by
numerous groups to this day indicates that it remains an effective technique for avoiding a number of security solutions
such as anti-virus products and whitelist protection.
Also, it uses a unique technique to identify the OS of the infected device.
The malware loads the legitimate version.dll in the System32 folder and verifies whether a particular API can be loaded.
The GetFileVersionInfoExA function is exported via the version.dll of Windows10, and cannot be loaded on any other
OS. In this way, this malware is prevented from running on any OS other than Windows 10. This technique is especially
effective to circumvent dynamic analysis and sandbox base security.

Characteristics of version RAT communications
C2 servers were exploited legitimate Websites and the protocol is HTTP. some User-Agent strings are embedded in the
malware, and picks up one of the strings based on the mshtml.dll version in the infected device (Table 3).

mshtml.dll Version

User agent string

Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0)

11

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Table 3. Fixed User Agent Strings (version RAT)
The communication data is encrypted by combining AES CBC mode (key and initialization vector [IV] generated using
two fixed character strings, '!@#$%^$$#$%^%$#@' and 'sdjfiejkflmvjfkd', and random values) and base64.
All of the C2 servers were compromised legitimate Websites in Japan. In terms of signature creation to detect C2 traffic,
although there do exist fixed URL parameters embedded in malware that could be used as detection conditions,
because they are frequently changed, it is considered difficult to achieve traffic detection using signatures soon after
malware has been used. Because of that, although it means taking delayed action, we recommend that when a
downloader C2 URL used by Tick is published by security vendors, etc, network logs should be examined using the
fixed URL pattern part as a detection condition.

Observed internal activity
After confirming communication with the target device via a ping command using the version RAT remote shell, the
attacker attempted lateral movement with a net use command.

net group “domain admins” /domain
ping -n 1 <hostname1>
net use \\<hostname1> [redacted] /u:<hostname1>\administrator

C2
A PHP file was installed on compromised Websites. The PHP file’ s code is only around 200 lines, without obfuscation,
and was designed to perform branch processing according to the URL parameters set by version RAT or attacker at the
time of access. This PHP code does not implement user interface and decryption processing of encrypted data. Its main
role is relay point of encrypted data between the attacker and the infected devices. Because of this, it is thought that
the user interface enabling the attacker to carry out operations was implemented on the attacker’ s operation device or
on another server. The attacker gained access to the compromised Web site via a servers set up on the platforms of
overseas VPS services. It is thought that the reason why the PHP code was made so simple was that the attacker
considered that if the code were obfuscated as with a WebShell, it would produce a lot of distinctive codes and would
increase the likelihood of being detected by anti-virus products. Data communication between the attacker and the C2
server is carried out via the same mechanism as for communications between the RAT and the C2 server (AES +
base64). Because the key and initialization vector (IV) are included in the communication data (Figure 7 and Figure 8),
decryption can be performed if the URL parameters and POST data remain in the log. IV and Data are split in 2 parts.
An exclamation mark (!) is attached to the end of the data transmitted to the RAT as an identifier to verify the validity of
the data.

down_new
In November 2019, two files considered to be Tick’ s downloaders were uploaded to the public malware repository.
The encryption method was the same as that of the version RAT, AES + base64, and the two character strings used to
create the key were the same. Rather than a DLL file, these malwares are EXE file which, when executed, copies itself to
a specified location and adds a log-on script registry as a persistence. automatically run when a user logs in to an
infected device.
These samples also had the distinctive pdb file path left in samples used by Tick.

A major difference between these two down_new samples and version RAT is that a remote shell function is not
implemented. Considering the fact that they have few functions compared with version RAT, the sample compilation
date and time, and passive DNS information, it is thought that these two down_new samples are version RAT
development bases and were used some time before August 2019.
User-Agent string set in HTTP header is fixed, as with the version RAT, but is decided which one is used according to the

ShadowPAD
In late 2019, while we were analyzing an attack from Tick, something interesting happened. After running the ABK
downloader9 found in that case, a ShadowPAD RAT, also known as POISONPLUG, was downloaded as its 2nd-stage
backdoor. Though ShadowPAD is a shared tool among Chinese APT groups, this is the first time we observed Tick using
it. As ABK downloader is widely regarded as Tick’ s exclusive tool, this phenomenon confirms that Tick also uses
ShadowPAD as their weapon.

The downloaded sample is a dropper, which drops a legitimate EXE file and a DLL named mscoree.dll containing the
ShadowPAD RAT. The DLL contains a “loader” module, five other functional modules, and a shellcode segment, all
encrypted with binary operations. These modules are DLLs with the PE header replaced with random data. The
shellcode is first used to reflectively inject the “loader” module into memory and then used by the “loader” module to
inject other modules. The shellcode itself is heavily obfuscated using fake instructions, making it difficult to analyze. In
addition to obfuscation, all the strings are encrypted and WinAPIs are dynamically linked either through hash or
encrypted strings, leaving an empty import table and no readable strings to analyze.

Figure 11. Obfuscation in the shellcode. On the left, the ‘E8’ byte cause the debugger to misinterpret
the code as CALL instructions. The image on the right shows the real code after removing the ‘E8’ bytes.

In this case, the five functional modules are the “main” module, the “registry” module that monitors registry changes, 2
C2 connection modules, and a module providing miscellaneous functions for other modules. Thanks to the modular
design, the threat actor can change the function provided by the ShadowPAD RAT by adding / replacing the modules.
The main module establishes persistence through registry key and inject itself along with other modules into a
svchost.exe process. Once inside the svchost.exe process, the main module will start the other module and connect to
the C2 server.

Figure 12. Modular structure of the ShadowPAD RAT sample. Different samples may contain different modules,
depending on the functionalities implemented by the actor.

The C2 server of this incident, 114.118.21[.]146, is an IP address located in Beijing, China. The traffic goes through port
443 but the actual contents are plaintext HTTP POST requests. Judging by the C2 module, the type of traffic may vary
between different ShadowPAD samples, as one of two the C2 modules contains functions for multiple connection
methods, while the other specifies the domain or IP address of the C2 server and which connection method it uses.

BlackTech
From the end of January 2020 through February, a Linux version of TsCookie malware and a series of attack tools
thought to be used by the BlackTech were discovered. In addition to the Linux version of TsCookie malware, the attack
tools included a WebShell, a port forwarding tool, a GoogleAPI token updater, a Linux version of Bifrose malware, and
more.
TsCookie Linux
As for the Linux version of TsCookie, although the functions and characteristics of the tool matched the published
information,10 the C2 server was different (Figure 13).

Bifrose Linux
A Linux version of Bifrose malware in the same category of RAT as TsCookie (sha256: 3cad20318f36b020cf4d6b44320e
b5a6dae0a78339a0fdc3a1fe5e280a8507f1, filename: sshd) was discovered. From the published information the Linux
version of Bifrose malware is thought to have been used by the BlackTech from around 2014, and the version used this
time was not much different from the version of that time, with configuration such as the C2 server being included in the
sample without any encryption (Figure 14).

Figure 14. Communication Destination and Port No. of the Linux Version of Bifrose

C2 server: The format of the initial beacon packet at the time of communication with 107.191.61[.]247:443 was as
shown below and was also the same as the referenced published information.
Format:<vitcim IP>|unix|<hostname>|<username>|5.0.0.0|0|1|1|0|<pid>|0|0|0|0|None|||||
Example: 172.16.108.141|unix|web1.localdomain|NULL|5.0.0.0|0|1|1|0|4789|0|0|0|0|None|||||
The communication data has the characteristic of encryption with an RC4 algorithm using the key
"\xA3\x78\x26\x35\x57\x32\x2D\x60\xB4\x3C\x2A\x5E\x33\x34\x72\x00".

Perl WebShell
In addition to the Linux version RAT, a WebShell was also discovered. The discovered WebShell file (sha256:
35f8dec25f11b8a1340d4a1e4c0bc55ed8d8560425d0d50ad6c002bc74f0fa6a) was a file that would operate on CGI-Perl
and was somewhat modified from the WebShell file published on GitHub. 12 The login password to access WebShell
was “www.org” , and remote shell execution and file uploading and downloading were supported.

Google API Token Updater
A Google API Token updater that runs on Linux platform was discovered, as heretofore. This file has a sem file name
and was compiled with Golang. It is compressed by the UPX packer, and because Golang’ s API static link creates a
large file size, it is possible that the UPX packer was used not for the purpose of avoiding detection of a normal packer,
but to reduce the file size. This file updates and saves the token required for Google API access.
(Usage example) $sem <token file path> <path of updated token file>

The following are used for the Google API client ID and secret key.
client_id=637778819557-clle39i9dlnpkq3i2kobmtl8dcnc4iv0.apps.googleusercontent.com&
client_secret=D2wmg1foukw6LIT7o2Ieg3rq&

It has been reported that the BlackTech used Google API to store stolen data on Google Drive Cloud. 13 If the Google
API Token updater tool that was discovered this time is part of a series of tools used by the BlackTech, it is likely that
they are using a separate tool for saving data on Google Drive and are using this tool for updating Google API Token.

The C2 server of the TsCookie discovered, fortigatecloud[.]com, appears to be related to the network infrastructure that
the BlackTech had used in the past (Figure 18).

Figure 18. BlackTech Infrastructure Relations

In this way, the BlackTech tends to reuse attack infrastructure in the past, and so using the indicators of the BlackTech for
network security devices can help to detect attacks in early stage. Moreover, because BlackTech has also breached
Linux server networks and uses a unique Linux version of TsCookie, host security measures should be implemented not
only for Windows, but also for Linux servers, and care should also be taken to carry out monitoring network traffic on
Linux servers.

LODEINFO
In late December 2019, spear phishing email was delivered to several companies in Japan. When a macro in the
attached doc file is activated, the system becomes infected with malware called LODEINFO.

Figure 19. Attack Flow Using LODEINFO

The macro embedded in the doc file is mainly obfuscated using base64. When the macro is decrypted,
base64-encoded data contained within a separate macro are acquired and the decoded data is saved as a file with
“.txt” extension. Although the file has “.txt” extension, it is DLL file and run using rundll32.exe. Values are added to the
Run registry so that it is automatically run after the device is rebooted.
While we analzyed some LODEINFO malwares, the following two values have been confirmed to be added to registries
for persistence.

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurentVersion\Run\"BIG_POOH" = cmd /c cd %ProgramData%&start
rundll32.exe Windows.SecurityMitigationsBroker.txt main

HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\"MsiWrapper" = cmd /c cd %ProgramData%&start
rundll32.exe euwPvlGQN.Ikbn main

Characteristics of LODEINFO
A pdb file path is left in the dropped DLL (LODEINFO).
E:\Production\Tool-Developing\png_info\Release\png_info.pdb
LODEINFO was developed based on the PNG file encoder/decoder “LodePNG” source code published on GitHub.14
This technique of trying to escape analysis by concealing a malicious code within the benign source code is often used
by attack groups based in Chinese-speaking regions.
There are two types of LODEINFO, one that injects a portable executable (PE) format RAT code into svchost.exe (Figure
20), and one that decrypts and executes a RAT code on the memory of a rundll32.exe (Figure21).

With the code-injection type, the attacker’ s code is added as a function to the end of the main function.

Adversaries targeting Taiwan and Japan in the second half of 2019

In the added malicious function, embedded payload is decrypted and svchost.exe is run and a PE format code is
injected into svchost.exe.
The payload is embedded in the data section and is decrypted by XORing with 128-bit values.
With the type that decrypts and runs the RAT code on the rundll32.exe memory, decryption and allocating RAT code on
the memory are implemented within the main function.

LODEINFO RAT Component
Finally, it is a code that runs on svchost.exe or rundll32.exe memory that has the RAT functions.
HTTP POST communication is regularly carried out to the C2 server and processing is performed according to the
instruction codes included in the response.
The instruction codes used such as “send” , “recv” , or “kill” , which suggests a UNIX OS environment (Figure 22).
When the attacker wants to put the RAT into a dormant state, a “stay calm!” code, which is not part of the RAT
command, was sent to the RAT (Figure 23). For the user agent, the fixed character string “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT
10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36” is used.

Communication data is encrypted by AES + base64. A characteristic point is that constants such as AES S-BOX are not
embedded in the data area, but rather, pushing the constant values into stack memory. The purpose of this is probably
to make it difficult to detect the encryption, and thereby hinder analysis.

Figure 24. AES Encryption

Similarities between APT10 and ANEL in code level
“ANEL” is one of the backdoor type malwares which APT10 used. Several similarities were found between LODEINFO
and ANEL in the code level. However, we don’t have enough information to corroborate attribution to a specific
adversary at the time of writing.

Code Similarities to ANEL
1. At the beginning of main processing, configured C2 servers string are parsed, and used in a single string variable.
2. Communication data (encryption + Base64)
CryptBinaryToString() is used for Base64 encoding of encrypted byte data.
3. A fixed User-Agent string is used for HTTP POST communication.
4. Encryption algorithms involving heavy implementation are coded without using encryption libraries.
5. C2 response is read by InternetReadFile() and instruction processing is run in another thread using CreateThread().
6. Version information is embedded in the RAT.

A bou t a t ta c k g rou ps
Summaries and characteristics of two cyber espionage groups observed to be active in the 2019 fiscal year are
described below.

Tick (Nian)

Nian’ s actors are applying new variants of their previous tools this year. We were all familiar with its favorite practices
including cpycat, 9002, etc. These are still in use, but in combination of the new members, Ravirra and ABK
Downloader.

Nian is one of the pioneers in supply chain attacks. The most famous incident attributed to Nian is the SKYSEA invasion
disclosed in 2016. The Nian actors still focus on NEA countries (Japan & South Korea) but turns to have a broader
industry preference. They are not only collecting intelligence from military and government but to private enterprises,
such as those in electronics and chemical industries.

BlackTech (Huapi)

The Huapi actors had focused in targeting Taiwan, including entities affiliated with Taiwan in other countries, for the first
ten years of their life span. However, Huapi has started to expand their targeting scope to include Japan since 2017. We
have observed several operations against Japan specifically since then. According to our observation, they have
infiltrated almost all kinds of important industries in Taiwan and Japan, including government, military, high tech,
education, telecommunication, and media.

The most remarkable capability of the Huapi actors might be their unique ability to find and exploit vulnerabilities in
antivirus or software asset management products. This kind of weapons made the Huapi actors quickly gain control over
the compromised host’ s network environment in post exploitation phase (after successful compromise).

Co nc lu sion
In 2019, Tick group and BlackTech were major players targeting Japan. While spear phishing is still a major attack
vector, exploiting vulnerabilities of internet-facing devices is becoming more popular among not only cybercrimes but
also state-sponsored espionage groups. Misusing legitimate services including Cloud platform and exploiting legitimate
Websites for C2 servers make more challenging to detect by traditional security solution.
More visualization by solution like EDR, NDR is important however analysis by internal and external experts is also
important to detect in early phase and minimize the impact. Cyber threat intelligence also can provide more context
and help our security life cycle.

Global organizations that have branch offices in overseas should be aware of that any branch offices are possible initial
intrusion point for targeted attacks. For example, Tick adversary looks initially gained access to China branch office and
then laterally moved to head quarter office in Japan. It is possible that targeted attacker thinks that it is easier to
compromise more vulnerable branch office first then move to head quarter via internal network than to directly
compromise head quarter. Especially global organizations that have attacked by targeted attacks, it is recommended to
do compromised assessment before connecting branch office’ s network to head quarter and it is important to discuss
security implementation with global team.

2020 became drastic changing year nobody had expected. We are urged to change and adjust our life and work style.
Cyber espionage groups don’ t stop during such this instable situation and are working hard to find more effective
attack vectors. We need to adjust ourselves in new environment and prepare against cyber attacks in new era.
