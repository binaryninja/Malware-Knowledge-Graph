This is a joint alert from the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States.

Introduction
The NCSC and CISA are investigating a strain of malware called QSnatch (also known
as ‘Derek’), which attackers used in late 2019 to target Network Attached Storage
(NAS) devices manufactured by the firm QNAP.
All QNAP NAS devices are potentially vulnerable to QSnatch malware if not updated
with the latest security fixes. The malware, documented in open-source reports,1 has
infected thousands of devices worldwide with a particularly high number of infections
in North America and Europe.2 Further, once a device has been infected, attackers
can prevent administrators from successfully running firmware updates.
This alert summarises the findings of NCSC,CISA and industry partner analysis and
provides mitigation advice.

Details
Campaigns
The NCSC and CISA have identified two campaigns of activity for QSnatch malware.
The first campaign likely began in early 2014 and continued until mid-2017, while the
second started in late 2018 and was still active in late 2019. The two campaigns are
distinguished by the initial payload used as well as some differences in capabilities.
This alert focuses on the second campaign as it is the most recent threat.
It is important to note that infrastructure used by the malicious cyber actors in both
campaigns is not currently active, but the threat remains to unpatched devices.
Although the identities and objectives of the malicious cyber actors using QSnatch are
currently unknown, the malware is relatively sophisticated, and the cyber actors
demonstrate an awareness of operational security.

Global distribution of infections
Analysis shows a significant number of infected devices. In mid-June 2020, there were
approximately 62,000 infected devices worldwide; of these, approximately 3,900 were
in the UK and 7,600 were in the US. Figure 1 below shows the location of these
devices in broad geographic terms.

Delivery and exploitation
The infection vector has not been identified, but QSnatch appears to be injected into
the device firmware during the infection stage, with the malicious code subsequently
run within the device, compromising it. The attacker then uses a domain generation
algorithm (DGA) to establish a command and control (C2) channel that periodically
generates multiple domain names for use in C2 communications, using the following
HTTP GET request:
HTTP GET https://[generated-address]/qnap_firmware.xml?=t[timestamp]3

Malware functionalities
Analysis shows that QSnatch malware contains multiple functionalities, such as:
•

•
•
•

3

CGI password logger
o This installs a fake version of the device admin login page, logging
successful authentications and passing them to the legitimate login
page.
Credential scraper
SSH backdoor
o This allows the cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on a device.
Exfiltration
o When run, QSnatch steals a predetermined list of files, which includes
system configurations and log files. These are encrypted with the actor’s
public key and sent to their infrastructure over HTTPS.

Webshell functionality for remote access

Persistence
The malware appears to gain persistence by preventing updates from installing on the
infected QNAP device. The attacker modifies the system host’s file, redirecting core
domain names used by the NAS to local out-of-date versions so updates can never
be installed.

Samples
The following tables provide hashes of related QSnatch samples found in open-source
malware repositories. File types fall into two buckets: (1) shell scripts (see table 1) and
(2) shell script compiler (SHC)-compiled executable and linking format (ELF) shell
scripts (see table 2). One notable point is that some samples intentionally patch the
infected QNAP for Samba remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2017-7494.

Mitigation
As stated above, once a device has been infected, attackers have been known to
make it impossible for administrators to successfully run the needed firmware updates.
This makes it extremely important for organisations to ensure their devices have not
been previously compromised. Organisations that are still running a vulnerable
version must run a full factory reset on the device prior to completing the
firmware upgrade to ensure the device is not left vulnerable.
The usual checks to ensure that the latest updates are installed still apply. To
prevent reinfection, this recommendation also applies to devices previously
infected with QSnatch but from which the malware has been removed.
To prevent QSnatch malware infections, the NCSC and CISA strongly recommend
that organisations take the recommended measures in QNAP’s November 2019
advisory.4
The NCSC and CISA also recommend organisations consider the following
mitigations:
•
•

Verify that you purchased QNAP devices from reputable sources.
Block external connections when the device is intended to be used strictly for
internal storage.
