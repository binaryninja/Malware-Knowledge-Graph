Summary
Description
This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North
Korean government - referred to by the U.S. Government as BANKSHOT. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the
North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov
/hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on
victim networks and to further network exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure
to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced
mitigation.
This report provides analysis of seven (7) malicious executable files. Five (5) of these files are proxy applications that all use a similar cipher
algorithm to mask traffic between the malware and the remote operator. Additionally, two of the five proxies have the ability to generate fake
TLS handshake sessions using valid public SSL certificates, disguising network connections with remote malicious actors. The remaining two
(2) executables are remote access tools (RATs), providing remote users with the ability to run various commands on an infected system. One
of these RATs uses a cipher and the OpenSSL library to add a layer of encryption to communications between the infected system and its
command and control (C2) server; this RAT may have been used to install the proxy servers onto compromised systems.
The following YARA signature can be used to detect the proxy servers and RATs:
rule Unauthorized_Proxy_Server_RAT

Description
This artifact is a malicious PE32 executable that allows a remote operator or a server to perform various remote operations. When executed,
the malware binds to the victim system and listens to activity on port 110. Static analysis of this application indicates that its primary purpose
is to force a compromised system to function as a proxy server for Internet connections. This capability enables an operator to securely
access the Internet through the compromised host. Data to and from the victim system is encoded to prevent identification of the proxy
sessions by firewalls or network analysis devices.
Analysis of the cipher algorithm indicates it uses a four-byte key. When the compromised system operating as a proxy server receives an
initial connection from the operator, it expects to receive the four-byte key. The malware accepts six additional bytes, which is decoded by
using the cipher and the previously received four bytes. The malware verifies the first four bytes received from the operator are between the
values 00123459h and 00123490h. If the first four bytes do not fall between these values, the malware terminates the session with the
operator. If the first four of these six bytes are between the specified values, the malware accepts the additional data. From the previous six
bytes of data, the fifth and sixth byte are used to make up a double word value, which is used to identify the size of the data the malware
expects to arrive next. If the double word value is larger than 1,000 bytes, the malware will terminate the connection. Analysis indicates this is
a safety mechanism built into the software to protect it from buffer or heap sprays.

Description
This artifact is a malicious Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) and is similar in design and functionality to the file
C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB. The primary difference is that this file is a Windows DLL instead of a Windows executable.
Static analysis indicates this application uses the OpenSSL library to add an additional layer of encryption over the traffic between the
operator and the proxy malware. The malware accepts four bytes of data, used as an argument to the Win32 API, setsockopt. When
executed, this proxy binds to the victim system and listens to activity on port 1030.

Description
This artifact is a malicious PE32 executable that allows a remote operator or a server to perform various remote operations. When executed,
the malware binds to the victim system and listens to port 1058. Static analysis of this application indicates that its primary purpose is to force
a compromised server to function as a proxy server for Internet connections.
This file is similar in design and functionality to the file C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB, but with the additional capability of
providing what appear to be proxied SSL encrypted sessions using public certificates from well-known, legitimate internet services. When
communicating with its C2, the malware attempts to disguise traffic by generating a false TLS handshake using a public certificate from one
of the sites listed below. Note: the malware does not communicate with any of the servers listed:

--End Strings of Interest-This malware uses a cipher and authentication method similar to that used by C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB for encrypting
network communication between itself and a remote operator.
The cipher and communication method, coupled with the malware's ability to create falsified TLS handshake traffic, allows the operator to
disguise network connections and obfuscate network traffic sent to and from a remote system.
See Figure 1 below for an illustration of the malware's communication flow using this proxy software.

Description
The artifact is a malicious Windows DLL application and was identified as a RAT, disguised as an installer for a generic security application.
When the file installs, the malware will expect the "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA = Security Packages” registry key to be
configured properly before loading the DLL onto the operating system as a security package. Analysis suggests an external loader
application was used to load this DLL.
The malware searches the system for configuration data by checking for the presence of the registry key "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Qnuimh =
DataPath". If the registry key is not found, the malware attempts to read a file named "system32\\msncf.dat" to access the configuration data.
If neither the registry key or .dat file are found, the malware's main thread does not execute.
Static analysis of the main thread reveals it is designed to provide C2 of the infected system to a remote operator. This file uses a cipher and
authentication method similar to that of files C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB and 114D8DB4843748D79861B49343C8B7CA.
The malware uses the OpenSSL library to provide an additional layer of SSL encryption to the communications between the operator and
malware. This SSL encryption is used in addition to the cipher. The RAT provides the ability to exfiltrate and upload files to and from the
compromised system and terminate processes. It also provides the ability to upload and execute secondary payloads. The OpenSSL library
and XOR cipher will protect the data uploaded and exfiltrated by the RAT. No hard coded C2s were found in the DLL. However, a common
Domain Generation Algorithm was identified, indicating the malware dynamically generates a domain from the current date and time.

Mitigation Recommendations
US-CERT would like to remind users and administrators of the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their
organization's systems:
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the
file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats; implement appropriate ACLs.
