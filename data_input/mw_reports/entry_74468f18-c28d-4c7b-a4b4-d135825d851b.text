What is PowerZure?
PowerZure is a PowerShell project created to assess and exploit resources within Microsoftâ€™s
cloud platform, Azure. PowerZure was created out of the need for a framework that can both
perform reconnaissance and exploitation of Azure, AzureAD, and the associated resources.

Requirements
The "Az" Azure PowerShell module is the primary module used in PowerZure, as it handles
most requests interacting with Azure resources. The Az module interacts using the Azure
REST API. It can be installed via PowerShell command Install-Module -Name Az
The AzureAD PowerShell Module is also used and is for handling AzureAD requests. The
AzureAD module uses the Microsoft Graph API and can be installed via the PowerShell
command Install-Module -Name AzureAD

If you have multiple subscriptions, you must set the main subscription with SetAzureSubscription . If you do not do this, things will fail.

Additional Resources
You can type Show-AzureCurrentUser to view the current signed-in user's roles in Azure
and Azure AD.
You can also type Get-AzureTargets to compare your current signed-in user's roles and
their scope to resources within Azure.
For target finding, I recommend using AzureHound, the Azure component to BloodHound.
