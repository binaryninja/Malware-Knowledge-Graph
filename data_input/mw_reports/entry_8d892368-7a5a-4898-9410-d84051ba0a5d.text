WHITE PAPER

Light in the Dark: Hunting for SUNBURST
In December 2020, FireEye revealed the details of a sophisticated threat actor that took
advantage of SolarWinds’ Orion Platform to orchestrate a wide-scale supply chain attack and
deploy a backdoor we call SUNBURST. This attack impacted organizations worldwide,
leading executives everywhere to question whether their environment fell victim.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is Sunburst?
This is a threat actor cluster that we are tracking, and the behavior is consistent with nationstate activity. The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous public and private
organizations around the world. They gained access to victims via trojanized updates to
SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring and management software.
What are the motivations of this actor?
2/5

UNC2452 main motivations are likely espionage by exfiltrating data. So far, no indicators of
extortion or financial crime have been discovered by the actor. Also, the actor leveraged
Sunburst malware (see below) and does not have any connotation to known ransomware.
What is the timeline of activity?
The campaign we have uncovered appears to have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is
currently ongoing. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor, and the operation was
conducted with significant operational security. Based on our analysis, the attacks that we
believe have been conducted as part of this campaign share certain common elements.
Who is responsible for this?
We were tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452, which references to an
“uncategorized”
group in our intel naming schema. In April 2022, we merged UNC2452 into APT29.
UNC2452 activity is now attributed to APT29.
Who was affected by this?
This is a global campaign that introduced a compromise into public and private
organizations; networks through the software supply chain. At this point in our investigation,
we have detected this activity in multiple entities worldwide. The victims have included
government, consulting, technology, healthcare, telecom, and oil and gas entities in North
America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. There may be additional victims in other
countries and verticals.
How did this affect FireEye?
Based on the latest findings from our investigation, we determined the SolarWinds
compromise was the original vector for the attack against FireEye. We believe that this is the
initial attack vector after which they used other sophisticated techniques to penetrate and
remain hidden in our network. Through the combination of our technology, intelligence, and
expertise, we uncovered the SUNBURST campaign.
Does this affect FireEye products?
No. We have already updated our products to detect the known altered SolarWinds binaries.
We are also scanning for any traces of activity by this actor and reaching out to customers if
we see potential indicators.
How was the intrusion detected?
The intrusion was detected by monitoring secondary registrations of our Two-Factor
authentication and reporting on suspicious behavior.
