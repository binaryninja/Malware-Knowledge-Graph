The Hitchhiker’s Guide to SolarWinds Incident Response
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/hitchhikers-guide-solarwinds-incident-response

On December 13, 2020, multiple security vendors in conjunction with CISA disclosed a
software supply-chain attack involving the SolarWinds Orion platform. The disclosure
detailed the activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) adversary that was able to gain
access to SolarWinds systems to create trojanized updates to the Orion platform between
March 2020 and possibly as recently as December 2020. The trojanized updates included a
custom, digitally signed backdoor called SUNBURST. SolarWinds Orion is a widely used
network infrastructure monitoring and management platform with a reported customer base
of over 18,000. The following versions may be affected:
Orion Platform 2019.4 HF5, version 2019.4.5200.9083
Orion Platform 2020.2 RC1, version 2020.2.100.12219
Orion Platform 2020.2 RC2, version 2020.2.5200.12394
Orion Platform 2020.2, 2020.2 HF1, version 2020.2.5300.12432
At this time, the full scope of the attack remains under investigation. What is known is that
the attack was executed by a truly sophisticated adversary with a deep understanding of
operational security and complex tradecraft. Based on publicly available data, this adversary
demonstrated significant efforts to evade, obfuscate, and clean-up using techniques such as
steganography, fingerprinting techniques to identify both target systems as well as analysis
systems, rotating infrastructure with a focus on geolocation proximity, as well as executing
code in memory as much as possible. These techniques, in combination with using a digitally
signed component of a trusted software platform as the initial infection vector, are indicative
of a highly skilled and covert adversary willing to expend resources to assure the success of
their operation.

Zscaler suggests that all organizations should take several immediate actions, described
below, in addition to reviewing the existing security policies and best practices available to
Zscaler customers.
These actions are recommended for any organization that may be impacted by the
SolarWinds event. They are not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all actions that an
organization may take, and each organization should perform its own due diligence to
assess impact and risk.

Investigation
Organizations should immediately identify all systems that may have SolarWinds Orion
installed. Once the systems are identified, the version should be checked against the list of
impacted versions. Depending on the result of the version(s) installed, additional responses
may be required. Even if a version is not found on the impacted version list, it may be
prudent to perform cursory checks to confirm there is no impact to the organization.
If an affected version of Orion is found, that system should be immediately taken offline and
all network traffic blocked inbound and outbound. Any system or user accounts associated
with the affected system should be disabled and reviewed for legitimacy as well as access. If
possible, a forensics image of the affected system should also be collected.
Network activity
Based on public reporting, a SolarWinds Orion system affected by this event—meaning that
the SUNBURST backdoor had been successfully installed—would begin network
communication to its first stage command and control (C&C) server at avsvmcloud[.]com.
While this activity does indicate that the affected system was within the target radius of the
attack, it does not confirm additional compromise or post-exploitation actions. Zscaler
Internet Access (ZIA) customers may be able to perform this search within the DNS Insights
or Web Insights area in the portal, or within the log aggregator/SIEM of choice where ZIA
logs are sent. This data will however be limited to systems that have their network traffic
routed to ZIA.
The following network indicators may be used to perform a sweep for a timeframe extending
back to March 2020 or further to discover possible compromised systems (note: additional
indicators may be discovered as additional data is disclosed).

All other internet-bound destinations from the Orion system should also be examined.
Additionally, all network activity originating from SolarWinds Orion systems to other internal
systems should be reviewed for potential lateral movement. This may prove challenging as
most Orion deployments likely allow it to have privileged access across the network to a
variety of systems. However, it may be possible to carve out a smaller set of data to initially
analyze by suppressing known-good or expected behaviors from the potentially affected
Orion system.
Endpoint
The SUNBURST backdoor is a digitally signed DLL file with a specific filename and hash.
The existence of this file on an Orion server is indicative that the adversary was able to gain
unauthorized access to the system. Additional post-exploitation behaviors may have been
performed by the adversary, indicating a successful intrusion. The following indicators and
behaviors may assist in confirming a compromise.
MD5 hashes

Behaviors
4/6

Modification of system tasks
delete-create-execute-delete-create directory action pattern
Newly created or unknown local user accounts
Existence or evidence of usage of Adfind.exe
Signs of cmd.exe or rundll32.exe spawned from solarwinds.businesslayerhost.exe
Existence of unknown and/or very broad email forwarding/deleting rules on the email
gateway
User account activity
Once SUNBURST has been deployed, the adversary will most likely begin to perform
reconnaissance actions using the privileges of the Orion system and explore what is
available in terms of additional assets to compromise or actions to take. The following
behaviors may have been observed on the affected Orion system or other systems that have
had communication with the affected system.
Anomalous logins or repeated failed authentication to internal systems
Logins from unknown or unrecognized external sources to internal systems
Extremely long duration tokens, which may indicate malicious activity (examine SAML
tokens for duration)

Zscaler was not impacted by this event. This may, however, be an opportunity for
organizations to reassess their security policies and confirm alignment with documented best
practices and recommended policies as described within our documentation, which covers
recommendations, such as:
