Cyberattack Impacts MTSA Facility Operations
The purpose of this bulletin is to inform the maritime community of a recent incident involving a
ransomware intrusion at a Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulated facility. Forensic
analysis is currently ongoing but the virus, identified as “Ryuk” ransomware, may have entered the
network of the MTSA facility via an email phishing campaign. Once the embedded malicious link in the
email was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant
enterprise Information Technology (IT) network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility’s access
to critical files. The virus further burrowed into the industrial control systems that monitor and control
cargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process operations. The impacts to the facility included a
disruption of the entire corporate IT network (beyond the footprint of the facility), disruption of camera
and physical access control systems, and loss of critical process control monitoring systems. These
combined effects required the company to shut down the primary operations of the facility for over 30
hours while a cyber-incident response was conducted.

At a minimum, the following measures may have prevented or limited the breach and decreased the time
for recovery:







Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems to monitor real-time network traffic
Industry standard and up to date virus detection software
Centralized and monitored host and server logging
Network segmentation to prevent IT systems from accessing the Operational Technology (OT)
environment
Up-to-date IT/OT network diagrams
Consistent backups of all critical files and software

The Coast Guard recommends facilities utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST Special Publication 800-82 when implementing a
Cyber Risk Management Program.
The Coast Guard urges maritime stakeholders to verify the validity of the email sender prior to
responding to or opening any unsolicited email messages. Additionally, facility owners and operators
should continue to evaluate their cybersecurity defense measures to reduce the effect of a cyber-attack.

As a reminder, suspicious activity and breaches of security, including breaches of telecommunications
equipment, including computer, system and network security measures which support functions
described in the facility security plan or could contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI),
must be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) at (800) 424-8802. For additional guidance on
the defining and reporting of cyber incidents refer to CG-5P Policy Letter 08-16, “Reporting Suspicious
Activity and Breaches of Security.”
The Coast Guard encourages companies and their facilities to remain vigilant in the identification and
prompt reporting of suspicious cyber-related activities. Questions pertaining to this bulletin may be
directed to the Coast Guard Office of Port & Facility Compliance’s Domestic Ports Division (CG-FAC1) at (202) 372-1109.
