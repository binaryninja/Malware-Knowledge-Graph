Although the “Ready to Ride” group originated in Russia it distributes Win32/Cycbot outside
the borders of the Russian Federation. Going by the prices per installation the primary
target of the group is the US.
My Russian colleagues Aleksandr Matrosov and Eugene Rodionov report that recently a
cybercrime group called “Ready to Ride” has attracted their attention, by distributing
malware of the Win32/Cycbot family. This group started in the fall last year, judging from the
domain name registration date – readytoride.su was registered on 8th September 2010.
Its primary activities were substitution (index hijacking) of search engine results (Google,
Bing, Yahoo) and clickjacking (hijacking the user's mouse-clicks and routing them invisibly
to another page).
(We've written previously about Win32/Glupteba
(https://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/03/02/tdl4-and-glubteba-piggyback-piggybugs), which
was another example of malware used to drive BlackHat SEO (Search Engine
Optimization).)
Although the “Ready to Ride” group originated in Russia it distributes Win32/Cycbot outside
the borders of the Russian Federation. Going by the price per installation (see Figure 1) the
primary target of the group is the US.

Figure 1
Win32/Cybot is distributed using a well-known PPI (Pay Per Install) scheme. To download
the malicious executable each partner uses the URL it has paid for, which generally looks
like this:
hxxp://1231.readytoride.su/adv.php?login=[partner_name]&key=[partner_key]&subacc=
[partner_id]

After the bot has been successfully activated
it submits its current status to the C&C
(Command and Control) server from which it
gets its instructions
(SEND_INSTALL_REPORT_TM):
id=[bot_id]&hwid=[hardware_id]&step=
[status]&wd=[win_ver]&av=[av_name]
While collecting information about the infected
system it determines what antivirus software
(if any) is being used by looking for a
corresponding process name. Here is the list
of AV software which is captured by the
malware:

The C&C URLs are hardcoded into the Win32/Cycbot
executable and are updated when a new version of
Win32/Cycbot is downloaded:

The bot is able to:
download executables
create new processes or new threads in an existing process
terminate processes and threads

check bot status in case one of the components was shut down
click on the references on a web page
inject JavaScript into web pages, substituting references and modify html
delete executables and downloaded files when instructed by the C&C server.
By means of injecting java script, diverting web searches, and modifying HTML code it is
able to pass itself off as a user surfing web pages, so as to counteract systems intended to
block clickjacking.
It is worth mentioning that the bot modifies the settings of the most popular browsers
(Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox). For instance, it modifies the file prefs.js used by the
Firefox web browser to contain browser settings and preferences. It adds information about
which proxy server to use. Similarly, it sets up a proxy using the HTTP protocol (127.0.0.1:
[port_number]) for other browsers.

Figure 4
The bot’s central component dispatches tasks received from the C&C server to other
components:

Figure 5
Win32/Cycbot is a multithreaded application and just a single instance of the bot can handle
dozens of tasks, clicking advertisements or poisoning web searches. Here is an example of
the bot’s network activity, captured over several minutes.
