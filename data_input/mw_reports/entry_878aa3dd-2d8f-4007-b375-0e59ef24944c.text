Many customers connect their private corporate networks to Microsoft 365 to benefit their
users, devices, and applications. However, there are many well-documented ways these
private networks can be compromised. As we have seen in recent events related to the
SolarWinds compromise, on-premises compromise can propagate to the cloud. Because
Microsoft 365 acts as the “nervous system” for many organizations, it is critical to protect it
from compromised on-premises infrastructure.
This document will show you how to configure your systems to protect your Microsoft 365
cloud environment from on-premises compromise. We primarily focus on Azure AD tenant
configuration settings, the ways Azure AD tenants can be safely connected to on-premises
systems, and the tradeoffs required to operate your systems in ways that protect your cloud
systems from on-premises compromise.
We strongly recommend you implement this guidance to secure your Microsoft 365 cloud
environment.

Understanding primary threat vectors from compromised onpremises environments
Your Microsoft 365 cloud environment benefits from an extensive monitoring and security
infrastructure. Using machine learning and human intelligence that looks across worldwide
traffic can rapidly detect attacks and allow you to reconfigure in near-real-time. In hybrid
deployments that connect on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft 365, many organizations
delegate trust to on-premises components for critical authentication and directory object
state management decisions. Unfortunately, if the on-premises environment is compromised,
these trust relationships result in attackers’ opportunities to compromise your Microsoft 365
environment.

The two primary threat vectors are federation trust relationships and account
synchronization. Both vectors can grant an attacker administrative access to your cloud.

1. Federated trust relationships, such as SAML authentication, are used to authenticate
to Microsoft 365 via your on-premises Identity Infrastructure. If a SAML token signing
certificate is compromised, federation would allow anyone with that certificate to
impersonate any user in your cloud
. We recommend you disable federation trust relationships for authentication to
Microsoft 365 when possible.

2. Account synchronization can be used to modify privileged users (including their
credentials) or groups granted administrative privileges in Microsoft 365. We
recommend you ensure that synchronized objects hold no privileges beyond a
userin Microsoft 365, either directly or via inclusion in trusted roles or groups. Ensure
these objects have no direct or nested assignment in trusted cloud roles or groups.

Principles for Protecting Microsoft 365 from on-premises
compromise
To address the threat vectors outlined above, we recommend you adhere to the principles
illustrated below:

2/11

1. Fully Isolate your Microsoft 365 administrator accounts. They should be
Mastered in Azure AD.
Authenticated with Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Secured by Azure AD conditional access.
Accessed only by using Azure Managed Workstations.
These are restricted use accounts. There should be no on-premises accounts with
administrative privileges in Microsoft 365. For more information see this overview of
Microsoft 365 administrator roles. Also see Roles for Microsoft 365 in Azure Active Directory.

1. Manage devices from Microsoft 365. Use Azure AD Join and cloud-based mobile
device management (MDM) to eliminate dependencies on your on-premises device
management infrastructure, which can compromise device and security controls.

3/11

2. No on-premises account has elevated privileges to Microsoft 365. Accounts
accessing on-premises applications that require NTLM, LDAP, or Kerberos
authentication need an account in the organization’s on-premises identity
infrastructure. Ensure that these accounts, including service accounts, are not included
in privileged cloud roles or groups and that changes to these accounts cannot impact
the integrity of your cloud environment. Privileged on-premises software must not be
capable of impacting Microsoft 365 privileged accounts or roles.

3. Use Azure AD cloud authentication to eliminate dependencies on your on-premises
credentials. Always use strong authentication, such as Windows Hello, FIDO, the
Microsoft Authenticator, or Azure AD MFA.

Specific Recommendations
The following sections provide specific guidance on how to implement the principles
described above.

Isolate privileged identities
In Azure AD, users with privileged roles such as administrators are the root of trust to build
and manage the rest of the environment. Implement the following practices to minimize the
impact of a compromise.

Use cloud-only accounts for Azure AD and Microsoft 365 privileged roles.
Deploy Azure Managed Workstations for privileged access to manage Microsoft 365
and Azure AD.
Deploy Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just in time (JIT) access to
all human accounts that have privileged roles, and require strong authentication to
activate roles.
Provide administrative roles the least privilege possible to perform their tasks.
To enable a richer role assignment experience that includes delegation and multiple
roles at the same time, consider using Azure AD security groups or Microsoft 365
Groups (collectively “cloud groups”) and enable role-based access control. You can
also use Administrative Units to restrict the scope of roles to a portion of the
organization.

4/11

Deploy Emergency Access Accounts and do NOT use on-premises password vaults to
store credentials.

For more information, see Securing privileged access, which has detailed guidance on this
topic. Also, see Secure access practices for administrators in Azure AD.

Use cloud authentication
Credentials are a primary attack vector. Implement the following practices to make
credentials more secure.

Deploy passwordless authentication: Reduce the use of passwords as much as
possible by deploying passwordless credentials. These credentials are managed and
validated natively in the cloud. Choose from:
Windows Hello for business
Authenticator App
FIDO2 security keys

Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication: Provision multiple strong credentials using Azure
AD MFA. That way, access to cloud resources will require a credential that is managed
in Azure AD in addition to an on-premises password that can be manipulated.
For more information, see Create a resilient access control management strategy
with Azure active Directory.

Limitations and tradeoffs
Hybrid account password management requires hybrid components such as password
protection agents and password writeback agents. If your on-premises infrastructure is
compromised, attackers can control the machines on which these agents reside. While
this will not compromise your cloud infrastructure, your cloud accounts will not protect
these components from on-premises compromise.

5/11

On-premises accounts synced from Active Directory are marked to never expire in
Azure AD, based on the assumption that on-premises AD password policies will
mitigate this. If your on-premises AD is compromised and synchronization from AD
connect needs to be disabled, you must set the option
EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers.

Provision User Access from the Cloud
Provisioning refers to the creation of user accounts and groups in applications or identity
providers.

Provision from cloud HR apps to Azure AD: This enables an on-premises
compromise to be isolated without disrupting your Joiner-Mover-Leaver cycle from your
cloud HR apps to Azure AD.
Cloud Applications: Where possible, deploy Azure AD App Provisioning as opposed
to on-premises provisioning solutions. This will protect some of your SaaS apps from
being poisoned with malicious user profiles due to on-premises breaches.

6/11

External Identities: Use Azure AD B2B collaboration. This will reduce the dependency
on on-premises accounts for external collaboration with partners, customers, and
suppliers. Carefully evaluate any direct federation with other identity providers. We
recommend limiting B2B guest accounts in the following ways.
Limit guest access to browsing groups and other properties in the directory.
Use the external collaboration settings to restrict guest ability to read groups
they are not members of.
Block access to the Azure portal. You can make rare necessary exceptions.
Create a Conditional Access policy that includes all guests and external
users and then implement a policy to block access.
Disconnected Forests: Use Azure AD Cloud Provisioning. This enables you to
connect to disconnected forests, eliminating the need to establish cross-forest
connectivity or trusts, which can broaden the impact of an on-premises breach.

Limitations and Tradeoffs:
When used to provision hybrid accounts, the Azure AD from cloud HR systems relies
on on-premises synchronization to complete the data flow from AD to Azure AD. If
synchronization is interrupted, new employee records will not be available in Azure AD.

Use cloud groups for collaboration and access
Cloud groups allow you to decouple your collaboration and access from your on-premises
infrastructure.

Collaboration: Use Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams for modern
collaboration. Decommission on-premises distribution lists, and Upgrade distribution
lists to Microsoft 365 Groups in Outlook.
Access: Use Azure AD security groups or Microsoft 365 Groups to authorize access to
applications in Azure AD.
Office 365 licensing: Use group-based licensing to provision to Office 365 using
cloud-only groups. This decouples control of group membership from on-premises
infrastructure.

Owners of groups used for access should be considered privileged identities to avoid
membership takeover from on-premises compromise. Take over includes direct manipulation
of group membership on-premises or manipulation of on-premises attributes that can affect
dynamic group membership in Microsoft 365.
7/11

Manage devices from the cloud
Use Azure AD capabilities to securely manage devices.

Use Windows 10 Workstations: Deploy Azure AD Joined devices with MDM policies.
Enable Windows Autopilot for a fully automated provisioning experience.
Deprecate Windows 8.1 and earlier machines.
Do not deploy Server OS machines as workstations.
Use Microsoft Intune as the source of authority of all device management
workloads.

Deploy Azure Managed Workstations for privileged access to manage Microsoft 365
and Azure AD.

Workloads, applications, and resources
On-premises SSO systems: Deprecate any on-premises federation and Web Access
Management infrastructure and configure applications to use Azure AD.
SaaS and LOB applications that support modern authentication protocols: Use
Azure AD for single sign-on. The more apps you configure to use Azure AD for
authentication, the less risk in the case of an on-premises compromise.
Legacy Applications
Authentication, authorization, and remote access to legacy applications that do
not support modern authentication can be enabled via Azure AD Application
Proxy. They can also be enabled through a network or application delivery
controller solution using secure hybrid access partner integrations.
Choose a VPN vendor that supports modern authentication and integrate its
authentication with Azure AD. In the case of an on-premises compromise, you
can use Azure AD to disable or block access by disabling the VPN.
Application and workload servers
Applications or resources that required servers can be migrated to Azure IaaS
and use Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) to decouple trust and
dependency on AD on-premises. To achieve this decoupling, virtual networks
used for Azure AD DS should not have connection to corporate networks.
Follow the guidance of the credential tiering. Application Servers are typically
considered Tier 1 assets.

8/11

Conditional Access Policies
Use Azure AD Conditional Access to interpret signals and make authentication decisions
based on them. For more information, see the Conditional Access deployment plan.
Legacy Authentication Protocols:Use Conditional Access to block legacy authentication
protocols whenever possible. Additionally, disable legacy authentication protocols at
the application level using application-specific configuration.
See specific details for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
Implement the recommended Identity and device access configurations.
If you are using a version of Azure AD that does not include Conditional Access,
ensure that you are using the Azure AD security defaults.
For more information on Azure AD feature licensing, see the Azure AD pricing
guide.

Monitoring
Once you have configured your environment to protect your Microsoft 365 from an onpremises compromise, proactively monitor the environment.

Scenarios to Monitor
Monitor the following key scenarios, in addition to any scenarios specific to your
organization. For example, you should proactively monitor access to your business-critical
applications and resources.
Suspicious activity: All Azure AD risk events should be monitored for suspicious
activity. Azure AD Identity Protection is natively integrated with Azure Security Center.
Define the network named locations to avoid noisy detections on location-based
signals.
User Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) alerts: Use UEBA to get insights on
anomaly detection.
Microsoft Cloud App Discovery (MCAS) provides UEBA in the cloud.
You can integrate on-prem UEBA from Azure ATP. MCAS reads signals from
Azure AD Identity Protection.

9/11

Emergency access accounts activity: Any access using emergency access
accounts should be monitored and alerts created for investigations. This monitoring
must include:
Sign-ins.
Credential management.
Any updates on group memberships.
Application Assignments.
Privileged role activity: Configure and review security alerts generated by Azure AD
PIM. Monitor direct assignment of privileged roles outside PIM by generating alerts
whenever a user is assigned directly.
Azure AD tenant-wide configurations: Any change to tenant-wide configurations
should generate alerts in the system. These include but are not limited to
Updating custom domains
Azure AD B2B allow/block list changes
Azure AD B2B allowed identity providers (SAML IDPs through direct federation or
social logins)
Conditional Access or Risk policy changes
Application and service principal objects:
New applications or service principals that might require Conditional Access
policies
Additional credentials added to service principals
Application consent activity
Custom roles:
Updates of the custom role definitions
New custom roles created

Log Management
Define a log storage and retention strategy, design, and implementation to facilitate a
consistent toolset such as SIEM systems like Azure Sentinel, common queries, and
investigation and forensics playbooks.
Azure AD Logs Ingest logs and signal produced following consistent best practices
(e.g., diagnostics settings, log retention, SIEM ingestion, etc.). The log strategy must
include the following Azure AD logs:
Sign-in activity
Audit logs
Risk events

10/11

Azure AD provides Azure Monitor integration for the sign-in activity log and audit logs. Risk
events can be ingested through Microsoft Graph API. You can stream Azure AD logs to
Azure monitor logs.

Hybrid Infrastructure OS Security Logs. All hybrid identity infrastructure OS logs
should be archived and carefully monitored as a Tier 0 system, given the surface area
implications. This includes:
Azure AD Connect. Azure AD Connect Health must be deployed to monitor
identity synchronization.
Application Proxy Agents
Password write-back agents
Password Protection Gateway machines
NPS that have the Azure MFA RADIUS extension
