ObliqueRAT returns with new campaign using hijacked
websites
blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/obliquerat-new-campaign.html

By Asheer Malhotra.
Cisco Talos has observed another malware campaign that utilizes malicious Microsoft
Office documents (maldocs) to spread the remote access trojan (RAT) ObliqueRAT.

1/17

This campaign targets organizations in South Asia.
ObliqueRAT has been linked to the Transparent Tribe APT group in the past.
This campaign hides the ObliqueRAT payload in seemingly benign image files hosted
on compromised websites.

What's new?
Cisco Talos recently discovered another new campaign distributing the malicious remote
access trojan (RAT) ObliqueRAT. In the past, Talos connected ObliqueRAT and another
campaign from December 2019 distributing CrimsonRAT. These two malware families share
similar maldocs and macros. This new campaign, however, utilizes completely different
macro code to download and deploy the ObliqueRAT payload. The attackers have also
updated the infection chain to deliver ObliqueRAT via adversary-controlled websites.

How did it work?
Historically, this RAT is dropped to a victim's endpoint using malicious Microsoft Office
documents (maldocs). These new maldocs, however, do not contain the ObliqueRAT
payload directly embedded in the maldoc, as observed in previous campaigns. Instead, the
attackers utilize a technique novel to their infection chain to infect targeted endpoints by
pointing users instead to malicious URLs. New core technical capabilities of ObliqueRAT
include:
The maldocs-based infection chain.
Changes/updates to its payload.
Additional links to previously observed malware attacks in the wild.

So what?
This new campaign is a typical example of how adversaries react to attack disclosures and
evolve their infection chains to evade detections. Modifications in the ObliqueRAT payloads
also highlight the usage of obfuscation techniques that can be used to evade traditional
signature-based detection mechanisms. While file-signature and network-based detection is
important, it can be complemented with system behavior analysis and endpoint protections
for additional layers of security.

Analysis of maldocs
The maldocs utilized in previous ObliqueRAT attacks used mechanisms identical to the
CrimsonRAT delivery maldocs. The latest campaign distributing ObliqueRAT now utilizes
completely different macro code in their maldocs.

The attack has also evolved to include the following functionalities:
Payloads are now hosted on compromised websites.
The payloads hosted on these websites consist of seemingly benign BMP image files.
The malicious macros download the images and the ObliqueRAT payload is extracted
to disk.
The ObliqueRAT payload is renamed with the .pif file extension.

ObliqueRAT payload extracted, written to file on disk and renamed.
Another instance of a maldoc uses a similar technique with the difference being that the
payload hosted on the compromised website is a BMP image containing a ZIP file that
contains ObliqueRAT payload. The malicious macros are responsible for extracting the ZIP
and subsequently the ObliqueRAT payload on the endpoint.
Persistence
The macros are also responsible for achieving reboot persistence for the ObliqueRAT
payloads. This is done by creating a shortcut (.url file extension) in the infected user's Startup
3/17

directory.

Malicious shortcut in the infected user's startup directory to execute ObliqueRAT on startup.

Image files
The image files used are BMP files hosted on adversary-controlled websites. The image files
contain legitimate image data and malicious executable bytes concealed in the image data
bytes.

ObliqueRAT payload
Talos discovered three new versions of ObliqueRAT as part of this investigation. This section
covers changes and updates introduced in these versions. For a complete technical analysis
of ObliqueRAT, refer to our previous blog post.
After the discovery of the previous ObliqueRAT payload (version 5.2) we observed four new
versions:
6.1, developed April 2020
6.3.2, developed September 2020
6.3.4, developed October 2020
6.3.5 developed November 2020

Version 6.1
The attackers made a few key updates with version 6.1:
5/17

Added a new command code "hb" to the RAT. Although this command code doesn't
really do anything, it is highly likely that the attackers are preparing to introduce a new
RAT capability.
The attackers introduced anti-infection checks in version 6.1. The implant does two
sets of checks:
Check for blocklisted usernames and computernames: The implant concatenates the
username and computer it acquires from the infected endpoint's environment variables.
This string is then checked against a list of blocklisted values to determine if the
implant should continue execution or exit out. See a full list of these keywords under
the IOC section.
Check for blocklisted process names: The following process names are blocklisted and
if found running on the system, the RAT implant will simply exit. The blocklist consists
of processes belonging to Virtual Machine software (such as VMWare) and analysis
tools (such as ProcessHacker etc.)
If any of the blocklisted strings match the artifacts on the endpoint, the implant stops
execution (without cleaning up its persistence mechanisms).

Version 6.3.2
This version adds new RAT capabilities to the implant. One of these consists of extracting
files of interest from hot-pluggable or removable drives connected to the endpoint.
Specifically, the implant looks for files with the following extensions in the removable drives:
doc, docx
pdf
ppt, pptx
txt
xls, xlsx
The implant will look for files with these extensions in the removable drive and the
"Recycled" folder. Any files found will be copied to its own file repository at locations
C:\ProgramData\System\Recycled (from <Drive_letter>:\Recycled) and
C:\ProgramData\System\Dump (from <Drive_Letter>:\*).
Another new ObliqueRAT capability involves recursively enumerating files in the drives
present on the endpoint. The file paths are all recorded to location
"C:\ProgramData\DirecTree.txt" (for the implant to later exfiltrate). The implant contains a
hard-coded list of drives to enumerate:
C:\, D:\, F:\, G:\, H:\, I:\, J:\, K:\, L:\, M:\, N:\, O:\, P:\, Q:\, R:\, S:\, T:\, U:\, V:\, W:\, X:\, Y:\, Z:\
There are also new capabilities triggered by specific command codes from the command and
control (C2) that were introduced in version 6.3.2:
6/17

Command code = "wes" ; Webcam screenshot
Capture current view of the webcam to a DIB file located at "C:\ProgramData\wsc".

7/17

Code to grab webcam frames and save to a DIB file.
Command code = "sss" ; Desktop Screenshot
Capture current screen (screenshot) and save screenshot as a JPEG to
"C:\ProgramData\tsc".
The contents of the file are subsequently read and sent to the C2.

8/17

Code to capture a screenshot as bitmap and save to file.
Command code = "pizz" Command Data=<filename> & <ZIP_file_name>
Similar to command code "4". Here, the implant accepts the names of the target file and an
archive file. The target file is added to the archive file created at "C:\ProgramData\
<archive_name>.zip". However, in this case, the archive file is not exfiltrated to the C2 and is
only created on the endpoint).
Command code = "plit" Command Data=<target filepath>
Receive a file path from the C2 for a file to read. The target file is read and then split into
smaller files named "<target_filename>.part_<part_number>" and stored on disk. This
capability can be used to break large files of interest into smaller chunks to prepare them for
exfiltration.

Version 6.3.4
This version contains minor changes to the ObliqueRAT implant including:
Removal of the "backed" command from the implant. This command was used to back
up the contents of one log file to another.
Addition of more anti-infection keywords to check on the endpoint (specifically for
Oracle VirtualBox VM detection).
Addition of the ".csv" file extension to targeted file types list copied over from
removable drives.
9/17

Version 6.3.5
The only update seen in this minor version update of ObliqueRAT is a change in the naming
convention of the Mutex created by the RAT.
The initial version of ObliqueRAT discovered in the wild by Talos created a mutex named
"Oblique" on the system. The attackers then changed their naming convention and
subsequent versions of ObliqueRAT discovered (and detailed in this post) follow a different
naming convention:
v6.1 :"t802" - Naming convention changed for mutex
v6.3.2 :"t803"
v6.3.4 :"t804"
v6.3.5 :"gaia5" - Another change in Mutex naming convention (possible randomization).

Related campaigns
Our previous post on ObliqueRAT detailed its connections to CrimsonRAT and,
subsequently, the links to the Transparent Tribe APT group targeting organizations in South
Asia. We have also observed overlaps in the C2 infrastructure used between ObliqueRAT
and a RevengeRAT campaign. Talos assesses with low confidence that there is a possible
link between certain RevengeRAT campaigns and ObliqueRAT and its operators.
RevengeRAT is a .NET-based RAT whose source code was leaked publicly a few years ago.
It has increasingly become a common practice for crimeware and state-sponsored groups to
utilize leaked malware. This practice takes away the need to develop implants and C2
servers from scratch and increases the chances of misattribution.

Conclusion
This campaign shows a threat actor evolving their infection techniques so that they no longer
resemble those used previously. It is highly likely that these changes are in response to
previous disclosures to achieve evasion for these new campaigns. The usage of
compromised websites is another attempt at detection evasion. The adversaries have also
introduced steganography as a way to hide the ObliqueRAT payloads in image files. This
technique is novel to ObliqueRAT's distribution chain (not observed in the past). This new
campaign distributing ObliqueRAT started in April 2020 and is still ongoing. This campaign
also highlights that while network-based detection is important, it must be complemented
with system behavior analysis and endpoint protections.
