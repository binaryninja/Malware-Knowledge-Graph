Full Disclosure of Havex Trojans
I did a talk on "SCADA Network Forensics" at the 4SICS conference last week, where I
disclosed the results from my analysis of the Havex RAT/backdoor.

The Havex backdoor is developed and used by a hacker group called Dragonfly, who
are also known as "Energetic Bear" and "Crouching Yeti". Dragonfly is an APT hacker
group, who have been reported to specifically target organizations in the energy
sector as well as companies in other ICS sectors such as industrial/machinery,
manufacturing and pharmaceutical.

In my 4SICS talk I disclosed a previously unpublished comprehensive view of ICS
software that has been trojanized with the Havex backdoor, complete with
screenshots, version numbers and checksums.

Dale Petersen, founder of Digital Bond, expressed the following request regarding the
lack of public information about the software trojanized with Havex:
If the names of the vendors that unwittingly spread Havex were made public,
the wide coverage would likely reach most of the affected asset owners.
Following Dale's request we decided to publish the information presented at 4SICS
also in this blog post, in order to reach as many affected asset owners as possible.
The information published here is based on our own sandbox executions of Havex
malware samples, which we have obtained via CodeAndSec and malwr.com. In
addition to what I presented at 4SICS, this blog post also includes new findings
published by Joel "scadahacker" Langill in version 2.0 of his Dragonfly white paper,
which was released just a couple of hours after my talk.
In Symantec's blog post about Havex they write:
Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was
inserted into the software bundles

Trojanized MESA Imaging driver
The first vendor known to have their software trojanized by the Dragonfly group was
the Swiss company MESA Imaging, who manufacture industrial grade cameras for
range measurements.

eWON / Talk2M
The second vendor to have their software trojanized was the Belgian company eWON,
who provide a remote maintenance service for industrial control systems called
“Talk2M”.

eWon published an incident report in January 2014 and then a follow-up report in July
2014 saying:
Back in January 2014, the eWON commercial web site www.ewon.biz had been
compromised. A corrupted eCatcherSetup.exe file had been uploaded into the
CMS (Content Management System) of www.ewon.biz web site. eCatcher
download hyperlinks were rerouted to this corrupted file. The corrupted
eCatcherSetup.exe contained a malware which could, under restricted
conditions, compromise the Talk2M login of the infected user.

Prior to version 2.0 of Joel's Dragonfly report, eCatcher was the only product from
eWON known to be infected with the Havex backdoor. However, Joel's report also
listed a product called “eGrabit”, which we managed to obtain a malware sample for
via malwr.com.

MB Connect Line
The most recent company known to have their software infected with the Havex
backdoor was the German company MB Connect Line GmbH, who are known for their
industrial router mbNET and VPN service mbCONNECT24.
MB Connect Line published a report about the Dragonfly intrusion in September 2014,
where they write:
On 16th of April 2014 our website www.mbconnectline.com has been attacked
by hackers. The files mbCHECK (Europe), VCOM_LAN2 and mbCONFTOOL have
been replaced with infected files. These files were available from 16th of April
2014 to 23th of April 2014 for download from our website. All of these files
were infected with the known Trojan Virus Havex Rat.

Notice how only mbCHECK for users in Europe was trojanized, there has been no
report of the USA/CAN version of mbCHECK being infected with Havex.
We have not been able to get hold of a malware sample for the trojanized version of
VCOM_LAN2. The screenshot below is therefore from a clean version of this software.

Conclusions on Havex Trojans
The vendors who have gotten their software trojanized by Dragonfly are all European
ICS companies (Switzerland, Belgium and Germany). Additionally, only the mbCHECK
version for users in Europe was infected with Havex, but not the one for US / Canada.
These facts indicate that the Dragonfly / Energetic Bear threat actor seems to primarily
target ICS companies in Europe.
