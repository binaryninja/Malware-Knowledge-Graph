Throughout 2022, AdvIntel observed 1,267,598 total Emotet infections worldwide. Significant
peaks in activity occurred between February/March, notably kicking off during the start of the
Russian-Ukrainian conflict at the end of February, and between June/July; attributed to
Emotet’s usage alongside post-Conti groups such as Quantum and BlackCat.

It is notable that the most Emotet-targeted country is the United States, making up 35.7% of
the dataset, with Finland (10.3%), Brazil (9.9%), The Netherlands (9.4%), and France (7.7%)
in the remaining top placements.

The Emotet botnet (also known as SpmTools) has fueled major cybercriminal groups as an
initial attack vector, or precursor, for numerous ongoing attacks. From November 2021 to
Conti’s dissolution in June 2022, Emotet was an exclusive Conti ransomware tool, however,
the Emotet infection chain is currently attributed to Quantum and BlackCat.
Emotet is a botnet of Eastern European origin that was originally designed as a banking
trojan, meant to steal sensitive banking information by intercepting internet traffic. However,
updates to Emotet over time have significantly increased the threat that it poses, and it has
evolved into a prominent, invasive malware loader, largely due to its ability to conduct a full
infection cycle and seamlessly spread other types of malware. Since its appearance in 2014,
Emotet has proved to be a consistent and highly threatening malware that has targeted
individuals, companies, municipalities, and governments alike.
The observed botnet taxonomy attacker flow for Emotet is Emotet -> Cobalt Strike ->
Ransomware Operation. What this means is that currently, the way that threat actors
primarily utilize Emotet is as a dropper, or downloader for a Cobalt Strike beacon, which
deploys a payload allowing threat actors to take over networks and execute ransomware
operations.

attacker flow, placed within a larger cluster of other “malware loader” and “backdoor”
software. Threat actors that were previously affiliated with the Conti group continue to utilize
its toolkit, which includes the Emotet botnet.

Emotet Patterns [MITRE ATT&CK Framework]:
The following techniques (framed within MITRE ATT&CK categorizations) are a small sample
of those utilized by Emotet (for a full list, click here).
Technique

Use

Account Discovery:
Email Account

Emotet may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and
accounts, or dump Exchange address lists such as global
address lists (GALs).

​ rute Force: Password
B
Guessing

​ ith no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the
W
system or environment, Emotet may guess passwords to attempt
access to the account.

Credentials from
Password Stores:
Credentials from Web
Browsers

​ motet may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading
E
files specific to the target browser.

Email Collection: Local
Email Collection

Emotet may target user email on local systems to collect
sensitive information.

Exfiltration Over C2
Channel

​ dversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing
A
command and control channel.

Process Injection:
Dynamic-link Library
Injection

Emotet may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in
order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
elevate privileges.

5/6

User Execution:
Malicious File

Emotet may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to
gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to
get them to open a file that will lead to code execution.
