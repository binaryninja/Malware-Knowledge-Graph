Another week, and another major mobile security risk. A few weeks ago, Zimperium zLabs
researchers disclosed unsecured cloud configurations exposing information in thousands of
legitimate iOS and Android apps (you can read more about it in our blog). This week, zLabs
is warning Android users about a sophisticated new malicious app.
The new malware disguises itself as a System Update application, and is stealing data,
messages, images and taking control of Android phones. Once in control, hackers can
record audio and phone calls, take photos, review browser history, access WhatsApp
messages, and more (a complete list is below).
The “System Update” app was identified by zLabs researchers who noticed an Android
application being detected by the z9 malware engine powering zIPS on-device detection.
Following an investigation, we discovered it to be a sophisticated spyware campaign with
complex capabilities. We also confirmed with Google that the app was not and has never
been on Google Play.
In this blog, we will:

Cover the capabilities of the spyware;
Discuss the techniques used to collect and store data; and
Show the communication with the C&C server to exfiltrate stolen data.

What can the malware do?
The mobile application poses a threat to Android devices by functioning as a Remote
Access Trojan (RAT) that receives and executes commands to collect and exfiltrate a wide
range of data and perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as:
Stealing instant messenger messages;
Stealing instant messenger database files (if root is available);
Inspecting the default browser’s bookmarks and searches;
Inspecting the bookmark and search history from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
and Samsung Internet Browser;
Searching for files with specific extensions (including .pdf, .doc, .docx, and .xls, .xlsx);
Inspecting the clipboard data;
Inspecting the content of the notifications;
Recording audio;
Recording phone calls;
Periodically take pictures (either through the front or back cameras);
Listing of the installed applications;
Stealing images and videos;
Monitoring the GPS location;
Stealing SMS messages;
Stealing phone contacts;
Stealing call logs;
Exfiltrating device information (e.g., installed applications, device name, storage
stats); and
Concealing its presence by hiding the icon from the device’s drawer/menu.

How does the malware work?
Upon installation (from a third party store, not Google Play Store), the device gets
registered with the Firebase Command and Control (C&C) with details such as the
presence or absence of WhatsApp, battery percentage, storage stats, the token received
from the Firebase messaging service, and the type of internet connection.
Options to update the mentioned device information exist as “update” and “refreshAllData,”
the difference being, in “update,” the device information alone is being collected and sent to
C&C, whereas in “refreshAllData,” a new Firebase token is also generated and exfiltrated.

The spyware’s functionality and data exfiltration are triggered under multiple conditions,
such as a new contact added, new SMS received or, a new application installed by making
use of Android’s contentObserver and Broadcast receivers.
Commands received through the Firebase messaging service initiate actions such as
recording of audio from the microphone and exfiltration of data such as SMS messages.
The Firebase communication is only used to issue the commands, and a dedicated C&C
server is used to collect the stolen data by using a POST request.

Figure 1: Code to parse and execute the commands from Firebase C&C (refer to IOCs)
The spyware is looking for any activity of interest, such as a phone call, to immediately
record the conversation, collect the updated call log, and then upload the contents to the
C&C server as an encrypted ZIP file. Determined to leave no traces of its malicious actions,
the spyware deletes the files as soon as it receives a “success” response from the C&C
server on successfully receiving the uploaded files.

Figure 2: Broadcast receiver declaration in AndroidManifest.xml
The collected data is organized into several folders inside the spyware’s private storage,
located at: “/data/data/com.update.system.important/files/files/system/FOLDER_NAME”
where the “FOLDER_NAME” is specified as shown in the following image.

Along with the command “re” for recording the audio from the microphone, the parameters
received are “from_time” and “to_time,” which is used to schedule an
OneTimeWorkRequest job to perform the intended malicious activity. Such usage of job
scheduling can be affected by battery optimizations applied on applications by the Android
OS, due to which, the spyware requests permission to ignore battery optimizations and
function unhindered.

Being very concerned about the freshness of the data, the spyware doesn’t use data
collected before a fixed period.
For example, location data is collected either from the GPS or the network (whichever is the
more recent) and if this most recent value is more than 5 minutes in the past, it decides to
collect and store the location data all over again. The same applies to photos taken using
the device’s camera, and the value is set to 40 minutes.

The spyware abuses the device’s Accessibility Services (gained from social engineering by
asking users to enable accessibility services) to collect conversations and message details
from WhatsApp by scraping the content on the screen after detecting the package name of
the top window matches WhatsApp (“com.whatsapp”). The collected data is stored within
an SQLite database with a model, as seen in the images below.

Figures 7: The database models for storing data from Whatsapp
In addition to collecting the messages using the Accessibility Services, if root access is
available, the spyware steals the WhatsApp database files by copying them from
WhatsApp’s private storage.

The spyware actively steals the clipboard data by registering clipboard listeners in just the
same way as it spies on SMS, GPS location, contacts, call logs, and notifications. The
listeners, observers, and broadcasted intents are used to trigger actions such as recording
a phone call and collecting the thumbnails of newly captured images/videos by the victim.

Figure 9: Code to steal data from the clipboard
The Android device’s storage is searched for files smaller than 30MB and having file
extensions from the list of “interesting” types (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx) to be
copied to the private directory of the application and encrypted as a folder before exfiltration
to the C&C server.

Figure 10: Code to search for files with specific extension and size less than 30MB
An aggressive capability of the spyware is to access and steal the contents cached and
stored in the external storage. In an attempt to not exfiltrate all the images/videos, which
can usually be quite large, the spyware steals the thumbnails which are much smaller in
size. This would also significantly reduce the bandwidth consumption and avoid showing
any sign of data exfiltration over the internet (assisting in evading detection). When the
victim is using Wi-Fi, all the stolen data from all the folders are sent to the C&C, whereas
when the victim is using a mobile data connection, only a specific set of data is sent to
C&C, as seen in Figure 12.

mobile data connection
Apart from the various types of personal data stolen from the victim, the spyware wants
more private data such as the victim’s bookmarks and search history from popular browsers
like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and the Samsung Internet Browser.

Figure 13: The content providers to query bookmarks and searches made by the victim
To identify the victim’s device name, the spyware tries to compare the information collected
from the device’s “Build.DEVICE” and “Build.MODEL” with a list of hardcoded values
amounting to a total of 112 device names such as seen below.

The spyware creates a notification if the device’s screen is off when it receives a command
using the Firebase messaging service, as shown in the below images. The “Searching for
update..” is not a legitimate notification from the operating system, but the spyware.

Figure 15, 16: The Fake notification and communication with the C&C server
The spyware is capable of performing a wide range of malicious activities to spy on the
victim while posing as a “System Update” application. It exhibits a rarely seen before
feature, stealing thumbnails of videos and images, in addition to the usage of a combination
of Firebase and a dedicated Command & Control server for receiving commands and
exfiltrate data.
