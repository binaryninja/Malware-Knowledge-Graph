Executive Summary
Palo Alto Networks is proactively trying to safeguard its customers from attacks however
possible. By leveraging its Next-Generation Firewall as sensors on the perimeter to detect
malicious payloads and attack patterns, Unit 42 researchers are able to hunt down the
menaces out there on the network, be they known or not.
Unit 42 researchers have taken a closer look at four Mirai variants from two recently
discovered campaigns leveraging command injection vulnerability exploits that reveal a
familiar IoT attack pattern.

While this generic approach allows researchers to observe the entire killchain and even
acquire the malware binary from the attack, this post-exploitation heuristic does have its
caveat: the traffic fingerprinting. Similar services yield similar traffic patterns because of
similar, if not identical, code bases and underlying implementation. Since a service can exist
in multiple devices with different configurations and there are multiple brands for a specific
device, it’s become exponentially hard, if not impossible, to identify the susceptible device(s)
in real time.
This blog includes a brief analysis of the two IoT exploits observed in the wild and the four
Mirai variants delivered during the attack. Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall
customers are protected against these attacks.

Exploit Payloads Include Mirai Variants
A total of four Mirai variants were recently discovered. Two new vulnerabilities were
leveraged as attack vectors to deliver Mirai. Upon successful exploitation, the wget utility is
invoked to download a shell script from the malware infrastructure. The shell script then
downloads several Mirai binaries compiled for different architectures and executes these
downloaded binaries one by one.
The first exploit, shown in Figure 1, targets a command injection vulnerability in a web
service with an NTP server setting feature. The service fails to sanitize the value of the HTTP
parameter NTP_SERVER, which in turn leads to arbitrary command execution.

Figure 1. Command injection exploit over the wire
Following the leads acquired from the attack traffic, we have narrowed our scope to some
IoT devices that are known to synchronize time through HTTP and found several vulnerable
NTP-server-handling routines in firmware in some IoT devices, which is concerning since
some vendors no longer support the products running said firmware. Figure 2 shows one
such vulnerable function found in a library module. While the firmware that we have analyzed
have such insecure functions, they are fortunately impervious to this specific attack because
the targeted uniform resource identifier (URI) is not present in these firmware. The
identification of the affected product is still in progress as we proceed to analyze other IoT
devices that are likely to do time synchronization through HTTP.

Figure 2. Vulnerable code snippet in one of the firmware
The initial attack incident of the first exploit was observed on July 23, 2020, at 05:55:06 a.m.
UTC. The attack (shown in Figure 1) lasted for a few weeks, with the last incident reported
on Sept. 23, 2020, at 15:21:23 p.m. UTC. There were 42 unique alerts at the time of this
writing.
The second exploit caught in the wild provides less context than the first exploit; the URL and
the HTTP request headers do not yield any useful insights. Evidently, there is a lack of
parameter sanitization in the HTTP parameter pid that results in a command injection
vulnerability, as shown in Figure 3. We speculate that the targeted service is some type of
remote process management tool because of similar parameter patterns in the attack traffic,
and that it’s possibly experimental and thus low in usage.

Figure 3. Command injection exploit over the wire.
A total of 48 unique attack incidents occurred in just 12 seconds. The attack started on Aug.
16, 2020, at 09:04:39 a.m. UTC, and it ended on Aug. 16, 2020, at 09:04:51 a.m. UTC,
indicating that this exploit is quick and short-lived.
We grouped the Mirai variants by numbers: one, two, three and four. The SHA256 for each
of the Mirai variants are available in the Indicators of Compromise section below. Table 1
shows the delivery method as well as the embedded decryption key for each variant.

While these variants do not share the exact same origin and configuration, they all possess
the necessary functionality to launch DDoS attacks. Variant four also possesses an infection
capability that is not present in the other three variants, making it a more dangerous threat.

Table 2 below summarizes the exploits that this particular Mirai variant uses for infecting
other vulnerable hosts. Just like its predecessors, this variant inherits exploits that were also
used in the previous variants.

Conclusion
Security for IoT devices is still concerning. One major challenge for IoT security is that IoT
devices that are no longer supported are still being deployed and used. Flaws in their
firmware unfortunately do not just go away with an end-of-life and end-of-support
announcement. The good news is that Palo Alto Networks offers the following products and
services to protect its customers from this kind of attacks, whether the threat is known or not:
Next-Generation Firewalls with Threat Prevention licenses can block the exploits and
C2 traffic with best practice configuration.
For tracking and protection purposes, the relevant coverage threat IDs are 59194 and
59083. Please update to the latest threat detection release.
WildFire can stop the malware with behavioral heuristics.
AutoFocus customers can track this activity with the Mirai tag.
The IoT Security subscription for the Next-Generation Firewall helps discover and
identify IoT devices on an organization’s network.
