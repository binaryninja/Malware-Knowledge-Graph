2021 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
SUMMARY
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) was coauthored by cybersecurity authorities of the United
States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom: the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
(CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NZ NCSC), and United Kingdom’s National
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK). This advisory provides details on the top 15 Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2021, as well as
other CVEs frequently exploited.
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities assess, in 2021,
malicious cyber actors aggressively targeted newly disclosed critical software vulnerabilities against
broad target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. To a lesser extent,
malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software vulnerabilities across a
broad spectrum of targets.
The cybersecurity authorities encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the
Mitigations section of this CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems and
implementing a centralized patch management system to reduce the risk of compromise by malicious
cyber actors.

U.S. organizations: all organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations
Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7
CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information
regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type
of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point
of contact. For NSA client requirements or general cybersecurity inquiries, contact
Cybersecurity_Requests@nsa.gov. Australian organizations: visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300
CYBER 1) to report cybersecurity incidents and access alerts and advisories. Canadian organizations: report
incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca. New Zealand organizations: report cyber security
incidents to incidents@ncsc.govt.nz or call 04 498 7654. United Kingdom organizations: report a significant
cyber security incident: ncsc.gov.uk/report-an-incident (monitored 24 hours) or, for urgent assistance, call 03000
200 973.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Key Findings
Globally, in 2021, malicious cyber actors targeted internet-facing systems, such as email servers and
virtual private network (VPN) servers, with exploits of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. For most of the
top exploited vulnerabilities, researchers or other actors released proof of concept (POC) code within
two weeks of the vulnerability’s disclosure, likely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of
malicious actors.
To a lesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software
vulnerabilities—some of which were also routinely exploited in 2020 or earlier. The exploitation of
older vulnerabilities demonstrates the continued risk to organizations that fail to patch software in a
timely manner or are using software that is no longer supported by a vendor.

Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
Table 1 shows the top 15 vulnerabilities U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK
cybersecurity authorities observed malicious actors routinely exploiting in 2021, which include:








CVE-2021-44228. This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apache’s Log4j library, an
open-source logging framework. An actor can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a
specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary
code. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control over the system. The actor can then
steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other malicious activity.[1] Log4j is
incorporated into thousands of products worldwide. This vulnerability was disclosed in
December 2021; the rapid widespread exploitation of this vulnerability demonstrates the ability
of malicious actors to quickly weaponize known vulnerabilities and target organizations before
they patch.
CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-27065. These
vulnerabilities, known as ProxyLogon, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful
exploitation of these vulnerabilities in combination (i.e., “vulnerability chaining”) allows an
unauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Exchange Servers, which,
in turn, enables the actor to gain persistent access to files and mailboxes on the servers, as
well as to credentials stored on the servers. Successful exploitation may additionally enable
the cyber actor to compromise trust and identity in a vulnerable network.
CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31207. These vulnerabilities, known as
ProxyShell, also affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful exploitation of these
vulnerabilities in combination enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code. These
vulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which typically runs on
port 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g., Microsoft’s web server). CAS is
commonly exposed to the internet to enable users to access their email via mobile devices
and web browsers.
CVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center,
could enable an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. This

vulnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited vulnerabilities after a POC
was released within a week of its disclosure. Attempted mass exploitation of this vulnerability
was observed in September 2021.
Three of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities were also routinely exploited in 2020: CVE2020-1472, CVE-2018-13379, and CVE-2019-11510. Their continued exploitation indicates that many
organizations fail to patch software in a timely manner and remain vulnerable to malicious cyber
actors.

MITIGATIONS
Vulnerability and Configuration Management





Update software, operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets in a
timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those CVEs
identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code
execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment. For patch information on CVEs
identified in this CSA, refer to the appendix.
o If a patch for a known exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied,
implement vendor-approved workarounds.
Use a centralized patch management system.
Replace end-of-life software, i.e., software that is no longer supported by the vendor. For
example, Accellion FTA was retired in April 2021.



Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing
systems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service providers
(CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs). Reputable MSPs can patch
applications—such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other employee
collaboration tools—for their customers. However, as MSPs and CSPs expand their client
organization's attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, organizations should
proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly reduce that risk. For more
information and guidance, see the following resources.
o CISA Insights Risk Considerations for Managed Service Provider Customers
o CISA Insights Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small- and Mid-sized
Businesses
o ACSC advice on How to Manage Your Security When Engaging a Managed Service
Provider

Identity and Access Management





Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception.
Enforce MFA on all VPN connections. If MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in
remote work to use strong passwords.
Regularly review, validate, or remove privileged accounts (annually at a minimum).
Configure access control under the concept of least privilege principle.
o Ensure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least privilege)
to perform intended functions (non-administrative privileges).

Note: see CISA Capacity Enhancement Guide – Implementing Strong Authentication and ACSC
guidance on Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for more information on hardening
authentication systems.

Protective Controls and Architecture


Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices, disable unused or
unnecessary network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused network
services and devices.
o Harden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link-Local Multicast
Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Common
Internet File System (CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP.
o Manage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts (e.g., KRBTGT) to minimize
Golden Ticket attacks and Kerberoasting.
o Strictly control the use of native scripting applications, such as command-line,
PowerShell, WinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Distributed
Component Object Model (DCOM).



Segment networks to limit or block lateral movement by controlling access to applications,
devices, and databases. Use private virtual local area networks.



Continuously monitor the attack surface and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate
lateral movement of a threat actor or malware.
o

o



Use security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security
information and event management (SIEM) tools. Consider using an information
technology asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure your EDR, SIEM,
vulnerability scanner etc., are reporting the same number of assets.
Monitor the environment for potentially unwanted programs.

Reduce third-party applications and unique system/application builds; provide exceptions only
if required to support business critical functions.
Implement application allowlisting.
