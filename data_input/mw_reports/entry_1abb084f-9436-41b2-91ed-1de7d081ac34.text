Exposing TAG-53’s Credential
Harvesting Infrastructure Used
for Russia-Aligned Espionage
Operations
CTA-RU-2022-1129

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
This report profiles the infrastructure used by the threat activity group TAG-53, which overlaps with
public reporting on Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The activity was identified through a
combination of Network Intelligence and analysis derived from open-source reporting. The report will
be of most interest to network defenders and individuals engaged in strategic and operational
intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian state in cyberspace.

Executive Summary
Beginning in July 2022, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed the recurring use of similar command
and control (C2) infrastructure by the threat activity group TAG-53. This newly discovered
infrastructure likely overlaps with other infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
previously attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM, who have been linked to activity
aligning with Russian state interests.
Insikt Group has observed the recurring use of common traits by TAG-53 when curating its
infrastructure, including the use of domain names employing a specific pattern construct along with
Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates, the use of a specific cluster of hosting providers, and the use of a small
cluster of autonomous systems.
TAG-53 infrastructure was found to contain a spoofed Microsoft login page masquerading as a
legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the United States, suggesting that some TAG-53
infrastructure has likely already been operationalized. Based on historical public reporting on
overlapping TAG-53 campaigns, it is likely that this credential harvesting activity is enabled in part
through phishing.

Key Judgments
●
●

●

Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure used by TAG-53, a group likely linked to suspected
Russian threat activity groups Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.
The identified TAG-53 infrastructure features common traits including the use of specific domain
registrars, the use of Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates, and a small cluster of autonomous systems.
Most of TAG-53’s domains use a specific stylistic structure.
TAG-53 has used domains masquerading as organizations across multiple industry verticals,
with a particular focus on government, intelligence, and military industries.

Background
TAG-53 is consistent when setting up its infrastructure, which bears significant hallmarks and crossover
with infrastructure attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The group continues to
use particular stylistic structures when registering malicious domains alongside the use of specific
domain registrars with IP addresses that reside in a small cluster of autonomous systems.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
On August 15, 2022, a Microsoft report published in collaboration with Google’s Threat Analysis Group
(TAG) and Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team detailed SEABORGIUM’s phishing operations. In this
research, Microsoft assesses that SEABORGIUM originates from Russia and has “objectives and
victimology that align closely with Russian state interests”. Microsoft denotes that SEABORGIUM shares
overlaps with Callisto Group, TA446, and COLDRIVER and indicates that the threat actor has carried out
persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns that have led to intrusions and data theft.
SEABORGIUM primarily focuses its targeting on NATO countries, including a specific emphasis on the
United States and the United Kingdom. The group also targeted Ukraine in the run-up to Russia’s
full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
Google’s TAG reported in March and updated in May 2022 that COLDRIVER has conducted credential
phishing campaigns using Gmail accounts targeting nongovernmental organizations and think tanks,
journalists, and government and defense officials. TAG also suggests that COLDRIVER’s TTPs have
evolved over time, moving towards incorporating PDF or DOC file links that are hosted on Google Drive
and Microsoft OneDrive within its phishing emails.

Threat and Technical Analysis
Insikt Group used intelligence provided in open-source reporting (1, 2, 3, 4) to profile TAG-53
infrastructure that likely overlaps with Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM infrastructure.
TAG-53 infrastructure was uncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain registrars,
autonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates. Based on this information,
it is highly likely that this threat group is continuing its phishing and credential-harvesting operations.
While monitoring TAG-53 infrastructure, Insikt Group observed a spoofed Microsoft login page
masquerading as a legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the US, suggesting that some
TAG-53 infrastructure has likely already been operationalized.

Registrars
Using both current and passive Domain Name System (DNS) records, Insikt Group resolved IP
addresses for 38 registered domains used by TAG-53 since January 2022. The identified TAG-53
domains, listed in Appendix A, have highlighted a trend towards the use of NameCheap, Porkbun,
REG.RU, and regway for domain registration that has persisted since mid-2022, a breakdown of which
can be seen in Figure 1. The reason for the preference of these registrars is unknown, but it is a useful
metric when profiling candidate TAG-53 infrastructure.

Autonomous Systems
Alongside the use of specific domain registrars is the use of particular autonomous systems, with all
domains collected under TAG-53 found to exist in 10 autonomous systems with a significant
concentration found located in 2 Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) linked to MIRhosting (AS52000)
and Hostwinds (AS54290) shown in Table 1 below.

Domain Name Structure
Most of the domains discovered via TAG-53 tracking use similarly structured domain names, primarily
made up of 2 terms separated by a hyphen, such as “cloud-safety[.]online”. Of the 38 domains
identified, 33 used the stylistic form “<word>-<word>.(com|online|ru)”. Of the remaining 5 domains, 4
were found to be similar, but consisted of 3 terms and 2 hyphens — “share-drive-ua[.]com”,
“network-storage-ltd[.]com”, “land-of-service[.]com”, and “nonviolent-conflict-service[.]com” — and 1
contained no hyphens — “proxycrioisolation[.]com”. However, additional factors enabled Insikt Group to
link these domains to the rest of TAG-53’s infrastructure.
A breakdown of the terms found in TAG-53 domains, shown in Figure 2, highlights the repeated use of
specific words within the domains, most of which are common, generic computing terms.

X.509 TLS Certificates
All identified TAG-53 domains were found to host corresponding X.509 TLS certificates provided by
Let’s Encrypt, an example of which is shown in Figure 3. The prevalent use of Let’s Encrypt TLS
certificates allows for further correlations between TAG-53 domains and infrastructure, strengthening
the clustering of this activity.

Targeting and Victimology
Of the 38 discovered domains, 9 contained references to potential target organizations or organizations
that TAG-53 may be attempting to masquerade as, shown in Table 2. The reason behind the use of
these themed domains is not fully understood beyond the likely attempt to emulate real entities in order
to appear more legitimate to potential targets and victims.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
Analysis of the 9 domains reveals that 7 share a focus around industry verticals that would likely be of
interest to Russia-nexus threat groups, especially in light of the war in Ukraine. The 2 outlier domains
are probably intended to masquerade as the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
(MVD)

Credential Harvesting
The TAG-53 domain “drive-globalordnance[.]com” includes a spoofed sign-in page for the legitimate
company Global Ordnance, a military weapons and hardware supplier in the US. The spoofed sign-in
page, shown in Figure 4, uses Global Ordnance branding and is suspected to be used for follow-on
credential harvesting after a target has been phished. It is unclear whether Global Ordnance is the
intended target of this attempted credential harvesting operation or whether TAG-53 is using a Global
Ordnance-styled domain and spoofed sign-in page to masquerade as a legitimate entity to target
victims.

network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in the
appendix.
Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server configurations and provides means to
block them in the Command and Control Security Control Feed. The Command and Control Feed
includes tools used by TAG-53 and other Russian state-sponsored threat activity groups.
Recorded Future clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to allow for detection and
remediation of active intrusions.
Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence
modules users can monitor real-time output from Network Intelligence analytics to identify
suspected targeted intrusion activity involving your organization or key vendors and partners.
Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains spoofing your organization, through the
Recorded Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails extension is available to any
customer that has a subscription to the Threat Intelligence or Brand Intelligence modules. The
LogoType source and alerting is exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does have
access to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.
Recorded Future’s Fraudulent Domains and Typosquats playbook explains triaging typosquatting
or similar domain alerts. If you have not yet set up your alerts, see activating certified alerts in
the Intelligence Goals Library.

Outlook
Insikt Group continues to track TAG-53 infrastructure and observe changes in TTPs as the group’s
credential harvesting operations diversify. Notably, a consistent trend has emerged regarding the use
of specifically tailored infrastructure by TAG-53 highlighting the long-term use of similar techniques for
their strategic campaigns.
Readers should detect, block, and hunt for the indicators referenced in connection with TAG-53
reporting via the Recorded Future Platform in network monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls,
and any associated perimeter security appliances.
