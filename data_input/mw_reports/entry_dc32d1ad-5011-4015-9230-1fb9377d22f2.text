StrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure

Overview
StrongPity, also known as Promethium, is a threat
group that is assumed to have been active since
at least 2012. Information about this actor was
first publicly reported in October 2016 with details
on attacks against users in Belgium and Italy.
Later, in 2018, the attackers shifted their focus on
another geographical region, compromising Turkish
telecommunication companies to target hundreds of
users in Turkey and Syria.
It is believed that the attacks attributed to StrongPity
are government-sponsored and are used for population
surveillance and intelligence exfiltration. More so, it is
believed that these attacks are used as support for the
geo-political conflicts in the region.
The known preferred infection vector used by the
StrongPity group is a watering hole technique,
delivering malicious versions of legitimate installers to
certain targets.
By closely monitoring this threat, Bitdefender has
managed to investigate it from several angles. Besides
the technical setups of command and control servers,
our researchers managed to get an insight into the
victims’ profile.
Most of the targets are located in two regions in
Turkey: in Istanbul and the area close to the Syrian
border.
The data we have gathered in the investigation into this
threat actor suggests that the attacker is interested
especially in the Kurdish community, placing this threat
in the geo-political context of the constant conflicts
between Turkey and the Kurdish community.

Key Findings:
•

Watering hole tactic that selectively targets victims
in Turkey and Syria using pre-defined IP list

•

3-tiered C&C infrastructure for covering tracks and
thwarting forensic investigation

•

Use of fully-working Trojanized popular tools,
compiled during working hours

Infrastructure
During the time we closely monitored this threat
actor and investigated different points from their
infrastructure, we were able to distinguish two types of
servers, used to fulfill two main roles:
•

Servers that will serve the poisoned installer used in
the initial compromise (referred from this point on
as Download Servers)

•

Servers used for exfiltrating information and for
interacting with the victim through commands
(referred from this point on as Command and
Control Servers)

Some particularities for each of these types will be
detailed below.

Download Servers
As mentioned before, one of the preferred infection
mechanisms is a watering hole technique. In this type
of attack, the threat actor will make use of certain
websites that the victim often visits. For what was
observed in the wild, StrongPity actors were able
to tamper some localized software aggregates and
sharers.
Usually, website visitors, when trying to download
a certain installer, are redirected to a dedicated
download server, as a result of a rewritten request
to the legitimate server. If a user is of interest to the
threat actor (his/her IP address is within one of the
ranges it targets), the server will return the tampered
version of that installer. Otherwise, the user will receive
the original version of it.
The servers where the targeted users are redirected
are referred as the download servers.

Trojanized installers
The malicious installers, which are served to the targeted victims, are quite interesting. The actor uses a custom
bundler/dropper, digitally signed (with a self-signed certificate), that embodies the malicious components and the
original, legit software product. But these initial droppers are very different, even if they are generated immediately one
from another. The encryption key for the components changes from one installer to other, although they tend to have
the same key length for each campaign.
During our investigation, we were able to gather several samples of these tampered installers. The affected
applications fall into several categories, such as application for compression like 7-zip and WinRAR archiver, security
software such as McAfee Security Scan Plus, file recovery application - Recuva, application for remote connection such
as TeamViewer, chat application such as WhatsApp or different tools and utilities like Piriform CCleaner, CleverFiles
Disk Drill, DAEMON Tools Lite, Glary Utilities, or RAR Password Unlocker, covering a wide range of needs.
Each initial dropper has a compile time, the exact date the tampered installer was created. When we investigated this
aspect, we observed that all the files we managed to retrieve were compiled from Monday to Friday, a normal work
week. Another interesting aspect is that the time interval for these timestamps is around 9 hours, which is a workday
norm. If we were to place this norm in a 9 to 6 working schedule the time zone would be UTC+2.

The above observation strengthens the idea that this threat is sponsored, and we are dealing with an organized
developer team paid to work for this “project”.

The download server
While monitoring the threat actor activity, we were able to investigate several points from the infrastructure.
The download servers had some interesting particularities.
The actor has taken some security measures in order to ensure that only the “right” connections are accepted.
They use a helper script (self-named “Debian Stretch Hardening Script”) with the following help message:
usage: $0 options
Debian Stretch Hardening Script
OPTIONS:
-u Admin User
-p SSH Port
-k SSH Public Key (example : “ssh-rsa AAA...”)
-d Domain Name
-n Knock Ports (example : 10001,10002,10003,10004)
--helpHelp
The script, among other actions, updates all the packages, creates the “admin user” on the system (and computes
the password for it, based on the Knock ports and SSH port), configures nginx and configures knockd service and the
firewall. Due to an error in the script, the password is always the same. This does not represent a problem because the
SSH daemon is configured to only allow public key authentication.
In one instance, the actor used a sequence of four Knock Ports when calling the script.
Interestingly, there seems to be a specific IP from Israel that is denied any connection to the download server, an IP
address which seems to belong to an important science university.
Reviewing the software logic, we identified 2 directories with malicious binary files and 3 PHP scripts:
1. configuration.php – contains the locations of those 2 directories and a list named $targets (which should contain a
list of IP ranges, but it is empty) and a mapping from 32 hex-digits to filename (which does not represent the md5
hash of the file, but uniquely identifies it- referenced from now on as file-id).
•

read.php – contains two functions:

•

checkUserIP() which checks if an IP address is contained in the $targets list

2. serveFile() – serve an installer file to the client
3. inject.php – the main logic. It Includes the other 2 php files, validates that the IP of the connecting client is among
the targets list defined in configuration.php, checks the file-id and serves the chosen file.
According to the logic of the scripts, one of the directories should contain the original installers and the other the
tampered ones. If the IP address of the victim is in the $targets list, a trojanized installer would be delivered, otherwise
a legitimate one would be served. In the case of the nodes we investigated, both directories contained the exact same
files and the $targets list was empty, meaning that any valid connection would get the malicious installer.
In the wild, we have seen the requests for the first layer of the following pattern:
5

Bitdefender Whitepaper
StrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure

https://<download server>/<8 character folder>/<the 32 hex-digits that identify the
file>
But, in the nodes that we have analyzed, a valid URL would have the form:
https://<download server>/<8 character folder>/<the inject.php file>?params=<the 32 hex
digits that identifies the file>.
This discrepancy points to either the nodes being out of use, or, the known URL scheme being changed.
Any other requests are redirected to https://google.com

Command and Control Servers
Once the malicious installer is downloaded and executed, the backdoor is installed. The backdoor will
communicate with a command and control server, embedded into its binary, for document exfiltration and
for retrieving commands to be executed, depending on the importance of the victim.
From an OPSEC point of view, the actor takes different actions in order to hide and anonymize its traces. The
C2 network uses a set of proxy servers to hide the terminal node/nodes in the infrastructure. At the moment
of writing, we have identified at least three layers in this infrastructure.

First layer
The first layer is made up of IPs to which the malware will try to connect. Each of these IPs has a unique domain
associated to it that is embedded in the binary. These are in fact proxies to other machines.
The nodes we have seen use the PHP curl bindings to forward the request to the next server in the chain they know
(one script for file exfiltration and one script for retrieving commands). If a node is compromised, one could not have
details about the entire infrastructure, knowing only about the nodes before it and the node it submits data to.
The first layer does some basic validation and forwards the traffic to and from another server, which usually is located
in a different country, at a different provider. The communication between the first layer and its upstream is HTTPS (the
certificate is not verified) on an unusual TCP port for this protocol – 1402.
As for the software stack, nginx and php are used and configured to respond with 404 to all incorrect requests (either
non-existing files, for which nginx serves the 404 response or for incorrect parameters to the PHP scripts, which falls
into the php script’s responsibility to serve the 404 code).

Second layer
The second layer is composed of the IP addresses that the first layer forwards data to. These IPs do not seem to have
any domains linked to them and have multiple first layer IPs pointing to them.
Other writeups mention the PHP scripts goN9Z2In7mYQmN92dzX11CQL.php (for file upload) and
p5Pss34GvX21pxO0bz25vLqU.php (for getting the commands). These PHP files still exist in the whole
infrastructure, but they now reside on the 2nd layer proxy, with the 1st layer/public facing script being named info.
phpor phpinfo.php (for file uploads) and ini.php or parse_ini_file.php (for the commands). The table below
illustrates the names of these PHP scripts our researchers retrieved during the investigation on each layer from the
infrastructure:

Both the first and second layers have the SSH daemon configured to listen on a high port (bigger than 1024). By
avoiding the use of the default port for a certain protocol, the threat actors are trying to ”stay under the radar” from
common Internet scanners and search engines like Shodan or Censys.
As far as our researchers were able to investigate, the threat actors use a VPN service for connecting and
administrating the servers , usually from secureconnect.me or torguardvpnaccess.com.
The figure below summarizes the communication between the proxy layers after an infection was performed:

In terms of infrastructure, we were able to map 47 servers with different functionalities. It does not seem that the threat
actor prefers a particular hosting provider or region to set up the infrastructure, but most of them are in Europe.

Components and Communication Protocol
Once the tampered installer is downloaded and executed, it will drop 4 files: the Legit Setup, the Launcher and
Persistence component, the Exfiltration and Command Execution component and the File Searcher component.
The first executed file is the original installer, which will be prompted to the user so that they would not suspect
anything. All malicious actions are performed in the background.
All of these 4 components are encrypted in the resource section of the initial dropper. Each resource has an 8-byte
header that tells the dropper the size of the executable and the component type.
A summary of the installation process is illustrated in the figure below:

After the Launcher component is dropped into the %SYSTEM% folder, it is executed by calling the function responsible
for creating a new service. The name of the service is a common one, either replacing a non-vital system service
(Print Spooler) or having a name that does not raise any suspicions (Registry Maintenance Server). The
service will be used as a persistence mechanism and will execute the Launcher component.
The dropper starts the service and will drop the rest of the executables.
The Launcher component executes the Exfiltration and Command Execution component, usually placed in the same
system folder, and waits for an uninstall event.
The Exfiltration component is responsible for running the File Searcher component and for exfiltrating the files to the
C&C server through a POST request. It regularly asks the C&C server for download and execution commands or an
uninstall command. The last one, if received, will be sent as an event to the Launcher component. The get_command is
sent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag. This tag is used as a form of authentication
and is influenced by the compilation time of the file. In our tests, the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if
asked for a command.
The File Searcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions. The malicious binary
has an extension list embedded (usually identifying different types of documents). If a file with an extension from that
list is found, it will be copied into a temporary zip archive. After completing adding the files to the archive, it will split it
8

Bitdefender Whitepaper
StrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure

into hidden .sft encrypted files. The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component, sent to the C&C server and deleted
from the disk.
After the exfiltration process is completed, the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described
above.
As mentioned earlier, the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file. This zip file will be encrypted into
multiple .sft files as follows:
•

The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file

•

For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it
will write the result in the .sft file

•

The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times

•

If the zip file still has unprocessed data, a new .sft file will be created

•

For each zip file, the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character, the rest of the .sft files which complete
an archive will have an O prepended.

Victims
While screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one. The majority of victims are
concentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria.
Zooming in, we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria, as
well as in Istanbul, enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo-political conflict between Turkey and
the Kurdish community.

A trade of brilliance, data security is an industry where only the clearest view, sharpest mind and deepest insight can
win — a game with zero margin of error. Our job is to win every single time, one thousand times out of one thousand,
and one million times out of one million.
And we do. We outsmart the industry not only by having the clearest view, the sharpest mind and the deepest insight,
but by staying one step ahead of everybody else, be they black hats or fellow security experts. The brilliance of our
collective mind is like a luminous Dragon-Wolf on your side, powered by engineered intuition, created to guard against
all dangers hidden in the arcane intricacies of the digital realm.
This brilliance is our superpower and we put it at the core of all our game-changing products and solutions.
