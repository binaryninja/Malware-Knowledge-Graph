SPM55: Ascending the Ranks of Indonesian Phishing As
A Service Offerings

Who is SPM55?
Although SPM55 is a relative newcomer to the Indonesian cybercrime community, a marked
uptick in activity and known customers over the last several months suggests this group
seeks to scale their business operation, possibly in response to the collapse of competing
Indonesia-based phishing vendors.
SPM55 offerings target a number of popular services, technology companies, and financial
institutions. Some examples include Coinbase, Netflix, Amazon, and Ebay. Another
noteworthy characteristic of SPM55 is their willingness to pivot rapidly based on customer
feedback and expand their customer base by releasing new phishing kits quickly. Further,
SPM55 offers a la carte credit card checkers and account validators which are frequently
used for phished credential and payment data validation. Another add-on is an “antibot”
service which SPM55 resells. In this context, such service reduces automated detection
rates and thwarts security vendors by identifying and redirecting sessions to innocuous
websites if a session appears to be inauthentic–that is, a session not belonging to a valid
phishing target.

SPM55 phishing pages and custom lures appear to focus on the typical “your account is
disabled” types of phishing page, and support not only fields for account credentials, but
also what is commonly known in cybercrime communities as “fullz” or “full personal
information” which can be used to commit several types of fraud.
Written in PHP and bearing a strong resemblance to–and at times outright copying–those
offered by cracked versions of 16Shop and Young Sister, SPM55’s phishing kits and
management panel are of above-average quality and have higher than average success
rates compared to other phishing kits. Based on customer preference, deployed and
properly licensed phishing kits send victim data to operators via email or Telegram. Notably,
credential processing appears to send victim information to a SPM55-controlled
management server as well, likely providing SPM55 with copies of the credentials stolen by
their customers. Siphoned data is likely sold or used for fraudulent purposes by SPM55
administrators. In short, SPM55 may scam their own customers. Because stolen credentials
and personal information are also likely siphoned to SPM55 administrators, the risk of harm
from such phishing activity at the hands of a competent cybercriminal is likely to be severe.

Behind SPM55
SPM55 operates out of Indonesia and its owner-admin uses the handle “AlexID” (among
others). While AlexID is not the only SPM55 administrator, they appear to run the
organization, as suggested by some of the earliest posts advertising the service which list
them as the owner of SPM55 as well as developer comments addressed to “Alex”
proposing how to approach technical questions.

Increasingly suspicious of outsiders, this group is somewhat hesitant to do business with
non-Indonesian speakers, much like how Russian cybercrime groups use idiomatic
language as a kind of screening mechanism for prospective customers. SPM55 prefers
payments using two Indonesian payments services, OVO and DANA, though they also
accept Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even with this seemingly cautious approach to onboarding

clients, the kits have found a receptive market and intelligence suggests customer accounts
number in the several hundreds of active users with a sharp recent uptick in new
customers.

Infrastructure Associated With SPM55 and Actors
While some infrastructure associated with SPM55 is hosted in Indonesia, the client base
cuts a wide swath across the globe with customers identified across in Nigeria, Pakistan,
and other geographies also historically associated with phishing activity. In keeping with
many such actors, there is a mix of both conventional domains registered for phishing
attacks, as well as a strong reliance on dynamic DNS providers, given the ease with which
such domains can be provisioned and the relatively lower cost and effort associated with
abusing such services. We have included a set of IOCs related to SPM55 campaigns which
highlight these and given the rate of recidivism of many SPM55 actors, pivots within
registration information and passive DNS using Iris Investigate shows an even broader
array of activity related to such actors.
Phishing remains to be the most common vector for account takeover and account fraud
activity for many large organizations, contributing to significant financial losses as well as
damage to brands as customers feel the impact of being victimized by these criminal
services. Given their prevalence, continued evolution, and nexus of activity in the phishingas-a-service marketspace, SPM55 is a criminal service worth keeping an eye on to help
defend organizations and their customers against.

Recommendations
For companies and brands impacted by these phishing kits, monitoring for lookalike
domains through solutions like DomainTools Detect can be an effective way of identifying
and disrupting campaign infrastructure. The same applies to companies and brands that
may become targets of this group in the future, given their frequent targeting pivots based
on customer demand.

Use of passive DNS data is also helpful in identifying other domains used by actors to
conduct this activity, including historical activity that may not have been previously observed
to determine the rate of recidivism against a brand.
Submitting offending domains to Google Safe Browsing and other similar services can help
prevent user and customer account fraud from compromised credentials.
