The footprints of Raccoon: a story about operators of JS-sniffer FakeSecurity distributing Raccoon stealer

Nikita Rostovcev
Threat Intelligence & Attribution analyst at Group-IB

Introduction
In the summer of 2020, Group-IB specialists discovered a malware distribution campaign
exploiting Telegram's legitimate features. Analysis showed that the attackers used the
technique to distribute Raccoon stealer, i.e. malware spread through the Malware-as-aService model on one of darknet forums. They, in particular, used Telegram channels in
order to bypass blocking of active C&C servers.
Raccoon Stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill
form details from browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc.). What's more,
Raccoon Stealer scans the infected device for information about valid crypto wallets. If
successful, it gains access to configuration files.

During research, Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution experts established links with
other elements of the threat actors' infrastructure and recreated the malicious campaign
timeline. The campaign was divided into four stages based on the tools used (type of
malware, registrars for creating infrastructure, etc.):
● First wave: February 19 to March 5 2020
● Second wave: March 13 to May 22, 2020
● Third wave: June 29 to July 2, 2020
● Fourth wave: August 24 to September 12, 2020
Most domains related to the investigated campaign were registered with two registrars:
Cloud2m and Host Africa. Cloud2m was used in earlier attacks. In mid-July 2020, some
of these domains moved to Host Africa.

Timeline of
FakeSecurity's
malicious campaign
from February to
September 2020

Group-IB experts concluded that the purpose of the campaign in question was to steal
payment and user data. The attackers used several attack vectors and tools to deliver the
malware.
It was also discovered that in early 2020, before distributing the Raccoon stealer, the
attackers had distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar. To do so, they used
attachments with malicious macros and phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus
phishing kit.

Infection pattern in the
malicious campaigns of
hacker group
FakeSecurity

This malware distribution technique reminded Group-IB experts of the pattern used by
FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators during the campaign described in November 2019.
Apart from having similar toolkits, both series of attacks targeted e-commerce. In May
2020, Group-IB identified online stores that had been infected with a modified JS-sniffer of
the FakeSecurity family. The JS-sniffer was obfuscated using the aaencode algorithm,
while the domains used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data were
registered during the second wave with the same registrars as the domains that we
discovered while investigating the malicious campaign. As such, it can be assumed that
FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators were behind the stealer distribution campaign.

First wave
The first wave of domain registrations began in the co.za zone on February 19, 2020. The
suspicious domains contained the following keywords: cloud, document, and Microsoft.
Examples of domains registered during the first wave are presented below:

msupdater[.]co.za

2020-02-19

documents-cloud-server[.]co.za

2020-03-05

cloudupdate[.]co.za

2020-02-21

As part of the campaign's first wave, the initial compromise vector used: (i) mailings with
attachments containing malicious macros and (ii) phishing pages leading to malware
downloading.

On February 28, nine days after the first domain was registered, the file "Bank001.xlsm"
(SHA1: b1799345152f0f11a0a573b91093a1867d64e119) was uploaded to VirusTotal via a

requests they make to download libraries and open source data, the file
"msofficeupdate.exe" and others like it are samples of the Vidar stealer. Criminals use the
stealer to collect data from browsers (including web browsing history and account data),
bank card data, crypto wallet files, messages, and more.

Mephistophilus phishing kit
The second attack vector during the first wave was the use of phishing pages to distribute
malware.
It turned out that the discovered domains (msupdater[.]co.za, cloudupdate[.]co.za and
documents-cloud-server[.]co.za) had the same A record created at the same time:
160.119.253[.]53. According to Group-IB's Graph Network Analysis, documents-cloudserver[.]co.za contained the Mephistophilus phishing kit.

Among these network requests, there is a connection to the blintick Telegram channel.
Telegram was used by Raccoon's creators to bypass blocking of the C&C servers. To this
end, the stealer makes a request to the Telegram channel and receives the encrypted
address of the new C&C server from the description. The first samples using this
technique began appearing on VirusTotal in late May 2020.

The lure documents used as part of this wave look identical to the previous ones. Judging
by their behavior after macros are activated, they were created by the same builder. Such
builders make it possible to create office documents with malicious macros based on
templates, which helps attackers distribute malicious files much faster and more efficiently.

http://cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi because the original
domain is blocked. It seems that the sample was trying to download RAT AveMaria as
before. In addition, all files related to this campaign made various network requests,

The fact that the cybercriminals additionally use loaders in their campaigns could indicate
that they are still searching for the most effective tools.

Fourth wave
Some of the domains registered in early September 2020 mimicked Adobe in their names.
From September 14, 2020, Group-IB experts found Mephistophilus with an identical
pattern on these hosts, just like during the first wave.

Relation to FakeSecurity
This malicious campaign bears a striking resemblance to a series of FakeSecurity JSsniffer attacks described by Group-IB in November 2019. Past attacks targeted owners of
online stores powered by Magento CMS. In the campaign described previously, the
attackers also used such tools as the Vidar stealer and the Mephistophilus phishing kit,
with an identical template for Adobe updates. In addition, the attackers used the same
hosting service to register domains in both campaigns.
In the 2020 campaign, the same attack vector was used and involved subsequent

distribution of the Raccoon stealer. In addition, the investigation revealed messages sent to
several online stores from bezco.quise1988@wp.pl and outtia.lene1985@wp.pl.
A detailed analysis of the first-wave malware distribution via Mephistophilus phishing
pages revealed a link between the domains involved in this campaign (in particular
documents-cloud-server*[.]co.za) and the FakeSecurity campaign. During the 2020
campaign, phishing pages were available at the following URLs:

List of domains with an
identical structure

According to urlscan[.]io, more than 20 sites with a similar structure were discovered, but
the one that stands out is alloaypparel[.]com. It was used in the FakeSecurity campaign.
Since March 2020, Group-IB specialists have started detecting online store infections with
a JS sniffer obfuscated by the aaencode algorithm (https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html).
The malware was loaded from get-js[.]com. WHOIS records similar to those used
previously by this group were located at get-js[.]com:
● fiswedbesign[.]com
● alloaypparel[.]com
● firstofbanks[.]com
● magento-security[.]org
● mage-security[.]org

After deobfuscating it, Group-IB established that the malware used for infections was a
modified version of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer. Its distribution was analyzed in November
2019.

Deobfuscated code of
the FakeSecurity JSsniffer modified version

In May 2020, Group-IB discovered new infected online stores. Once again, the attackers
used a modified FakeSecurity JS-sniffer obfuscated with aaencode. The malware was
injected either by a link using a script tag or by modifying existing JavaScript files on the

site. The JS-sniffer was used to compromise over 20 online stores between May and
September 2020. The following domains were used to store the code and collect stolen
bank card data during the new campaign:
• cloud-js[.]co.za
• host-js[.]co.za
• magento-cloud[.]co.za
• magento-js[.]co.za
• magento-security[.]co.za
• marketplace-magento[.]co.za
• marketplacemagento[.]co.za
• node-js[.]co.za
• node-js[.]co.za
• payment-js[.]co.za
• security-js[.]co.za
• web-js[.]co.za
Created on April 24, 2020 (during the second wave), these domains were registered with
the same registrars as those used to distribute the Vidar and Raccoon stealers and the
Buer and Smoke loaders.
The format of the links to the JS-sniffer files combined with the malware family type
suggest that FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators are behind the campaign to infect online
stores.
In addition, some domains involved in the campaign under investigation hosted a parked
page labeled "test page", like the one hosted on FakeSecurity domains:
• https://urlscan.io/result/0299b3e5-cbba-40be-adce-7ba437e4cb39/ microsoftcloud10[.]co.za
• https://urlscan.io/result/8f244d1b-2186-4db5-9c52-6122584dafa9/ - documentscloud-server[.]co.za

The evidence found indicates that the operators of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer family are
likely to be behind the multi-stage malicious campaign described above. According to our
information, even though the group gains initial access using non-self-developed tools
sold or rented on darknet forums, it continues to operate its exclusive JS-sniffer.
