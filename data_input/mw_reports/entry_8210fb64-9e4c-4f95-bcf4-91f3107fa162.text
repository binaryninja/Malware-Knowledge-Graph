CTA Adversary Playbook: Goblin Panda

November 1, 2018

Adversary Playbook: The FortiGuard SE Team is releasing this new playbook on the threat
actor group known as Goblin Panda as part of its role in the Cyber Threat Alliance. For more
information regarding this series of adversary playbooks being created by CTA members,
please visit the Cyber Threat Alliance Playbook Whitepaper.
Active since 2014, Goblin Panda is a threat actor that is focused on interests in Southeast
Asia. Goblin Panda has been documented by various organizations, including Fortinet, over
the past several years. Due to non-standardized naming conventions within the industry,
Goblin Panda is also known as APT 27, Hellsing, Cycledek, and perhaps 1937CN. Goblin
Panda is primarily active in South and Southeast Asia, with activity seen primarily in
Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. India has
also been targeted in the past, albeit in limited numbers.
Not much has been documented on this group for various reasons. This is primarily due the
fact that its tactics, techniques, and procedures have evolved over the years, and also
because rather than engaging in the sort of broad-brush attacks most cybercriminal gangs

engage in, their targets and campaigns have been quite specific in nature. We hope that the
information contained within our playbook is informative for responders who encounter one
of their attacks, or for anyone interested in Goblin Panda.
Overview
Favorite methodologies of Goblin Panda include the use of remote access Trojans, including
the infamous PlugX/Korplug, NewCore, and Sisfader RAT tools. Distribution of infected
samples are often used by attackers such as Goblin Panda through weaponized Microsoft
Office documents containing malicious macros, or by exploiting known vulnerabilities—most
recently CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2017-11882. Even though CVE-2012-0158 is over five
years old, attackers are quite aware that many organizations, especially up and coming
organizations in developing areas of the world, do not follow a regular patching schedule for
various reasons, such as lack of resources or awareness, and therefore remain vulnerable to
know exploits for long periods of time.
Methodology
Observed instances of Goblin Panda activity have generally started with a spearphishing
attacks via a maliciously crafted Microsoft Office document. When the document is opened
by the victim, various files are dropped into different locations of the victim’s PC. Dropped
files include legitimate software vendor files, an encrypted binary blog containing the
payload, and DLL files containing the decryptor and loader for the payload.
During the installation of the malware, a DLL hijacking technique to evade traditional
antivirus detections is used whereby a variety of legitimate DLL files from different vendors
are hijacked using a Trojanized version of a malicious DLL file. Once the malicious DLL file is
side loaded, it then downloads the Trojan downloader, which in turn sets a run key in the
registry for persistence. Typically, a legitimate program requires libraries to properly execute.
DLL sideloading/hijacking attacks makes the legitimate program think it is loading the correct
DLL, when in reality it is loading the malicious DLL instead. Finally, it also checks to
determine if it is running in a VM environment.
Once it is finished with those tasks, it then sends various parameters to a C2 server,
including:
·

OS version

·

Processor speed

·

Number of processors

·

Physical memory size

·

Computer name

2/6

·

User name

·

User privilege

·

Computer IP address

·

Volume serial number

When all of those parameters are deemed ok, it then downloads a payload. In most recent
cases, that payload has been the NewCore RAT (Korplug/Plugx and Sisfader were seen in
prior campaigns). The NewCore RAT is a malicious DLL file. However, executing the DLL
without using the downloader will not work as the C&C server string is not embedded within
the DLL file. Based on the strings found in its body, this malware may have been derived
from the PcClient and PcCortr backdoors whose source codes are publicly available,
especially on Chinese language coding forums.
NewCore RAT has the following attributes:
·

Copy files

·

Delete files

·

Execute files

·

Search files

·

Download files

·

Upload files

·

Retrieve disk list

·

Retrieve directory list

·

Retrieve file information

·

Retrieve disk information

·

Rename files

·

Screen monitoring

·

Start command shell

·

Shutdown/Reboot

We have also encountered several new NewCore RAT samples that may have been used by
the Goblin Panda threat actors. However, due to time constraints we were unable to analyze
them further to see if there is an absolute connection to the threat actor group. The following
IOCs have been provided for information purposes. Please see the Indictors of Compromise
section below for further details, along with our playbook viewer, which contains the tactics
and techniques defined by the Mitre ATT&CK knowledge base.
For a detailed technical overview, read our previous blog: Rehashed RAT Used in APT
Campaign Against Vietnamese Organizations
Indicators of Compromise
All samples (IOCs) have been provided in good faith. These samples had not been analyzed
at the time of publication due to time restrictions. As a result, there are no guarantees made
about the samples below with respect to Goblin Panda or any attributions to any threat actor.
