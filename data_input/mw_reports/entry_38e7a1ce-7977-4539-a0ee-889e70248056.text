Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China's Government Agency

1 Background
Recently, ANTIY Labs detected an APT attack targeting some government agency in China. The Shellcode for
communication is conducted depending on Beacon mode which is generated on the basis of automatic attack
detection platform-Cobalt Strike. This kind of attack pattern disguising as non-malicious real file in the host of its
target, it sending a network heartbeat package every 60 seconds, and it also send data information via the Cookie
field, all these features of this attack pattern are designed to evade the detection of security software and the
interception of firewall on the targeted host. Considering the relationship between this attack and Cobalt Strike
platform, we name it as APT-TOCS (TOCS refers to Threat on Cobalt Strike.) for now.
The core step of APT-TOCS is downloading the script functionalities of Shellcode, which downloads a field of data
into memory for operation by calling powershell.exe.The decrypted data is a field of executable Shellcode that is
generated by Cobalt Strike (An automatic attack testing platform). After loading the script of Shellcode, the
Analysis Group of ANTIY did a series of correlation analysis, then we found a PE program that maybe act as a
guiding executable file in similar attacks. The loaded Shellcode script can be used to call command line to add a
certain field of encrypted date into memory and run it. The decrypted date turns out to be executable Shellcode
which is generated by Cobalt Strike. The related script can be loaded via the guiding PE program or vulnerability.
This kind of attack pattern has several features which including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations,
communicating via Beacon, multi-beacon communication is acceptable, and several Beacons can work
simultaneously. Such attack can be launched without the support of vector file, in fact it depends on network
projection and laterally move in the internal network as required conducting an attack. So, it will bring great
difficulties to the forensic work. It is important to note that, all the Sandboxes we know are disabling to fight
against this kind of attack.
It seems that the attack capability of APT-TOCS is close to that of APT-level. However, it relied on automatic
attack testing platform instead of abilities of the attack team.

2 Analysis on incident sample
2.1 Leading files and sample downloading
APT-TOCS used “powershell.exe” to execute Shellcode scripts to realize remote control on targeted system. The
analysts of Antiy thought that the attacker might know several remote injection methods of script downloading
privilege, such as directly making the scrip be executed on the host by using security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile,
we found the following binary leading attack files (hereinafter referred to as Sample A) were used in similar attacks
before:
Virus name

Trojan/Win32.MSShell

Original file name

ab.exe

MD5

44BCF2DD262F12222ADEAB6F59B2975B

Processor structure

Compilation language

The functionality code of the scripts embedded in this PE sample is completely the same with the one of Shellcode
script Antiy has acquired, while the encryption data of them differs from each other. This PE sample was firstly
uploaded to Virustotal on May 2, 2015:

Figure 1 Downloading encryption data using powershell.exe embedded in PE files

The PE sample used WinExec to operate embedded malware:

Figure 2 Using function WinExec to call powershell.exe to download leading data

Therefore, we can see that the “leading file” can be regarded as the leading part of attack. However, the execution
and control still can be made depending on system and application vulnerabilities without this leading file.
According to above information, we cannot make sure this leading sample has relationship with this APT incident.

Though the data of module 3 started with “MZ”, it does not belong to PE files. Instead, it is the Shellcode with
backdoor functionality.

Figure 9 Shellcode that started with MZ（4D 5A）

2.7 Analysis on module 3
The module might connect the following 2 addresses with port 80:


146.0.***.***



dc.******69.info (146.0.***.***) (Romania)

(Romania)

Sending request data and receiving return data.

Figure 10 Sending request data

The decryption to above IP, domains and accessing addresses is “XOR 0x69”.
Judging from the module strings and the system functions, the module belongs to backdoor program that can send
GET request to designated addresses and heartbeat packages by using Cookie fields with 60 seconds’ interval. The
heartbeat package data includes: check code, process ID, system version, IP address, computer name, account,
whether it is 64 bit process. Then it transmits by making use of both RSA and BASE64 encryption.

Figure 11 The original data of heartbeat package

As the process ID and check code are different, the transmitted heartbeat package data are different each time. The
check code is calculated through using process ID and the millisecond process during system startup. The algorithm
is as follows:

The encrypted heartbeat package used Cookie field to transmit:

3 The authentication analysis on the technology sources of this attack
The leading PE files, Sample_A and Sample B, associated by analysts of Antiy CERT used the exactly same
method of PowerShell. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that Sample_A has no positive connection
with this attack due to the high standardization of relevant scripts. We still consider it as a series of attack incidents
based on other comprehensive analysis. The attacker might exploit the following ways to control the target host,
such as social engineering e-mails, file bundling, exploiting system and application vulneratbilities, lateral

movement of intranet and so on.
We found “Beacon” strings when analyzing “Module 1”. According to existed experience, we doubted that
Shellcode is closely related with automatic attack testing platform Cobalt Strike. Therefore, our analysts carried out
comparison analysis on Beacon generated by Cobalt Strike, and authenticated the relationships between them.
Cobalt Strike is the GUI framework penetration tool based on metasploit. The business version of it integrates the
following characteristics: service scan, automatic overflow, multi-mode port espionage, various Trojan generation,
phishing attack, site clone, target information obtaining, automatic browser attack and so on.

3.1 Comparison of Module 1
We compared module 1 and the payload generated by using Beacon, and found only the following different data:
the Head data, request file name and IP address.

Figure 14 Comparison of Module 1

The left is sample module 1, while the right is the module generated by Beacon. We can lead to the conclusion from
the comparison: module 1 is generated by Beacon.

3.2 Comparison of disassembling commands of module 2
Our analysts compared sample module 2 and relevant files of Beacon, and found that the disassembling commands
between them are exactly the same with exception of functionality code, including XOR encryption at the entry,
downloading system DLL, obtaining function address, function calling modes and so on. The following lists three
points.

3.4 Characteristics of Cobalt Strike
Using Cobalt Strike attack can execute various operations in the targeted systems, such as downloading and
uploading files, executing designated programs, injecting keyboard recorder, executing commands via PowerShell,
importing PowerShell script, executing commands via CMD, accessing system passwords and so on.
Cobalt Strike has the following characteristics:


Penetrating sandbox



Avoiding whitelist mechanism and cloud detection



Intranet penetration



Persistent attacks



Attacking various platforms

4 Conclusion
With an automated test platform Cobalt Strike, the attack penetration can penetrate firewall, the approach the
attackers used to control targeted host is covert and undetectable; what’s more, it can attack various platforms, such

as Windows, Linux, Mac etc.; it’s formidable adversary to Trusted Computing, Cloud Detection, Sandbox
Detection and so on. According to the traces in the past, we believe that the threat has been active for 5 years;
unfortunately, there isn’t any powerful detection production and methods to defeat the malicious attack till now.
The reason why the CERT Analysis Team of ANTIY classified APT-TOCS into APT incidents is that it’s a kind of
targeted attack (one of the features of APT attack), it has anti-detection functions and also it can conceal itself.
Compared with APT incidents in the past, the APT attack in this case doesn’t cost too much, and the attackers
aren’t responsible for coding. With the application of commercial attack platform, the attackers saved the cost of
an attack, also the vulnerability built joint function provided by relevant attack platform make the attackers easy to
do injection. As a result, nations and organizations which without its own elite hacker groups and abundant capital
can also launch some kind of APT attack via the attack pattern mentioned in this case. Meanwhile, it’s more
difficult for us to tracing when facing such modeled attack.
One of the leaders in Information Security area-Bruce Schiner said, “when big events on information security
happened, people tend to treat it as an example of cyber warfare. It’s ridiculous. From my point of view, what’s
happening and going to happen is: more and more tactics in physical warfare are applied to cyber warfare. It’s
important to note that, attack capabilities can be widely distributed if attackers take full advantages of certain
technology, especially computer technology can make attack more powerful and automated.” Obviously, highly
automated commercial platform realized a high speed of spread of this attack capability (exceeded our
anticipation).
We have to remind all relevant parties that we are confronting with the risk of large scale diffusion of network
armaments which is led by the low cost of the attack capability. The commercial penetration attack detecting
platform has two sides, on one hand, it can check the network environment of systems effectively, on the other hand,
for nations, organizations and industries which has limited budget, it costs too much. Given the situation, all related
parties should conduct more communication with each other, additionally, there is no doubt that both offensive
party and defensive party are supported by superpowers, these superpowers should prevent the attack technique
from widely distributing.
The incident mentioned there has no difference with other cases we detected in the past, it shows that, on the way to
realize national informatizaion, we must fight against serious security challenges as we confronting now; it’s also a
good opportunity for our Chinese people and enterprises to demonstrate our faith and the efforts we made to
conquer the challenge.
