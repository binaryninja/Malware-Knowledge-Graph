QNAP warns customers of an actively exploited Roon Server zero-day bug and eCh0raix
ransomware attacks targeting their Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices.
This warning comes only two weeks after QNAP users were alerted of an ongoing
AgeLocker ransomware outbreak.
The Taiwan-based NAS appliance maker says that it has received reports of devices
impacted by eCh0raix ransomware in a security advisory published today.
"The eCh0raix ransomware has been reported to affect QNAP NAS devices," the company
said. "Devices using weak passwords may be susceptible to attack.
QNAP urged customers to "act immediately" to protect their data from potential eCh0raix
attacks by:

Using stronger passwords for your administrator accounts.
Enabling IP Access Protection to protect accounts from brute force attacks.
Avoiding using default port numbers 443 and 8080.
Detailed step-by-step instructions on changing your NAS password, enabling IP Access
Protection, and changing the system port number are available in the security advisory.
While QNAP doesn't mention how many reports it received from users directly affected by
eCh0raix ransomware in the last weeks, BleepingComputer has seen an uptick in attack
reports on the highly active eCh0raix support topic.

eCh0raix activity (ID Ransomware)

Actively exploited Roon Server zero-day
Today, although not making a direct connection with the eCh0raix attacks, QNAP also
warned of an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability impacting Roon Labs' Roon Server
2021-02-01 and earlier versions.
The company recommends disabling the Roon Server music server and not exposing the
NAS on the Internet to protect it from these active attacks until Roon Labs provides a
security update.
To disable Roon Server on your NAS, you have to follow this procedure:
1. Log on to QTS as administrator.
2. Open the App Center and then click . A search box appears.
3. Type "Roon Server" and then press ENTER. Roon Server appears in the search
results.
4. Click the arrow below the Roon Server icon.
5. Select Stop. The application is disabled.
QNAP also fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Malware Remover app on
Thursday.

This security flaw would allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on devices
running vulnerable app versions.

Heavily targeted by ransomware
QNAP devices were previously targeted by eCh0raix ransomware (also known as
QNAPCrypt) in June 2019 and June 2020.
A massive Qlocker ransomware campaign also hit QNAP devices starting mid-April, with the
threat actors behind the attacks making $260,000 in just five days by remotely encrypting
data using the 7zip archive program.
Additionally, QNAP removed a backdoor account (aka hardcoded credentials) in the HBS 3
Hybrid Backup Sync backup and disaster recovery app.
It was later confirmed that Qlocker ransomware operators used the removed backdoor
account to hack into some QNAP customers' NAS devices and encrypt their files.
As mentioned in the beginning, AgeLocker ransomware also hit QNAP customers two weeks
ago and in another campaign targeting publicly exposed NAS devices exploiting vulnerable
Photo Station versions during September 2020.
