INTRODUCTION
The Dragos Year in Review report is an annual analysis of
Industrial Control System (ICS)/Operational Technology
(OT) focused cyber threats, vulnerabilities, assessments,
and incident response insights.1 The ICS/OT community has
long suffered from a lack of public insights into these types
of problem areas to have a meaningful discussion on how
to address the issues. It is the Dragos team’s goal to share
the observations and lessons learned with the industrial
community for data-driven analysis and recommendations.
In 2020, the industrial community performed amazing feats
to keep civilization running under extremely challenging
circumstances with the global pandemic. Infrastructure
providers kept key services and goods available including
electric power, manufactured goods, water, oil and gas,
mining, chemical, rail, and transport while many faced
hardships globally. As a result of these efforts, organizations
shifted in how they conducted business to include an
increasingly connected industrial environment. This is a
trend that has existed for many years, even while many
organizations still believed they had highly segmented or
even air-gapped ICS networks. The risk to ICS is not born from
an IT and OT convergence, but instead from a convergence
of an increasingly ICS-aware and capable threat landscape
with the digital transformation and hyperconnectivity of
the industrial community. This report captures how some of
the community is performing and progressing, and areas of
improvement that will be needed to continue to provide safe
and reliable operations.

IN THE HEADLINES
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
MITRE introduced ATT&CK
for ICS in 2020 to codify and
communicate the unique threat
behaviors, or Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (TTPs), that
ICS adversaries use against OT
targets. This independent and
community-sourced framework
provides a common lexicon
for categorizing ICS-specific
TTPs to support reporting and
further analysis. Dragos uses
the framework internally and
continues to contribute to this
program and community resource.
The Year in Review report
leverages information from MITRE
ATT&CK about observed activity
in ICS environments to help
defenders mitigate threats to their
organizations.

EKANS

Ripple20, AMNESIA:33
Third-party code integration can pose risks to
industrial operations. Many vendors do not track
third-party code libraries, and therefore cannot
accurately inform customers if their products
are impacted. Vendors are beholden to software
manufacturers to release fixes for vulnerabilities
that may impact thousands of products. For
example, security researchers disclosed multiple
vulnerabilities in TCP/IP software libraries called
Ripple202 and AMNESIA:333 that potentially
impacted many ICS vendors. Example ICS devices
impacted include Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs), Serial to Ethernet Converters, Protocol
Converters, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), digital
protective relays, and some managed network
switches and routers. Most of the devices impacted
by the vulnerabilities were not accurately identified
and did not have advisories released due to the
difficulty in understanding third-party code
adoption. Security design flaws in the impacted
devices may make this collection of flaws
less relevant to adversaries, but the disclosure
highlights supply chain risks and complexity.

EKANS represents a specific threat to ICS because of its incorporation of potential process
and operational disruption features. This ransomware is capable of stopping ICS-related
Windows processes before initiating encryption. EKANS activity could produce an unstable
or physically disruptive situation by abruptly ending an operationally significant process.
The Dragos Intelligence team assesses EKANS is related to a previous strain of ransomware
called MEGACORTEX. Throughout 2020, Dragos identified new EKANS activity targeting
multiple verticals including electric, oil and gas, medical, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and
automotive. Public targets included Fresenius Kabi, a pharmaceutical division of the European
company Fresenius Group; global manufacturer Honda; and Italian energy company Enel.

Multiple ICS entities were impacted by a
massive supply chain compromise first
revealed in December 2020.4 Adversaries
compromised SolarWinds Orion business
software to distribute malware. The
adversary had unfettered access for more
than 14 months and is thought to now
have access to other supply chain access
points throughout the community.
Identifying SolarWinds in ICS
environments was challenging. To
respond appropriately, facilities required
accurate asset lists, software version
information, and network monitoring
to identity post-exploitation activity.
Dragos investigated numerous confirmed
compromises. The investigations reverted
to limited host-based analysis and could
only capture days or weeks in analysis. In
an ICS network where not all endpoints
can have robust host logging and in
compromises where adversaries leverage
the network extensively, it is preferred to
have network traffic analysis and logging.
Given the current lack of visibility in
industrial networks the assessment of
SolarWinds’ compromise impact is likely
to not be fully understood for years.
In some cases plant personnel purchased

5

SolarWinds directly, and organizations were
unaware they had it in their environments.
More commonly though, many integrators,
support contracts, and ICS suppliers
use software, including SolarWinds, as
white-labeled solutions. This means the
product is in place but under a different
name. Suppliers may use the software
themselves on behalf of the client where the
compromised SolarWinds software was not
in the end-users ICS network. The software
may have been present in the supplier or
integrator’s network and used in the enduser’s networks across direct connections
or maintenance links. SolarWinds often
has access directly to the control level
in ICS networks which would allow an
adversary to not only have access to these
environments, but direct control of them.
Many organizations that did not believe they
were impacted were compromised directly
or accessed from compromised networks
due to third-parties.
Dragos is aware of at least two global
ICS Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) that were using the compromised
SolarWinds software across maintenance
links into ICS networks, including where
there was turbine control software.5

Remote Access Risk
s Continue
in ICS Environment
s
Prior to 2020, OT-targeting adversaries exploited remote services to
compromise ICS environments. This technique gained popularity
as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally. Companies began
requiring some workers to remain at home in 2020, even those
working in industrial environments. Multiple ICS-targeting threat
groups historically targeted remote access technologies or logon
infrastructure including PARISITE, MAGNALLIUM, ALLANITE, and
XENOTIME. This includes compromise of Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) assets. VPN equipment
is a common access point for OEMs and integrators to gain access
to operations environments. Although many organizations focus
on prevention and segmentation, obtaining access through a
compromised VPN may allow an adversary into an ICS network
with limited detection capabilities. For example, in 2019 the Dragos
team reported on the threat group PARISITE noting it was the
access operations team for the MAGNALLIUM group and explicitly
targeted OT boundary equipment, such as VPNs, for the likely
purpose of gaining access to ICS networks.

SECTION ONE

ICS Threat
Landscape

9

INTRODUCTION
Cyber risk to industrial sectors has grown and accelerated dramatically, led by ransomware
impacting industrial processes, intrusions enabling information gathering and process
information theft, and new activity from adversaries targeting ICS. Dragos emphasizes
the importance of understanding how adversaries steal information and gain access
to better prepare for adversary behavior in the future. Adversaries often build programs
and campaigns slowly over time, with later campaigns often being more successful and
disruptive due to previous efforts.
Some threats tracked by Dragos may proliferate into disruptive and destructive capabilities
later, though no such activity is observed at this time. For example, the team would track
a threat that was explicitly targeting electric companies with theming toward engineers,
engineering projects, or electric operations, though there may be limited or no visibility to
confirm if the adversary gained access to ICS networks. The team would not track a threat if
it was simply trying to gain access to an electric company. The fundamental assessment of
threats tracked by Dragos is that they are explicitly trying to gain access to ICS networks and
operations or are successful in achieving access.
These types of events, where adversaries gain access to ICS networks but do not have the
intention of currently disrupting them, are much more common than is publicly reported.
The threats are learning ICS. Although not every compromise will relate to an impact today,
many may inform the attacks of the future. Dragos tracks 15 threat Activity Groups, or threat
groups,6 with four of the groups discovered in 2020. Threats are growing at a rate three
times faster than they are going dormant.7 This is likely due to the increased investment
made by adversaries in targeting ICS over the last five to 10 years, and whose investment
will continue to accelerate the ICS threat environment.

MAJOR ICS THREAT TRENDS IN 2020
• ICS THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY
Organizations track threats in unique ways. At Dragos, analysts utilize the
Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis, which is a common and industry
accepted methodology to cluster intrusions into groups representing teams of
adversaries that operate in similar ways. The Diamond Model is an open and
well-documented framework that allows for transparency in how this analysis
is conducted. https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/
diamond.pdf
7
Every year feels like the headlines are, “Threats are Getting Worse,” or “Risk
is Increasing.” A useful way to track the evolution of the threat landscape is to
determine how many new threat groups are identified compared to how many
are going dormant. Groups that are not observed performing new intrusions
within a 12-month period are moved to a dormant phase. Typically the growth
rate would be less than two groups being created for every group that goes
dormant.

Key Updates on
Existing Activity Groups
Throughout 2020, the 11 Activity Groups
identified prior to 2020 remained active
against industrial organizations. While
already covered in previous Year in Review
reports, the following key activities occurred
in 2020 that are worth noting:

In March, PARISITE leveraged Citrix vulnerability CVE-2019-19781 in intrusions
targeting North American electric and oil and gas entities. This was concerning
given that PARISITE conducts initial access operations potentially enabling future
disruptive operations associated with MAGNALLIUM. This exemplifies the critical
need to track any groups interested in ICS through IT networks. In one example,
Dragos responded to an incident where PARISITE was identified internal to the
organization before MAGNALLIUM could act. Intelligence-informed decisions can and
have helped organizations prioritize efforts successfully.
In April, new DTrack malware emerged with the ability to communicate with Fujitsu
Systemwalker management software utilized in distributed computing and data
center management operations. Dragos associated this activity with the energytargeting group WASSONITE. Interaction with this type of software can significantly
impact data center and computational environments resulting in potential ICS or
broader operational impacts.
ALLANITE and DYMALLOY remain critical threats to infrastructure operations,
especially in Europe and North America. In May, Dragos observed ALLANITE
conducting credential harvesting via watering hole attacks. This was followed by use
of captured credentials and built-in system tools to launch intrusions into the German
electric system, and potentially water and wastewater sectors. ALLANITE and
DYMALLOY continued to target multiple United States (U.S.) industrial entities from
September through October 2020. Operations included use of ZeroLogon to further
intrusions into victim networks. CHRYSENE showed continued activity with further
malware development and used new tools to infiltrate ICS networks in the Middle
East for intelligence gathering purposes.

Target Geography

STIBNITE

Azerbaijan
STIBNITE specifically targets wind turbine companies
that generate electric power in Azerbaijan. Based
on current collection efforts, the activity appears
confined exclusively to Azerbaijan. There is
ongoing kinetic conflict in the region between
Azerbaijan and Armenia due to rights to disputed
territory. Historically when there is regional conflict
between states, there tends to be targeting of critical
infrastructure, including electric operations. There
is only a loose correlation between the conflict and
STIBNITE operations, and the Dragos team is not
making an assessment on who may be responsible
for the targeting.8 Given the specific targeting and
the regional conflict, it is a situation and threat group
worth watching closely.
STIBNITE’s victims share unique technology with
wind farms in Ukraine. One possibility for the specific
victim targeting is that adversaries targeted the
supplier and maintainer for the wind farm itself. The
supplier, operator, and maintainer are all based in
Ukraine.
STIBNITE used shared Command and Control (C2)
infrastructure between multiple intrusions in late
2020 and updated its malware capabilities to avoid
detection after public reports on its activity were
released. STIBNITE uses PoetRAT remote access
malware in its intrusion operations to gather
information, take screenshots, transfer files, and
execute commands on victim systems. STIBNITE
gains initial access via credential theft websites
spoofing Azerbaijan government organizations and
phishing campaigns using variants of malicious
Microsoft Office documents. STIBNITE also used
information related to the global COVID-19 pandemic
for malicious document themes.

TALONITE
TALONITE‘s operations focus on near exclusive
interest in initial access compromises in the U.S.
electric sector. The group uses phishing techniques
to deliver either malicious documents or executables.
TALONITE uses two custom malware families known
as LookBack and FlowCloud for information gathering
operations.9
TALONITE’s phishing campaigns utilize electric
and power grid engineering-specific themes and
concepts, indicating an intent to gain a foothold
within energy sector entities. Such access could
facilitate gathering host and identity information,
collecting sensitive operational data, or mapping the
enterprise environment to identify points of contact
with ICS. The identified infrastructure and phishing
emails spoofed the National Council of Examiners for
Engineering and Surveying (NCEES), North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and Global Energy
Certification (GEC).
TALONITE employs malware using legitimate binaries
maliciously, or modifies such binaries to include
additional functionality. For example, LookBack
malware contains persistence mechanisms that add
two Windows registry keys to execute legitimate but
modified files when the infected user next logs in.
FlowCloud launches a renamed copy of the legitimate
HTML Help Workshop (hhw.exe) utility from
Microsoft. The group uses a combination of owned
and compromised network infrastructure.

Target Geography

KAMACITE
In 2020, KAMACITE targeted U.S. energy companies by
leveraging stolen credentials or brute force logons of
remote services to access victim networks. Dragos tracks
KAMACITE as a significant threat to industrial operations
because of strong overlaps between KAMACITE and the
Sandworm group, which enabled a disruptive cyberattack
to electric operations in Ukraine.
Sandworm is a group tracked by FireEye analysts covering
a wide variety of ICS and non-ICS specific targeting.
KAMACITE represents the specific, ICS-targeting access
enablement component observed by Dragos. KAMACITE
also represents a long-running set of related behaviors
targeting critical infrastructure and industrial verticals.
KAMACITE is a unique group due to new intrusions and
evolution in tradecraft distinct from original Sandworm
activity.10
Dragos assesses KAMACITE is an access-enablement
team that operates to support other teams conducting
disruptive and destructive effects.11 Previously, Dragos
identified ELECTRUM as the group responsible for the
Ukraine 2016 electric transmission substation cyberattack.
The important distinction is that in Dragos’s analysis,
KAMACITE conducted the access operations, enabling
ELECTRUM to create and use CRASHOVERRIDE malware
to carry out the attack. Dragos determined this based on
behavioral differentiations from ELECTRUM activity and
earlier access operations demonstrating two distinct
groups of activity.
In 2020, KAMACITE was observed performing
reconnaissance against numerous energy companies in
the U.S. Following its reconnaissance, it attempted to take
advantage of webmail of those companies and cloudbased logon services including Microsoft Active Directory
(AD) and Office 365 services. In addition to this activity,
Dragos verified Server Message Block (SMB) (TCP 445)
connections from KAMACITE infrastructure to victims
that could indicate some successful access attempts. The
precise nature of this connectivity is unknown.
It is common for the information security community to look at threat group names as names, when in reality they are
definitions. Sandworm is tracked by FireEye. While links can be seen to others’ groups, the definition, collection efforts,
and analysis of the FireEye analysts are distinct from those at Dragos and proprietary. Dragos decided to start tracking
KAMACITE, associated with a link to Sandworm, upon new activity and unique collection emerging in 2020. 11 Dragos
has unique visibility and tracks intrusions that are still active as of this past year. Dragos tracks KAMACITE separately
from Sandworm activity. Dragos is not attempting to rename Sandworm, but is merely organizing the ICS activity
explicitly to support the development of defenses against this group.

VANADINITE
VANADINITE conducted various initial access
operations targeting industrial entities across the
energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors
in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
Dragos assesses this group’s activity is focused
on information gathering operations, including
specifically ICS compromise and data theft. Obtaining
documents and intellectual property relating to ICS
processes, function, and design could enable this
group’s sponsor entity to develop ICS capabilities.
VANADINITE’s activity supports long-term strategic
advances rather than disruptive or destructive effects.
Dragos assesses with low confidence VANADINITE is
responsible for the ColdLock ransomware attack that
targeted Taiwanese state-owned ICS companies and
caused indirect disruption to operations. The objective
of this attack — whether financial gain or disruptive
messaging — is unclear.
Dragos consistently observed a pattern in
VANADINITE behavior, including the targeting of
recently disclosed “n+1” vulnerabilities in a range
of networking and gateway devices impacting
remote access services like VPNs. Asset owners and
operators should treat vulnerabilities in externalfacing network appliances as a serious issue. Dragos
observed multiple entities, including PARISITE,
increasingly adopt this methodology. These remote
access technologies often directly enable access to
ICS networks bypassing enterprise networks and are
commonly used by integrators and ICS OEMs.

ICS Vulnerabilities

18

INTRODUCTION

Dragos researchers analyzed 703 ICS/OT vulnerabilities
in 2020. For each vulnerability, Dragos independently
assesses and confirms – and often corrects – the
advisories describing flaws in firmware or software.
The vulnerabilities Dragos analyzes are identified by
independent security researchers, the Department of
Homeland Security’s ICS-Computer Emergency Readiness
Team (CERT), vendors, and Dragos analysts.
Dragos analyzed 29 percent more vulnerabilities in
2020 than 2019, demonstrating a rise in publicly known
flaws in systems supporting industrial operations. Of
individually reviewed vulnerabilities, 33 percent contained
errors in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) score, potentially impacting patching decisions
made by asset owners and operators. Over one-third of
vulnerabilities could cause a loss of view and control if
exploited by an adversary. Public Proof of Concepts (POCs)
were available for 30 vulnerabilities reviewed by Dragos,
meaning available resources indicated specifically how an
adversary could operationalize the flaw.

| ICS CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2020

19

2020 Vulnerability Details
Twenty-three percent of
vulnerabilities Dragos analyzed
applied to products bordering
the enterprise. This can include
networking communication
equipment, VPNs, data historians, or
firewalls commonly deployed in ICS
networks. This number is up from
21 percent in 2019. ICS-targeting
adversaries, including VANADINITE
and PARISITE, have historically
leveraged such vulnerabilities for
initial access to target environments
and pose a risk to industrial operators.
These vulnerabilities are of particular
interest, as they can provide
immediate access to the ICS networks
bypassing enterprise security controls.

Most vulnerabilities resided deep within the
ICS network, meaning they apply to equipment
on Levels 0 to 3 of the Purdue Model.12 This
includes engineering workstations, PLCs,
sensors, and industrial controllers. These
vulnerabilities require access to a control
system network to exploit, offering some
mitigation for organizations provided they
implement proper network segmentation.
With the increasing connectivity in
organizations, this security control is
diminishing in value and should be enhanced
with efforts such as network monitoring, and
where possible, Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for remote sessions.

The percentage of disclosed flaws that

attributed to the increase in identified
vulnerabilities bordering the enterprise that
do not have direct operational impacts.

| ICS CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2020

21

2020 Vulnerability Severity
In addition to validating the
CVSS, Dragos categorizes
vulnerabilities based on severity.
The following taxonomy is used:

Immediate Action

A far-reaching threat or vulnerability calling for action broadly
across at least one industry.

Limited Threat

A limited threat, risk, or vulnerability requiring an applicability
assessment before taking action.

Possible Threat

Threat scenarios, research, and vulnerabilities relating to
operations but not requiring direct/immediate action.

No Action Required

Items of interest but likely requiring no action except in unique
threat models.

Hype

A story or vulnerability receiving coverage but not yet worth the
attention of operators.

| ICS CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2020

22

In examining individual vulnerabilities, Dragos also categorizes them based on the
“Now, Next, Never” system, a malleable framework developed by CERT/Coordination
Center (CC) to help asset owners and operators identify vulnerabilities and prioritize
patching. The framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution for patch management.
When combined with consequence-driven threat modeling, it can help OT security
practitioners determine when and if to fix flaws in industrial control equipment.

The “Now” flaws require immediate action.
These flaws include critical vulnerabilities such
as perimeter-facing and network exploitable
vulnerabilities, and other vulnerabilities that should
be addressed as soon as practicable.

7%

7%

Limited Threat vulnerabilities fall into the “Next”
category. These might be network exploitable but are
present deeper in the network and require more work,
access, and knowledge for an adversary to exploit
or impact OT processes. If an operations network
does not have proper segmentation or is accessible
from the internet, asset owners and operators should
consider the “Next” vulnerabilities a greater risk. In
most cases, these vulnerabilities can be mitigated
simply by updating firewall rules. It is important that
customers conduct a firewall rule audit on a regular
basis and justify every allow rule. In 2020, close to
two-thirds of vulnerabilities assessed by Dragos were
considered “Next,” a Limited Threat.

58%

Low vulnerabilities pose a possible threat but rarely
require action in vulnerability prioritization. They
can be considered “Never” vulnerabilities. It is
more beneficial for an organization to monitor its
environment for signs of exploitation rather than
to take devices and services offline to patch, or
take appropriate mitigation measures. Although
considered “Never” vulnerabilities, Dragos analysts
do not recommend ignoring them entirely if time
and resources permit. The reality is patching in
ICS is more difficult than in most enterprise IT
networks, and the value presented from patching
these vulnerabilities is minimal. Asset owners
and operators should conduct risk assessments to
determine if it is safe to continue operations without
addressing the identified vulnerabilities.

Actionable Guidance Missing
in Most 2020 Advisories
An increase in the reported number of ICS vulnerabilities overall coincided with an
increase in vendors providing patches alongside publicly disclosed flaws. Twentytwo percent of advisories did not have a patch when announced, down from 26
percent year-over-year. Of those, more than two-thirds did not contain practical
mitigation advice.
Frequently, vendors will not provide advice to asset owners and operators if they
are unable to patch the identified vulnerability. Dragos identified 61 percent of
advisories contained a patch to fix the vulnerability, but no alternative mitigation if
patching was not an option.

Flaws in TCP/IP Stacks
Researchers identified several third-party vulnerabilities in the software
supply chain that impacted ICS systems. Most notable were Ripple20
and Amnesia:33, commercial names for vulnerabilities in third-party
Internet Protocol (IP) stacks. These third-party stacks are used in many
embedded products, including some used in industrial products and
industrial-supporting Information Technology (IT) systems. Example ICS
devices impacted include PLCs, Serial to Ethernet Converters, Protocol
Converters, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), digital protective relays, and
some managed network switches and routers.
Mass exploitation of these vulnerabilities, like the similar URGENT/11
vulnerabilities reported in 2019, is rare. No organizations have provided
evidence of public exploitation.
Devices that use third-party protocol stacks are often deeply embedded
systems. Exploitation requires understanding the Central Processing
Unit (CPU) architecture, memory layout, and hardware connections
of the vulnerable device. Developing a working exploit requires a deep
understanding of embedded systems. Once an exploit is developed, it
may not even function on the same product if, for example, the product
undergoes a hardware revision.
Fundamentally, these vulnerabilities are not a high risk for the industrial
sector. In the industrial space, embedded systems are still most often
“insecure by design,” or lacking some security protections. An example of
this is the APC Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) susceptibility to the
Ripple20 vulnerabilities. The researchers of the vulnerabilities developed
a working exploit for CVE-2020-11901 against the UPS, which could result
in shutting off the UPS. However, the UPS speaks an industrial protocol
called BACnet that lacks basic security protections. According to the
device instruction manual, and verified by Dragos, a BACnet control
point can be used to achieve the same effect using freely available tools.

Vulnerabilities
in VPN
Appliances
Facilitating
Remote Work

Several VPN appliance vulnerabilities were disclosed and fixed in 2020. These include
issues in non-industrial appliances that Dragos tracks and models that are specifically
marketed toward industrial customers. In 2020, Dragos tracked 13 advisories that
include VPN software and hardware commonly used in industrial environments and
gateways with optional VPN features. Impacted devices include Palo Alto Networks
Global Protect VPN client, Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Netscaler, and ICSspecific VPN services Ewon, Cosy, and Flexy.
Enterprise VPN appliances are often used by industrial operators to provide remote
access to corporate and operations networks. Some OEMs provide VPN access
specifically for their ICS equipment, restricting connections or lateral movement to the
rest of the OT network. Many of these products are identified as belonging to utilities
via the popular search engine Shodan. Vulnerabilities in these products should be
remediated quickly.
End users should determine the exposure of VPN appliances. Industrial-specific VPN
appliances may provide direct access to process control systems. These devices are best
secured by using them in “client” mode where they may connect to a central server. The
central server may be hardened to prevent site-to-site communications between field
sites, and to monitor for suspicious behavior originating from field sites.

Lessons Learned

Front

INTRODUCTION

For the last two decades, the prevailing strategies for safeguarding
ICS were focused on protecting the perimeter, preventative security
countermeasures, and internal segmentation. In that time, standards,
regulations, and best practices codified these methods. Other
focuses, such as detection, response, and recovery were included
but without equal emphasis or examples. The disparity has left
industrial organizations underdeveloped in these core capabilities in
an understandable, yet undesirable, situation. In general, the industry
lacks visibility into their ICS assets and activities, hampering the overall
cyber readiness and ability to understand and manage cyber risk.
These themes are confirmed based upon analysis of Dragos service
engagements in 2020.
The data set includes engagements from many industrial infrastructure
sectors including electric, oil and gas, food and agriculture,
manufacturing, chemical, transportation, water and wastewater,
technology (data center building automation equipment), and mining.

Visibility
Over the course of the year, Dragos found
that 90 percent of its services customers
had limited to no visibility into their
ICS environments. While most clients
demonstrated a focus on an enhanced asset
inventory, this effort is only the foundation
for asset visibility. Many customers only
monitored the IT to OT boundary without
monitoring activity inside the ICS network.
Network analysts were blind to critical
network traffic. Some collected logs,
but few utilized centralized logging to
correlate various segments with network
traffic analysis. These steps are critical for
developing a full picture of what occurred
across industrial assets and sites.

Compared to the Dragos 2019 Year in Review report, 90 percent represents
a small increase in this statistic. Note that this is not indicative of the same
customers failing to improve year-over-year. Lack of visibility, a common finding
in architecture reviews, is skewed heavily towards new customers. Architecture
reviews conducted with repeat customers are typically not for the same facility
either. While not a perfect comparison, the statistic indicates the state of
cybersecurity for those customers early in their OT cyber maturity.
Dragos’s incident response cases for 2020 provide further support for this lack
of visibility because none of them were augmented with any centralized or
automated host and network traffic logging. This significantly slows down the
incident response process, and in multiple cases, means that the asset owner or
operator is not able to get critical questions answered. In at least one case, the
impact led to public reporting without an understanding of root cause analysis
where cyber activity was heavily suspected, but no evidence was available.

Segmentation
and Connections
Although asset owners and operators
follow many of the best practices and
their applicable regulation, Dragos
continues to observe instances of poor
segmentation with unexpected or
unknown connections from the ICS
network. About 88 percent of Dragos
services engagements involved significant
issues with network segmentation.
Examples of observations contributing
to this statistic include flat networks,
where the only segmentation is the initial
firewall between the IT-OT boundary, and
unnecessary communication pathways
to critical assets within the network. To
further illustrate the incidence of poor
segmentation, consider that adversaries
accessed ICS networks directly from the
internet in 100 percent of Dragos’s 2020
incident response cases. These findings
are directly related to the previous statistic
of 90 percent of organizations that lacked
OT visibility. Identifying architecture
bypasses and rogue connections and
devices is nearly impossible without
visibility through network monitoring.

While the annual comparison shows a 17-point increase in engagements
exhibiting poor security perimeters, Dragos does not believe the industry
is regressing on this security principle. Dragos attributes the growth to a
rise in the number of engagements conducted. However, this statistic does
support the assertion that cyber strategies focused on segmentation and
prevention are not sufficient.
Adversary usage of shared credentials exacerbates the severity of poor
security perimeters. Just over half of service engagements found shared
credentials between IT and OT networks. For example, an organization
may leverage the same credential management on the IT network as it
does on the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and ICS network. This is another
configuration that leads to a weakening of perimeters and may enable
an adversary to easily traverse to ICS assets using credentials obtained
from IT accounts. For example, 100 percent of incident response cases
that confirmed adversary activity involved the adversary leveraging
shared credentials for lateral movement. During one case, Dragos analysts
responded to an Activity Group that harvested credentials from an IT
asset, and then leveraged a vulnerability in a VPN appliance to gain initial
access to the ICS environment. In this case, the adversary also used the
compromised credentials to move laterally in the ICS network and access
the critical assets.

A recurring theme from the previous Year in Review reports is the
disconnect between expectations and reality about air-gapped
systems. There was significant improvement in 2020 in this
area, with a two-thirds drop in the discovery of external routable
network connections to air-gapped ICS environments. During
one engagement, a client who believed their network to be airgapped had two external connections bypassing their architecture
and terminating deep within their gas transmission systems.
The purpose of the connections was to monitor gas quality and
heating values, and ensure exported product met demand and
quality specifications. Problematically, communications took place
directly between critical controllers used for the industrial process
and PLCs used only for data exchange with the remote connection.
This connection could have been leveraged by an adversary to
gain initial access to the network and move laterally across Level
1 systems within the Purdue model. Some systems in Level 1 had
communication pathways through network allowlists to Safety
Instrumented Systems (SIS) in the Safety Zone. Access to the
Safety Zone may be the goal of an adversary who intends to cause
a loss of safety impact, such as XENOTIME.

Cyber Readiness
In 2020, Dragos conducted several tabletop
exercises and incident response readiness
workshops. The findings and outcomes of these
engagements further illustrate the industry’s
deep-seated, over-reliance on prevention and
the necessity of strengthening the pillars of
a successful ICS cyber strategy; detection,
response, and recovery.
Dragos observed that 75 percent of clients did
not have clearly defined incident declaration
thresholds or categories of severity within
response plans. Detecting threat behaviors and
analyzing correlated datasets are generally the
first steps an organization takes to recognize
an incident. The threshold for declaring an
incident depends on many factors including
threats, tactics, operational risk requirements,
governing laws, and industry regulations.
Once incidents were declared, incident
managers were often observed by Dragos to
have no documented guidance or playbook
for how to employ resources or capabilities.
Nearly 60 percent of organizations did not
have a solidified Incident Response Plan (IRP).
Incident managers were often left to create
tactical response plans in real-time and in the
middle of rapid escalations. In 2020, Dragos
observed that 75 percent of 2020 clients did not
have clearly defined or documented incident
declaration thresholds or categories of severity
available during activation of their incident
response plans.

In 2020, 62 percent of Dragos client organizations
did not tie a dedicated communications plan to
their cybersecurity incident response activations.
This is a continuance of an industry trend from
2019. Communication plans are critical in enabling
incident managers and stakeholders to quickly
activate, assemble, and employ resources and
capabilities. During an incident, the need to react
appropriately is immediate, followed by the need
to communicate. Lack of effective communication
during a crisis can lead to inadequate resource
allocation, compound risks to assets and
personnel, and create lingering effects on bottomline operations. The periodic testing of IRPs can
act as a roadmap for corporate leadership to
convey strategic directives and objectives to an
incident response team. 100 percent of Dragos
exercise participants strongly agree that exercises
are beneficial to long-term incident response
preparation and are a valuable way to identify areas
of improvement for industrial cybersecurity IRPs.

Recommendations
As organizations strategize a path forward, Dragos recommends five key OT cybersecurity
initiatives to improve on in 2021 and beyond. These are based on the empirical evidence provided
throughout the report.
Dragos has included a graphic below each recommendation as a reference for asset owners
looking to implement the top five the recommendations of 2020. The recommendations listed
on the right are in descending order according to priority. Each recommendation has three or
more actions that may help asset owners achieve the desired goal of the recommendation. These
actions are numbered with the positive impact on that recommendation.

The top five recommendations to enhance the security of an ICS environment are:

Increase OT
Network Visibility
Visibility includes network monitoring, logging, and
maintaining a Collection Management Framework
(CMF).
Logging and monitoring of OT systems is essential
for detection and incident response in addition
to providing actionable data regarding device
performance, operation, and reliability. Network
traffic analysis should be prioritized based on the
considerations of the networks and their risks.

Identify and Prioritize
Crown Jewels

Crown Jewels are those assets that exercise control over the components
most critical to the safe operation of the industrial process. Examples include
HMIs, engineering and operator workstations, gateways, and controllers.
Prioritizing the assets that, if compromised, could cause major impacts to
the organization is key principle of risk management.
Example: At one facility, Instrumentation and Control (I&C) staff could
connect into the production network using a VPN. Once connected,
they utilized RDP to access their engineering laptop. Their laptops
had read/write permissions to any PLC in the Production Network,
including the crown jewel PLCs. Additionally, control staff left PLC
Run/Remote/Program key switches in remote mode meaning anyone
with network access could edit PLC configurations and logic. Lastly,
they did not have a mechanism to proactively detect changes to these
PLC configurations. In summary, a compromised I&C technician
account could modify PLC configurations and operations would not
detect it, until an operational issue or periodic maintenance occurred.
