According to info provided by Google's Project Zero team, four Android security
vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild as zero-day bugs before being patched earlier this
month.
Attacks attempting to exploit these flaws were targeted and impacted a limited number of
users based on information shared after this month's Android security updates were
published.
"There are indications that CVE-2021-1905, CVE-2021-1906, CVE-2021-28663 and CVE2021-28664 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," a recently updated version of the
May 2021 Android Security Bulletin reveals.

For 2021, we've surpassed the number of 0-days detected in-the-wild in all of 2020.

The four Android vulnerabilities impact Qualcomm GPU and Arm Mali GPU
Driver components.
Qualcomm and Arm have published further details on each vulnerability via security
advisories issued separately [1, 2].
Android users are recommended to install this month's security updates as soon as possible
if they are impacted by these issues.
CVEID

Impact

CVE20211905

Qualcomm - Use After Free in Graphics. Possible use after free due to improper
handling of memory mapping of multiple processes simultaneously.

CVE20211906

Qualcomm - Detection of Error Condition Without Action in Graphics. Improper
handling of address deregistration on failure can lead to new GPU address
allocation failure.

CVE202128663

ARM - Mali GPU Kernel Driver allows improper operations on GPU memory. A
non-privileged user can make improper operations on GPU memory to enter into
a use-after-free scenario and may be able to gain root privilege, and/or disclose
information.

CVE202128664

ARM - Mali GPU Kernel Driver elevates CPU RO pages to writable. A nonprivileged user can get a write access to read-only memory, and may be able to
gain root privilege, corrupt memory and modify the memory of other processes.

This month's Android security updates also include patches for critical vulnerabilities in the
System component that could be exploited by remote attackers using specially crafted files
to execute arbitrary malicious code within the context of a privileged process.
Regrettably, users who haven't switched to new devices that still receive monthly security
updates might not be able to install these patches.
To put things into perspective, more than 9% of all Android devices are still running Android
8.1 Oreo (released in December 2017), and roughly 19% Android Pie 9.0 (released in
August 2018), according to StatCounter data.

In December, Qualcomm also addressed a high severity security vulnerability in Mobile
Station Modem (MSM) chips (including the latest 5G-capable versions) that could allow
attackers to access smartphone users' text messages, call history, and listen in on their
conversations.
Last year, Qualcomm fixed more vulnerabilities impacting the Snapdragon chip Digital Signal
Processor (DSP) chip and enabling attackers to take control of smartphones without user
interaction and create unremovable malware that can evade detection.
Other bugs that could allow decrypting some WPA2-encrypted wireless network
packets, accessing critical data, and two flaws in the Snapdragon SoC WLAN firmware
allowing over the air compromise of the modem and the Android kernel were also patched
during the last two years.
