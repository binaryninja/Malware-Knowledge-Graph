Cyber-Espionage Campaign Targeting the Naval Industry
(“MartyMcFly”)

CERT-YOROI

October 17, 2018

Background
During the last week Yoroi CERT’s analysts uncovered several attacks targeting the
italian naval and defence industry. The attacker used email as known propagation vector
in order to infect victims by sending a special crafted xls file. The identified attack
properties triggered internal defcon escalation in order to assess the threat magnitude and
eventually special malware analyses according to the threat.
The suspicious emails have been intercepted between 9th and 15th October during our
common CSDC (Cyber Security Defence Center) operations in two different champains,
each one characterized by one or more attempts and slightly different social engineering
tricks.

Malicious Emails
The first intercepted malicious email had “markvanschaick.nl @qixnig .com” as a sender
address. The specific name has been likely chosen by the attacker to try to exploit the
Dutch marine service company reputation “Mark Van Schaick”, but sender’s domain and ip
address shown no direct relationship to that organisation.

The message has been sent from a
Roundcube webmail server hosted on lord.
vivawebhost .com (173.237.190.12 COLO4-BLK7 US) and apparently unrelated to the
sender’s domain. Moreover, “qixnig .com” (sender domain name) resolves to a different
IP address reachable at 66.45.243.148 (INTERSERVER US). It’s interesting to figure out
the crafted redirection applied to any visiting users: a HTTP 301 code redirecting to the
Dan Marine Group’s official web portal.

The second email campaign was slightly different respect to the first one. It was
originated by another Roundcube webmail service hosted at mail.dbweb .se (52.58.78.16
AT-88-Z US):

Figure 3. SMTP header details of wave 2
In this case the fake communication process
mimics the interaction between “Naviera Ulises Ltd <supplie@ulisnav.gr>” and “Evripidis
Mareskas (Mr) <supplies.ulisnav @ kiramko .com>”. The extracted domain r happens to be
“kiramko .com” and it resolved to the same remote ip address discovered in the first
campaign wave (“qixnig .com”, 66.45.243.148 INTERSERVER US). Those campaigns could
be considered as closely correlated. The “ulisnav .gr” appears to be unregistered at time
of writing.
The intercepted emails come up with a carefully prepared phishing scheme, definitely
targeting the italian naval sector. The observed chunks of headers and the network
context shown the attacker tried to impersonate known vendors of marine parts and naval
services in order to lure victims to open up the attached documents.
For example the first two detected
attempts tried to mimic inquiries from
the Chinese Dan Marine Group,
pretending to validate the sender’s
domain “qixnig .com” as legibly owned
by the group. It then tried to redirect
visitors to the Dan Marine official website. Another intercepted email inserted the victim
as BCC into a fake communication between the tech support of the greek Naviera Ulises
Ltd and one of its employer (data publicly available on linkedin).
No one of these communications appear to be real and legitim, indeed the intercepted
data does not suggest the attacker has any kind of access to real assets.

Attachments
The intercepted email messages have more than one attached documents: on the first
email campaign we observed two copies of the same Excel file
(5c947b48e737648118288cb04d2abd7b) wrapping CDFV2 encrypted data and scoring
relatively low in the VT’s AV coverage test (9/59 at time of writing).

2/7

This document is able to download an executable payload
(66b239615333c3eefb8d4bfb9999291e) from a compromised web portal:

Further details regarding the evasion techniques, especially related to the
“VelvetSweatshop” trick and the Equation Editor’s exploit used to drop the malware, are
available here (link).

Figure 5. Malicious excel document
The second attack had as attachment a copy of Excel file and one more PDF document
named “Company profile.pdf” (6d2fc17061c942a6fa5b43c285332251), this file appears
to have been generated in the same time-period of the phishing attempts: nearly 30
minutes before the dispatch of the malicious message, from a MS Word 2013 document.

The embedded attachments have been delivered
in the middle of October using multiple names,
most of them related to the naval industry and
containing references to quotations, inquiry or
orders of mechanical parts.

Figure 7. Submission time and names of the samples
Having said that, we can now explain the internal choice of the “MartyMcFly” code-name
for this campaign: the name comes from the “First Seen in The Wild ” value reported by the
VT platform and the meta-data found in the artifacts, which are a quite interesting topic to
be discussed.

Payload
The executable payload has been downloaded from a
potentially compromised website legitimately owned by a
turkish company selling mechanical spare parts, indicating
the attacker had carefully taken care of the thematization
of the malware distribution infrastructure.
The PE32 file 66b239615333c3eefb8d4bfb9999291e contains executable binary code
compiled from Delphi source code (BobSoft Mini Delphi).
The first stage of execution shows several anti-analysis patterns and tricks, for instance
at 0x0045e304 the malware checks if the year of the local time configured in the OS is
after 2017 (rif. Figure 8) moreover at 0x045e393 it slows down the execution invoking the
SleepEx library function (rif. Figure 9).

The bypass of all the debug checks and evasion tricks inside the malicious code leads to
the dynamic loading of a .NET module in a RWX code-segment mapped at the
0x012e0000 location.

Figure 10. Executable module unpacked in memory
Yara signatures claim the extracted PE32 module is attributable to a weaponized version
of “QuasarRAT”: an open-source remote administration tool freely available on github.

.NET Modules
The manual verification reported in Figure 12
confirms the extracted payload is compatible with
QuasarRAT modules published on the github
repository. Moreover, the IoC section below
reports the C2 server locations found in the
malware configurations.

At the moment no attribution to known group is possible, many threat actor choose to use
or customize open-source tools to try to make the attribution harder, such as the chinese
“Stone Panda” group (APT-10) known for espionage operations against defence and
government, having the QuasarRAT in their arsenal, or also the “Gorgon Group”, the
ambiguous mercenary group responsible of both cyber-crime attacks and targeted
espionage campaigns against governments.
