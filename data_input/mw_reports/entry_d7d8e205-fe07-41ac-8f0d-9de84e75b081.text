Wed 11 December 2019 in Ransomware
I first read about this strain on Twitter but it didn't seem like a big thing. Turns out I Was
wrong: In the last 3 days I collected over 35 samples :O

Searching for "Project.exe" on AnyRun yields more than a healthy list of results all matching
this strain.

Oh would you look at that: Looks like we have a Borland Delphi application here

🧐

Yep, it's that ugly it definitely is Deplhi :D And the criminals seem to have a very strong
opinion about the Land of the Free but no arguments to back it up (since the rest of the form
is empty).

The other strain uses a similar Form Window but actually displays its name in there (but they
saved on the Window Title).

MZ Revenge and MaMo add these extensions to encrypted files respectively: .MZ173801
and .MaMo434376. It seems to drop the Ransomnotes into the Library Folders, once into
%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent and into the root of every (unmounted) storage
device.

TIL: The MZP Magic tells you that the PE was built in Pascal. Therefore the error message is
different as well, normally you would expect to see This program cannot be run in DOS
mode here.

Because loading a Delphi executable into IDA or Ghidra can be very painful to look at I'll try
out a tool I haven't used before. It is called "Interactive Delphi Reconstructor" (IDR in short)
and the setup is trivial. Just clone the Git Repository and download the Knowledge Base files
linked at the bottom and extract + paste them into the source folder.
For those playing along at home it should look something like this after the auto-analysis
finished:

Looking at the Strings tab I noticed this weird GUID {43826d1e-e718-42ee-bc55a1e261c37bfe}. I'll have to investigate further to say for sure, but looking at this Document for
the CIA Vault7 Leaks this might be part of an UAC bypass.
I also grabbed the extension list the ransomware uses. It will target the following extensions:
.txt;.doc;.docx;.intex;.pdf;.zip;.rar;.onetoc;.css;.lnk;.xlsx;.ppt;.pptx;.odt;.jpg;.bm
zip;.ace;.arj;.bz2;.myi;.cab;.gzip;.lzh;.tar;.uue;.xz;.z;.001;.mpg;.odg;.core;.crproj;

As suspected by @Hildakrypt on Twitter the creators of the turkish KesLan Ransomware
might also have built MZ Revenge / MaMo.

Update 15.12.2019:
A new Version of this strain was found to be appending .aes to encrypted files. This time
there is no ransomnote though, so let's see if this is a malfunction or intentional.
The Any.Run Analysis can be found here.
Visually this sample resembles the look of the "MZ Revenge 1.0" strain with an empty Form
and the red DX icon.
