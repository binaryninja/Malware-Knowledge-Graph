Impact
With .5 illion people uing Window ever da, and
.2 illion people with O ce product intalled on
their machine, the “pla the odd” approach egin
to explain the popularit of Microoft product with
Ruian APT.
Popular Java (ued  89% of U.. computer) and
Adoe (50 illion PDF opened in Adoe in 20 5)
exploit follow thi pattern. Much like with cer
criminal, the path of leat reitance to a ucceful
redirection or implant i often the et for a tateponored actor targeting trategic information.

Conduct enterprie we and email ecurit

Utilize two-factor authentication and VPN
where appropriate.
