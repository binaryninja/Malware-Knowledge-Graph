Working with Intelligence Analysts as well as SOC teams over many years has led us to
identify pain points that just seemed solvable with a little thought. A couple of these can be
helped enormously by “Infra-Tagging”. It’s a new term so just go with it for now while I
explain.
The problem: I’m looking at a bunch of domains and want to see how they are related.
There are many different ways to do this and each involves numerous look-ups and then
saving the results to compare them.
This is where Infra Tagging steps in. We just do one API call for each domain to generate
an Infra-tag. The tag will be of the form {mx.ns.as.reg} where MX= the domain portion of the
first mail exchange record in DNS, NS= the domain portion of the top last seen Name
Server, AS= the AS name of the assigned IP address of the A record, Reg- the registrar
mentioned in Whois if available. If any field is unavailable it is replaced with a _.

This results in something like the below
Example 1
API
https://api.silentpush.com/api/v1/merge-api/explore/domain/infratag/zicanotes[.]com
Result
"tag": "_:dns.com:cnservers:key-systemsgmbh"
Example 2
So lets try this for a particular bunch of domains from a related campaign.
"domain": "dimetriadit[.]top", "tag": "_:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc"
"domain": "glooverdoover[.]top", "tag": "porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc"
"domain": "sillkolo[.]space", "tag": "porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:_"
"domain": "woodabeg[.]fun", "tag": "porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc"
These domains are related to IcedID infrastructure
Having this tag alongside each domain in your security tools is very useful as any analyst
has a chance of being able to spot trends with a glance.
However there are even greater advantages such as being able to search for tags in data.
That means we can do this in a couple of places.
1. Search for similar tags in threat feeds and see which items may be related.
2. Search in Passive/Active DNS to see what else is out there with the same Infra-Tag
and similar
