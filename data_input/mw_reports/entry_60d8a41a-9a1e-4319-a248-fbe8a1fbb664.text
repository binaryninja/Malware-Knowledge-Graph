A ransomware group attacking large organizations with malware called BlackCat has
followed a consistent pattern over the past several months: The threat actors break in to
enterprise networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched or outdated firewall/VPN
devices, then pivot to internal systems after establishing a foothold from the firewall.
Since December 2021, Sophos has been called in to investigate at least five attacks
involving this ransomware. In two of the cases, the attackers made their initial access to the
target’s network by exploiting a vulnerability that was first disclosed in 2018 and affected a
particular firewall vendor’s product. In two others, the attackers targeted a different firewall
vendor’s product with a vulnerability that was disclosed last year.
In all but one of the incidents we investigated, the vulnerabilities permitted the attackers to
obtain VPN credentials from memory on the firewall devices, which they could then use to
log in to the VPN as if they were an authorized user. None of the targets used multifactor
authentication for these VPNs. The one outlier appears to have been a spearphishing attack
that revealed an internal user’s VPN login credentials to the attackers.

Once inside the network, the attackers predominantly used RDP to move laterally between
computers, conducting brute-force attacks over the VPN connection against the
Administrator account on machines inside the network. The ransomware executable has
functionality to spread itself laterally to Windows machines, as well as specific capabilities
designed to target VMware ESXi hypervisor servers.

In one case, when Sophos incident responders removed the compromised VPN accounts
from the firewall and created new username/password combinations, the attacker just ran
the same exploit a second time and was able to extract newly created passwords that were
being used in the incident response, and carry on attempting to encrypt machines.

Wide Range of Remote Access Tools
Once they had gained a foothold on an internal computer, the attackers installed various
remote access utilities to give themselves backup methods of remotely connecting to the
targets’ networks. Attackers used the commercial tools AnyDesk and TeamViewer, and also
installed a remote access tool called ngrok.

tool AnyDesk on targeted systems, and assign a password of Password123X** to the client
The attackers also used PowerShell commands to download and execute Cobalt Strike
beacons on some machines, and a tool called Brute Ratel, which is a more recent
pentesting suite with Cobalt Strike-like remote access features. The attackers had installed
the Brute Ratel binary as a Windows service named wewe on at least one affected machine.

Investigating the ransomware cases were complicated by the fact that some of the targeted
organizations were running servers that had previously been compromised using the Log4j
vulnerability; Some servers were discovered to have been running a variety of cryptominers
and other nuisance malware that were unrelated to the ransomware incident.
Complicating the analysis, the ransomware binary itself requires that whoever deploys it
adds an “access token” (a 64-byte hexadecimal string) to the command line that launches
the executable, or else it won’t run. During test executions of the ransomware, it engages in
an attempt to discover Windows network shares and copy itself to those locations. When run
in a Windows virtual machine, the ransomware mounted several shares as new drive letters
and duplicated itself to the root of those drives.
In addition to ransoming computers on the network, the threat actors spent some time
searching around for, collecting, and then exfiltrating large volumes of sensitive data from the
targets, uploading them to the cloud storage provider Mega. The attackers used a third-party
tool called DirLister to create a list of accessible directories and files, or in some cases used
a PowerShell script from a pentester toolkit, called PowerView.ps1, to enumerate the
machines on the network, and in some cases they used a tool called LaZagne to extract
passwords saved on various devices.
Once the attackers had collected the files they planned to exfiltrate, they used the WinRAR
compression utility to compress the files into .rar archives. They used a tool called rsync to
upload the stolen data from some networks, but also used Mega’s own MEGASync
software, or in some cases, just the Chrome browser.

During the data collection process, the attackers ran various PowerShell scripts that could
find and extract saved credentials. For instance, an attacker in the February attack left
behind a file named Veeam-Get-Creds.ps1, which can extract saved passwords used by
Veeam software to connect to remote hosts.
Aside from the abuse of vulnerable firewalls as a point of entry, and the fact the targets had
lots of vulnerable machines inside their network, there weren’t any consistent characteristics
of the victims who were attacked. Two of the targeted companies are based in Asia, one in
Europe. The industry segment in which each of the targets do business is distinct from the
others.

Getting Inside Was the Easy Part
The initial break-ins in each case took place before the target engaged Sophos for incident
response. In the earliest case, where we began working with the target in early December,
we found evidence that the attackers had penetrated the network as much as a month prior
to when we began the investigation and had installed cryptominer software on 16 servers
inside the company network in early November.

The BlackCat ransom note
The attackers in this incident (and in several others as well) dumped the LSASS password
store to obtain valid credentials on a domain controller, then used those to create a new
account with administrative privileges. The attackers ran a tool called netscan_portable.exe

to find additional targets, then used that newly created account to RDP from machine to
machine within the network.
In an attack that took place in February, the attackers had previously exploited the VPN
vulnerability to obtain valid credentials, then used them to log in to the enterprise network.
Five days after obtaining the VPN credentials, the attackers connected to the VPN and
conducted a brute-force password spray attack against a domain controller. They then
created a new domain admin account, installed AnyDesk on the DC (presumably as a
backup), and used RDP to pivot from machine to machine.
The attackers also installed a tool called rclone, which Sophos has observed other threat
actors using to upload data to cloud storage providers. Two weeks after that initial flurry of
activity, the attacker installed a second data uploading tool, MEGASync, from another user’s
compromised account, and began to exfiltrate sensitive data. This suggests that the attacker
uploaded data more than once, from two or more servers, using at least these two methods.
In an attack that took place in March, our analysts discovered that the BlackCat attackers
had run through a similar game plan to the prior attacks: They exploited a firewall
vulnerability, gained remote access through the VPN, and then pivoted internally to target
domain controllers and other servers. The team found evidence of Cobalt Strike
beacons/Brute Ratel executables, scripts for performing reconnaissance, and evidence of
staging data for exfiltration, but no evidence that it had been uploaded anywhere.

Custom Malware for Each Target
As seems to be commonplace in ransomware attacks in 2022, the attackers crafted a
custom ransomware binary for each target. The executable contained the ransom note
customized to each targeted organization with a link to the BlackCat TOR server where the
threat actors would publish examples of stolen data.
The ransomware, when executed, appended a seven-letter file suffix to every encrypted file.
The suffix was unique to each targeted organization, applied consistently wherever the
attackers could opportunistically launch it.
The attack in December 2021 mainly targeted ESXi servers and encrypted the virtual hard
disks for VMs hosted in the hypervisor, rendering those machines inaccessible. During the
investigation, Sophos found that more than half the organization’s computers were running
Windows 7, for which Microsoft ended support in January 2020.

IIS, Microsoft’s web service
As in the December attack, the attack that took place in March also involved hypervisors:
The attackers targeted a Hyper-V server and encrypted the virtual disk files for VMs running
on that server. But that attack also targeted desktops and laptops as widely as possible on
the enterprise network. The attack in February targeted both servers and other endpoints. An
attack that took place in May involved a Citrix server.

Environmental Issues
We found significant number of systems that had fallen outside of the availability of security
patches. The networks at each target were flat, with every machine able to see every other
machine in the network – something that made it extremely easy for the attackers to scan for
and identify targets of greatest value. Segregating portions of the network from one another
using VLANs would have helped.
The firewall bugs were old, and there was evidence that VPN credentials for one of the
firewalls had been leaked in a public distribution of VPN username/password combinations
several years ago. Had the target applied the available patches to those firewalls in a more
timely manner, things would have been much more complicated for the attackers.
None of the targets were using multifactor authentication for their VPN logins, which would
have stopped the attackers cold.
Firewall and user account permissions that provide the least-possible access would also
have gone a long way to limiting the damage from the attackers.
The presence of ngrok, a legitimate remote-access tool often abused by attackers, could
also have provided an alert to watchful sysadmins. Sophos has an incident response
playbook available for those looking to understand how ngrok is abused in cases such as
this and how ngrok misuse can be investigated and mitigated on the network.
