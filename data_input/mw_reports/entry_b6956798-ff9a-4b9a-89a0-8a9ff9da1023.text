Digital Skeleton Key Bypasses Security Measures
2019 was an excellent year for the Taiwan superconductor industry; however, beneath this
economic upturn, a digital chimera was slowly eating at it from within. Throughout 2019,
multiple companies in the Taiwan high-tech ecosystem were victims of an advanced
persistent threat (APT) attack.
“Taiwan is set to become the largest and fastest-growing semiconductor equipment
maker in the world by increasing by 21.1 percent to reach US$12.31 billion.”
-Taiwan News, July 2019
1/15

APTs are professional cyber espionage actors that typically receive direction and support
from nation-states and often target organizations (orgs) with high-value information, such as
national defense, financial, energy, or manufacturing.
Due to these APT attacks having similar behavior profiles (similar adversarial techniques,
tactics, and procedures or TTP) with each other and previously documented cyberattacks,
we assess with high confidence these new attacks were conducted by the same foreign
threat actor.
During our investigation, we dubbed this threat actor Chimera. “Chimera” stands for the
synthesis of hacker tools that we’ve seen the group use, such as the skeleton key malware
that contained code extracted from both Dumpert and Mimikatz — hence Chimera.
Their operation — the entirety of the new attacks utilizing the Skeleton Key attack (described
below) from late 2018 to late 2019, we have dubbed Operation Skeleton Key.
The main objective of these attacks was the exfiltration of intellectual property, such as
documents on integrated circuits (IC), software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, source
code, etc.
The motive behind these attacks likely stems from competitors (or possibly even nationstates due to the advanced nature of the attacks) seeking to gain a competitive advantage.

Highlighted Findings
In our above report, we go over our comprehensive analysis of the techniques, tactics,
procedures, and customized malware employed by Chimera. Here are some highlighted
findings from our research.
1. — This malware contained code extracted from both Dumpert and Mimikatz and was
used as an account manipulation tool. The malware altered the (NTLM) authentication
program and implanted a skeleton key to allow the attackers to log in without the need
of a valid credential. Once the code in memory was altered, the attackers could still
gain access to compromised machines even after resetting passwords. The attackers
then used the skeleton key to freely to other machines in the same domain. There was
no difference when compared to legit login activity, nor was legit user login activity
hindered. These factors helped mask the attacker’s persistent malicious activities.
2. — The attackers utilized as their main (RAT). The mutated backdoor replaced and then
masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update to confuse users. In order to further mask
the malicious activity and make attribution difficult for defenders, the attackers placed
most of the command-and-control (C2) servers in the Google Cloud Platform.
3. — used an old and patched version of RAR modified for data exfiltration.

The Skeleton Key: A Brief History
2/15

In 2014, Dell Secureworks Counter Threat Unit observed the earliest use of a digital skeleton
key. Their observed skeleton key was able to bypass authentication on Active Directory (AD)
systems implementing single-factor verification, giving them unfettered access to remote
access services.
However, Chimera also added extracted key code snippets from Mimikatz and Dumpert to
their skeleton key. The Chimera skeleton key sought to bypass API monitoring, which is
widely used in anti-virus and EDR products, by directly invoking syscalls and implementing
high-level API logic.

The Investigations
We thoroughly analyzed more than 30,000 endpoints belonging to multiple companies along
the Taiwan high-tech ecosystem supply chain, during our investigation into Operation
Skeleton Key. Two representative cases are chosen here for more in-depth sharing.
We summarized our year-long findings into two kinds of cases, we call them Case A and
Case B, representing two different approaches: discovering Operation Skeleton Key during
regular security operations vs. discovering the aftermath of Chimera’s attacks during incident
response (IR).

CyCraft MDR Services
Step 1: We deploy our MDR+NGAV scanner to your endpoints.
Step 2: We continuously receive the scanner data
Step 3: Our AI and security experts analyze it and generate alerts & reports, including
complete site-wide UEBA, threat analysis, MITRE ATT&CK® classification, storylines
of all malicious behavior and remediation options.
At the time of detection, CyCraft had already been providing Case A orgs with our MDR
packages.
3/15

While our active detection package consists of our 24/7 MDR service, our passive detection
package (which the representative Case A org here had opted for at the time) includes
intervaled (in this case, daily) detection reports across all endpoints and network; endpoints
are scanned for known malicious behavior and suspicious behavior that could suggest an
attack, which is what happened here.
We have picked this representative sample from Case A as we could see more details of the
tactics, techniques, and procedures used in Operation Skeleton Key. Case A customers who
used our more active MDR package did not experience the depth of penetration that this
representative sample did.
By contrast, orgs in Case B approached CyCraft for our IR services after they detected the
abnormal activity on their system.
Cyber situation graphs and storylines have been provided; however, note that all server and
user names are de-identified and replaced with aliases.

A Representative Sample From Case A Organizations

In the first hours of the attack, Chimera had not attacked or compromised a vital server. It
was decided to allow the threat actor to temporarily persist in order to gain more intelligence
into their new malware, behavior, and motivations.
4/15

Upon the initial detection of suspicious activity of endpoint NB-CLAIR, in this representative
sample of Case A, their security operations center (SOC) was immediately notified of the
suspicious behavior and the potential danger to their system. Had the Case A org been
subscribed to our 24/7 MDR service, we could have easily stopped the attack at NB-CLAIR.
Chimera’s initial access came from a valid ID from a virtual private network (VPN).
Many enterprises often neglect this attack vector, by default trusting VPN connections and
welcoming them into their intranet; and Chimera is one of the most skilled threat actors that
we have seen at abusing VPN policies. A remote desktop protocol (RDP) was used to gain
access to NB-CLAIR, where the first Cobalt Strike backdoor was placed.
Cobalt Strike was used as Chimera’s main RAT tool. In an attempt to avoid detection, the
RAT replaced the original Google Update binary and functioned as a mutated Cobalt Strike
beacon to inject payloads into other processes.
This behavior, as you can imagine, was extremely suspicious. At the time of detection, no
information could be found on this particular malware on VirusTotal (VT);our AI immediately
began closely tracking the attack.

Six minutes after RDP was used to gain access to NB-CLAIR, Cobalt Strike was then
remotely copied to Server-LAUREN via the schtasks utility. At this point, had our continuous
MDR services (active detection) been employed, agents (installed on both the NB-CLAIR
endpoint and Server-LAUREN) would have detected the lateral movement and have been
able to halt the attack.

5/15

The malware, GoogleUpdate.exe, in an attempt to make tracking difficult, connected to C2
servers located in the Google Cloud Platform; however, this was detected by our continuous
digital forensics platform. The Case A org’s SOC was again immediately notified.

At this time, only 18 minutes had passed since Chimera’s initial access. Once connected to
the C2 servers, RecordedTV.ms was dropped onto Server-LAUREN to archive data for
exfiltration. Even without the .exe file extension, data exfiltration could still have been
executed.
RecordedTV.ms was later discovered to be a modified version of RAR; however, it had a
one-byte discrepancy from the original version (specifically rar.exe v3.6). Our platform was
not only able to detect the injected file but was also able to detect this one-byte discrepancy
and flag it.

Left: Original rar.exe, Right: RecordedTV.ms with the patched byte
Identical binaries were found in several machines, but under different names, e.g.,
RecordedTV.ms, uncheck.dmp, jucheck.exe. This too was detected by our AI-driven
forensics, and Case A SOCs were again notified of the suspicious behavior.
Several “net user” commands were also executed from Server-LAUREN for recon purposes,
and the results were saved to the RecordedTV_lib.log. Server-LAUREN also used wmic to
remotely execute various commands in another endpoint to check if there was an Internet
connection, which we flag as discovery events under the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.

6/15

Server-LAUREN also stored the Windows Registry and ntds.dit of other hosts. The active
directory (AD) database, ntsa.dit, contained information about domain hosts and users, such
as IDs, names, and password hashes.
The registry contained the key for the encrypted ntds.dit AD database. Chimera needed to
archive both in order to remotely decrypt the file and, most likely, bruteforce the password
hash.
Once the active directory (AD) server had been compromised, the SkeletonKeyInjector
malware, d3dll.dll, was used to implant a skeleton key so the attacker could freely perform
lateral movement (LM) to other machines in the same domain.
Thankfully, this incident was taken care of before the SkeletonKeyInjector was allowed to run
amuck; Case B orgs were not so fortunate.
As with all our customers, Case A orgs received a fully actionable report with
contextual information. Their complete site analysis included the full context behind the
high-severity alerts that were previously sent and provided actionable intelligence
covering their endpoints, processes, files, identity and access management (IAM), and
network.
7/15

With automated forensic investigations, we were able to replace guesswork with actionable
steps to halt the attack and recover the systems involved.
The Case A org’s actionable report informed them which processes to stop, which files to
delete, which malware to remove, which user accounts were infected and needed resetting,
and which URLs, IP addresses, and domains to block.
The representative org used for parts of Case A who used our passive detection has since
upgraded to our active detection services and now enjoys the benefits and confidence
provided by our MDR service.

SkeletonKeyInjector
This particular malware was an account manipulation tool that altered the NTLM
authentication program and implanted a skeleton key that allowed Chimera to log in without
valid credentials to other machines.
After the code in memory was altered, Chimera would be able to gain access to any system
in the domain. As AD machines are rarely rebooted, Chimera could potentially control
machines for a very long time without detection.
This is one of many reasons why CyCraft performs memory forensics on all computers,
including domain controllers.
8/15

During our investigation of Operation Skeleton Key, we discovered some semiconductor
vendors were employing a white-list enforcement approach. Although this is a feasible
approach, as the AD cannot execute any software outside the white-list, our investigation
showed that Chimera was still able to use Living off the Land Binaries (LOL) bins to launch
attacks.

Case B

9/15

A sample Case B attack storyline, from 19:53 on Nov. 7, 2018 to 10:56 on Dec. 27, 2019
In November of 2019, while a representative Case B org was upgrading their network
infrastructure, several abnormal activities were discovered. CyCraft was tasked by the org to
conduct an investigation via our IR services, as in this scenario, CyCraft solution was not
part of their daily SecOps.

CyCraft IR Services
Step 1: We deploy our IR forensic scanner to your endpoints.
Step 2: We receive the scanner data; our AI and security experts analyze it.
Step 3: In under 24 hours after our scanner runs, we walk you through your
eradication plan, including complete site-wide hacker tools and behavior analysis.
Step 4: Together, we rescan and confirm eradication.
After running our scanner on Case B orgs’ endpoints, we immediately discovered that the
behavior profile of the cyberattack resembled Operation Skeleton Key.
Both of the sophisticated attacks targeting Case A and Case B orgs utilized the
SkeletonKeyInjector, the Cobalt Strike RAT masquerading as a Google Update, and had a
similar behavior profile (similar usage of TTP) with the other cases we investigated. These
factors led us to attribute all of these attacks to the same threat actor and operation.
However, unlike in Case A orgs, it was apparent that these types of intrusions had persisted
for a substantial time, in some samples, well over a year. There were other differences, as
well.
Unlike Case A, Chimera widely used encoded PowerShell scripts (seen below). In order to
avoid the file-based detection mechanisms, the payload was injected directly into the system
memory.
The injected malware, our old friend the Cobalt Strike backdoor, was discovered in multiple
endpoints, which unsurprisingly included two domain controllers. Most infected hosts had the
Cobalt Strike malware implanted in their svchost.exe. The Cobalt Strike backdoor was used
for process migration to other system processes.

10/15

Similar to Case A, legal cloud services were widely used by Chimera to house their C2
servers in an attempt to avoid threat attribution. Once again, RAR programs with seemingly
innocuous file names (RecoredTV.ms, jucheck.exe, vmware.log) were used to archive data
for exfiltration.
Chimera was successful in archiving the passwords and using a DLL file (d3d11.dll) to
deploy the skeleton key malware. With the Skeleton Key deployed, each machine on the
domain could then be freely accessed by Chimera.
The ultimate motivation of Chimera was the acquisition of intellectual property, i.e., IC
documents, SDKs, source code, etc.

After collaborating with Case B orgs on the execution of our eradication plan, all of the
malware and system damage caused by Chimera was remediated in record time.
To ensure the security of the system during the execution of the eradication plan and the
system hardening that followed, CyCraft offered Case B orgs (as we do with all customers of
our IR services) three months of free MDR services.
After the initial three months of MDR services, Case B orgs decided to continue enjoying the
confidence our MDR services provide.

UPDATE: Chimera Observed in EU?
On 12 January 2020, Fox-IT & NCC Group published their detailed report, “Abusing Cloud
Services to Fly Under the Radar”. The threat actor tracked in their report shared many
similarities to the China-linked threat actor Chimera, whom CyCraft attributed to a year-long
cyberattack targeting the Taiwan semiconductor industry just last year.
Much like Chimera, the threat actor mentioned in the Fox-IT & NCC Group report (referred to
in this article as CUTR, Chimera Under the Radar) targeted intellectual property (IP) from the
semiconductor industry; however, the report goes into further detail explaining how their
threat actor’s targets were more diverse, including targeting sensitive data from the EU
aviation industry.
