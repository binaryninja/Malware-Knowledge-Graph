A Deep-dive Analysis of KARMA Ransomware

August 24, 2021

While performing our routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, Cyble Research Labs came
across a ransomware group known as KARMA, which encrypts files on the victim’s machine and
appends the extension of encrypted files to .KARMA. Subsequently, the Threat Actors
(TAs) demand that the victims pay ransom for the private key to recover their data.
Based on analysis by Cyble Research Labs, we have observed that the executable payload is a consolebased application.
Figure 1 shows the execution flow of the Karma ransomware. After execution, the malware takes
inputs from the user and checks all A-Z drives, excludes folders and files from encryption. After this, the
ransomware proceeds to drop the ransom note and replaces the original content with encrypted
content. It then appends the extension as .KARMA.

Technical Analysis
Our static analysis found that the malware is a console-based x86 architecture executable written in
C/C++, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Malware Payload Static Information
After encrypting the files, the ransomware payload drops the ransom note named KARMAENCRYPTED.txt in various places in the victim’s machine, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Ransom Note
In the above ransom note, the TAs have given email support
IDs ” JamesHoopkins1988@onionmail[.]org“, Leslydown1988@tutanota[.]com“, “

ollivergreen1977@protonmail[.]com“. The victims are asked to reach out to the attackers and pay the
ransom amount in Bitcoin (BTC) to get the private decryption key.
After execution, the malware encrypts the files and appends the extension of encrypted
files as .KARMA and drops ransom note as shown in Figure 4.

Files
Upon execution, a Mutex with the name KARMA is createdto ensure that only one instance
of this ransomware is running at a time, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Malware Creates Mutex

The malware payload uses the crypt32.dll library, a module used to implement certificate
and cryptographic messaging functions in the CryptoAPI, as shown below.

Figure 6 Malware Loads Library crypt32.dll

As shown in Figure 7, the malware payload first gets the command-line string and checks if the argument
is less or equal to 1. It then creates threads depending on the logical drive present in the victim
machine.
If the argument is greater than 1, the malware checks whether the passed argument is a directory.
If a directory is found, the payload encrypts the directory and its content. Furthermore, if the argument is
for any specific file, the malware will start encrypting that file as well.

Figure 7 Malware Encryption Process
The malware payload iterates through all possible A-Z drives on the Windows machine and verifies if the
drives are logical, after which it creates a thread. Refer to Figure 8.

Figure 10 Malware Excludes Files from Encryption
The malware initially searches for folders, for example, config.Msi in C drive. If it can successfully locate
these folders, it performs further actions, as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Malware Searches for the Folder
After finding the required folders, the malware creates the ransom note, as shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Malware Writes Ransom Note
As seen in Figure 13, the malware generates a seed after creating the ransom note.

Figure 13 Malware Generates Seed
The malware reads the content and writes encrypted data, as shown in Figure 14.

Figure 15 Encryption Routine
After encrypting the files, the malware replaces the original content with encrypted content with appended
extension as .KARMA, as shown in Figure 16.

The TOR website hxxp://3nvzqyo6l4wkrzumzu5aod7zbosq4ipgf7ifgj3hsvbcr5vcasordvqd[.]onion/shown in
Figure 17 was present in the ransom note, in the contact section of the website, TAs have
mentioned two email IDs jeffreyclinton1977@onionmail.org and jackiesmith176@protonmail.com,
which the victims can use to communicate with them to recover the data

Conclusion
Ransomware groups continue to pose a severe threat to firms and individuals. Organizations need to
stay ahead of the techniques used by TAs, besides implementing the requisite security best practices
and security controls.
Ransomware victims are at risk of losing valuable data as a result of such attacks, resulting in financial
loss and lost productivity. In the event that the victim is unable or unwilling to pay the ransom, the TA may
leak or sell this data online. This will not only compromise sensitive user data in the case of banks, online
shopping portals etc, but it will also lead to a loss of reputation for the affected firm.
Cyble Research Lab is continuously monitoring KARMA’s extortion campaign and will keep our readers
up to date with new information.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow these suggestions given below:
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or on a separate network.
Regularly perform the vulnerability assessment of the organizational assets majorly which are
exposed on internet.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
Avoid using software cracks or keygens from torrent or third-party servers.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
