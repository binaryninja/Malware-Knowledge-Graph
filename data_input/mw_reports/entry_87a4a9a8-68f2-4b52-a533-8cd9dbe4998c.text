AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

FOREWORD
The impact of cybercrime is far-reaching and extends
beyond national boundaries. Coupled with increased
reliance on online activities during the COVID-19
pandemic, it poses a formidable challenge to security
worldwide. What exacerbates the situation is the ‘gap’
in law enforcement cyber capabilities within and across
regions. This gap is a key enabler for criminal
opportunities, networks and infrastructure.
In recognition of this challenge, INTERPOL is supporting
its 194 member countries in enhancing their law
enforcement capabilities and capacity to combat
cybercrime. INTERPOL offers a number of tools,
platforms and operational support, with a view to connecting police and creating a safer world. In
particular, INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme has been pivotal in leading the global law
enforcement response against cybercrime.
Partnership has been at the heart of these efforts. Collaboration with the various actors in the global
cybersecurity ecosystem is crucial. Their diverse views, expertise and datasets can help shape
effective policies and operational responses to cybercrime. Partnership also allows us to pool our
wisdom so we can be resilient and agile in times of uncertainty.
Leveraging this partnership framework, INTERPOL takes a regional approach to operational
coordination in combating cybercrime. Although cybercrime is a global challenge, every region
responds differently. By understanding how the threats are evolving and what kind of harm they are
causing in each region, we can defeat them more effectively.
With this in mind, INTERPOL has drawn up this African Cyberthreat Assessment Report for member
countries in Africa. The aim is to accurately assess the threat landscape so as to be able to provide
tailored support. The report was produced under the aegis of the African Joint Operation against
Cybercrime (AFJOC) with support from the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and
Development Office.
Looking ahead, the newly-created African Cybercrime Operations Desk under the AFJOC project will
drive intelligence-led, coordinated actions against cybercrime and its perpetrators in African
member countries based on this threat assessment. To effectively support the region, INTERPOL also
works closely with key regional organizations such as the African Union and Afripol to maximize
coordination and implementation efforts in order to boost regional capabilities and capacity in the
fight against cybercrime.
I trust that this report will help close the gaps within Africa and beyond, and contribute to the
effectiveness of the global law enforcement response. We thank the member countries in Africa and
our partners for their strong commitment in this endeavour.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

FOREWORD
The African continent has huge potential in terms of information
and communication technologies, especially because of the
youth of its population. Indeed, about 60% of the African
population in 2020 is under 25 years old. This factor is driving
strong growth in the use of new technologies.
However, we are also witnessing an upsurge in activities related
to Cybercrime, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic period. The
loss of jobs related to this pandemic and the low economic
growth recorded has opened up opportunities for criminal
organizations. Hence the special attention that the African Union
Commission is paying to the fight against all forms of organized
crime: money laundering, transnational crime and cybercrime.
In terms of Internet coverage capacity and bandwidth speed, Africa remains under-served, especially
in rural areas, yet it has the fastest-growing telephone and Internet networks in the world. On this
young continent, every economic challenge generates an innovative solution that may sometimes,
unfortunately, be at the limit of what the law allows. For example, the low rate of banking facilities
for African populations has led to the creation of new financial services such as mobile banking, but
also to the resurgence of new forms of scam linked to these new technologies.
Our strategy to fight cybercrime is based on three pillars:




Raising awareness in the populations
The reinforcement of policy, treaty and common legislation to fight cybercriminals
The establishment of technologies on a national scale to reinforce cyber-defence

In collaboration with INTERPOL, AFRIPOL has initiated training for national police officers in
protection against DNS (Domain Name Service) attacks. Also, a strategy of public-private
rapprochement has been initiated in order to sign partnerships with Internet leaders and cryptocurrency providers.
The Internet has abolished borders. A cyber-attack launched in Africa may have a direct or indirect
impact on any citizen anywhere in the world. This fight is a long-term one and it is by being united
that we will succeed in effectively defeating cybercrime in Africa and the world.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The African Cyberthreat Assessment Report 2021 was written by INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Directorate
under the aegis of the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC) and funded by the United
Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). INTERPOL’s Support Programme
for the African Union (ISPA) also contributed to this report, with the support of the German Federal
Foreign Office. The report benefited from the data and expertise of INTERPOL’s private partners,
namely Group-IB, Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides INTERPOL’s insights into key cyberthreats that are affecting the African region. It
also presents in-depth analysis on the impact of these threats as well as examples of INTERPOL’s
operational support in combating cybercrime and the regional cybercrime strategy for Africa. Based
on input from the member countries in Africa and data drawn from INTERPOL’s private partners, the
most prominent threats were identified as below.
> Online Scams – For African member countries, the highest-reported and most pressing
cyberthreat across the region was identified as online scamming. This threat seeks to target
and take advantage of victims’ fears, insecurities, and vulnerabilities through phishing, mass
mailing and social engineering. Member countries have reported a sharp increase in the
number of online banking scams, including instances of banking and credit card fraud.
> Digital Extortion – This threat is also identified as one of the most prominent cyberthreats
within the region. Digital extortion seeks to target individuals with either allegations of sexually
compromising images or through direct blackmail campaigns. While such threats are not new
on the threat landscape, the move towards a digital society – particularly within the African
region – has created new attack vectors for criminals to both obfuscate their identity and
target new victims.
> Business Email Compromise – Alongside online scams, Business Email Compromise (BEC) was
identified as a significant concern and threat to the region. Businesses and organizations that
rely heavily on wire transfer transactions are vulnerable to this threat in Africa. The COVID-19
pandemic has contributed to the increase in this type of cybercrime.
> Ransomware – The threat of ransomware is expanding across the African continent. Allegedly,
more than 61% of companies in this region were affected by ransomware in 2020 alone.1 These
attacks targeted some African countries’ critical infrastructure, including healthcare and
maritime sectors.2
> Botnets – Botnets are networks of compromised machines used as a tool to automate largescale campaigns such as DDoS attacks, phishing, malware distribution, etc. The number of
botnet victim detections in Africa was around 50,000, with a monthly average detection of
3,900. In Africa, there have been numerous high-profile instances of such DDoS attacks on
critical infrastructure within the past five years.
Recognizing the need for a change in the approach to cybercrime within Africa as a region that is
embracing digital transformation, the report concludes with INTERPOL’s regional cybercrime strategy
to support member countries in Africa. The strategy encompasses the four strategic objectives below:
>
>
>
>

Enhancing cybercrime intelligence for effective responses to cybercrime;
Strengthening cooperation for joint operations against cybercrime;
Developing regional capacity and capabilities to combat cybercrime;
Promoting good cyber hygiene for a safer cyberspace.

INTERPOL stands ready to support African member countries in fulfilling these objectives and further
developing a joint operational framework to improve coordinated actions against cybercrime in Africa.
Collective efforts in sharing intelligence and formulating a joint operational framework will boost
regional capabilities and capacity in the fight against cybercrime.

INTRODUCTION

Africa has more than 500 million Internet users, placing the region ahead of other regions such as
North America, South America, and the Middle East.3 This volume of users relative to population
equates to about 38%, which implies the number is expected to grow in the coming years, given the
accelerated digitalization. The leading countries are Kenya with 83% of its population being online,
Nigeria with 60% and South Africa with 56%.3 Mobile banking in particular is noted to be used widely
within these three countries, contributing to Africa’s active role in digital financial services.4 It poses a
significant future threat, with
the rise in malicious apps on
mobile devices exploiting
increasing vulnerabilities.
Despite the high demand for
online mobile banking, the
digital divide remains a
challenge, especially as the
member countries in Africa move forward to incorporate digital infrastructure into the foundations of
their society, including government, banking, business and critical infrastructure. This transformation
highlights the urgent need to ensure cybersecurity parameters and standards meet the demands and
future needs of this community, including financial inclusion.5
However, the absence of these standards is pervasive in Africa. 90% of African businesses are operating
without the necessary cybersecurity protocols in place.6 Without these protocols, threat actors are
able to exploit increasing vulnerabilities as they continue to invent new cyberattack vectors. This leads
to significant financial loss. In 2016, cybercrime has cost the Kenyan economy about 36 million USD,
the South African economy 573 million USD and the Nigerian economy 500 million USD.7 A research
study from Deloitte indicated the financial loss for financial institutions in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda,
Tanzania, and Zambia since 2011 to be more than 245 million USD.

the necessary cyber security protocols in place.”

In the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the cybercrime ecosystem,8 with a persisting
digital divide and increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the region. Similarly to other regions,

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

the African region experienced attacks against critical infrastructure and frontline services during the
pandemic. This was most prominently seen in South Africa and Botswana. For instance, South Africa’s
Life Healthcare Group, responsible for managing 66 health facilities, was hit by a serious and sustained
cyberattack.9
Indeed, the growing rate of digital
transformation within the African region
is facilitating the emergence of new
attack vectors and opportunities for
cybercriminals. In recognition of the
magnitude of the problem caused by
cyberthreats in Africa, the next section
provides in-depth analysis on the
cybercrime threat landscape in Africa.
Research from a Kenyan IT cybersecurity
company, Serianu, highlighted that
cybercrime reduced GDP within Africa by
more than 10%, at a cost of an estimated
4.12 billion USD in 2021.10 INTERPOL’s
partner, Trend Micro, recorded millions
of threat detections in Africa from
January 2020 to February 2021:
> Email: 679 million detections
> Files: 8.2 million detections
> Web: 14.3 million detections

Figure 1. Overall detection of cyber threats in Africa
using Trend Micro sensors (Source: Trend Micro)

More specifically, South Africa had 230 million threat detections in total, while Kenya had 72 million
and Morocco 71 million. In South Africa, 219 million detections were related to email threats.
South Africa also had the highest targeted ransomware and BEC attempts.
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities within South Africa was further highlighted by Accenture, who
identified that South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide, at a cost of
R2.2 billion a year.11 The scale of this cyber criminality is further evidenced when we consider that the
country has seen a 100% increase in mobile banking application fraud and is estimated to suffer
577 malware attacks an hour.12 Such malware attacks are one of the emerging threats.
With the diversified and evolving attack vectors and the targeted approach against frontline response
organizations, global supply chains and critical infrastructure, there has never been a more crucial time
to both chart a way forward and ensure that efforts are focused on improving security and safety in
cyberspace for all African member countries.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

1.1

Methodology

To conduct this assessment, INTERPOL has sought input from its member countries in Africa and a total
of 22 member countries out of 55 have responded to the survey providing their national views on
cyberthreats. INTERPOL has also received relevant data from its private partners including Group-IB,
Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro. The collected information has been combined with
internal detections and analysis by INTERPOL Cybercrime Directorate, and an open-source review of
information, data and assessments relevant to this region. This multi-stakeholder approach has
formulated a comprehensive assessment of the cyberthreat landscape within the region.

The creation of the AFJOC project in March 2021 was a catalyst for developing this report in terms of
outreach and coordination with INTERPOL’s African member countries. Based on the assessment
result, the AFJOC project will develop an operational framework within the region to provide a
framework for consideration by member countries when developing governance policies, roles and
responsibilities, procedures, communications and capacity development. In delivering this,
collaboration with the key regional organizations is crucial, such as The African Union and Afripol. The
ISPA project underpins these relationships, collaborations and potential synergies.

KEY CYBERTHREATS IN AFRICA

2.1

Online Scams

What are

online
scams?

Online scams encompass various types of fraud in cyberspace.
They range from, inter alia, phishing, credit card theft,
identity theft, advance payment fraud, card-not-present
(CNP) fraud and cryptocurrency scams. They typically seek to
exploit victims’ fears, insecurities or vulnerabilities while using
numerous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) online.
Complex organized crime groups often run bespoke sophisticated
malware tools to make illicit financial gains from unsuspecting victims.

The most common type of online scam is phishing. It can be facilitated by emails, SMS, phone calls or
a phishing kit.13 For banking and credit card fraud, threat
actors
exploit
the
vulnerabilities of unpatched banking systems or
individuals,
using
social engineering tactics to obtain credit card
information or
access to online banking information. According
to
Kaspersky, phishing emails may leverage
scenarios such as delivery, postal, financial and
HR services, convincing victims to open
malicious attachments or click on malicious
links.14
Online scammers also set up malicious
domains to facilitate fraudulent
activities. They may make use of mass
phishing tools or kits. Online
scamming is a cost-effective strategy
adopted by threat actors, as there
are
minimal
technical
requirements and low start-up
costs.

14

A phishing kit is a tool purchased by one threat actor from another to allow for mass facilitation of phishing
campaigns.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

Situation in Africa
According to African member countries, the most prevalent and pressing cyberthreat is online scams.
In particular, banking and credit card fraud is recognized as a serious threat in Africa. It involves the
theft of personal data and banking details which are then used by a threat actor to either purchase
goods, siphon funds or sell on markets. Coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the
cybercrime landscape, Africa saw a sustained increase in the volume of cyberattacks,15 including the
238% rise in cyberattacks on online banking platforms in 2020.16
At the same time, threat actors in Africa are deploying Trojan information stealers such as Agent Tesla,
Lokibot, Fareit and others to commit online scams. Many cybercriminals offer toolkits as a service and
training available online has contributed to the continuous operations and development of
cybercriminals.
Considering
the
broader
online
scam
situation
across the African
region,
data
received
from
Trend
Micro
indicates that 27%
of its web threat
detection in Africa
related to online
scams in May 2021,
as shown in Figure
2 below.

Adware, 4%

Figure 2. Top Web Threat Detection in Africa in May 2021 only (Source: Trend Micro)

The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) evidenced that “gross fraud losses on
South African issued cards increased by 20.5% from 2018 to 2019” with CNP fraud and banking
malware attacks, behind only Russia.17 Yet this number fails to take into account the influx of COVID-19
related phishing attempts and the financial, emotional and mental impact they have on victims. Stolen
data from carding scams is auctioned off to the highest bidder or sold within underground forums –
meaning unsuspecting victims of credit card fraud in the African region may have their credit card
information misused globally following the breach.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

According to the KnowBe4 African Report 201918 with over 800 respondents across South Africa,
Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius and Botswana, phishing was one of the top cyber
threats faced by the African region. 28.14% of respondents reported that they had previously clicked
on a phishing email, 27.71% had previously fallen for a scam, and 19% had forwarded a spam or hoax
email. INTERPOL’s private partner Kaspersky detected that South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Rwanda
and Ethiopia had about 2 million phishing attempts in 2020 alone.19
Another growing concern for African member countries is cryptocurrency scams, in which threat actors
seek to defraud victims of their cryptocurrency. An ISS report has highlighted two examples of
cryptocurrency investment scams in South Africa.20 These examples involved, firstly, a Ponzi scheme
where thousands of investors were allegedly scammed out of 588 million USD in Bitcoin by the
company Mirror Trading International in 2020. The second case was where the two founders of the
trading company Africrypt allegedly absconded with 3.6 billion USD from investors in April 2021.
South Africa was therefore one of the top ten countries globally where threat actors received the
highest volume of cryptocurrency from illicit addresses. In addition to investment scams, a growing
threat in the cryptocurrency space is that of wallet phishing, where threat actors utilize false or
misleading advertisements, imposter domains, fake wallet or decentralized finance platforms to obtain
a victim’s cryptocurrency wallet private keys, thus enabling them to steal funds from the victim’s
accounts.

2.2

Digital Extortion

One of the most prevalent cyberthreats in Africa was reported to be
What is

digital
extortion?

digital extortion involving blackmailing and sextortion. It involves
threat actors coercing individuals with either false claims or
proof of stolen personal data or files, for which the victim is
then asked to pay in exchange for recovering the data or not
leaking it online. More specifically, sextortion threat actors utilize
phishing and blackmail across multiple platforms to get money from
their victims, with claims that they have obtained compromising sexual
images or the sexual browsing history of their victim.

INTERPOL’s analysis identified the most common modus operandi for digital extortion as being where
threat actors rent Virtual Private Servers (VPS) with a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service to
launch bulk extortion emails. Within these digital extortion emails, threat actors often claim to have
compromised the security of the victims’ computers, files or history.
Cyber blackmail can also be combined with social engineering techniques that seek to research their
victims and take advantage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that victims leave online in social
media posts, or from previous data breaches that have been released on either open or dark Web
forums, as threat actors use increasingly sophisticated techniques to create personalized extortion
messages for each victim.
Similarly, the modus operandi for sextortion can also involve false claims about access to individuals’
webcams or browsing history, and then be followed up with demands for payment in crypto to prevent
this information being leaked to close friends or publicly. While such claims are often mass-produced,
sextortion activities have also
been detected in apps, where
threat
actors
will
trick
unsuspecting victims, who are
usually male, to pre-record or send
videos of themselves performing
sex acts to what they believe are
females, with the threat actors
then threatening to release the
footage unless the victim pays a
financial sum.21

Situation in Africa
Pivoting from the understanding of digital blackmail via extortion, data provided from INTERPOL’s
private partner Trend Micro identified some IP addresses in Africa that were used to send out digital
extortion spam messages. From January 2021 to May 2021, the count of unique IP addresses is about
10.6% of the overall number. The top sender countries include South Africa, Morocco, Kenya and
Tunisia. The IP addresses can be from botnet networks or dedicated VPSs rented by the cybercriminals.

Business Email Compromise

What is

Business
Email
Compromise?

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of scam targeting companies
and organizations for financial gain or data theft. Cybercriminals
typically compromise or spoof a legitimate email account to send
fraudulent emails requesting transfer of funds or sensitive
data while posing as the legitimate owner of the email
account.

Cybercriminals usually target high-level executives working in finance
or involved with wire transfer payments. They compromise the
corporate email accounts of such employees via methods such as
keylogging or phishing attacks, or simply spoof their emails to appear as though
it is sent from the target’s legitimate email account. Fraudulent emails are then sent from these email
accounts with an established level of trust to other employees or related individuals, asking them to
transfer funds or data to a specific bank account. The three types of BEC scam are illustrated in the
diagrams below, developed by Trend Micro.
Bogus Invoice Scheme
The Bogus Invoice Scheme usually involves a business that has an established
relationship with a supplier. The fraudster asks for invoice payment monies to be wired
to an alternative, fraudulent account via a spoofed email, telephone, or fax message.

CEO Fraud
In CEO Fraud, the fraudsters identify themselves as high-level executives (CFO, CEO,
CTO, etc.), lawyers, or other types of legal representative, and purport to be handling
confidential or time-sensitive matters and initiate a wire transfer to an account they
control. In some cases, the fraudulent request for wire transfer is sent directly to the
financial institution with instructions to urgently send funds to a bank. This scam is also
known as “CEO Fraud”, “Business Executive Scam”, “Masquerading”, and “Financial
Industry Wire Fraud”.

16

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

Account Compromise
In Account Compromise cases, an employee’s email account is hacked and then used
to make requests for invoice payments to fraudster-controlled bank accounts.
Messages are sent to multiple vendors identified from the employee’s contact list. The
business may not become aware of the scheme until their vendors follow up to check
the status of the invoice payment.

To assist individuals and organizations further in avoiding BEC, the FBI has also published a list of red
flags and tips for recognizing and preventing such BEC attempts (see Table 1).

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

Situation in Africa
According to Trend Micro, the proportion of BEC attempts on victims in Africa from 2020 to April 2021
was less than 1% of global BEC attempts. The top BEC attempts are in English-speaking countries such
as the United States, Australia and the UK. As BEC cybercriminals usually target larger corporations
which will potentially lead to bigger pay-outs, the likely reason for the lower proportion of BEC
attempts in Africa is the relatively smaller concentration of large businesses and corporations there.
However, there are several offshore companies based in Africa, and the COVID-19 pandemic situation
contributed to the increase in this type of cybercrime. Their employees rely heavily on wire transfer
transactions, opening up more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit. Within Africa, it was mainly
detected in countries like South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritius, Nigeria and Kenya (see Figure 4).

This figure is likely to rise, given the strong potential and positive economic projections for the African
region. In addition, 2020 statistics showed that African countries dominated the ranking of countries
with the highest GDP growth worldwide.22 Although COVID-19 slowed GDP growth significantly, the
economic fundamentals are still in place and demonstrate the possibility that BEC actors might
increasingly target the region in the hope of higher pay-outs in the future.
Meanwhile, a 2020 report from Agari’s Cyber Intelligence Division (ACID) stressed that a majority (60%)
of BEC actors globally were located in Africa, across 11 countries in the region. The report also found
that “83% percent of African attackers, as well as 50% of global BEC actors, hailed from Nigeria”.23

In response to the detected high concentration of BEC actors within the Nigerian region, INTERPOL,
alongside its private partner Group-IB and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF), launched the successful
“Operation Falcon”, which severely disrupted a prolific BEC group and led to three arrests. This
proactive law enforcement action was also followed up with the arrest of another prominent group of
Nigerian BEC actors in March 2021 after an investigation by the Nigerian Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission.24
In September 2019, a month-long operation entitled “rewired”, led by the FBI, disrupted and
dismantled BEC schemes. It resulted in 281 arrests in Nigeria, Turkey, Ghana, France, Italy, Japan,
Kenya, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States. It also successfully seized nearly
3.7 million
USD
and
recovered about 118 million
USD in fraudulent wire
transfers.25 This operation
was another example that

Botnets

What is a

botnet?

A Botnet is a network of hijacked computers and devices infected with
bot malware and remotely controlled by a hacker (see Figure 9). The
bot network can be used to send spam, launch Distributed
Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and may be rented out to
other cybercriminals. Botnets can also be an entry point for
ransomware attacks. Any machine that can connect to the Internet
can be compromised and turned into a device in a botnet, such as
computers, mobile devices, internet infrastructure hardware such as
network routers, and increasingly, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices such as

smart home devices.
According to Kaspersky, there are three stages to building a botnet:26
PREP & EXPOSE

The victim device is
infected with malware
that can take control of it

The hacker exploits a
vulnerability to expose the
victim device to malware

INFECT

ACTIVATE

Hackers mobilize all
infected devices to
carry out attacks

Upon activation, hackers send commands and control the botnet from a main server, known as the
Command & Control (C&C) server. Older C&C models use a centralized C&C server where all commands
are sent from. However, since this reduces the anonymity of the hackers, as their C&C servers can be
traced, newer C&C models now use a decentralized peer-to-peer model where the hackers can send
and spread commands to the entire botnet via any of the bots, thus concealing their identity.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

Figure 9. An overview of a botnet attack (Source: Kaspersky)

Situation in Africa
According to Trend Micro, the victims of botnets in Africa average 3,900 detections monthly, with
roughly 50,000 detections in total. Several threat actors in Africa are deploying spam run campaigns
with enclosed Trojan stealers such as Emotet, Lokibot, Agent Tesla, Fareit, etc. Surprisingly, Namibia
had the highest detections of Emotet, although it subsided after global efforts to disrupt the Emotet
botnet early this year. Other top malware detections are backdoor web shells and Dorkbot that is able
to spread via removable drives, e-mail and social media.
Cybercriminals are recruiting new members by training and introducing several cybercrime toolkits.
This has been one of the reasons for the expansion of DDoS operations of this type with cybercrime as
a service available through the open and dark Web environments. The expansion of online
communication platforms has provided a learning environment for cybercriminals to develop and
enhance their skills, learn and exchange information on cybercrime toolkits, and even share their
lessons learnt, stolen data and successful exploits with other individuals.
There have been many high-profile instances of such DDoS attacks on critical infrastructure in Africa
in the past five years. For example, the 2016 Mirai botnet DDoS attack on Liberia crippled the internet
infrastructure of the entire country, with attacks of over 500 gigabytes-per-second (Gbps), then among
the largest DDoS attacks ever.27 More recently, in September 2019, a large South African Internet
Service Provider (ISP) was also the victim of a DDoS attack which brought it down for an entire day.28
Similarly, in October 2019 and 2020, South African banks also experienced a sustained wave of DDoS
attacks, though no significant damage was reported. Although there have been no significant recent
cyber incidents arising from DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks remain a concerning threat that organizations
in Africa will need to guard against.

Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of malware which encrypts victim data or locks
down systems, disrupting the operations of victim organizations by
rendering their data and systems inaccessible. Ransomware
What is
actors subsequently demand a ransom, usually in
cryptocurrency for anonymity, in exchange for decrypting
the data. It should be noted that the deployment of
ransomware code onto an organization’s network follows a
legitimate (trusted insider) or illegitimate breach of that network,
exploration of the network by cybercriminals, and the theft of
organizational information and data. The deployment of ransomware is
generally the final phase of a successful hack or penetration on that organization.

Ransomware?

With TTPs becoming ever more sophisticated, the facilitation of ransomware attacks by organized
crime groups has expanded to include double and triple extortions – where the initial ransomware
attack is compounded by the theft of sensitive company data, ransom demands from victims with the
threat of publicly shaming them through the release of stolen information and the re-exploitation of
previously-exposed vulnerabilities within organizations to leave them facing a never-ending cycle of
ransomware attacks.
Capable of bringing governments, business and supply chains to a grinding halt, the impact of
ransomware attacks also has a reputational impact on victims alongside the economic impact, with
the latter evidenced in research from INTERPOL’s private partner, Palo Alto Networks, showing that
the average ransomware payment has accelerated to more than 300,000 USD.29
This impact is further compounded when we consider the growing adoption of the TTP by organized
crime groups which results in key files and backups being deleted, adding to the estimated average
downtime of 21 days for each ransomware attack30. With research suggesting a ransomware attack
occurs
every
11
seconds, and given the
previously-highlighted
cyber
vulnerabilities
within
the
African
region, the need for
both
a
thorough
understanding of the
ransomware situation
within
Africa
and
implementation of the
prevent and protect
principles has never
been more urgent.

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

Situation in Africa
Research from Kaspersky shows that there were more than 1.5 million ransomware detections in 2020.
In the first quarter of 2021, Egypt, South Africa, and Tunisia suffered the most with the highest
detection counts across Africa, and Egypt alone accounting for almost 35% of all ransomware
detections in Africa (see Table 2).

Although the ratio of overall ransomware detections within Africa ranked in the bottom 10% compared
to all other regions, research from Check Point Software Technologies reported that African
organizations have seen the “highest increase in attacks, at 34%”, from January to April 2021.31
According to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in January 2021, “as Internet penetration rises and
systems become more connected, critical infrastructure across Africa will likely become even more
vulnerable to costly, disruptive cyberattacks”.32
In Africa, Wannacry remains a top ransomware program and cybercriminals are also expanding their
operations into double extortion. One example is the notorious ransomware Nefilim, where it affects
banking and government sectors.

According to Figure 6 above, South Africa was the country most heavily affected by targeted
ransomware in the first quarter of 2021, with a variety of families such as Crysis, Nefilim, Ryuk, Clop,
and Conti ransomware. Subsequently, Egypt was the next hardest-hit country with a similar profile of
targeted ransomware detection. Tunisia was the third most affected country, targeted mainly with
Egregor (before its shutdown in February 2021), Ryuk, and Sekhmet ransomware.

24

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

The industries most affected in Africa are the government and food-and-beverage sectors, according
to Trend Micro (see Figure 7). It has been observed that the reason the Wannacry ransomware is so
prevalent in the government sector is that many machines have not been patched for the vulnerability
in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is a known target of Wannacry ransomware.
Meanwhile, there is also a variety of old ransomware families like Cerber, Gandcrab, Locky, Cryptesla
that target the government, food-and-beverage, and manufacturing sectors. However, one notable
exception is the newer and notorious Nefilim ransomware, discovered in March 2020,33 which is
targeting the banking industry in the Africa Region.
Since ransomware actors are profit-driven, the problem will persist globally as long as victim
organizations are willing or forced to pay ransoms. According to the Brookings Institution in March
2021, cyber threats in Africa are exacerbated by vulnerabilities in public cybersecurity strategies and
the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.34

“Cybercriminals are developing and boosting their
attacks at an alarming pace, exploiting the fear
and uncertainty caused by the unstable social and
economic situation created by COVID-19.”

EXAMPLES OF ATTACKS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN AFRICA








In South Africa, the organization Life Healthcare, which is the second-largest private hospital
operator responsible for administering digital services in hospitals across Southern Africa, was
hit by a cyberattack in June 2020.32 This attack, instigated during the COVID-19 pandemic,
affected its admission systems, business processing systems and email servers, with some
systems being forced offline. It is believed to have cost the organization more than a month
in downtime in the midst of the pandemic.
There were the twin attacks in October 2020, where firstly key social services in Johannesburg,
including bill payments, social advice and the emergency services network were impacted and
shut down following a data breach and then deployment of ransomware. Analysis of the
attack identified not only the exploitation of a vulnerability, but also that after employing
lateral movement techniques the threat actors deliberately deployed their ransomware to
coincide with the “end of the month” payment cycle – in an effort to further coerce South
African authorities to pay the cryptocurrency ransom.33
In Kenya, an attack targeted the markets and interconnected cyber systems, with INTERPOL
warning that the threat of supply chain attacks may well define the cyber threat landscape
over the coming decade. High-profile attacks on supply chains, with the compromise of the
Kaseya IT service by the ransomware group REVIL34 are particularly affecting customers in
Kenya.
There was a DDoS attack on South African banks – again timed to hit and disable services at
the “end of the month” payment cycle. This was launched against several major banks across
South Africa – with a ransom again demanded in cryptocurrency. While the reported damage
from this attack was minimal and caused only disruption to services, the conjunction of this
attack with the simultaneous ransomware attack in Johannesburg emphasizes the scale,
impact and seriousness of the threat to critical infrastructure across the African region.
The State-owned Transnet organization in South Africa faced an unprecedented cyberattack
in July 2021, which resulted in severe disruption to its services.35 The Institute for Security
Studies (ISS) highlighted that “first time the integrity of South Africa’s critical maritime
infrastructure has been severely disrupted” with an attack on the port able to delay or shut
down a critical trade route and disrupt vital trade services in the middle of a global pandemic.
The attack is believed to have suspended the automated and online container-handling facility
in both Cape Town and Durban – with the Durban port being the busiest port in sub-Saharan
Africa and a maritime hub for the movement of essential goods between other African
countries, including Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

OPERATIONAL SUCCESS

Under its mandate of reducing the global impact of cybercrime and protecting communities for a safer
world, the INTERPOL Cybercrime Directorate delivers policing capabilities to all member countries
through the Global Cybercrime Programme. The Global Cybercrime Programme has three core pillars,
namely: (i) Cybercrime Threat Response, (ii) Cyber Strategy and Capabilities Development, and
(iii) Cybercrime Operations.
The Cybercrime Threat Response pillar identifies, triages and coordinates a global response to
cyberthreats in a targeted and focused manner, leveraging private partners’ expertise and cybercrime
data. It focuses on intelligence development of identified threats to design disruption-and-prevention
strategies that mitigate high-risk and high-impact cyberthreats. It also aims to provide quality advice
and guidance on the current threat landscape, as well as operational support through the provision of
actionable intelligence.
The Cyber Strategy and Capabilities Development pillar supports member countries by developing
cyber skills, knowledge and technical capabilities that are customized to their needs, in line with
INTERPOL standards. In collaboration with its stakeholders, the team plans, develops and delivers
cyber capability and capacity-building projects and programmes, as well as tools and platforms, to
enhance member countries’ ability to tackle cybercrime globally.
The Cybercrime Operations pillar leads and coordinates transnational operational activities with
member countries in tackling cyberthreats that cause significant harm on a national, regional and
global scale. In close cooperation with member countries, the public-private sector and national
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) communities, it conducts operational activities targeting
high-impact cybercrime through the ‘Regional Cybercrime Operations Desk’ approach.
In May 2021, INTERPOL launched a new Regional Cybercrime Operations Desk to boost the capacity of
49 African countries to fight cybercrime under the framework of the AFJOC project. This African
Cybercrime Operations Desk will help shape a regional strategy to drive intelligence-led coordinated
actions against cybercriminals and support joint operations. The two operations highlighted below
have provided timely and effective operational support to member countries in Africa.

Operation Lyrebird

In July 2021, an alleged prolific cybercriminal was apprehended in Morocco following a joint two-year
investigation by INTERPOL, the Moroccan police and Group-IB. Acting under the pseudonym ‘Dr Hex’,
the suspect is believed to have targeted thousands of unsuspecting victims over several years through
global phishing, fraud and carding activities involving credit card fraud.
He is also accused of defacing numerous websites by modifying their appearance and content, and
targeting French-speaking communications companies, multiple banks and multinational companies
with malware campaigns. The suspect is also alleged to have helped develop carding and phishing kits,
which were then sold to other individuals through online forums to allow them to facilitate similar
malicious campaigns against victims.
These were then used to impersonate online banking facilities, allowing the suspect and others to steal
sensitive information and defraud trusting individuals for financial gain, with the losses of individuals
and companies published online in order to advertise these malicious services.
Under Operation Lyrebird, INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Directorate worked closely with Group-IB and with
the Moroccan Police via the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in Rabat to eventually locate and
apprehend the individual, who remains under investigation.

Operation Falcon

Under ‘Operation Falcon’, three suspects were arrested in Lagos in November 2020 following a joint
INTERPOL, Group-IB and Nigerian Police Force cybercrime investigation. The Nigerian nationals are
believed to be members of a wider organized crime group responsible for distributing malware,
carrying out phishing campaigns and extensive BEC scams.
The suspects are alleged to have developed phishing links, domains, and mass-mailing campaigns in
which they impersonated representatives of organizations. They then used these campaigns to
disseminate 26 malware programs, spyware and remote access tools, including Agent Tesla, Loki,
Azorult, Spartan and the Nanocore and Remcos Remote Access Trojans. These programs were used to
infiltrate and monitor the systems of victim organizations and individuals, before launching scams and
syphoning funds.
According to Group-IB, the prolific gang is believed to have compromised government and private
sector companies in more than 150 countries since 2017. The year-long investigation saw INTERPOL’s
Cybercrime Directorate and Financial Crime units work closely with Group-IB to identify and locate
threats and, ultimately, assist the Nigerian Police Force via the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in
Abuja, in taking swift action.

INTERPOL’S REGIONAL CYBERCRIME STRATEGY FOR AFRICA

INTERPOL provides a regional cybercrime strategy for Africa which underpins the operational
framework of the African Cybercrime Operations Desk. In support of the activities of this Desk, the
strategy encompasses four strategic objectives, outlined below.

Strategic Objective 1:
Enhancing cybercrime intelligence
for effective responses to
cybercrime

Strategic Objective 3:
Developing regional capabilities
and capacity to combat
cybercrime effectively

Strategic Objective 2:
Strengthening cooperation for joint
operations against cybercrime

Strategic Objective 4:
Promoting good cyber hygiene and
resilience for a safer cyberspace

30

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

The African Cybercrime Operations Desk under the AFJOC project will address cybercrime in support
of the African region through the following strategic pillars:
> [Objective 1] Enhancing cybercrime intelligence for effective responses to cybercrime
Within the partnership framework of Gateway, INTERPOL will collaborate with private entities
to request and receive up-to-date information related to cybercrime threats, trends and risks
in the African region. By processing and analysing information using external tools and those
developed in-house, INTERPOL will deepen its understanding of the cybercrime threat
landscape, generating timely and accurate cyber intelligence and threat responses for African
member countries.
> [Objective 2] Strengthening cooperation for joint operations against cybercrime
In close cooperation with member countries, private partners and national Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT) communities, INTERPOL will strengthen cooperation and
increase joint operations targeting high-impact cybercrime through the African Cybercrime
Operations Desk.
> [Objective 3] Developing regional capacity and capabilities to combat cybercrime
In collaboration with its stakeholders, INTERPOL will plan, develop and deliver cyber capability and
capacity-building projects and programmes to enhance member countries’ ability to tackle
cybercrime in Africa. As part of this effort, it will maximize the use of tools and platforms
including the Cybercrime Knowledge Exchange, Cybercrime Collaborative Platform –
Operations, and Cyber Fusion Platform.
> [Objective 4] Promoting good cyber hygiene for a safer cyberspace
INTERPOL will run a global awareness campaign with the aim of raising public awareness of the
key cyberthreats and promoting good cyber hygiene for individuals and businesses in Africa.
This campaign will also support regional law enforcement mitigation and prevention efforts
targeting the top cyberthreats, for better operational outcomes.
The African Cybercrime Operations Desk acts as a conduit between law enforcement communities in
Africa and the private sector to achieve these objectives and further develop the operational
framework to improve coordinated actions against cybercrime in Africa.

31

AFRICAN CYBERTHREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT

CONCLUSION
This African Cyberthreat Assessment Report 2021 has detailed the context and analysis of the
cybercrime threat landscape in Africa, focusing on the top five threats. These threats are affecting
other regions equally, confirming the borderless nature of cybercrime. The unique challenge for Africa
appears to be the critical absence of cybersecurity protocol, cyber resilience as well as mitigation and
prevention measures for individuals and businesses. As a region that is embracing digital
transformation, Africa needs to invest extensively in improving the safety and security of cyberspace.
The report also underlined how INTERPOL is supporting its member countries in addressing
cyberthreats by coordinating cybercrime operations that have led to successful identification and
apprehension of threat actors in collaboration with its private partners. The result of this assessment
may encourage member countries to prioritize and allocate resources to address cybercrime, in order
to increase such operational activities and achieve better outcomes.
Given the fast-evolving and transnational nature of cybercrime, it is evident that cybercrime can only
be tackled effectively through a coordinated and rapid response. Intelligence gathering and sharing is
a vital component in achieving an effective law enforcement response. INTERPOL is equipped with the
intelligence capability hosted within its Cybercrime Threat Response team and through the
establishment of the African Cybercrime Operations Desk.
In this context, member countries should leverage and maximize the use of police-level cooperation
through INTERPOL’s channels, platforms and capabilities for a timely and effective response. Collective
efforts in sharing intelligence and formulating a joint operational framework will boost the regional
capabilities and capacity in the fight against cybercrime. With this in mind, this report also suggested
a regional cybercrime strategy for Africa which will serve as a basis for the joint operational framework
to be developed for Africa.
Looking ahead, law enforcement must be a trusted partner, as data sharing is key – including between
national police forces, and with the public and private sectors. At a time when the international
community is under exceptional pressure, bolstering our common security requires us to move
towards more collaboration. Together with our member countries and partners, INTERPOL will
continue to reduce the impact of cybercrime and protect communities for a safer world.
