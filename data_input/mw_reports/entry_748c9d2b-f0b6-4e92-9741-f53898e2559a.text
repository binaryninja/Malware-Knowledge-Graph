The DarkSide ransomware gang has collected at least $90 million in ransoms paid by its
victims over the past nine months to multiple Bitcoin wallets.
Around 10% of the profit came in one week from attacking just two companies: Colonial
Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline system in the United States, and Brenntag, a large chemical
distribution company in Germany.

Huge ransom payments
Blockchain analysis company Elliptic found and analyzed ransom payments made to
DarkSide from 47 distinct Bitcoin wallets. The transactions totaled just over $90 million since
October 2020.

Assuming these are all the payments that DarkSide received from its victims, the group’s
average ransom would be $1.9 million, making the threat actor one of the greediest in the
ransomware business.
A blog post from Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service provider eSentire on May
12, a day before DarkSide operations closed, counted 59 victims listed on the gang’s leak
site, which would add to the 47 associated with the Bitcoin wallets that Elliptic analyzed.
Although DarkSide launched in August 2020, the gang became a prolific actor on the
ransomware scene and saw a significant surge in profits lately.
Elliptic notes in a report last week that the operation made $17.5 million, which is around
20% of its known total profits, only in the past three months.
Attacks on Colonial Pipeline and Brenntag chemical distribution company brought the
cybercriminals about $10 million, as the former paid nearly $5 million and the latter paid a
$4.4 million ransom.

Splitting the profit
Being a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, the DarkSide profits were split between
the developers of the malware and the affiliates that breached victim networks, stole data,
and deployed the file-encrypting malware.

Affiliates, or partners, typically get the lion’s share of the money because they do most of the
work. In the case of DarkSide, they got between 75% and 90% of the profit, depending on
the size of the ransom.
For ransoms smaller than $500,000, the DarkSide developers would take 25%; the share
decreased to 10% for larger payments of more than $5 million.
Elliptic co-founder and chief scientist Dr. Tom Robinson says that the “split of the ransom
payment is very clear to see on the blockchain” and that the malware developer received
$15.5 million worth of bitcoins from the total profits.

Following the transactions from wallets belonging to DarkSide affiliates, Robinson found that
18% of the proceeds were sent to some exchange services and 4% went to a large dark
market that provides, among others, cash-out services.
With $90 million from ransoms over a period of nine months, DarkSide sits among the most
profitable ransomware groups:
Ryuk - at least $150 million
GandCrab - $150 million (self-claim) in one year and a half
REvil - $100 million (self-claim) in one year
Maze/Egregor - over $63 million received to one Bitcoin address in four months
(between August 2020 and the end of the year)
Netwalker - $25 million in five months
Qlocker - $260,000 in 5 days
