Identifying Critical Infrastructure Targeting through
Network Creation
domaintools.com/resources/blog/identifying-critical-infrastructure-targeting-through-network-creation

Background
In addition to independent investigations, DomainTools closely tracks the work of other
respected researchers to see what we might miss in our own efforts. Recently, we learned
of possible new infrastructure related to the threat actor known as OilRig (aka, APT34 or
Helix Kitten). In these situations, DomainTools works to understand the background for such
infrastructure and any tendencies which may be revealed by their creation in order to learn
how given adversaries operate.
Aside from learning about adversaries, such efforts may also yield new, independent results
through further research and analysis. In this case, a preliminary search of DomainTools
data yielded a number of interesting, related results to the initial domain:

Several items stood out in the above list of related infrastructure, notably related to common
email addresses linked to registrations:
cjay006[AT]yandex[.]com
ch1styjoe[AT]yandex[.]com
diandianlai[AT]yandex[.]com
lovelead247[AT]yandex[.]com
Using DomainTools Iris, each of these observed email addresses become a launchpad for
investigating additional, related infrastructure. Although at this point connections appear too
weak to definitively tie activity back to OilRig behaviors, which is where this investigation
began, we have nonetheless reached an interesting and potentially useful intermediate
conclusion by identifying linked, suspicious network infrastructure.

Identifying Network Infrastructure
Most notable among the common items above are those linked to the “cjay006” address:

Several themes emerge in the above list, looking at the actual names used for domain
creation:
Mimicking corporate or executive themes (e.g., “boardsexecutives,” “mngtboard”).

4/7

Themes linked to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (e.g., “chinaconstructioncorp,”
“petrochinas,” “anhuisiafu”).
Construction or engineering company spoofing (in addition to “chinaconstructioncorp,”
“lavalingroup” is similar to Canadian engineering company SNC-Lavalin).
Hosting patterns aside, reviewing registration and DNS data showed that some domains
featured interesting Mail Exchange (MX) records referring back to the original domain. As
described in previous DomainTools blogs, identifying certain hosting and functional
characteristics to infrastructure can yield insights into adversary activity. In this case, the
presence of the MX records, especially for items such as the construction-themed domains,
may indicate use for phishing purposes.

Unearthing a Phishing Campaign
Researching several malware repositories, DomainTools researchers uncovered multiple
emails sent from the infrastructure described in the previous section. Reviewed messages
are similar to the following item:

Email messages had the following purpose and themes:
Addressed to either the Russian state nuclear energy firm ROSATOM or its nuclear
fuel production subsidiary TVEL.
Written in Chinese with a “password reset” theme.
Sent from the SNC-Lavalin spoofing domain.
Furthermore, all samples identified by DomainTools contained a link to a common resource:
hXXp://iafflocal290[.]org/sapm/Poland/china[.]php

The page presents a logon screen:

5/7

The page appears to be a straightforward credential harvester, submitting credentials
entered into the form fields as a POST to the same hosting domain. The domain itself
appears to be either an abandoned or compromised legitimate website associated with a
local fire department in the United States.
Further research identified the above as a common spoofed logon page for likely credential
harvesting purposes. Among other entities identified, DomainTools researchers uncovered
pages targeting:
A major automobile manufacturer.
A major automotive parts supplier.
An Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology company.

Purpose and Context
The activity above is interesting on several levels. While Canadian-based SNC-Lavalin has
operations worldwide, including in the nuclear industry, the company has no known links to
Rosatom, TVEL, or Chinese nuclear projects. However, Rosatom and TVEL have
significant operations involving Chinese reactor construction and development. Based on
these links, DomainTools assesses some possibility for phishing themes combining Russian
nuclear organizations with Chinese construction and critical infrastructure entities against
individuals working on such projects.

6/7

Yet the samples in question all leverage the Lavalin theme, which does not align with any
known projects or activity. The combination of Canadian engineering company spoofing,
Russian nuclear technology targeting, and Chinese language phishing messages is
therefore somewhat confusing.
Further research identified the credential harvesting pages associated with other entities,
largely with technology or manufacturing themes. Based on this information, a likely
intention for the Lavalin-ROSATOM campaign would appear to be credential harvesting to
further follow-on espionage and data theft. Unfortunately, insufficient evidence exists to
definitively support this claim.
While this investigation began by pivoting off of infrastructure linked to OilRig— associated
with Iranian interests by multiple entities—there is nothing conclusive linking the identified
phishing activity to behaviors associated with Iranian threat groups. This is especially the
case after uncovering the additional, similarly-structured logon pages targeting other
industries. At this time DomainTools cannot align the observed phishing activity with any
known, tracked threat actor.

Conclusion
Threat hunters and researchers need to incorporate third-party findings and investigations
into their own work to expand horizons and ingest new observations for subsequent
enrichment. By expanding upon identified work and threat indicators, researchers can
unearth related or potentially even completely separate campaigns that happen to overlap
in certain characteristics.
Such is the case with the above investigation, where initial analysis of likely OilRig-related
observables revealed a phishing campaign targeting the Russian nuclear industry with
Chinese language characteristics, as well as several other manufacturing and technology
companies. While much remains unknown about this newly identified campaign, we as
threat researchers now have awareness of and insight into the activity that was previously
unknown based on dogged analysis and enrichment of third-party research.
