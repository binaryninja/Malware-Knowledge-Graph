Threat Research
By Cara Lin | December 06, 2021
Last September 18th, a threat researcher released a write-up about a remote code execution
vulnerability that affects various products from Hikvision, one of the largest video surveillance
brands in the world. Hikvision is a CVE CNA and quickly assigned the CVE number, CVE2021-36260 and released a patch for the vulnerability on the same day as the threat
researcher’s disclosure. Shortly after, FortiGuard Labs developed an IPS signature to
address it.

During our analysis, we observed numerous payloads attempting to leverage this
vulnerability to probing the status of devices or extracting sensitive data from victims. One
payload in particular caught our attention. It tries to drop a downloader that exhibits infection
behavior and that also executes Moobot, which is a DDoS botnet based on Mirai. In this blog
we explain how an attacker delivers this payload through the Hikvision vulnerability, along
with details of the botnet.
Affected platforms: Hikvision Product
Impact parties: IP Cam/NVR
Impact: Attacker can exploit the vulnerability to launch a command injection attack by
sending some messages with malicious commands in the web server
Severity: Critical

Stage 0 – Exploitation and Propagation
CVE-2021-36260 results from insufficient input validation, allowing unauthenticated users to
inject malicious content into a <language> tag to trigger a command injection attack on a
Hikvision product. Below is an example of a request leveraging this exploit:

We collected a number of payloads leveraging this vulnerability, and eventually found a
downloader. After tracing the traffic capture, the complete payload is shown in the following
figure:
Figure 2. Payload from CVE-2021-36260
First, because the final Moobot will be saved as “macHelper,” it first tries to remove any file
already named “macHelper.” It then echoes code into “downloader,” which is a small ELF 32bit LSB ARM file. After downloader completes downloading, it executes Moobot with the
parameter “hikivision”. Finally, it changes commonly used commands, such as “reboot,” to
prevent an administrator from invoking reboot on the affected device.

Stage 1 - Downloader
The attacker leverages this vulnerability to drop a downloader (SHA256:
1DCE6F3BA4A8D355DF21A17584C514697EE0C37B51AB5657BC5B3A297B65955F). It
has only one job: download the main botnet. It downloads the malware with “/arm5” URI form
server 199.195.250[.]233:80 and prints “RAY” if the downloading process was successful.
The following image shows the disassembled code:

From the IP address we not only get the moobot variants for different architectures, we also
get the historic malware from directory “/h/“.

Stage 2 - Moobot
Based on our analysis, the malware (SHA256:
38414BB5850A7076F4B33BF81BAC9DB0376A4DF188355FAC39D80193D7C7F557)
downloaded in the previous stage is Moobot, which is Mirai-based. Its most obvious feature
is that it contains the data string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, which is used in the
“rand_alphastr” function. It is used to create random alphanumeric strings with different
purposes, such as for a setup process name or to generate data for attacking.

It also has some elements from Satori, which is another Mirai variant botnet. It contains a
“downloader” that targets a victim’s IoT devices, and it prints a “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p”
string after execution. This variant also forks itself with the process name “/usr/sbin*” to try to
look like a normal process while wiping out the original file, “macHelper”.

Since it is based on Mirai, the botnet also contains a data section to store its configuration.
The plaintext configuration can be decoded after XOR with 0x22:
Figure 7. Decoded data containing configuration
After getting the C2 server (life.zerobytes[.]cc) from its configuration, it starts sending
heartbeat (\x00\x00) packets and then waits for the next control command from the C2
server. Once the victim system receives the command, it starts a DDoS attack to a specific
IP address and port number. One example of the DDoS attack traffic is shown below:
Figure 8. SYN flood
The DDoS attack command is 24 bytes and can be seen in the Data section in Figure 8. This
detail is illustrated in the following figure, which includes the flood method and the target
IP/Port. Except for SYN flood, the C2 server has other attacking commands, such as 0x06
for UDP flood, 0x04 for ACK flood, and 0x05 for ACK+PUSH flood.

The complete attack scenario from trying to infect Hikvision product to deploying Moobot
is shown in figure 10:

We also noticed that a DDoS service provider based the packet capture from our machine in
Figure 11. We tracked down a telegram channel named “tianrian,” which provides a DDoS
service. They use a specific string, “openmeokbye”, in their login interface, shown in Figure
12. This channel was created on June 11, 2021, and started its service in August. From the
chatting channel we can see that the service is still updating. Users should always look out
for DDoS attacks and apply patches to vulnerable devices.

Conclusion
Hikvision is one the biggest provider of IP cam/NVR products in the global market. CVE2021-36260 is a critical vulnerability that makes Hikvision products a target for Moobot. In
this blog we showed how an attacker can leverage CVE-2021-36260 and elaborated in detail
each stage of the process.
Although a patch has been released to address this vulnerability, this IoT botnet will never
stop looking for a vulnerable end point. Because of this, users should upgrade affected
devices immediately as well as apply FortiGuard protection.

Fortinet Protections
Fortinet released IPS signature
Hikvision.Product.SDK.WebLanguage.Tag.Command.Injection for CVE-2021-36260 to
proactively protect our customers. The signature is officially released in IPS definition version
18.192.
The downloader and all related malware from that site are detected and blocked by
