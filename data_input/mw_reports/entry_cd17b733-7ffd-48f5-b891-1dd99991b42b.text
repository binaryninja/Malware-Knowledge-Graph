Update 4/22/21: A bug was discovered last night that allowed victims to recover their 7zip
password for free but was fixed soon after being discovered. You can find more info in the
update below.
Update 4/24/21: A frequently asked questions section has been added to the bottom of the
article.
A massive ransomware campaign targeting QNAP devices worldwide is underway, and
users are finding their files now stored in password-protected 7zip archives.
The ransomware is called Qlocker and began targeting QNAP devices on April 19th, 2021.
Since then, there has been an enormous amount of activity in our support forum, and the
ID-Ransomware ransomware identification site has seen a surge of submissions from
victims.

1/100

ID-R submissions from Qlocker victims
According to reports from victims in a BleepingComputer Qlocker support topic, the
attackers use 7-zip to move files on QNAP devices into password-protected archives. While
the files are being locked, the QNAP Resource Monitor will display numerous '7z' processes
which are the 7zip command-line executable.

7zip seen running in the QNAP Resource Monitor
When the ransomware has finished, the QNAP device's files will be stored in passwordprotected 7-zip archives ending with the .7z extension. To extract these archives, victims
will need to enter a password known only to the attacker.

2/100

Password-protected 7zip archive
After QNAP devices are encrypted, users are left with a !!!READ_ME.txt ransom note that
includes a unique client key that the victims need to enter to log into the ransomware's Tor
payment site.

Qlocker ransom note
From the Qlocker ransom notes seen by BleepingComputer, all victims are told to pay 0.01
Bitcoins, which is approximately $557.74, to get a password for their archived files.

3/100

Qlocker Tor payment site
After paying the ransom and entering a valid Bitcoin transaction ID, the Tor payment site will
display the password for the victim's 7Zip archives, as shown below.

4/100

The password displayed after a ransom is paid
This password is unique to the victim and cannot be used on other victims' devices.
Update 4/22/21 09:15 AM EST: Early this morning, BleepingComputer was contacted by
security researcher Jack Cable about a bug he discovered in the Qlocker Tor site that
allowed users to recover their 7zip passwords for free.
Using this bug, victims could take a Bitcoin transaction ID from a person who had already
paid and slightly alter it. When they submitted the altered transaction ID into the Qlocker Tor
site, it accepted it as payment and displayed the victim's 7zip password.
Last night, Cable had been privately helping people recover their passwords, and
arrangements were being made with Emsisoft to create a help system to better exploit this
weakness.
Sadly, an hour after we learned of the bug, the ransomware operators caught on and fixed
it.
Update: it looks like this may have been fixed by the ransomware operators,
unfortunately. I apologize if I was not able to get to yours before it was fixed. In total
decrypted around 50 keys worth $27k.
â€” Jack Cable (@jackhcable) April 22, 2021
At this point, there is no way to recover the files without a password, which can no longer be
retrieved for free.

QNAP believes attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities
5/100

Recently QNAP resolved critical vulnerabilities that could allow a remote actor to gain full
access to a device and execute ransomware.
QNAP fixed these two vulnerabilities on April 16th with the following descriptions:
More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in a blog post by the SAM
Seamless Network research team, who disclosed the bugs to QNAP in October and
November.
QNAP told BleepingComputer that they believe Qlocker exploits the CVE-2020-36195
vulnerability to execute the ransomware on vulnerable devices.
Due to this, it is strongly recommended to update QTS, Multimedia Console, and the Media
Streaming Add-on to the latest versions.
"QNAP strongly urges that all users immediately install the latest Malware Remover version
and run a malware scan on QNAP NAS. The Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Addon, and Hybrid Backup Sync apps need to be updated to the latest available version as well
to further secure QNAP NAS from ransomware attacks. QNAP is urgently working on a
solution to remove malware from infected devices," QNAP stated in a security advisory.
QNAP warns that if a device's files have been encrypted, they should not reboot the device
and instead immediately run the malware scanner.
"If user data is encrypted or being encrypted, the NAS must not be shut down. Users should
run a malware scan with the latest Malware Remover version immediately, and then contact
QNAP Technical Support at https://service.qnap.com/," advises QNAP.
While the malware scanner and security updates will not recover your files, they will protect
you from future attacks using this vulnerability.

Qlocker frequently asked questions
Trying to follow all the information in this article's comments and the Qlocker support topics
can quickly become overwhelming.
To help QNAP owners and Qlocker victims, we have put together this FAQ regarding the
attack using various contributions from QNAP users who have posted comments to this
article and the Qlocker help topic.

How are my files get encrypted?
The Qlocker threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in QNAP devices that allow them to execute
commands on your NAS device remotely.

6/100

While most ransomware operations deploy specially crafted malware programs, the Qlocker
attackers are simply scanning for QNAP devices and using vulnerabilities to remotely
launch the built-in 7zip archive utility to password-protect files.
With this type of attack, QNAP devices are not being infected with any malware but simply
being abused by vulnerabilities taking advantage of software already bundled with the
operating system.
It is unclear what vulnerabilities are being used, but it is believed to be one of the following,
which QNAP fixed this month.
QNAP has told BleepingComputer that they believe it is the CVE-2020-36195 vulnerability
that is being exploited.
Updates for all of these vulnerabilities were released earlier this month and should be
installed immediately.

My files are being encrypted! What should I do?
If you see that your QNAP files are actively being encrypted, you should immediately
disable myQNAPcloud and change the default web admin port from port 8080 to another
port number.
These changes will effectively prevent the threat actors from issuing further 7zip commands
to password-protect your files.
Now that the threat actors can no longer access your device remotely, you should terminate
any active '7z' processes that may be running to stop any current encryption commands.
You can do this by logging into your QNAP device via SSH or Telnet using the following
guide.
Then issue the following command at the console to terminate all 7z processes.
kill -9 `ps |grep sbin/7z|grep -v grep|awk '{ print $1 }'`

Is there a way to get our passwords for free?
Tuesday night, security researcher Jack Cable discovered a method that tricked the
ransomware payment site into thinking a payment was made and to display the victim's
passwords.
Unfortunately, this bug was short-lived, and the bug no longer works.
For users who have not restarted their QNAP device since being encrypted, it may be
possible to recover your password from the '7z.log' file using a command offered by a
victim.
7/100

The following command must be entered from the QNAP console when you are connected
via SSH or Telnet.
cd /usr/local/sbin; printf '#!/bin/sh \necho $@\necho
$@>>/mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log\nsleep 60000' > 7z.sh; chmod +x 7z.sh; mv 7z 7z.bak; mv
7z.sh 7z;

Once you execute the following command, you can look in the /mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log for
a 7z command-line showing your password, as shown in the example below.
a -mx = 0 -sdel -pmFyBIvp55M46kSxxxxxYv4EIhx7rlTD [FOLDER PATH]

In the above case, the password is 'mFyBIvp55M46kSxxxxxYv4EIhx7rlTD.'
A YouTube video has been created to demonstrate how to perform this task.
If you have run QNAP's Malware Remover tool, the program will have moved the 7z.log to
'/share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/MalwareRemover/7z.log'.
QNAP is emailing customers instructions with more information on possibly recovering a
password from the 7z.log file.
Unfortunately, if you have previously restarted your device, the log file contents will be
wiped.
In some cases, even if you have not restarted your device, the log file may be empty.

What has QNAP's response been?
In a security advisory released Tuesday, QNAP advises users not to restart their QNAP
devices and to run the latest version of the Malware Remover to help protect against
Qlocker.
When executed, Malware Remover will perform the following tasks:
Rename /usr/local/sbin/7z to 7z.orig
Replace /usr/local/sbin/7z to 7z.orig with this script.
The script will copy various data to the current 7z.log file and then copy that file
to '/share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/MalwareRemover/7z.log'.
Look for and quarantine the /tmp/qnap/r.py and /tmp/qnap/re.sh scripts to
the /tmp/qnap folder. If you have these scripts, we would love to see them, and you
can submit them here.
In addition to running Malware Remover, QNAP is advising users to immediately update to
the latest versions of Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Add-on, and Hybrid
Backup Sync through the App Center.

8/100

After installing the latest updates, QNAP advises customers to review their guide on best
practices to enhance NAS security.

How to decrypt multiple files at once
If you found your passwords or paid the ransom, you can use the following command
(thanks ss1973) to decrypt all of your files at once from within Windows.
SET source=C:\Users\thomb158\Downloads\5thKind\7z
FOR /F "TOKENS=*" %%F IN ('DIR /S /B "%source%\*.7z"') DO "C:\Program Files\7Zip\7z.exe" x -pPASSWORD "%%~fF" -o"%%~pF\"
EXIT

In the above command, ' SET source= ' is the path to your encrypted files, and -p is the
password. You will also need to have installed the 7zip program.
If anyone has a command to perform these steps directly through the QNAP console,
please let me know.
Update 4/24/21: Added a frequently asked questions section.

Qlocker IOCs:
Associated Files:
!!!READ_ME.txt

Ransom note text:
!!! All your files have been encrypted !!!
All your files were encrypted using a private and unique key generated for the

Hello, Sadly my qnap has been touch by this one... I'm able to go in the ssh console
but I don't know how search the password of 7z file. Could you help me for this task
please ?
10/100

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

In the console type ps -ef and press enter.
Look for a 7z command and if there is a readable password after the -p argument..

Charlie50mm - 1 year ago

I didn't find the command, but my NAS restart since the ransomware, so did I lost the
previous command line ?

11/100

aston729 - 1 year ago

You have to exit the QNAP command line by typing "0"

mirror79 - 1 year ago

not by O but by Q!

aston729 - 1 year ago

Same problem here. I can log into the SSH but after typing ps -ef nothing happens

12/100

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

No output when you type the following command and press enter?
ps -ef

aston729 - 1 year ago

Yes I already exit the Command to standard ssh comandline.
I typed ps -ef
and lookinf for 7z proccess, but it is something like this:
"/usr/local/sbin/7z a -mx=0 -sdel -p******************************** "

13/100

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

OK then this method will not work unfortunately

Marchande - 1 year ago

please tel me that al those stars are NOT a 32 character pasword

sieci - 1 year ago

and like this: 20402 admin 4368 R /usr/local/sbin/7z a -mx=0 -sdel p******************************** /share/CACHEDEV1

14/100

Marchande - 1 year ago

seems that I got nailed by this as well.. came here to monitor and see if there is ever a
fix for it... sadly my nas rebooted and updated before the encryption was completed...
thank the gods but there are still aLOT of files that did get hit... need to find a way to
decrypt every thing... posting here in hopes that some one learns something new and
has some ideas.

ValiantThor - 1 year ago

Try this command:
cd /usr/local/sbin; printf '#!/bin/sh \necho $@\necho
$@>>/mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log\nsleep 60000' > 7z.sh; chmod +x 7z.sh; mv 7z 7z.bak;
mv 7z.sh 7z;
the encryption key would be stored in /mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log which you can then
use to decrypt

15/100

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

Be terrific if this works.

Tweeterhd - 1 year ago

I just tried this option through a SSH connection, however, when trying to access the
/mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log it tells me "permission denied". Is there another way to gain
access?

16/100

Darevx - 1 year ago

Yes, i used MobaXterm to access /mnt/HDA_ROOT/ and download 7z.log, i managed
to recover password from that file. Just remember not to use the first p from that word.

AirNelly - 1 year ago

"Yes, i used MobaXterm to access /mnt/HDA_ROOT/ and download 7z.log, i

What is MobaXterm? Could you please provide some step by step instructions?
Thank you

nothing showing in the HDA_ROOT folder labled anything .log

LaurentH111 - 1 year ago

Not working ;-(

Darevx - 1 year ago

Great job, I managed to recover the password for 3 devices in this way, but I had to
download 7z.log locally to be able to open it, when I tried from the command line I
received a permissions error.

skiele - 1 year ago

There's no 7z.log in that folder unfortunately for me

18/100

micattack - 1 year ago

What can I do when I already killed the encryption process. Will it come back after a
reboot with the same password?
Currently I am leaving the qnap running and whatever the encryption was has not
come back (stopped processes, disconnected from Internet, etc)

mirror79 - 1 year ago

THANK YOU!!! You saved me from many hours of restoring backups!!! It worked! To
everybody: you must run the command from ValiantThor above, after this the 7z.log
file will reveal, download it to your local PC and open it. You will find the password
inside.

Do I have to wait sleep 60000 finish ?

NewDayMedia - 1 year ago

Sorry for my ignorance. when I try this command I get a series of permission errors:
-sh: 7z.sh: Permission denied
chmod: 7z.sh: No such file or directory
mv: can't rename "7z": Permission denied
mv: overwrite "7z"?
I am logged in with an administrator account. Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks.

keg415 - 1 year ago

It appears that as of 2021-04-11, Malware Remover now renames /usr/local/sbin/7z to
7z.orig and replaces 7z with a wrapper script that captures and logs info about the
command and parent process. And if a password option is present, it delays for a few
seconds before running 7z.orig. So if you've replaced 7z with the little
HDA_ROOT/7z.log script, Malware Remover may have renamed it instead of the real
7z and be calling it instead.
Note that on my QNAP TS-253D the log file is:
/share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/MalwareRemover/7z.log

21/100

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

Keg, would you be able to send me the original /usr/local/sbin/7z.orig and the new
helper script /usr/local/sbin/7z?
Would like to take a look and update the article with info.
Also, is this file readily accessible by anyone after they run the Malware Remover:
/share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/MalwareRemover/7z.log
Can users simply run the new version and open this file to get their password?
If you can PM so you can send me the files, it would be appreciated. I can be PMed at

cant decrypt them. Did someone found a solution to retreive the password in this
matter?

I've not tested this, but rebooting the QNAP should restore the original
/usr/local/sbin/7z executable, which Malware Remover will then rename to 7z.orig and
install the 7z wrapper script.
The command:
more "`getcfg MalwareRemover Install_Path -f /etc/config/qpkg.conf`/7z.log"
will show the wrapper script log, and (hopefully) the encryption key.

Tweeterhd - 1 year ago

I would like to thank ValientThor for a quick and helpful response in creating the 7z.log
and everyone else in this comment thread who worked to help us try to overcome this
issue. Thanks to the advice given here, commands to try, and shared youtube video
links I have seen several people who have been able to retrieve their passwords and
begin work on extracting their files. You have provided a great service to combat what
feels like terrorism. For those of you who haven't been able to retrieve your files yet,
hopefully as things progress you will have your opportunity. By the way, has anyone
seen files like these 3 on their NAS? ".wfm_upload_7htO7Z" ; ".wfm_upload_dSrQl1" ;
.wfm_upload_ez5d8Z". I stumbled across these suspicious looking files while looking
through the slew of my encrypted files and wondered if this has anything to do with
the 7z ransomeware (be gentle, a lot of this is new to me).

Another victim here. It got pretty much all of the small files on my business's NAS. I'm
not a programmer so if someone does find a fix or potential solution to decrypt the
files, please post in layman terms. I'm not totally unfamiliar with using command lines
in Windows, but I'm not as proficient on the QNAP system. Thanks in advance for
anyone looking into this.

I deleted it, but it had just one line with "php eval POST cmd" (with the missing
characters). Funny because Microsoft Defender detects that file as
Backdoor:PHP/Remoteshell.B, but the QNAP Malware Remover does not detect it.

MeanE - 1 year ago

Ooof. People let their QNAP be internet facing?

ttanxu - 1 year ago

It's UPnP that exposes QNAP. UPnP is usually by default on on routers. It's necessary
to discover devices in the same network (e.g. printer & myQNAPCloud), but it opens
up a lot of attacking surfaces for exploitation.
The truth is your home network is a lot more open to the Internet as you might have
imagined. It's especially the case if your ISP and your router have IPv6 support (and
they should).

has anyone had any luck decrypting their data. Or worse case has any one paid the
ransom successfully?

Marchande - 1 year ago

I imagine its going to be a little more dificult, since its using 7zip for the encryption,
and its appearing to be a 32 character password wich means that brute forcing it
using any of the avalable tools out will be a little challenging... ive been searching all
evening for something Im holding out hope that those that are far more versed in this
than I am are able to find a solution....

See update at top of article.

ttanxu - 1 year ago

I seriously doubt CVE-2020-36195 is the vulneribility the attacker used. I am a victim
of this attack (with 7z files created at 4/21 1AM PDT), while the QuLog center on my
affected device showed it installed Multimedia Console 1.3.4 on 3/2, Media Streaming
Addon 500.0.0.1 on 3/2 and updated its firmware to 4.5.2.1630 Build 20210406 on
4/8. They all are above the patched version QNAP announced and yet the incident
still happened.
I don't think it was affected even on 4/19, so it can't be the attacker who changed the
modified date of those 7z files. I don't think attackers were interested in changing the
software update log either.

Veyabilc11 - 1 year ago

May i know how the Qlocker got in?

micattack - 1 year ago

I am also wondering how it came in. Just 2 days ago I checked and firmware was
current. I have the suspicion that it came in through Adguard Home (docker container station) but cannot proove it. Stopped some scripts with "mana..." in the
name with "kill -9"
It got 2787 files on my qnap :-(
check via ssh with "find /share -type f -name "*.7z"|wc -l"
to see the affected directories that have encrypted files do "find /share -type f -name
'*.7z' | sed -r 's|/[^/]+$||' |sort |uniq"
so: what do we know of the attack vector and where the scripts are hiding?

34/100

Veyabilc11 - 1 year ago

How do we know that it's there already and running? Is it the 7z that shows in the
Resource Monitor?

micattack - 1 year ago

i used "top" and saw some fishy looking things - as explained with "mana" in the name
and I just killed those in my panic (kill -9 <process-id-number>)
There might be a 7z task running as well but I didnt see that and dont remember. For
now I stopped everything in the web front-end via app-center that might be running
and am working on the ssh console to debug
UPDATE: What I did probably had no effect at all. It looks like the encryption stopped
on its own at about 4:33 am CET (6-7 hours ago) so that is also why I didnt see a 7z
process running

Hi Guys. I am a victim as well. I am completely newbie in terms of NAS. Can someone

mv 7z.sh 7z;
After that, right click on 7z.log - select download and save the file on your computer.
Now you can open the file from your computer. Use the password without first "p".

Hi Darevx,
I tried with the command you suggested, but in the folder where I should find the log, I
find nothing. My client turned off QNAP after being attacked. Could this be the cause
of the missing log? Can the decryption password possibly be traced in some other
way?
Thanks in advance.
Matteo

Hello Darevx,
I managed to find the file and I downloaded it on my computer. But when I opened it
the file is completely blank - no letters or words at all. Any advice? Thanks very much.

I just registered to thank @Lawrence Abrams for all the work he is doing ... what a

I leave my QNAP turned off and untouched until later today when the update comes

Since it is personal file storage - I dont REALLY need the files and as soon as there is
hope that the files can be recovered - I am patient.

I have a NAS-473 and i am a victim of Qlocker too. I have two volumes in a storage
pool. Only the one volume's files have been encrypted.
I tried the command
cd /usr/local/sbin; printf '#!/bin/sh \necho $@\necho
$@>>/mnt/HDA_ROOT/7z.log\nsleep 60000' > 7z.sh; chmod +x 7z.sh; mv 7z 7z.bak;
mv 7z.sh 7z;
But there is no file 7z.log at all at /mnt/HDA_ROOT. This may happens because of the
two volumes?

About the 7z.log file.
What i have gatherd from reddit and qnap forum is that the encrpytion needs to still be

If anyone has paid to get the key could you post what it consists of for example
32 characters upper and lowercase with numbers and or symbols, i ask as i would like
to try some brute force attacks to decrypt and if everyone's keys are similar format it
would give a good start point.

wtutwiler70 - 1 year ago

I too am a victim, one of my two QNAP NAS was hit. I just read the recent update
(which is disappointing), and I also shut down both units, so using the mentioned
commands to find the password is unlikely an option for me either, when I do turn
them back on.
I had just done the firmware update a couple of days ago, but unfortunately, at the
time, I did not check the QNAP admin page for potential software updates.
The majority of the files on my QNAP were backups, so it will be possible to rebuild it,
if necessary (which it is sounding more and more likely), but it will take DAYS and I will
still have lost a good portion of data.
I don't use ANY of the multimedia apps on the QNAP, would uninstalling/disabling
them all help prevent this?

wtutwiler70 - 1 year ago

Ironically, when looking on the QNAP website for information on this, and possible
preventative measures, I only find articles about using the NAS to safeguard from
ransomware, and nothing (recent) about if the NAS itself was the target.

does not work. Is there a way (for whoever knows how to do that) to start the
ransomware manually on the QNAP again to generate the log file and retrieve the

oblong - 1 year ago

I'd like to thank everyone around here for the amazing input. The internet is an
amazing place!
I've too been affected. I'm a professional photographer and use my nas as my main
archive. Following good advice I have a second one at home that backs up all data
every night â€” which luckily was not affected (probably because it's not always on, it
boots up on a schedule and does its tasks, then shuts down again).
While eating breakfast this morning I was wondering why my backup was still running
(the nas sits atop my refrigerator). In the office I canceled the running backup. It was
only later today that I discovered what shenanigans caused my massive 400GB
backup job.
Thankfully my archive is approaching 10TB of data â€“ it does take a considerable
amount of time to encrypt this much data. Before I shut the whole thing down and then
found this wonderful forum I did check my more important folders and nothing was
encrypted. There were these text-notes here and there but most things were still
working â€” probably because my files tend to be large, well above 20MB. The main
machine is powered off for now.
This evening I did inspect my backup machine. Luckily it was not affected, but it did
back up the files that were encrypted on the main machine (Mostly stuff from 10 years
ago â€“ have to check my main machine soon). I'm glad my backups never delete
anything so now I have both â€“ original file + encrypted backup ;)
I'm super mad about these f***s. So much unnecessary hassle. I whish those pesky
hacking ransom wankers die a slow and painful death from covid combined with
ebola, aids and cancer. The internet is such a rotten place!

All the QNAPs I maintain have the latest software and the latest application updates
"For details, please refer to the QNAP security advisory QSA-21-11
(https://qnap.to/3eq7hy) and QSA-21-13 (https://qnap.to/3dygse).&quot;
Much newer than here, QNAP proposes, but unfortunately most of the US were hit,
after contacting the store (early Central European hours), the recommendations were
- to turn off the US.
QNAP releases in the late afternoon that it is bad and not to shut down the servers.
And here I am surprised because I say about 12 devices, half of which on average is
encrypted (some only partially), turned off for now but what next? Despite the
recommendations of QNAP, unfortunately it does not work as we would like, and most
do not intend to pay the ransom.
I went the way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq_cIdY_ksQ but on 2 tested
devices there are no such files after switching off.
And now a question for those who paid - after paying you can decrypt everything or
each file individually. We are not talking about a flat structure, but a tree.

73/100

LogicNode - 1 year ago

I manage about 8 QNAP devices right now. Yesterday I fully patched them all with the
latest firmware and also updated all of the applications. I confirmed last night that that
were all 100% up to date and secure.
Today 4 of those devices have been subject to this ransomware attack.
I can see from the time stamps on the 7z files that the attack took place some 12
hours after I updated the QNAPs!
I have being using 2FA, with super secure passwords. All unnecessary services
switched of etc. So have followed industry recommended hardening
recommendations.
Checking all the devices again now they are still all reporting up to date. No further
updates released by QNAP since I applied the fixes yesterday.
So how is it, that fully patched and updated systems are still being hacked? Could it
be that QNAP has not yet correctly identified the vulnerability the hackers are using?
Are we all still at risk?

74/100

wtutwiler70 - 1 year ago

In case any of you haven't seen this other thread, there is some good info on (1) how
to grab the password IF the 7z process is still running; (2) steps to take to lock down
all your QNAPs (without necessarily denying yourself access via the Internet, if that is
necessary for you - as it is for me); and (3) How to retrieve the deleted, pre-encrypted
files, so you don't have to go through the hassle of [paying and] extracting all those
files - but it gives you a different pain of renaming and returning the files to their
proper places.
Anyway, that thread is here:

Our developers are currently working on changing one of our brute force tools and are
hoping that a couple of people who have successfully decrypted anything / received
their password may be willing to share one of their encrypted zip files and their
received password. Note the file should be something that does not contain any
confidential information, something like a program readme file or any other random file
is fine as long as it can be decrypted, we need to validate a couple of things. If anyone
is willing please PM me.

Finally got the code but when I double click a Final Cut Pro file for example it asks me
to enter password and I do and nothing happens. What do I do??

You will need 7-zip installed to open the file, https://www.7-zip.org/
You can also try copying the file to the local desktop, test with a file with a small file
size first.

"You will need 7-zip installed to open the file, https://www.7-zip.org/

Looks like it only works on Windows, any idea how to do this on a mac??

Possibly this?

The Unarchiver seems to be duplicating the files properly but when I go into Final Cut
Pro and open the affected library my library is empty. Nothing in it

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

There are likely support files for the project around the decrypted files that are not
opening, make sure all files have been decrypted before opening projects and that
they are in the same folders as the originals.

Its crazy because I am still seeing constant failed Admin login attempts as we speak. I
am batch decrypting my files as fast as possible to get them backed up.

Can anyone tell me if there is a risk of stopping the 7z process when doing a 3 second
reset to reset the admin password. I can't find any information anywhere about
whether this will reboot the NAS.
Thanks in advance

@Fugy, I mentioned this in the other forum, but just to restate here:
Due to the nature of the attack, changing the password would be ineffective to stop it.
Creating another admin account (without the name 'admin') and disabling the default
one MAY help, but unlikely on its own. Both of these things CAN be done without
rebooting, though.

I want to buy the 0.01 bt, but I am from Peru, some support, I need to recover the
information.
The password is successful, I have windows 10?????

Hey guys, affected by this here in Ireland too. Thankfully I only recently began to use
a NAS (needless to say I regret choosing QNAP!) and I only 'dumped' files on it and I
still have the HHD with them. I managed to salvage something before it got encrypted
and I've only lost a few recent files that I can live without. I wouldn't mind finding a
password though. I shut down the NAS and rebooted it so the help from Mirror 79
here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq_cIdY_ksQ&ab_channel=LinusTechTips
might not be an option for me. Also I'm using mac and I see that there are other
issues. Hope it gets solved quickly and that those f*%*ers die a slow really painful
death

Melissa81 - 1 year ago

How has this not reached the news yet?! This is massive! It should be everywhere!
What are we to do? Will it be possible to bring back our files? Thankfully I am not a
business that has had my files encrypted but I do have 200 000 files of work and
personal life on there. Will there be a chance of re-fixing this?

This may sound obvious to some but try and unzip the encrypted files to verify it is
actually password protected. My QNAP was very recently patched. I assumed the .7z
files were Password protected after finding this article and started the process to try
and grab the password using the suggestion mentioned here. I decided to check a few
of the files after an unsuccessful attempt. No Password! I was able to extract all of the
files!

Melissa81 - 1 year ago

when I right click on an image it doesn't come up with an option to unzip it

davisdd - 1 year ago

you will need to download and install 7zip

Any chance there might be a list of valid passwords for analysis?

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

Seconded, have been asking all day and no one seems to be sharing ;)

At least we know the password is ascii-based.
Mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and 32 characters long.

Looks like an md5 of something,

There is an info block that comes back that we are looking into.

I updated the article with an example of another password displayed after making a
payment.

Tony-OZ - 1 year ago

has anyone thought of combing the files from more than one "QCRAP" NAS system
so as to share the cost of the ransom. if this works then 2 will pay 50% and 3 will pay
1/3 of the cost and so on.
Will this work?

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

The ransom is generated per device so this will not work.

88/100

Tony-OZ - 1 year ago

Yes I know but I mean copy the files of one device into the other, so you'll end up with
one device rather than two. will this work?

jj2134 - 1 year ago

How do you get the password if you pay the ransom?

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

The password would be placed on the same page where you input the transaction ID

89/100

MFR73 - 1 year ago

after entering the transaction Id. How long does it take for confirmation and
password?

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

Usually About an hour

vincentw2622 - 1 year ago

What if i close the page by accident after paying? Can i still get the password entering
the page next time?

90/100

ChrisBurchett - 1 year ago

Yes just re enter the id string they gave you and it should show

Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago

If you pay, you can always see the password again by logging into their Tor system
with your "client key".
From my tests, you do not have to enter the transaction ID again.

91/100

jj2134 - 1 year ago

I'm not able to edit the transaction ID field after entering my key. Any help? I can't
delete it or type.

Got nabbed by this this morning. Files started converting around 4 am EST (4/22/21).
I was using my laptop at my office and luckily happened to be looking in our archive
folders (main purpose of NAS besides camera DVR) and actively saw files being
replaced.
immediately unplugged everything and shutdown the NAS.
Luckily for me only local network devices had started propagating the new files and I
was able to use a remote PC as a source for the originals after updating, cleaning and
restoring everything.
IMMEDIATELY Bought a backup drive for our backup server and will being taking
weekly snapshots off-site from now on. It was an eye-opening experience. (our files
are mostly docs and PDFs and a 3yr archive is only about 100 gb)
I wish I could turn off ALL outside access, but unfortunately one of the main purposes
of our QNAP was the abilty for remote cloud service and IP cam DVR w/ remote
viewing (Everything thing else is disabled except qcloud......)
Shout out to ValiantThor for a awesome command for getting the password, I just wish
I caught it an hour earlier while 7z was still running)
BEST of luck to all those affected, and my hopes for a full recovery of all your stuff

jhy - 1 year ago

Could the password be in the client key? Might help if those who paid the ransom post
their password and client key.

imalek - 1 year ago

Update 4/22/21 09:15 AM EST: Early this morning, BleepingComputer was contacted
by security researcher Jack Cable about a bug he discovered in the Qlocker Tor site
that allowed users to recover their 7zip passwords for free.
Using this bug, victims could take a Bitcoin transaction ID from a person who had
already paid and slightly alter it. When they submitted the altered transaction ID into
the Qlocker Tor site, it accepted it as payment and displayed the victim's 7zip
password.
Last night, Cable had been privately helping people recover their passwords and
arrangements were being made with Emsisoft to create a help system to better exploit
this weakness.
Sadly, an hour after we learned of the bug, the ransomware operators caught on and
fixed it.

If you decide to pay the ransom, make sure immediately change passwords and back
up your files. You are still a target for another attack. Paying the ransom does not
make you safe from falling a victim again. I have been constantly getting failed Admin
access attempts. Protect your self.

I've turned off uPnP port forwarding but I'm getting constant admin login failed
notifications. I'm trying to get all my files off my QNAP and will need it to run overnight
but I don't want them to hack my NAS again. What can I do to ensure they can't
access my NAS? I've updated everything

wtutwiler70 - 1 year ago

@AIrNelly
Have you tried creating a different account with administrator privileges, and disabling
the default admin account? This seemed to take care of the login failures for me, as it
is no longer a valid account to log in with.

ss1973 - 1 year ago

I created a new admin with a different username and password. A friend of mine had
me change my port numbers. And turn on secured https. This has been a stressful 2
days I pray their is some kind of class action suit against QNAp.

Marchande - 1 year ago

so now that we know that the password is 32 characters long, I wonder if it woudl be
possible to either generate a dictionary file using just 32 character ascii passwordes
and run it through hascat and see if its possible to brute force it... thought not sure
how long something like that could take to both compile and or brute force ...

hi, but if i pay the ransom to recover my files can i take legal action against qnap since
this problem was caused by them?

ozstar - 1 year ago

I have got PuTTY on my Win 10x64 (which I have never used before) and given it my
admin and pwd for the NAS but what do I do now? The cursor just blinks.

vincentw2622 - 1 year ago

try this out and dont reboot your nas

Hi Salvo, After making the payment they give your password successfully?

Chris10eS - 1 year ago

I was affected by the attack as well (the Nederlands). Noticed that not all files were
encrypted. But unfortunately the business ones wewe all. Luckely i had switched off
the back up possibility, by turning off the main nas straight away, My backup files are
all okay. No 7z or read me text to be found.

Boydy81 - 1 year ago

Ok so I have an interesting story I noticed yesterday that I was hit by the qlocker as I
was working on an After effects file and the file all of a sudden didn't show up, I looked
closer as the 7z file was on the end, this brought me to this thread. The NAS had to
be turned off due to Electrical works being done at my house, after looking into this
further and from QNAP support themselves they pretty much said that because the
NAS has been turned off it useless now, (who is unless you say?) So I have recently
turned the NAS back on for a quick look at the files and noticed all my larger files are
still there Pics are not however I have had the Edited ones backed up on Dropbox.
Can someone recommend how I get the Malware off ? or should I just get the Videos
etc off and start again. Just to add to this I do a lot of my Business stuff through
dropbox so lucky not off my NAS.
