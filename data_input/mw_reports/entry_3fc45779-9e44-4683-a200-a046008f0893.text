Introduction - Signed XLL File Delivers Buer Loader
FortiGuard Labs has discovered a malicious spam campaign that uses the names of two
well-known corporate entities as a social engineering lure to trick a target into opening a
maliciously crafted Microsoft Excel document. When opened, the document contacts a

1/8

remote server that downloads a malicious payload from a predefined website. What makes
this campaign different from similar malicious spam campaigns is the use of a signed
Microsoft Excel file with an .XLL file extension, rather than the standard .XLS file extension.
In this blog, we will examine details of this attack as well as the infrastructure they used. The
reader will see the multi-step process used to ensure that the target would be infected,
including evasive steps to bypass detection technologies via the .XLL file extension and the
use of a valid signed digital certificate.

What Exactly is an XLL File Extension?
An XLL file extension is used by Excel Add-in files to allow third party applications to add
extra functionality to Excel. XLL files are similar in structure to DLL files. They allow for calls
of specific Excel commands, worksheet functions from Visual Basic (VBA), registered XLL
commands, and from functions referenced in Excel. The use of XLL files is not as common
as a maliciously crafted XLS file that contain macros or exploits, so it is a rarely observed
evasion tactic used by threat actors to bypass endpoint detection.
Complicating things even further, the malicious XLL file used in this campaign (at the time of
analysis) is signed with a valid digital signature and chained accordingly. Signed malware
containing valid digital certificates are used by threat actors to evade detection as they are
trusted by antivirus and other endpoint security software. Because a company or
organization is vetted by a certificate authority (CA) before the issuance of a digital
certificate, operating systems and anti-virus software treat files signed with these certificates
as clean, which ultimately allows the signed file to operate with impunity.
And finally, when run, the maliciously crafted Excel file connects to a predetermined server to
download the payload, which in this case is Buer Loader.

Campaign Details
The modus operandi of these attackers is spam email. Based on our observations, these
attacks do not appear to be targeted, but instead appear to be blanketed campaigns looking
for low hanging fruit—i.e., anyone willing to open the malicious attachment.
The email in the example below is a variant of the classic shipment courier status email, with
this variation using DHL and Amazon trademarks as the lure. This specific example was sent
to an individual and not to an organization, further reinforcing the idea that these campaigns
are not targeted.
This malicious spam appears to be rushed or the product of non-native English speakers as
there are grammatical issues—“We sincerely sorry due to inconvenience...”—which makes it
less than convincing, even to the untrained observer.

(Incidentally, the recipient of this particular email has had their email username and
password posted online previously. And according to haveibeenpwned[.]com, this email
address has also been exposed in four separate breaches.)
Contained within the email is an attachment with the file name “Detailed Invoice.xll.” Looking
at the attachment we can see that it is digitally signed and chains appropriately. The digital
signature is assigned to HORUM, with a reference email address of admin[@]khorum[.]ru:

The certificate appears to be valid until 3/24/2022:

The Infection Chain
When the user opens the XLL file, the Excel file triggers on xlAutoOpen in a similar fashion
to a macro. The following image shows the export name is the same.

The export attempts to contact the following URL:
hxxp://dmequest[.]com/dme/images/portfolio/products/1/csrsc.exe hosted on 68[.]67.75.66.
Analysis reveals that the IP address serving the executable file belongs to a webhosting
reseller in Florida in the United States. Further analysis shows that this is most likely a
compromised server and, based on experience, it is probably controlled by affiliates of the
bad actors or the bad actors themselves.
Taking a deeper inspection of the server we see that it contains an open directory that is
public. In the folder where csrsc.exe resides, a directory timestamp appears to have been
changed to look like it is one of the original files from 2016. However, analysis revealed that
the csrsc.exe file was actually compiled in 2021.

The directory also contains several other files from June 2021 that may be from a different
campaign. We have also observed older campaigns over the past several years being
downloaded from this same IP address. Some of these campaigns involve serving fake data
recovery software as well as PayPal themed phishing sites. However, it is difficult to
determine if these attackers are all related, or if this is simply a leased server used by
multiple threat actors.
A passive DNS entry of domains that resolved to this IP address highlights a variety of
businesses entities, but overall, they appear to be a random collection of websites of
customers belonging to the webhosting reseller.
Once the XLL file finishes downloading csrsc.exe, the downloaded file is saved as:
%PUBLIC%\srtherhaeth[.]eXe

Further Insight into srtherhaeth.exe
The downloaded file is Buer Loader. First discovered in 2019, Buer Loader is Malware-as-aService that was first used by threat actors to deliver banking Trojans and various other
malware. As it gained popularity it was later adopted by Ryuk threat actors to help establish
an initial foothold on targeted networks. Once this foothold was established, the infamous
Ryuk ransomware was then deployed. Buer Loader has evolved since then and the following
provides further insight into this latest version.
Analysis of srtherhaeth.exe reveals what is likely an invalid or expired signature, and
because of this it did not chain appropriately and could not be verified as a legitimate
certificate.

Further examination of the file revealed the following:

RUST Crates and Toolchains
srtherhaeth.eXe is almost 2 MB. In the world of malware, files in this size range are not
common. This is a newer variant of Buer loader that has been completely rewritten, as first
pointed out by ProofPoint in May of 2021. A deeper dive reveals that it was written in RUST
and uses RUST crates/libraries, which explains the file size anomaly versus traditional
malware.
Consistent with the latest version of Buer Loader, this version was observed incorporating
the whoami (https://github.com/libcala/whoami) RUST crate, which allows for details such as
current user info including username, full name, preferred language, OS name/version, and
environment it is located in. The version used is whoami-1.1.1, which was released on 202103-13 (https://github.com/libcala/whoami/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
One interesting component of RUST are toolchains. In layman’s terms, RUST toolchains are
collections of programs along with multiple dependencies needed to compile a RUST
application.
RUST toolchains observed used so far by Buer were:
ureq 2.0.2
A minimal HTTP request library
minreq
A simple, minimal-dependency HTTP client with less features than ureq.
A user-agent string of “something/1.0.0”
Ring
According to the official site, Ring is a safe, fast, small crypto focused on generalpurpose cryptography. It uses RUST with BoringSSL's cryptography primitives.
Finally, the file receives additional instructions from its command and control (C2) server:
hxxps://shipmentofficedepot[.]com (195[.]123.234.11).
Insight into C2 shipmentofficedepot[.]com. (195[.]123.234.11)
Detailed analysis over a 30-day period revealed a large majority of connections from USbased victims (66%), followed, interestingly enough, by Mozambique (22%), Singapore (5%),
and other countries at (1% or less).

A cursory review of our telemetry indicates that over 1/3 of the traffic occurred over port 22
(SSH/SFTP). Almost all of these port 22 connections originate from a reportedly
compromised server. Since this is a shared server hosting multiple websites, this information
indicates that the provider may not mind hosting malicious websites.

Conclusion
While the use of malicious XLL files is not new, it is rarely used. But couple that with the fact
that a valid digital signature was used (at the time of the attack) and the level of
sophistication and resourcefulness of these attackers increases in the minds of threat
researchers. Even though the email lure used was basic, this may only indicate that the
group behind this campaign was simply testing the effectiveness of their techniques.
However, the techniques used in this campaign are harder to spot than the average attack.
The examples in this blog highlight a carefully thought-out campaign by the attacker, who
took the needed time and steps to ensure that their work would not be detected before
infection. Thankfully, Fortinet customers running the latest definition sets are already
protected against this campaign.
