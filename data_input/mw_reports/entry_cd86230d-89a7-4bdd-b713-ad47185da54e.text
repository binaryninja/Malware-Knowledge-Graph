Fake Interview: The New Activity of Charming Kitten

Introduction
Certfa Lab has identified a new series of phishing attacks from the Charming Kitten1, the
Iranian hacking group who has a close relationship with Iran’s state and Intelligence
services. According to our investigation, these new attacks have targeted journalists, political
and human rights activists. These phishing attacks are in line with the previous activities of
the group that companies like ClearSky2 and Microsoft3 have reported in detail in September
and October 2019.
As we previously reported the activities of the Charming Kitten in 20184, our research
indicates the Charming Kitten is still trying to target private and government institutions, think
tanks and academic institutions, organizations with ties to the Baha’i community, and many
others in European countries, the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, to extract
information from them.
Our findings show that these new attacks by Charming Kitten are focused on stealing email
account information of the victims and finding information about their contacts/networks.
Also, our research shows that the group has recently participated in designing a malware for
Windows machines but the spectrum and the number of its targets is still not clear for us.

Phishing via Fake Interviews
Phishing is one of the main tactics that has been used by the Charming Kitten, and social
engineering and fake emails are the usual methods of executing it. In this campaign, the
Charming Kitten has used the identity of a former Wall Street Journal (WSJ) journalist and
created a fake interview scenario to target their victims. It must be noted that in the recent
months, the group has used scenarios like “Invitation to a Deutsche Welle Webinar” and
“CNN Interview” with the related topics of Iran and international affairs in order to trick their
targets.

Step 1 - Gaining Trust: In one of the cases, the hackers forged the New York Times
journalist Farnaz Fassihi’s identity as a Wall Street Journal reporter - where she used to work
- to send interview request emails to victims and guide them to their phishing websites. In the
first step of the fake interview, emails were sent from farnaz.fassihi [at] gmail [dot] com to
gain the victims’ trust. The below image is a sample of the content.

Translation:
Hello *** ***** ******
My name is Farnaz Fasihi. I am a journalist at the Wall Street Journal newspaper.
The Middle East team of the WSJ intends to introduce successful non-local individuals
in developed countries. Your activities in the fields of research and philosophy of
science led me to introduce you as a successful Iranian. The director of the Middle
East team asked us to set up an interview with you and share some of your important
achievements with our audience. This interview could motivate the youth of our
beloved country to discover their talents and move toward success.
Needless to say, this interview is a great honor for me personally, and I urge you to
accept my invitation for the interview.
The questions are designed professionally by a group of my colleagues and the
resulting interview will be published in the Weekly Interview section of the WSJ. I will
send you the questions and requirements of the interview as soon as you accept.
*Footnote: Non-local refers to people who were born in other countries.
Thank you for your kindness and attention.
Farnaz Fasihi

In these emails, all the links in the footnotes (Figure 2), including social media links, WSJ
and Dow Jones websites, are all in the short URL format. As a result, by clicking on them,
the hackers can guide the victim to legitimate addresses while getting basic information
about the victim’s device such as IP address, the type of Operating System, and the browser.
This is a common method of gathering information by hackers in order to prepare for the
main attacks based on the victims’ devices.

Step 2, The Main Attack: After communication and relative trust are established through the
initial email, hackers send their victim an exclusive link as a file that contains the interview
questions. According to our samples, the Charming Kitten has been using a page that is
hosted on Google Sites (Figure 3). This method is a relatively new tactic that has been

2/7

widely used in phishing attacks by hackers in the past year6 in order to make the targets trust
the destination domain, for example this URL: hxxps://sites.google[.]com/view/the-wallstreet/xxxx. By using this tactic, the hacker can evade the spam detections.

After clicking the download button on the Google Site page (Figure 3), the target is sent to
another fake page in two-step-checkup[.]site domain where login credential details of his/her
email such as the password and two factor authentication (2FA) code are requested by
phishing kits.
The structure of the phishing page is listed below:
hxxps://two-step-checkup[.]site/securemail/secureLogin/challenge/url?ucode=xxxxxxxx&service=mailservice&type=password
hxxps://two-step-checkup[.]site/securemail/secureLogin/challenge/url?ucode=xxxxxxxx&service=mailservice&type=smscode
hxxps://two-step-checkup[.]site/ymail/secureLogin/challenge/url?ucode=xxxxxxxx&service=mailservice&type=password
hxxps://two-step-checkup[.]site/ymail/secureLogin/challenge/url?ucode=xxxxxxxx&service=mailservice&type=smscode
Using phishing kits such as Modlishka7 to steal passwords and two factor authentication
codes is an important step in targeted attacks, which has been widely used by hackers in the
past year and many reports have been written about them8. As mentioned, Certfa Lab
published an extended report in 2018 about the Charming Kitten and their use of this
method. Figure 4 is a sample of the phishing page that was used to steal the SMS
authentication code.

Malware Development
One important point that caught our attention in this campaign was using “pdfreader.exe”, a
piece of malware with a backdoor feature. Our investigation shows this file was first uploaded
in VirusTotal by an anonymous user on 3 October 20199.
The technical assessment of the malware’s function shows that the developers of malware
are directly in contact with the people behind the recent phishing attacks, and it could be
interpreted as all these malicious activities being done by one group, which we believe to be
the Charming Kitten.

pdfReader.exe Function: This malware, which is identified as a Win32/Backdoor by
antiviruses, is a mid-level piece of malware - due to lack of design sophistication - with
various harmful capabilities. Our assessment shows the malware causes changes in the
Windows’ Firewall and Registry settings in order to run automatically itself and gathers
information from the victim’s device and sends it to its developer. This feature allows the
hackers to run new malware and spyware remotely on the victim’s target. Figure 5 shows the
process graph of this malware.

pdfReader.exe Connections: A noteworthy point about this malware is its connection and
interaction with 51.89.237.234 on port 80. Before its original version was uploaded on
VirusTotal on 03 October 2019 11:00:25GMT, pdfreader.exe was submitted on VirusTotal as
a pdfreader.zip four hours earlier, on 3 October 2019 07:14:22GMT, which can be seen in the
IP history 51.89.237.233 (Figure 6). Also, the server with IP address of 51.89.237.234 is
used to host “software-updating-managers[.]site” and “malcolmrifkind[.]site”.

Charming Kitten’s Footprints
Our research on the history of phishing websites in recent attacks, such as two-stepcheckup[.]site, shows the attackers use “ns11025.ztomy[.]com” and “ns21025.ztomy[.]com”
as the Name Servers (NS) on 14 October 2019. These servers were previously used for
other phishing websites by the Charming Kitten.
The similarities between the method of managing and sending HTTP requests in “two-stepcheckup[.]site” server with the latest techniques used by this group is further evidence of
Charming Kitten’s connection to these attacks. In this technique, if sent requests to the host
server of the phishing kit are denied, the user is directed to a legitimate website like Google,
Yahoo!, or Outlook by “301 Moved Permanently” and “Found redirect 302” responses. As a
result, this method makes it harder for different pages and sections of phishing websites to
be exposed to the public.
Figure 7 is a sample of public requests from “two-step-checkup[.]site” that has been
redirected to outlook.live.com. In this scenario, the user does not have a valid request
according the phishing kit, therefore, the real webpage - not the phishing one - is shown to
the target.

Another noteworthy point about the footprints of the Charming Kitten in this campaign is the
similar settings that have been used for servers. Our research shows that in the second half
of 2019, most servers used by the Charming Kitten were based on Windows machines and
OpenSSL, PHP, Apache, and Microsoft-HTTP API or similar versions. Although this point is
not enough to prove this claim, the default settings in response to HTTP requests can be the
group’s footprint. A few examples are listed below.

The Range of Attacks
Assessments of the network infrastructure that was used in these attacks shows the
Charming Kitten uses a variety of servers and domains to trap its targets. Some of these
servers and domains are related to the recent attacks and some occurred during the second
half of 2019. Table 1 lists the latest domains and IPs of the Charming Kitten and Table 2 lists
the related domains and IPs.

Conclusion
This new series of phishing attacks by the Charming Kitten are in line with previous activities
seen from their group. For example, we identified similar settings for the servers used in this
attack with their previous campaigns.
The main focus of this phishing campaign was stealing email account information of the
victims, and finding information about their contacts/networks. One example detailed in this
report is there impersonation of public figures such as a WSJ reporter.
The Charming Kitten used Google Sites for their phishing attack, and Certfa believes that
they work on the development of a series of malware for their future phishing attack
campaign.
