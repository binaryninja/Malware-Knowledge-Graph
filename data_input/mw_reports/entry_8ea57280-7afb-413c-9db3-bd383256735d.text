Lookout Security Intelligence has discovered Android and iOS surveillanceware tools
targeting government officials, diplomats, military personnel, and activists, specifically in
Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iraq, and the UAE. Additionally, data from U.S., Australian, and
German officials and military have been swept up in the campaign we believe is being run by
members in the Pakistani military.
We're calling these surveillanceware families Stealth Mango (Android) and Tangelo (iOS).

GPS coordinates pulled from the EXIF data of exfiltrated images is centered around
Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Lookout Security Intelligence team alerted Google to the existence of Stealth Mango
during our investigation. The company states: "Google identified the apps associated with
this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been
updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from
all affected devices."

Phishing and distribution

Phishing message sent through Facebook Messenger.
The actors behind Stealth Mango typically lure victims via phishing messages sent by fake
Facebook personas, but in some cases may have used physical access to victims' devices.
As was the case with previous actors we've reported on, such as Dark Caracal, the actor
behind Stealth Mango has stolen a significant amount of sensitive data from compromised
devices without the need to resort to exploits of any kind.

Exfiltrated content
The majority of this content we analyzed has information that would be of great interest to a
nation state actor. This includes:
Letters and internal government communications

3/11

Detailed travel information
Pictures of IDs and passports
GPS coordinates of pictures and devices
Legal and medical documents
Developer information including whiteboard sessions, account information, and test
devices
Photos of the military, government, and related officials from closed door meetings
including U.S. Army personnel
‍

Details around travel in and around Pakistan from Australian diplomats.
‍

4/11

Exfiltrated content was found to contain military photos including a series of images from an
event with military attendees from numerous countries including U.S. Army personnel.
‍

Attacker personas

We have also identified, as part of this investigation, several individuals who we believe are
responsible for the development of other commodity Android and iOS spyware tools that
share many similarities to Stealth Mango and Tangelo. These individuals all belong to the
same freelance developer group for hire, which says it has a physical presence in India,
Pakistan, and the United States.

behind this nation state surveillanceware, and a list of the indicators of compromise by
