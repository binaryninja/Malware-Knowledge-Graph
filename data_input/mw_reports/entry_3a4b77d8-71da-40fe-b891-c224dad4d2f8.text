Recently, Cyble Research Labs came across a new malware sample on the surface web. The malware
in question belongs to the Wiper family. The sample was posted by a security researcher
on Twitter. From VirusTotal, we learned that the original name of the malware is【至急】東京オリンピッ
ク開催に伴うサイバー攻撃等発生に関する被害報告について.exe. The translation of the file name
is “[Urgent] About the damage report about the occurrence of cyber-attacks etc. accompanying
the Tokyo Olympics .exe”.
In this case, the name of the sample suggests that it could be used to leverage the interest surrounding
the Tokyo Olympics.
The Wiper malware family has been created with the intent to delete selected documents
containing extensions that are predefined in the malware by the Threat
Actor (TA). Figure 1 showcases the complete execution flow of the Wiper malware.

Technical Analysis
The static analysis of the malware indicated that it is packed using Ultimate Packer for Executables
(UPX), an open-source executable packer that supports various file formats across operating systems.
After unpacking the malware, we found that it is an x86 architecture console-based application. It
was developed using C/C++ language and compiled on “2021-07-20 06:52:05”. These details are
shown in Figure 1. The malware also uses an Adobe PDF icon to trick unsuspecting users into opening
the malware.

Figure 2: Malware’s Static Details
Based on our initial observations, Cyble researchers found that the malware doesn’t perform
any other activities apart from deleting itself from the victim’s device. Similarly, we can see in
Figure 3, that the malware executes the “Del” command to delete itself.

Code Analysis
Our research indicates that the TA behind the malware has added multiple anti-VM/antidebugging/AntiSandBox techniques, as
shown in Figure 4, These techniques include checking for ProcMon, VM Detection, Debugger Detection,
Sleep, and EnumWindows etc.

Using EnumWindows API Call, the malware checks if any strings mentioned in Table 1 are
matching any running processes in the top-level application titles to check whether
any malware analysis tools are running in the background.

Our research indicates that the Wiper malware also checks for the processes shown in Table 2 to
determine if it is running in any malware analysis environment. In case these processes are running, the
malware exits and deletes itself.

Table 2: Process List
Figure 5 shows the malware comparing the running processes with the process list.

The malware also checks whether any soft breakpoint has been added on a VMDetection method or
not, as shown in Figure 6.

breakpoints
The TA has added the above checks to ensure that the malware runs on the physical device and not on
any malware analysis environment. If any one of the checks is positive, the malware exits and deletes
itself.
Once all the checks are done, the malware executes a series of commands to delete the files that have
the extension specified by the TA in the malware, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Malware Executing Command to Delete *.doc Files
The series of commands used to delete files that have the extensions specified by the TA are given in
Table 3.
del /S /Q *.doc c:\\users\\%username%\\ > nul
del /S /Q *.docm c:\\users\\%username%\\ > nul
del /S /Q *.docx c:\\users\\%username%\\ > nul

del /S /Q *.exe c:\\users\\%username%\\ > nul
del /S /Q *.log c:\\users\\%username%\\ > nul
Table 3: Commands Executed by Malware
As we can see in Table 3, the malware checks for several file extensions including .jtd, which is an
extension for a Japanese word processor.
Once it executes all the commands given in Table 3, it runs the curl command to access an adult
website. However, the intent of this behavior is unknown.
Figure 8 shows the execution of the curl command to access the adult website.

The malware self-destructs after completing all the activities discussed above.

Conclusion
Based on the name of malware executable file, “[Urgent] About the damage report about the
occurrence of cyber–attacks etc. accompanying the Tokyo Olympics .exe”, and the fact that the
malware checks for. jtd extensions,we suspect that it has been potentially created to leverage the recent
interest around the Tokyo Olympics.
The TA provided this malware with the functionality to delete files that have extensions specified by the
TA. It does not demonstrate any other behavior that is generally displayed by malware.
