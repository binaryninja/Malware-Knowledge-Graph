Technical appendix: malware samples
and indicators of compromise (IOC)
A. Keylogger module
File name: varies
MD5: a3cbf6179d437909eb532b7319b3dafe
Compilation timestamp: 2012.10.02 10:51:50 (GMT)
Compiler: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
File format: PE32 DLL
Exports: _LowLevelKeyboardProc@12
Creates the log file: %TEMP%\~DFD3O8.tmp. If failed, tries to write to the file f:\keyhook.log
Each time the keylogger starts, it appends the following header to the log file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Session: %fully qualified computer name% %timestamp%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It then creates a hidden console window and registers its only export _LowLevelKeyboardProc@12
as a hook procedure for low-level keyboard input events (WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook).
Depending on the results, it writes a line to its log file. In case the hook was installed, the line is
“Started...”, else “LoadLibrary ‘%path to its file%’ failed, %error code%”.
It also starts a thread that retrieves the current foreground window handle every 100 milliseconds.
This handle is then used in the keyboard hook procedure.
The low-level keyboard hook procedure intercepts WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP and WM_
SYSKEYDOWN system messages and writes information about each keystroke to the log file. Every
time a new window becomes active, it retrieves its name and the path to its application and writes
this information to the log file:
[%path to the application’s executable file%: “%window title%”]

B. The “Epic/Tavdig/Wipbot” backdoor (Main backdoor module)
Analyzed file (others are similar):
Compilation timestamp: 2013.10.15 10:43:09 (GMT)
File format: PE32 DLL, modified (the file is supposed to be started by a custom loader)
Exports:
1000837F: ModuleStart
100083A9: ModuleStop
100083BB: start
The main functionality is implemented in a single function that is called by the DllMain entry point.
The exported functions allow to call the same function directly (exported as “start”) or to start/stop
it in a separate thread (“ModuleStart”/”ModuleStop”) and with slightly different parameters. This
indicates the backdoor can also function as a plugin for the Turla Carbon system.
The main function executes in an infinite loop. It collects most of the available information about the
system, transmits it to the C&C server and executes the commands it receives back. The module delays
execution for random periods while it discovers running processes with one of the following filenames:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

tcpdump.exe
windump.exe
ethereal.exe
wireshark.exe
ettercap.exe
snoop.exe
dsniff.exe

The following system information is collected:
1.

2.
3.

Hardware information.
• Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\
SystemInformation, value names: SystemManufacturer, SystemProductName.
• All registry subkeys of the key HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor, value
name: ProcessorNameString.
• Available system memory status, total/free.
OS version information; the newest version known to it is Windows 7 / 2008R2. Unidentified
versions are marked as “not support this version of Windows”.
Computer name (“ComputerNamePhysicalDnsFullyQualified”).

User name, local group name.
Common directory names: system, current, temporary directories.
Additional system information:
• System and user language settings
• User locale information: country name, current date, time zone.
• Uptime
Disk space information for all available logical drives.
List of available network shares.
List of all user accounts, privilege classes, time of the last logon.
List of current IPV4 TCP connections and UDP listeners.
Information about installed Windows updates from the file
%WINDOWS%\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log.
Detailed list of running processes and their owners.
List of all window titles.
Directory listing of available logical drives and of the directories:
• Desktop
• %TEMP%
• %WINDOWS%\Temp

The retrieved information is compressed using bzip2, encrypted with AES and then encoded using
Base64 before being transmitted to the C&C server. When there is a file waiting for upload (usually,
this is file that contains the results of the previously received and executed command), it is read
from disk and uploaded to the server instead of the system information.
The C&C communication is implemented on top of the standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols. The list of
the C&C URLs is hardcoded in the binary but may be overridden by further commands.

C&C server communication cycle

The module uses Wininet API functions for issuing HTTP POST requests to the server. The module
transmits the collected information in the body of the POST request and gets new commands from the
server’s response. The request body can be empty if there is no new information to upload. The response
is usually an HTML document and the commands are Base64-encoded strings enclosed in <div>/</div>
tags. Every command is encrypted using asymmetric encryption with temporary AES session keys.
Each command is a mixed text/binary buffer. It consists of two parts: payload and configuration.
The configuration is an INI file that controls the further behavior of the module. It is extracted
into a temporary file named %TEMP%\~D%random%.tmp. The payload, if exists, is supposed to be an
executable file and may be executed if there is a corresponding command present in the INI part.
The format of the decoded command is the following:

Format of the C&C command buffer

Available commands are:
Name

Description

exe

Execute a command, redirect its output to the file %TEMP%\~D%random%.tmp.

down

Change the C&C URL to a given value.

del_task

Delete a file.

result

Set the filename that is supposed to contain the results of command
execution. Effectively, any existing file may be marked for upload by this
command.

TLP: Green

The file is then uploaded during the next C&C communication cycle.

Name

Description

delete

Mark the file %TEMP%\~tmp085.dat to be deleted on reboot.

name

Set the filename to be deleted or created (depends on other parameters)
