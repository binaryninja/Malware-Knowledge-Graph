AgentTesla [S0331] a.k.a Negasteal is a .NET-based Remote Administrator Tool (RAT) first
detected in 2014. It is advertised as a Remote Administrator Tool since then. AgentTesla
allows adversaries to remotely control the systems of victims and manipulate them
accordingly, so it is utilized by numerous threat actors such as SILVERTERRIER, SWEED,
Aggah, etc.
Initially, it only had remote administrator capabilities but after various iterations and
upgrades, recent variations are capable of spying on victim systems, capturing sensitive data
such as credentials, and users’ actions by recording screen and keylogging, stealing
credentials from browsers and mail clients, and exfiltrate those collected data using various
techniques. The interesting part is, it has the capability to extract data from a large number of
browsers and mail clients and utilizes various protocols to exfiltrate those data. The malware
utilizes various obfuscation techniques such as software packing [T1027.002], and encoded
payloads [T1027] to evade defense.

It has been spreading rapidly in the wild with CISA listing it in the Top Malware Strains list for
the year 2021 and it still is in the top 10 list on MalwareBazaar as of March 2023.

The operators of AgentTesla are providing Malware-as-a-Service with various pricing options
for different versions of the malware. During the year 2017, the malware’s website was
available on the public internet (now on the dark web), and advertising about the RAT
capabilities with various price ranges and features.

The price shown above has likely been changed. It is provided for reference purposes purely
to show that AgentTesla provides multiple buying options and operates a business-like
model. AgentTesla has been used in numerous campaigns by multiple threat actors as it is
available to be bought at various price ranges with various capabilities and support from the
operators. In 2022, CERT-UA discovered AgentTesla being deployed in their state
organization systems through phishing attachments [T1566.001]. Besides Ukraine, the
AgentTesla malware was also seen being deployed in a data theft campaign by threat actors
tracked as Aggah against East European countries.

Infection Chain
It all starts with phishing attachments, whereby victims are lured to execute malicious
attachments. It can range from LNK files to Office documents with malicious macros or
payload to exploit vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-0199 (Remote code execution
vulnerability in Microsoft Office Application and WordPad) and CVE-2017-11882 (Remote
code execution vulnerability in Microsoft office).
Once the initial payload is executed, it tries to connect to the malware distribution site and
download other stages of payload, and finally downloads AgentTesla into the system. The
initial payload can also directly download the malware without dropping other payloads. After

AgentTesla is in the system, various actions are performed such as persistence, credential
harvesting, and exfiltration.
For persistence techniques the malware schedules tasks [T1053] or places itself in startup
folders or under registry Run keys [T1547.001]. In the case of data collection, what we have
observed is that it has a predefined list of browsers, mail, and VPN client. Based on
whichever mentioned services and application is present in the system, it tries to retrieve
data from them. For exfiltration, we found various samples of AgentTesla utilizing various
protocols and applications such as SMTP, FTP, Telegram, and Discord.
We go into full detail on how the malware is being distributed, and the infection chain and
provide an analysis of its capabilities in the attached report. We uncover some of the TTPs
from the analysis of malware and case studies. After understanding its capabilities we have
provided detection rules to detect the malware at various stages through its known behavior
which is available to download as part of Logpoint’s latest release, as well as through
Logpoint’s download center (https://servicedesk.logpoint.com/hc/enus/articles/115003928409).
