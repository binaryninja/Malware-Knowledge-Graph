A few weeks ago, a mid-sized, 24/7 media company that had moved critical activities online
during the pandemic, found itself locked in live combat with REvil ransomware attackers
determined to secure a multi-million-dollar pay-out. The attack failed, but the company has
yet to fully recover.
In early June 2021, a detection of Cobalt Strike on the network of a mid-size media company
triggered a security alert. Cobalt Strike is a remote access agent that is widely used by
adversaries as a precursor to ransomware attack.
Attackers released ransomware a few hours later at 4 am local time. For the next four hours,
the target’s IT team and Sophos’ Rapid Response team were locked in live combat with the
human adversaries orchestrating the attack.
The attack ultimately failed, but not before the attackers encrypted the data on unprotected
devices, deleted online backups, and decimated one online and undefended domain.
The ransom note left on encrypted devices demanded a payment of $2.5 million and was
signed by REvil, also known as Sodinokibi.

How it began
1/5

REvil is a ransomware-as-a-service offering, which means that criminal customers can lease
the malware from the developers and then use their own tools and resources to target and
perform the attack. The target for this particular REvil customer was a media company with
approximately 600 computing devices – 25 of them servers – and three Active Directory
domains, which were critical to the company’s ability to maintain its 24/7 operations.

The rush to remote and online operations
Like so many organizations during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the target
had rushed to equip and enable a remote workforce, and not all devices carried the same
level of protection. The company also decided to internet-connect a network that was
previously air-gapped. Unfortunately, these actions would come back to bite them.
Once the intruders were inside the network, they made straight for the unprotected devices
and other online systems they could gain access to, installing their attack tools and using
them to spread the attack to other devices.

The unfolding attack
When Sophos’ Rapid Response team arrived on the scene, they discovered that the
attackers had already managed to compromise a number of accounts and had been able to
move unimpeded between unprotected computers.
“One of the biggest challenges for incident response is a lack of visibility about what’s
happening on unprotected devices,” said Paul Jacobs, incident response lead, Sophos. “We
can see and block inbound attacks coming from these devices to a protected endpoint, but
we can’t centrally remove the intruder from those devices or see what they’re up to.”
The team also looked at the software applications installed on devices to check for any that
might be used as part of the attack.
“As a result of the pandemic, it’s not unusual to find remote access applications installed on
employee devices,” said Jacobs. “When we saw Screen Connect on 130 endpoints, we
assumed it was there intentionally to support people working from home. It turned out the
company knew nothing about it – the attackers had installed the software to ensure they
could maintain access to the network and compromised devices.”
This was just one of several mechanisms the attackers implemented to maintain persistence.
The attackers also created their own domain admin account as a fallback after stealing
another set of domain admin credentials.

Hand-to-hand combat

“As the attack became noisier, the attackers knew they would be detected and blocked. We
could tell that they knew we were there, and they were doing everything they could to defeat
us,” said Jacobs. “Our security products have a behavioral feature called CryptoGuard that
detects and blocks attempts to encrypt files even if the source is a remote, unprotected
device. Once we started to see such detections, we knew the ransomware had been
unleashed and the battle was on.”
The attackers tried repeatedly to breach protected devices and encrypt files, launching
attacks from different unprotected devices they had been able to compromise.
Every attempt needed to be blocked and investigated to ensure there was nothing else going
on and that there was no further damage – even though by then the next attack attempt was
already underway. This task was made harder than normal because the organization needed
to keep most of its servers online to support the 24/7 broadcasting systems.
Eventually, the onslaught began to slow down. By day two, inbound attacks were still
detected intermittently but it was clear the main attack attempt was over and had failed.

The aftermath
As the incident responders and the company’s IT security team took stock, they found that
damage was mainly limited to the unprotected devices and domains. The previously airgapped, online domain was completely destroyed and needed to be rebuilt and online
backups had been deleted, but the company wasn’t totally crippled by the attack, and it didn’t
need to pay the exorbitant ransom. Despite this, the return to full operations has been a slow
process and is ongoing at the time of publication.

The lessons learned
“In most cases, by the time we are called in the attack has already taken place, and we are
there to help contain, neutralize and investigate the aftermath,” said Peter Mackenzie,
manager of Sophos Rapid Response. “On this occasion we were there as the final stage of
the attack unfolded and could see at first hand the determination and growing frustration of
the attackers, who threw everything at us, from as many directions as they could.”
Sophos experts believe there are two important lessons defenders can take away from this
incident:
1. The first is about risk management. When you make changes to your environment, for
example, changing a network from air-gapped to online as in the case of this business,
your level of risk changes. New areas of vulnerability open up and IT security teams
need to understand and address that

2. The second is about preserving data. The first compromised account in this attack
belonged to one of the IT team. All the data had been wiped and this meant that
valuable information, such as details of the original breach, which could have been
used for forensic analysis and investigation was lost. The more information is kept
intact, the easier it is to see what happened and to ensure it can’t happen again

Recommendations
Sophos recommends the following best practices to help defend against REvil and other
families of ransomware and related cyber-attacks:
1. Monitor and respond to alerts – Ensure the appropriate tools, processes, and
resources (people) are available to monitor, investigate and respond to threats seen in
the environment. Ransomware attackers often time their strike during off-peak hours, at
weekends or during the holidays, on the assumption that few or no staff are watching
2. Set and enforce strong passwords – Strong passwords serve as one of the first lines
of defense. Passwords should be unique or complex and never re-used. This is easier
to do if you provide staff with a password manager that can store their credentials
3. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) – Even strong passwords can be compromised.
Any form of multifactor authentication is better than none for securing access to critical
resources such as e-mail, remote management tools, and network assets
4. Lock down accessible services – Perform scans of your organization’s network from
the outside and identify and lock down the ports commonly used by VNC, RDP, or other
remote access tools. If a machine needs to be reachable using a remote management
tool, put that tool behind a VPN or zero-trust network access solution that uses MFA as
part of its login
5. Segmentation and Zero-Trust – Separate critical servers from each other and from
workstations by putting them into separate VLANs as you work towards a zero-trust
network model
6. Make offline backups of information and applications, keep them up to date and
keep a copy offline
7. Inventory your assets and accounts – Unprotected and unpatched devices in the
network increase risk and create a situation where malicious activities could pass
unnoticed. It is vital to have a current inventory of all connected computers and IOT
devices. Use network scans and physical checks to locate and catalog them
8. Install layered protection to block attackers at as many points as possible – and
extend that security to all endpoints that you allow onto your network
9. Product configuration – Under-protected systems and devices are vulnerable too. It
is important that you ensure security solutions are configured properly and to check
and, where necessary, update security policies regularly. New security features are not
always enabled automatically

10. Active Directory (AD) – Conduct regular audits on all accounts in AD, ensuring that
none have more access than is needed for their purpose. Disable accounts for
departing employees as soon as they leave the company
11. Patch everything – Keep Windows and other software up to date. This also means
double checking that patches have been installed correctly and, in particular, are in
place for critical systems like internet-facing machines or domain controllers

Additional advice for security leadership
1. Understand the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that attackers can use
and how to spot the early warning signs of an imminent attack
2. Have an incident response plan that is continuously reviewed and updated to reflect
changes in your IT environment and business operations and how they impact your
security posture and level of risk
3. Turn to external support if you don’t have the resources or expertise in house to
monitor activity on the network or respond to an incident. Ransomware is often
unleashed at the end of attack, so you need both dedicated anti-ransomware
technology and human-led threat hunting to detect the tell-tale tactics, techniques, and
procedures that indicate an attacker is in or attempting to get into the environment
4. If you do get hit, there are incident response experts available 24/7 you can call on to
contain and neutralize the attack
