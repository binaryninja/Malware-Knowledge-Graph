In Part 1 of this four-part blog series examining wiper malware, we introduced the topic of wipers,
reviewed their recent history and presented common adversary techniques that leverage wipers to
destroy system data.
In Part 2, CrowdStrike’s Endpoint Protection Content Research Team discusses how threat actors
have used legitimate third-party drivers to bypass the visibility and detection capabilities of security
mechanisms and solutions.

Third-Party Drivers
For a wiper developer, there are several good reasons to switch operations into kernel space.
When it comes to overwriting disks, user mode has certain limitations and is intensely monitored
by AV/XDR vendors through hooking various APIs and blocking select actions. With the release of
Windows Vista, Microsoft began restricting access to raw disk sectors from user mode. To bypass
this, wiper developers began to drive their attack through the kernel space.
Threat actors may attempt to write their own kernel drivers, but this approach is difficult for a
number of reasons. One is related to the lack of segregation between processes or drivers in
Kernel space; anything can write to anywhere with no restriction. With no room for error, the
1/15

machine may easily destabilize and crash. Another is that modern Windows 64-bit requires drivers
to be signed by Microsoft.
Rather than writing their own kernel drivers, malware authors often resort to using drivers
developed by third-party entities in order to achieve their goals. Some notable examples of wiper
families that use third-party drivers include Destover, DriveSlayer, Shamoon, Dustman and
ZeroCleare. Most of these leverage different versions of the ElRawDisk driver developed by
Eldos, with the exception being DriveSlayer, who uses a driver developed by EaseUs.

ElRawDisk Driver
The ElRawDisk device driver, developed by Eldos (now part of Callback Technologies), is used
by several wiper families such as Destover, ZeroCleare, Dustman and Shamoon. The driver is
used as a proxy to transfer actions from user mode into kernel mode and ensures that all disk
operations are done on behalf of the driver, not the wiper process. This technique removes any
limitations user mode processes might encounter when writing files or interacting with the disk
directly. Since this is a third-party driver, the malware must implement a way to install it on the
infected machine. Usually this is achieved by dropping the driver to disk and loading it via the
Service Control Manager APIs, or the sc.exe tool. Legitimate drivers are also seen as “clean” by
security vendors and it would not be blocked when they are installed.
ZeroCleare and Dustman use an unsigned version of ElRawDisk driver that is loaded using Turla
Driver Loader (TDL). TDL installs a signed and vulnerable VBoxDrv driver. This driver is exploited
to mimic the functionality of a driver loader and the unsigned ElRawDisk driver is mapped in kernel
mode without having to patch Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).
After loading the driver, the wipers must grab a handle to it via CreateFile and provide a key in
order to authenticate to the driver. The key is appended to the device name, and parsed out by the
driver. If no valid key is supplied, the return value will be INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE. While this
seems like a good idea to limit unauthorized access to the driver, in reality threat actors can
reverse engineer the legitimate applications that use the ElRawDisk drivers and extract a copy of
the key. Then they use that key to impersonate the legitimate tool and achieve their goals.
Analyzed wipers use different keys for the ElRawDisk driver.

Shamoon retrieves information about the location of the file on the raw disk by sending the
FSCTL_GET_RETRIEVAL_POINTERS control code to the ElRawDisk device via the
DeviceIoControl API. This information is later used to determine the raw sectors of the file that
needs to be wiped.

Figure 2. Send FSCTL_GET_RETRIEVAL_POINTERS via DeviceIoControl API

Shamoon attempts to wipe the entire disk, not only the files. In order to do so, it requests
partitioning information by sending the IOCTL_DISK_GET_PARTITION_INFO_EX IOCTL to the
ElRawDisk driver. The partitioning information helps the wiper to determine what sectors to
overwrite. To accomplish this, the wiper opens a handle to a specific partition via CreateFile and
overwrites the sectors using WriteFile and SetFilePointer APIs. Shamoon writes a JPEG image to
the sectors, rendering the operating system unstable and may crash at any point in time.

The code trace from Figure 4 exemplifies how wipers overwrite raw disk clusters by proxying
activity via the ElRawDisk device.

Figure 4. API trace view demonstrating how the EPMNTDRV is used to wipe the disk

ZeroCleare and Dustman use the driver a bit differently than Shamoon. Once the ElRawDisk driver
is loaded using TDL and a handle to the driver is obtained, it calls DeviceIoControl using one of
two different IOCTLs (0x22BF84 or 0x227F80), depending on the Windows version. This call is
capable of overwriting the contents of the physical drive with a message (as in Dustman wiper), or
a buffer with the same byte value (as in ZeroCleare wiper).
The following figure is used in both ZeroCleare and Dustman wipers. The customdata buffer
contains the data that is used to overwrite the contents of the physical drive.

Figure 5. How ZeroCleare and Dustman use the ElRawDisk to overwrite the disk with a custom buffer

As seen in the ElRawDisk driver version used by Dustman and ZeroCleare, both these two IO
control codes translate to the same function call. The following snippet cannot be found in the
driver used by Shamoon because it’s an older version.

EPMNTDRV Driver
EPMNTDRV is another example of a driver developed by a legitimate entity being used for
malicious purposes by threat actors. This driver is developed by EaseUs for their partition
manager utility. Back in March of 2022, the DriveSlayer wiper used this driver against Ukraine. It
was kept inside a LZA compressed resource and loaded via the Windows Service Control
Manager APIs after it was written to disk by the malware. In the following figure, we can observe
the main function of the EPMNTDRV driver. It creates the device and a symbolic link followed by
initialization of the DRIVER_OBJECT structure with the necessary dispatch routines.

Figure 7. Main function of the EPMNTDRV initiating various dispatch routines

Similarly to the previous driver, it allows any user-mode process to interact with the disk by
proxying actions through itself. Interaction is achieved via dispatch routines like IRP_MJ_CREATE,
IRP_MJ_WRITE as well as IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL. To interact with the driver, the process
needs to open a handle to the device via CreateFile and provide a path like “\\.\EPMNTDRV\
[value]”, where [value] represents the ID of the disk. The driver will then allow the user to operate
on the “\Device\Harddisk[value]\Partition0” device through it.

Figure 8. Pseudocode view of the IRP_MJ_CREATE dispatch routine from EPMNTDRV driver, showcasing how
it opens a handle to the local disk (\Device\Harddisk%u\Partition0)

In the IRP_MJ_CREATE routine of the driver, a pointer to the “\Device\Harddisk%u\Partition0” is
obtained via IoGetDeviceObjectPointer and IoGetAttachedDeviceReference APIs and stored in
a global variable to be later used in the other dispatch routines.

8/15

Figure 9. Pseudocode view of the IRP_MJ_WRITE dispatch routine from EPMNTDRV driver, showcasing how an
IRP request is created and sent to the driver handling the HardDisk device.

The IRP_MJ_WRITE handles the write requests coming from the user mode process.and forwards
them to the driver handling the disk operations. In order to achieve this, the driver makes use of
the IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest API to construct an IRP request and sends it to the driver
via the IofCallDriver API.

9/15

Figure 10. Pseudocode view of the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL dispatch routine from EPMNTDRV driver,
showcasing how IO control codes are forwarded to the HDD device driver

The the user mode process send a IOCTL to the EPMNTDRV device, the dispatch routine
handling IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests is called and it forwards the requests to the driver
handling disk operations via the IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest and IofCallDriver APIs.

Figure 11. Pseudocode from DriveSlayer displaying how to data is sent to the third-party driver in order to
overwrite the disk

Now that the EPMNTDRV driver is installed, the wiper can grab a handle to it via CreateFile and
use standard WriteFile and DeviceIoControl APIs in order to send data to the driver. All requests
from user mode are then forwarded to the disk driver. Now, the malware can now wipe the MBR,
MFT, and files on behalf of the legitimate driver.

Summary
Multiple wiper families leverage legitimate third-party kernel drivers as proxies for running
malicious activities. This provides the wipers with multiple advantages; enabling them to operate in
a stealthy manner and bypassing several security products. A kernel implant provides limitless
capabilities for the attacker, including easy access to the entire disk, without the operating system
getting in the way. Many of the wipers we’ve analyzed use legitimate drivers to wipe raw disk
sectors and, in some instances, protected files. The main weakness of this approach is that wiping
raw sectors will destabilize the operating system, making it liable to crash at any moment.
Crashing the OS may be in the victim’s advantage because this would halt wiping operations and
potentially allow the victim to recover some of their data.
In Part 3 of this wiper series, we will discuss additional and less frequently utilized techniques
implemented by various wiper families.
