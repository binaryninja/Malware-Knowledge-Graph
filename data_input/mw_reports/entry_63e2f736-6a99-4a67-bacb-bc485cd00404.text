We are seeing a continuation of even more AgentTesla malspam campaigns again this
morning. However today’s is somewhat different to usual and also delivers a Nanocore RAT.
Actually the Nanocore RAT is downloading the AgentTesla keylogger. And after a bit of
digging around and seeing an Open Directory listing on the AgentTesla download site we
found another multi-stage JavaScript downloader which delivers what looks like Dunhini
/Houdini /h-worm and WSHRAT along with more Nanocore or at least using the same C2
and download structures as recent nanocore samples.
Once again the scumbags sending these are using ISO attachments, which generally
speaking are very badly detected by antiviruses, mailscanners or perimeter defences. Many
AV and “next gen” anti-malware services do not routinely scan an ISO file but rely on
detecting the extracted file. This is one of the few file types that you are actually slightly safer
using Windows 7.

1/6

You need a 3rd party extraction (unzipping) program to extract the executable content from
the container. Winzip & Winrar along with several other 3rd party unzipping tools does do
this, but are not set to open iso files by default, so need a few clicks from you to do it.
Windows 7 will natively try to open the ISO in Windows ISO burner and copy it to a cd/dvd
for you. Whereas the more modern & “safer” OS W8.1 and W10 will normally offer to mount
the ISO. This means open it as a virtual cd drive so the .exe file is shown in file explorer
ready for you to click on & run. While the exe file is inside the ISO container it is safe and will
not harm you. It should not automatically run when mounted.
Many ISO do have an auto-run command embedded ( for example Microsoft Windows 10 or
Office downloads) , but I can’t see one in these.
You can now submit suspicious sites, emails and files via our Submissions system
Jabil.com has not been hacked or had their email or other servers compromised. They are
not sending the emails to you. They are just innocent victims in exactly the same way as
every recipient of these emails. I first saw the sending IP / Server being used yesterday in a
fake DHL campaign delivering a very similar JS downloader contacting many of the same
sites.

NEW_PO_1205356266,pdf.iso ( VirusTotal) extracts to NEW_PO_1205356266,pdf.exe
VirusTotal | Anyrun | Which is the nanocore binary. The C2 for this nanocore is microsoft.btccrypto-rewards.cash 160.202.163.246
2/6

This downloads and autoruns the AgentTesla binary
http://mechanicaltools.club/download/2oxEJ50zPS4Wsdb.exe virusTotal | Anyrun |
The C2 / SMTP exfiltration for this AgentTesla is smtp.vivaldi.net 82.221.130.149 but I can’t
easily determine the email address of the miscreant.
Now when we looked at the download site for AgentTesla mechanicaltools.club we found an
Open Directory listing with lots of files.
This domain was only registered yesterday 24 June 2021 using privacy protection via
Namecheap as registrar and hosted by Namecheap. The home page has a default hosted by
Namecheap holding page. This was obviously registered by these criminals to be used in
malware campaigns.
This set of files tries to download the same nanocore that was inside the ISO container. I
assume there must have been an email with links, that would trigger the download chain.
The bad actors have made a bit of an error by starting the chain with a MHT file
http://mechanicaltools.club/download/mhtexp.mht ( VirusTotal ) which only work in
Internet Explorer and display as plain text in other browsers and will not offer the
downloaded next step in the chain.
http://mechanicaltools.club/download/mhtexp.php which simply downloads
http://mechanicaltools.club/download/mhtexp.hta (VirusTotal) which in turn downloads & runs
http://mechanicaltools.club/download/mhtexp.js VirusTotal | Anyrun | which is a heavily
encoded scripting file that downloads and runs these 3 files which are actually renamed .exe
files not zip files at all. But all are very well detected on VirusTotal
http://doughnut-snack.live/klplu.tar.gz VirusTotal | Anyrun |

All the alleged senders, companies, names of employees, phone numbers, amounts,
reference numbers etc. mentioned in the emails are all innocent and are just picked at
random. Some of these companies will exist and some won’t. Don’t try to respond by phone
or email, all you will do is end up with an innocent person or company who have had their
details spoofed and picked at random from a long list that the bad guys have previously
found .
The bad guys choose companies, Government departments and other organisations with
subjects that are designed to entice you or alarm you into blindly opening the attachment or
clicking the link in the email to see what is happening.
