Executive Summary
According to a from 3xp0rt, Ali Qushji was able to infiltrate LockBit’s server and acquire
the builder for the ransomware
According to , Proton, one of the programmers for the LockBit ransomware group,
mentioned that the builder was leaked,
The ransomware group indirectly admitted that the allegations above are true, saying
that nothing has been hacked and that they have fired the coder.
LockBit 3.0 Builder leaked by Ali Kushii and Proton are both shared on .

Detailed Analysis

1. Build.bat
Build.bat creates an RSA public/private key pair by executing Keygen.exe , and
Builder.exe that generates a LockBit 3.0 ransomware using the generated key pair.

3. Builder.exe
Builder.exe is a tool to generate LockBit 3.0 Encryptor and Decryptor. Encryptor and

Decryptor are embedded in the resource section.

5/8

100: LockBit 3.0 Decryptor (EXE)
101: LockBit 3.0 Encryptor (EXE)
103: LockBit 3.0 Encryptor (DLL)
106: LockBit 3.0 Encryptor (Reflective DLL)
The parameters used during execution are as follows.
-type
enc: Generate Encryptor
dec: Generate Decryptor
-config
Configuration file path
-exe, -dll, -ref(reflectiveDLL)
File type to be created
-pass
When creating an Encryptor, the password required to execute the Encryptor
Passwords required to execute Encryptor are stored in Password_exe.txt and
Password_dll.txt respectively
-pubkey, -privkey
Path of the key file to be used when creating Encryptor and Decryptor
-ofile
File path to save

4. Keygen.exe
Keygen.exe is a tool that generates key pairs required for encryption. The parameters

used during execution are as follows.
-path : Folder path to save generated key pair file
-pubkey : File name to use for Encryptor as public key (256 bytes)
— The first 128 bytes contain e value (fixed at 65537), and the last 128 bytes contain N
value
-privkey : File name to use for Encryptor as private key (256 bytes)

6/8

— The first 128 bytes contain d value and the last 128 bytes contain N value
Key generation is performed as follows.
keygen.exe is written based on .
Generates an RSA-1024 key to encrypt the file encryption key, and the value is fixed to
65537.
When generating 512-bit prime numbers and , create a 256-byte seed with the x86
instruction.
Then, pass the seed to the function of MIRACL to initialize the CSPRNG defined in ,
and use the function to get a 512-bit value, which will be used for generating a prime
number.
The keygen.exe uses a modified version of MIRACL, which uses instead of SHA-256
inside the CSPRNG from .
Afterward, a 16-byte Decryption ID is generated to identify the infected PC and stored in the
DECRYPTION_ID.txt file.
