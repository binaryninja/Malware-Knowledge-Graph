threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/08/29/sectorj04-groups-increased-activity-in-2019/

Abstract
SectorJ04 is a Russian-based cybercrime group that began operating about five years ago
and conducted hacking activities for financial profit using malware such as banking trojans
and ransomware against national and industrial sectors located across Europe, North
America and West Africa.
In 2019, the SectorJ04 group expanded its hacking activities to cover various industrial
sectors located across Southeast Asia and East Asia, and is changing the pattern of their
attacks from targeted attacks to searching for random victims. This report includes details
related to the major hacking targets of the SectorJ04 group in 2019, how those targets were
hacked, characteristics of their hacking activities this year and recent cases of the SectorJ04
group’s hacking.

SectorJ04 group activity range and hacking methods
The SectorJ04 group has maintained the scope of its existing hacking activities while
expanding its hacking activities to companies in various industrial sectors located in East
Asia and Southeast Asia. There was a significant increase in their hacking activities in 2019,
especially those targeting South Korea. They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their
backdoor to the infected system that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s
server.

Main countries and sectors targeted
The SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were financial institutions located in countries
such as North America and Europe, or general companies such as retail and manufacturing,
but they recently expanded their areas of activity to include the medical, pharmaceutical,
media, energy and manufacturing industries. They do not appear to place much restrictions
on the sectors targeted. The following are the sectors and countries under which SectorJ04
group was found in 2019.

Hacking Techniques
The SectorJ04 group mainly utilizes a spear phishing email with MS Word or Excel files
attached, and the document files downloads the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation file from
the attacker server and uses it to install backdoor on the infected system. As anti-virus
programs have recently begun to detect MSI files, in some instances macro scripts contained
in the malicious documents would install backdoors directly onto infected systems without
using MSI files.

Figure 3 Schematic drawing for SectorJ04 group’s hacking method
Malicious documents used for hacking are mainly written as themes related to MS Office,
and the same themes are often used several times, with only language changes depending
on the victim’s language.
In addition, the MSI files backdoor used by SectorJ04 mostly had valid digital signatures, and
most of their malware were signed just days before they were found.

Main Malware Used
The SectorJ04 group mainly used their own backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy RAT,
for hacking. They also used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) RAT, a legitimate remote
management software created in Russia. Backdoors are installed in infected systems and
they also distributed email stealers, botnet malware and ransomware through those
backdoors.
They were recently confirmed to use additional backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi,
which is used to install other backdoor such as FlawedAmmyy RAT on behalf of the MSI file,
or to collect system information and send it to the attacker’s server.

Backdoor installed in the infected system distributed additional botnet malware, ransomware
and email stealers. The email stealer collects connection protocol information and account
information, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, which are stored in the registry by Outlook and
Thunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a specific format.

An email stealer may also have a file collection function to collect email information that is
recorded in the metadata of the file corresponding to the hard-coded extension. In addition,
the malware eventually creates and executes a batch file for self-delete, removing the
execution traces from the infected PC.

The SectorJ04 group is believed to collect email accounts stored in infection systems for use
in subsequent attacks.

Characteristics of hacking activities of SectorJ04 group in 2019
The following are the features of the first half of 2019 activities identified through the analysis
of the SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities.
Increased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia
Changes in spam email format and hacking methods
Changes in targets of hacking from specific organizations and industry groups to large
number of irregular ones
Although the SectorJ04 group mainly targeted countries located in Europe or North America,
it has recently expanded its field of activities to countries located in Southeast Asia and East
Asia. In particular, the frequency of hacking attacks targeting South Korea has increased,
and spam emails targeting China were found in May.
The changes could also be seen in attachments to spam emails used by attackers. Existing
spam emails used attachments in the form of malicious documents, but attachments with
HTM and HTML extensions were also found and the text included links to download
malicious documents directly.

7/28

The SectorJ04 group’s initial spam emails had no mail content or only short sentences, but
the latest spam emails found were elaborately written and included images. A new type of
backdoor called AdroMut and a new malware called FlowerPippi was also found coming from
SectorJ04.
Prior to 2019, the SectorJ04 group conducted large-scale hacking activities for financial gain
using exploit kits on websites to install ransomware, such as Locky and GlobeImporter, along
with its banking Trojan, on its victims computers. But after 2019 the group has changed its
hacking strategy to attack using spam email. In particular, a number of remote control
malware are utilized to gain access to resources such as email accounts and system login
information from the infected machine to send more spam emails and distribute their
malware.

Increased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia
The hacking activities of SectorJ04 group, which targeted South Korea in the first half of
2019, have been continuously discovered. The emails found were written in relation to
invoice and tax accounting data, and were attached the MS Word or Excel files with
malicious macros inserted. Malicious documents written in Korean have the same
characteristics as other language hacking activities under the theme of MS Office.

Figure 10 Spear phishing emails disguised as order sheets
In June 2019, continuous hacking activities targeting South Korea were found again and
spam emails were written with various contents, including transaction statements, receipts
and remittance cards. During that period, a number of spam emails disguised as remittance
cards of the same type were found.

8/28

Figure 11 Spear phishing email disguised as a remittance card
The SectorJ04 group has carried out large-scale hacking activities targeting South Korea,
while also expanding the field of attacks to Southeast Asian countries such as Taiwan and
the Philippines. Spam emails and attachments written in Chinese were found in May, and the
SectorJ04 group at that time targeted industrial sectors such as electronics and
telecommunications, international schools and manufacturing.

Figure 13 Malicious excel file execution screen written in Chinese
Changes in spam email format and hacking methods
In June, SectorJ04 group conducted hacking using spam emails written in various
languages, including English, Arabic, Korean and Italian, and the emails were written with
various contents, including remittance card, invoice and tax invoice.
Along with the existing method of using MS Word or Excel files as attachments, they used
HTML files to download malicious documents as attachments, or included links to download
malicious documents directly in the text.
In the past, the emails used in attacks had little or no content, but the latest ones use
elaborated spam emails for hacking, such as using images.

Changes have also been found in the hacking method of the SectorJ04 group. In addition to
their preexist backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy, they have also been confirmed to
use the backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi.
AdroMut downloads the malware (ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy RAT) used by the
SectorJ04 group from the attacker server and simultaneously performs the functions of a
backdoor.
FlowerPippi collects infection system information, such as the domain of the infected system,
proxy settings, administrator rights, and OS version, and performs functions such as
executing commands received, downloading and executing DLL and EXE files.

Figure 17 RC4 key with hard-coded view from the FlowerPippi back door
The SectorJ04 group is believed to have developed and used malware that functions as a
downloader for the purpose of installing or downloading malware to replace the MSI
installation files that they have used for hacking for more than six months as the detection
rate of security solutions increased.

Figure 18 Some of the digital certificate information identified in the corresponding hacking
activity
The SectorJ04 group, which has been utilizing the same pattern of infection and the same
malware for more than six months, is believed to be attempting to change its infection
methods such as downloading malware directly from malicious documents without using MSI
installation files, changing their spam email format and using new types of backdoor.

Changes in hacking targets from specific organizations and industries to random
ones

12/28

Until 2019, SectorJ04 group had carried out massive website-based hacking activities that
mainly utilize ransomware and banking trojans for financial profit, and has also been carrying
out information gathering activities to secure attack resources such as email accounts and
system login information from users since 2019.
This allows them to expand their range of targets of hacking activities for financial profit, and
in this regard, SectorJ04 group has been found to have hacked into a company’s internal
network by using a spear phishing email targeting executives and employees of certain
South Korean companies around February 2019.
They eventually hacked the Active Directory (AD) server and took control of the entire
corporate internal network, and then distributed the Clop ransomware on the AD server.
From the hacking activity, we also found malware for collecting email information and
“AmadeyBot”, a botnet malware that which has its source code available in Russia’s
underground forums.

Figure 19 Spear phishing email used for hacking activities targeting AD servers in South
Korea
They are believed to have continuously attempted to hack into companies in South Korea to
distribute Clop ransomware. Attackers used spam emails disguised as being sent by the
National Tax Service in May to install FlawedAmmyy RAT in the infected system, during
which the Clop ransomware was found using the same certificate as the FlawedAmmyy RAT
executable file.

Figure 20 Spear phishing email disguised as tax bill
The SectorJ04 group has shown a pattern of hacking activities that have changed from
targeted attacks to a large-scale distribution of spam.

Major Malware Installation Types
The following describes three types of backdoor infections that are installed from malicious
documents identified in the SectorJ04 group-related hacking cases that occurred during the
first half of 2019.
Type 1 – Using encoded executable file
SectorJ04 group carried out intensive hacking on various industrial sectors, including South
Korea’s media, manufacturing and universities, around February and March 2019. They
used the spear phishing email to spread malicious Excel or malicious Word files, and
downloaded the MSI files from the attacker’s server when the malicious documents were run.
The MSI file installs a downloader that downloads FlawedAmmyy RAT encoded in the
infection system from the attacker server, and the downloaded FlawedAmmyy RAT registers
an automatic execution under the name “wsus.exe.”

Figure 21 Type of backdoor installation to install encoded executable file Type 1

14/28

FlawedAmmyy RAT performs remote control functions in the infected system and decodes
encoded executable files downloaded from the attacker server using certain hard-coded
strings. It also has a function to check if a particular process is running to determine whether
their malware should be executed.

Figure 22 “Ammy Admin” string found in FlawedAmmyy RAT

Figure 23 Part of decode code that uses hard-coded strings
Type 2 – Using NSIS Script
SectorJ04 group conducted hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in India
and Hong Kong around April 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear
phishing email downloaded the MSI file, which forwards the NSIS Installer to the infected
system. The NSIS script executes the final payload, ServHelper, in the DLL file format, using
“rundll32.exe”.
Note that NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a script-based installation system for
Windows and is a lightweight installation system supported by Nullsoft.
15/28

Figure 24 Backdoor installation type utilizing NSIS Installer Type 2
Decompressing the NSIS installer installed by the MSI file shows that it consists of an NSIS
script with an NSI extension, a ServHelper in the DLL file format, and a “ncExec.dll,” the
normal DLL required to run the NSIS.

Figure 25 Uncompressed NSIS installer

Figure 26 Part of the NSIS script for running ServHelper in the DLL file format
ServHelper performs the function of the backdoor in the infection system and sends specific
types of responses to C2 servers using delimiters such as “key,” “sysid,” and “resp”. Different
types of delimiters are sometimes found depending on malware.

Figure 27 ServHelper Backdoor C2 Communication Code Partial
Type 3 – Using Self-Extracting File
SectorJ04 group carried out hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in Italy
and other countries around May 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear
phishing email pass MSI files to the infection system, and MSI files download the executable
16/28

self-extracting file (SFX). When the SFX file is executed, another SFX file inside is executed
and the final payload, RMS RAT, is delivered to the infected system.

Figure 28 Backdoor installation type utilizing SFX executable files Type 3
Within the first SFX file to be downloaded by the MSI file, there are four files. When
executing an SFX file, it uses a command to change the extension of the SFX file
(“kernel.dll”) of the DLL extension to EXE and decompress it using a hard-coded password.
The files that make up the SFX file vary from malware to malware.

Figure 29 The first SFX file to be downloaded from an MSI file

Figure 30 “i.cmd” for decompression of the second SFX file

17/28

Four files can be seen in the second SFX file that has been decompressed, and as before,
running “exit.exe”. “exit.exe” executes the same “i.cmd” as before, which executes an RMS
RAT with the file name “winserv.exe” in the registry. RMS RAT is a legitimate remote
management software created in Russia, and files with DAT extensions contain configuration
information to run the RMS RAT.

SectorJ04 Group Activity in South Korea
The following is about the activities of the SectorJ04 group found in South Korea in July and
August 2019.
Hacking activities disguised as electronic tickets by large airlines
In late July, SectorJ04 group used FlawedAmmyy RAT to carry out hacking attacks on
companies and universities in sectors such as education, job openings, real estate and
semiconductors in South Korea. Spam emails targeting email accounts used in the

18/28

integrated mail service of public officials were also found in the hacking activity.

Figure 33 Spam email disguised as electronic tickets
They used spam emails disguised as those sent by large South Korean airlines and used
ISO-format files as attachments. The group used the same body contents of the email to
deliver spam emails to multiple hacking targets.
Decompressing the ISO file attached to the spam email would show an SCR file disguised as
a “.pdf” extension exists, which is a .NET executable file that downloads an MSI file. The ISO
files sometimes contain LNK files, which, like the malware written in .NET, download an MSI
files from a remote location.

The following valid digital signatures were found in the MSI file downloaded from the attacker
server. Other digital signatures were also found issued by “HAB CLUB LT” and “LUK 4
TRANSPORT LT”.

Finally, FlawedAmmyy RAT is downloaded from the remote server and the activity uses a
Base64 encoded Powershell script to determine if the infected system is a PC contained in
an Active Directory Domain.

Hacking activity using same email content as the past
In early August, the SectorJ04 group carried out extensive hacking activities targeting the
users around the world, including South Korea, India, Britain, the United States, Germany,
Canada, Argentina, Bangladesh and Hong Kong.

20/28

Their activities were particularly heavy in healthcare-related areas such as healthcare,
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare-wage management, as well as energyrelated companies such as gas and wind power. Also, they continued their attacks on
preexisting hacking target areas such as manufacturing, distribution and retail.
The contents of the text written in French and English were found in the spam email, and an
MS Word file with random numbers was used as an attachment. All emails found in the
hacking activity had the same text content.

Figure 39 Spear phishing emails written in French and English
Spam emails in Korean were also identified in the hacking activity, indicating that the
contents of the text of the email used in the hacking activity were reused in June. Attached
file is an MS Word file titled “스캔_(random number).doc”.

Figure 40 Spear phishing email targeted to South Korea using the same text used in the past

21/28

The MS Word file used as an attachment is disguised as an order confirmation and a goods
receipt. Running the macro from the document would allow the downloader with the DLL file
format to run using “rundll32.exe”. The downloader downloads FlawedAmmyy RAT from the
attacker server and runs under the name “rundl32.exe”.

FlawedAmmyy RAT found in the hacking activity showed the existing “Ammyy Admin” string
being modified to “Popss Admin” and created Mutex with “KLGjigjuw4j892358u432i5”. In
addition, the compile path “c:\\123\\123\\clear\\ammyygeneric\\target\\TrFmFileSys.h” was
found inside the file.

In addition to the above mentioned changes in the FlawedAmmyy RAT found in the most
recent hacking activity, other changes such as changes in their string decoding were
identified.

Conclusion
The SectorJ04 group’s range of targets increased sharply in 2019, and they appear to be
striving to carry out elaborated attacks while at the same time targeting indiscriminately. They
are one of the most active cyber crime groups in 2019, and they often modify and tweak their
hacking methods and perform periodic hacking activities.
The SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities are expected to continue to increase, and the
ThreatRecon team will continue to monitor the attack activity against the group.
