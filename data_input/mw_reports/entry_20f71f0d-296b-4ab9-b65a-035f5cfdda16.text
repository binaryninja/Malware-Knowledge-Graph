Introduction

Transparent Tribe (APT36, Mythic Leopard, ProjectM, Operation C-Major) is the name given
to a threat actor group largely targeting Indian entities and assets. Transparent Tribe has
also been known to target entities in Afghanistan and social activists in Pakistan, the latter of
which points towards the assumed attribution of Pakistani intelligence. Tools used by this
group include CrimsonRAT, ObliqueRAT, PeppyRAT and AndroidRAT, with most campaigns
discovered relying on spear-phishing and social-engineering of victims. Over the coming
months Team Cymru’s S2 analytic unit will be focusing on the infrastructure behind these
known toolsets.
This is the first article of a two-part series on Transparent Tribe’s CrimsonRAT infrastructure.
We have been tracking CrimsonRAT , Transparent Tribe’s most ubiquitous remote access
tool, over a number of months. This blog will present our high-level observations based on a
study of 23 CrimsonRAT command and control (C2) servers. Our intention is to provide
supporting context to existing Transparent Tribe reporting and IOCs, to aide in future threat
reconnaissance activities against this group.
Key Observations

1/8

C2s hosted with a number of different VPS providers – most commonly Contabo,
ColoCrossing, Pi Net and QuadraNet.
Port 3389 was observed open on 83% of the CrimsonRAT C2 servers.
A total of 62 distinct beacon ports were observed, with minimal evidence of port re-use
across C2s
Traffic to ip-api[.]com, used in the IP geolocation of victims, noted from C2
172.245.87.12
A review of a recent Transparent Tribe campaign reveals the targeted nature of the
group’s activities.

Summary of Findings
Please note that details of all 23 CrimsonRAT C2 servers are provided in the technical
appendix at the end of this blog.
CrimsonRAT C2 Hosting

When examining the IP attribution of CrimsonRAT C2 servers, it is apparent that
TRANSPARENT TRIBE actors have sought to spread their infrastructure across a number of
distinct providers, likely to provide some resilience to their operations. Whilst eight different
providers were observed (Figure 2), there was a degree of preference noted for Contabo (5
servers), QuadraNet (4), Pi Net (4) and ColoCrossing (3).

Figure 2:

Summary of Hosting Providers
When actors consider which hosting provider to use, many factors likely enter their decisionmaking process; accepted payment methods, geographical diversity, local privacy laws, and
the probability of law enforcement disruption, to name a few.
One caveat for these findings is that whilst specific providers have been mentioned, based
on available Whois information, in some cases the ranges used by Transparent Tribe may
have been sub-leased to other providers.
Port 3389

When reviewing open ports on the CrimsonRAT C2 server set, Port 3389, commonly
associated with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), was observed open in 83% of cases
(19 of 23). Whilst this finding may be coincidental, the observed prevalence suggests it is a
possible prerequisite for the functionality of the C2 server or it’s administration.
Transparent Tribe are known to run different versions of a .NET application which acts as the
CrimsonRAT command-and-control panel. This is a GUI application which is used to manage
components of the tool on victim hosts (see https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part1/98127/). As an interactive session is required to interface with this application, one
hypothesis is that the actors require RDP access to the CrimsonRAT command-and-control
panel.
Furthermore, the majority of CrimsonRAT servers were found to be running Windows Server
2012R2.
We are currently conducting an analysis of ongoing and historic connections to CrimsonRAT
C2s on Port 3389. The goal of this analysis is to identify any potential uses by Transparent
Tribe actors (thus identifying higher order infrastructure), as well as separating this activity
from the regular scanning of Port 3389, which takes place on the Internet every day.
Beacon Ports

3/8

A typical CrimsonRAT payload can have up to five pre-configured callback ports for
communications with the C2 server. We have witnessed minimal evidence of port re-use
across samples and the C2s we have analyzed, with only four ports being used more than
once: 3878, 4586, 6818 and 8666. It’s possible these ports are seemingly randomly selected
by the operator.
In total, 62 distinct beacon ports were identified across the 23 C2 servers, from the lower end
of 2991 to the higher end of 54131 – although the majority of ports were clustered between
2991 and 17443.
C2 172.245.87.12 (ip-api[.]com Usage)

In addition to inbound victim traffic to C2 172.245.87.12 (AS-COLOCROSSING, US), we also
observed outbound connections to ip-api[.]com (208.95.112.1) on Port 80, during the period
12 December 2020 – 06 March 2021.
This finding supports the presence of server version ‘A’ (as described in the aforementioned
Securelist blog) on this particular C2 – which is known to use ip-api[.]com for performing IP
geolocation lookups of victims when they beacon in.
Our own analysis of the CrimsonRAT server source code identifies that the ip-api[.]com
lookup occurs automatically when a new victim calls into the controller and that these results
are then cached so that further lookups are not required. These lookups can therefore be
represented as evidence of ‘new’ victims with associated timestamp information providing an
indication as to when an initial compromise has taken place. It is possible that multiple
lookups could occur for the same victim when their IP address changes due to dynamic
assignments.
Based on our coverage of C2 172.245.87.12 we see victim IPs assigned to Indian providers
beaconing to the configured ports (as described above). Therefore, using a conversion from
UTC to Indian Standard Time (IST) – UTC+05:30, we can see that victims have been newly
compromised during ‘usual’ office hours:
Time Correlation:
2020-12-12 03:39:17 UTC = 09:09:17 Local IST
2020-12-30 07:28:02 UTC = 12:58:02 Local IST
2021-02-04 07:53:52 UTC = 13:23:52 Local IST
2021-02-23 03:51:31 UTC = 09:21:31 Local IST
2021-03-04 12:10:54 UTC = 17:40:54 Local IST
2021-03-06 04:15:27 UTC = 09:45:27 Local IST
2021-03-14 09:59:47 UTC = 15:29:47 Local IST
These findings are caveated by the limitations of our coverage, i.e., these findings are
accurate based on the traffic we have observed – other compromises may have taken place
outside of these hours.

Victimology

A recent Transparent Tribe campaign, targeting the Indian Air Force (IAF), was used to
provide an example of victimology.
On 24 March 2021, a Transparent Tribe lure document (Figure 4) was disclosed on Twitter,
comprising a PowerPoint presentation for an IAF/industry collaborative event – ‘INDISEM2021’.
The objective of this event was to purportedly identify organizations in India’s commercial
sectors capable of undertaking maintenance contracts for the IAF fleet.

Figure 3:

Lure Document Positioning an Indian Air Force Conference
The venue for the event is listed as the Air Force Auditorium in Subroto Park, New Delhi.
Open-source research identifies Subroto Park as the location of numerous IAF buildings,
including the ‘Air Force School’ (Figure 4).

Force Buildings
Network traffic data for the C2 185.136.169.155 used in this campaign was reviewed and
victim IP addresses connecting to the beacon ports (6128, 8761, 11214, 15882, 17443),
were plotted on a map using geolocation information.
This process revealed two clusters of victims in close proximity to Subroto Park (Figure 5).

6/8

The victim cluster to the North centered around another area containing a number of IAF
buildings, including an Air Force Station. The Southern cluster centered around the
residential area of Sarojini Nagar. Between the two clusters sits Safdarjung Airport, a site
which houses a number of Government Administrative buildings, including the Airports
Authority of India and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The airfield itself is still
operational and is used for the transfer of high-value individuals to Indira Ghandi
International Airport when they travel out of the country – the Presidential estate is located
just to the North of the Air Force Station marked in Figure 4.
The available coverage of this particular campaign shows the likely targeting of individuals
within Indian Government or IAF locations, as well as a nearby residential area which could
feasibly house some of these individuals.
