Attack Activities by Quasar Family
Quasar

Email
Quasar [1] is an open source RAT (Remote Administration Tool) with a variety of functions.
This is easy to use and therefore exploited by several APT actors. JPCERT/CC has
confirmed that a group called APT10 used this tool in some targeted attacks against
Japanese organisations.
As Quasar’s source code is publicly available, there are many variants of this RAT seen in
the wild (referred to as “Quasar Family” hereafter). Some of them have been used in attacks
against Japanese organisations, and they are seen as a threat as well as Quasar itself.
This article introduces the details of Quasar and Quasar Family.

Quasar overview
Quasar offers many functions which are intended for purposes such as device management,
support operation and employee monitoring. Figure 1 describes Quasar’s functions and its
supported environment as specified on GitHub.

Figure 1: Quasar’s functions and supported environment
This tool was called “xRAT” at the time of its initial release, however, it was renamed as
“Quasar” in August 2015. The latest version is v1.4, released in June 2020.

Figure 2: Quasar versions
As v1.3 and the earlier are still used in recent attacks, this article explains the functions of
both v1.3 and v1.4.
Communication protocol
Quasar v1.3 uses its custom protocol which combines AES and QuickLZ. In v1.4, however,
Protocol Buffer (developed by Google) is used for data serialisation instead. In addition, the
entire communication is encrypted with TLS1.2.

Figure 3 shows the comparison of the communication format in v1.3 and v1.4.

Figure 3: Quasar’s communication format
Communication flow
In v1.3, once a client connects to a server, authentication is performed. After that, the main
body of data including the commands are exchanged. On the other hand, the authentication
is replaced by a TLS handshake in v1.4, and the data exchange begins after that.
Figure 4 illustrates Quasar’s communication flow between a client and a server.

Configuration

Quasar possesses its configuration in itself. It is encrypted by the combination of AES and
BASE64 encoding. It is decrypted with the value specified in “ENCRYPTIONKEY” in the
configuration when executed.

* “Clone” in the category refers to variants which uses the entire source code of Quasar with
some functions added or modified. “Partially copied” refers to variants created as a new RAT
using parts of the original source code.
Figure 8 shows the comparison of commands embedded in XPCTRA and Quasar.

(Left: XPCTRA / Right: Quasar)

In the comparison above, it is clear that commands in XPCTRA are mostly identical to those
in Quasar.
Figure 9 shows the comparison of the salt value in AsyncRAT and Quasar.

Figure 9: Comparison of salt value
(Above: AsyncRAT / Below: Quasar)
The salt value in AsyncRAT is identical to that in Quasar.
As Quasar Family applies some parts of the source code of Quasar, its configuration and
communication protocol are also identical. In some cases, some functions are customised,
and as a result, some new configuration and commands are added.

Attack campaigns using Quasar
Quasar has been used in many attack campaigns. Table 3 lists the differences of Quasar
used by each attack group.

The original Quasar with the default configuration value was used in most cases. Figure 10
shows an example configuration of Quasar used by APT 33.

Figure 10: Configuration of Quasar used by APT33
In most parts, the default values of the builder generating Quasar are used as is, except for
STARTUPKEY. This way, attacker groups use the default values as per the original to avoid
leaving any distinctive evidence.
In some cases, attackers customise Quasar. For example, APT 10 updated some features
and used it in some attacks. The following sections will cover the details of this custom
Quasar.
Configuration
Quasar used by APT 10 (hereafter “custom Quasar”) has the following additional values in
the configuration.
DOWNLOAD_URL
PROXY
Figure 11 shows the comparison of configuration in the custom Quasar and the original
Quasar.

8/14

Figure 11: Comparison of configuration
(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)
In “PROXY”, a proxy server URL can be configured. This ensures that the custom Quasar is
able to communicate with a C2 server even if the target’s environment uses proxy servers.
While the original Quasar uses CBC mode when encrypting configuration with AES, the
custom Quasar uses CFB mode.

Figure 12: Comparison of AES code
(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)
Added/deleted commands
There are some changes to the commands in the custom Quasar. Figure 13 shows the
comparison of commands in the custom Quasar and the original Quasar.

9/14

Figure 13: Comparison of commands
(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)
In the custom Quasar, new commands DoPlugin and DoPluginResponse are added while
some including keylogger are deleted.
With DoPlugin, new functions can be added by loading additional plugin modules. These
new modules can be deleted with DoPluginResponse.
This change enables Quasar to dynamically extend its functions with commands while
maintaining Quasar itself as simple as it can be. This suggests the attacker’s intention to
avoid detection by anti-virus software.
Error log creation
The custom Quasar has a function to create error logs. The file path of the error logs is
hardcoded in itself.

10/14

Figure 14: Error log creation
Communication protocol
The encryption algorithms for communication with a C2 server also differs in the custom
Quasar. While the original Quasar uses AES and QuickLZ, the custom Quasar also uses
XOR encoding. Figure 15 shows the XOR encoding process added to the custom Quasar.

Figure 15: XOR encoding process
For AES encryption, the custom Quasar uses CFB mode instead of CBC mode, as seen in
the configuration. The encryption methods are as follows:
Original Quasar: QuickLZ + AES (mode CBC)
Custom Quasar: QuickLZ + AES (mode CFB) + XOR

C2 server activities
JPCERT/CC investigated the activities of Quasar Family C2 servers based on the
characteristics discussed above. As of November 2020, 76 IP addresses running as C2
servers have been identified. Figure 16 shows the distribution of Quasar Family C2 servers
which were revealed in this investigation.

11/14

Figure 16: C2 server distribution
Multiple C2 servers are still running in different countries, which indicates its activeness.

In closing
Besides Quasar, other open source RATs are being used in ongoing attack cases [7].
Attackers are taking advantage of these tools to make attribution difficult and reduce the cost
for developing attack infrastructure. It is estimated that this attack trends may continue.
A tool to support Quasar analysis (compatible with Quasar v1.3 only) is available on GitHub.
We hope you find it useful.
