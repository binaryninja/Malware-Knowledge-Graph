Targeted Attacks on South Korean Organizations

Summary
Hangul (also known as Hangul Word Processor or HWP) is a proprietary word processing application published by
the South Korean company Hancom Inc.. Hangul's specialized support for the Korean written language has gained
its widespread use in South Korea, especially by the government. Malicious attackers targeting Korea are now
using Hangul files.

This report is based on AhnLab’s analysis malicious Hangul files found over 16 months, from September 2016 to
December 2017, and found the target of attack to be mainly employees of North Korea related businesses and
virtual currency related business.

The attack methods using Hangul files came in many forms: exploiting different vulnerabilities, JavaScripts,
Encapsulated PostScripts (EPS), and embedded objects. Current attacks mainly use the EPS method.

AhnLab analyzed the problem classifying the attack groups by attack target, attack method, and malware. The
attackers can be divided into three groups, and two of the three groups are actively using Hangul files as a delivery
mechanism.

In the past, the attacks using Hangul files created and executed a backdoor, which exploited a Hangul vulnerability
on the user's computer. However, attacks found after September 2016 are mainly executed in the memory of a
computer. This seems to be a technique to bypass behavior-based diagnostics of security solutions, which detect
the creation of malware in document files.

Fortunately, there is no new malware exploiting Hangul’s vulnerabilities since the second half of 2016. This means
that the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability that has already been patched so the users can prevent attacks by
simply conducting the latest Hangul security update. This, however, does not apply to the embedded object type of
malware found in Hangul files.

Targeted Attacks on South Korean Organizations

Overview
Hangul (also known as Hangul Word Processor or HWP) is a proprietary word processing application published by
the South Korean company Hancom Inc.. Hangul's specialized support for the Korean written language has gained
its widespread use in South Korea, especially by the government and schools. Thus the attackers using Hangul as
a method are those wishing to target Korean governmental institutions. AhnLab has analyzed the malicious Hangul
files found from September 2016 to December 2017 and summarized the attack targets, attack method, and the
attack groups.

Attack Methods
The most common attack method is via email. An attacker creates an email masquerading as content that
would interest the chosen target and induces the target to open the Hangul files containing malware.

Either an attacker can use the method of sending an email attachment or the attacker can alternately attempt to
deliver the malware by adding a download URL in the email.

[Figure 1] Hangul file link mail

Types of Malicious Hangul Files
Hangul file attacks use methods such as vulnerability exploitation, scripts, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), and
embedded objects, which will be discussed in details below.

Targeted Attacks on South Korean Organizations
An attacker may use other executable files, such as EXE and LNK files disguised as HWP files. However, though
widely used, it is not considered an actual Hangul file attack.

[Figure 2] LNK file disguised as a Hangul file

Vulnerabilities
An attacker arbitrarily modifies the content of a document to execute malware via an abnormal behavior. Attack
methods exploiting this vulnerability are not easy to detect. Moreover, the compatibility of the files are greatly affected
by the Hangul software version so sometimes the document takes a while to open or the document may not even
be able to be opened at all. Fortunately, no new vulnerabilities have been found in Hangul since the fall of 2016.

JavaScript
Hancom Office supports JavaScript and many malware are written in JavaScript. Normally, documents containing
scripts ask for user confirmation before running the script. However, a vulnerability in which a script starts without
user notification was found in a 2007 version of Hangul.

[Figure 3] Malicious Hangul files containing JavaScript

The file contains data corresponding to a Windows executable file in JavaScript and uses it to create Windows
executable files.

Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a script that processes Adobe images. After the vulnerability exploiting EPS
(CVE-2015-2545) was found in 2015, the first malicious Hangul files written in EPS appeared in September 2016
and were found continuously until January 2018.

[Figure 5] Examples of attacks using EPS scripts

Currently malicious scripts written in EPS cannot run in Hangul with the latest security update. However, attacks
using this vulnerability will continue until a new vulnerability is found. Therefore, users must apply the latest security
updates to avoid damage from EPS scripted attacks.

Embedded Objects
Object embedding itself is not a vulnerability but it is a way to attach executable codes in a document and then
induce a user to click and execute it.

It can be used by attackers to disguise malware in the form of an annex within the document.

There is also a type of document that uses an image of a notification window as seem in Figure 6. When the user
clicks the "OK" button to close the window, the inserted malware is executes.

[Figure 6] Malicious Hangul document disguised as a notification window

Among the embedded objects, the executable file asks the user whether to run it. You can see the path where the
file is saved through the notification window as in Figure 7.

Status of malicious Hangul document files
A total of 135 malicious Hangul document files were collected over 16 months from September 2016 to December
2017 by AhnLab. The monthly statistics for this data is as shown in [Table 1].

Targeted Attacks on South Korean Organizations

[Table 1] Number of malicious Hangul document files detected by month

The percentages of attacks by their various types were 75% EPS, 14% vulnerability exploitation, 7% object
embedding, and scripts came in at 4%. EPS was the most used method.

[Figure 8] Ratio of attack methods using malicious Hangul files

And the collected information by category were 18% on general information (on products, security, announcements,
and speech) ,17% on North Korea, 17% on virtual money, 14% on finance, and 8% on resumes.

[Figure 9] Ratio of content of malicious Hangul files

It seems like the attacker is targeting individuals working on things related to North Korea (North Korean defectors,
North Korean human rights activists, North Korean researchers, journalists, etc.).

AhnLab analyzed the content of malicious Hangul document files, attack techniques, and malware source codes to
find the following information. First, the attackers can be divided into three groups (A, B, and C) where Group A
(26%) and Group B (48%) were responsible for 74% of the attacks, comprising most of the attacks. Other than the
three groups, 25% of the attacks are unclassified, meaning that there could be more attack groups revealed upon
later analysis.

Change in Malware Source Codes
The malware that exploits Hangul document files are generally 'downloaders' that download other malware and
'backdoors' that allow remote control.

The most common form is the downloader. The downloader downloads malware from a specific address. If files
can be downloaded from a specific address, it is even possible to replace the old malware with new malware. It can
also include a backdoor that can remotely manipulate the contents of an infected computer.

In the past, it was common to create and run a backdoor on a user's computer using a vulnerability in Hangul.
However, most malware found since September 2016 runs only in the computer’s memory. This seems to be a
technique to bypass behavior-based diagnostics of security solutions which detect the pattern of malware in
document files.

We have also found cases where files were created, but only executed when Hangul was running.

Attack groups
In 2017, there were at least three groups using Hangul files for attacks -note that classification of attack groups can
be divided or merged depending on the development of any new leads. Among them, the attack targets of the two
groups that actively used Hangul files for attack were clear.

Group A - Red Eyes
Group A is also known as Red Eyes, Group 123, ScarCurf, APT37, Reaper, and Ricochet Chollima. From the
analysis results, it was deemed that the main target of this group are individuals working in the fields related to North
Korea, such as North Korean defectors, North Korean human rights activists, North Korean researchers, and
journalists. In addition, documents related to the military were included in attack cases.

The names of the malicious Hangul file used in this attack group are as follows:

[Table 2] Malicious Hangul document file names used in attacks by Group A

This group created malware using the first EPS in September 2016.

The Hangul document, disguised as a North Korean New Year Address for January 2017, is in the form of an
embedded object. Information about malware creators can be gained using the document. For example, looking at
the file path ‘C:\Users\pad-2\AppData\Local\Temp\Hwp (3).exe’ for object insertion, we can find that the name of the
malware
creator
is
pad-2.
In
particular,
looking
at
the
strings
such
as
‘\\192.168.100.22\saggazi\Happy\Work\2016.8~2016.8.10~’, we can find the Korean word 'saggazi,' indicating that
the creator may be Korean or someone familiar with Korean. We are tracking malware produced by the same group
through related strings.

[Figure 14] Malware maker information contained in a malicious Hangul document file

In late October 2017, the same group used Microsoft Word's Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) document file for an
attack.

In April 2017, this attack group released a Hangul file with a malware to destroy hard disks. When the malware is
executed, it destroys the content of the hard disk, reboots, and displays only a message that reads 'Are you Happy?'.

Malware of this attack group contains a character string that is a typical program database (PDB) file format. Through this PDBrelated string, we can guess the attacker's malware version and malware type.

[Figure 16] PDB contents by version

This attack group was known for an attack using a zero-day flash file at the end of January 2018. They are a
new group in the center of attention since a report was published on the group in February 2018.

Group B
Group B is believed to be the group associated with the 2014 Sony Pictures hacking. Since 2014, this group has
attacked defense industries and large corporations in Korea, and is focused on attacking virtual money exchanges
and virtual currency-related laboratories in 2017. It impersonated a financial committee as well as an attorney
general, etc., and disguised important files as the preparatory documents of a tax investigation, transactions of
suspected corporate body, and other content relevant to an investigation.

[Table 3] Malicious document file names used in the attacks of Group B

This group mainly used EPS, but the scripting method is quite different compared to Group A.

[Figure 17] Malicious EPS used by Group B

Group C
In Group C, only the Hangul file in an object embedded type was found in June of 2017. However, analysis of the
embedded executable file shows that there are more than 40 variants and that they have been active since July
2015.

Malware is embedded as an object in the Hangul document file, and when the user clicks it, the downloader runs
and downloads additional malware from http://endlesspaws.com/sitemap.tar.gz. At the same time, it downloads the

normal Hangul file from http://endlesspaws.com/dump.sql and displays the contents of the "annex.hwp" file so that
the user does not know about the malware infection.

[Figure 17] is the downloaded 'annex.hwp', which contains the content from a North Korean human rights civilian
organization activity support project.

Also, the object embedded Hangul file shows that the user name of the malware maker is 'easy.’

[Figure 18] Information of the maker in a malicious Hangul document file

After the analysis of the downloader variants, the name of the Hangul file to download is shown in [Table 4].

[Table 4] Names of download files used for attack by Group C

Approximately 25 backdoor variants downloaded by the downloader have been identified and were first found
in July 2015. The file names of the backdoors are shown in [Table 5].

[Table 5] Names of backdoor file used for attack by Group C

Group C uses Mutex as a downloader and a backdoor as shown in [Table 6].

[Table 6] Mutex used in malware in Group C attacks

The target of the attack is identified as a North Korean human rights group for now. However, we cannot identify
specific attack targets as we could not check other Hangul files. Group C seems to be different from Group A
so far, but if the main target of this group is North Korea related workers, association with Group A cannot be
excluded.

Other
In November 2017, a Hangul file contained Ursnif, a financial information hijacking malware, was also found.

For documents containing Ursnif variants, the username was the name of a famous Korean company, and the path
to the object was C:\Users\User Name\Desktop\DuranDuran\Sample\patch39.exe.

Response and Prevention
AhnLab’s world recognized anti-malware solution V3 diagnoses Hangul malware. The aliases identified by
AhnLab V3 are as below:
EPS/Cve-2015-2545 (2016.11.30.00)
EPS/Dropper.Gen (2017.06.15.00)
EPS/Exploit (2017.11.23.00)
HWP/Cve-2015-2545 (2016.01.07.00)
HWP/Dropper (2017.01.04.00)
HWP/Exploit (2015.08.01.00)
HWP/Exploit-PT.Gen (2010.09.29.00)
HWP/Malinker (2017.06.10.00)
In the viewpoint of attackers targeting Korean users, Hangul files are truly appealing. Therefore, users should apply
the latest update in order to avoid damages. In addition, when opening a Hangul document, users should be careful
about the executable files that are embedded inside, such as links, images, movies, and documents. Attackers have
been exploiting various methods of attack over the past decade. Fortunately, there is no new vulnerability to exploit
and use to attack by modifying a Hangul document file. However, attacks aiming domestic users such as Hangul
attacks will steadily continue.
