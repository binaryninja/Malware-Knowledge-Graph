Malware Targeting Windows 8 Uses Google Docs

Initially, I thought that Backdoor.Makadocs was a simple and typical back door Trojan
horse. It receives and executes commands from a command-and-control (C&C) server
and it gathers information from the compromised computer including the host name and
the operating system type. Interestingly, the malware author has also considered the
possibility that the compromised computer could be running Windows 8 or Windows
Server 2012.

Windows 8 was released in October of this year. This is not necessarily a surprise for
security researchers as we always encounter new malware when new products are
released. However, this malware does not use any particular function unique to Windows 8
and we know that this malware existed before the launch of Windows 8. Based on these
facts, we believe this code must be an update to the malware.
Next, I would like to introduce a very unique feature of Backdoor.Makadocs. The latest
version of Makadocs does not connect to a C&C server directly, rather, it uses Google
docs as a proxy server.

Google docs has a function called viewer that retrieves the resources of another URL and
displays it. Basically, this functionality allows a user to view a variety of file types in the
browser. In violation of Google's policies, Backdoor.Makadocs uses this function to access
its C&C server. It is possible that the malware author has implemented this functionality in
an attempt to prevent the direct connection to the C&C from being discovered. The
connection to the Google docs server is encrypted using HTTPS, thereby making it difficult
to be blocked locally. It is possible for Google to prevent this connection by using a firewall.
We confirmed that Backdoor.Makadocs arrives as a Rich Text Format (RTF) or Microsoft
Word document.

Presently, this document does not utilize any vulnerability in order to drop its component,
instead, it relies on social engineering tactics. It attempts to pique the userâ€™s interest with
the title and content of the document and trick them into clicking on it and executing it. The
following code extract leads us to believe that the malware primarily targets people living in
Brazil.

Symantec products detect the RTF and Microsoft-Word files as Trojan.Dropper. To stay
safe, please ensure that you have the latest patches installed on your computer and keep
your antivirus definitions up-to-date.
