Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for June: MUSTANG
PANDA
June 15, 2018
Adam Meyers Research & Threat Intel

The June 2018 adversary spotlight is on MUSTANG PANDA, a China-based adversary
that has demonstrated an ability to rapidly assimilate new tools and tactics into its
operations, as evidenced by its use of exploit code for CVE-2017-0199 within days of its
public disclosure.
In April 2017, CrowdStrike® Falcon Intelligence™ observed a previously unattributed actor
group with a Chinese nexus targeting a U.S.-based think tank. Further analysis revealed a
wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary
targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian
language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering
intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like
Poison Ivy or PlugX.

Recently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from MUSTANG PANDA, using a
unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed
activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate
tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, MUSTANG PANDA actors reused
previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.

Mustang Panda’s Methods
Mustang Panda’s unique infection chain often takes the following steps:
1. The infection chain used in this attack begins with a weaponized link to a
Google Drive folder, obfuscated using the goo.gl link shortening service.
2. When contacted, the Google Drive link retrieves a zip file, which contains a .lnk
file obfuscated as a .pdf file using the double extension trick.
3. This file requires the target to attempt to open the .lnk file, which redirects the
user to a Windows Scripting Component (.wsc) file, hosted on an adversarycontrolled microblogging page. MUSTANG PANDA has previously used the observed
microblogging site to host malicious PowerShell scripts and Microsoft Office
documents in targeted attacks on Mongolia-focused NGOs.
4. The .lnk file uses an embedded VBScript component to retrieve a decoy PDF file
and a PowerShell script from the adversary-controlled web page.
5. The PowerShell script creates a Cobalt Strike stager payload. This PowerShell
script also retrieves an XOR-encoded Cobalt Strike beacon payload from an
adversary-controlled domain.
6. The Cobalt Strike Beacon implant beacons to the command-and-control (C2) IP
address, which is used to remotely control the implant.
There are no known community or industry names associated with this actor.
