Reader Vinnie shared his analysis of KPOT malware with us:
In a previous write up, I documented a PowerShell downloader (shown below) pushing KPOT malware. Since then,
all of the files have been submitted to VirusTotal allowing for further analysis. This has also been recently
documented by ISC Handler Didier Stevens (ISC Links below).
PowerShell Downloader:

URLs from PowerShell Downloader:
hxxp://show1[.]website/OerAS.dat (Obfuscated AutoIt script, Base64 encoded as a certificate)
hxxp://show1[.]website/HeyaL.dat (AutoIt Interpreter) – Legitimate
hxxp://show1[.]website/iPYOy.dat (Encrypted KPOT Malware)
Excerpt from Base64 decoded AutoIt script(‘i8ek7’) showing obfuscation:

Decode function at the bottom of AutoIt script:

1/4

The string is split from ‘*’ and then each encoded character is subtracted from the number after the
comma($integer) before being converted from Unicode.
Decoded sample:

All files necessary in the same folder ‘Temp’ – Windows 7 Virtual Machine:

Utilizing PowerShell to initiate infection chain:

Process chain showing ‘dllhost.exe’ process hollowing:
CreateProcess: powershell.exe:2428 > "%UserProfile%\Downloads\Temp\r17mi.com i8ek7 "
- [Child PID: 2452]
CreateProcess: r17mi.com:2452 > "%UserProfile%\Downloads\Temp\r17mi.com i8ek7 "
- [Child PID: 2064]
CreateProcess: r17mi.com:2064 > "%WinDir%\SysWOW64\dllhost.exe"
- [Child PID: 2244]
CreateProcess: dllhost.exe:2244 > "%WinDir%\system32\cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 && del
%WinDir%\SysWOW64\dllhost.exe"
- [Child PID: 536]
CreateProcess: cmd.exe:536 > "ping 127.0.0.1 "

“dllhost.exe” process dump via Task Manager:

The decrypted KPOT malware has the SHA256 Hash
“3fd4aa339bdfee23684ff495d884aa842165e61af85fd09411abfd64b9780146” and VT score of 34/71.
