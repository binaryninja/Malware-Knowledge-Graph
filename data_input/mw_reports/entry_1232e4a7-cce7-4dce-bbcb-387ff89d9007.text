The dark web servers for the REvil ransomware operation have suddenly turned back on
after an almost two-month absence. It is unclear if this marks their ransomware gang's
return or the servers being turned on by law enforcement.
On July 2nd, the REvil ransomware gang, aka Sodinokibi, used a zero-day vulnerability in
the Kaseya VSA remote management software to encrypt approximately 60 managed
service providers (MSPs) and over 1,500 of their business customers.
REvil then demanded $5 million from MSPs for a decryptor or $44,999 for each encrypted
extension at the individual businesses.
The gang also demanded $70 million for a master decryption key to decrypt all Kaseya
victims but soon dropped the price to $50 million.

After the attack, the ransomware gang faced increasing pressure from law enforcement and
the White House, who warned that the USA would take action themselves if Russia did not
act upon threat actors in their borders.
Soon after, the REvil ransomware gang disappeared, and all of their Tor servers and
infrastructure were shut down.
To this day, it is not clear what happened, but it left ransomware victims who wished to
negotiate unable to do so and without the ability to restore files.
Mysteriously, Kaseya later received the master decryption key for the attack victims and
stated it was from a trusted third party. It is believed that Russian intelligence received the
decryption key from the threat actors and passed it along to the FBI as a gesture of
goodwill.

REvil infrastructure suddenly turns back on
Today, both the Tor payment/negotiation site and REvil's Tor 'Happy Blog' data leak site
suddenly came back online.
The most current victim on the REvil data leak site was added on July 8th, 2021, just five
days before REvil's mysterious disappearance.

REvil's Happy Blog data leak site
Unlike the data leak site, which is functional, the Tor negotiation site does not appear to be
fully operational yet. While it shows the login screen, as seen below, it does not allow
victims to log into the site.

REvil Tor negotiation site
The gang's http://decoder.re/ is still offline at this time.
It is unclear at this time whether the ransomware gang is back in operation, the servers
have been turned back on by mistake, or it is due to the actions of law enforcement.

Willing to bet they just took a little vacation. Not like they can't afford to be away for a
while.

Did anybody actually acquire the universal decryptor? I've got a client's drive that still
needs to be decrypted.

Lawrence Abrams - 8 months ago

There was no universal decryptor, other than for the kaseya attack.

rpcribari - 8 months ago

I'm looking for the Kaseya attack decryptor. I can't find an actual download for it.
