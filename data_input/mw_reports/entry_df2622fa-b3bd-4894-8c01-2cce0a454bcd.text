process using some of the examples we encountered.

Sodinokibi was first detected in April 2019 and linked to the retired GandCrab. From that point
on, Sodinokibi launched several high-profile attacks that continued throughout
2020, thus making a name for itself as one of the ransomware families that should be
watched out for. Here we describe Sodinokibi’s typical attack process.
Technical analysis
The threat actors behind Sodinokibi typically hire a variety of affiliates for their initial
access. Their attacks often begin with familiar techniques like malspam emails with spearphishing links or attachments, RDP access that uses valid accounts, compromised websites,
and exploits. They also use techniques that indicate their targeted approach.
Initial access

1/3

We observed the use of several of these initial access techniques. For example, as with
campaigns, we saw the use of the CVE-2019-2725 vulnerability and observed an instance
where Sodinokibi was loaded in the memory of PowerShell through reflective-load instead
of binary execution. We also saw malspam that led to the use of a macro to download and
execute the malware.
CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2019-11510 are also used by the malware, as well as
compromised valid accounts. This allows the threat actors to drop and execute other
components like the anti-antivirus, exfiltration tools, and finally Sodinokibi itself.
Lateral movement and evasion tactics
Sodinokibi, like many ransomware families known today, have a targeted approach with
regard to their campaigns. In line with this, we observed the use of RDP and PsExec for
lateral movement — a sign of targeted attacks — to drop and execute other components and
the ransomware itself.
We also observed that PC Hunter and Process Hacker are used to terminate services or
processes, especially those services and processes that are related to antivirus software.
Once the system is infected, Sodinokibi sends a report and system information to
its command-and-control (C&C) server. It generates a pseudorandom URL based on a fixed
format and generation to add to a list of domains in its configuration.
Security recommendations
Sodinokibi has been known to target high-profile entities and uses notable evasive tactics.
Organizations should, therefore, be wary of its techniques. For now, here are some best
practices to prevent similar ransomware attacks:
Avoid opening unverified emails or clicking on their embedded links, as these can start
the ransomware installation process.
Back up your important files using the 3-2-1 rule: Create three backup copies on two
different file formats, with one of the backups in a separate location.
Regularly update software, programs, and applications, to ensure that your apps are
current, with the latest protections from new vulnerabilities.
