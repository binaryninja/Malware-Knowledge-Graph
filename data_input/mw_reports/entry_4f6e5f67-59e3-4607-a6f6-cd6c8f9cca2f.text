Transparent Tribe begins targeting education sector in
latest campaign
blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/07/transparent-tribe-targets-education.html

Cisco Talos has been tracking a new malicious campaign operated by the Transparent
Tribe APT group.
This campaign involves the targeting of educational institutions and students in the
Indian subcontinent, a deviation from the adversary's typical focus on government
entities.
The attacks result in the deployment of CrimsonRAT, Transparent Tribe's malware of
choice for establishing long-term access into victim networks.
We assess with high confidence that a Pakistani web hosting services provider "Zain
Hosting" was used for deploying and operating components of Transparent Tribe's
infrastructure. This is likely one of many third parties Transparent Tribe employs to
prepare, stage and/or deploy components of their operation.

Overview
Cisco Talos recently discovered an ongoing campaign conducted by the Transparent Tribe
APT group against students at various educational institutions in India. This campaign was
partially covered by another security firm, but our findings reveal more details regarding the
adversary's operations.

1/12

Typically, this APT group focuses on targeting government (government employees, military
personnel) and pseudo-government entities (think tanks, conferences, etc.) using remote
access trojans (RATs) such as CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT. However, in this new campaign
dating back to December 2021, the adversary is targeting students of universities and
colleges in India. This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its
network of victims to include civilian users.
We also assess with high confidence that a Pakistani web hosting services provider,
"ZainHosting" was employed by the APT for deploying and operating parts of Transparent
Tribe's infrastructure used in this campaign.

Threat actor profile
Transparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-linked threat actor. This group typically targets
individuals and entities associated with governments and military personnel in the Indian
subcontinent, specifically Afghanistan and India. Transparent Tribe has also been known to
use their CrimsonRAT implant against human rights activists in Pakistan.
The group primarily uses three Windows-based malware families to carry out espionage
activities against their targets.
CrimsonRAT is a .NET-based implant that is the group's malware of choice since at
least 2020. Transparent Tribe's multiple campaigns leveraging CrimsonRAT over the
years indicate a steady evolution in the implant's capabilities.
ObliqueRAT is a C/C++-based implant discovered by Talos in early 2020. ObliqueRAT
is primarily reserved for hyper-targeted attacks on government personnel and in
operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This implant
has also seen a constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious functionalities
over time.
Custom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable
downloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as opposed
to CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.
Transparent Tribe also maintains a suite of mobile implants in their arsenal. Implants such as
CapraRAT are constantly modified to be deployed against targets. These implants contain a
plethora of malicious capabilities meant to steal data from mobile devices.

Attack details: Infection chain
The attack consists of a maldoc delivered to the target as an attachment or a link to a remote
location via a spear-phishing email. The maldocs consist of malicious VBA macros

commonly observed in previous Transparent Tribe campaigns. The macros extract an
embedded archive file from the maldoc and unzip it to execute a copy of the malware in the
archive file. The malware in the archive files is CrimsonRAT.

CrimsonRAT
The CrimsonRAT payloads deployed in this campaign are very similar to those from past
Transparent Tribe campaigns. It is the staple implant of choice for Transparent Tribe to
establish long-term access into victim networks. This RAT is actively updated, adding new
capabilities and obfuscating the implant.
The latest version of CrimsonRAT seen in this campaign contains a number of capabilities,
including:
List files and folders in a directory path specified by the command and control (C2).
Run specific processes on the endpoint, such as keylogger and USB modules.
List process IDs and names running on the endpoint.
Get information, such as name, creation times and size of image files (pictures such as
BMP, JPG, etc.) specified by the C2.
Take screenshots of the current screen and send them to the C2.
Upload keylogger logs from a file on disk to the C2.
Send system information to the C2, including:
Computer name, username, operating system name, the file path of implant and
parent folder path.
Indicator of whether the keylogger module is in the endpoint and running and its
version.
Indicator of whether the USB module is in the endpoint and running and its
version.
Run arbitrary commands on the system.
Write data sent by the C2 to a file on disk.
Read contents of a file on disk and exfiltrate to the C2.
List all drives on the system.
List all files in a directory.
Download the USB worm and keylogger modules from the C2 and write them to disk.
Send a file's name, creation time and size to the C2- file path as specified by the C2.
Delete files specified by the C2 from the endpoint.
Get names, creation times and size of all files containing the file extension specified by
the C2.

Infrastructure and attribution

4/12

Campaign Infrastructure
A number of these maldocs and archives containing these maldocs were hosted on the
domains registered by the attackers, with the earliest domain registered in June 2021. These
domains were named so that they would appear relevant to students and educational entities
in India. Some examples of domains registered by the threat actor are:
studentsportal[.]live
studentsportal[.]website
studentsportal[.]co
However, we've also discovered the use of additional media-themed domains that the
attackers are preparing to use in parallel campaigns against their targets. These domains are
in line with Transparent Tribe's tactic of using malicious file-sharing domains we've observed
in previous attacks and campaigns.
cloud-drive[.]store
user-onedrive[.]live
drive-phone[.]online
During the course of our research, we discovered SSL certificate overlaps with another
domain registered by the attackers in June 2021, geo-news[.]tv, using the email address
immikhan034[@]gmail[.]com. This domain is a typo-squatted version of geo[.]tv, a legitimate
Pakistani news website. Subdomains on the malicious typo-squatted domains include those
that hosted SSL certificates for the student and media-themed malicious domains:
cloud-drive.geo-news.tv
drive-phone.geo-news.tv
studentsportal.geo-news.tv
user-onedrive.geo-news.tv
All the malicious domains have recently resolved to the same IP address:
198[.]37[.]123[.]126. This strongly suggests shared infrastructure among all the malicious
domains.

Honeytraps
Many of the domains registered by the attackers for this campaign consisted of rudimentary
websites with front pages containing embedded Google Drive folders. All of these folders
contained pictures of women. It is highly likely that these front pages will be used as stagers
for honeytrap-based attacks in the future, another tactic typical of the Transparent Tribe APT.

Infrastructure attribution
The DNS SOA records for all the malicious domains utilized in this APT campaign contain a
common administrator email address: rupees001[at]gmail[.]com. This email address has
been used to register and administer approximately 2,000 legitimate and malicious domains.
However, there are a couple of domains in this list that stand out:
zainhosting[.]net
vebhost[.]com
Of the two domains, vebhost[.]com hosts a dummy website that advertises website-building
services. The malicious domains used in this campaign, such as studentsportal[.]live and
others, use vebhost[.]com name servers, specifically:
ns1[.]vebhost[.]com

7/12

ns2[.]vebhost[.]com
Therefore, it is highly likely that the operators registering and maintaining the malicious
domains also operate web-hosting services through vebhost[.]com.
The second domain, zainhosting[.]net belongs to a seemingly legitimate web services and
hosting provider called "Zain Hosting" based out of Lahore, Pakistan.
Apart from zainhosting[.]net, the hosting provider also operates zainhosting[.]com, which is
this business' primary front for their legitimate operations. Interestingly, vebhost[.]com uses
zainhosting[.]com's name servers:
ns5.zainhosting.com
ns6.zainhosting.com
ZainHosting advertises their services heavily on Facebook and has been active since at least
2010. Their webpage from 2010 listed rupees001[at]gmail[.]com as a contact address for the
business. This email has since been used to register, renew and administer several
malicious web pages over time, including the malicious domains used by the Transparent
Tribe APT in their most recent campaign.

8/12

ZainHosting webpage from 2010 listing rupees001[at]gmail[.]com as a contact address.
All three sets of domains -- the malicious Transparent Tribe infrastructure, vebhost[.]com and
zainhosting[.]net/com -- are clearly related, with "ZainHosting"' owning and operating the
malicious infrastructure. However, the entire scope of ZainHosting's role in the Transparent
Tribe organization is still unknown. We believe with high confidence that ZainHosting is just
one of the many infrastructure contractors hired by Transparent Tribe. Such contractors
might be hired to simply prepare and stage the APT's infrastructure and possibly be given
packages (archives, etc.) containing malicious artifacts to deploy, that are then distributed by
the APT operators themselves to targets of interest.

Conclusion
Transparent Tribe has been aggressively trying to widen its net of victims in the Indian
subcontinent. Their operations started as early as at least 2016 and have largely focussed
on infecting government and military officials in Afghanistan and India. Over the past few
years, we saw the APT begin targeting pseudo-government entities and individuals
belonging to think tanks and defense contractors.
However, their new campaign indicates that the threat actors' strategy is evolving to target
civilian personnel, specifically those connected to educational institutions. This might be in
accordance with their nation-state's goal to establish long-term access and steal valuable
and restricted research from premier research institutions associated with the Indian
government. Keeping tabs on an adversary nation's research endeavors is a strategic goal
adopted by many APT groups observed across the world.
Organizations must be diligent against such highly motivated adversaries that are rapidly
evolving their strategies and expanding their network of targets. In-depth defense strategies
based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention. However,
this should always be complemented by a good incident response plan which has been not
only tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test
on real engagements.
