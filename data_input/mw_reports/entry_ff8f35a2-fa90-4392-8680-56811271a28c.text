Not So Lazarus: Mapping DPRK Cyber Threat Groups to
Government Organizations
mandiant.com/resources/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government

Mandiant believes that North Korea's cyber capability supports both long-standing and
immediate political and national security priorities, as well as financial goals. We assess most
of North Korea's cyber operations, including espionage, destructive operations, and financial
crimes, are primarily conducted by elements within the Reconnaissance General Bureau.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of State Security and United Front Department’s missions appear to
play limited roles in North Korea's cyber program. Open-source reporting often uses the
Lazarus Group title as an umbrella term referring to numerous North Korean cyber operators,
however, understanding the different institutions within this secretive hermit nation and how
they continue to evolve and share resources aids organizations in proactively defending from
these types of threats. Mandiant judges North Korea's intelligence apparatus possesses the
flexibility and resilience to create cyber units based on the needs of the country. Additionally
overlaps in infrastructure, malware, and tactics, techniques and procedures indicate there
are shared resources amongst their cyber operations.

patterns, malware usage, and defector reporting that shines some light onto a seeming
change taking place within the North Korean cyber ranks.

United Front Department
UFD is an organization sponsored by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.
Although it is comprised of operating groups that may not correspond to well-known “cyber
actors”, the organization's overall effort centers around disseminating pro-regime
propaganda targeting South Korea, likely to undermine their primary geopolitical rival. The

UFD typically leverages online information operations, including an "army of cyber trolls," to
promote pro-DPRK political narratives on web forums as well as conventional propaganda
efforts, such as leaflets and radio broadcasts targeting their southern neighbor.
In a two-year span, these “cyber trolls” allegedly hijacked South Korean users accounts
online and posted an estimated 68k propaganda items in web forums and various comment
sections in an attempt to amplify the regimes’ message in South Korea. This organization’s
end goal is the establishment of pro-North Korean groups within South Korea

Ministry of State Security
The MSS is the DRPK's primary counterintelligence service which operates as an
autonomous part of the government and is primarily tasked with domestic counterespionage
and overseas counterintelligence activities. APT37's previous campaigns targeting foreign
joint venture partners as well as threat activity against defectors, defector support agencies,
and humanitarian organizations indicate APT37's activities most likely align with the agenda
of MSS.
APT37's assessed primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of
DPRK's strategic military, political, and economic interests. A lack of recent, significant
activity from this actor matched with an uptick in similar targeting from units within the
“Kimsuky” actor-set may indicate a shift or consolidation within North Korea’s cyber
leadership.

Reconnaissance General Bureau: An Overview
The RGB is the North Korea's primary foreign intelligence service, responsible
for intelligence collection and clandestine operations. It is believed to be comprised of six
bureaus:
1st Bureau: Operations
2nd Bureau: Reconnaissance
3rd Bureau: Foreign Intelligence
5th Bureau: Inter-Korean Affairs
6th Bureau: Technology
7th Bureau: Support
Notably, a 4th bureau does not exist likely because the number "4" is considered taboo.
While cyber efforts are a portion of the organization's overall operations, the 3rd Bureau
(Foreign Intelligence) and 5th Bureau (Inter-Korean Affairs) appear to hold the “meat and
potatoes” of North Korea's cyber program.

Reconnaissance General Bureau: 3rd Bureau

Lab 110…the focal point for the Lazarus Group Umbrella
TEMP.Hermit, APT38, and Andariel are likely subordinate to Lab 110. Lab 110 is likely an
expanded and reorganized version of "Bureau 121," often noted as North Korea's primary
hacking unit. Lab 110 contains some elements that are most closely aligned with the
organization, publicly reported as "Lazarus Group." Open-source reporting often uses the
Lazarus Group title as an umbrella term, referring to numerous clusters that we track
separately. Although TEMP.Hermit is most frequently aligned with Lazarus Group reporting,
often times, researchers and open sources lump all three of these actor sets – and
sometimes even all of the North Korean APTs – merely as “Lazarus Group”.
TEMP.Hermit is an actor that has been around since at least 2013. Their operations
since that time are representative of Pyongyang's efforts to collect strategic intelligence
to benefit North Korean interests. This actor targets government, defense,
telecommunications, and financial institutions worldwide and the term “Lazarus Group”
refers most often to this cluster of activities.
APT38 is a financially motivated group sponsored by North Korea, known for significant
financial compromises and its use of destructive malware against financial institutions.
The group has been attributed to sophisticated compromises targeting Interbank Fund
Transfer Systems to steal millions of dollars at a time across multiple countries
worldwide.
Andariel focuses its operations on foreign businesses, government agencies, financial
services infrastructure, private corporations, and businesses, as well as the defense
industry. The group also conducts cyber crime likely as an extra source of income to
the government as we observed in signature malware activity by this actor; however,
targeting of military and government personnel appear to be the primary focus.

Bureau 325 was publicly announced in January 2021, when the structure of the RGB
likely shifted in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The new unit
appeared to take on primarily conducting intelligence gathering operations against
COVID-19 research and manufacturing organizations. Defector reporting also stated
that in January 2021, the unit was not fully operational. Overtime, we have observed
sharing of efforts and "non-COVID-19" type of activities, indicating this actor may be
nearing the milestone that defector reporting states, “...the group will soon begin ‘fullscale’ operations”. This newly formed Bureau 325 houses the DPRK COVID-19focused unit and corresponds to activities tracked in the open source as “CERIUM”. We
suspect that individuals from several previously tracked clusters – including
TEMP.Hermit, and Kimsuky – were also drafted to Bureau 325 to respond to highpriority operations from DPRK leadership.
Over time, we began to see this organization shift from “strictly COVID-19” efforts
to the targeting of defectors, defense and governments, bloggers, media,
cryptocurrency services, and financial institutions. This increase in
responsibilities indicates the group has quickly gained the confidence of DPRK’s
senior leadership and likely gained prominence. Defenders will continue to see
Bureau 325's fingerprints on more campaigns in the wild.

Reconnaissance General Bureau: 5th Bureau
There are overlaps that indicate cyber elements of the UFD share interests regarding issues
on the Korean peninsula and share targeting overlaps with APT37; however, these extra
elements appear to be supplemental to the 5th Bureau’s overall mandate.
Kimsuky is an actor often conflated in OSINT that conducts targeted campaigns to
collect strategic intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the
DPRK's interests. The actor primarily targets organizations in the U.S. and South
Korea, including individuals working within the government, military, manufacturing,
academic, and think tank organizations that possess subject matter expertise in
defense and security, particularly nuclear security and nonproliferation policy. This
threat actor’s activities include collecting financial, personal, and client data specifically
from academic, manufacturing, and national security industries in South Korea. The
most likely reason is for the purpose of setting up further infrastructure for cyber
espionage operations, leveraging personas for phishing campaigns, or carrying out
identity theft and fraud.

Conclusion
The country's espionage operations are believed to be reflective of the regime's immediate
concerns and priorities, which is likely currently focused on acquiring financial resources
through crypto heists, targeting of media, news, and political entities, information on foreign
relations and nuclear information, and a slight decline in the once spiked stealing of COVID5/6

19 vaccine research. Information collected in these campaigns will possibly be used to
develop or produce internal items and strategies, as in vaccines, mitigations to bypass
sanctions, funding for the country’s weapons programs, and so on. Additional information
continues to be collected to determine the extent to which these groups operate and
streamline their operations. Being able to see though the intentional fog left by North Korean
leadership, and able to identify targeting patterns that align to physical units allows for a
proactive defense against these cyber operators. This effort is critical in a country where little
is known to the outside world and defector reporting supplemented with cyber operations can
help.
