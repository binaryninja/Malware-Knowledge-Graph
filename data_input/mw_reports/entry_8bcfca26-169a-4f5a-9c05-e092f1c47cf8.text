The internal networks of Lithuania's National Center for Public Health (NVSC) and several
municipalities have been infected with Emotet malware following a large campaign targeting
the country's state institutions.
"When infected recipients opened infected messages, the virus entered the internal networks
of the institutions," NVSC officials said in a statement published today.
"Infected computers, after downloading additional files, began sending fake emails or
engaging in other types of malicious activity."
Lithuanian government officials, ministry representatives, and epidemiological diagnostics
experts that have previously been contacted by NVSC specialists via email have all received
Emotet-infected emails from infected systems.

The NVSC e-mail systems have been temporarily shut down on Tuesday to stop the further
spread of the virus.
NVSC information technology specialists, together with experts from the Central State
Telecommunications Center and the National Cyber Security Center currently working on
cleaning affected systems of the Emotet infection, as well as on recovering NVSC e-mails
and restoring email access.

Emails sent as replies to previous conversations
Rytis Rainys, Director of the Lithuanian National Cyber Security Center (NKSC), warned that
the Emotet emails sent as replies to previous conversations distributed malicious code using
password-protected archives as attachments, with the password shared in the email body.
This prevented anti-malware solutions from detecting the malicious emails which made it
possible for the targeted individuals to open the attachment and infect themselves.
Stealing reply-chain emails is a known Emotet tactic used to camouflage malicious emails as
parts of existing conversations for higher credibility and better infection rates in future spam
campaigns.
The tactic is also being used by the Qbot trojan, and it was previously by the Gozi ISFB
banking trojan and the URSNIF information-stealing trojan.
This is the second large Emotet campaign that has targeted Lithuania this year, with a
previous one detected by the NKSC in October.
The NKSC published an advisory at the time recommending potential targets (including but
not limited to state institutions and companies) to enable and properly configure Sender
Policy Framework (SPF) email authentication.

Emotet is back in business
After a break of a month and a half, the Emotet botnet was revived on December 21st [1, 2],
and Microsoft spotted an ongoing campaign delivering "a wide range of lures in massive
volumes of emails, the use of fake replies or forwarded emails, password-protected archive
attachments."
"The new Emotet campaign still uses documents that contain malicious macro that, when
enabled, connects to seven malicious domains to download the Emotet payload," Microsoft
Security Intelligence tweeted.
Emotet was first spotted in 2014 as a banking Trojan and has now evolved into a botnet used
by the TA542 threat group (aka Mummy Spider) to deploy second-stage malware payloads
on infected systems.

The payloads Emotet drops on compromised computers include the QakBot and Trickbot
(which also deploys both Ryuk and Conti ransomware) trojans.
Before going on a break, Emotet has targeted multiple US state and local governments in
potentially targeted campaigns according to an advisory published by DHS-CISA in October.
