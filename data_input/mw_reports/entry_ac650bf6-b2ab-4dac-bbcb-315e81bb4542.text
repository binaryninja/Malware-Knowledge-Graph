Dark South Korea Total War Review

02/04/2013

As mentioned by different medias, security vendors and security researchers some South
Korean banks and broadcasting organizations went dark Wednesday 20 March, victim of a
cyber attack. Initial impacted broadcaster were KBS, MBC and YTN, and impacted banks
were Cheju, Nonghyup and Shinhan.
But by analyzing all the events related to this cyber attack we can see that the campaign was
more extended in time as mentioned and also more complex to understand. The campaign is
composed by different samples, created potentially by different authors with different
objectives. We can divide the reported samples in different categories:
Wipe: Objective of these samples is to erase all data’s of affected targets.
Drop & Wipe: Objective of these samples is to drop a wiper to erase all data’s of
affected targets.
Drop & Wipe & Deface: Objectives of these samples are to drop a wiper to erase all
data’s and deface website hosted by affected targets.
Drop & Backdoor: Objective of these samples is to install a backdoor, or trojan, on the
affected targets.
Unknown: These samples are potentially not related to the campaign.
I will try, through this blog post, to provide you the most reliable information’s as possible
regarding the Dark South Korea campaign.
According to different sources, and announced by the South Korean security
provider AhnLab the Thursday 21 March, “bad guys” got access to AhnLab Policy Center
and HAURI ViRobot ISMS, asset management tools, through stolen credentials in order to
massively spread Trojan.Jokra. But, regarding the latest news announced the 29 March, it

1/15

seem that AhnLab APC product was vulnerable to a login authentication bypass and that
this vulnerability was used by the bad guys in order to get access to APC and spread the
malware.
On Wednesday 20 March, AhnLab stocks gains of 6.5 percent (75,100 KW to 80,000 KW)
from stemming from expectations of demand for online security software following the
hacking incident. But after the 21 March AhnLab announcement, stocks were down 3.6
percent (from 80,000 KW to 74,700 KW). Since 21 March, AhnLab stocks have fallen
from 74,700 KW to 68,100 KW.

Remarks: Also known as K10 by Xecure Lab, mentioned as a wiper, but it is a dropper. This
sample could be categorized as Drop & Wipe.
Also, dropped “AgentBase.exe” is known as K01 on Xecure Lab, mentioned as a wiper only.
“AgentBase.exe” is a Windows wiper, but also the dropper for *NIX batch wiper aka
“~pr1.tmp“. More information’s in the “9263E40D9823AECF9388B64DE34EAE54

this sample on malware.lu. Symantec and McAfee have try to create a relation based on
the used packer and on some common compilation paths. But like McAfee, I don’t see any
relations between this dropper and the 03.20 Dark South Korea campaign. Known as K06 on
Xecure Lab. This sample could be categorized as Drop & Backdoor, or Unknown.

This sample was mentioned by Symantec and AhnLab the 23 March. Particularities of this
sample is that he will drop 2 files and inject 1 the files into “LSASS.exe” process as a DLL.
Also this sample will be executed any years the 20 March at 2pm and wipe MBR with
“HASTATI.” and “PR!NCPES” strings. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to find this sample. This
sample could be categorized as Drop & Wipe.

This sample was also mentioned the 20 March by different medias, security vendors and

hacked by a group calling itself the “Whois Team“.

9/15

Particularities of this sample is that he seem to be triggered only in certain conditions, and
this condition seem to be related to certain time zone, as mentioned by AhnLab the 23
March. The sample drop “mp.swf“, “lf.mp3“, “24mhk04.gif“, “25z18pg.jpg” files, adds
“MICRO_ESENCIAL0192301” as mutex, modify the
“SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management” following
registry entries, overwrite all “.html“, “.htm“, “.aspx“, “.asp“, “.jsp“, “.do“, “.php” files with its
code, terminate Windows Alerter service (Alerter) and Windows System Event Notification
Service (Sens), and drop all the MBR datas. This sample could be categorized as Drop &
Wipe & Deface.

file is present the wipe process is not started. This sample could be categorized as Wiper.

But you have to take in consideration that this sample is normally executed
by 9263E40D9823AECF9388B64DE34EAE54 dropper, and that a complete process will be
analyzed in the “9263E40D9823AECF9388B64DE34EAE54 Dropper Analysis” chapter of

Like the previous wiper, if “~v3.log” is present in “C:\WINDOWS\Temp\” directory, the wipe
process is not started.

This sample seems also to be part of a another dropper actually not publicly known. This
sample could be categorized as Wiper.
As you can see, all of the wipers use the “HASTATI” string in order to overwrite MBR data’s.
As reported by security vendors, “Hastati” term refers to a class of infantry in the armies of
the early Roman Republic. “PRINCPES” term, also used to overwrite MBR data’s, could also
refer to the “Principes” who were veteran soldiers of the Roman Pre-Marian Army. Are the
“bad guys” fan of Roman Army, or fan of Total War game ?
Also an interesting relation between the “HASTATI” string used to overwrite MBR data’s, is
that KBS TV website was defaced the 21 March with a “Defaced by HASTATI” message and
symbol representing the class of infantry in the armies of the early Roman Republic.

9263E40D9823AECF9388B64DE34EAE54 Dropper Analysis

In this chapter of this long blog post we will analyze some behaviors of
9263e40d9823aecf9388b64de34eae54 dropper.

13/15

As mentioned by different security vendors or researchers, when executed the dropper will
extract 4 files into Windows “%TMP%” directory. These files are “alg.exe“, “conime.exe“,
“~pr1.tmp” and “AgentBase.exe“.

“alg.exe” (e45cd9052dd3dd502685dfd9aa2575ca) is the “plink.exe” PuTTY tool acting as a
command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends. This binary has been compiled the 201302-15 at 08:12:58.
“conime.exe” (6a702342e8d9911bde134129542a045b) is the “pscp.exe” PuTTY tool acting
as a SCP client, i.e. command-line secure file copy. This binary has been compiled the 200603-13 at 14:32:44.
“~pr1.tmp” (dc789dee20087c5e1552804492b042cd) is a bash script who will be dropped
and executed on *NIX servers in certain conditions.
“AgentBase.exe” (db4bbdc36a78a8807ad9b15a562515c4) is the wiper mentioned in the
previous chapters of this blog post.
After installing these files, the dropper will check the presence of “~v3.log” file in
“C:\WINDOWS\Temp\” directory.
If the file “~v3.log” is not existing “AgentBase.exe” wiper will be executed, killing AhnLab
Policy Agent (pasvc.exe) and Hauri ViRobot ISMS Client (clisvc.exe), then erasing all data’s.
If the file “~v3.log” is existing, the dropper start to check the presence of configuration file
“confCons.xml” of mRemote program, developed by Felix Deimel, and the presence of
configuration files of SecureCRT program, developed by VanDyke Software, Inc.

14/15

For mRemote, the dropper copy all data’s, related to SSH connexions with root login,
present in “confCons.xml” configuration file and exploit a vulnerability present in the
password storage engine of this program. When you save connections in mRemote it
outputs all of that data into an XML report “confCons.xml“. The passwords are saved in an
encrypted format, however this is trivial to circumvent. So despite the passwords are saved
in encrypted format it is easy to decrypt them. This vulnerability was discovered and
published by Cosine Security the 2 Jun 2011. Support of mRemote has been stopped in
2012.
Once the mRemote vulnerability is exploited, the dropper start a new process to execute
“conime.exe” binary, in order to drop the “~pr1.tmp” file into “/tmp/cups” on the targeted
server:
“C:\Users\ERICRO~1\AppData\Local\Temp\conime.exe -batch -P 22 -l root -pw test
C:\Users\ERICRO~1\AppData\Local\Temp\~pr1.tmp 192.168.178.54:/tmp/cups”
After upload of “cups” file, the dropper will execute this file through the following command.
“C:\Users\ERICRO~1\AppData\Local\Temp\conime.exe -batch -P 22 -l root -pw test
192.168.178.54 “chmod 755 /tmp/cups;/tmp/cups”
For SecureCRT, the dropper is also copying all data’s, related to SSH connexions with root
login, present in “*.ini” configuration files. Each saved connection in SecureCRT as it ones
“*.ini” file who will be parsed by the dropper. The passwords are also saved in an encrypted
format.

With the latest version of SecureCRT (7.0.3), the dropper is unable to decrypt the password,
but will try to connect to targeted servers with a wrong password. So there is surely a similar
vulnerability as for mRemote in previous versions of SecureCRT, but wasn’t able to find it.
