We have discovered an unusual infection related to Xcode developer projects. Upon further investigation, we discovered
that a developer’s Xcode project at large contained the source malware, which leads to a rabbit hole of malicious payloads.
Most notable in our investigation is the discovery of two zero-day exploits: one is used to steal cookies via a flaw in the
behavior of Data Vaults, another is used to abuse the development version of Safari.
This scenario is quite unusual; in this case, malicious code is injected into local Xcode projects so that when the project is
built, the malicious code is run. This poses a risk for Xcode developers in particular. The threat escalates since we have
identified affected developers who shared their projects on GitHub, leading to a supply-chain-like attack for users who rely
on these repositories as dependencies in their own projects. We have also identified this threat in sources such as
VirusTotal, which indicates this threat is at large.
This blog will summarize the findings of this threat, while its accompanying technical brief contains the full details of this
attack. We detected the entry threat as TrojanSpy.MacOS.XCSSET.A and its command and control (C&C) related files as
Backdoor.MacOS.XCSSET.A.
This threat primarily spreads via Xcode projects and maliciously modified applications created from the malware. It is not yet
clear how the threat initially enters these systems. Presumably, these systems would be primarily used by developers.
These Xcode projects have been modified such that upon building, these projects would run a malicious code. This
eventually leads to the main XCSSET malware being dropped and run on the affected system. Infected users are also
vulnerable to having their credentials, accounts, and other vital data stolen.
Once present on an affected system, XCSSET is capable of the following behavior:
Using exploits, it abuses the existing the Safari and other installed browsers to steal user data. In particular, it
Uses a vulnerability to read and dump Safari cookies
Uses the Safari development version to inject JavaScript backdoors onto websites via a Universal Cross-site Scripting
(UXSS) attack

1/3

It steals information from the user’s Evernote, Notes, Skype, Telegram, QQ ,and WeChat apps
It takes screenshots of the user’s current screen
It uploads files from the affected machines to the attacker’s specified server
It encrypts files and shows a ransom note, if commanded by the server
The UXSS attack is theoretically capable of modifying almost every part of the user’s browser experience as arbitrary
JavaScript-injected code. These modifications include:
Modifying displayed websites
Modifying /replacing Bitcoin/cryptocurrency addresses
Stealing amoCRM, Apple ID, Google, Paypal, SIPMarket, and Yandex credentials
Stealing credit card information from the Apple Store
Blocking the user from changing passwords but also stealing newly modified passwords
Capturing screenshots of certain accessed sites
The method of distribution used can only be described as clever. Affected developers will unwittingly distribute the malicious
trojan to their users in the form of the compromised Xcode projects, and methods to verify the distributed file (such as
checking hashes) would not help as the developers would be unaware that they are distributing malicious files.
Further details of this attack may be found in its related technical brief.
