Foreword
Before joining Palo Alto Networks, I served 35 years in the US military, with the last 10 of those years
devoted to cyber-related assignments. During my tenure, I was able to see firsthand how ransomware was a
major threat to national security—and we’re still seeing it today.
Ransomware is one of the top threats in cybersecurity. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center,
there were 878 cyberattacks in 2020, 18% of which were recorded as ransomware.1 This threat is a focus
area for Palo Alto Networks. Our Unit 42 global threat intelligence and incident response teams worked
together to create the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report to provide the latest insights on the top
ransomware variants, ransomware payment trends, and security best practices so we can best understand
and manage the threat.
Put simply: ransomware is a lucrative business. The average ransom paid by organizations in the US,
Canada, and Europe increased from US$115,123 in 2019 to $312,493 in 2020—a 171% year-over-year
increase. With new tactics like double extortion, this number will only continue to rise.
Organizations around the world are being held hostage by ransomware, and many are being forced to
pay cybercriminals because they’re not equipped to combat the threat for varying reasons, from a lack of
recoverable backups to the cost of downtime outweighing the cost of paying the ransom.
We need to significantly reduce this criminal enterprise, which is why I’m proud that Palo Alto Networks is
a member of ​the Institute for Security and Technology’s Ransomware Task Force (RTF)​, in which I serve as
a co-chair.
The RTF is focused on developing a suite of recommendations for a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the
ransomware threat. To develop a set of solutions that will attack all sides of the ransomware scourge, the
RTF has recruited a large and diverse set of experts who are currently investigating a broad array of avenues
for recommendations—acknowledging all of the good work that has already been done in this space.
This means exploring questions like:
• What can we do to better prepare organizations for a ransomware attack?
• How can organizations understand and best respond to a ransomware attack?
• What are the greatest barriers for ransomware security adoption?
• How can we make it more difficult for ransomware actors to carry out an attack?
• How can we make the outcome of a ransomware attack less destructive?
• How can we create solutions tailored to the many different victims of ransomware attacks?
As these discussions progress, the task force aims to provide clear and actionable recommendations for
both public and private sector decision-makers internationally in spring 2021.
I believe resources like the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report will help us in this effort to learn
everything we can about this threat, enabling us to work across the public and private sectors to
collaboratively reduce the ransomware problem to something more manageable than the significant
threat we face today.

Executive Summary
To evaluate the current state of the ransomware threat landscape, the Unit 42 threat intelligence and
incident response teams collaborated to analyze the ransomware threat landscape in 2020 using
their global data.
This report details the top ransomware variants (with links to threat assessments for each
variant), average ransomware payments, ransomware predictions, and actionable next steps to
immediately reduce ransomware risk.

Cybercriminals Are Making, and
Demanding, More Money Than Ever
Note: The following data is from the US,
Canada, and Europe.
The average ransom paid for organizations
increased from US$115,123 in 2019 to
$312,493 in 2020, a 171% year-over-year
increase. Additionally, the highest ransom
paid by an organization doubled from 2019
to 2020, from $5 million to $10 million.
Meanwhile, cybercriminals are getting
greedy. From 2015 to 2019, the highest
ransomware demand was $15 million. In
2020, the highest ransomware demand
grew to $30 million.
Of note, Maze ransom demands in 2020
averaged $4.8 million, a significant increase
compared to the average of $847,344
across all ransomware families in 2020.
Cybercriminals know they can make money
with ransomware and are continuing to get
bolder with their demands.

Healthcare Organizations in the
Crosshairs
The world changed with COVID-19, and
ransomware operators took advantage of
the pandemic to prey on organizations—
particularly the healthcare sector, which was
the most targeted vertical for ransomware in
2020. Ransomware operators were brazen in
their attacks in an attempt to make as much
money as possible, knowing that healthcare
organizations—which needed to continue
operating to treat COVID-19 patients and
help save lives—couldn't afford to have their
systems locked out and would be more likely
to pay a ransom.

Ryuk ransomware stood out from the pack.
In October 2020, a joint cybersecurity
advisory was issued by the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the
Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), warning healthcare organizations
against Ryuk attacks.

The Rise of Double Extortion
A common ransomware attack consists of
the ransomware operator encrypting data
and forcing the victim to pay a ransom to
unlock it. In a case of double extortion,
ransomware operators encrypt and steal
data to further coerce a victim into paying a
ransom. If the victim doesn’t pay the ransom,
the ransomware operators then leak the
data on a leak site or dark web domain, with
the majority of leak sites hosted on the dark
web. These hosting locations are created and
managed by the ransomware operators. At
least 16 different ransomware variants are
now threatening to expose data or utilizing
leak sites, and more variants will likely
continue this trend.
The ransomware family that leveraged
this tactic the most was NetWalker. From
January 2020 to January 2021, NetWalker
leaked data from 113 victim organizations
globally, far surpassing other ransomware
families. RagnarLocker was second,
leaking data from 26 victims globally. It’s
worth noting that the US Department of
Justice announced in January 2021 it had
coordinated international law enforcement
action to disrupt the NetWalker ransomware
gang. The dark web domain managed by the
NetWalker operators, which hosted leaked
data, is no longer accessible.

2020 Top Ransomware Observations
COVID-19 Pandemic
Adversaries take advantage of current events to lure victims into opening phishing emails, visiting
fake websites, or downloading malicious files. Case in point: with the global impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, ransomware attackers heavily exploited it as a theme in ransomware attacks targeting
a variety of industries. While the healthcare sector was a top target throughout 2020 due to the
coronavirus, many industries suffered deeply from ransomware incidents.
Battling with a more fragile financial outlook throughout the year as well as the added challenges of
employees working from home, many businesses have had to make do with less. With fewer staff and
budget cutbacks, cyberthreat awareness and cybersecurity protections may be more difficult to implement.

Shifts in Approach
Ransomware has become increasingly easy to get hold of and is available in many formats targeting
multiple platforms. We’ve observed shifts from high-volume and spray-and-pray models to a more
focused “stay-and-play” model, where operators take their time to learn the victims and their networks,
following a more traditional network penetration approach.

Platforms Targeted
In addition to ransomware being observed on Microsoft Windows®, Apple macOS®, and mobile operating
systems, we are now seeing Linux being targeted as well.

Ease of Use and Availability
Adversaries understand that ransomware, specifically the ransomware as a service (RaaS) subscriptionbased model, is simple to execute, exceptionally effective, and potentially profitable—both from
direct payments and sale of valuable information. The RaaS model allows affiliates to utilize existing
ransomware software to carry out attacks, thereby earning a percentage of each successful ransom
payment.
Ransomware operators continue to gain access to victim environments through traditional methods,
including phishing, weak or compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, and exploiting
application/software vulnerabilities. Despite 2020’s larger remote workforce, these entry techniques
remained the same. Many operators are also combining commodity malware such as Dridex, Emotet,
and Trickbot for initial access. Once inside a network, adversaries use native tools such as PSExec and
PowerShell to enumerate the network and move laterally.

The Rise of Double Extortion
Several ransomware families—NetWalker, RagnarLocker, DoppelPaymer, and many others, as shown
in figure 1—have displayed their ability to exfiltrate data and use double extortion techniques. Instead of
only encrypting files on the victim host(s), operators exfiltrate files first to further coerce the victim into
paying the ransom. Exfiltrated files are then posted, or threatened to be published, on a public or dark web
leak site, with the majority of leak sites hosted on the dark web. These hosting locations are created and
managed by the ransomware operators. Some ransomware operators will further prove their knowledge of
a victim’s network environment by displaying the data in the form of directories or file trees.

Figure 1 gives a high-level overview of victims impacted by leak sites that were still live in January 2021.
This gives us an understanding of the enormous scale of the damage these ransomware operators are doing.
Most notably, NetWalker ransomware leaks lead the list at a staggering 33%, and other groups account for
7% or lower each. It is also important to highlight that a coordinated international law enforcement action
was conducted to disrupt the NetWalker ransomware gang on January 27, 2021. The dark web domain
managed by the NetWalker operators is no longer accessible.

Figure 1: Number of victim organizations globally, by ransomware
family, with data published on leak sites, Jan. 2020 – Jan. 2021

We also looked into the number of victim
organizations with data published on leaked sites by
region. As seen in figure 2, the Americas region was
hit the hardest, followed by EMEA (Europe, the Middle
East, and Africa) and JAPAC (Japan and Asia-Pacific).
Of the victim organizations with data published on
leak sites, the top three countries impacted globally
were the United States (47% of organizations), Canada
(12%), and Germany (8%). If these percentages are
parallel to how many organizations actually pay the
ransom, this could mean organizations in the US are
more profitable for ransomware operators to target
than others. Also, given the increasing acceptance
of cyber insurance solutions in countries like the US,
Canada, and Germany, many companies may decide
to pay the ransom if they are already covered by their
respective insurance providers. Figure 3 provides a
breakdown of figure 2 from a global perspective.

Figure 4: Numbers of victim organizations with data published
on leak sites globally by sector, Jan. 2020 – Jan. 2021
Figure 4 breaks down the victim organizations by their respective industries, showing the number of
organizations per industry where data was exposed to a leak site controlled by the ransomware operators.
Many of the operators have staged leaks of each organization’s data, likely in an effort to pressure victim
organizations into paying the ransom by a deadline, failing which the operators decide to leak the full
data. Published data from each organization ranged anywhere from 30 MB to more than 1000 GB.

The Reintroduction of DDoS Campaigns
Several ransomware families were identified using distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) against victim
websites as additional leverage. For example, the Avaddon ransomware operators have begun employing
DDoS attacks against victim organizations that do not cooperate with the actors during the negotiation
period. This concept is not new. In 2016 and again in 2019, operators were emailing DDoS threats to
ransom victims if they did not pay. However, 2020 reintroduced this destructive strategy.

Ransomware Incident Costs
Organizations of all sizes across many industries have been impacted by ransomware. Compared to
2019, we observed an increase of ransomware incident response cases across several industries in the
US, Canada, and Europe, as displayed in figure 5. While this figure depicts a summary of overall industry
targeting, it is not representative of the known increase in incidents across sectors such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and education. Ransomware engagements throughout 2020 were more complex than in
prior years, leading to longer, more in-depth breach response times.
Most notably, the information technology sector saw a 65% increase in ransomware incident response
cases from 2019 to 2020. As organizations shifted to remote workforces due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
ransomware operators adapted their tactics accordingly, including the use of malicious emails containing
pandemic-based subjects and even malicious mobile apps claiming to offer information about the virus.

Figure 5: Ransomware incident response cases by industry
in 2019 and 2020 in the US, Canada, and Europe
Additionally, ransomware actors are demanding more money year over year in the US, Canada, and
Europe. In 2020, ransom demands were an average of US$847,344, often requested in the form of bitcoin
or Monero cryptocurrency. This amount can vary dramatically depending on the ransomware family.
The total cost of a ransomware incident is also typically much more than the demand itself. In 2020, the
average cost of a forensic engagement (or incident response investigation) was US$73,851, even when
backups were considered a viable option for the organization. This number does not account for other
costs potentially accrued, monetary or otherwise, bringing the total average cost overall to a number that
would incapacitate many businesses.

2020 Top Ransomware Variants
2020 was a big year for ransomware. We saw both old and new families wreaking havoc on industries
globally. Ransomware operators took advantage of widespread COVID-19 concerns by conducting
phishing attacks containing pandemic-related themes and heavily targeted already overwhelmed
industries such as healthcare. While the following is not an all-inclusive list, Palo Alto Networks observed
these families during the 2020 calendar year.

Ryuk
Since August 2018, numerous industries, including government, healthcare, energy, and high tech, have been
targeted by Ryuk ransomware. Throughout 2020, we saw a significant increase in Ryuk ransomware attacks
targeting education, healthcare, and government/military organizations primarily within the US, but also in
the UK and Canada. A heavy focus was put on hospital systems, likely due to the necessity for uptime, as these
systems were overwhelmed with handling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We observed initial Ryuk ransom
requests ranging from US$600,000 to $10 million across multiple industries. Most often, these payments
were communicated using a ProtonMail account and requested in the form of bitcoin.
To gain access to a target system, Ryuk has successfully compromised hosts through malicious macros in
phishing documents, utilized commodity malware such as Trickbot, BazaLoader, and Emotet, and used
exploit techniques that allow malicious software to evade endpoint security products. In some cases, Ryuk
was installed weeks or even months after backdoor malware, such as Trickbot, was observed on that victim’s
host. In at least one instance, it was deployed after business hours using backup service accounts. Once they
gain access to a system, Ryuk operators will leverage RDP connections to deploy the Ryuk payload or move
laterally through the network. During active infection, Ryuk will close and encrypt all files, including their
own malicious document that resulted in the initial download. A file named “RyukReadMe” is placed onto
the system, and tools such as PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) are used to
enumerate the network while evading detection. Ryuk ransomware is believed to be associated with the threat
group Wizard Spider.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Ryuk ransomware.

Maze (ChaCha)
Maze ransomware, a variant of the ChaCha ransomware family, was first observed active around May
2019 and increased activity exponentially at the beginning of 2020. Using malicious Microsoft Word and
Excel phishing documents, Maze targeted organizations globally across many industries, exploiting
vulnerable external services using exploit kits such as Spelevo to gain access to victim environments.
Industries impacted by Maze include finance, healthcare, transportation and logistics, high tech,
telecommunications, construction and engineering, media and communication, and many others in the
US, UK, Canada, France, and Switzerland.
In late 2020, Maze began delivering its ransomware payload from within a virtual machine (VM) as
a means to evade detection. This novel technique was first observed in RagnarLocker and allows the
ransomware to deploy itself as a VM on nearly every targeted device it infects. The Maze file-encrypting
payload was delivered on a VirtualBox virtual disk image identified within a Windows MSI file. Also
included in the MSI file was a VirtualBox hypervisor used to run the VM. In some cases, the operators
deployed the payload days after establishing persistence on the network. Maze also uses various tools,
including Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, PowerSploit, and ProcDump, during campaigns.

10

Before file encryption, Maze operators could exfiltrate files for further leverage to get their desired
ransom payment. These files, or threats to expose these files, were posted to a leak site. In 2020, Maze
ransom demands averaged US$4.8 million, a significant increase compared to the average ransom
demand of $847,344 across all ransomware families in 2020. Direct communication with the operators
was through a Tor website.
In November 2020, the Maze actors announced their retirement from the ransomware scene. However,
their legacy appears to live on in the Egregor ransomware, which began to emerge just before this
announcement. These actions follow a similar pattern to that of the GandCrab ransomware group, which
announced retirement in May 2019, only to return under the REvil umbrella.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Egregor ransomware or Maze ransomware.

Defray777
Defray777, also known as RansomEXX and Target777, was first discovered in 2017. Run entirely in
memory, it is the first ransomware to have standalone executable files for both Windows and Linux,
where the Windows version will encrypt all files and the Linux variant will only encrypt directories
specified via a command line argument. Toward the end of 2020 and into 2021, Defray777 operators
began to display their ability to exfiltrate data. Data associated with victims of this ransomware began
appearing on the dark web. Defray777 is associated with the threat group PyXie and has targeted the
healthcare, education, manufacturing, government, construction and engineering, and high tech sectors
in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, France, and Brazil.
Between February and October 2020, we observed Defray777 alongside commodity malware such as
Trickbot and IcedID. Like many other ransomware families, Defray777 is delivered most commonly
via phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft documents or abusing software vulnerabilities.
Defray777 is executed using Cobalt Strike after installation of backdoor malware, such as Vatet, and upon
encryption renames files using a file extension such as .[unique ID][eight-digit hexadecimal number]
or containing 777 or .txd0t. Ransoms for this variant were recorded between US$16,000 and $42,000,
demanded via bitcoin.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Defray777 ransomware.

WastedLocker
One of the newest names in the ransomware game is WastedLocker. Since at least May 2020,
WastedLocker has been actively used against numerous industry verticals—primarily those with a
perceived large number of assets, which ultimately results in larger ransom requests that could be US$10
million or more. WastedLocker is associated with the threat group referred to as Evil Corp, the same
group responsible for Dridex and BitPaymer activities.
Between June and September 2020, Unit 42 observed WastedLocker targeting the information
technology, legal, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and transportation and logistics sectors in the US and
UK. These operators have been extremely successful with their ransomware infections thanks to some
of the malware features, including the ability to mask itself as a fake browser or other software update.
WastedLocker was developed with defense evasion in mind, as it contains the ability to bypass behaviorbased malware detection capabilities in anti-malware security software and transparently encrypts
cached documents in memory. The operators have also been observed using standard off-the-shelf
tools (e.g., Cobalt Strike and PSExec) not only for initial access, but also for system enumeration, lateral
movement, and command and control (C2) communications.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on WastedLocker ransomware.

GandCrab + REvil
Launched in January 2018, the GandCrab ransomware put a considerable dent in the pockets of many
organizations. Despite a retirement announcement in May 2019 and the arrest of a significant distributor
in July 2020, as well as a publicly available decryptor for multiple versions of the ransomware, we
continued to see GandCrab infection attempts at numerous organizations throughout 2020. In fact,
through November 2020, GandCrab made up approximately 45% of observed ransomware variants
collected from Unit 42 telemetry.
In April 2019, REvil ransomware (also known as Sodinokibi) began to emerge, targeting the professional
and legal services, manufacturing, media and communication, wholesale and retail, construction and
engineering, and energy sectors in the US, Australia, Canada, Finland, and Hong Kong. This ransomware
variant, likely developed by the same creators as GandCrab, continued to follow the traditional
ransomware-as-a-service model with a preference for RDP vulnerabilities or phishing for initial access.
Once in a system, the malware will attempt to initiate DNS requests to multiple domains followed by a
TLS 1.0 connection after DNS resolution.
In January 2020, the threat operators began to utilize double extortion methods, informing victims that
they would publicly expose stolen data if the ransom were not paid. Ransom demands were requested in
bitcoin and Monero, ranging from US$18,000 to $1.3 million.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on GandCrab and REvil ransomware.

NetWalker
NetWalker (sometimes referred to as MailTo) is yet another ransomware variant that has exposed
compromised victim data on the dark web, leaking data from more than 100 organizations heading into
2021. NetWalker has been actively deployed since August 2019, targeting the government, healthcare,
manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and energy sectors in the US, Canada, Saudi Arabia,
France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Pakistan, India, Thailand, UK, United Arab Emirates,
Colombia, and South Africa. Victim organizations found themselves with ransom demands ranging from
US$100,000 to $2 million in bitcoin.
NetWalker is PowerShell-based and executed directly in memory via reflective loading. It has been
delivered to organizations via phishing emails, weak RDP credentials, or exposed VPN and web
applications, and often spread via Server Message Block (SMB) remote execution using PSExec.
In January 2021, Tor sites used to communicate with NetWalker victims were taken down through a
coordinated effort with international law enforcement. NetWalker is a supporter of the ransomware affiliate
model. While many of the infected victims were asked to communicate with the operators through Tor, in at
least one case, the victims received communication through standard email. The primary communication site
may have been taken down. However, the malware still exists, and so does the capability to stand up new ways
to engage with victims. NetWalker is associated with the threat group Circus Spider.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on NetWalker ransomware.

DoppelPaymer
Another ransomware variant that emerged in 2019 and carried strong into 2020 is DoppelPaymer, a
known descendant of BitPaymer ransomware.
For its initial infection vector, DoppelPaymer has been observed using fake software updates. Once
downloaded and executed, the fake update will then download and execute second-stage malware
such as Dridex onto an infected system. Off-the-shelf post-exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike,
PowerShell Empire, and Mimikatz have also been observed during DoppelPaymer infections, as has
PSExec (specifically to facilitate lateral movement within compromised environments). Additionally, a
tool called Process Hacker, which can be used to terminate security services and processes, has also been
observed in these incidents.

Where approaches to victimization are concerned, the DoppelPaymer operators have hopped onto the
double extortion trend. In February 2020, they launched a leak site, threatened to sell data on the dark
web, and even created a Twitter account for general exposure. Additionally, according to the FBI, the
DoppelPaymer operators have been known to call victims to pressure them into paying ransoms.
In terms of victims themselves, DoppelPaymer operators have targeted state and local governments in
addition to industries including wholesale and retail, manufacturing, finance, insurance, transportation
and logistics, high tech, hospitality, and real estate within the US, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Belgium,
Italy, Norway, and Germany. DoppelPaymer ransom demands for 2020 were relatively high, ranging
from US$50,000 to $1.5 million, initially requested in bitcoin. DoppelPaymer is possibly associated with
the threat group Indrik Spider.

Dharma
One of the oldest ransomware families we still see actively deployed today, Dharma (also known as CrySIS
and Wadhrama) was first identified publicly in 2016. This ransomware typically spreads via fake software
installer files or phishing emails and leverages unsecured or weak RDP servers. Dharma attempts to
escalate privileges through the use of SMB. Files are often encrypted using the .cezar extension. However,
many other file extensions have been observed post-encryption. Dharma’s source code has been offered for
sale on hacking forums for as little as US$2,000. Available source code for malware such as Dharma could
mean more customization with other malware, resulting in more successful and damaging infections.
Dharma targeted the insurance, transportation and logistics, high tech, healthcare, and government
sectors around the US, Italy, Japan, and India with a focus on small and medium-sized businesses. Ransom
demands vary tremendously, having been observed as low as US$1,000 and as high as $150,000, requested
in bitcoin. These operators appear to prefer communicating with victims through standard email. Instead
of using an anonymizer service such as Tor like many other ransomware families, Dharma uses various free
email services, such as Tutanota, Gmail, Foxmail, and ProtonMail.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Dharma ransomware.

Phobos
Another offender that came into the ransomware scene around December 2019 is Phobos ransomware.
It is a likely variant of Dharma ransomware that leverages phishing using malicious Word documents or
URLs, and compromised or weak RDP credentials for system access. Phobos has utilized SMBv2 for lateral
movement. Files are often encrypted using the extension .phobos, but other file extensions have been
observed over time using the format .[ID][Email].[extension]. Phobos operators may also offer to decrypt
one or more files as proof of decryption capability and will do so for free as a good faith gesture.
Throughout 2020, Phobos targeted small and medium-sized businesses in the finance, education,
manufacturing, professional and legal services, insurance, high tech, construction and engineering,
healthcare, and energy sectors around the US, Portugal, Brazil, Seychelles, Romania, Indonesia,
Germany, and Japan. Ransom demands were requested in bitcoin and varied from US$8,000 to $50,000.
Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Phobos ransomware.

Zeppelin
Zeppelin ransomware, a possible variant of Buran/VegaLocker, has been actively used since at least
November 2019. This ransomware can be deployed in multiple configurations and creates two distinct
registry keys to store the encryption key. These keys are fairly distinct and quite prominently contain the
string “Zeppelin” within them.

In 2020, Zeppelin targeted the healthcare, high tech, manufacturing, finance, and real estate sectors
in the US, Canada, Bulgaria, Japan, South Korea, France, and Taiwan. Primarily, Zeppelin was deployed
through the use of weak RDP servers, malicious web advertisements, and invoice-themed phishing
emails with malicious macros. Also of note, this ransomware variant specifically checks a system’s IP
address on execution and will not fully execute if a given system appears to be located in Belarus, Russia,
Ukraine, or Kazakhstan. This indicates that the operators may be in or around these regions.
Like other ransomware families, Zeppelin has shown double extortion capability and interest in
exfiltrating documents prior to, or in lieu of, encryption to be sold on the dark web. Zeppelin ransom
demands appeared relatively consistent in their amounts across each targeted industry sector, ranging
from US$13,000 to $35,000 requested in bitcoin.

The Future of Ransomware
Reviewing activities throughout 2020 and looking back over the last several years, it’s easy to see the
ongoing trends with ransomware and which components have picked up more quickly than expected.

Ransomware-as-a-Service Model
The ease of success with ransomware attacks tells us that more financially motivated operators will
continue appearing on the scene. Adversaries of all kinds are continually looking for organizations to
target, and they know that ransomware is not only effective, but can also be low-effort, especially if
using the ransomware-as-a-service model. We expect more and more operators will follow this model
for all sums of money.

Increase in Variants and Capabilities
Some of the most prevalent ransomware families we observed throughout 2020 were less than a year old.
New and updated ransomware variants will continue to be developed and deployed for use as standalone
malware or alongside commodity malware. Additionally, with Linux being targeted more often, it is clear
that adversaries will continue to build out the capability to target all kinds of systems.

More to Adopt Double Extortion
Proof of compromise and double extortion techniques were also less than a year old heading into 2020,
but they have now exploded in popularity. At least 16 different ransomware variants are now threatening
to expose data or utilizing leak sites, and more variants will likely continue this trend. In this vein, the use
of Tor and other anonymous services will also continue to grow. The use of anonymized services makes it
more difficult for security researchers and law enforcement to track activities and identify indicators that
can be used for network defense.

Increasing Ransom Demands
The highest ransom demand has increased from US$500 to more than $30 million in just a few years
(doubling from $15 million in 2019 to $30 million in 2020). As long as attackers keep getting paid, these
demands will continue to rise. Very few operators make ransom demands in forms other than virtual
currency, generally favoring bitcoin, though Monero was also requested in several incidents we observed.

Continued Use of What’s Familiar
Much of the success of these operators lies in their ability to evade detection. Adversaries will continue to
infiltrate networks using traditional phishing and weak credentials, alongside tools native to the targeted
environments. This includes using post-exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, PowerShell
Empire, and PowerSploit.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Defending against ransomware attacks is similar to protecting against other malware. However, it
represents a much higher risk to the organization.

Initial Access
Initial access is relatively consistent across all ransomware variants. Organizations should maintain user
awareness and training for email security as well as consider ways to identify and remediate malicious
email as soon as it enters an employee’s mailbox. Organizations should also ensure they conduct proper
patch management and review which services may be exposed to the internet. Remote desktop services
should be correctly configured and secured, using the principle of least privilege wherever possible, with
a policy in place to detect patterns associated with brute-force attacks.

Backup and Recovery Process
Organizations should continue to back up their data and keep an appropriate recovery process in place.
Ransomware operators will target on-site backups for encryption, so organizations should ensure that all
backups are maintained securely offline. Recovery processes must be implemented and rehearsed with critical
stakeholders to minimize downtime and cost to the organization in the event of a ransomware attack.

Security Controls
The most effective forms of protection from ransomware are endpoint security, URL filtering or web
protection, advanced threat prevention (unknown threats/sandboxing), and anti-phishing solutions
deployed to all enterprise environments and devices. While these will not outright guarantee prevention,
they will drastically reduce the risk of infection from common variants and provide stopgap measures,
allowing one technology to offer a line of enforcement when another may not be effective.

Palo Alto Networks Capabilities
Cloud-delivered security services bring the network effect of thousands of customers across various
security technologies to coordinate intelligence and provide consistent protection across all attack
vectors. Deployed across our range of ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls—hardware PA-Series,
software VM-Series and CN-Series, and cloud-delivered Prisma® Access—our services eliminate the
coverage gaps generated by disparate network security tools:
• WildFire® malware prevention service detects activity associated with known and unknown ransomware
variants as well as other file-based threats.
• URL Filtering can be configured to block access to URLs in suspicious categories, preventing a host from
reaching out via HTTP to a web server Palo Alto Networks has seen host suspicious content/malware.
• Threat Prevention leverages the firewall's visibility to inspect all traffic and automatically prevent known
threats regardless of port, protocol, or SSL encryption, confronting threats at each phase of the attack. This
service can also detect brute-force attacks when the Vulnerability Protection profile is enabled.
• Enterprise Data Loss Prevention prevents an organization's sensitive data from leaving the enterprise network.
Cortex® XDR™ contains an anti-ransomware module as well as an exploit prevention and anti-malware
module that targets encryption-based activities associated with ransomware and other commodity
