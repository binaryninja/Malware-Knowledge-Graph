A man with dark hair and glasses working on a laptop in his home office.

Recent BitDefender wrote up a very detailed report on a loader that shares similarities with
WastedLocker being delivered via RIG exploit kit[1]. At the time I was researching Dridex
chains and since WastedLocker has code similarities with Dridex[2] and being leveraged by
EvilCorp[2,3,4,5,6] I took a quick look at the hashes from the report.
Of the hashes from the report only 1 seems publicly available,
6ee2138d5467da398e02afe2baea9fbe. In the BitDefender report they reference an overlap
with WastedLocker in what they label as ‘layer1’, this is actually the crypter layer meaning if the
crypter is private to one group then the overlap will show up in known malware associated with
this group.

Crypter Registry Check
After unpacking the malware we are left with a sample that lines with the BitDefender report but
some of the characteristics also line up with other the other malware families associated with
this group such as the love of hiding RC4 encrypted strings using a 40 byte key that is reversed
which is also used by Dridex and DoppelPaymer.

Copy key and reverse it

RC4
After beginning to decode some of the strings I started to notice that itlooks more and more like
a Dridex Loader. Small snippet of decoded strings below:

So I decided to check if the CAPE sandbox yara rule perhaps matches this unpacked sample
as a Dridex Loader[7], I used the rule from the CAPE decoder and it hit on the unpacked
sample. Along with the decoder being about to decode out the Dridex Loader config I believe it
is safe to say this is the Dridex Loader, leaving one to guess whether the other two samples are
also Dridex Loaders or not?
{'C2': ['51.68.224.245:4646', '188.165.17.91:8443', '173.255.246.77:691'], 'RC4_Key':
'v0vajEOvEWKQf2dajlupVdyIEZlAQX1T7H994Q', 'BOTNET': '10111'}
