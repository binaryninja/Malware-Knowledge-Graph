Our research team has found a sophisticated campaign, active for at least one year,
targeting large international companies in the energy, oil & gas, and electronics industries.
The attack also targets oil & gas suppliers, possibly indicating that this is only the first stage
in a wider campaign. In the event of a successful breach, the attacker could use the
compromised email account of the receipt to send spear phishing emails to companies that
work with the supplier. Thus using the established reputation of the supplier to go after more
targeted entities.
The attackers use typosquatted and spoofed emails to launch the attack. The campaign
spreads via phishing emails tailored to employees at each company being targeted. The
contents and sender of the emails are made to look like they are being sent from another
company in the relevant industry offering a business partnership or opportunity. Each email
has an attachment, usually an IMG, ISO or CAB file. These file formats are commonly used
by attackers to evade detection from email-based Antivirus scanners. Once the victim
opens the attachment and clicks on one of the contained files an information stealer is
executed.
Below we describe the attack vector, the attackers’ motives and tactics used in this
campaign, and how you can protect your systems from this attack.

Key Findings
The campaign uses spoofed or typosquatted emails to make them look like part of a
normal business-to-business (B2B) correspondence.
The attached file is primarily an IMG, ISO or CAB file containing information stealer
malware.
The dropped malware is generally able to steal private information, log keyboard
strokes and steal browsing data.

Attack Flow

The Campaign

2/13

Recently, we have identified a number of IMG files with names related to the oil & gas and
energy industries. Inside these image files are predominantly .NET malware. Upon further
investigation the distribution method for this malware appears to be spear phishing emails,
with either an IMG, ISO, or CAB file included as an attachment and sent to specific targets.
The IMG/ISO files are part of the Universal Disk Format (UDF) which are disk images
commonly used for DVDs. Cabinet (CAB) files are a type of archive file. In most of these
emails the file name and icon of the attachment mimics a PDF. The purpose is to make the
file look less suspicious, enticing the targeted individual to open and read it.
The campaign targets companies from around the world, including the United States,
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Germany, but its primary targets are South Korean
companies. The targeted industries are wide-ranging but mostly focused on the energy
sector.

The Emails
The emails are formatted to look like valid correspondence between two companies. This
extra effort made by the attacker is likely to increase the credibility of the emails and lure
victims into opening the malicious attachments. The emails use social engineering tactics
such as making references to executives, using physical addresses, logos and emails of
legitimate companies. They also include requests for quotations (RFQ), contracts, and
referrals/tenders to real projects related to the business of the targeted company.
The content of the emails demonstrates that the threat actor is well-versed in business-tobusiness (B2B) correspondence. The recipient email addresses of these emails range from
generic email handles such as “info@target_company[.]com” or
“sales@target_company[.]com” to specific people within companies. This suggests that
for some companies they have likely managed to gather more intelligence during
reconnaissance than others.
An example of one of the emails involved in the campaign (image below) uses a combined
cycle power plant (CCPP) project in Panama as a lure. The email pretends to be sent from
Hyundai Engineering Co (HEC). The email asks the receiver to submit a bid for the supply
of equipment in the project and states that more details and requirements can be found in
the attached file (containing the malware). The email presents a strict deadline for which the
request for the bid should be submitted.

Email Tactics
Typosquatting

4/13

In several emails it appears the sender domains have been typosquatted in order to
increase the credibility of the spear phishing attempt. Typosquatted domains are a
technique used to social engineer email recipients into thinking an email has been sent from
a trusted entity. This technique is performed by registering a domain name which mimics a
legitimate domain. When viewed quickly it can increase the chances of the recipient
thinking that the email has been sent from a legitimate company.
In this campaign, many of the typosquatted domains mimic South Korean companies with
legitimate domains in the format of <company.co.kr>. Typosquatting is achieved by
registering a domain without the second level “.co” and instead registering the domain as
<company-co.kr>. One example of this is the domain <hec-co.kr>, registered by the
attackers to typosquat the legitimate domain for the company Hyundai Engineering
(hec.co.kr). The typosquatted email from “Hyundai Engineering” invites the recipient to reply
to a confidentiality agreement with respect to a refinery expansion project.

Email sent from typosquatted domain (jeongwan@hec-co.kr).
Another typosquatted email that caught our attention was supposedly sent by Barend Jenje
from GustoMSC, asking to return a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The
attachment was just an IMG file containing a malware executable.
GustoMSC is based in The Netherlands, specializing in offshore equipment and technology
for the oil & gas industry. On June 14, 2021, GustoMSC posted an alert on their site
warning users that the company’s domain was being typosquatted and scammers were
sending emails on behalf of their employees.
The email below references the Dunkirk offshore wind farm project to add credibility to
the message. The project was granted to the Éoliennes en Mer de Dunkerque (EMD)
consortium by the French government in June 2019. The consortium is made up of several
5/13

companies, two of which are mentioned in the email: EDF Renouvelables and Enbridge. In
recent news, the companies announced their decision to move forward with the
development of the project beginning in the second half of 2021.
It would make sense then why the attackers name dropped this project, due to its recent
developments and also because the offshore wind farm is under the occupation of
GustoMSC.

Email Spoofing
Many email addresses in this campaign are spoofed by the actor. Email spoofing is another
tactic that is used to social engineer targets into opening emails. Email spoofing is done by
sending an email with forged headers to suggest that the email is sent from a trusted or
legitimate entity. An example of a spoofed email from this campaign pretends to come from
a company called Haesung Tech, seen below.

Spoofed email pretending to be sent from Haesung Tech.
This email is clearly spoofed since inside the header the Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
check does not pass. The reason for this is there is no DNS TXT record for
haesungtech.com that defines a permitted sender. The SPF verdict is shown below.

The Malware
This campaign uses several known Remote Access Tools (RATs) and information stealing
malware contained in the files attached to the phishing emails. Although the threats belong
to different malware families, they do share a number of capabilities including: stealing
private and banking information, logging keyboard strokes and stealing browsing data.

7/13

There are several known malware-as-a-service (MaaS) threats like Formbook and Agent
Tesla used in this campaign. Other threats we have identified are Loki, Snake Keylogger
and AZORult.
Each email has an attached file containing one or more executables encapsulated inside an
IMG, ISO, or CAB file, each belonging to one of the threats mentioned above. In Windows 8
and Windows 10, simply double-clicking on virtual disk files will automatically mount its
content. This feature is appealing for threat actors because it takes a small number of user
clicks to execute the malware. In addition, traditional email defenders do not handle disk
image files as well as more common formats such as ZIP files. Therefore, it’s more likely
that the malicious emails will end up in the inbox of the recipients without being
blocked. One of the emails we analyzed was allegedly sent by Rashid Mahmood from
China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC), a subsidiary of the
China National Petroleum Corporation. The recipient of the phishing email works for a
company called GS E&C, a Korean EPC contractor engaged in various global power plant
projects.

Phishing email sent to GS E&C.
The email contains a reference to the expansion project of an oil field in Abu Dhabi called
BAB. BAB is the oldest operating field in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The receiver of
this email, who works at GS E&C, is invited to submit both technical and commercial offers
for the items described in the attached material take off (MTO) document (below).

Second part of the phishing email sent to employee at GS E&C.
There is a typo in the email below. Instead of “regional headquarters” the address says
“Reginal Headquarter.” In addition to this mistake, the address provided is the actual
address of CPECC in UAE.

Phishing email with a typo.
Though the attached file has a seemingly complementary name related to the contents of
the email, it is actually an IMG file that contains Snake Keylogger malware. Once the user
double-clicks on the IMG file, the content of the file is mounted, as shown below, and the
user can click the file to be executed.

To bypass detection from standard Antiviruses, the execution of the malware is fileless,
meaning that it is loaded into memory without creating a file on disk. In this case, it performs
the same loading and execution process used to load Agent Tesla as reported by
BlackBerry.

We uploaded the attached file to Intezer Analyze. The file contains a malicious PE file that
shares code with other Snake Keylogger samples.

Targeting Companies in Religion Media Business
Among the targeted companies there is one that differs drastically from the others. The
company is FEBC, a religious Korean Christian radio broadcaster that reaches other
countries outside of South Korea, many of these countries which downplay or ban religion.
One of FEBC’s goals is to subvert the religion ban in North Korea.

Recommendations
Treat emails with awareness and caution, especially emails that are received from outside
your company’s domain. Most importantly, don’t open suspicious files or links.
Fileless malware is now very common. A recent blog by Panda Security states that fileless
malware rates in 2020 increased by 888% over 2019. Therefore, it is important to ensure
that your organization’s security strategy includes software that is able to detect malware
injected and executed in-memory. In case you come across a suspicious file, you can
upload it to Intezer Analyze to get an immediate verdict (trusted or malicious) and malware
family classification if it is indeed a malicious file. The platform supports a wide range of file
formats, including Windows and Linux executables, scripts and documents.
To summarize, don’t click on suspicious emails and make sure you have a solution that
handles fileless malware in-memory effectively. Intezer Analyze can help you with the latter.
Intezer Analyze now supports non-executable files such as Microsoft Office documents,
PDF files, and scripts such as PowerShell and VBS.
