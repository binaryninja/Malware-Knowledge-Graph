The Dynamically Stable Information Security Career

Executive Summary
The information security profession, in addition to being a large and growing field, is a
barometer of economic health and the changing nature of how business is being conducted.
Information security professionals are critical guardians in the protection of networked
operations and informational assets. Growth in this profession is a testament to the need
for their expertise and also a signal that global economic activity is advancing. Furthermore,
changes in information technology (IT) and evolving IT norms on how, when, and where
business operations occur—such as BYOD, cloud computing, and social media—remind us
that information security professionals must be highly adaptable in learning and applying new
skills, technologies, and procedures in order to manage a dynamic range of risks. Not to be
overlooked, hackers, attackers, and other threatening entities are also advancing and evolving.
Change and complexity in IT and IT norms represent new opportunities for them to succeed
in their nefarious pursuits. Consequently, information security professionals have no downtime;
there are always new risk management challenges to address.
It is against this backdrop that (ISC)2, in partnership with Booz Allen Hamilton, with the
assistance of Frost & Sullivan, conducted its sixth bi-annual worldwide survey of information
security professionals.1 This Web-based survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2012 was
both broad in scope (more than 12,000 respondents, a 19 percent increase over the 2011
survey) and deep in its queries. In addition to producing a rich profile of this profession and its
dedication to continuous training and education, this year’s survey intensified its focus on the
risk and response to BYOD, cloud computing, and social media. Secure software development,
touched on lightly in previous surveys, also garnered expanded focus in the 2013 survey. This
was done in recognition that software applications are increasingly under attack. Without a
corresponding response by security professionals and the technology vendors that support
them, this “soft” underbelly of business and governmental entities has and will continue to be
exposed with serious consequences—data breaches, disrupted operations, lost business, brand
damage, and regulatory fines. Secure software development, more than any other
discipline, is where the largest gap between risk and response attention by the
information security profession exists. Other notable survey findings include:
• Information security is a stable and growing profession – Information security
professionals are very stable in their employment; more than 80 percent had no change in
employer or employment in the past year, and the number of professionals is projected to
continuously grow more than 11 percent annually over the next five years.
• (ISC)2 membership and location drive higher salaries – The salary gap between
(ISC)2 members and non-members is widening. Comparatively on a regional basis, 79
percent of information security professionals in developed countries in the Americas have
average salaries of US$80,000 or more, whereas only 12 percent of respondents located
in APAC developing countries do.

• Even with past annual growth in the double-digits, workforce shortages persist –
Fifty-six percent of respondents believe there is a workforce shortage, compared to two
percent that believe there is a surplus. The impact of shortage is the greatest on the
existing workforce.
• Knowledge and certification of knowledge weigh heavily in job placement
and advancement – Broad understanding of the security field was the #1 factor in
contributing to career success; followed by communication skills. Nearly 70 percent view
certification as a reliable indicator of competency.
• Application vulnerabilities rank the highest in security concern – Malware
and mobile device are close seconds. Mitigating the risk from these and other security
concerns to the organization’s reputation is the highest priority.
• While attack remediation is anticipated to be rapid, security incident
preparedness is exhibiting signs of strain – Twenty-eight percent believe their
organizations can remediate from a targeted attack within one day. Yet, with regard
to being prepared for a security incident, a doubling of the percentage of 2013 survey
respondents believe their preparedness has worsened compared to the respondents in
the 2011 survey.
• Information security professionals trump products in securing infrastructure
effectiveness – In a ranking of importance in securing infrastructure, software and
hardware solutions rank behind the effectiveness of information security professionals.
• Security concern is high for BYOD and cloud computing – Protecting sensitive
information contributes to the security concern noted in both of these IT trends. Security
concern with social media is significantly lower than in 2011 as organizations leverage existing
security technologies and policy mechanisms to manage this communication channel.
• New skills, deepening knowledge, and a wider range of technologies needed –
A multi-disciplinary approach is required to address the risks in BYOD and cloud computing.
With cloud computing, organizations balance the type of cloud environment with their
level of acceptable risk and ability to control risk. For example, with security concern
regarding cloud computing being high, private clouds, where the customer has greater
control in security risk management, are chosen more frequently than public clouds.
Survey Objective and Methodology
The 2013 Global Information Security Workforce Study (GISWS) was conducted in
September-December of 2012 through a Web-based survey, approximately 25 minutes in
length. The study’s objective is to gauge the opinions of information security professionals
regarding trends and issues affecting their profession and careers. Designed to capture
expansive viewpoints and produce statistically significant results, a total of 12,396 surveys of
qualified information security professionals were collected.The diversity of survey respondents
is reflected in the survey respondent profiles shown on the next page.

Security Threats and Vulnerabilities, Implications and State
of Readiness
As reported in previous GISWS surveys, there is no lack of diversity in the threats and
vulnerabilities information security professionals are tackling—and concerned about. All of the
12 threats and vulnerabilities presented in the survey were selected as top or high concerns for
36 percent or more of the survey respondents. At the top of the list, application vulnerabilities,
malware, and mobile devices were each identified as a top or high concern by two-thirds or
more of the respondents.

Greater examination of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), including mobile devices, cloud
computing, and social media, and their security implications and how information security
professionals are responding, is included later in this paper. Secure software development, the
upfront means to lessen application vulnerabilities, will also be examined later in this paper.
Focusing deeper into the responses on threats and vulnerabilities reveals that concern
severity varies.
• Some perspectives change over time – Comparing this year’s survey to the 2011
results, the level of concern is fairly stable. However, there was a notable increase in
cloud-based services. Compared to the 49 percent of respondents that view cloud-based
services as either a top or high security concern in the 2013 survey, 43 percent viewed
it as a top or high security concern in the 2011 survey. We believe this increase follows
the increased adoption of cloud-based services over the two-year period since the last
survey, combined with the resilient security concerns, real and perceived, associated with
cloud-based services.
• C-levels and officers rated nearly all threat and vulnerability categories
higher than respondents in other job titles – This was most notable in application
vulnerabilities and mobile device security. Top or high concern was selected by 72 percent
of C-levels and officers for application vulnerabilities and 70 percent for mobile devices.
• Size and anxiety is correlated – In all threat and vulnerability categories, the average
level of concern increased as company size increased. Perhaps the bigger the company is,
the more resources it devotes to examining these threats and through that examination,
gains a more comprehensive and realistic appreciation of risk and risk implications. Also,

from the “greatest gain for the effort mentality,” larger companies represent more lucrative
targets for attackers and hackers, thus contributing to a higher level of concern among
large company respondents.
• Vertical equates to variability – The nature of a company’s business and operations
also has implications on being a target and with that, variation in concern. No surprise,
respondents in the banking, insurance, and finance verticals, with their possession and
use of valuable and exploitable personally identifiable and financial information, view
the threats posed by hackers, hacktivists, and organized crime higher than the majority
of other verticals. Government respondents, also not a surprise, view the threat of
state-sponsored acts and cyber terrorism as a greater security concern (i.e., choosing top
or high concern) over private enterprises by more than 20 percentage points in each of
these threat categories.
• Developing countries express higher level of concern – Survey respondents located
in developing countries state a higher level of concern for a majority of the threat and
vulnerability categories versus respondents in developed countries. Directly contributing
to this is that information security investments in developing countries are historically
less than the global average. This is reflected in the lower level of security certifications in
developing versus developed countries. For example, with the most popular certification
chosen by survey respondents—Certified Information Systems Security Professional
(CISSP®)—only 42 percent of the survey respondents located in developing countries
(members and non-members combined) had acquired and maintained this certification,
versus 71 percent of respondents located in developed countries.2
Threats and vulnerabilities have implications—attackers are successful and vulnerabilities are
exploited. To that point, the survey asked respondents to rank their organizations’ priorities:
In other words, what needs to be avoided? As shown, damage to the organization’s reputation,
breach of laws and regulations, and service downtime represent the top three to-be-avoided
outcomes. Also noteworthy is the high percentage of top-priority selections. For example,
49 percent of all survey respondents rated damage to the organization’s reputation as a
top priority. In fact, five of the nine categories received a top-priority rating by more than
one-third of the survey respondents. Conclusion: the “protect and secure” activities of
information security professionals are strongly aligned with many high priorities
of their organizations.

Perhaps an indication of information security professionals’ improving ability to allay a subset
of outcomes, the percent of respondents in the 2013 survey selecting top or high concern
for service downtime, customer privacy violations, theft of intellectual property, and lawsuits
was down 3-5 percentage points from the 2011 survey for these categories. These reductions
notwithstanding, these categories remain high priority.
Notable variation in priority ratings among job titles, company sizes, and verticals are:
• Auditors’ aim is clear – In keeping with the role of auditor, survey respondents that
chose this job title prioritize breach of laws and regulations higher than all other job titles.
Also aligned with their roles, managers and security analysts placed a higher priority on
service downtime than the other job titles.
• Priority rises with company size – Like security concerns, priority ratings rose with
company size.
• Top priority varies among verticals, logically – Sixty-three percent of banking,
insurance, and finance respondents selected damage to the organization’s reputation as
top priority. In healthcare, 59 percent chose customer privacy violations as top priority.
Fifty-seven percent of construction respondents chose health and safety as a top priority,
and 50 percent of telecom & media respondents view service downtime as top priority.
With a diversity of threats and vulnerabilities to be concerned with and the need to avoid a
range of undesirable outcomes, it is logical to ask about preparedness. In a repeat of the 2011
survey, the 2013 survey requested the respondents judge their change in readiness relative
to 12 months earlier (perform better, worse, or same). The results for both surveys are
summarized in the following table.

While the majority of respondents believe that their organizations would perform better or
the same relative to 12 months earlier, there was a 10-point or more decline in the percent
of respondents believing they would perform better in the 2013 survey compared to the
2011 survey. Not as significant, but equally disconcerting about improvement in the state

The percent of survey respondents with certifications other than CISSP (e.g., ITIL, CISA, and Security+) was materially lower,
and the difference between developed and developing countries was less (10 percentage points difference or less).

The Dynamically Stable Information Security Career

of readiness, twice the percentage of respondents in the 2013 survey view their readiness
has worsened in the past year as did respondents in the 2011 survey. As an indication
that membership really matters, the survey-over-survey decline in the percent
of respondents selecting “better,” and increase in selecting “worse,” was not as
profound with member respondents compared to non-member respondents.
Other noteworthy observations from the 2013 survey on these readiness categories include:
• C-levels and the rank-and-file differ – Respondents with C-level and officer job titles
were decidedly more optimistic on readiness; they chose “perform better” by a greater
percentage than respondents in all other job title categories.
• Largest companies more optimistic – In all three categories of readiness, a greater
percentage of the largest companies (10,000 employees or more) viewed that their readiness
had improved versus smaller companies. Reflecting the correlation between readiness and
training, and smaller companies being less optimistic on their readiness than large companies,
a greater percent of survey respondents in companies with 2,500 or fewer employees than
larger companies indicated spending on training and education increased in the past 12
months and is expected to increase over the next 12 months as well.
• Battle-tested banking, finance, and insurance verticals confident they are
turning the tide – Respondents in these industries chose “perform better” to a greater
extent than all other verticals in all three categories. Conversely, the respondents in the
less battle-tested utilities vertical chose “perform worse” to a greater extent than any
other vertical.
Another survey question focused on readiness is how quickly damage from a targeted attack
would be remediated. Slightly more than two-thirds of the respondents project that they could
remediate the damage from a targeted attack within a week or less. Yet, there is also a material
portion of the respondents that are unsure how long damage remediation might take.

• As typical, C-levels voiced greater assurance on their organizations’
readiness – C-levels and officers chose “within one day” or “don’t know” less than
respondents with job titles farther down the organizational structure—31 percent and
10 percent, respectively.

• Smallness advantage – With a less diverse and smaller spread of operations, 31 percent
of small companies (less than 500 employees) believe they can remediate in one day
and 44 percent within a week. This is a faster expectation than very large companies
(10,000 or more employees)—28 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Also, respondents
in very large organizations chose “don’t know” to a greater extent (18 percent) than small
companies (12 percent).
• Experience advantage – Banking, insurance, and finance verticals, plus the info tech
vertical, believe they can respond faster than other industries; 34 percent and 32 percent
of respondents in those verticals, respectively, predicted within one day to remediate.
Potentially due to highly distributed operations, respondents in the retail & wholesale and
construction verticals chose “don’t know” at higher levels—19 percent and 20 percent,
respectively. Potentially, a lack of experience in past remediation efforts influenced 20
percent of respondents in the utilities vertical to choose “don’t know.”
People are a Key Tool in Information Security
With the pervasiveness, diversity, and evolution in security threats, information security
professionals use an assortment of tools. Top of the list are human aspects: management
support, qualified staff, and policy adherence, with half or greater of respondents
choosing very important for each. The next four categories also have a human aspect.
Security software and hardware are materially farther down the list of essential tools in
effective security; confirming the viewpoint that the effectiveness of security technologies is
maximized only when the trained human element is actively incorporated.

Other observations include:
• Compared to the 2011 survey, the average importance ratings were essentially unchanged
in the 2013 survey.
• C-levels and officers indicated a higher importance on access to executives than
respondents in other job titles, indicating that these respondents believe their greatest
influence occurs at their peer level.

• As organization size increases, importance on human assets increases, whereas the
importance of hardware and software is even across company sizes.
• Across industry verticals, respondents in the government place higher importance on
hardware and software solutions than the companies in the private sector.
• Secure software development is viewed as more important by banking, finance,
and insurance; info tech; retail and wholesale; and telecom and media verticals.
Concentrating on select security technologies that provide significant improvement in system
and network security (those that garnered more than 10 percent of respondent selection),
two technologies were highlighted by the survey respondents for their capabilities: network
monitoring & intelligence, and intrusion detection & prevention.

Other perspectives are:
• Aside from the technologies shown, no other selectable technology in the survey gained
more than one percent of survey respondents’ votes. Other selectable technologies
included: authentication, network access control (NAC), and security incident and event
monitoring (SIEM).
• There was no tangible difference in selection frequency by company size or job title.
• Owing to the public-facing attribute of their businesses, Web security applications had the
greatest frequency of votes by the banking, finance, and insurance; education; info tech; and
retail and wholesale verticals. Healthcare respondents selected policy management and
auditing tools in greater numbers than respondents in other verticals.

Need and Budget for the Right Information
Security Professionals
With security staff viewed as critical in importance, it is equally important to understand the
acuteness of need, organizations’ ability to fund staff expansion and improvement, and the
sought-after attributes of information security professionals.
The need is present
• Very few respondents view their security organizations as being over-staffed.
Nearly one-third of respondents believe they have the right number of staff, but more than
50 percent believe staff expansion is justified.
• The good news is that two-thirds of C-levels, those with the greatest budgetary influence,
view their security organizations as being too few in numbers.
• More midsize companies’ (500-2,499 employees) respondents view their organizations as
understaffed versus smaller and larger size companies.
• Across industries, a greater percentage of respondents in education, healthcare,
manufacturing, and retail & wholesale verticals believe they are understaffed.

The strain of understaffing is felt greatest on the existing security workforce—
greater than the overall organization, security breaches, and customers.
The reasons for an inability to bridge the need for additional information security
workers are fueled by three factors: business conditions, executives not fully
understanding the need, and an inability to locate appropriate information security
professionals. Other reasons provided by respondents—such as economy, lack of funding or
budget, and staffing cuts or layoffs—were volunteered by one percent or less of the respondents.
Across verticals, respondents in info tech view an inability to find qualify personnel as a larger
impediment to staffing than other verticals. When asked which job title experienced the greatest
workforce shortage, security analyst (chosen by 47 percent of respondents) topped the list, followed
by security engineering-planning and design (32 percent), and security auditor (31 percent).

Budget availability to increase spending is strong
An increase in spending is predicted by nearly one-third of survey respondents in personnel,
training and education, and hardware and software. Slightly more than 10 percent, however,
predict a decline. This decline is more prevalent in government (approximately 19 percent
of respondents predicting declines) versus private sector (approximately 10 percent of
respondents predicting declines). More than any other private sector vertical, 35 percent of
respondents in the info tech vertical predict spending increases.

Sought-after attributes in information security professionals
When examining the sought-after attributes of information security professionals,
it is not just the skills that are important. Confirmation of those skills (i.e.,
certification) and professionals’ engagement in peer groups (i.e., affiliations) are
also essential. The importance attached to each is examined in this section.
Skills
Across the entire survey, broad understanding of the security field was on top in terms
of importance, followed by communication skills. Technical knowledge, awareness and
understanding of the latest security threats round out the top four.

Government-defense is most emphatic on this point; 84 percent state certification is required,
and a distant, but still high, second is info tech at 47 percent.
While regulations are a primary driver for certification in government-defense, that is an
anomaly. The private sector overwhelmingly (74 percent) views certification as an indicator of
competency. The correlated quality of work was the second highest reason.

Information Security is a Rewarding and Resilient Profession
The importance of the information security profession has been clearly articulated in this survey
by the respondents, which does include bias as they have chosen this career. To gain a more
unbiased confirmation of the importance of this profession, the survey asked respondents to
weigh in on the uniform measuring sticks of all careers: salary, change in salary, and job stability.
In terms of salary, the average annual salary across all survey respondents is US$92,835.
As expected, C-levels and officers reported the highest average annual salary at US$106,151.
The respondents in government-defense and healthcare reported the highest average annual
salaries at US$101,246 and US$98,037, respectively.
In comparing average annual salaries for members and non-members between
the 2013 and 2011 surveys, the member average salary is higher, and the salary
gap between members and non-members is widening. Recognizing that many factors
influence salary—job title, location, security certifications, and tenure—a narrower examination
on salary is appropriate.To gain the greatest confidence possible in salary comparisons with the
survey data, we selected the job title and location with the greatest number of respondents:
security analyst located in the U.S. As displayed, U.S.-based security analysts that
are (ISC)2 members, on average, have a higher salary—23 percent greater than
U.S.-based security analysts that are non-members. (see chart on next page)

Part of the reason for the higher salaries is tenure; (ISC)2 security analyst members
located in the U.S. averaged 35 percent longer careers than non-members. And, as
shown, tenure distribution is skewed to the right for members. The conclusion from these two
comparison charts between members and non-members is that for one job title in one country,
member professionals sustain a longer career and receive higher rewards (i.e., pay). We project
that a similar finding would be confirmed with other job titles and locations, provided there is
a sufficient number of respondents to produce statistically significant comparisons.

There are no notable differences in this distribution of salary changes by either job title or
company size in the 2013 survey. There are, however, differences among the verticals. These
differences provide an indication of which verticals are using salary to retain and reward security
professionals more than other verticals. For example, 11 percent of respondents in the info
tech vertical reported receiving a salary increase of more than 10 percent in 2012. Conversely,
education and government are not rewarding their information security professionals to the
same degree. Forty-four percent and six percent of education respondents reported no change
or reduction in salary, respectively, in 2012. For respondents in government, the results are
similar: 45 percent reported no change and five percent reported a salary reduction.
Another notable comparison in salary differences is across region and developmental stage

This table reflects Frost & Sullivan’s best estimate and projection of 2010 - 2017 employment of information
security professionals. Professionals in both managerial and operational roles are included. Data from a variety
of sources, including credible secondary sources and internal research was incorporated. This year’s forecast
is slightly less than the employment forecast developed two years ago due to refinement in the forecasting
methodology. Greater emphasis was placed on correlation analysis with Frost & Sullivan’s sizing of global market
expenditures on security products and services, and with regional variations contained in the survey data.

Secure Software Development: Essential but
Under-Supported
Application vulnerabilities was the number one security concern for survey respondents.
Closer examination reveals that the secure software development concern
increases with company size, perhaps correlated with the greater amounts of
software development in large companies versus smaller companies that rely
heavily on commercial applications. Also, the importance of secure software
development was rated above software and hardware solutions in securing the
organization’s infrastructure. Here, too, there is variance associated with company size. In
particular, as company size increases, the importance of secure software development relative
to the importance of software and hardware solutions also increases.
Recognizing that software procurement and development involves multiple phases, the level of
security concern may fluctuate among these steps. According to the survey respondents, this
is true but within a fairly narrow range in the pre-installation steps.

The risk implications of these concerns are most notable in the proportion of detected security
breaches attributed to insecure software. According to survey respondents, insecure software
was a contributor in approximately one-third of the 60 percent of detected security breaches.
In the other 40 percent of detected breaches, insecure software’s role was uncertain either
because post-breach forensics were inconclusive, or the survey respondents were not privy
to the forensics. Regardless of this uncertainty, along with insecure software’s unquantifiable
attribution in undetected breaches, information security professionals are certain that their
concerns regarding insecure software are justified.

The next question is, what is being done to mitigate or resolve the risk of insecure
software? This mitigation begins by being involved in software development, procurement,
and outsourcing. According to survey respondents, approximately 50 percent state that
someone other than themselves from their security organizations is engaged in software
development, procurement, and outsourcing. Not so promising of information security
professionals’ involvement is the substantially lower percent personally involved
in software development (12 percent), procurement (20 percent), and outsourcing
(10 percent). Considering the size and comprehensive reach of the GISWS, and the high
level of concern and attributed risk assigned to insecure software, this survey observation is
one signal that a material gap exists between risk and response.

considerably. This, too, is a signal of a gap between risk and response by information
security professionals and their organizations.

As reported previously in this study, information security professionals, members, and
non-members, view acquiring new skills and certification as very important. Earning
certifications most applicable to secure software, however, is hardly a blip on
the list of certifications survey respondents claim. For example, only one percent
of surveyed information security professionals claim to have acquired the Certified Secure
Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP®) certification.This is also a signal that the gap between
insecure software risk and response is real.

The Dynamically Stable Information Security Career

The conclusion is apparent: unless software and information security professionals’ involvement
is deepened in secure software development, procurement, and outsourcing; and training and
education permeates the ranks of software development functions, the risks associated with
insecure software will remain. Furthermore, deepening engagements in software
development cannot occur in isolation or be the exclusive responsibility of the
information security workforce. Other relevant functional groups—software
developers, application owners, and the quality assurance and testing teams—must
internalize secure software development best practices and engage, as standard
operating procedure, with information security professionals. While expertise in the
information security discipline varies across groups, all groups must be responsible in order for
the risk and consequences of insecure software to decrease.
Security Implications of BYOD, Cloud Computing,and Social Media
In this section, we zero in on the survey responses to three prominent IT trends: BYOD, cloud
computing, and social media. Each is unique in their security implications and how information
security professionals and their organizations are managing risk. For example, assessment of
security risk is not uniform. BYOD is the highest overall, followed by cloud computing and
social media. We believe that the “it’s just happening” and “happening at accelerating speed”
with BYOD are forcing organizations to react more than with cloud computing, where adoption
and use is more of a managed choice by companies. Consequently, the risk in BYOD is
“cast upon” businesses more so than evaluated and chosen with cloud computing.
Social media is different. While social media, too, has the “cast upon” attribute of BYOD, social
media represents more of an evolution in internal and external communication channels than
the introduction of a mushrooming range of user-owned and therefore untrusted user devices.
As such, companies have experience in managing the risk of unauthorized communications
(e.g., when instant messaging and Web-based email became broadly available), with many of the
same and existing technologies and procedures to monitor and manage the communication
flows. Consequently, the security risk with social media is less than BYOD.

BYOD
Approval for use of user-owned devices, according to this survey, is more than 50 percent.
Differences in allowance do exist, primarily among verticals. For example, 67 percent of
respondents in government state user-owned devices are not allowed. In the private sector,
47 percent of respondents in banking, insurance, and finance verticals state user-owned
devices are not allowed. At the other end, education is most permissive, with 86
percent of education respondents claiming user-owned devices (employee and
business partners combined) are allowed.

End-user license agreements are one way that companies manage BYOD risk. Fifty-one percent
of survey respondents claim agreements are in use. Beyond these agreements, a growing
number of security technologies are used. Furthermore, all mobile security technologies listed
in the 2011 survey (encryption, remote lock and wipe, MDM, mobile anti-malware, and DRM)
had a greater percent of respondents claiming use in 2013. Also as a sign of expanding
security technologies in use are the modest percentages assigned to technologies
that were in their commercial infancy in 2011, such as secure containerization
or secure sandbox, with 20 percent of respondents stating it is used in the
2013 survey.

Cloud Computing
The GISWS confirms the prevailing use of cloud computing is the greatest with large companies
(2,500 or more employees). Among industry verticals, the cloud computing priority varies
moderately. Respondents in info tech have the highest cloud computing priority; 57 percent
chose top- or high-priority cloud computing currently and expect priority to rise to 69 percent
in two years. Government respondents express the lowest current and future cloud computing
priority ratings (top and high)—26 percent and 45 percent, respectively.

Selection among cloud computing approaches corresponds to the high level of risk
currently associated with the cloud. As shown in the table below, private cloud computing
services have the greatest proportionate use. With private cloud computing services, the cloud
customer retains more control over the cloud infrastructure and how that infrastructure is

The chart above lists the skills information security professionals believe are needed to manage
cloud risks. The very high percentage of respondents choosing “understanding”
skills is indicative that there remains considerable ambiguity regarding cloudrelated risks. Furthermore, with cloud services providers not bound by industry standards
or regulations with regard to security practices and procedures, general understanding of
potential cloud risks would be incomplete in assessing risk. A thorough understanding of each
potential cloud service provider would be required to adequately assess risk across providers.
Social Media
As previously shared, the security concern with social media is less than BYOD and cloud
computing. Nevertheless, there is sufficient concern that a majority of information security
professionals take action to manage the risk emanating from social media use. The most
prominent means to limit access to social media is by using content filtering and website
blocking technologies. The prominence of these technologies is greater with larger companies
than small. Not surprisingly, higher proportions of medium, large, and very large companies
surveyed use this technology for social media access control than small companies. Also
as expected, survey respondents in the banking, insurance, and finance verticals expressed
greater use (82 percent) of these technologies than any other vertical. Respondents in the
education vertical are the most permissive in social media access; 59 percent state
their organizations have no social media restrictions.

The Last Word
The professional discipline of information security is complex and requires continuous
investment in knowledge, procedures, and technologies. Moreover, the application
of information security is the duty of all members of the organization. From a practical
perspective, there is a shared need to protect what is important—sensitive information
and critical business operations—and a shared responsibility as system users and their
devices represent a widely distributed and dynamic field of entry points into public and
private networked operations and informational databases. Without organizationally broad
awareness and attentiveness to security policies, risk will surely rise and, as a consequence,
contribute to sub-optimized effort by information security professionals. More time will be
driven to incident response and remediation, and away from proactive building of security
practices that meet the organization’s risk management objectives and directly contribute to
strategic business initiatives (e.g., development and implementation of cutting-edge software
applications, mobilizing workforce and operations, and extracting maximum benefits from
the evolution in information technologies, such as cloud computing).
For those who have chosen a career in information security, it is a rewarding profession both
intellectually and financially. And while skill and knowledge building must never slow down—
attackers, hackers, and other cyber threat actors certainly will not—information security
professionals must also translate their risk management expertise into organization-wide
leadership. Consider if those with the greatest understanding of risk management operate
in isolation or, worse, choose to violate security policies. Members of other functional areas
in the organization will view information security as an optional responsibility and be equally,
if not more, cavalier in their adherence to security policies. Therefore, it is incumbent upon
information security professionals to demonstrate security consciousness, and openly and
freely engage with members of other departments to show how security is best when
practiced together.
