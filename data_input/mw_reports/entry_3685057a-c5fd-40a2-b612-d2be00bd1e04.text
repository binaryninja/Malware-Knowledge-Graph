This post describes the technical analysis of a new campaign detected by Intezer’s
research team, which initiates attacks with a phishing email that uses conversation hijacking
to deliver IcedID.
The underground economy is constantly evolving with threat actors specializing in specific
fields. One field that has bloomed in the last few years is initial access brokers. Initial
access brokers specialize in gaining an initial beachhead access to organizations and once
achieved, sell the access to other threat actors that monetize it further.
Some of the customers to initial access brokers buy the access to deploy ransomware.
Proofpoint has identified ten access brokers that sell access to ransomware groups. These
access brokers largely infect their victims with banking trojans that are later used to deploy
another malware at the “purchaser’s request.”
One of these banking trojans that have been used to deploy ransomware is IcedID
(BokBot). IcedID was first reported on by IBM X-Force in November 2017 and the malware
shared some code with Pony. While initially designed to steal banking credentials, like
1/11

many other banking trojans, the malware has been repurposed for deploying other malware
on the infected machines.
One way IcedID infects machines is via phishing emails. The infection chain that commonly
has been used is an email with an attached password protected “zip” archive. Inside the
archive is a macro enabled office document that executes the IcedID installer. Some
phishing emails reuse previously stolen emails to make the lure more convincing.
In the new IcedID campaign we have discovered a further evolution of the threat
actors’ technique. The threat actor now uses compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to
send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from. The payload has also
moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file
and a DLL file. The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web
controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user. With regards to
targeting, we have seen organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and
pharmaceutical sectors.

Infection Chain

The attack-chain starts with a phishing email. The email includes a message about some
important document and has a password protected “zip” archive file attached. The
password to the archive is given in the email body, as can be seen in the screenshot below.
What makes the phishing email more convincing is that it’s using conversation hijacking
(thread hijacking). A forged reply to a previous stolen email is being used. Additionally,
the email has also been sent from the email account from whom the email was stolen from.

2/11

The content of the zip archive is shown in the screenshot below. It includes a single “ISO”
file with the same filename as the zip archive. It can also be seen that the file was created
not that long before the email was sent.

The ISO file includes two files, a LNK file named “document” and a DLL file named “main.”
From the timestamps it can be concluded that the DLL file was prepared the day before
while the LNK file was prepared about a week before. It is possible that the LNK file has
been used in earlier phishing emails.

The LNK file has been made to look like a document file via its embedded icon file. As can
be seen in the screenshot below, when a user double clicks the link file, it uses “regsvr32”
to execute the DLL file.

3/11

The use of regsvr32 allows for proxy execution of malicious code in main.dll for defense
evasion. The DLL file is a loader for the IcedID payload. It contains a number of exports,
most of which consist of junk code.

4/11

The loader will locate the encrypted payload, stored in the resource section of the binary. It
does this through the technique API hashing. A decompilation of the simple hashing
function is shown below.

The resulting hash is then compared with a hardcoded hash, locating the call for
FindResourceA. The function is dynamically called to fetch the payload.

5/11

Memory is allocated using VirtualAlloc to hold the decrypted payload.

6/11

The IcedID “Gziploader” payload is decoded and placed in memory and then executed.
GZiploader fingerprints the machine and sends a beacon to the command and control
server with information about the infected host. The information is smuggled through the
cookies header via an HTTP GET request.

The C2 is located at yourgroceries[.]top. The C2 can respond with a further stage to be
dropped and executed. The C2 did not respond with a payload during our analysis.

Conversation Hijacking as a Phishing Technique
7/11

The technique of hijacking an already existing conversation over email to spread malware is
something threat actors have been using for a while. Normally email messages are stolen
during an infection and used in future attacks to make the phishing email appear more
legitimate. In the last six months, threat actors have evolved the technique further to make it
even more convincing. Instead of sending the stolen conversation to the victim with a
“spoofed” email address, threat actors are now using the email address of the victim that
they stole the original email from to make the phishing email even more convincing.
Kevin Beaumont reported on this conversation hijacking technique back in November 2021
being used to distribute Qakbot. Through the investigation, he confirmed that the Microsoft
Exchange servers where the emails originated from had evidence of being exploited by
ProxyShell.

New Campaign Discovered in March 2022
In the current mid-March campaign, we have discovered reuse of the same stolen
conversation now being sent from the email address that received the latest email. Back in
January when this conversation was also used, the “FROM” address was
“webmaster@[REDACTED].com” with the name of the recipient of the last email in the
conversation. By using this approach, the email appears more legitimate and is transported
through the normal channels which can also include security products.
The majority of the originating Exchange servers we have observed appear to also be
unpatched and publicly exposed, making the ProxyShell vector a good theory. While the
majority of the Exchange servers used to send the phishing emails can be accessed by
anyone over the Internet, we have also seen a phishing email sent internally on what
appears to be an “internal” Exchange server.
The code snippet below shows a small part of the email header. The IP address of the
Exchange server is a local IP address (172.29.0.12) with a top-level domain name of “local”.
We can also see a header added by Exchange marking it as an internal email. The
exchange server also has added a header of the original client (172.29.5.131 which also is
a local IP address) that connected to the Exchange server over MAPI.

We didn’t manage to find a corresponding public IP address for this Exchange server and it
is not known to us how it was accessed by the threat actor. The only thing we managed to
find was a roundcube webmail instance. The login page is shown in the screenshot below.

One of the headers in the snippet above reported that the client connected to the server via
MAPI. MAPI is a protocol used (for example, by Outlook) to access the mailbox on an
Exchange server. This suggests that the threat actor used an Exchange client instead of
using SMTP to send the email. We have also seen the header “X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook
16.0” in multiple phishing emails. In other phishing emails a “X-Originating-IP” header can
be found. This is a header added by the Exchange server when the web interface is used.
The IP address in the header is that of the client that connected to the server. We have
observed both hosting providers and non-commercial IP addresses for the client IP.

In June 2021, Proofpoint released a report on different access brokers that facilitates
access for ransomware groups. Of the different threat actors, according to Proofpoint, two
of them (TA577 and TA551) used IcedID as their malware. The techniques used by TA551
include conversation hijacking and password protected zip files. The group is also known to
use regsvr32.exe for signed binary proxy execution for malicious DLLs.

Summary
The use of conversation hijacking is a powerful social engineering technique that can
increase the rate of a successful phishing attempt. The payload has been moved away from
office documents to the use of ISO files, employing the use of commodity packers and
multiple stages to hide activity. It is important to be able to detect malicious files in memory
to detect this type of attack. We recommend you use an endpoint scanner.
