NOTEWORTHY CHANGES TO NECURS’ BEHAVIORSEditPreview Text
Six years after it was first spotted in the wild, the Necurs malware botnet is still out to prove
that it’s a malware chameleon. We recently discovered noteworthy changes to the way
Necurs makes use of its bots, such as pushing infostealers on them and showing a special
interest in bots with specific characteristics. These behavioral changes could potentially
create a big impact as Necurs has been used in large-scale cybercriminal deployments in the
past.

As a modularized malware, Necurs can run any module on its network of bots. In 2017, we
saw Necurs pushing spamming and proxy modules onto its bots. This year, however, there’s
a notable decrease on Necurs’ spam volume compared to its spam campaigns in the last
quarter of 2017. Instead, we see Necurs pushing cryptocurrency miners and infostealers —
FlawedAmmyy RAT, AZORult, and a .NET module — as modules onto its bots.
Necurs pushes XMRig to its bots to mine Monero
In March, we saw Necurs pushing a Monero Miner — XMRig — to its bots. At the time we
checked it, the wallet owner was able to earn around $USD 1,200.00 in 24 hours.

Figure 1. A screen capture showing the wallet owner's earnings using the XMRig to mine
Monero. The user in the configuration of this XMRig module is

xiKsCdZ6auDmCC3mAQLpBxP2nhpGuHA27tToNeZM98Tz
FKe6vjCajdHdCz67iRB.worker” .
In April, we observed that it pushed the remote access trojan FlawedAmmyy onto its bots.
FlawedAmmyy is trojanized from a legitimate remote access tool Ammyy Admin. Like the
remote desktop tool, FlawedAmmyy has the functionalities of Ammyy Admin, including
remote desktop control, file system management, proxy support and audio chat capabilities.
Necurs pushes different modules via C&C commands. These modules check the bots if they
qualify for any of the following criteria:
1. Bots that are with crypto wallets.[1] The Necurs modules check if the machines have
files that contain any of the following strings that exist under “%APPDATA%” such as:
WALLET.DAT
BITCOIN-QT
ELECTRUM
COINBASE
MULTIBITHD
WALLET.AES
LITECOIN
MONERO
BITCOINCORE
2. Bots that are under or able to reach bank-related domains.[2] The modules execute
commands such as “net view” and “net user” to check for the following strings:
BANQ
BANK
BANC
SWIFT
2/6

BITCOIN
WESTERNUNION
MONEYGRAM
CARD
3. Bots that are running in a network with more than 100 employees or users.[3] The
modules execute “net user” and “net domain” to see if a machine is connected to a network
with more than 100 users.
4. Bots that run POS-related processes.[4]
5. Bots that are logged in using an email address on a hardcoded list.[5] The modules,
which contain some hardcoded lists, will check whether the email accounts associated with a
machine is on the list. We will detail this part in the section “Necurs Pushes Modules for
Email Extraction” below.
If the bots qualify based on the criteria listed above, the modules will install the
FlawedAmmyy RAT onto its bots. After the session initializes, the FlawedAmmyy RAT on the
infected bots steals and sends back the information, which includes:
id
os
priv (privilege)
cred (DOMAIN\username)
pcname (Computer name)
avname (Antivirus name)
build_time (Malware build time)
card (whether smart-card is connected or not)
Figure 2. The information sent back by FlawedAmmyy RAT.
Necurs pushes modules for email extraction
In late May, we saw some Necurs modules that exfiltrated email accounts and sent them to
hxxp://185[.]176[.]221[.]24/l/s[.]php. If someone installs and logs in to Outlook, Outlook
creates a directory “%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook\” wherein it will store
credentials with an email string in the filename (Figure 3). The module will search for the files
with email strings in the filenames and send those strings back.

filename

After just a few days, we saw four new modules that also dropped FlawedAmmyy RATs but
with a distinct feature — they contained hardcoded email lists inside. The four modules
checked if the email addresses on the bots were in any of the lists — the same manner in
which they were able to extract the email addresses that make up the lists — and if so,
dropped the FlawedAmmyy RATs.
After checking the hardcoded email lists, we discovered that it’s possible that the threat
actors used keyword matching to pick up email addresses that interest them.
Figure 4. A list of email addresses that feature notable similarities. Aside from bank-related
email addresses, some of the email addresses on the list seem to belong to government
institutions.
After further analysis, we extracted the different keywords used in the email address lists.
Based on the keywords, threat actors appear to show interest in governments, financial
institutions, tourism and food industries, and real estate companies.

Figure 5. Keywords extracted from the email address lists in the four Necurs modules.
A possible change in spamming tactics
Another notable action of Necurs is the possible change in its spamming tactics.
On June 11, 2018, we saw Necurs push a .NET spamming module that is capable of sending
emails and stealing credentials from Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox. Some parts of
this .NET spamming module overlap with an open-source remote access tool.
Figure 6. The Firefox StealerModule in the .NET spamming module on the left-hand side
has overlaps with QuasarRAT on the right-hand side.
When Necurs drops the .NET spamming module onto its bots, it gives the arguments that the
bots should execute the binary. The following is a screen capture of the command we
received from Necurs’ C&Cs:

Figure 7. A .NET module command screen capture.
The .NET spamming module (sha1: c25fcdf464202ef4226d085b8e495f4e5064125e)
performs different actions according to the arguments given (“args” in Figure 7). The
following are some arguments it accepts:
“-sendcorp”: send the emails via victims’ Outlook
“-sendprivate”: send emails via victims’ Gmail and Yahoo
“-subject”: the subject for the email
4/6

“-attach”: the attachment for the email in base64 format
“-name”: the “FROM” address for the email
“-body”: the body for the email in base64 format
“-demo”: send a copy to the given email address
The mail sent with the arguments in Figure 7 will be as follows:

Figure 8. The email sent by .NET spamming module with the arguments in Figure 7.
The following are some of the .NET module’s noteworthy features: it can send spam using
the logged-in email accounts on a victim’s machine, and it can access a victim’s contact list
stored in email clients and the email addresses with which a victim has previously
corresponded. The victims will not be able to notice the spam being sent from their email
addresses as the .NET module can delete the last email sent from the victim’s email account
and catch all alerts.
In the past, Necurs sent spam to its victims directly via its bots, which allowed blacklisting bot
IPs to block them. However, if the spam emails are sent via legitimate email clients with
whitelisted IPs, the IP-blocking solution might not work properly. Moreover, those spam
emails are from email accounts that the receivers already recognize. Although this technique
is not new — some malware campaigns such as EMOTET and Ursnif/Dreambot have
already adopted this kind of spamming technique — this is a new technique for Necurs.
With the “demo” argument set, we believe that this module is a test run for possible future
campaigns and a way for the malware author to demonstrate the .NET module’s capabilities
to possible customers.
