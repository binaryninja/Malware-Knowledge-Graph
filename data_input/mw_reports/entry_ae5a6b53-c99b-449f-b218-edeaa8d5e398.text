Pharmaceutical
Construction

After detailed research, it was determined that the largest number of victims we identified fall
into the industrial/machinery building sector, which is a good indication that this is a sector of

The Crouching Yeti threat relayed on three methods to infect the victims, Spear-phishing emails using PDF documents embedded with an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2011-0611)
Trojanized software installers
Waterhole attacks using a variety of re-used exploits

Threat Details
Crouching Yeti is hardly a sophisticated campaign. For example, the attackers used no zeroday exploits, only exploits that are widely available on the Internet. But that didn’t prevent the
campaign from staying under the radar for several years.
The total number of known victims is over 2800 worldwide, out of which Kaspersky Lab
researchers were able to identify 101 organizations. This list of victims seems to indicate
Crouching Yeti’s interest in strategic targets, but it also shows an interest of the group in
many other not-so-obvious institutions.
Kaspersky Lab’s experts believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be
reasonable to redefine Crouching Yeti not only as a highly targeted campaign in a very
specific area of interest, but also as a broad surveillance campaign with interests in different
sectors.

How can I protect myself against Crouching Yeti

2/3

were zero day exploit attacks, the majority of the infections could have been prevented
by using up-to-date third party software.

Education is an important part of security, especially regarding the spear phishing
emails.
