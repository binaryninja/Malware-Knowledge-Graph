Targeted attacks
PhantomLance: hiding in plain sight
In April, we reported the results of our investigation into a mobile spyware campaign that we
call ‘PhantomLance’. The campaign involved a backdoor Trojan that the attackers distributed
via dozens of apps in Google Play and elsewhere.

1/21

Dr Web first reported the malware in July 2019, but we decided to investigate because the
Trojan was more sophisticated than most malware for stealing money or displaying ads. The
spyware is able to gather geo-location data, call logs and contacts; and can monitor SMS
activity. The malware can also collect information about the device and the apps installed on
it.
The earliest registered PhantomLance domain we found dates back to December 2015. We
found dozens of related samples that had been appearing in the wild since 2016 and one of
the latest samples was published in November last year. We informed Google about the
malware, and Google removed it soon after. We observed around 300 attacks targeting
specific Android devices, mainly in Southeast Asia.

2/21

During our investigation, we discovered various overlaps with reported OceanLotus APT
campaigns, including code similarities with a previous Android campaign, as well as macOS
backdoors, infrastructure overlaps with Windows backdoors and a few cross-platform
characteristics.

Naikon’s Aria
The Naikon APT is a well-established threat actor in the APAC region. Kaspersky first
reported and then fully described the group in 2015. Even when the group shut down much
of its successful offensive activity, Naikon maintained several splinter campaigns.
Researchers at Check Point recently published their write-up on Naikon resources and
activities related to “Aria-Body”, which we detected in 2017 and reported in 2018. To
supplement their research findings, we published a summary of our June 2018 report,
“Naikon’s New AR Backdoor Deployment to Southeast Asia“, which aligns with the Check
Point report.
AR is a set of backdoors with compilation dates between January 2017 and February 2018.
Much of this code operates in memory, injected by other loader components without touching
disk, making it very difficult to detect. We trace portions of this codebase back to
“xsFunction” EXE and DLL modules used in Naikon operations going back to 2012. It’s
probably that the new backdoor, and related activity, is an extension of, or a merger with, the
group’s “Paradir Operation”. In the past, the group targeted communications and sensitive
information from executive and legislative offices, law enforcement, government

3/21

administrative, military and intelligence organizations within Southeast Asia. In many cases
we have seen that these systems also were targeted previously with PlugX and other
malware.
The group has evolved since 2015, although it continues to focus on the same targets. We
identified at least a half a dozen individual variants from 2017 and 2018.

COMpfun authors spoof visa application with HTTP status-based Trojan
Last October, we observed malware that we call Reductor, with strong code similarities to
COMpfun, which infected files on the fly to compromise TLS traffic. The attackers behind
Reductor have continued to develop their code. More recently, the Kaspersky Threat
Attribution Engine revealed a new Trojan with strong code similarities to COMpfun.
The new malware, like its predecessor, targeted diplomatic bodies in Europe. To lure their
victims, the attackers used spoofed visa applications that contain malware that acts as a
first-stage dropper. This in turn downloads the main payload, which logs the target’s location,
gathers host- and network-related data, performs keylogging and takes screenshots. The
Trojan also monitors USB devices and can infect them in order to spread further, and
receives commands from the C2 server in the form of HTTP status codes.

4/21

It’s not entirely clear which threat actor is behind COMpfun. However, based mostly on the
victims targeted by the malware, we associate it, with medium-to-low confidence, with the
Turla APT.

Mind the [air] gap
In June, we published our report on the latest tools and TTPs (Tactics Techniques and
Procedures) of Cycldek (aka Goblin Panda, APT 27 and Conimes), a threat actor that has
targeted governments in Southeast Asia since 2013.

Most of the attacks we have seen since 2018 start with phishing emails that contain
politically themed, booby-trapped RTF documents that exploit known vulnerabilities. Once
the target computer has been compromised, the attackers install malware called NewCore
RAT. There are two variants. The first, BlueCore, appears to have been deployed against
diplomatic and government targets in Vietnam; while the second, RedCore, was first
deployed in Vietnam before being found in Laos.
Bot variants download additional tools, including a custom backdoor, a tool for stealing
cookies and a tool that steals passwords from Chromium-based browser databases. The
most striking of these tools is USBCulprit, which relies on USB media to exfiltrate data from
victims’ computers. This may suggest that Cycldek is trying to reach air-gapped networks in
compromised environments or relies on a physical presence for the same purpose. The
malware is implanted as a side-loaded DLL of legitimate, signed applications.

Looking at big threats using code similarity

5/21

In June, we announced the release of KTAE (Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine). KTAE
was initially developed as an internal threat hunting tool by the Global Research and
Analysis Team at Kaspersky and was instrumental in our investigations into the LightSpy,
TajMahal, Dtrack, ShadowHammer and ShadowPad campaigns.
Here’s how it works in a nutshell. We extract from a suspicious file something that we call
‘genotypes’ – short fragments of code selected using our proprietary algorithm – and
compare it with more than 60,000 objects of targeted attacks from our database, using a
wide range of characteristics. Based on the code similarities, KTAE calculates a reputational
score and highlights the possible origin and author, with a short description and links to both
private and public resources, outlining the previous campaigns.

Subscribers to our APT intelligence reports can see a dedicated report on the TTPs used by
the identified threat actor, as well as further response steps.
KTAE is designed to be deployed on a customer’s network, with updates provided via USB,
to ensure confidentiality. In addition to the threat intelligence available ‘out of the box’,
customers can create their own database and fill it with malware samples found by in-house
analysts. In this way, KTAE will learn to attribute malware analogous to those in the
customer’s database while keeping this information confidential. There’s also an API
(application programming interface) to connect the engine to other systems, including a thirdparty SOC (security operations center).
Code similarity can only provide pointers; and attackers can set false flags that can trick
even the most advanced threat hunting tools – the ‘attribution hell’ surrounding Olympic
Destroyer provided an object lesson in how this can happen. The purpose of tools such as

6/21

KTAE is to point experts in the right direction and to test likely scenarios.
You can find out more about the development of KTAE in this post by Costin Raiu, Director of
the Global Research and Analysis Team and this product demonstration.

SixLittleMonkeys
Earlier this year, we observed a Trojan injected into the spooler system process memory of a
computer belonging to a diplomatic body. The malware is implemented like an API using an
enterprise-grade programming style – something that is quite rare and is mostly used by
advanced threat actors. We attribute this campaign to a threat actor called SixLittleMonkeys
(aka Microcin) because of the re-use of C2 infrastructure, code similarities and focus on
diplomatic targets in Central Asia.

This threat actor uses steganography to deliver malicious modules and configuration data
from a legitimate public resource, in this case from the legitimate public image hosting
service cloudinary.com:

Other malware
Loncom packer: from backdoors to Cobalt Strike
In March, we reported the distribution of Mokes and Buerak malware under the guise of a
security certificate update. Following publication of that report, we conducted a detailed
analysis of the malware associated with this campaign. All of the malware uses legitimate
NSIS software for packing and loading shellcode, and the Microsoft Crypto API for
decrypting the final payload.
Besides Mokes and Buerak, which we mentioned in the previous article, we noticed packed
specimens of DarkVNC and Sodin (aka REvil and Sodinokibi). The former is a backdoor
used to control an infected machine via the VNC protocol; the latter is a ransomware family.
However, the most striking find was the Cobalt Strike utility, which is used both by legal pentesters and by various APT groups. The command center of the sample that contained
Cobalt Strike had previously been seen distributing CactusTorch, a utility for running
shellcode present in Cobalt Strike modules, and the same Cobalt Strike packed with a
different packer.

xHelper: the Trojan matryoshka

9/21

The xHelper Trojan remains as active as ever. The most notable feature of this Trojan is its
persistence on an Android device: once it gets onto a phone, it’s able to survive even if it’s
deleted or the device is restored to factory settings.
The architecture of the latest version resembles a Russian nesting doll (or ‘matryoshka’). The
infection starts by tricking a victim into downloading a fake app – in the case of the version
we analyzed, an app that masquerades as a popular cleaner and speed-up utility. Following
installation, it is listed as an installed app in the system settings, but otherwise disappears
from the victim’s view – there’s no icon and it doesn’t show up in search results. The
payload, which is decrypted in the background, fingerprints the victim’s phone and sends the
data to a remote server. It then unpacks a dropper-within-a-dropper-within-a-dropper (hence
the matryoshka analogy). The malicious files are stored sequentially in the app’s data folder,
to which other programs do not have access. This mechanism allows the malware authors to
obscure the trail and use malicious modules that are known to security solutions.
The final downloader in the sequence, called Leech, is responsible for installing the Triada
Trojan, whose chief feature is a set of exploits for obtaining root privileges on the victim’s
device. This allows the Trojan to install malicious files directly in the system partition.
Normally this is mounted at system startup and is read-only. However, once the Trojan has
obtained root access, it remounts the system partition in write mode and modifies the system
such that the user is unable to remove the malicious files, even after a factory reset.
Simply deleting xHelper isn’t enough to clean the device. If you have ‘recovery’ mode set up
on the device, you can try to extract the ‘libc.so’ file from the original firmware and replace
the infected one with it, before removing all malware from the system partition. However, it’s
simpler and more reliable to completely re-flash the phone. If the firmware of the device
contains pre-installed malware capable of downloading and installing programs, even reflashing will be pointless. In that case, it’s worth considering an alternative firmware for the
device.

Spike in RDP brute-force attacks
The huge increase in remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct
impact on cybersecurity and the threat landscape. Alongside the higher volume of corporate
traffic, the use of third-party services for data exchange and employees working on home
computers (, IT security teams also have to grapple with the increased use of remote access
tools, including the Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
RDP, used to connect remotely to someone else’s desktop, is used by telecommuters and IT
support staff to troubleshoot problems. A successful RDP attack provides a cybercriminal
with remote access to the target computer with the same permissions enjoyed by the person
whose computer it is.

10/21

In the two months prior to our report (i.e. March and April), we observed a huge increase in
attempts to brute-force passwords for RDP accounts. The numbers rose from 100,000 to
150,000 per day in January and February to nearly a million per day at the beginning of
March.

Since attacks on remote infrastructure will undoubtedly continue, it’s important for anyone
using RDP to protect their systems. This includes the following.
Use strong passwords.
Make RDP available only through a corporate VPN.
Use NLA (Network Level Authentication).
Enable two-factor authentication.
If you don’t use RDP, disable it and close port 3389.
Use a reliable security solution.
Even if you use a different remote access protocol, you shouldn’t relax. At the end of last
year, Kaspersky experts found 37 vulnerabilities in various clients that connected via the
VNC protocol, which, like RDP, is used for remote access.

Gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic
Online gamers face various threats, including malware in pirated copies, mods and cheats,
phishing and other scams when buying or exchanging in-game items and dangers
associated with buying accounts.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a marked increase in player activity. For one thing, the
sales of games have increased:

The amount of time spent playing has also increased:

This hasn’t gone unnoticed by cybercriminals. With the connection of work computers to
home networks, and, conversely, the entry of home devices into work networks that are often
poorly prepared for this, attacks on players are becoming not only a way to get to an
individual user’s wallet but also a way to access the corporate infrastructure. Cybercriminals
are actively hunting for vulnerabilities that they can exploit to compromise systems. For
example, in the first five months of this year alone, the number of vulnerabilities discovered
on Steam exceeded those discovered in any of the previous years.

scams:

Rovnix bootkit back in business
In mid-April, our threat monitoring systems detected an attempt by cybercriminals to exploit
the COVID-19 pandemic to distribute the Rovnix bootkit. The infected file, which has an EXE
or RAR extension, is called (in Russian) ‘on the new initiative of the World Bank in
connection with the coronavirus pandemic’. The file is a self-extracting archive that contains
‘easymule.exe’ and ‘1211.doc’.

17/21

The file includes the Rovnix bootkit.
Rovnix is well-known and the source code published some time ago. And there’s nothing
new about cybercriminals exploiting the current pandemic to distribute malware. However,
Rovnix has been updated with a UAC (User Account Control) bypass tool, allowing the
malware to escalate its privileges without displaying a UAC request. It also uses DLL
hijacking to camouflage itself in the system.
This version also delivers a loader that is unusual for this malware. Once the malware is
installed, the C2 can send commands to control the infected computer, including recording
sound from the microphone and sending the audio file to the cybercriminals, turning off or
restarting the computer.
Our analysis of this version makes it clear that even well-known threats like Rovnix can throw
up surprises when the source code goes public. Freed from the need to develop their own
protection-bypassing tools from scratch, cybercriminals can pay more attention to the
capabilities of their own malware and add their own ‘goodies’ to the source code – in this
case, UAC bypass.

Web skimming with Google Analytics
Web skimming is a common method of stealing the data of online shoppers. Cybercriminals
inject malicious code into a target website to harvest the data entered by consumers. They
gain access to the compromised site by brute-forcing an administrator account password,
exploiting vulnerabilities in the CMS (content management system) or one of its third-party
plugins, or by injecting malicious code into an incorrectly coded input form.
18/21

One way to prevent this is to try to block the exfiltration of the harvested data using a
Content Security Policy (CSP) – a technical header that lists all services with the right to
collect information on a particular site or page. If the service used by the cybercriminals is
not listed in the header, they will not be able to withdraw any information they harvest.
Some attackers are using Google Analytics to work around this. Most online providers today
carefully monitor visitor statistics; and the most convenient tool for doing this is Google
Analytics. The service, which allows data collection based on many parameters, is currently
used by around 29 million sites. So, there’s a strong likelihood that data transfer to Google
Analytics is allowed in the CSP header of an online store. To collect website statistics, all you
have to do is configure tracking parameters and add a tracking code to your pages. As far as
the service is concerned, if you are able to add this code, you are the legitimate owner of the
site. So, the malicious script injected by the attacker can collect user data and then, using
their own tracking code, send it through the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol directly
to their account.
To prevent these issues, webmasters should do the following:
Adopt a strict CMS access policy that restricts user rights to a minimum.
Install CMS components from trusted sources only.
Create strong passwords for all administrator accounts.
Apply updates to all software.
Filter user-entered data and query parameters, to prevent third-party code injection.
For e-commerce sites, use PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways.
Consumers should use a reliable security solution – one that detects malicious scripts on
payment sites.

The Magnitude Exploit Kit
Exploit kits are not as widespread as they used to be. In the past, they sought to exploit
vulnerabilities that had already been patched. However, newer and more secure web
browsers with automatic updates simply prevent this. The decline in the use of Adobe Flash
Player has also reduced the opportunities for cybercriminals. Adobe Flash Player is a
browser plug-in: so even if the browser was up-to-date, there was a possibility that Adobe
Flash was still vulnerable to known exploits. The end of life date for Adobe Flash is fast
approaching. It is disabled by default in all web browsers and has pretty much been replaced
with open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly.
Nevertheless, exploit kits have not disappeared completely. They have adapted and
switched to target people running Internet Explorer that haven’t installed the latest security
updates.
19/21

Although Edge replaced Internet Explorer as the default web browser with the release of
Windows 10, Internet Explorer is still installed for backward compatibility on machines
running Windows 10; and has remained the default web browser for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.
The switch to Microsoft Edge development also meant that Internet Explorer would no longer
be actively developed and would only receive vulnerability patches without general security
improvements. Notwithstanding this, Internet Explorer remains a relatively popular web
browser. According to NetMarketShare, as of April 2020, Internet Explorer is used on 5.45%
of desktop computers (for comparison, Firefox accounts for 7.25%, Safari 3.94% and Edge
7.76%).
Despite the security of Internet Explorer being five years behind that of its modern
counterparts, it supports a number of legacy script engines. CVE-2018-8174 is a vulnerability
in a legacy VBScript engine that was originally discovered in the wild as an exploited zeroday. The majority of exploit kits quickly adopted it as their primary exploit. Since its discovery,
a few more vulnerabilities for Internet Explorer have been discovered as in-the-wild zerodays – CVE-2018-8653, CVE-2019-1367, CVE-2019-1429 and CVE-2020-0674. All of them
exploited another legacy component of Internet Explorer – a JScript engine. It felt like it was
just a matter of time until exploit kits adopted these new exploits.
Exploit kits still play a role in today’s threat landscape and continue to evolve. We recently
analyzed the evolution of one of the most sophisticated exploit kits out there – the Magnitude
Exploit Kit – for a whole year. We discovered that this exploit kit continues to deliver
ransomware to Asia Pacific (APAC) countries via malvertising. Study of the exploit kit’s
activity over a period of 12 months showed that the Magnitude Exploit Kit is actively
maintained and undergoes continuous development. In February this year, the exploit kit
switched to an exploit for the most recent vulnerability in Internet Explorer – CVE-2019-1367
– originally discovered as an exploited zero-day in the wild. Magnitude Exploit Kit also uses a
previously unknown elevation of privilege exploit for CVE-2018-8641, developed by a prolific
exploit writer.
You can read more about our findings here.
While the total volume of attacks performed using exploit kits has decreased, it’s clear that
they still exist, remain active, and continue to pose a threat. Magnitude is not the only active
exploit kit and we see other exploit kits that are also switching to newer exploits for Internet
Explorer. We recommend that people install security updates, migrate to a supported
operating system (and make sure you stay up-to-date with Windows 10 builds) and also
replace Internet Explorer as their web browser.
