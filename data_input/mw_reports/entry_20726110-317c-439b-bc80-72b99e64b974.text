A state-backed Chinese APT actor tracked as 'Antlion' has been using a new custom
backdoor called 'xPack' against financial organizations and manufacturing companies.
The malware has been used in a campaign against targets in Taiwan that researchers
believe spanned for more than 18 months, between 2020 and 2021, allowing the
adversaries to run stealthy cyber-espionage operations.
According to a report from Symantec, a Broadcom company, shared with
BleepingComputer, xPack enabled attackers to run WMI commands remotely, to leverage
EternalBlue exploits, and mounted shares over SMB to deliver data to the command and
control (C2) server.

In the network for 250 days
Details from one attack show that the threat actor spent 175 days on the compromised
network. However, Symantec researchers analyzing two other attacks determined that the
the adversary went undetected on the network for as long as 250 days.
Using custom malware unknown to threat analysts played a key role in achieving this level
of stealthiness.
xPack is a .NET loader that fetches and executes AES-encrypted payloads, while it's also
capable to execute system commands and stage data for exfiltration.
Symantec also spotted the following custom tools that accompanied xPack in this
camapaign:

EHAGBPSL – Custom C++ loader
JpgRun – Custom C++ loader
CheckID – Custom C++ loader based on a similar tool used by the BlackHole RAT
NetSessionEnum – Custom SMB session enumeration tool
ENCODE MMC – Custom bind/reverse file transfer tool
Kerberos golden ticket tool based on the Mimikatz credentials stealer
Antlion also used various off-the-shelf and living-off-the-land (LoL) tools in combination with
the above to achieve full operational capability without raising security flags.
Tools such as PowerShell, WMIC, ProcDump, LSASS, and PsExec were common in this
campaign, leaving crumbs of evidence that easily blend with ordinary operating
system functions.
Finally, the actors were also observed leveraging CVE-2019-1458 for privilege escalation
and remote scheduling that helped execute the backdoor.
This vulnerability was recently included on CISA's list of actively exploited flaws, so it's still
an attractive avenue for multiple adversaries.
"There is also evidence that the attackers likely automated the data collection process via
batch scripts, while there is also evidence of instances where data was likely staged for
further exfiltration, though it was not actually observed being exfiltrated from the network,"
explains Symantec
"In these instances, it appears the attackers were interested in collecting information from
software pertaining to business contacts, investments, and smart card readers."
In the attacks dissected by Symantec's analysts, xPack was initially used to collect basic
system information and running processes, and then for dumping credentials.
Afterwards, the actors returned periodically and launched xPack again to steal account
credentials from several machines in the compromised organizations.

Antlion still active and dangerous
Antlion is believed to be involved in cyber-espionage activities since at least 2011, so this is
an actor that has remained a threat to organizations for over a decade now.
Its interest in targeting Taiwanese firms has political extensions and is in line with the
operational strategy of most Chinese state-sponsored groups.
As detailed in Symantec's report, the particular campaign focused on dumping credentials
from the compromised systems and then using them to move laterally.

3/5

It's possible that Antlion shared these credentials with other Chinese hacker groups that
had a different operational focus, as it is common for actors working for the same state to
collaborate.
