Satan ransomware rebrands as 5ss5c ransomware
bartblaze.blogspot.com/2020/01/satan-ransomware-rebrands-as-5ss5c.html

The cybercrime group that brought us Satan, DBGer and Lucky ransomware and perhaps
Iron ransomware, has now come up with a new version or rebranding named "5ss5c".
In a previous blog post, Satan ransomware adds EternalBlue exploit, I described how the
group behind Satan ransomware has been actively developing its ransomware, adding new
functionalities (specifically then: EternalBlue) and techniques with each run. Then, it
appeared the group halted operations on at least the ransomware front for several months.
However, as it turns out, the group has been working on new ransomware - 5ss5c - since at
least November 2019.
The following tweet got my attention:

🧐Unknown #Ransomware captured tonight from #China, Encrypt only compressed
files.
Email：5ss5c@mail.ru
ext：.5ss5c

After some quick checks, it appears this is a downloader for the 5ss5c ransomware, which is
extremely reminiscent of how Satan ransomware operated:

Figure 1 - 5ss5c downloader
The malware will leverage certutil and even contains logging:

Figure 2 - certutil logging
It will download and leverage:
Spreader (EternalBlue and hardcoded credentials);
Mimikatz and what appears another password dumper/stealer;
The actual ransomware.

The following hashes are relevant to this new variant:

down.txt is, as mentioned, the downloader for the spreader module and for the actual
ransomware:

Purpose: spreader

VirusTotal report:

Fun fact: file version information contains "TODO: 5SS5C Encoder".
The compilation times are sequential, which makes sense - the downloader has been
developed (and compiled) first, then the spreader and the actual ransomware.
Note that cpt.exe as filename has already been observed in Satan ransomware.
Further indicators, such as hashes, URLs, file paths and so on will be posted at the end of
this blog post.

5ss5c - still in development - and with oddities
There's quite some curiosities that indicate 5ss5c is still in active development and stems
from Satan ransomware, for example:
There are several logs created, e.g. there is a file "C:\Program Files\Common
Files\System\Scanlog" that simply logs whether IPC SMB is open/available;
Certutil logging (successful download or not);
There are several Satan ransomware artefacts;
Other Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) align with both Satan (and DBGer),
and slightly overlap with Iron:
3/10

One of these is, for example, the use of multiple packers to protect their droppers
and payloads.
This time however, they decided to use both MPRESS and Enigma, and even
Enigma VirtualBox! (Note: Enigma and Enigma VirtualBox are not the same - the
latter is a virtualised packer and also referred to as EnigmaVM.)

However, there are quite some curiosities, one of them being what appear to be hardcoded
credentials:

Figure 3 - Hardcoded creds
These hardcoded credentials will be leveraged in an attempt to connect to an SQL database
with the xp_cmdshell command:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xpcmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
Curiously, we can identify the following data inside the ransomware in regards to the SQL
database:
ecology.url
ecology.password
ecology.user
Searching a bit further, we can discover a company named Finereport
(https://www.finereport.com/en/company), which claims to be "Top 1 in China’s BI market
share in IDC "China BI Software Tracker, 2018". You guessed it - it uses SQL as database.
4/10

What else is new is, as mentioned before, the use of Enigma VirtualBox for packing an
additional spreader module, aptly named poc.exe. This suggest they may be experimenting
(poc often is an acronym for proof of concept).
This file will be dropped to C:\ProgramData\poc.exe and will run the following command:
cd /D C:\ProgramData&star.exe --OutConfig a --TargetPort 445 --Protocol SMB -Architecture x64 --Function RunDLL --DllPayload C:\ProgramData\down64.dll -TargetIp
Now compare this to Satan ransomware's command:
cmd /c cd /D C:\Users\Alluse~1\&blue.exe --TargetIp & star.exe --OutConfig a -TargetPort 445 --Protocol SMB --Architecture x64 --Function RunDLL --DllPayload
down64.dll --TargetIp
Something looks similar here... :-)
5ss5c ransomware - how it operates

Back to the actual ransomware. It will create the following mutexes:
SSSS_Scan (in previous iterations SSS_Scan has also been observed)
5ss5c_CRYPT

Just like its predecessor, 5ss5c also has an exclusion list, where it will not encrypt specific
files as well as files in the following folders:

Figure 4 - Exclusion list
5/10

For example, the following folders belonging to Qihoo 360 (an internet security company
based in China also offering antivirus) were already excluded in Satan and DBGer
ransomware:
360rec
360sec
360sand
While these are new in 5ss5c ransomware:
360downloads
360safe
As in previous iterations, 5ss5c ransomware will stop database-related services and
processes.
It will however only encrypt files with the following extensions:
7z, bak, cer, csv, db, dbf, dmp, docx, eps, ldf, mdb, mdf, myd, myi, ora, pdf, pem, pfx,
ppt, pptx, psd, rar, rtf, sql, tar, txt, vdi, vmdk, vmx, xls, xlsx, zip
This extension list is not like before, and includes mostly documents, archives, database files
and VMware-related extensions such as vmdk.
The ransomware will then create the following URI structure to communicate with the C2
server (61.186.243[.]2):
/api/data.php?code=
&file=
&size=
&status=
&keyhash=
It will also create a ransomware note on the C:\ drive as: _如何解密我的文件_.txt which
translates to _How to decrypt my file_.txt. Example content is as follows:

6/10

Figure 5 - ransom note
The content reads:
部分文件已经被加密
如果你想找回加密文件,发送 (1) 个比特币到我的钱包
从加密开始48小时之内没有完成支付,解密的金额会发生翻倍.
如果有其他问题,可以通过邮件联系我
您的解密凭证是 :
Email:[5ss5c@mail.ru]

Translated:

Some files have been encrypted
If you want to retrieve the encrypted file, send (1) Bitcoins to my wallet
If payment is not completed within 48 hours from the start of encryption, the amount of
decryption will double.
If you have other questions, you can contact me by email
Your decryption credentials are:
Email: [5ss5c@mail.ru]

Interestingly, the ransomware note does not contain a Bitcoin address. Additionally, the note
only contains instructions in Chinese, not Korean nor English like previous iterations.
Is 5ss5c ransomware more targeted, or just actively being tested by the group/developers
behind it?

7/10

Encrypted files will have the actor's email address prepended and a unique token with the
ransomware's name will be appended, for example;
test.txt becomes
[5ss5c@mail.ru]test.txt.Y54GUHKIG1T2ZLN76II9F3BBQV7MK4UOGSQUND7U.5ss5c.
Prevention
Enable UAC;
Enable Windows Update, and install updates (especially verify if MS17-010 is
installed);
Install an antivirus, and keep it up-to-date and running;
Install a firewall, or enable the Windows Firewall;
Restrict, where possible, access to shares (ACLs);
Create backups! (and test them)
More ransomware prevention can be found here.
Conclusion
Satan is dead, long live 5ss5c! It just doesn't sound as good, does it?
Whoever's behind the development of Satan, DBGer, Lucky and likely Iron ransomware, is
back in business with the 5ss5c ransomware, and it appears to be in active development and is trying to increase (or perhaps focus?) its targeting and spread of the ransomware.
It is recommended organisations detect and/or search for the indicators of compromise
(IOCs) below, and have proper prevention controls in place. MITRE ATT&CK IDs can also be
