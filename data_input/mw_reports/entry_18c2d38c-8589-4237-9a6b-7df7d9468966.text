Fancy Bear (also known as APT28 (by Mandiant), Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group (by
Kaspersky), Sednit, Tsar Team (by FireEye) and STRONTIUM (by Microsoft))[2][4] is a
Russian cyber espionage group. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has said with a medium
level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU.[5]
[6] The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office[7] as well as security firms SecureWorks,[8]
ThreatConnect,[9] and Mandiant,[10] have also said the group is sponsored by the Russian
government. In 2018, an indictment by the United States Special Counsel identified Fancy
Bear as GRU Unit 26165.[3][2]
The name "Fancy Bear" comes from a coding system security researcher Dmitri Alperovitch
uses to identify hackers.[11]
1/24

Likely operating since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear's methods are consistent with the
capabilities of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security
organizations, especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to
be responsible for cyber attacks on the German parliament, the Norwegian parliament, the
French television station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, the Democratic National
Committee, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the campaign of
French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron.[12]
The group promotes the political interests of the Russian government, and is known for
hacking Democratic National Committee emails to attempt to influence the outcome of the
United States 2016 presidential elections.
Fancy Bear is classified by FireEye as an advanced persistent threat.[10] Among other things,
it uses zero-day exploits, spear phishing and malware to compromise targets.

Discovery and security reports
Trend Micro designated the actors behind the Sofacy malware as Operation Pawn Storm
on October 22, 2014.[13] The name was due to the group's use of "two or more connected
tools/tactics to attack a specific target similar to the chess strategy,"[14] known as pawn
storm.
Network security firm FireEye released a detailed report on Fancy Bear in October 2014. The
report designated the group as "Advanced Persistent Threat 28" (APT28) and described how
the hacking group used zero-day exploits of the Microsoft Windows operating system and
Adobe Flash.[15] The report found operational details indicating that the source is a
"government sponsor based in Moscow". Evidence collected by FireEye suggested that
Fancy Bear's malware was compiled primarily in a Russian-language build environment and
occurred mainly during work hours paralleling Moscow's time zone.[16] FireEye director of
threat intelligence Laura Galante referred to the group's activities as "state espionage"[17]
and said that targets also include "media or influencers."[18][19]
The name "Fancy Bear" derives from the coding system that Dmitri Alperovitch's company
CrowdStrike uses for hacker groups. "Bear" indicates that the hackers are from Russia.
"Fancy" refers to "Sofacy", a word in the malware that reminded the analyst who found it, of
Iggy Azalea's song "Fancy".[1]

Attacks
Fancy Bear's targets have included Eastern European governments and militaries, the
country of Georgia and the Caucasus, Ukraine,[20] security-related organizations such as
NATO, as well as US defense contractors Academi (formerly known as Blackwater and Xe
Services), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),[21] Boeing, Lockheed
Martin, and Raytheon.[20] Fancy Bear has also attacked citizens of the Russian Federation
2/24

that are political enemies of the Kremlin, including former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
and Maria Alekhina of the band Pussy Riot.[20] SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm
headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the
"Fancy Bear" target list included not merely the United States Democratic National
Committee, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States,
Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.
[22] An AP analysis of 4,700 email accounts that had been attacked by Fancy Bear concluded
that no country other than Russia would be interested in hacking so many very different
targets that seemed to have nothing else in common other than their being of interest to the
Russian government.[20]
Fancy Bear also seems to try to influence political events in order for friends or allies of the
Russian government to gain power.
In 2011–2012, Fancy Bear's first-stage malware was the "Sofacy" or SOURFACE implant.
During 2013, Fancy Bear added more tools and backdoors, including CHOPSTICK,
CORESHELL, JHUHUGIT, and ADVSTORESHELL.[23]

Attacks on prominent journalists in Russia, the United States, Ukraine,
Moldova, the Baltics, and elsewhere
From mid-2014 until the fall of 2017, Fancy Bear targeted numerous journalists in the United
States, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, the Baltics, and other countries who had written articles
about Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. According to the Associated Press and SecureWorks,
this group of journalists is the third largest group targeted by Fancy Bear after diplomatic
personnel and U.S. Democrats. Fancy Bear's targeted list includes Adrian Chen, the
Armenian journalist Maria Titizian, Eliot Higgins at Bellingcat, Ellen Barry and at least 50
other New York Times reporters, at least 50 foreign correspondents based in Moscow who
worked for independent news outlets, Josh Rogin, a Washington Post columnist, Shane
Harris, a Daily Beast writer who in 2015 covered intelligence issues, Michael Weiss, a CNN
security analyst, Jamie Kirchick with the Brookings Institution, 30 media targets in Ukraine,
many at the Kyiv Post, reporters who covered the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine,
as well as in Russia where the majority of journalists targeted by the hackers worked for
independent news (e.g. Novaya Gazeta or Vedomosti) such as Ekaterina Vinokurova at
Znak.com and mainstream Russian journalists Tina Kandelaki, Ksenia Sobchak, and the
Russian television anchor Pavel Lobkov, all of which worked for Dozhd.[24]

German attacks (from 2014)
Fancy Bear is thought to have been responsible for a six-month-long cyber-attack on the
German parliament that began in December 2014.[25] On 5 May 2020, German federal
prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Dimitri Badin in relation with the attacks.[26] The

3/24

attack completely paralyzed the Bundestag's IT infrastructure in May 2015. To resolve the
situation, the entire parliament had to be taken offline for days. IT experts estimate that a
total of 16 gigabytes of data were downloaded from Parliament as part of the attack.[27]
The group is also suspected to be behind a spear phishing attack in August 2016 on
members of the Bundestag and multiple political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra
Wagenknecht, Junge Union and the CDU of Saarland.[28][29][30][31] Authorities feared that
sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of
elections such as Germany's next federal election which was due in September 2017.[28]

U.S. military wives' death threats (February 10, 2015)
Five wives of U.S. military personnel received death threats from a hacker group calling itself
"CyberCaliphate", claiming to be an Islamic State affiliate, on February 10, 2015.[32][33][34][35]
This was later discovered to have been a false flag attack by Fancy Bear, when the victims'
email addresses were found to have been in the Fancy Bear phishing target list.[33] Russian
social media trolls have also been known to hype and rumor monger the threat of potential
Islamic State terror attacks on U.S. soil in order to sow fear and political tension.[33]

French television hack (April 2015)
On April 8, 2015, French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyber-attack by a
hacker group calling itself "CyberCaliphate" and claiming to have ties to the terrorist
organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). French investigators later discounted
the theory that militant Islamists were behind the cyber-attack, instead suspecting the
involvement of Fancy Bear.[36]
Hackers breached the network's internal systems, possibly aided by passwords openly
broadcast by TV5,[37] overriding the broadcast programming of the company's 12 channels
for over three hours.[38] Service was only partially restored in the early hours of the following
morning and normal broadcasting services were disrupted late into April 9.[38] Various
computerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still
shut down or otherwise inaccessible due to the attack.[39][38] The hackers also hijacked
TV5Monde's Facebook and Twitter pages to post the personal information of relatives of
French soldiers participating in actions against ISIS, along with messages critical of
President François Hollande, arguing that the January 2015 terrorist attacks were "gifts" for
his "unforgivable mistake" of partaking in conflicts that "[serve] no purpose".[40][38]
The director-general of TV5Monde, Yves Bigot, later said that the attack nearly destroyed the
company; if it had taken longer to restore broadcasting, satellite distribution channels would
have been likely to cancel their contracts. The attack was designed to be destructive, both of
equipment and of the company itself, rather than for propaganda or espionage, as had been
the case for most other cyber-attacks. The attack was carefully planned; the first known
penetration of the network was on January 23, 2015.[41] The attackers then carried out
4/24

reconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and
constructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected
hardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They
used seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France—one was a
company based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in
TV5's studios.[41] Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5
internal platforms, including its IT Internal Wiki, and verified that login credentials were still
valid.[41] During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from TACACS
logs to erase the firmware from switches and routers.[41]
Although the attack purported to be from IS, France's cyber-agency told Bigot to say only
that the messages claimed to be from IS. He was later told that evidence had been found
that the attackers were the APT 28 group of Russian hackers. No reason was found for the
targeting of TV5Monde, and the source of the order to attack, and funding for it, is not
known. It has been speculated that it was probably an attempt to test forms of cyberweaponry. The cost was estimated at €5m ($5.6m; £4.5m) in the first year, followed by
recurring annual cost of over €3m ($3.4m; £2.7m) for new protection. The company's way of
working had to change, with authentication of email, checking of flash drives before insertion,
and so on, at significant detriment to efficiency for a news media company that must move
information.[42]

root9B report (May 2015)
Security firm root9B released a report on Fancy Bear in May 2015 announcing its discovery
of a targeted spear phishing attack aimed at financial institutions. The report listed
international banking institutions that were targeted, including the United Bank for Africa,
Bank of America, TD Bank, and UAE Bank. According to the root9B, preparations for the
attacks started in June 2014 and the malware used "bore specific signatures that have
historically been unique to only one organization, Sofacy."[43] Security journalist Brian Krebs
questioned the accuracy of root9B's claims, postulating that the attacks had actually
originated from Nigerian phishers.[44] In June 2015 well respected security researcher
Claudio Guarnieri published a report based on his own investigation of a concurrent
SOFACY attributed exploit against the German Bundestag[45] and credited root9B with
having reported, "the same IP address used as Command & Control server in the attack
against Bundestag (176.31.112.10)", and went on to say that based on his examination of
the Bundestag attack, "at least some" indicators contained within root9B's report appeared
accurate, including a comparison of the hash of the malware sample from both incidents.
root9B later published a technical report comparing Claudio's analysis of SOFACY attributed
malware to their own sample, adding to the veracity of their original report.[46]

EFF spoof, White House and NATO attack (August 2015)

5/24

In August 2015, Fancy Bear used a zero-day exploit of Java, spoofing the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and launching attacks on the White House and NATO. The hackers used a spear
phishing attack, directing emails to the false URL electronicfrontierfoundation.org.[47][48]

World Anti-Doping Agency (August 2016)
In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent
to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login
details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites'
registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy
Bear.[49][50] According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged.[51]
Due to evidence of widespread doping by Russian athletes, WADA recommended that
Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics.
Analysts said they believed the hack was in part an act of retaliation against whistleblowing
Russian athlete Yuliya Stepanova, whose personal information was released in the breach.
[52] In August 2016, WADA revealed that their systems had been breached, explaining that
hackers from Fancy Bear had used an International Olympic Committee (IOC)-created
account to gain access to their Anti-doping Administration and Management System
(ADAMS) database.[53] The hackers then used the website fancybear.net to leak what they
said were the Olympic drug testing files of several athletes who had received therapeutic use
exemptions, including gymnast Simone Biles, tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and
basketball player Elena Delle Donne.[54] The hackers honed in on athletes who had been
granted exemptions by WADA for various reasons. Subsequent leaks included athletes from
many other countries.[53]

Dutch Safety Board and Bellingcat
Eliot Higgins and other journalists associated with Bellingcat, a group researching the
shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, were targeted by numerous
spearphishing emails. The messages were fake Gmail security notices with Bit.ly and
TinyCC shortened URLs. According to ThreatConnect, some of the phishing emails had
originated from servers that Fancy Bear had used in previous attacks elsewhere. Bellingcat
is known for having demonstrated that Russia is culpable for the shooting down of MH17,
and is frequently derided by the Russian media.[55][56]
The group targeted the Dutch Safety Board, the body conducting the official investigation into
the crash, before and after the release of the board's final report. They set up fake SFTP and
VPN servers to mimic the board's own servers, likely for the purpose of spearphishing
usernames and passwords.[57] A spokesman for the DSB said the attacks were not
successful.[58]

Democratic National Committee (2016)

6/24

Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the
Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016.[59][60] On March 10, phishing
emails that were mainly directed at old email addresses of 2008 Democratic campaign
staffers began to arrive. One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists.
The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level
Democratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two
factor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19.
Podesta's Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen. The
phishing attacks intensified in April,[60] although the hackers seemed to become suddenly
inactive for the day on April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's
electronic warfare services.[61] The malware used in the attack sent stolen data to the same
servers that were used for the group's 2015 attack on the German parliament.[1]
On June 14, CrowdStrike released a report publicizing the DNC hack and identifying Fancy
Bear as the culprits. An online persona, Guccifer 2.0, then appeared, claiming sole credit for
the breach.[62]
Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy
Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each
appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and
otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more
interested in traditional long-term espionage.[61] A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that
while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been
there a few weeks.[1]

Ukrainian artillery

An infected version of an app to control the D-30 Howitzer was allegedly distributed to the
Ukrainian artillery
See also: Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)
According to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the group used Android malware to target the
Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They distributed an infected version of an
Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer
artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the X-Agent spyware and
posted online on military forums. CrowdStrike initially claimed that more than 80% of
Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers were destroyed in the war, the highest percentage loss of any

7/24

artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would
mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces[63]).[64] According to the Ukrainian army CrowdStrike's numbers were incorrect
and that losses in artillery weapons "were way below those reported" and that these losses
"have nothing to do with the stated cause".[65] CrowdStrike has since revised this report after
the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) disavowed its original report, claiming
that the malware hacks resulted in losses of 15–20% rather than their original figure of 80%.
[66]

Windows zero-day (October 2016)
On October 31, 2016, Google's Threat Analysis Group revealed a zero-day vulnerability in
most Microsoft Windows versions that is the subject of active malware attacks. On
November 1, 2016, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group
Terry Myerson posted to Microsoft's Threat Research & Response Blog, acknowledging the
vulnerability and explaining that a "low-volume spear-phishing campaign" targeting specific
users had utilized "two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows
kernel." Microsoft pointed to Fancy Bear as the threat actor, referring to the group by their inhouse code name STRONTIUM.[67]

Dutch ministries (February 2017)
In February 2017, the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands
revealed that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch
ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs, over the previous six months. Rob
Bertholee, head of the AIVD, said on EenVandaag that the hackers were Russian and had
tried to gain access to secret government documents.[68]
In a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Ronald
Plasterk announced that votes for the Dutch general election in March 2017 would be
counted by hand.[69]

IAAF hack (February 2017)
The officials of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) stated in April 2017
that its servers had been hacked by the "Fancy Bear" group. The attack was detected by
cybersecurity firm Context Information Security which identified that an unauthorised remote
access to IAAF's servers had taken place on February 21. IAAF stated that the hackers had
accessed the Therapeutic Use Exemption applications, needed to use medications
prohibited by WADA.[70][71]

German and French elections (2016–2017)
See also: French presidential election, 2017; German federal election, 2017; and 2017
Macron e-mail leaks

8/24

Researchers from Trend Micro in 2017 released a report outlining attempts by Fancy Bear to
target groups related to the election campaigns of Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel.
According to the report, they targeted the Macron campaign with phishing and attempting to
install malware on their site. French government cybersecurity agency ANSSI confirmed
these attacks took place, but could not confirm APT28's responsibility.[72] Marine Le Pen's
campaign does not appear to have been targeted by APT28, possibly indicating Russian
preference for her campaign. Putin had previously touted the benefits to Russia if Marine Le
Pen were elected.[73]
The report says they then targeted the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation and Friedrich
Ebert Foundation, groups that are associated with Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic
Union and opposition Social Democratic Party, respectively. Fancy Bear set up fake email
servers in late 2016 to send phishing emails with links to malware.[74]

International Olympic Committee (2018)
On January 10, 2018, the "Fancy Bears Hack Team" online persona leaked what appeared
to be stolen International Olympic Committee (IOC) and U.S. Olympic Committee emails,
dated from late 2016 to early 2017, were leaked in apparent retaliation for the IOC's banning
of Russian athletes from the 2018 Winter Olympics as a sanction for Russia's systematic
doping program. The attack resembles the earlier World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) leaks.
It is not known whether the emails are fully authentic, because of Fancy Bear's history of
salting stolen emails with disinformation. The mode of attack was also not known, but was
probably phishing.[75][76]
Cyber Security experts have also claimed that attacks also appear to have been targeting
the professional sports drug test bottling company known as the Berlinger Group.[77]

Swedish Sports Confederation
The Swedish Sports Confederation reported Fancy Bear was responsible for an attack on its
computers, targeting records of athletes' doping tests.[78]

United States conservative groups (2018)
The software company Microsoft reported in August 2018 that the group had attempted to
steal data from political organizations such as the International Republican Institute and the
Hudson Institute think tanks. The attacks were thwarted when Microsoft security staff won
control of six net domains.[79] In its announcement Microsoft advised that "we currently have
no evidence these domains were used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred
control of them, nor do we have evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any
planned attack involving these domains".[80]

The Ecumenical Patriarchate and other clergy (August 2018)

9/24

According to the August 2018 report by the Associated Press, Fancy Bear had been for
years targeting the email correspondence of the officials of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople headed by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.[81] The publication
appeared at a time of heightened tensions between the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the
seniormost of all the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Russian Orthodox Church (the
Moscow Patriarchate) over the issue of the full ecclesiastical independence (autocephaly) for
the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, sought after by the Ukrainian government. The publication
cited experts as saying that the grant of autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine would erode
the power and prestige of the Moscow Patriarchate and would undermine its claims of
transnational jurisdiction.[81] Cyber attacks also targeted Orthodox Christians in other
countries as well as Muslims, Jews and Catholics in the United States, Ummah, an umbrella
group for Ukrainian Muslims, the papal nuncio in Kiev and Yosyp Zisels, who directs
Ukraine's Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities.[81]

Indictments in 2018

FBI wanted poster of officers indicted in connection to Fancy Bear
In October 2018, an indictment by a U.S. federal grand jury of seven Russian men, all GRU
officers, in relation to the attacks was unsealed. The indictment states that from December
2014 until a least May 2018, the GRU officers conspired to conduct "persistent and
sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international
organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their
strategic interest to the Russian government."[82][83] The U.S. Department of Justice stated
that the conspiracy, among other goals, aimed "to publicize stolen information as part of an
influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and
otherwise delegitimize" the efforts of the World Anti-Doping Agency, an international antidoping organization that had published the McLaren Report, a report that exposed extensive
doping of Russian athletes sponsored by the Russian government.[82] The defendants were
charged
with computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.

2019 think tank attacks
In February 2019, Microsoft announced that it had detected spear-phishing attacks from
APT28, aimed at employees of the German Marshall Fund, Aspen Institute Germany, and
the German Council on Foreign Relations.[84][85] Hackers from the group purportedly sent
phishing e-mails to 104 email addresses across Europe in an attempt to gain access to
employer credentials and infect sites with malware.[86][87]

2019 strategic Czech institution
In 2020, the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency reported a cyberespionage incident in an unnamed strategic institution, possibly the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs,[88] most likely carried out by Fancy Bear.[89]

2020 Norwegian Parliament attack
In August 2020 the Norwegian Storting reported a "significant cyber attack" on their e-mail
system. In September 2020, Norway's foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, accused
Russia of the attack. Norwegian Police Security Service concluded in December 2020 that
"The analyses show that it is likely that the operation was carried out by the cyber actor
referred to in open sources as APT28 and Fancy Bear," and that "sensitive content has been
extracted from some of the affected email accounts.".[90]

Characteristics and techniques

Diagram showing Grizzly Steppe's (Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear) process of employing spear
phishing
Fancy Bear employs advanced methods consistent with the capabilities of state actors.[91]
They use spear phishing emails, malware drop websites disguised as news sources, and
zero-day vulnerabilities. One cybersecurity research group noted their use of six different
zero-day exploits in 2015, a technical feat that would require large numbers of programmers
seeking out previously unknown vulnerabilities in top-of-the-line commercial software. This is
regarded
as a sign that Fancy Bear is a state-run program and not a gang or a lone hacker.
[92][93]
One of Fancy Bear's preferred targets is web-based email services. A typical compromise
will consist of web-based email users receiving an email urgently requesting that they
change their passwords to avoid being hacked. The email will contain a link to a spoof
website that is designed to mimic a real webmail interface, users will attempt to login and

11/24

their credentials will be stolen. The URL is often obscured as a shortened bit.ly link[94] in
order to get past spam filters. Fancy Bear sends these phishing emails primarily on Mondays
and Fridays. They also send emails purportedly containing links to news items, but instead
linking to malware drop sites that install toolkits onto the target's computer.[92] Fancy Bear
also registers domains that resemble legitimate websites, then create a spoof of the site to
steal credentials from their victims.[62] Fancy Bear has been known to relay its command
traffic through proxy networks of victims that it has previously compromised.[95]
Software that Fancy Bear has used includes ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT,
and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises a number of implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, X-Agent,
X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers.[62] Based on compile times, FireEye concluded
that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007.[95] To avert detection,
Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and
control channels, and modifies its persistent methods.[91] The threat group implements
counter-analysis techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings,
making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm.[95] Fancy Bear takes measures
to prevent forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically
clearing the event logs.[62]
According to an indictment by the United States Special Counsel, X-Agent was "developed,
customized, and monitored" by GRU Lieutenant Captain Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek.[2]
Fancy Bear has been known to tailor implants for target environments, for instance
reconfiguring them to use local email servers.[95] In August 2015, Kaspersky Lab detected
and blocked a version of the ADVSTORESHELL implant that had been used to target
defense contractors. An hour and a half following the block, Fancy Bear actors had compiled
and delivered a new backdoor for the implant.[23]

Education
Unit 26165 was involved in the design of the curriculum at several Moscow public schools,
including School 1101.[96]

Related personas
Fancy Bear sometimes creates online personas to sow disinformation, deflect blame, and
create plausible deniability for their activities.[97]

Guccifer 2.0
Main article: Guccifer 2.0
An online persona that first appeared and claimed responsibility for the DNC hacks the same
day the story broke that Fancy Bear was responsible.[98] Guccifer 2.0 claims to be a
Romanian hacker, but when interviewed by Motherboard magazine, they were asked
12/24

questions in Romanian and appeared to be unable to speak the language.[99] Some
documents they have released appear to be forgeries cobbled together from material from
previous hacks and publicly available information, then salted with disinformation.[99]

Fancy Bears' Hack Team
A website created to leak documents taken in the WADA and IAAF attacks was fronted with
a brief manifesto dated September 13, 2016, proclaiming that the site is owned by "Fancy
Bears' hack team", which it said is an "international hack team" who "stand for fair play and
clean sport".[100] The site took responsibility for hacking WADA and promised that it would
provide "sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances", beginning with the
US Olympic team, which it said "disgraced its name by tainted victories".[100] WADA said
some of the documents leaked under this name were forgeries, and that data had been
changed.[101][100]

Anonymous Poland
A Twitter account named "Anonymous Poland" (@anpoland) claimed responsibility for the
attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency[102] and released data stolen from the Court of
Arbitration for Sport, a secondary target.[103][104] ThreatConnect supports the view that
Anonymous Poland is a sockpuppet of Fancy Bear, noting the change from a historical focus
on internal politics. A screen capture video uploaded by Anonymous Poland shows an
account with Polish language settings, but their browser history showed that they had made
searches in Google.ru (Russia) and Google.com (US), but not in Google.pl (Poland).[103]

“spear-phishing” attacks — in which hackers send out phony emails intended to trick
people into visiting websites that look authentic but in fact enable them to infiltrate their
victims’ corporate computer systems — were tied to the APT28 hacking group, a unit of
Russian military intelligence that interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. The group
targeted more than 100 European employees of the German Marshall Fund, the Aspen
Institute Germany, and the German Council on Foreign Relations, influential groups
that focus on transatlantic policy issues.

with their permission, targeted 104 accounts belonging to organization employees
located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. MSTIC continues
to investigate the sources of these attacks, but we are confident that many of them
originated from a group we call Strontium. The attacks occurred between September
and December 2018. We quickly notified each of these organizations when we
discovered they were targeted so they could take steps to secure their systems, and
we took a variety of technical measures to protect customers from these attacks.
