Latest Target Attack of DarkHydruns Group Against Middle
East
2019-01-16 By 360威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪

Background

360 Threat Intelligence Center captured several lure Excel documents written in Arabic in January 9,
2019. A backdoor dropped by macro in the lure documents can communicate with C2 server through DNS
tunnel, as well as Google Drive API.
We conﬁrmed that this is a DarkHydrus Group’s new attack targeting Middle East region. In July 2018,
Palo Alto disclosed DarkHydrus Group which showed its special interest to governments in Middle East[1].
Prior to that report, we published detail analysis on malware exploiting CVE-2018-8414 vulnerability
(remote code execution in SettingContent-ms), which is believed a work of DarkHydrus[2].

Timeline

Timeline of activities of DarkHydrus Group:

Kaspersky named “LazyMeerkat” to this APT group. [4]

Filename

‫ﺍﻻﻁﻼﻉ‬.xlsm（viewing. xlsm）

This malware is a lure Excel document with name ‘‫ﺍﻟﻔﻬﺎﺭﺱ‬.xlsm’. When it is opened, embedded VBA
macro is trigged to run. That macro drops 12-B-366.txt to ‘%TEMP%’ directory ﬁrst, then leverages
regsvr32.exe to run 12-B-366.txt

12-B-366.txt is a HTA (HTML application) ﬁle, which will drop a PowerShell script to %TEMP%\\
WINDOWSTEMP.ps1

Finally, the PowerShell script drops %TEMP%\\OﬃceUpdateService.exe for execution by extracting
Based64-encoded content.

This backdoor is written in C#：

The PDB path has a project name ‘DNSProject’, which illustrates that the malware may leverage some
DNS techniques to achieve its goal.
C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio
2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Release\DNSProject.pdb
The backdoor checks if ‘st:oﬀ’ and ‘pd:oﬀ’ is given as paramters. If ‘st:oﬀ’ presents, no persistence
entry is added; PDF ﬁle is not dropped if ‘pd:oﬀ’ exists. Then it detects existence of virtual machine and
sandbox before malicious payload is triggered.

The backdoor will send collected information to C2 server through DNS tunnel. queryTypesTest function
is created for DNS tunnel communication.

Then, the backdoor tries to retrieve commands from C2 server via DNS tunnel, then through HTTP if
failed.

After C2 commands is retrieved successfully, commands are dispatched by taskHandler.

DNS Tunnel

DNS tunnel is a C2 communication technique in which malware send data and retrieve commands by
DNS query packets. This technique is very eﬀective since most gateways or ﬁrewalls allow both ingress
and egress DNS traﬃc.
If C2 server is assigned in the format of IP address in malware body, malware can contact C2 directly.
But OﬃceUpdateService.exe backdoor has C2 server in the format of DNS name, which requires a DNS
resolution to C2 domain name ﬁrst. To do that, the backdoor queries C2 domain in speciﬁc name server.
Then the backdoor communicates C2 server in DNS tunnel.
C2 domain names are following：

Name Server
Malware sends DNS queries to these two name servers for C2 domain name resolution:
‘tvs1.traﬃcmanager.live’ and ‘tvs2.traﬃcmanager.live’

Malware uses nslookup to send out DNS query, with following parameters: ‘timeout’ and ‘q’ for DNS
record type

C&C Commands
To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses diﬀerent regular
expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS A record, the malware will use following
regular expression:

Malware will retrieve a process ID as victim ID, then treats victim ID as subdomain name in C2
communication.

C2 commands are parsed out by regular expressions based on DNS record types.

We manually send out a DNS TXT query with victim ID as illustration.
A domain name ‘ajpinc.akamaiedge.live’ is created. In subdomain ‘ajpinc’, ‘a’ means this is the ﬁrst
request, and ‘c’ is the character for string end, while ‘jpin’ is process ID. Then, we send DNS query by
using nslookup command as following

The malware will use following regular expression to parse out command, ([\\w+).
(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live](ﬁle://w+).
(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live)).

To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses diﬀerent regular
expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in DNS AC record, the malware will use following
regular expression:

Following regular expression is for commands in DNS AAAA records,

Breakdown of regular expressions are as following,
Types of DNS record

Regular expressions

A

Address:\\s+(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)

AC

([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)

AAAA

Address:\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\w|:]+){1,8})

([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)

CNAME、TXT、SRV、SOA、MX and
(\\w+).(<C2DOMIAN>)

However, the malware will cancel operation if commands is matched by following regular expression:
"216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|window

Attribution

We found some traces which lead us to believe that DarkHydrus is behind this attack.

Samples with DNS Tunnel Function

Similar to the malware disclosed by Palo Alto[2], both malware use DNS tunnel technique:

Sandbox detection and Backdoor Capability

The new malware has very similar code of detection to sandbox and virtual machine as previous
DarkHydrus samples

Both samples have very similar code and functionality:

Pivot

One interesting ﬁnding is that, there is one Twitter user Steve Williams with handle name
@darkhydrus2. It’s coincident that both ‘darkhydrus’ (APT group name) and ‘Williams’ (user name in PDB
path) found in this Twitter user.

Summary

In recent APT incidents, more and more threat actors tend to adopt Oﬃce VBA macro instead of Oﬃce
0day vulnerability in the consideration of cost reduction. It is recommended that users avoid to open
documents from untrusted sources. And Oﬃce macro should be disabled by default.

Products of 360 ESG can protect users from this new malware, including 360 Threat Intelligence
Platform, SkyEye APT Detection, 360 NGSOC.
