Threat Thursday: BlackMatter RaaS - Darker Than DarkSide?

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

First identified in July 2021, BlackMatter is a new player in the Ransomware-as-as-Service (RaaS)
arena that many researchers have dubbed the successor to the recently retired Russian ransomware
gang DarkSide. However, a spokesperson for BlackMatter insists they are not the same operators.
BlackMatter has recently made headlines as the likely culprit behind cybersecurity incidents affecting
a major medical technology company and a U.S. farming cooperative.

About the BlackMatter Group
BlackMatter has been advertised on Russian underground forums, such as XSS and Exploit, looking
to recruit affiliates. They claim to have adopted the “best” attributes of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit.
Although these underground forums are among those that have banned ransomware advertisements
in the wake of the ransom attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021, BlackMatter circumvented this
restriction by advertising for “initial access brokers.” These brokers are criminal groups that have
gained access to corporate networks or machines.
In their posts, BlackMatter offers a payment of up to $100,000 USD. They state they are looking for
access to corporate networks in English-speaking countries, with targets that have between 500 and
1500 hosts and a revenue of over $100M.
The BlackMatter website provides information about the group and even its motivations. The RaaS
provider says it aims to fill a void in the market left by DarkSide and REvil pausing their activities. The
group’s advertising promotes the strengths of its malware to compete with existing offerings,
presumably to attract the most successful affiliates.
On their blog site, BlackMatter includes a list of rules defining sectors they do not attack; they claim to
offer free decryption to any victims in these sectors. This is most likely an attempt to avoid the
backlash suffered by REvil, Conti, and DarkSide in targeting such industries during 2021.
Unlike DarkSide and REvil, BlackMatter does not include any checks to ensure victims in certain
geolocations are not encrypted. BlackMatter will encrypt Russian systems, which may be another way
they’re trying to distinguish themselves from other threat groups.

Technical Analysis
Since July there have already been several versions and updates of BlackMatter identified. These
include versions 1.2, 1.6, 1.9 & 2.0. Additionally, a Linux® variant is available.
Statically analyzing a recent sample identifies the file as a Windows® 32-bit executable with a compile
stamp from the Aug. 16,2021. The file includes a .rsrc section, although the binary contains no
resources. This section is instead where the encoded configuration information is stored. The sample
reviewed is a BlackMatter variant version 2.0.
The binary uses only three libraries, and its import table contains a short list of Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs).

BlackMatter employs various methods to help evade detection and hinder researchers. For example,
most of the APIs and important strings are obfuscated. The executable will de-obfuscate these during
runtime as required. Although this approach is common with threat actors, the way it is implemented
by BlackMatter is very similar to the functionality found in DarkSide.
Directly after the file’s entry point, the binary resolves the addresses of the APIs it requires when
executing. The function shown in the image below dynamically loads additional libraries and APIs.

Figure 3: Function to resolve APIs and functions
The DWORD values point to blocks of encrypted hashes for each API, followed by a trailing
0xCCCCCCCC. Each hash is decrypted by an XOR operation.

The image below illustrates the libraries loaded before execution of the function sub_407DB0.

The following image illustrates the DLLs loaded into memory after the function to resolve APIs has
executed.

BlackMatter also employs anti-debugging techniques to hide threads from the debugger, which makes
it trickier to analyze. If it is analyzed while running under a debugger, the application will crash.
The binary accepts command line arguments when executed. If no argument is supplied, its default
action is to first verify the rights of the current user. If required, it will attempt to elevate privileges and
bypass User Account Control (UAC).
The malware creates a mutex to ensure that only one instance of the ransomware is running. The
mutex name is generated from a registry value relating to the MachineGuid; for example,
“Global\21661c2e54b253e217f64acc8644f973”.
The executable deletes three services relating to shadow copies – “vmicvss,” “vmvss” and “vss.”
Removing shadow copies is a common practice with ransomware, as it prevents victims from easily
restoring their systems.
5/11

BlackMatter will terminate common productivity-related processes to increase its impact. Terminating
these processes ensures that important files will not be locked, and valuable files can be encrypted.
The ransomware takes a multithreaded approach to enumerating the filesystem and executing the
encryption routine, to ensure that files are locked quickly. Local files and any found on connected
drives will be encrypted, while vital system files are skipped.
The BlackMatter encryption routine shares similarities with that of DarkSide. It uses custom
implementations of the Salsa20 and RSA-1024 algorithms. Only the first megabyte of each file is
encrypted, and the encrypted key is added to the end of the file. Partially encrypting files makes the
process much faster, which shortens the attack duration and leaves little time for the victim to react.
Encrypted files are appended with an extension consisting of an alpha-numeric string that varies
between attacks. Below is an example of an encrypted filename.

Figure 7: Encrypted file with appended extension “.3LqOKCiOu”
The ransomware drops a bitmap image file to C:\ProgramData\ and sets this as the victim’s
background through the registry.

Figure 8: Defining wallpaper image in the registry - 3LqOKCiOu.bmp
The wallpaper notifies the user their files have been encrypted by BlackMatter. The image itself
appears very similar to the one used by DarkSide.

A ransom note is also dropped into each directory as a text file. This text file is named using the same
extension as the encrypted files, appended with README.txt. For example,
“3LqOKCiOu.README.txt.”

Figure 10: BlackMatter ransom note
The ransom note provides the URL of an onion website (one accessible via TOR) where the victim
can pay if they wish to obtain the decryptor for their network.

The malware collects information from the victim’s machine and sends this data to its command-andcontrol (C2) servers in an encoded POST request. During our analysis, the sample in question
communicated with http[s]://mojobiden[.]com and http[s]://nowautomation[.]com.

Like most modern RaaS providers, BlackMatter uses the technique of double extortion. A leak site is
available on the dark net. Victims are threatened that their confidential data will be released publicly if
they choose not to pay.
