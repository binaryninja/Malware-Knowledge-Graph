A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

1 Introduction

2 Background

This Hotspot analysis takes a deep dive into the
cyber threat landscape between Japan and the People’s
Republic of China. In contrast to other threat landscape
reports, this analysis primarily looks at relevant
incidents that have – or had the potential - to spill into
the political realm. Meaning, it does not touch upon
traditional cybercrime, background noise activities, or
minor cyber-related incidents.

Since the birth of the People’s Republic of China
on October 1, 1949, diplomatic relations between
Tokyo and Beijing have gone through multiple cycles of
rapprochement and political tension. Despite, or
because of, these ups and downs, four unbridgeable
issues have become political constants over time and
space that occasionally spill over into the cyber
domain.

Section two provides political background
information on four issues deemed constants in JapanPRC relations, and explains the historical evolution of
cybersecurity and –defense policies in both countries.
Section three presents a chronological overview of
relevant cyber incidents, including infection vectors
and attribution assessments. Section four and five
identify the various teams connected to these
incidents, and extends insights into their history and –
if available - current state of play. Section six then
outlines social, economic, technical, and international
effects resulting from the overall cyber threat
landscape. And section seven concludes the analysis
with a look into the future.

(1) Historic animosity: Between 1930 and 1945,
Imperial Japan waged an aggressive colonization
campaign against large parts of mainland China, which
saw mass atrocities, such as the Nanjing massacre, and
human experimentation for biological warfare
purposes (ex. Unit 731). These war-wounds have never
healed despite numerous friendship treaties between
both countries, rapidly expanding trade relations,
offers of reparation payments, and longstanding
Japanese official development assistance to China.
The specific reasons are multiple, but to a large
degree, historical animosity is still leveraged by Beijing
to rally support around nationalistic sentiments and to
deflect any form of criticism voiced by Tokyo. This
includes issues such as China’s rapidly increasing
military spending and Beijing’s enduring human rights
violations - stretching back from the Tiananmen
massacre in 1989 to today’s ‘re-education’ of millions
of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province. In most
instances it is even the other way around, with China
consistently calling out Japan on its annual defense
budget - despite Beijing currently spending four times
more – and accusing Tokyo of re-militarization efforts
by arguing that Japan is “deny[ing] its history of
aggression, challeng[ing] the post-war order, and
harm[ing] the feelings of the people of those victimized
nations” (Deutsche Welle, 2013; Johnson, 2019).
In the cyber domain, historic animosity most
notably manifests itself in the form of Chinese
hacktivists
DDoS’ing
and
defacing
Japanese
government websites, particularly around the 18th of
September, which marks the beginning of the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria in 1931.
(2) The rise of China: Between 1946 and 1992,
Japan experienced an era of rapid economic growth,
propelling it to become the world’s second largest
economy behind the United States. China in turn,
opened itself up to foreign trade and investment in
1979, and overtook Japan in 2010/11 when measured
in nominal GDP (McCurry & Kollewe, 2011). While
estimates vary, some analysts suggest that the Republic
will become the world’s largest economy sometime
between 2028 and 2050.
The rise of China has serious security
implications for Japan, ranging from Beijing’s increased

3

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

military spending and modernization efforts, Chinese
hegemonic assertions abroad, and a creeping
restructuring of both the global economy and the
international political system at large. It should thus
come as no surprise that Tokyo views Beijing’s Belt and
Road initiative (BRI) as a vehicle for expanding China’s
economic stranglehold across the globe.
To counter Chinese ambitions, the Japanese
government developed, and has recently begun to
promote, its own concept of a ‘Free and Open IndoPacific’ (FOIP) as part of its official foreign policy
(Miyake, 2019). So far however, FOIP has gained little
traction internationally as it only exists on two jumbled
power point presentations and a short YouTube video
put together by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA, 2019b).
In its 2019 White Paper, the Japanese Ministry
of Defense placed - for the first time since 2007 - the
section on China’s defense policies second behind the
United States. In all the 12 years prior, the defense
policies on the Korean Peninsula occupied the second
spot. Many analysts have interpreted this subtle
change as a strategic shift in the MoD’s threat
prioritization vis-à-vis the People’s Republic (Kelly,
2019). The White Paper also specifically identified the
Belt and Road Initiative as a possible cover for the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to advance its activities
abroad (MoD, 2019a, p. 20).
In regard to the cyber domain, the rise of China
proceeds in lockstep with Chinese espionage
campaigns against a variety of Japanese industrial
sectors and government agencies.
(3) Territorial dispute: Consisting of five islets
and three rocks in the East China Sea, the uninhabited
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands are currently administered by
the Japanese government and claimed by both China
and Taiwan. 1 The territorial dispute flares up
occasionally when Chinese submarines, frigates, and
fishing trawlers enter the contiguous zone around the
islands, or Chinese jet fighters violate Japanese
airspace above. On September 7, 2010, a Chinese
fishing trawler eventually collided with a Japanese
coast guard vessel in the disputed waters. After
detaining the Chinese skipper, relations between
Beijing and Tokyo took a nosedive for the worse,
including large-scale protests in both countries, the
cancellation of bilateral meetings on the ministerial
level and above, and even the arrest of four Japanese
citizens in China on the suspicion of illegally filming in a
military area. On September 24, the Chinese skipper
was returned, due to Japanese concerns over further
damaging bilateral relations, and on October 9, all four
1 Note: Because Taiwan views itself as the only legitimate Chinese

government, every historical territorial claim that Beijing puts
forward, Taiwan emulates in its own way. This is true for the
Diaoyu/Senkaku islands and the 9-dash line in the South China Sea.

Japanese citizens previously arrested were released
from Chinese custody.
The Diaoyu/Senkaku island dispute in part
overlaps with the unresolved historic animosity
between both countries. Meaning, any major clash or
event touching the islands also mobilizes Chinese
nationalistic hacktivists into action.
(4) Military alliance: In the aftermath of World
War II, Japan committed itself to a pacifist constitution,
which under Article 9 proclaims that, “the Japanese
people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the
nation and the threat or use of force as means of
settling international disputes” (Japanese Constitution,
1946). The article continues to note that “in order to
accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land,
sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will
never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the
state will not be recognized” (Japanese Constitution,
1946).
On September 8, 1951, Tokyo and Washington
signed the ‘Security Treaty between the United States
and Japan,’ which forms the bedrock of regional
stability and US military power projection across the
Indo-Pacific.
Consecutive
Japanese
cabinets
subsequently re-interpreted Article 9 to mean that the
right of self-defense would still be permissible. As a
result, Japan has build-up a self-defense naval, air, and
ground force whose military budget is unofficially
capped at 1% of GDP – a ceiling established by then
Prime Minister Takeo Miki in 1976 (Wright, 2016, p. 3).
According to the IISS’ Military Balance 2019, Japan’s
annual defense budget is the eight highest in the world,
currently standing at $47.3 billion USD (The Military
Balance, 2019, p. 21).
As part of the US-Japan alliance agreement,
Japan is also host to 23 US military bases and
approximately 50,000 US soldiers. Among them, the 7th
carrier fleet stationed at Yokosuka naval base, and the
18th Air Wing at Kadena AFB – the self- proclaimed
“hub of airpower in the Pacific” (kadena.af.mil).
In terms of military activity, a look at the 2018
statistics published by the Japanese Ministry of Defense
reveals that Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force was
“scrambled 638 times against Chinese aircraft, an
increase of 138 times compared to the previous fiscal
year” (MoD, 2019b, p. 1). In its 2018 Defense white
paper, the Japanese MoD therefore noted that,
“China’s sea and air power is expanding its operational
areas surrounding Japan, including the area around
[the] Senkaku Islands” (MoD, 2018a, p. 3).
From a Chinese point of view, the US-Japan
alliance is largely seen as a fulcrum to protect the
geopolitical status quo and contain Beijing in East Asia
and beyond. Chinese analysts however do diverge on
ascertaining whether the US government is actively
trying to push Tokyo to revise its pacifist constitution

over time, or whether Washington’s influence is
actually helping to push back against Japan’s full-blown
re-militarization desires (Glaser, 2015).
In cyberspace, Tokyo and Washington are both
pushing for deeper cooperation and coordination. At
the 2019 Japan-US Security Consultative Meeting, the
allies affirmed that “international law applies in
cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain
circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the
purposes of Article V of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty”
(MOFA, 2019a, p. 1). To date, no cyberattack against
Japan has breached this threshold.

2.1 Japanese cybersecurity & defense
policy
On November 30, 1985, the roughly 300member strong Japan Revolutionary Communist
League – also called Chukaku-ha or Middle Core Faction
( 中 核 派 ) – simultaneously targeted 35 key rail
communication and signal systems in and around
Tokyo and Osaka. They slashed vital cables in gutters
along tracks and set fires inside signal boxes at key
sections of Japan National Railways (Haberman, 1985).
The group subsequently succeeded to knock out
numerous switching systems, telephone hookups,
computerized booking operations, and effectively shut
down “23 commuter lines during the morning rush
hour” for approximately 6.5 to 12 million commuters
(Haberman, 1985; Moosa, 1985). According to
Littleton, the group “jammed police and rescue radio
frequencies in an attempt to hamper and delay
response by the authorities” (Littleton, 1995). The LA
Times also reported that, “commuters who switched to
automobiles in an attempt to get to work created
traffic jams of as long as 28 miles on expressways
leading into Tokyo,” and that “more than 50 schools in
the Tokyo area closed for the day” (Jameson, 1985).
Although no one was injured and the severed
cables were repaired within 24 hours, the incident
marked the first and to-date only occurrence in Japan
of what at the time was coined “techno terrorism.” A
de-facto pinpoint strategy that was not aimed at
blowing up infrastructure, but severing critical control
circuits to disconnect command and control systems
and “causing disruption in cyberspace” (Littleton,
1995). 2
It took another 15 years for the Japanese
government to be eventually ‘shocked’ by two events
to take cybersecurity and cyber defense increasingly
seriously.
2 Note: According to the LA Times, “by noon, 48 people, including the

three top leaders of the Chukaku-ha […] had been arrested”
(Jameson, 1985)

In reaction to Tokyo’s decision to allow the goahead for a controversial conference in Osaka on
January 23, 2000, titled ‘The Verification of the Rape of
Nanking: The Biggest Lie of the 20th Century,’ Chinese
nationalistic hacktivists mobilized on January 29 and
bombarded Japanese government e-mail inboxes,
redirected website queries to porn sites, and defaced
several sites with anti-Japanese messages. Messages
ranged from “Nippon [Japan] is rotten animal,” to
“Japanese - As all peoples know, it's a folk which has no
concern to face the truth of history. They are the
disgrace of Asia" (Watts, 2000). According to The
Guardian and ScanNetSecurity, the hacktivists also
wiped census data from the website of the
government’s statistical bureau, and tried to gain
access to the Bank of Japan, the Foreign Ministry, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fisheries, the Labor Agency, the Defense
Agency, and Japan's Management and Coordination
Agency (BBC, 2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000). The
hacktivists signed off as the “Brazil p00 Hackerz” and
“Billy
in
Hunan
Province”
(Watts,
2000;
ScanNetSecurity, 2000)
On March 2, 2000, Japanese police investigators
announced that computer companies affiliated with
the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday sect, “developed
software programs for at least 10 government
agencies, including the Defense [Agency],” and “more
than 80 major Japanese companies” (Sims, 2000).
According to George Wehrfritz at Newsweek, the
investigators also determined that “the first contracts
were awarded in 1996--one year after the cult
mounted a nerve-gas attack on Tokyo's subway system
that killed 12, injured 5,000 and stunned the nation”
(Wehrfritz, 2000). Calvin Sims over at the New York
Times aptly explains the significance of this revelation
by noting that “underscoring the immense fear that the
sect provokes in Japan, the Defense [Agency] and the
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the
country’s main provider of telephone and internet
service, immediately suspended the use of all computer
software developed by companies linked to Aum”
(Sims, 2000).
Combined with the Chinese hacktivist campaign
one month prior, and the techno terrorism incident of
1985, the Japanese government decided to prioritize
combatting the threat of “cyber terror” (サイバーテロ) front
and center.
The Metropolitan police agency for example
“set up a special squad of 50 police officers to
investigate internet crime,” and the government said it
“will dispatch officials to the US to seek advice on
measures to prevent cyber terrorism” (Watts 2000). On
October 23, 2001, The Japanese Metropolitan Police
also established the Council for Countermeasures

5

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

against Cyber Terrorism (サイバーテロ対策協議会) - which to
this day encompasses an important role in Japanese
law enforcement cooperation and coordination with
key infrastructure providers. 3 The incidents also
spurred the adoption of the special action plan to
protect Japan’s critical infrastructure from cyber terror,
which includes measures such as reviewing critical
infrastructure protection and establishing and
strengthening public-private partnerships (ISMPO,
2000).
In reaction to the Chinese hacktivist onslaught,
the Japanese Self-Defense Forces also decided to setup military Computer Emergency Response Teams
(CERTs) within the three service wings. The Air Force’s
Computer Security Evaluation Squadron (航空自衛隊システ
ム監査隊 ) was create on May 8, 2000; the Ground
Force’s System Protection Technology Unity (陸上自衛隊
シ ス テ ム 防 護 隊 ) in 2001; And the Maritime Force’s
Communication Security Group (海上自衛隊保全監査隊)
was founded in March 2002 (NISC 2004, p. 40). 4
Over the years, the cyber terrorism narrative
slowly crumbled as there was no clear definition on
what the term cyber terrorism actually included and
excluded. The Japanese police for example defined
cyber terror as broadly as “an electronic attack on a
critical system of critical infrastructure or a serious
failure in a critical system of critical infrastructure”
(MPD, n.d.). Already by 2004, Japan’s Information
Technology Promotion Agency concluded that
“according to a strict definition of the term terrorism,
there are no known cases of cyber terrorism to date”
(IPA, 2004, p. 38).
In February 2006, the Information Security
Policy Council (ISPC) released Japan’s ‘First National
Strategy on Information Security.’ The document
particularly focused on raising cybersecurity awareness
and creating a ‘Japan Model’ IT ecosystem - which was
to be “regarded as a synonym for high quality, high
reliability safety and security, or just simply to create ‘a
nation which should be revitalized by the value of
trustworthiness’” (ISPC, 2006, p. 5). Overall, the
document treated cybersecurity as a purely technical
issue devoid of political and national security
implications. Notably absent from the strategy were
any mentions of advanced persistent threats (APT),
3 The

Council has been holding an annual conference since 2001
which brings together government officials and critical infrastructure
operators, and serves as a coordinating venue to prepare for major
events being held in Japan (ex. the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and
Paralympic Games). On Dec. 6, 2018, 65 operators from 14 sectors –
ranging from information and communications, finance, aviation,
railway, power, gas, medical, water, logistics, chemical, credit, oil –
participated in the conference (MPD, n.d.).

Japan.”

state sponsored non-state actors, or even nationalistic
hacktivists. Terrorism was mentioned only twice within
the 33-page long document. And both times it was
qualified as “crimes and terrorism” – following the
trend that cyber terrorism was increasingly seen as a
sub-threat of foreign government supported
cybercrime.
In 2009, the ISPC published the ‘Second National
Strategy on Information Security.’ The new document
recognized for the first time the importance of
international partnerships and the discussion of
countermeasures in the context of national security
and protecting critical information infrastructure (ISPC,
2009, p. 22). While cybercrime was prominently
featured in the report, the threat of ‘cyber terror’
entirely disappeared.
In reaction to the July 2009 barrage of denial-ofservice attacks against US and South Korean
government, media, and financial websites, the ISPC
pushed out the ‘Information Security Strategy for
Protecting the Nation’ in May 2010 (Weaver, 2009;
ISPC, 2010,). As Gady correctly highlights, “the
document appears to lay out a distinct Japanese
mindset of the time - seeing cyberattacks as analogous
to unpredictable natural disasters rather than concrete
actions of state and non-state adversaries” (Gady,
2017, p. 12-13).
In mid- to late-2011, multiple Japanese
government servers eventually fell victim to targeted
intrusions - including the Japanese House of
Representatives, the House of Councilors, the Japanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications, multiple Japanese
embassies across the globe, as well as Japan’s largest
defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The
ISPC’s ‘Information Security 2012’ report soberly
assessed that “in 2011, threats of targeted attacks,
cases of which were reported to have previously
occurred overseas, emerged in Japanese government
agencies. […] The risk of such possible sophisticated
cyber attacks aimed at stealing important government
information is expected to further escalate, and thus
there is a strong demand for measures to improve and
combat such a situation” (ISPC, 2012, p. 2-3).
In June 2013, the ISPC released Japan’s first
‘Cybersecurity Strategy.’ The document emphasized
that in the near future “there is potential for cyber
attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the software of […]
systems to directly result in obstruction of
communications, transportation disorder, blackouts
and other large social turmoil and possibly even
deaths” (ISPC, 2013, p. 9). For the first time ever, the
ISPC also highlighted the role of the Japanese Ministry
of Defense in this new warfare domain. Given Japan’s
constitutional constraints on offensive operations, the
document exclusively focused on the creation of a
dedicated Cyber Defense unit within the Japanese SelfDefense Force, to support readiness and preparedness,

6

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

improving surveillance capabilities, holding realistic
exercises, training talented personnel, and carrying out
advanced research and development. The strategy
furthermore stressed the importance of the application
of international law to cyberspace, cooperation with
the United States in the context of the military alliance,
as well as specifically providing technical and policy
support to the 12 member states within the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (ISPC, 2013, p. 4951). Overall, Japan’s first cyber strategy emphasized the
creation of a resilient cyber nation, including close
public-private partnerships and a multi-stakeholder
approach to internet governance. 5
In 2015, Washington and Tokyo eventually
published the new ‘Guidelines for Japan-US Defense
Cooperation.’ 6 Section 6 in the document outlines that
the alliance partners will: “maintain a posture to
monitor their respective networks and systems; share
expertise and conduct educational exchanges; ensure
resiliency of their respective networks and systems to
achieve mission assurance; contribute to whole-ofgovernment efforts to improve cybersecurity; and
conduct bilateral exercises to ensure effective
cooperation for cybersecurity in all situations from
peacetime to contingencies” (MoD, 2015). In the event
of a serious cyber incident that affects the security of
Japan, the guidelines note that the “two governments
will consult closely and take appropriate cooperative
actions to respond” (MoD, 2015).
In July 2018, the Japanese government
published its third and latest Cybersecurity Strategy.
Under point 4.3.2. the strategy emphasizes that “in
order to protect Japan’s national security interest from
cyberattacks, it is important to secure Japan’s resilience
against cyberattacks and increase Japan’s ability to
defend the state (defense capabilities), deter
cyberattacks (deterrence capabilities), and be aware of
the situation in cyberspace (situational awareness
capabilities)” (Japanese Government, 2018, p. 37).

5 Note: On February 10, 2015, the IPSC was absorbed into the Cyber

Security Strategic Headquarters. See: NISC, 2015

6 Note: The last time the Guidelines for Japan-US Defense

Cooperation were overhauled was in 1997.

2.2 Chinese cybersecurity & defense
policy
Parallel to Beijing opening itself up to the
internet in the mid-1990s, Chinese military planners
and domestic security services recognized the dangers
of so-called ‘informatization’ – a ominous term that
describes the comprehensive integration of
information technology to impact all aspects of society
and mechanisms of statehood – including domestic
security and modern warfare (Griffiths, 2019, p. 35-43).
While China did indeed implement sweeping internet
regulations and filtering mechanisms prior to allowing
commercial access to the internet in 1995 - whose
elements Wired dubbed the ‘Great Firewall of China’ the stranglehold was still lose enough for citizens to
organize themselves online (Barme & Ye, 1997).
In 1999, Beijing’s fears of ‘informatization’
eventually materialized when the spiritual Falun Gong
movement – which encompassed an estimated 70
million practitioners in China at the time – organized
large-scale protests in 30 cities, including 10,000
protesters amassing around Zhongnanhai - the
headquarter of the Communist Party in Beijing - to
demand legal recognition of the movement and
freedom from state interference. According to Lewis,
“the Internet was one of the primary tools used to
organize the demonstrations” (Lewis, 2006, p. 1). What
followed was a massive crackdown with hundreds of
thousands Falun Gong practitioners arrested, and
hundreds extrajudicially executed. Alongside this
purge, the Chinese government also launched a
propaganda campaign “the like of which had not been
seen since the heights of the Cultural Revolution,”
including even DDoS attacks against websites overseas
associated with the movement (Griffiths, p. 54;
Denning, 2017).
In contrast to the initial hopes that the internet
would foster democracy, solidarity, and allow for the
free flow of information and ideas to and within China,
Beijing has subsequently regulated, censored, filtered,
and molded the Chinese internet to exercise political
control over and through it. US President Clinton’s
mocking words when he declared in March 2000 that
“China has been trying to crack down on the Internet.
Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the
wall,” did not age well (NYT, 2000).
In November 2012, Xi Jinping was appointed
General Secretary of the Communist Party and
Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As one of
his first acts in office he announced the creation of the
so-called Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and
Informatization (中央网络安全和信息化领导小组). Over the
years this high-level group chaired by Xi has become
central to pulling together China’s fragmented cyberpolicy landscape and direct change from the top.

7

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

Overall Chairman Xi is currently aggressively pushing
four interlocked concepts to reposition China in the
world.
(1) A harmonious internet - Given China’s broad
concept of national security, which spans both
domestic stability and countering threats from abroad,
a harmonious internet seeks to guide public opinion,
support good governance, and foster economic growth.
To achieve these objectives, Beijing has been exercising
ever-tighter control over the content posted online to
stymie political mobilization and prevent any flow of
information that might undermine the regime. In 2014,
Xi established the Cyberspace Administration of China
(CAC)(国家互联网信息办公室), which is subordinate to the
Central Leading Group and tasked with “controlling
online content, bolstering cybersecurity, and
developing the digital economy” (Segal, 2018). While
the CAC has been vital for the development of China’s
initial cyberspace governance framework, it also ran
into numerous power struggles with other ministries
unwilling to step aside – most notably the Ministry of
Public Security, the Ministry of Propaganda, and the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. In
2018, the Leading Group was upgraded to the Central
Cyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和信息化委
员会), allowing the CAC to “depend less on staff and
resources loaned from relevant ministries and to exert
greater authority over functional power centers across
government.” As a result, Creemers et al. expect the
CAC to exercise “a stronger role in protecting China’s
critical information infrastructure and directing its
technical censorship apparatus via the Great Firewall”
(Creemers et al., 2018).
(2) Cyber sovereignty - To support and defend
the harmonious internet from its critics abroad and at
home, Beijing has endorsed the concept of state
sovereignty in cyberspace. According to Xi, cyber
sovereignty is “the right of individual countries to
independently choose their own path on cyber
regulation and internet public policies, and participate
in international cyberspace governance on an equal
footing” (FMPRC, 2015). As Adam Segal succinctly
notes, “China envisions a world of national internets,
with government control justified by the sovereign
rights of states” (Segal, 2018).
While there are numerous Chinese laws and
regulations that have increasingly expanded the legal
basis for Chinese sovereignty in cyberspace, two laws
are at its helm. In 2016, Beijing enacted the Cyber
Security Law of the People's Republic of China (中华人民
共和国网络安全法), which to date is “the most visible
document in a wider Chinese effort to govern
cyberspace and secure the country’s digital
infrastructure” (Triolo et al. 2017). According to
Wagner, “the law requires network operators to

cooperate with Chinese crime or security investigators
and allow full access to data and unspecified ‘technical
support’ to the authorities upon request. The law also
imposes mandatory testing and certification of
computer equipment for critical sector network
operators” (Wagner, 2017). In terms of data
localization, the law mandates that network operators
in critical sectors store all data gathered or produced in
mainland China. The law also bans “the export of any
economic, technological, or scientific data that would
pose a threat to national security or the public interest”
(Wagner, 2017). The Cyber Security Law came into
effect on June 1, 2017. Eight months later, Apple
officially moved all of its Chinese iCloud operations to a
local firm in southern China, and for the first time ever
“began hosting its iCloud encryption keys in China,
instead of the US” (Liao, 2018).
Enacted on July, 27, 2017, China’s new National
Intelligence Law (中华人民共和国国家情报法) “repeatedly
obliges individuals, organizations, and institutions to
assist Public Security and State Security officials in
carrying out a wide array of ‘intelligence’ work”
(Tanner, 2017). Article 2 starts by explaining that the
law adheres to the “overall national security
perspective,” a term coined by Xi Jinping in 2014 which
virtually puts every issue – whether military, political,
economic, social, technological, cultural or otherwise –
within the realm of intelligence collection. Article 7
then goes on to explain that “any organization or
citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state
intelligence work according to law.” According to
Tanner this is a calculated measure “to drive wedges of
mistrust between U.S. or foreign citizens or firms, and
their Chinese partners” (Tanner, 2017). It is also an
expression that Beijing considers itself strong and
economically important enough to “call for intelligence
cooperation even from foreigners doing business in
China” (Tanner, 2017).
(3) Techno-Nationalism and military-civil fusion
In November 2012, Xi Jinping also set forward the
political guideline of military-civilian fusion, which
envisions a two-way technology transfer and a resulting
interdependence between the military and the civilindustrial sector. Meaning, on the one hand, it
encourages civilian participation in the development of
military technology. On the other, it stipulates the
application of military technology in the civilian realm.
Military-civilian fusion walks in lockstep with the idea
of techno-nationalism e.g. the notion of technological
interdependence, a strong high-tech army, and
dominance in the areas of AI, quantum computing,
robotics, and the setting of international standards. To
achieve this development trajectory as fast as possible,
the 2019 Annual Report of the US Department of
Defense to Congress notes that, “China uses a variety

8

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

of methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use
technologies, including targeted foreign direct
investment, cyber theft, and exploitation of private
Chinese nationals’ access to these technologies, as well
as harnessing its intelligence services, computer
intrusions, and other illicit approaches. In 2018,
Chinese efforts to acquire sensitive, dual-use, or
military-grade equipment from the United States
included dynamic random-access memory, aviation
technologies, and antisubmarine warfare technologies”
(OSD, 2019, p. iii).
Falling into the same strategy of military-civilian
fusion is also the rapid expansion of Chinese tech giants
abroad and their ever-growing cooperation with the
Chinese government domestically. Huawei and Tencent
are probably the two most well-known examples, with
the former accused of maintaining close links to the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Ministry of
State Security (MSS), and the latter being an eager
accomplice in implementing China’s repressive policies
at home, while partly owning popular computer games
played by millions abroad – including Fortnite and
PUBG (Singh, 2019; Cook, 2019).

2019, p. 48). The creation of the SSF is in line with
Chinese thinking on ‘cyberspace superiority’ and “using
offensive cyber operations to deter or degrade an
adversary’s ability to conduct military operations
against China” (OSD, 2019, p. 57). The DoD further
notes that “Chinese writings suggest cyber operations
allow China to manage the escalation of a conflict
because cyber attacks are a low-cost deterrent. The
writings also suggest that cyber attacks demonstrate
capabilities and resolve to an adversary. To support
A2/AD, Chinese cyber attack operations aim to target
critical military and civilian nodes to deter or disrupt
adversary intervention, and to retain the option to
scale these attacks to achieve desired conditions with
minimal strategic cost” (OSD, 2019, p. 56).
As of this writing, – and according to open
source - China has not conducted any offensive cyber
operations against Japan that have touched the
threshold for the use of force.

Note: Some analysts suggest that the global
expansion of Chinese high-tech companies and capital
is synonymous to a digital Silkroad strategy and thus a
supporting component to Beijing’s Belt and Road
initiative (CSIS, 2019).
(4) Cybersecurity & defense – Apart from the
items already mentioned under the header of cyber
sovereignty, China has “publicly identified cyberspace
as a critical domain for national security and declared
its intent to expedite the development of its cyber
forces” (OSD, 2019, p. 64). According to the US
Department of Defense, “PLA writings note the
effectiveness of [information operation] and
cyberwarfare in recent conflicts and advocate targeting
an adversary’s C2 and logistics networks to affect its
ability to operate during the early stages of conflict.
They credit cyberattacks on an enemy’s C2 system with
the potential to ‘completely disrupt’ these systems,
paralyzing the victim and thus gaining battlefield
superiority for the attacker. Accordingly, the PLA may
seek to use its cyberwarfare capabilities to collect data
for intelligence and cyberattack purposes; to constrain
an adversary’s actions by targeting network-based
logistics, communications, and commercial activities; or
to serve as a force multiplier when coupled with kinetic
attacks during armed conflict” (OSD, 2019, p. 64).
In 2016, the PLA fused together disparate
information warfare and cyber capabilities to create
the Strategic Support Force (SSF)(中国人民解放军战略支援
部 队 ), which serves as “a theater command-level
organization to centralize strategic space, cyber,
electronic, and psychological warfare missions” (OSD,

3 Threat landscape
chronology
This section provides a chronological overview
of relevant events between 2000 and 2019, pertaining
to the interaction between Japan and the People’s
Republic of China in cyberspace. Gold marks events in
which a technical and/or political attribution was
made. Light blue marks events with no attribution
assessment whatsoever, but whose targeting strongly
overlaps with Chinese national interests. As far as open
source information is available, there have been no
reported cyber incidents in China that were attributed
to Japan-based threat actors, nor any data breaches in
China that might be considered to be in line with
Japanese national security interests.
September regularly stands out historically as
the month that sees very high activity from Chinese
national hacktivists hitting Japanese targets. This
activity relates to the anniversary of the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria in September 18, 1931, and the
establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo. It is
important to note that Chinese hacktivist do not
mobilize every year with the same veracity. It ebbs and
flows depending on other factors that are outside the
purview of this paper. September 2011 for example
was a very quiet month, possibly due to the ongoing
Fukushima nuclear incident that captured headlines
around the world. Meanwhile, September 2012 saw
the largest onslaught of Chinese hacktivists to date due
to the Japanese government officially purchasing the
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands on September 11, 2012.
Please also note that the month of September is
an exception in terms of causality. It markedly stands
apart from the more opportunistic driven Chinese
hacktivist campaigns – such as when the Japanese
Prime Minister visits the Yasukuni Shrine - or other
Japan-related news that make their way onto Chinese
social media and bulletin boards to inevitably serve as a
reason to organize anti-Japanese campaigns.
The overwhelming majority of incidents listed
below have little to no connection to historical dates or
geopolitical events. To date, Chinese activity against
Japan can overall be categorized as a persistent cyber
espionage campaign in line with supporting China’s
long-term strategic interests.

Events
In reaction to Tokyo’s decision to give the goahead to a controversial conference in Osaka,
titled “The Verification of the Rape of Nanking:
The Biggest Lie of the 20th Century,” Chinese
nationalistic hacktivists bombarded e-mail
inboxes, redirected queries to porn sites, and
defaced several Japanese websites with antiJapanese messages.
Messages included: “Nippon [Japan] is rotten
animal,” and “Japanese - As all peoples know,
it's a folk which has no concern to face the
truth of history. They are the disgrace of Asia."
(Watts, 2000)
According
to
The
Guardian
and
ScanNetSecurity, the hacktivists wiped census
data from the website of the government’s
statistical bureau, and tried to gain access to
the Bank of Japan, the Foreign Ministry, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Labor
Agency, the Defense Agency, and Japan's
Management and Coordination Agency (BBC,
2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000)
In reaction to the onslaught, the
“Metropolitan police agency set up a special
squad of 50 police officers to investigate
internet crime,” and the government said it
“will dispatch officials to the US to seek advice
on measures to prevent cyber terrorism”
(Watts 2000). The incident also spurred the
adoption of a special action plan to protect
Japan’s critical infrastructure from cyber
terrorism, including measures such as
reviewing critical infrastructure protection,
and establishing and strengthening publicprivate partnerships (ISMPO, 2000).
The hacktivists signed off as the “Brazil p00
Hackerz” and “Billy in Hunan Province” (Watts,
2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000)
According to CrowdStrike, APT12/IXESHE was
targeting Japanese organizations during the
Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was “most
likely done to close intelligence gaps on the
ground
cleanup/mitigation
operation”
(Meyers, 2013).
A DDoS attack is launched against Japan’s
National Policy Agency (NPA), temporarily
making the website inaccessible.
According to a statement released by the NPA,
the attack was organized on a major Chinese
bulletin board, in reaction to events
surrounding the Diaoyu/Senkaku Island
dispute (NPA, 2011).
Japanese defense contractor Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries (MHI) is breached. In
September Japanese media outlets report on
the breach citing internal MHI documents.
Japanese government officials are furious as
this is the first time they hear of the MHI
breach, because the company failed to report
the incident to the authorities (McCurry,
2011).
On September 21, Mitsubishi confirmed that it
was breached but that no classified
information was leaked (MHI, 2011). Overall,
83 computers in at least 11 locations were
infected with eight different malware
products. According to the New York Times,
the “Tokyo headquarter, factories, and a

research and development center were
accessed in the breach” (Tabuchi, 2011). The
BBC noted that “the viruses targeted a
shipyard in Nagasaki, where destroyers are
built, and a facility in Kobe that manufactures
submarines and parts for nuclear power
stations. [And] plant in Nagoya, where the
company designs and builds guidance and
propulsion systems for rockets and missiles”
(BBC, 2011). MHI is a contractor for Raytheon
and Lockheed and builds the F-15 fighter jet,
Patriot missile defense batteries, as well as the
AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile in Japan. On
October 24, Asahi reports that the attackers
“likely netted military data on warplanes and
information on nuclear power plants” (Kubota,
2011).
Japanese defense contractor IHI Corporation
and Kawasaki Heavy Industries also reported
that they received malware-ridden emails for
months, but their security systems filtered
them out (Kubota, 2011).
According to the Asahi Shimbun, computers
and servers used by the Japanese House of
Representatives were infected when a Trojan
was emailed to a Lower House member in July
2011. The attackers gained access to email
communications and stole usernames and
passwords. In early November, Deputy Chief
Cabinet Secretary Isao Saito further explained
that, "the upper house office has confirmed
that seven suspicious emails, the same ones
that were sent to the lower house, were
found" (Phys.org, 2011) None of the House of
Councilor’s email servers were compromised.
(Phys.org, 2011).
At the time, Sophos noted that although one
exfiltration server was located in mainland
China this was not sufficient evidence to leap
to a Chinese operation (Cluley, 2011).
In September 2013, Kaspersky released its
report on Icefog – a small Chinese APT group,
possibly mercenaries for hire - which focus on
targets in South Korea and Japan. The report
goes on to state that, “back in 2011, we
analyzed malware samples that were used to
attack several Japanese organizations. Among
the attacked organizations were the Japanese
House of Representatives and the House of
Councilors” (Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 14).
The Yomiuri Shimbun reports that “at least
dozens of computers used at Japanese
diplomatic offices in nine countries [Canada,
China, France, Myanmar, The Netherlands,
South Korea, and the US] have been infected
with” an unspecified backdoor (Yomiuri
Shimbun, 2011). The Japanese Foreign
Ministry
launched
an
investigation,
“suspecting the infection was caused by socalled spear attacks targeting the ministry's
confidential diplomatic information” (Yomiuri
Shimbun, 2011). It is unclear whether the
investigation has led to any results.
According to then Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism,
Takeshi Maeda, a server at Japan’s Geospatial
Information Authority (GSI) was illegally
accessed. (Geospatialworld.net, 2011) The GSI
noted that the affected server was used for
“very long baseline interferometry, in which
radio waves from stars are picked up through
several antennas, and the difference in arrival

time is used to measure distances”
(Geospatialworld.net, 2011). No personal or
confidential information was accessed, but
scientific data may have been compromised.
Some analysts speculate that the GSI server
might have been targeted as a trusted hop-off
point to compromise other government
systems (Ryall, 2011).
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA) discovers that “a computer terminal
used by one of our employees was infected
with a computer virus, and information stored
in the computer as well as system information
that is accessible by the employee have been
leaking outside” (JAXA, 2012a). On March 27,
the investigation concludes with the result
that no classified data was stored on the
affected system, and no sensitive data on the
H-II Transfer vehicle (HTV) was leaked.
According to JAXA, the infection vector was a
malicious email send to an employee who “did
not update the computer [Office automation]
software” (JAXA, 2012b).
Trend Micro publishes its report on Luckycat.
It notes that “in addition to targeting Indian
military research institutions, as previously
revealed by Symantec, the same [cyberespionage] campaign targeted entities in
Japan as well as the Tibetan community. […]
We were able to track elements of this
campaign to hackers based in China” (Trend
Micro, 2012, p. 1). While Trend Micro does not
name any specific Japanese victims, it does
state that “the Luckycat campaign […] has
been linked to 90 attacks against targets in
Japan and India as well as Tibetan activists. […]
In sum the Luckycat campaign managed to
compromise 233 computers” (Trend Micro, p.
1).
The dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands
intensifies as Tokyo decided to buy the islands
on September 11 from the Japanese family
who had owned them for the past 100+ years.
The date of the purchase coincides with the
anniversary of the Mukden Incident of
September 18, 1931, which led to the
Japanese invasion of Manchuria and
establishment of the puppet state of
Manchukuo
On September 18 the Honker Union conducts
DDoS attacks, doxing campaigns, and
defacements against 19 Japanese websites.
According to the Japanese National Police
Agency, 11 sites were hit with DDoS attacks,
including the Japanese Defense Ministry and
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Japanese
Supreme Court, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology. At least six other sites were
defaced with the Chinese flag (NPA, 2012). At
the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the
hacktivists also leaked the names and
telephone numbers of over 1000 staffers
(Muncaster, 2012).
Overall, the Honker Union shortlisted around
300 sites with over 4,000 individuals posting
messages about planned attacks on the
Chinese chat site YY. According to then
Minister
of
Internal
Affairs
and
Communication, Tatsuo Kawabata, the DDoS
attacks were most intense on Sunday
afternoon (September 16) with 95% of traffic
originating from China (Kyodo News, 2012).

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
announces another breach (JAXA, 2012c). The
leaked
information
possibly
included
specification
and
operation
related
information on numerous space launch
vehicles. On February 19, 2013 JAXA publishes
the results of its investigation. According to
the press release a computer terminal was
infected on March 17 with a spoofed email
dated March 15. The release notes that,
“access from the said terminal to an outside
malicious website was detected between
March 17, 2011 and November 21, 2012. The
communication volume and contents were
unknown, and we cannot deny the possibility
that information has been leaked from the
said terminal” (JAXA, 2013a).
Citing government sources, the Daily Yomiuri
reports that the computer of an employee at
the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries had been infected last year.
More than 3000 documents were exfiltrated,
including 20 top-secret documents on the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact
negotiations, documents on the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit meeting in
November 2011, and the Japan-US summit
meeting in April 2012 (Phneah, 2013).
The
infected
computer
allegedly
communicated with a server in South Korea.
The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) announces that it was informed by
the National Information Security Center
(NISC) of a “suspicious communication from a
computer within MOFA with an external
server” (MOFA, 2013). The Ministry suspects
that “approximately 20 documents were
leaked from the computer” (MOFA, 2013).
Mandiant releases its APT 1 report. 7 By April
2014, Mandiant observes that APT 1 ceased
almost all of its activities between February
13, 2013 to August 1, 2013 (Fung, 2014).
Cylance also noticed “a fairly large lul in
activity from March-August 2013,” explaining
that the “activity didn’t cease entirely, but the
volume of malware SPEAR was able to collect
during this period was remarkably decreased”
(Gross, 2016, p. 4).
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA) is breached for the third time. On July
2, 2013, JAXA published the results of its
investigation (JAXA, 2013b). According to the
report one server - which stored the ID and
passwords of four other servers - was
compromised. Technical information related
to the Japan Experimental Module “Kibo”
(JEM) and the space station replenisher
“Kounotori” (HTV) were exfiltrated. Personal
email addresses were also leaked.
Kaspersky releases its report on Icefog, which
notes that the APT also targeted Fuji TV and
the Japan-China Economic Association
(Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 33).
FireEye publishes a blogpost on APT12/IXESHE
noting that the group “recently started a new
campaign targeting organizations in Japan and
Taiwan. APT12 is believed to be a cyberespionage group thought to have links to the
Chinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's

targets are consistent with larger People's
Republic of China (PRC) goals” (Moran &
Oppenheim, 2014).
FireEye publishes its report titled ‘Operation
Quantum Entanglement’ which identifies two
separates yet connected campaigns.
The first is the Moafee group, which operates
out of Guangdong province and targets
“governments and militaries of countries with
national interests in the South China Sea” (Haq
et al. 2014, p. 17). The second is the
DragonOK group operating out of Jiangsu
province, “which targets high-technology and
manufacturing companies in both Japan and
Taiwan” (Haq et al. 2014, p. 4). The report
explains that “DragonOK used similar malware
to the Moafee group. Specifically, we
observed DragonOK employing PoisonIvy,
Nflog, Mongall, CT, and NewCT” (Haq et al.
2014, p. 19). The report goes on to note that,
“we believe that these groups are from two
distinct regions in China and possibly (1) are
collaborating, (2) received the same training,
(3) have a common toolkit supply chain, or
some combination of these three” (Haq et al.
2014, p. 3).
Symantec reports that CloudyOmega actively
exploited an Ichitaro zero-day in the wild
(Japanese Office Suit Software) to target
Japanese organizations. Symantec traces
CloudyOmega’s campaign back to at least
2011. According to the blogpost “the public
sector in Japan is the most targeted sector hit
by Operation CloudyOmega” (Symantec,
2014). Other Japanese sectors include: the
chemical sector, the financial sector, trading
companies, conglomerates, and think tanks.
On April 14, Palo Alto Network’s Unit 42
identifies a new DragonOK backdoor deployed
against Japanese targets in at least five
phishing campaigns. According to the blogpost
“all five phishing campaigns targeted a
Japanese manufacturing firm over the course
of two months, but the final campaign also
targeted a separate Japanese high-tech
organization” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig,
2015).
The Japanese Pension Service (JPS) is
breached. Since May 8, JPS received 124
malicious emails. Five staffers opened some of
them and the infection spread to 31
computers. Between May 21-23 the personal
information of 1.25 million Japanese citizens
was exfiltrated. On June 1, the JPS publicly
announced in a press conference that its
network was breached (JPS, 2015). The total
amount for remediation cost and recovery is
calculated to be around $8 million USD
(Kakumaru et al. 2016, slide 4). On May 20,
2018, Japanese law enforcement closes the
criminal investigation without any results.
On November 6, 2015, JP-CERT/CC notes that
the attack against the “Japan Pension Service
indeed drew nationwide attention, but Emdivi
has victimized several other government and
private organizations. This attack campaign,
specifically targeting Japan, is also known as
‘CloudyOmega’ named by Symantec, or ‘Blue
Termite’ by Kaspersky” (Kubo & Kubo, 2015).
As of this writing, the exfiltrated documents of
neither breach have been used for malicious
purposes, which likely indicates that they are

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

used for operational purposes by a foreign
government agency.

Note: Around the same time in June the US
Office of Personnel Management announced
that it was breached and the personal
information of 22.1 million US government
employees was exfiltrated.
Raytheon submits its secret report on Stalker
Panda to the US government. The report
notes that the group has possible links to the
PLA and has conducted “targeted attacks
against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the
United States” […] centered on political,
media, and engineering sectors” (Raytheon,
2015, p. 1).
Kaspersky releases its findings on Blue
Termite – noting that the Chinese
cyberespionage campaign “has been targeting
hundreds of organizations in Japan” since
2013 (Kaspersky Lab, 2015).
In the aftermath of the JPS breach, several
Japanese organizations also report that they
have been targeted/breached by Blue
Termite/CloudyOmega/EMDIVI,
including:
The Petroleum Association of Japan (June 9),
the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (June 10), the National Institute for
Health Services (June 13), the Japan Energy
Service Corporation (June 17), Waseda
University (June 22), and the Japanese
Ministry of Justice (June 25) (Kakumaru et al.
2016, slide 5).
Cylance releases its report on Operation Dust
Storm which became active around 2010. The
report notes that “attack telemetry in 2015
indicates the Dust Storm group has migrated
from more traditional government and
defense-related intelligence targets to
exclusively seek out organizations involved in
Japanese
critical
infrastructure
and
resources. The group recently compromised a
wide breadth of victims across the following
industry verticals: electricity generation, oil
and natural gas, finance, transportation, and
construction” (Gross, 2016, p. 1).
Cylance also highlights an attack by Dust
Storm in early February 2015 targeted an
unnamed “investment arm of a major
Japanese automaker” (Gross, 2016, p. 4). And
it also discovered two campaigns in JulyOctober 2015 against an unnamed Japanese
subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility
and an unnamed major Japanese oil and gas
company (Gross, 2016, p. 6).
Symantec releases a blog post on Tick/Bronze
Butler
noting
that
“a
longstanding
cyberespionage campaign has been targeting
mainly Japanese organizations with its own
custom-developed malware. The group,
known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a
low profile, appearing to be active for at least
10 years prior to discovery. […] Tick’s most
recent attacks have concentrated on the
technology, aquatic engineering, and
broadcasting sectors in Japan” (DiMaggio,
2016a).
On Oct. 12, 2017, Secureworks releases its
threat analysis on Tick/Bronze Butler. It notes
that the group “likely originates in the
People’s Republic of China” and has run a
long-standing campaign intended to “exfiltrate

intellectual property and other confidential
data
from
Japanese
organizations”
(Secureworks, 2017).
The
Japanese
Business
Foundation
(Keidanren) officially reports that its network
has been breached.
On July 1, 2014, the Keidanren's International
Cooperation Bureau received an email with a
malicious attachment that triggered the
breach (most likely a backdoor). According to
Asahi, the e-mail was sent from an
organization that Keidanren officials often
worked with, and which was involved in the
bilateral relations with China. It was later
uncovered that the computer system of that
organization had also been hacked earlier. On
July 3, a remote access tool was installed on
the Keidanren system. Two months later the
exfiltration of documents and emails began to
a server based in China's Guangdong province
(Sudo, 2019).
It wasn't until early October 2016 that
Keidanren officials were informed by the
company overseeing its computer system that
suspicious transmissions had been uncovered.
According to Kyodo News, the “investigative
team found a large amount of suspicious data
communications between 10 external servers
and 23 infected PCs” (Kyodo News, 2019).
Keidanren eventually paid several hundreds of
millions of yen to replace its computer system.
It is not entirely clear from open source
reporting whether APT10 was responsible or
not.
According to Kyodo News, the Defense
Information Infrastructure (DII) - which is the
name for the joint network of Japan’s SelfDefense Forces – was targeted by a
“sophisticated cyberattack” (Kyodo, 2016).
The news report notes that “possibly a state
actor, […] gained unauthorized access to
computers at the National Defense Academy
and the National Defense Medical College,
using them as a gateway to enter the [Ground
Self-Defense Force’s] computer system”
(Kyodo, 2016). According to Kyodo News, “the
incident prompted the ministry and the SDF to
temporarily ban internal internet use” (Kyodo
2016).
To date, no open-source information is
available as to what infected the DII, how far it
penetrated into the network, nor whether any
data was actually compromised or exfiltrated.
FireEye reports in July 2017 that: APT10 sent
an email related to an annual budget for
scientific research to a Japanese government
agency to deliver the HAYMAKER and
BUGJUICE malware. APT10 targeted a
Japanese manufacturer with an email lure
related to China’s defense strategy and news
events such as the assassination of Kim JongNam. APT10 also targeted a Japanese
company in the media and entertainment
industry (APSM, 2017).
BAE Systems and PwC UK release their report

In July 2017, Trend Micro publishes a blog post
on the ChessMaster campaign which targets
“Japanese academia, technology enterprises,
media outfits, managed service providers,
and government agencies” (Sy et al. 2017).
The post also explains overlaps between
APT10,

In reaction to the US DoJ indictment of two
Chinese hackers associated with the Ministry

German public broadcasters BR and NDR
release their investigation into Winnti, noting
that it is a “presumably China-based” “digital
mercenary” group that is “attacking
companies in Japan, France, the U.S. and
Germany” (Tanriverdi et al. 2019). The report
further notes that Winnti targeted Japan’s
biggest chemical company, Shin Etsu
Chemical, in 2015, and penetrated the
networks of Sumitomo Electric in the summer
of 2016 (Tanriverdi et al. 2019).

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

4 Japanese teams
targeting China
The Japanese MoD has a defensive framework in
place for responding to cyberattacks against its own
information systems, but the Japanese Self-Defense
Forces do currently not have the legal authority to
offensively engage adversaries outside the MoD’s wire
during peacetime (MoD, n.d.). That being said, the
overhaul of the National Defense Guidelines in
December 2018 has lain the groundwork for allowing
the SDF to – in case of an armed attack against Japan “block and eliminate the attack by leveraging
capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic
domains” (Cabinet Secretariat, 2018, p. 12). According
to the guidelines, this also includes capabilities to
disrupt an opponent’s use of cyberspace amidst an
attack against Japan (MoD 2018b, p. 20).
In 2019, the MoD outsourced the development
of offensive cyber capabilities to one or several
unnamed private Japanese companies – mirroring the
MoD’s cooperation with Fujitsu in 2012. 8 The
conceptual idea is that the SDF will utilize these
offensive cyber capabilities for defensive purposes
during wartime and deterrence purposes during
peacetime. Yet, how this will actually work in practice is
currently anyone’s best guess.
The most likely route will be that the SDF’s
Cyber Defense Group (サイバー防衛隊) will become the
MoD’s tip of the spear. 9 The Group was established in
May 2013 (Nikkei, 2013) and politically consolidated in
June with the adoption of Japan’s first Cybersecurity
Strategy (ISPC, 2013, p. 42). Currently, the Cyber
Defense Group serves as the milCERT for the SDF’s joint
network - called the Defense Information
Infrastructure. Meaning, the Group’s capabilities are
similar to the CERT teams within the three SDF service
wings. 10 In FY2019, the SDF’s Cyber Defense Group is
set to increase its staffing from 150 to 220 (MoD,
2018c, p. 6). For FY2020, the plan is to increase that
number to 290 (MoD, 2019c, p. 6). 11 As of this writing,
the SDF has not conducted any offensive cyber
operations against Chinese targets.

There is little to no open-source information
available as to what Japan’s intelligence agencies are
doing in cyberspace. According to a 2008 NSA memo
published by The Intercept in 2018, the MoD’s
Directorate for Signal Intelligence (DFS)(電波部) is “still
caught in a Cold War way of doing business,” which
makes it “very hard to engage with them in
multinational forums or even to get them to
collaborate across Japanese government lanes.
Bilaterally (NSA-DFS) they are a good partner, but they
are very reluctant to participate with mixed or larger
groups” (The Intercept, 2017, p. 1). The small trove of
NSA documents tackling the DFS shows that the
directorate has been learning from the NSA since 2012
to set up its own “SIGINT-enabled cyber operations” to
enhance and streamline DFS’ data collection efforts
(The Intercept, 2018). It is unknown whether the DFS,
or any other Japanese intelligence agency – most
notably the Cabinet Intelligence and Research
Organization (CIRO), the MoD’s C4 Systems
Department (J6), or the Ministry of Justice’s Public
Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) - have conducted
any computer intrusions into Chinese systems.
As far as available open source information
goes, there are also no known Japan-based non-state
actors that have targeted Chinese companies or
government agencies. Please note that, given the lack
of in-depth research on Japanese non-state actors in
cyberspace, this assessment is very shaky. Future
historical research might reveal dynamics that we know
little about today.
Disclaimer: Research inquiries send to the
Chinese International Press Center (IPC) – to get in
touch with the Chinese Ministry of Defense and the
Ministries of Public and State Security – went
unanswered despite several follow-up emails. Similarly,
getting in touch with information security vendor
Qihoo 360 - to gain insights into China’s threat
landscape - were sadly unsuccessful.

8 Note: Back in 2012, the MoD outsource the development of a ‘seek

and destroy’ malware to Fujitsu (Leyden, 2012). Open sources are not
entirely clear as to whether the Fujitsu malware failed to produce the
expected results or why exactly the product was shelved in end.

9 Note: In the official English translation, the provisional name for the

Cyber Defense Group was “Cyber Defense unit” (small u). Its official
name now is the Cyber Defense Group.

10 Staffing numbers for the three service wing CERTs: The GSDF
System Protection Unit (Army)(FY2020: ~140 personnel), the MSDF
Communication Security Group (Navy)(FY2020: ~100 personnel), and
the ASDF Computer Security Evaluation Squadron (Air Force)(FY2020:
~130 personnel).
11 The

Cyber Defense Group is a joint unit and thus draws its
members from the three service wings.

5 Chinese teams targeting
Japan
The number of Chinese teams hitting Japanese
assets can be roughly divided into four categories:
Nationalistic hacktivist, the People’s Liberation Army,
The Ministry of State Security, and contractors/
mercenaries-for-hire. This section discusses the various
actors, their characteristics, preferred targets and
tooling as per open source information available.
Note: The section tries to differentiate between
proprietary and widely available tooling. However, the
line between these two categories is not as steadfast as
the terminology suggests. Widely available tools are
broadly defined all those pen-testing and red team
tooling that is either legitimate (ex. Mimikatz), or
whose malware products are extensively used by a
number of different ATP threat actors/cybercriminals.
On the other hand, proprietary tools are defined as
custom designed malware products that are exclusively
used by one particular threat actor or group of threat
actors. The author recognizes that this categorization is
not perfect, and that depending on one’s visibility,
some proprietary tools could be classified as being
widely available.
Disclaimer: Security vendors do occasionally
disagree on whether a certain group is responsible for a
specific campaign or targeted infection. This paper
recognizes that the art of technical attribution has its
limitations and difficulties, and that not every security
vendor will agree with every attribution assessment
made. Similarly, this paper understands that it is
generally inappropriate to attribute an attack to a
group solely based on the malware deployed or
infrastructure used. Please also note, that each major
vendor has their own APT naming convention. 12

5.1 Nationalistic Hacktivists
In the late 1990s, Chinese nationalistic
hacktivists mobilized for the first time when riots broke
out across Indonesia in 1998, and when the US
accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
during the Kosovo conflict in 1999.
In the Indonesian case, Chinese netizens were
outraged when news of targeted attacks against
Chinese-Indonesians reached the international ethnic
Chinese communities. The May 1998 riots were
subsequently labelled as "anti-Chinese" and Chinese
netizens set up discussion boards and social media
groups to organize defacements of Indonesian
government websites (Desombre & Byrnes, 2018). As
12 For additional APT aliases see: MISP, n.d.; MITRE Att&ck, n.d.;
ThaiCERT, 2019

Dsombre and Byrnes explained, “many of these boards
evolved into the first Chinese hacking groups”
(Desombre & Byrnes, 2018, p. 6).
One year later, the death of three Chinese
reporters amidst the US bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, sparked numerous DDoS attacks
against NATO email servers, defacements of US
government websites, and a flood of malware-ridden
emails targeting NATO and US government officials
(Stout, 1999). Out of the ashes - of what Wired labeled
the “first Internet war” - emerged the largest and most
prominent Chinese hacktivist collective – the Honker
Union of China – which although fragmented, remains
active today. 13
Honker Union (中国红客)
Tooling
Proprietary: Unknown
Widely available: Various; HTran
Targets
Targets designated by geopolitical events. Predominately, Japanese
ministerial and agency websites, and Japanese bulletin boards.

The Honker Union emerged during the late
1990s and primarily gravitated around the longstanding cnhonker.com forum. Over the years, many
Union members ventured into the legitimate
cybersecurity sector and provided insights into the
group. In a 2013 interview with the South China
Morning Post, former Union member Liu Qing for
example explained that, “I am mature businessman
now, but I am proud to have participated in a patriotic
cyberwar back then” (Nan, 2013). According to Liu, he
joined the Union after the Hainan Island Incident in
April 2011, when an EP-3 US spy plane collided with a J8 Chinese jet fighter in mid-air. The body of the Chinese
pilot was never recovered and the US plane had to
conduct an unauthorized emergency landing at the
PLA’s Lingshui air base. According to Liu, hundreds of
Chinese websites suffered attacks believed to have
originated from the US in the aftermath of the incident
– leading Liu and others to discuss counterstrike plans.
As Liu put it “we were so angry and decided to fight
back” (Nan, 2013). For the Honker Union the counterUS campaign on May 1, 2001 was a landmark event.
According to the SCMP, “the group attracted more than
80,000 members in the following months, making it the
largest hacker organization to date in China’s internet
history” (Nan, 2013).
Soberly looking back however, one has to
conclude that this episode of hacktivist mobilization
was one of severe over-interpretation and misguided
media reporting. Back in late-April 2001, Jericho and
Sioda over at Attrition.org summarized it aptly when
13 The term "honker" literally translates into "red guest” in Chinese,

e.g. “black hat.”

16

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

they noted that: (a) Website defacements happen all
the time, (b) the US hackers that defaced Chinese
websites initially had no political agenda at all
(Poisonbox and Pr0phet), and (c) after Wired reported
about an ongoing US hacker campaign against China –
without actually providing any tangible evidence –, the
whole story developed its own dynamics. As Jericho
and Sioda put it, “the collective dick-waving of a bunch
of script-kidiots fueled by so-called journalists
generating media hype” led to “the former trying to
feed their egos and the latter to feed their hit counts”
(Jericho & Sioda, 2001).
In 2010, the Honker Union prominently went to
“war” against Iran, after the Iranian Cyber Army
hijacked the DNS records of China’s most popular
search engine Baidu to redirect its traffic to a website
featuring the sentence "protesting the military
intervention of foreign and Israeli sites in our internal
affairs division and distribution of false news”
(Danchev, 2010). It is still unclear why the Iranian Cyber
Army targeted Baidu in the first place, nor whether
they expected Chinese hacktivists to just simply stand
by and watch. Naturally, it did not take long for several
Iranian websites to be DDoS’d, defaced with Chinese
flags, and plastered with messages such as "We are
China’s hacker! Let the world hear the voice of China!
The state is higher than the dignity of all!" (China
Economic Review, 2010).
Today the Honker Union is largely “fragmented
and divided between several different forums, with
different levels of activity” (Edwards, 2018). This
structure works rather well to strengthen Chinese
hacktivism at large, as most platforms maintain a
hierarchical structure that actively trains new members
on the lower levels, and hones the skills of advanced
actors at the top. Meaning the Union can mobilize
quantity over quality without degrading its advanced
operations.
Despite rumors to the contrary, it is unclear
whether the Honker Union, or any of the other Chinese
hacking communities, had or do currently maintain
direct ties to the Chinese government, military, or the
intelligence services. It is highly likely that the line
between nationalistic hacktivism and working for the
Chinese government is murky at best, non-existent at
worst.
Note: HTran, also called the HUC Packet
Transmit Tool, was written by Honker Union member
lion and bkbll in 2003 (lion & bkbll, 2003). It is a
“rudimentary connection bouncer, designed to redirect
TCP traffic destined for one host to an alternate host”
(Stewart, 2011). Its primary purpose is to “disguise
either the true source or destination of Internet traffic
in the course of hacking activity” (Stewart, 2011).
HTran is widely used outside the Chinese hacktivism

scene, including by Chinese threat actors such as APT1,
APT12, and DragonOK (Bureau & Jennings, 2018).

Contrary to the ‘loud’ activities by the Honker
Union, the LuckyCat hackers are one prominent
example of a ‘silent’ campaign executed by members of
the Chinese hacking community.
Symantec was the first to publicly report on the
LuckyCat campaign back in March 2012. According to
the report, the group conducted a series of attacks
against Indian military research and South Asian
shipping organizations. The data stolen varied from
case to case, but appeared to be simply geared at
documents with suggestive names. Meaning, the
hackers also inexplicably exfiltrated documents that
were publicly available on the victim’s website. All in
all, Symantec describes the attackers as “us[ing] very
simple malware, which required little development
time or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web
hosting, to implement a highly effective attack”
(Symantec, 2012a, p. 1).
Later in the same month, Trend Micro took a
deeper dive into LuckyCat. In terms of targeting, Trend
Micro highlighted that the campaign was linked to at
least “90 attacks against targets in Japan and India as
well as Tibetan activist” (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 1).
Trend Micro also uncovered significant overlaps with
other campaigns, including ShadowNet and DuoJeen.
The former historically targeting Tibetan activists
abroad, while the latter targets the Tibetan community
within China (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 12-17).
In terms of attribution, Trend Micro
“connect[ed] the email address used to register one of
LuckyCat’s command-and-control servers to a hacker in
the Chinese underground community. He used the
nickname ‘dang0102,’ and published posts in the
famous [Chinese] hacker forum, XFOCUS, as well as
recruited others to join a research project on network
attack and defense at the Information Security Institute
of the Sichuan University” (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 2).
Symantec’s findings concur with Trend Micro’s
attribution assessment, noting that “45 different
attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43
were within the same IP address range based in
Sichuan province, China” (Symantec, 2012a, p. 2).

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

5.2 People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
As early as 2002, the first reports emerged that
a group operating out of Shanghai and linked to the
People’s Liberation Army was conducting computer
exploitation against US government organizations.
According to a 2008 Wikileaks cable, the US State
Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security explained
that Byzantine Candor - also known as the Comment
Group – hit the “U.S. Army, […] other DoD services, as
well as [Department of State], Department of Energy,
additional [US government] entities, and commercial
systems and networks” (Wikileaks, 2008). In 2013,
Mandiant published its groundbreaking APT1 report,
which identified APT1 as the 2nd Bureau of the PLA’s 3rd
Department – also known as Unit 61398 - operating out
of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai (Mandiant, 2013,
p. 3 & 26). The Comment Group was APT1’s first known
campaign against a foreign government. On May 1,
2014, the US Department of Justice indicted five PLA
officers – all members of Unit 61398 - for “computer
hacking, economic espionage and other offenses
directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear
power, metals and solar products industries” (US DoJ,
2014). According to then U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder, the case represented “the first ever charges
against a state actor for this type of hacking” (US DoJ,
2014).
Responding to these development Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson Qin Gang, merely stated that
"the Chinese government, the Chinese military and
their relevant personnel have never engaged or
participated in cyber theft of trade secrets” (Xinhua,
2014).
Two PLA-connected Chinese teams are known to
have hit Japanese assets.
APT1/Comment Group
Tooling
Proprietary: PoisonIvy variants; SeaSalt
Widely available: Various; Mimikatz
Targets
Primarily US focused: IT sector, aerospace, public administrations,
satellites and telecommunications, scientific research and
consulting, energy, transportation, construction and manufacturing,
international organizations, engineering services, high-tech
electronics, legal services, media and entertainment, navigation,
chemicals, financial services, food and agriculture, metals and
mining, healthcare, and education

APT1 gained notoriety when Mandiant released
its report in 2013, aptly titled “APT1: Exposing One of
China’s Cyber Espionage Units.” Mandiant connected
APT1 to activity by the Comment Group in 2002 and
observed the group compromising 141 companies
spanning 20 industrial sectors since 2006. The majority
of APT1 targets were located in the US (115), with only

one unnamed target located in Japan (Mandiant, 2013,
p. 22).
After the release of the Mandiant report, APT1
delayed its return to normal operations following the
Chinese New Year holiday in February 2013. It
eventually re-emerged six months later after shifting its
operational infrastructure. With the Chinese
government vehemently denying any connection to
APT1, Mandiant’s Laura Galante rightly noted that,
because “APT1 is supporting this denial storyline the
government is telling, [it] shows that they wanted to be
seen as not actively doing this, or at least to cover up
their involvement" (Fung, 2014). It is not exactly clear
when APT1 ceased its activity after re-emerging in
August.
Note: In 2018, McAfee uncovered code based on
APT1’s Seasalt malware – which the group last used in
2010 - in a new implant McAfee named OceanSalt. The
curious part of the story is that the “source code used
by APT1 never became public, nor did it wind up on the
black market” (Barrett, 2018). McAfee therefore
suggest two possible explanations. Either APT1 has
returned, or another adversary is conducting a falseflag operation to suggest that APT1 has re-emerged
(Samani & Sherstobitoff, 2018). Given the exposure of
APT1 in 2013, it is highly likely that the group was split
and its tooling disseminated to other PLA teams with
better operational security.

In October 2012, APT12 famously breached the
computers of 53 employees at the New York Times
(Perlroth, 2013). According to then NYT chief
information officer Marc Frons, “they could have
wreaked havoc on our systems. […] But that was not
what they were after” (Perlroth, 2013). As the NYT
reported four month later, APT12 “appeared to be
looking for […] the names of people who might have
provided information to [NYT Shanghai bureau Chief]
[David] Baboza,” who published an investigative piece
on October 25, 2012, titled the “Billions in hidden
riches for family of Chinese leader” (Perlroth, 2013).
Based on thousands of corporate documents, Barboza
uncovered and published a piece investigating the
relatives of Wen Jiabao – then China’s Prime Minister –

18

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

who had accumulated a fortune through shady
business dealings (Barboza, 2012). 14
Notably, APT12 also targeted Japanese
organizations during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in
2011, which, according to CrowdStrike, was “most
likely done to close intelligence gaps on the ground
cleanup/mitigation operation (Meyers, 2013).
FireEye posits that “APT12 is believed to be a
cyber espionage group thought to have links to the
Chinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's targets are
consistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC)
goals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this
group are in-line with PRC goals and self-interest in
Taiwan” (FireEye, n.d.).
One particular characteristic of APT12 is that it
closely monitors online media related to its tooling and
operations. Meaning, it adapts very quickly to public
exposure by using new tools, tactics, and procedures
(Moran & Oppenheim, 2014). Additionally the group
likes to hide its activities by using compromised
machines within a target’s internal network as
command and control servers. It also uses the opensource proxy tool HTran to mask its true location
(Sancho et al., 2012, p. 15).

14 Note: Prime Minister is the informal westernized title. The official
Chinese description is ‘Premier of the State Council of the People's
Republic of China.’

5.3 Ministry of State Security (MSS)
It is not entirely clear when exactly China’s main
intelligence agency - the Ministry of State Security –
made its entry into the field of cyber espionage. Three
MSS connected APTs have stood out in recent years
due to being doxed by the ominous group known as
Intrusion Truth.
Starting in 2009, APT10 conducted numerous
espionage campaigns against US defense industrial
base companies, the technology and communications
sector, as well as multiple companies around the world
relevant to China’s innovation and economic
development goals (PwC & BAE Systems, 2017, p. 5). In
2017, PwC and BAE Systems uncovered the most
notable APT10 operation to date, dubbed Cloud
Hopper. The op primarily targeted managed IT services
providers
(MSPs),
which
allowed
APT10
“unprecedented potential access to the intellectual
property and sensitive data of those MSPs and their
clients globally” (PwC & BAE Systems, 2017, p. 4). On
August 15, 2018, Intrusion Truth revealed that APT10
was managed out the Tianjin bureau of the Chinese
Ministry of State Security (Intrusion Truth, 2018). Five
months later, the DoJ unsealed an indictment against
two APT10 members for “conspiracy to commit
computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud,
and aggravated identity theft” (US DoJ, 2018).
Dubbed Operation Aurora by security vendor
McAfee in January 2010, APT17 targeted at least 34
companies in the technology, financial and defense
sectors starting in late-2009 (Goodin, 2010). Using a
zero-day in Internet Explorer and “nearly a dozen
pieces of malware and several levels of encryption to
burrow deeply into the bowels of company networks,”
APT17 was “highly successful in obfuscating the attack
and avoiding common detection methods” (Zetter,
2010). Dmitri Alperovitch, then vice president of threat
research at McAfee, explained that "we have never
ever, outside of the defense industry, seen commercial
industrial companies come under that level of
sophisticated attack" (Zetter, 2010). On July 24, 2019,
Intrusion Truth offered proof that APT17 was run out of
the Jinan bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State
Security (Intrusion Truth, 2019a). Similar to Chinese
threat actor group APT41, APT17 also exhibited
hallmarks of financially motivated cybercriminal
operations (Lyngaas, 2019b). According to Intrusion
Truth, members of APT17 circulated a data for sale list
amongst the Chinese hacking community which also
included packages on Chinese citizens (Intrusion Truth,
2019b). As of this writing it is unclear whether the MSS
has lost control over APT17, or Intrusion Truth has lain
down a false flag to create friction between the MSS
and APT17.

19

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

Up until 2015, APT3 primarily targeted US and
UK-based aerospace, defense, telecommunications,
and transportation companies before shifting inward
and honing in on Hong Kong-based political targets
(Symantec, 2016). On May 9, 2017, Intrusion Truth
identified APT3 (Boyusec) as a Chinese contractor
working for the MSS (Intrusion Truth, 2017). Four
months later the US Department of Justice unsealed an
indictment against three Boyusec members for
“computer hacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy
and identity theft” (US DoJ, 2017). As of this writing,
Boyusec has not resurfaced.
At least four MSS connected teams have struck
targets in Japan.

APT10 has been active since at least 2009 and
has “historically targeted construction and engineering,
aerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the
United States, Europe, and Japan” (FireEye, n.d.).
After PwC and BAE Systems’ write-up on the
Cloud Hopper campaign in 2017, several security
vendors also reported other APT10 campaigns
conducted in the same year. According to a SCMP
article published in April 2018, FireEye identified two
APT10 campaigns against Japanese targets between
September and October 2017. Curiously the malware
used also included taunting lines of text, including such
gems as: “I’m here waiting for u,” “POWERED BY
APT632185, NORTH KOREA,” and “According to the
analysis report, some Japanese analysts have always
been portrayed as a bit of a joke” (SCMP, 2018).
In February 2019, Insikt Group and Rapid7
reported and attributed with “high confidence” an
APT10 campaign that took place between November
2017 and September 2018. According to the analysis,
the targets included Visma – “a billion-dollar
Norwegian [MSP] company with at least 850,000
customers globally” –, an international apparel
company, and a US law firm with “strong experience in
intellectual property law with clients in the
pharmaceutical, technology, electronics, biomedical,
and automotive sectors, among others” (Insikt Group &
Rapid7, 2019, p. 1). However, several security
researchers took issue with the attribution assessment.
Benjamin Koehl, an analyst at Microsoft’s Threat
Intelligence Center tweeted that, “this activity is not

APT10. It is all APT31 (or ZIRCONIUM) in our terms”
(Koehl, 2019). Similarly, Kris McConkey, head of
cyberthreat detection and response at PwC stated that
“none of the stuff that we were tracking as APT10
overlaps with what Recorded Future and Rapid7 have
reported” (Lyngaas, 2019a). Sean Lyngaas over at
Cyberscoop summarized the issue neatly by
highlighting that these attribution differences happen
quite regularly and that the lack of a standard
nomenclature to summarize patterns of unique
characteristics is a problem for identifying new threat
actors (Lyngaas, 2019a). As of this writing the
attribution debate in this case has not been resolved.
ChChes: On January 26, 2017, the Japan
Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination
Center (JP-CERT) reported the discovery of a new
malware/backdoor called ChChes, which was used in a
campaign against Japanese organizations since around
October 2016 (Nakamura, 2017). In February, Palo Alto
Network’s Unit 42 confirmed that the campaign
targeted “Japanese academics working in several areas
of science, along with Japanese pharmaceutical and a
US-based subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturing
organizations” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig, 2017). Palo
Alto also additionally explained that “the ChChes
samples […] were digitally signed using a certificate
originally used by HackingTeam and later part of the
data leaked when they [HackingTeam] were
themselves hacked” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig,
2017). 15 In July 2017 researchers at Trend Micro
connected ChChes to APT10 by noting that, “we first
saw ChChes set its sights on an organization that’s long
been a target of APT 10/menuPass. […] ChChes also
resembles another backdoor, Emdivi, which first made
waves in 2014. […] In one instance, we detected PlugX
and Emdivi on the same machine. This PlugX variant
connected to an APT 10/menuPass-owned domain, but
the packer is similar to that used by ChChes. While it’s
possible it was hit by two different campaigns, further
analysis told a different story. Both were compiled on
the same date, only several hours apart” (Sy et al.,
2017). It is highly likely that ChChes is not a new APT
group, but an APT10 sub-team.

15 HackingTeam is an Italian, Milan-based company specializing in
“offensive solutions for cyber investigations.” HT was breached in
July 2015 with more than 400GB of internal files dumped into the
public domain.

Targets
Japan: Governmental organizations, manufacturing, financial,
chemical, satellite, media, medical, food, and education
organizations.

In August 2015, Kaspersky’s GReAT team
released a blogpost on a new threat actor dubbed Blue
Termite, which was running a cyberespionage
campaign against “hundreds of organizations in Japan”
since at least 2012 (Kaspersky Lab, 2015). Among other
characteristics, Blue Termite stood out due to their
usage of a zero-day Flash exploit and “a sophisticated
backdoor, which [was] customized for each victim.” As
the team noted, “this was the first campaign known to
Kaspersky Lab that [was] strictly focused on Japanese
targets” (Kaspersky Lab, 2015).
Speaking at Code Blue in October 2015, Shusei
Tomonaga and Yuu Nakamaura over JP-CERT’s analysis
center, provided a detailed presentation on the Blue
Termite campaign. Among other items, they explained
that (a) the Emdivi malware used was repeatedly
upgraded, (b) in some cases, the targeted
organization’s proxy server address was hard-coded,
and that (c) each Emdivi version possibly only ran on
specific computers (encryption of data by computer
SID) (Tomonaga & Nakamura, 2015, slide 37).
According to Trend Micro, Emdivi appeared first in
2014 and is the most used remote access tool
leveraged against targets in Japan (Arai, 2015).
Symantec conducted its own investigation into
Blue Termite’s activity, which the company identified
as Operation CloudyOmega in November 2014. In
contrast to Kaspersky, Symantec started to look into
CloudyOmega’s activity because the group exploited a
zero-day in the popular Japanese word processing
software Ichitaro. Further investigation revealed that
“the attack was in fact part of an ongoing
cyberespionage campaign specifically targeting various
Japanese organization. […] variants of Backdoor.Emdivi
are persistently used as payload” (Symantec, 2014).
In terms of attribution, Kaspersky states that
“the graphic user interface of the Command and
Control server as well as some technical documents
related to the malware used in the Blue Termite
operation are written in Chinese” (Kaspersky Lab,
2015). Presenting at the 28th Annual First Conference in
Seoul in June 2016, Kakumaru et al. observed that (1)
97% of IP addresses possibly used by Blue
Termite/CloudyOmega, were assigned by an ISP in

Shanghai; (2) The group also made a mistake in one of
their attacks which exposed a one hour time difference
between the attacker’s local time and Japanese
Standard Time; And (3) the phishing documents were
written in a slightly different character font than the
original Japanese fonts (Kakumaru et al. 2016, slide 1723). Meanwhile, Symantec found tooling overlaps
between CloudyOmega and the Chinese APT group
Hidden Lynx and the creators of the LadyBoyle
backdoor (backdoor.boda) (Symantec, 2014; Symantec
2013).
Winnti group/Winnti Umbrella
Tooling
Proprietary: Winnti backdoor; ZxShell
Widely available: China Chopper; Metasploit; Cobaltstrike; PlugX;
PoisonIvy
Targets
Gaming companies in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam,
Europe, Russia, and the US; Pharmaceutical and telecommunication
companies; Tibetan and Chinese journalists, Uyghur and Tibetan
activists, China-focused foreign news organizations; The
government of Thailand

On April 11, 2013, Kaspersky published its report
on the original Winnti group, which stated that “this
group has been active for several years and specializes
in cyberattacks against the online video game industry”
(Kaspersky GReAT, 2013). In 2015, Winnti branched out
and started pivoting into other sectors, such as
targeting large holdings in the telecommunication
section and major pharmaceutical companies. In one
instance it even signed a driver “with a stolen
certificate of a division of a huge Japanese
conglomerate” (Tarakanov, 2015).
Over the years, security vendors have connected
Winnti infrastructure and tooling to other campaigns
and groups, which has led MITRE’s Att&ck database to
note that, “some reporting suggests a number of other
groups, including Axiom (APT13), APT17, and Ke3chang,
are closely linked to Winnti Group” (MITRE Att&ck,
n.d.). Other aliases and sub-teams include LEAD,
Barium, Wicked Panda, GREF, and PassCV (Hegel, 2018,
p. 4). Thus, nowadays, the name “Winnti” is primarily
used to refer to a custom backdoor used by teams
under the Winnti umbrella. On May 3, 2018,
ProtectWise 401TRG “assesse[d] with high confidence
that the Winnti umbrella is associated with the Chinese
state intelligence apparatus, with at least some
elements located in the Xicheng District in Beijing”
(Hegel, 2018, p. 3).
In terms of behavior, Winnti stands out for
simple operational security mistakes. As one source
explained to German broadcaster BR, “these hackers
don’t care if they’re found out or not. They care only
about achieving their goals" (Tanriverdi et al., 2019).
This characteristic stands in stark contrast to other

21

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

Chinese ATP teams which notably try to hide and cover
up their involvements.
According to Zhang and Ortolani over at Lastline,
“no new [Winnti] campaign has been publicly reported
after the one targeting German Pharmaceutical
companies in April 2019” (Zhang & Ortolani, 2019). On
December 6, 2019, the German Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution (BfV) released – for the
first time ever - a 19-page technical report, warning the
German private sector of the Winnti threat. According
to the report, the group started targeting German
companies back in 2016, and the BfV currently assumes
that Winnti is conducting a wave of persistent attacks
against the German economy (BfV 2019, p. 2).

5.4 Contractors
This sub-section lists three Chinese APT threat
actors that have targeted Japan assets, but so far have
not been directly linked to any of the aforementioned
groups. They are most likely Chinese contractors
working for the PLA or the MSS in one way or another.
Dust Storm
Tooling
Proprietary: Misdat backdoor (2010-2011); Mis-type hybrid
backdoor (2012); S-type backdoor (2013-2014); ZLIB backdoor
(2014-2015); Specially crafted HLP files; Several zero-days (CVE2011-0611, CVE-2012-1889, CVE-2014-0322, and maybe CVE 20135990)
Widely available: Poison Ivy, Gh0st RAT
Targets
Prior to 2015: Government and defense-related intelligence targets
(incl. US defense companies and Uyghur mailing lists)
Since 2015: Japanese critical infrastructure, including electricity
generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and
construction companies. Also, subdivisions of larger foreign
organizations

In February 2016, Cylance released a report on a
long-standing persistent threat it dubbed Operation
Dust Storm - which has been active since at least 2010.
While Cylance has not attributed any group or
individuals to the Dust Storm campaign, it did highlight
“a fairly large lull in activity from March -August 2013”
(Gross, 2016, p. 4). This coincides with APT1’s
downturn after Mandiant released its report on APT1 in
February 2013. Other breadcrumbs that point toward a
Chinese-based APT are the group’s past use of “public
RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st Rat,” as well as their
targeting of US defense companies and the Chinese
Uyghur ethnic minority (Gross, 2016, p. 2-4).
In 2015, Dust Storm veered away from
traditional
government
and
defense-related
intelligence targets and migrated to “seek out
organizations
involved
in
Japanese
critical
infrastructure and resources” (Gross, 2016, p. 1). By
2016 it almost entirely shifted to “specifically and

exclusively target Japanese companies or Japanese
subdivisions of larger foreign organizations” (Gross,
2016, p. 1). The group also “adopted and eventually
customized several Android backdoors,” and “rapidly
expanded their mobile operations in May 2015” (Gross,
2016, p. 6).
Sadly, Cylance also explained that “as the group
became more and more focused on Japan, less and less
of their tactics and malware appeared in reports or
write-ups” (Gross, 2016, p. 6). As far as open source is
concerned, no vendor has published any major report
on Dust Storm since.
Note: Some APT reports view Dust Storm as an
APT10 campaign. To this author it is unclear on what
information this attribution assessment is based on.
MITRE for example categorizes Dust Storm separate
from APT10, while Thales’ Cyberthreat Handbook
identifies Dust Storm as APT10’s first major campaign
ever (Thales & Verint, p. 38).
Stalker Panda
Tooling
Proprietary: ?
Widely available: Elirks, SharpServer, Blogspot RAT, XUni,
PowerShell scripts
Targets
Primarily political, media, and engineering sectors in Japan, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and the US

Very few public reports have been published on
the group known as Stalker Panda. The most important
document is an analysis written by Raytheon in August
2015 and published by WikiLeaks as part of the CIA’s
Vault 7 leak in March 2017.
According to Raytheon, “[Stalker Panda] appears
to have close ties to the Chinese National University of
Defense and Technology, which is possibly linked to the
PLA. Stalker Panda has been observed conducting
targeted attacks against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
the United States. The attacks appear to be centered
on political, media, and engineering sectors. The group
appears to have been active since around 2010 and
they maintain and upgrade their tools regularly”
(Raytheon, 2015, p. 1).
While CrowdStrike additionally notes, that
Stalker Panda ”is linked to BlogSpotRAT activity
targeting Japan in June 2017” (CrowdStrike, 2018, p.
26), Raytheon clearly highlights that “there is nothing
interesting, unique, or sophisticated about the Blogspot
RAT” (Raytheon, 2015, p. 1).
Maybe – and this is just speculation on the
authors part – Stalker Panda is a team comprised of
Chinese PLA students, rather than staffed by
professional PLA operators.

Icefog/Dagger Panda

5.5 Unsorted

Tooling
Several variants of the Icefog backdoor (Fucobha), HLP files, HWP
exploits, CVE-2012-1856 and CVE2012-0158
Targets
Primarily Japan and South Korea: government institutions, military
contractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom operators,
industrial and high-tech companies, and media outlets.

This section lists the most prominent Chinese
threat actors that have targeted Japanese entities, but
have so far not been identified as being part of, or
contractually connected to the PLA or the MSS. Minor
Chinese APTs targeting Japan that are not included in
this non-exhaustive list are APT16, EvilPost, and Axiom
APT/APT17 (Hidden Lynx’s DeputyDog campaign). 16

Icefog was a Chinese APT threat actor that was
active between 2011 and 2014. According to Kaspersky
it primarily focused on targets in Japan and South
Korea, including “governmental institutions, military
contractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom
operators, industrial and high-tech companies and
mass media” (Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 3). What made
Icefog stand out at the time were its hit-and-run
tactics. Meaning, the group avoided long-term
persistence within a network. It knew what it wanted
from a victim and abandoned the target as soon as they
had what they came for. Some analyst therefore
assume that Icefog were mercenaries for hire (Mimoso,
2013).
Minor convergence with APT1: Icefog liked to
use HLP files to infect their targets. Those HLP files did
not contain any exploits, but abused certain Windows
features to drop malware. As Kaspersky’s GReAT team
explains, “it’s interesting to know that Icefog is not the
only crew to heavily use HLP ‘exploits’ as part of their
toolkit. Well known, very effective APT like the
Comment Crew/APT1 have included the HLP trick in
their kits, along with other lesser known crews”
(Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 10).
In June 2019, senior FireEye researcher, Chi-en
(Ashley) Shen, showed that since 2014, several new
and updated Icefog malware strains were shared
among numerous threat actors - including Roaming
Tiger, APT15, Temp Group A, and suspected APT9 – to
hit targets in Europe, Russia, and Central Asia (Shen,
2019). Shen warned that, “shared malware is a pitfall
for attribution, we should not do attribution only based
on malware” (Shen, 2019). Overall, it seems that Icefog
followed the same trajectory as Winnti. Once
exclusively used by one Chinese APT, new versions of
the malware are now “shared among many different
APTs, each with its own agenda” (Cimpanu, 2019b).

Tick/Bronze Butler/REDBALDKNIGHT
Tooling
Proprietary: Daserf, Datper, xxmm, Mimzen, SymonLoader, Gofarer
and Homamdownloader
Widely available: Mimikatz, gsecdump
Targets
Primarily Japan and South Korea: government agencies; companies
in the biotechnology, electronics manufacturing, and industrial
chemistry sector; media and broadcasting organizations

The Tick espionage group has been active since
at least 2006, and most likely originates in the People’s
Republic of China (DiMaggio, 2016a). While Trick
primarily targets Japan and South Korea with its own
custom developed malware (Daserf), it has also
sporadically hit organizations in Russia, Singapore, and
even China itself.
According to Secureworks, The group is “able to
craft phishing emails in native Japanese and operating
successfully within a Japanese language environment”
(Secureworks, 2017). It has also demonstrated the
ability to identify a significant zero-day vulnerability
within a popular Japanese corporate tool and then use
scan-and-exploit techniques to indiscriminately
compromise Japanese internet-facing enterprise
systems. […] It has remained undetected in several
compromised networks for up to five years”
(Secureworks, 2017).
Tick stands out from the APT crowd in many
different ways. The group is “highly selective in its
approach and only appears to deploy its full range of
tools once it establishes that the compromised
organization is an intended target” (DiMaggio, 2016a).
It “frequently use[s] either privacy protection services
or domain brokers to mask registration information.
These tactics are used to make discovery and
attribution more difficult” (DiMaggio, 2016a). It was
also one of the few initial groups that leveraged
steganography within their attacks. Trend Micro
described one use case by explaining that, “a
downloader will be installed on the victim’s machine
and retrieve Daserf from a compromised site. Daserf
will then connect to another compromised site and
download an image file (i.e., .JPG, .GIF). The image is
embedded in either the encrypted backdoor

configurations or hacking tool. After their decryption,
Daserf will connect to its C&C and await further
commands” (Chen & Hsieh, 2017).
Curiously, in 2018, Palo Alto Network’s Unit 42
also discovered that Tick weaponized secure USB drives
in an older campaign to specifically target air-gapped
computers running out-of-support Windows systems.
While Unit 42 has no information on any active targets,
it did note that “air-gapped systems are common
practice in many countries for government, military,
and defense contractors, as well as other industry
verticals“ (Hayashi & Harbison, 2018).

Also: Seeking out victims in Tibet and Russia.

In September 2014, FireEye identified “two
distinct campaigns originating from different
geographic regions in China using similar tools,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs)” (Haq et al., 2014, p.
3). FireEye named the first group Moafee (after their
command and control infrastructure), and the second
group DragonOK (after an event name in one of their
payload executables). Moafee operated out of the
Guangdong province (HTran backend server location)
and targeted governments and military organizations
with national interests in the South China Sea.
DragonOK meanwhile appeared to operate out of
Jiangsu province (HTran backend server location) with a
focused interest for technology and manufacturing
companies located in Japan and Taiwan (Haq et al.,
2014, p. 17-19).
In April 2015, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42
identified a new DragonOK backdoor (called
FormerFirstRAT) that was deployed against Japanese
targets in at least five phishing campaigns. According to
the blogpost “all five phishing campaigns targeted a
Japanese manufacturing firm over the course of two
months, but the final campaign also targeted a
separate Japanese high-tech organization” (MillerOsborn & Grunzweig, 2015).
In January 2017, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42
observed a number of attacks by DragonOK against
individuals and organizations in Japan and Taiwan, but
also against targets in Tibet and Russia (Grunzweig,
2017). Unit 42 summarized its findings by highlighting
that “the DragonOK group are quite active and
continue updating their tools and tactics. Their toolset
is being actively developed to make detection and

analysis more difficult. Additionally, they appear to be
using additional malware toolsets such as TidePool”
(Grunzweig, 2017).
In June 2017, government servers in Cambodia
were targeted by a new remote access Trojan dubbed
KHRAT. In an article by The Phnom Penh Post, Phnom
Penh-based
cybersecurity
researcher
Niklas
Femerstrand is quoted as saying that “the DragonOK
campaign has previously targeted organizations in
Taiwan, Japan, Tibet and Russia, and political
organizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017”
(Sassoon & Taing). On October 27, 2017, Ryan Olsen,
Director of Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks,
was interviewed on the cyberwire podcast on the
specific topic of the KHRAT. According to Olsen,
“[KHRAT] is a malware tool--that's a Remote Access
Tool or a Remote Access Trojan, depending on your
terminology--that we associate with a group that's
called DragonOK” (Bittner, 2017). 17
Budminer/Taidoor
Tooling
Proprietary: Dripion custom backdoor; Blugger downloader
Widely available: Taidoor Trojan
Taidoor Trojan connected Targets
Since 2008 (Taidoor trojan): government agencies; media, financial,
telecom and manufacturing sectors in Taiwan, Japan, US, South
Korea (Doherty & Krysiuk, n.d.).
Since 2011: (Taidoor Trojan): shifted to target think tanks
(Symantec, 2012b)
Since 2015 (Dripion backdoor): Taiwan, Brazil, US (DiMaggio, 2016b)

Open source information is sparse on the
Budminer APT. The Symantec website only returns two
search hits on the group, and neither MISP nor MITRE
list Budminer among any of their APT groups.
Symantec stumbled upon Budminer in August
2015 when it received three file hashes that had “the
functionality of a back door with information stealing
capabilities.” The malware also appeared to be “new,
rarely detected, and not publicly available,” leading
Symantec to realize that it was custom-developed
malware they termed Dripion. Meaning, there was a
very high likelihood that Dripion was tied to a
cyberespionage campaign.
The downloader was identified as Blugger,
which is not publicly available and has only been seen
used by China-based threat actors. As DiMaggio noted,
“this is the first time we have seen Blugger used to
deliver malware other than Taidoor” (DiMaggio,
2016b).
Taidoor meanwhile is a malware that has been
used in many other cyberespionage campaigns since at
17 Note: Although often linked to in most of the reporting on the
KHRAT-DragonOK connection, the Palo Alto’s write-up on KHAT of
August 2017 (Hinchliffe & Miller-Osborn, 2017) does in fact not
mention DragonOK at all.

24

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

least 2008. Further investigation uncovered that “one
of the Blugger samples associated with Dripion
connected with a root domain also used in Taidoorrelated activity” against targets in Taiwan, Japan, South
Korea, and the US (DiMaggio, 2016b). According to a
2019 report by Macnica Networks, Taidoor was
extensively used against Japanese telecommunication
companies (including telecommunication hardware
manufacturers) between the end of 2017 and June
2018. The report speculates that the Taidoor attacks
were aimed at obtaining personal customer and
infrastructure information for future operations
(Macnica Networks, 2019, p. 8).
Note: Given the sparse sourcing, it is
not clear to this author when Budminer was first
identified. None of Symantec’s extensive write-ups on
Taidoor ever mention the group, and none of the other
major security vendors seem to have designated an
APT based on the Dripion backdoor, Blugger use, and
Taidoor connection. It is also unclear as to how
extensive Budminer is connected to the overall Taidoor
deployments against Japanese targets.

6 Effects
6.1 Social effects
Since the MHI breach in 2011, the Japanese
government has made increasing efforts to change the
cyber security culture in Japan. While the country is still
struggling with non-transparent incident reporting and
a perception that admitting to a breach is a sign of
weakness and shame, there have been noticeable
changes in attitude (Phneah, 2013).
In 2011, Japanese government officials were
furious when they learned of the MHI breach through
the media rather than the company reporting the
incident immediately to the Ministry of Defense. Given
that this was the first publicly known case of a Japanese
defense contractor having been breached, one could –
with a large stretch of imagination - argue that MHI
was simply not familiar with the reporting mechanisms
or did not deem the incident relevant enough to
activate it. Then minister of defense Yasuo Ichikawa put
it most diplomatically by stating that “the ministry has
business ties with the company, so we will instruct it to
review its information control systems” (McCurry,
2011). According to the New York Times, the MHI
breach also fueled concerns in Washington on whether
Tokyo is able to handle delicate information. As the
Times explained, the MHI breach came “less than two
weeks after a Japanese air traffic controller was
questioned for posting American flight information on
his blog” – including detailed flight plans for Air Force
One and data on a US military reconnaissance drone
(Tabuchi, 2011).
Despite MHI’s assertions that no confidential
information was exfiltrated, the Asahi Shimbun
reported on October 24, that the attackers “likely
netted military data on warplanes and information on
nuclear power plants” (Reuters, 2011). To date it
remains unclear whether sensitive defense information
was leaked.
In contrast to the MHI’s public relations fiasco,
the breach of the Japanese Pension Service (JPS) in May
2015 was discernably different. Between May 8 and
May 20, 2015, the JPS received 124 suspicious emails
that infected five computers and spread to 26 others.
In the period of May 21-23, the data of approximately
1.25 million enrolled citizens was exfiltrated. On May
28, the infections were discovered, and on June 1 the
JPS apologized in a televised press conference for
having been breached. According to the JPS statement,
they immediately reported the incident to the police
and requested an investigation, hired an anti-virus
company to analyze and contain the malware, and
blocked all JPS network connections to the internet
(JPS, 2015, p. 2). In addition, JPS also set up a system to
inform each customer individually on whether their

25

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

data was affected, and set up a hotline for reporting
any suspicious phishing activities related to customer
pension information (JPS, 2015, p. 2). According to the
Mainichi Shimbun, the Metropolitan Police Department
(MPD)'s Public Security Bureau investigated the case
but was stymied by the culprit’s use of Tor (Kanamori,
2018). Three years after the breach – on May 20, 2018 Japanese law enforcement officially closed the criminal
investigation without any results. To date none of the
records exfiltrated from the JPS have been used for
malicious purposes. In the aftermath of the JPS breach,
the active sharing of indicators of compromise led
numerous other companies and government agencies
to report similar breaches in their networks.
Despite the JPS ‘success’ story, the norm still
seems to be that after each incident, Japanese
government officials first reassure the public that no
confidential information was leaked, and then walk
back their statements because the investigation either
showed otherwise, or the affected agency/company
has no idea what was actually lost. Similarly, it is quite
disturbing to note that the more narrowly focused an
attacker is on Japan, the less and less technical
information becomes publicly available on the attacker.
Meaning, communicating with the Japanese public and
the global security community at large still seems to be
a very low priority for Japanese security vendors,
companies, and government agencies alike (Gross,
2016, p. 6).
Fitting into this gaping hole of public relations
building was the appointed of Yoshitaka Sakurada to
the post of deputy chief of the government’s
cybersecurity strategy office. Sakurada inevitable
achieved global fame in November 2018 when he
admitted in the Japanese Parliament that he never
used a computer in his professional life and
“appear[ed] confused by the concept of a USB drive”
(McCurry, 2018). As opposition lawmaker Masato Imai
pointedly put it, “it’s unbelievable that someone who
has not touched computers is responsible for
cybersecurity policies” (McCurry, 2018).
The preparations for the Tokyo Olympics in
2020 have nonetheless discernably impacted the
government’s motivation to pro-actively secure Japan
in cyberspace. In fact, the Japanese government has
taken the unusual step of allowing the Japanese
National Institute for Information and Communications
Technology (NICT) to run dictionary attacks against the
country’s 200 million Internet of Things devices starting
in February 2019. 18 While the overall purpose of this
18 Dictionary attacks: A brute-force attack based on selecting
potential passwords from a pre-prepared list. The attacker creates a
“dictionary” of the most likely sequences of characters and uses a
malicious program to check them all in turn in the hope of finding a
match. A special type of dictionary attack uses a list of possible
password templates and automatically generates a variable

‘campaign’ is to collect data for a survey on default and
easy-to-guess device passwords, the government’s plan
also includes measures to alert vulnerable customers
and help them to secure their devices (Cimpanu,
2019a).
Apart from these broader security issues, there
are still numerous attack vectors that remain unique to
Japan. Kaoru Hayashi over at Palo Alto Network’s Unit
42, highlighted one curious case in his blog post on July
24, 2017, involving the Tick group. According to
Hayashi, “many Japanese companies introduced a file
encryption system for secure data exchange over
email. The system encrypts documents with a userspecified password and often creates a self-extracting
(SFX) file for ease of decrypting the file to recipients.
When sending the SFX file with a password by email,
senders usually rename the file extension from .exe to
something else to avoid blocking or detecting the
attachment by an email gateway or security product”
(Hayashi, 2017). For an adversary that knows how
Japanese enterprise users exchange these emails it is a
very easy task to craft a spear phishing email that
exploit this attack vector.

6.2 Economic effects
It is not clear what actual effects the cyberrelated incidents attributed to Chinese threat actors
had on the Japanese economy. While there are a few
publicly available figures on remediation costs - such as
the JPS breach standing at roughly $8 million USD - and
on the quantity of exfiltrated sensitive documents,
quantifying these damages in a reliable manner is not
possible.
To a certain degree Japan’s unique threat
landscape has been impacting the country’s economy
each year around September 18 - the anniversary of
the Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese invasion
of Manchuria and the establishment of the puppet
state of Manchukuo. While Chinese nationalist
hacktivist have been mobilizing DDoS attacks and
defacements against Japanese targets in September
rather regularly over the past decade, activity has
notably settled down over recent years. Despite this
trend, the Japanese ISP provider Internet Initiative
Japan rightfully warns that “some [Chinese] cyber
attacks are linked to real-life historical events and carry
a historical context, so it is necessary to pay attention
to political and social situations such as historically
significant dates and current international affairs”
(Saito, 2016, p. 5).

component. For example, based on information about the victim’s
name, an attacker can test the password denisXXX, substituting XXX
for the numbers 001 to 999 (see: Kaspersky IT Encyclopedia, n.d.)

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

6.3 Technological effects
The onslaught of Chinese attacks against
Japanese infrastructure has in part forced the Abe
government to outsource the MoD’s development of
offensive cyber capabilities to one or several unnamed
private Japanese companies in 2019 (Tokyo-np, 2019).
While there are certainly legal hurdles that will still
have to be pushed aside, the Japanese government
already tried to outsource the development of a ‘seek
and destroy’ malware to Fujitsu back in 2012 (Leyden,
2012). Open sources are not entirely clear as to
whether the Fujitsu malware failed to produce the
expected results or why exactly the product was
shelved in end. It is anyone’s best guess how the 2019
plan will work out. According to the Japan Times, the
delivery date for the offensive cyber capability is set for
March 2020 (Japan Times, 2019).
In terms of the heaps of documents that were
exfiltrated by Chinese APTs over the years from every
industrial sector in Japan, it is unclear as to how or
whether they benefitted companies and research
institutions in China. Quantifying this impact would
necessitate insights into what documents were stolen,
how they were disseminated in China, and whether
they were actual useful. No such assessment can be
made in this report.

Given the concerns of industrial espionage at
home and Beijing’s global ambitions abroad, the
Japanese Ministry of Telecommunications also
effectively blocked Huawei and ZTE from competing in
Japan’s 5G infrastructure build-up by allocating the 5G
spectrum to Japanese telecommunications companies
upon the condition that they “take sufficient
cybersecurity measures including responding to supply
chain risk” (Nussey & Shida, 2019). Japan’s ban
essentially follows similar policies enacted in 2018 by
the US, Australia, and New Zealand.
In the context of the US-Japan military alliance,
US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo stated on April 19,
2019 that, "the United States and Japan affirmed that
international law applies in cyberspace and that a
cyberattack could, in certain circumstances, constitute
an armed attack under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty. We stressed the need to work together
to
protect
classified
information,
maintain
technological superiority, and preserve our shared
defense and economic advantages from theft and
exploitation" (Pompeo, 2019). As of this writing it is
unclear whether Tokyo has negotiated any special
arrangements with Washington within the context of
persistent engagement/defending forward. 19

6.4 International effects
On December 21, 2018, the Japanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs joined the Five Eyes’ collective public
attribution effort on APT10. According to the statement
by Press Secretary Takeshi Osuga, “Japan has identified
continuous attacks by the group known as APT10 to
various domestic targets including private companies
and academic institutions and expresses resolute
condemnation of such attacks. […] Japan will continue
to closely cooperate with the international community
and make efforts in order to ensure a free, fair and
secure cyberspace” (MOFA, 2018). It is important to
note that, apart from the Five Eyes, Japan was the only
country that released a written statement. The
Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, and Demark merely
tweeted their support, while the German government
only comment on APT10 when a government
spokesperson was specifically asked by a journalist at
the Federal Press Conference on Dec 21.
Meanwhile, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs continues to argue that Beijing has nothing to
do with APT10, noting on December 21 that, “the U.S.
side making unwarranted criticisms of China in the
name of so-called ‘cyber stealing’ is blaming others
while oneself is to be blamed, and is self-deception.
China absolutely cannot accept this” (Wen, 2018).

19 For a description of persistent engagement see: US Cyber
Command, 2018, p. 6

A one-sided Affair: Japan and the PRC in Cyberspace

7 Future Outlook
Beijing has a clearly defined grand strategy in
cyberspace, covering everything from ‘informatization’
and state-sovereignty to techno-nationalism and cyberdefense. Japan in contrast, has not yet articulated any
grand ambitions to define its place in the world of
tomorrow, nor how it will defend itself in and across
cyberspace against an increasingly assertive China.
If the Japanese government is able and willing to
significantly overhaul its defense policy and
constitutional maneuverability – and maybe even
attempt to walk in lock-step with the US strategy of
persistent engagement – we might witness an intense
competition between Tokyo and Beijing in cyberspace.
If however the Japanese government is unable to turn
around the current one-sided onslaught, then Tokyo
might become a liability to US alliance cooperation,
intelligence sharing, and possibly even power
projection across the Indo-Pacific over time.
In the long run, it is highly likely that Tokyo will
not to be able to merely hedge its alliance
commitments through the modernization of its
conventional military assets. Japan’s military absence in
the cyber domain will be felt in Washington one way or
the other.
For Beijing the primary challenge in the short
term is to push hard against any signs that US Cyber
Command is operationally applying persistent
engagement in the Indo-Pacific. Meaning, Beijing has to
walk a tight rope between, on the one hand, continuing
its industrial- and military espionage against Japanese
firms and government agencies. While on the other
hand, staying clear of any activities that could even
remotely undermine Japan’s democratic discourse,
push Tokyo into militarizing cyber space, or heighten
concerns in Washington to such a degree that it will
force US Cyber Command to pay significant attention to
the Indo-Pacific.
In the long run, Beijing’s will most likely seek to
significantly undermine the trust relationship between
Tokyo and Washington. Depending on the relative
intelligence gains that Beijing can extract from Tokyo
over time, China might run the Russian playbook on
information warfare against Japan in the not so distant
future.
