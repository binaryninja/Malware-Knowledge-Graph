Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and
the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF). The malware variant, known as Zebrocy, has been used by a sophisticated cyber actor. CISA and
CNMF are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested
response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
Two Windows executables identified as a new variant of the Zebrocy backdoor were submitted for analysis. The file is designed to allow a
remote operator to perform various functions on the compromised system.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch),
and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation. For more information on malicious cyber activity, please visit
https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov.

Description

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language. The file has been identified as a new variant of the
Zebrocy backdoor. The file takes an argument that is supposed to be an Exclusive OR (XOR) and hexadecimal encoded Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) or it can run using a plaintext URI.
Displayed below is a sample plaintext argument used by the malware:
--Begin arguments-Domain: malware.exe <Domain>
or
IP: malware.exe <IP address:Port>
--End arguments-When executed, it will encrypt the URI using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-128 Electronic Code Book (ECB) algorithm with a key
generated from the victim's hostname. The encrypted data is hexadecimal encoded and stored into
"%AppData%\Roaming\Personalization\EUDC\Policies\3030304332393839394630353537343934453244.”
It also collects information about the victim’s system such as username, 6 bytes of current user’s Security Identifiers (SID), and time of
infection. The data is encrypted and hexadecimal encoded before being exfiltrated using the predefined URI:

Description

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable written using Golang programming language. The file has been identified as new variant of the
Zebrocy backdoor. The file takes an argument that is supposed to be an XOR and hexadecimal encoded URI. The file cannot run using a
plaintext URI as compared to the other Zebrocy backdoor binary "ba9c59783b52b93aa6dfd4cfffc16f2b". This file and
ba9c59783b52b93aa6dfd4cfffc16f2b have similar functions.
When executed, it will encrypt the URI using AES-128 ECB algorithm with a key generated from the victim's hostname. The encrypted data is
hexadecimal encoded and stored into
"%AppData%\Roaming\UserData\Multimedia\Policies\3030304332393839394630353537343934453244".
It also collects information about the victim’s system such as username, 6 bytes of current user’s SID, and time of infection. The data is
encrypted and hexadecimal encoded before exfiltrated using the predefined URI.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their
organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid
unwanted impacts.

4/5

Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group
unless required.
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the
file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Special Publication 800-83, "Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops".
