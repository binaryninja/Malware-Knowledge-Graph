KillDisk Variant Hits Latin American Finance Industry

June 7, 2018

In January, we saw a variant of the disk-wiping KillDisk malware hitting several financial
institutions in Latin America. One of these attacks was related to a foiled heist on the
organization’s system connected to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication’s (SWIFT) network.
Last May, we uncovered a master boot record (MBR)-wiping malware in the same region.
One of the affected organizations was a bank whose systems were rendered inoperable for
several days, thereby disrupting operations for almost a week and limiting services to
customers. Our analysis indicates that the attack was used only as a distraction — the end
goal was to access the systems connected to the bank’s local SWIFT network.
The telltale sign was a problem related to the affected machine’s boot sector. Based on the
error message it displayed after our tests, we were able to ascertain that this was another —
possibly new — variant of KillDisk. This kind of notification is common in systems affected by
MBR-wiping threats and not in other malware types such as ransomware, which some
people initially believed to be the culprit. Trend Micro products detect this threat as
TROJ_KILLMBR.EE and TROJ_KILLDISK.IUE.

The nature of this payload alone makes it difficult to determine if the attack was motivated by
an opportunistic cybercriminal campaign or part of a coordinated attack like the previous
attacks we observed last January.

Initial analysis
We were able to source a sample that may be the malware involved in the May 2018 attacks.
We ran it, and it broke the boot sector as expected (see Figure 1). An initial analysis of the
file revealed it was created using Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), an open-source
application used to create setup programs. The actor behind this threat used the application
and purposely named it “MBR Killer.” Although the sample was protected by VMProtect (a
virtualization protector used to defend against reverse engineering), we were still able to
verify that it has a routine that wipes the first sector of the machine’s physical disk, as shown
in Figure 2. We haven’t found any other new or notable routines in the sample we have.
There is no evident command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure or communication, or
ransomware-like routines coded into the sample. There are no indications of network-related
behavior in this malware.

How the malware wipes the affected machine’s disk
The malware was designed to wipe all the physical hard disks it can find in the infected
system. Here’s a summary of how it performs its MBR-wiping routine:
1. It uses the application programming interface (API) CreateFileA to
\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 to retrieve the handle of the hard disk.
2. It overwrites the first sector of the disk (512 bytes) with "0x00". The first sector is the
disk’s MBR.
3. It will try to perform the routines above (steps 1-2) on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1,
\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2, \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE3, and so on, as long as a hard disk is
available.
4. It will then force the machine to shut down via the API ExitWindows.
When calling the APIs, the main executable will drop the component file %User Temp%/ns{5
random characters}.tmp/System.dll. The main executable will then load the dynamic-link
library (DLL) file, which has the export function “Call” used to call for the APIs.
Mitigation and best practices
2/4

The destructive capabilities of this malware, which can render the affected machine
inoperable, underscore the significance of defense in depth: arraying security to cover each
layer of the organization’s IT infrastructure, from gateways and endpoints to networks and
servers. Here are some best practices that organizations can adopt to defend against this
kind of threat:
Identify and address security gaps. Regularly patch and update networks, systems,
and programs/applications to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Create strict patch
management policies and consider virtual patching, especially for legacy systems.
Regularly back up data and safeguard its integrity.
Secure mission-critical infrastructure. Secure the infrastructure used to store and
manage personal and corporate data. For financial institutions, SWIFT has a Customer
Security Programme that provides mandatory and advisory controls for their local
SWIFT infrastructure. Some of these include virtual patching, vulnerability scanning,
application control, and integrity monitoring of SWIFT-related applications.
Enforce the principle of least privilege. Restrict access to mission-critical data.
Network segmentation limits user or program access to the network; data
categorization organizes data by importance to minimize further exposure to threats or
breaches. Restrict access to and use of tools reserved for system administrators (for
example, PowerShell, command-line tools) to prevent them from being abused. Disable
outdated and unneeded system or application components.
Proactively monitor online premises. Deploy additional security mechanisms to
further hinder attackers. Firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems help
against network-based attacks, while application control and behavior monitoring
prevent the execution of suspicious and unwanted files or malicious routines. URL
categorization also helps prevent access to malware-hosting sites.
Foster a culture of cybersecurity. Many threats rely on social engineering to
succeed. Awareness of the telltale signs of spam and phishing emails, for instance,
significantly helps thwart email-based threats.
Create a proactive incident response strategy. Complement defensive measures
with incident response strategies that provide actionable threat intelligence and insights
to help IT and information security teams actively hunt for, detect, analyze, correlate,
and respond to threats.
