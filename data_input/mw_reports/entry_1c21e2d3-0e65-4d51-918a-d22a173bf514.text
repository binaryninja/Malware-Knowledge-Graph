LokiBot - The first hybrid Android malware
threatfabric.com/blogs/lokibot_the_first_hybrid_android_malware.html

Abstract
Lately we have been seeing a new variant of Android banking malware which is welldeveloped and provides numerous unique features such as a ransomware module. Based
on the BTC addresses that are used in the source code it seems that the actors behind this
new Android malware are successful cybercriminals with over 1.5 million dollars in BTC.

Bitcoin wallet details
It is very unlikely that the actors behind Android LokiBot have gained this amount of money
using only LokiBot since the requested fee for ransomware is between $70 and $100 and the
bot counts in the various campaigns we have seen is usually around 1000. The malware is
sold as a kit. A full license including updates costs $2000 in BTC. The main attack vector of
the malware is showing phishing overlays on a large amount of banking apps (often around
100) and a handful of other popular apps such as Skype, Outlook and WhatsApp. The
ransomware stage is activated when victims disable the administrative rights of the malware

or try to uninstall it. Besides the automatic activation of the ransomware module the bot also
has a “Go_Crypt” command, enabling the actors to trigger it. The ransomware attack
however does not seem to be the main focus of their campaign at the time of writing.

Malware characteristics
LokiBot, which works on Android 4.0 and higher, has pretty standard malware capabilities,
such as the well-known overlay attack all bankers have. It can also steal the victim’s contacts
and read and send SMS messages. It has a specific command to spam all contacts with
SMS messages as a means to spread the infection. The victim’s browser history isn’t safe
either, as this can be uploaded to the C2. To top it off there is an option to lock the phone
preventing the user from accessing it.
LokiBot also has some more unique features. For one it has the ability to start the victim’s
browser app and open a given web page. Additionally, it implements SOCKS5, can
automatically reply to SMS messages and it can start a user’s banking application. Combine
this with the fact that LokiBot can show notifications which seem to come from other apps,
containing for example a message that new funds have been deposited to the victim’s
account and interesting phishing attack scenarios arise! The phishing notifications use the
original icon of the application they try to impersonate. In addition, the phone is made to
vibrate right before the notification is shown so the victim will take notice of it. When the
notification is tapped it will trigger an overlay attack.
Another very interesting and unique feature of LokiBot is its ransomware capabilities. This
ransomware triggers when you try to remove LokiBot from the infected device by revoking its
administrative rights. It won’t go down without a fight and will encrypt all your files in the
external storage as a last resort to steal money from you, as you need to pay Bitcoins to
decrypt your files.
What’s also interesting to note is that the malware obfuscates its network traffic in the exact
same way as we’ve seen in previously discovered Bankbot variants. This is probably also the
reason why our great friend Nikolaos Chrysaidos (Head of Mobile Threats & Security at
Avast) has reported very early stages of lokibot campaign as Bankbot.

Panel features
The C2 web panel is well rounded and has a couple of interesting features. It provides you
with a built-in APK builder which allows you to customize the icon, name, build date and C2
URL, making it trivial to create numerous different samples targeting different user groups. It
will also automatically generate certificate to sign each APK.
In addition to building the APK an actor can also customize all aspects of the overlays which
will be shown to the victims and do advanced searches on all collected data, such as logs,
history and geolocation.

Ransomware details
The ransomware stage is automatically activated when victims tries to remove the malware.
In addition, it can be activated from the C2 by sending the “Go_Crypt” command.

Automatic ransomware activation when disabling ‘device admin’
As soon as the ransomware is activated, it starts searching for all files and directories in the
primary shared or external storage directory (traditionally the SD card) and encrypts them
using AES. The key is generated randomly under default AES/ECB/PKCS5 padding and
128-bit key size. However, the encryption function in this ransomware utterly fails, because
even though the original files are deleted, the encrypted file is decrypted and written back to
itself. Thus, victims won’t lose their files, they are only renamed.
Even though the encryption part fails pretty badly, the screen locker still works and will lock
the victim’s screen using the administrative permissions it has gained from the user when the
malware was first started. A threat is then shown on the screen: “Your phone is locked for

3/7

viewing child pornography.” The payment amount varies between $70 and $100. The Bitcoin
addresses of LokiBot are hardcoded in the APK and can’t be updated from C2 server.

Dynamic analysis evasion
The techniques used by LokiBot to prevent dynamic analysis are not very advanced, but
seem to be more extensive than those used by other banking malware we have seen. Over
time we see continueing improvements on this part, indicating the developer is still working
on this. The following techniques are found in the latest version of LokiBot:
- Detecting Qemu files: /dev/socket/qemud, /dev/qemu_pipe,
/system/lib/libc_malloc_debug_qemu.so, /sys/qemu_trace, /system/bin/qemu-props; Detecting Qemu properties: init.svc.qemud, init.svc.qemu-props, qemu.hw.mainkeys; -

Detecting emulator (goldfish) drivers in /proc/tty/drivers; - Checking installed packages for
TaintDroid package org.appanalysis; - Checking prescence of TaintDroid class
dalvik.system.Taint.

Conclusion
Since early this summer we have seen at least 30 to 40 samples with bot counts varying
between 100 to 2000 bots. We believe that the actors behind LokiBot are successful, based
on their BTC traffic and regular bot updates. In fact, we have seen new features emerge in
the bot almost every week which shows that LokiBot is becoming a strong Android trojan,
targeting many banks and popular apps.
