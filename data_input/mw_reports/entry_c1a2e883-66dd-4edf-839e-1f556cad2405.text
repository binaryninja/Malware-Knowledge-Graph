The ASEC analysis team recently discovered that a threat actor has been using Nitol DDoS
Bot to install Amadey. Amadey is a downloader that has been in circulation since 2018, and
besides extorting user credentials, it can also be used for the purpose of installing additional
malware.
Amadey is being actively distributed again this year, and even until very recently, it has been
propagating itself on websites disguised as cracks and keygens for normal software and
installing other malware on the infected systems.[1] Additionally, in the second half of this
year, Amadey was used in attacks involving LockBit 3.0, which targeted Korean corporate
users. Amadey was distributed as attachments to spam emails and was responsible for
installing LockBit Ransomware.[2]
While monitoring the actively distributed Amadey Bot, the ASEC analysis team found the
Nitol DDoS Bot malware installing Amadey. Nitol is a DDoS Bot with a Denial of Service
(DDoS) attack feature, and while its numbers have decreased recently, it is a malware that
has been steadily used in attacks since long ago. For example, in 2021, there was a history
of it being uploaded to a Korean forum archive, infecting many Korean users.[3]

Nitol Malware that installed Amadey is the same file as the malware covered in the above
blog post. This tells us that even after over a year, it is still being used in attacks up until now.
This file is being shared via torrent, disguised as cracks for Hancom and MS Office, and it is
infecting many users even at the current moment. The following are the names of paths
where Nitol was detected.

\microsoft office 2016\setup.exe
\SketchUp Pro 2018\crack.exe

Nitol Malware Analysis
Nitol used in the attacks was packed with Themida to hinder analysis. Nitol is a DDoS Bot
that supports various forms of DDoS attacks, and the one used in the attacks has 0x50 for its
settings data. When it communicates with C&C servers, it stands by for 5 seconds and sets
the system’s hidden files and folders to be invisible. The following is the settings data for
Nitol.

Table 1. Nitol settings data
The virtual environment check uses the IN command to check whether it is running on a
VMware virtual machine. As for sandbox environments, it checks whether the “api_log.dll”
and “SbieDll.dll” DLLs are loaded. If it confirms that it’s in a virtual or sandbox environment,
Nitol is shut down.
The dummy packet-generating option creates a random IP address and attempts to connect
by matching the port number of an actual C&C address. When this process is successful,
dummy data is transmitted. These behaviors are repeated 10 times, and it is likely that this is
for the purpose of hindering network behavior analysis.
As the option that excludes the installation process is not activated in this malware, an
installation process runs when the malware is executed. The installation process includes a
self-copying stage where the malware copies itself under a random 6-character name in
%APPDATA%, and a persistence maintaining stage where it uses the reg command to
register itself to the Run key. When the installation process is complete, it executes the
malware in the copied path and connects to the C&C server.
> “C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe” ADD
“HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” /V “My App” /t REG_SZ
/F /D “C:\Users\vmuser\AppData\Roaming\gkqske.exe”
Currently, access to the C&C server is unavailable, but once the connection is successfully
established, the malware transmits basic information about the infected system, as shown
below.

When Nitol sends the infected system’s information to the C&C server, the server returns the
command. The command can perform various functions including DDoS attacks,
downloading files, and running updates. For reference, DDoS attacks were divided into three
categories below, but the malware supports many more types of DDoS attacks.

Table 3. Commands that can be performed by Nitol
Out of the commands, there is one that receives a URL from the C&C server and connects to
the corresponding web page using Internet Explorer. The command can be configured to
access the web page unknown to the user or have Internet Explorer pop up to have users be
aware.

Additionally, there is also a command that changes MBR to incapacitate the system after a
reboot. When the system is restarted after the following data is written on MBR, it shows the
string “Game Over” as shown below and makes the system unable to reboot.

Nitol supports a command that downloads additional payloads, and this command was used
to install Amadey Bot. The following are ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) infrastructure logs
that show Nitol having downloaded Amadey from an external address.

Installing Additional Payloads Using Amadey (Amadey Bot, njRAT)
After being installed by Nitol, Amadey Bot attempts to connect to C&C servers. When this
process is successful, Amadey downloads a plugin responsible for extorting information to
collect information from the infected system and send them to the C&C server. Besides
account credentials, Amadey also takes periodic screenshots and sends them to the C&C
server. The following blog post goes into a detailed analysis of Amadey.

Figure 8. Amadey’s network traffic
An examination of the current version of Amadey shows that it receives a command from the
C&C server to install additional payloads, and accordingly, it downloads and installs a total of
4 files. These files are Amadey, Nitol, and a downloader, The Nitol mentioned above is Type
A, but Amadey also installs Nitol Type B.
TeamViewerSetupx64.exe : Amadey
TeamViewer_Desktop.exe : Nitol Type A
explorer.exe : Nitol Type B
ServiceManager.exe : Downloader (Dotnet Packer)

The top-level list of the addresses where the malware are downloaded from is unavailable,
but it can be assumed that there are various other malware strains aside from those
mentioned.

The malware installed by the threat actor mimic original programs, with names such as
TeamViewer, Explorer, and AnyDesk. The threat actor not only disguises the filename but
also the icons to resemble the original programs when distributing the malware.

Figure 10. Icons of malware used in attacks
Torrent is the main platform used in malware propagation alongside file-sharing sites. When
installing cracks or keygen files of commercial software using torrents, there is a risk of being
infected with malware disguised as these programs. When Nitol is installed, the user PC acts
as a DDoS Bot and can be used in DDoS attacks. In addition, it can also be used for
installing additional malware such as Amadey. As for Amadey, it stays in the infected system
to not only extort user credentials but also install additional malware.
Users should apply the latest patch for OS and programs such as Internet browsers, and
update V3 to the latest version to prevent malware infection in advance.
