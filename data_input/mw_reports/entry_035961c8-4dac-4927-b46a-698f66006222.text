Emotet is a banking trojan that topped the list for most widely seen malware in 2021. Similar
to some of my previous posts, Emotet is usually delivered via phishing campaign. In this blog
post we'll cover some initial .xlsm analysis and extract useful IOCs.

If you're interested in learning how to set up an environment and replicate some of this
activity, check out my "Cracking the Malware Pi√±ata" series here.

INITIAL ANALYSIS

Running exiftool, we get the following information from the sample:

On the exiftool output, we see that this is an XLSM file type. XLSM files, according to
Microsoft, are Excel Macro-Enabled Workbooks. Macros allow for the automation of tasks
within Microsoft Office documents, and this file extension and type applies specifically to
those documents compatible with Microsoft Excel.

TOOL GEARED TOWARDS MACROS

While we can absolutely use zipdump and have some findings, olevba proves to be more
successful in this specific circumstance. Developed by Decalage, olevba parses Microsoft
OLE2 files. In simple terms, OLE2 files serve as structured storage for linked objects and
embedded objects. This tool interacts with files in this format to extract the necessary data
for analysis.

Below are screenshots of the olevba tool at work:

There's a lot of information here. We see that the macro calls out to 3 different domains with
the intent of downloading a file. The file has an .ocx extension, meaning it is used as an
ActiveX control and, once configured, can steal information from the browser, download
additional files, amongst other malicious behaviors.

We see the DllRegisterServer function, which is typically used with the regsvr32.exe binary
but can also be leveraged by rundll32.exe, shown in olevba's output. According to Microsoft,
the DllRegisterServer function "instructs an in-process server to create its registry entries for
all classes supported." In this instance, it is being used to register the ActiveX controls and
bypass application controls in the process.

At the bottom of the olevba output, we see a reference to an XLM macro. It doesn't hurt to
run the file through XLMdeobfuscator to see if we can extract any additional information. In
this instance, the output already corroborates our findings from olevba:
