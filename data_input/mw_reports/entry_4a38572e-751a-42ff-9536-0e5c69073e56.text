WhisperGate: Not NotPetya

The WhisperGate wiper attacks in Ukraine may inspire memories of NotPetya, but there are
significant distinctions. Security practices that mitigate ransomware attacks offer protection
against WhisperGate. Friday, January 21, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Destructive wiper attacks typically occur along geopolitical fault lines. Although some of
these attacks masquerade as ransomware, there is a fundamental difference. Cybercriminals
distribute ransomware to steal (or hold hostage) data that they can attempt to monetize. In

wiper attacks, the malware destroys data and renders it irretrievable. Wiper attacks are
usually conducted by government-sponsored threat actors to serve political interests, not to
generate profit.

Historical wiper attacks
The Shamoon wiper attacks in 2012, 2016, and 2017 were Iran's response to perceived
regional adversaries. North Korean wiper attacks on South Korean organizations mirrored
the military conflict between those countries. Even the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures
Entertainment was retribution by North Korea against a movie studio for perceived offense
against a political leader. Russian wiper attacks targeting Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 were
followed by the infamous 2017 NotPetya attacks. While it's unlikely that the NotPetya threat
actors intended its global impact and financial costs, it's clear they intended the malware to
have a significant impact to Ukraine.

WhisperGate versus NotPetya
The WhisperGate wiper deployed in Ukraine on January 13, 2022 was another example of
an attack serving political interests. WhisperGate is not a wiper-worm like NotPetya or WCry
(also known as WannaCry). It doesn't have the SMB-based propagation mechanisms that
made those worms so successful at spreading. The threat actors deliberately deployed
WhisperGate to targeted organizations.
One reported attack vector used to deploy WhisperGate was a supply chain attack against a
technology service provider. Details are limited as of this publication, but available evidence
suggests that the supply chain attack involved a traditional compromise of the service
provider. The threat actors then likely leveraged credentials and accesses from the provider's
network to compromise its customers.
In contrast, NotPetya was delivered indiscriminately via a more sophisticated supply chain
attack involving an accounting software provider. The threat actors used the legitimate
software update mechanism to distribute and execute a weaponized update. NotPetya
wormed its way across networks, rapidly escaping the intended geographic confines of
Ukraine to infect networks and organizations globally.

Similarities between WhisperGate and ransomware attacks
Some of the tactics and attack vectors used in the WhisperGate attacks are similar to those
used in ransomware attacks:
Ransomware is often deployed to targeted organizations directly, just as WhisperGate
was deliberately deployed to victims.
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed threat actors
compromising service providers to deploy ransomware.

Some organizations impacted by website defacements likely associated with the
WhisperGate attacks were reportedly compromised via exploitation of internet-facing
vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals and government-sponsored actors quickly attempt to
weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Recommendations
Organizations with operations in Ukraine should be extra vigilant and review business
continuity and resilience plans. It is unlikely that WhisperGate will impact organizations that
are outside of Ukraine and are not connected to the geopolitical tensions in that region.
However, organizations such as business partners and service providers in Ukraine that
have logical access to customer networks should consider the potential for collateral damage
that could spread to global operations.
For most organizations, ransomware is a more prominent threat. Cybersecurity practices to
address ransomware attacks also provide significant protection against a WhisperGate-style
attack:
Maintain backups of business-critical systems and data, protect the backups from a
potential ransomware or wiper attack, and regularly test restoration processes
Develop a plan to continue operations during a power failure or loss of business-critical
services
Segment networks and limit access to high-risk areas
Keep systems and software up to date, including applying patches for known
vulnerabilities as soon as possible on internet-facing systems and leveraging antivirus
solutions
Implement endpoint detection and response solutions and investigate alerts of
anomalous activity
