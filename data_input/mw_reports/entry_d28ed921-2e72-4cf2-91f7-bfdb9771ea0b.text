CISA Identifies SUPERNOVA Malware During Incident
Response
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-112a

Summary
This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat
actor techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently responded to an
advanced persistent threat (APT) actor’s long-term compromise of an entity’s enterprise
network, which began in at least March 2020. The threat actor connected to the entity’s
network via a Pulse Secure virtual private network (VPN) appliance, moved laterally to its
SolarWinds Orion server, installed malware referred to by security researchers as
SUPERNOVA (a .NET webshell), and collected credentials. (Updated April 29, 2021) Note:
at this time CISA cannot link this activity to exploitation of CVE-2021-22893 as addressed in
AA21-110A. The entity has run the Ivanti Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool and found
activity consistent with mismatched files. CISA is still investigating the root cause for the
mismatched files.
SUPERNOVA is a malicious webshell backdoor that allows a remote operator to dynamically
inject C# source code into a web portal to subsequently inject code. APT actors use
SUPERNOVA to perform reconnaissance, conduct domain mapping, and steal sensitive
information and credentials. (Note: for more information on SUPERNOVA, refer to Malware
Analysis Report MAR-10319053-1.v1 - SUPERNOVA.) According to a SolarWinds advisory,
SUPERNOVA is not embedded within the Orion platform as a supply chain attack; rather, an
attacker places it directly on a system that hosts SolarWinds Orion, and it is designed to
appear as part of the SolarWinds product.[1] CISA assesses this is a separate actor than the
APT actor responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise described in Alert AA20352A: Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical
Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations. Organizations that find SUPERNOVA on
their SolarWinds installations should treat this incident as a separate attack.
This report provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) CISA observed during an
incident response engagement. (Note: this threat actor targeted multiple entities in the same
period; some information in this Analysis Report is informed by other related incident
response engagements and CISA’s public and private sector partners.) This APT actor has
used opportunistic tradecraft, and much is still unknown about its TTPs.

Description
From at least March 2020 through February 2021, the threat actor connected to the entity via
the entity’s Pulse Secure VPN appliance (External Remote Services [T1133]). The threat
actor connected via the U.S.-based residential IP addresses listed below, which allowed
them to masquerade as teleworking employees. (Note: these IP addresses belong to routers
that are all similar models; based on this activity, CISA suspects that these routers were
likely exploited by the threat actor.)
207.89.9[.]153
24.140.28[.]90
24.117.18[.]111

The threat actor authenticated to the VPN appliance through several user accounts (Valid
Accounts [T1078]), none of which had multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. (CISA does
not know how the threat actor initially obtained these credentials.) Once authenticated to the
VPN appliance, the threat actor initiated a VPN connection to the environment (External
Remote Services [T1133]). The media access control (MAC) address of the threat actor’s
machine as recorded in the VPN appliance logs indicates use of a virtual machine. The
threat actor then moved laterally to the entity’s SolarWinds Orion appliance (Lateral
Movement [TA0008]) and established Persistence [TA0003] by using a PowerShell script
(Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell [T1059.001]) to decode
(Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information [T1140]) and install SUPERNOVA (Ingress Tool
Transfer [T1105], Server Software Component: Web Shell [T1505.003]). The SUPERNOVA
webshell allows a remote operator to dynamically inject C# source code into a web portal
provided via the SolarWinds software suite. The injected code is compiled and directly
executed in memory. For more information on SUPERNOVA, refer to MAR-10319053-1.v1 SUPERNOVA.
The threat actor was able to dump credentials from the SolarWinds appliance via two
methods (Credential Access [TA0006]).
The threat actor used Export-PfxCertificate to gather cached credentials used by
the SolarWinds appliance server and network monitoring (Unsecured Credentials:
Private Keys [T1552.004]). The private key certificate must have been marked as
exportable; either the threat actor was able to change or bypass that property prior, or
the affected entity mistakenly marked the certificate exportable.

2/5

The threat actor placed a copy of procdump.exe (Ingress Tool Transfer [T1105])—
disguised as the entity’s logging infrastructure, splunklogger.exe (Masquerading:
Rename System Utilities [T1036.003])—on the SolarWinds Orion server. The threat
actor used this tool and the system-level access to dump Local Security Authority
Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to obtain additional credentials (OS Credential
Dumping: LSASS Memory [T1003.001]). Once the credentials were dumped, the threat
actor placed them in the c:\inetpub\SolarWinds\ja\license.txt directory (Data
Staged: Local Data Staging [T1074.001]), and the threat actor made a GET request to
the entity’s internet information services (IIS) server to Exfiltrate [TA0010] the file
(Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]). The threat actor deleted the IIS logs for the
date in question (Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs [T1070.001]).
CISA believes the logs would have likely revealed the threat actor exploited CVE-202010148, an authentication bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Orion Application Programming
Interface (API) that allows a remote attacker to execute API commands.[2] CISA believes the
threat actor leveraged CVE-2020-10148 to bypass the authentication to the SolarWinds
appliance and then used SolarWinds Orion API ExecuteExternalProgram() to run
commands with the same privileges the SolarWinds appliance was running (in this case
SYSTEM ). CISA had not observed the threat actor using privileged accounts prior to the
credential dumps, and the account being used to connect to the SolarWinds appliance (via
VPN) did not have sufficient privilege to access it. The PowerShell process that initiated the
credential harvesting and installation of SUPERNOVA was a child process of the
solarwindsbusinesslayer.exe process. Two GET requests were logged in the following
day’s log, with the internal Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) address given to
the threat actor’s machine by the VPN appliance minutes after the exploitation, suggesting
the threat actor was interacting with the SolarWinds web application. (Note: although the
threat actor likely exploited CVE-2020-10148, it could have also exploited another API
authentication bypass or remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.)
Several weeks later, the threat actor connected again via the VPN appliance and attempted
to use credentials gained from the SolarWinds appliance. The threat actor connected to one
machine via Server Message Block (SMB) (Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] port 445)
and then attempted to login to an additional workstation (Remote Services: SMB/Windows
Admin Shares [T1021.002]). No additional activity was observed during this session.
On another occasion, the threat actor connected to the environment via the VPN and used
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) (Windows Management Instrumentation
[T1047]) to remotely launch a tasklist to determine the process ID for the LSASS process
(Process Discovery [T1057]). Then the threat actor, via WMI (Windows Management
Instrumentation [T1047]), launched procdump.exe , which was disguised as wininit.exe
(Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location [T1036.005]). After this, the threat actor
placed and ran winrar , which was also disguised as wininit.exe (Masquerading:
Match Legitimate Name or Location [T1036.005]), to archive credentials (Archive Collected

3/5

Data: Archive via Utility [T1560.001]) before Exfiltration [TA0010]. CISA observed the
disguised wininit.exe commands on two separate machines—one server and one
workstation. The commands executed were:
cmd /c tasklist /vc:\windows\temp\TS_85ET.tmp
procdump.exe :
cmd.exe c:\windows\temp\wininit.exe -accepteula -ma 992
c:\windows\temp\TS_9D3C.tmp
winrar.exe :
c:\windows\temp\wininit.exe a c:\windows\temp\googleupdate.tmp hpJimJameJump c:\windows\temp\TS_9D3C.tmp.dmp

Upon discovery of the incident, the affected entity performed incident response in
accordance with its incident response plan, and CISA’s engagement is ongoing. CISA
encourages organizations to apply the recommendations provided in the
Recommendations section. Organizations observing related activity should to enact their
incident response plan.

Recommendations
CISA recommends all organizations implement the following practices to strengthen the
security posture of their organization's systems.
Check for instances of common executables executing with the hash of another
process (e.g., splunklogger.exe with the hash of procdump ).
Implement MFA, especially for privileged accounts.
Use separate administrative accounts on separate administration workstations.
Implement Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).
Implement the principle of least privilege on data access.
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other remote access solutions using MFA
and “jump boxes” for access.
Deploy and maintain endpoint defense tools on all endpoints.
Ensure all software is up to date.
If your organization has ever used SolarWinds Orion versions 2019.4 through
2020.2.1 HF1, refer to CISA’s Emergency Directive ED 21-01, associated
supplemental guidance, and CISA’s Activity Alert AA20-352A for additional
guidance prior to applying patches. Although ED 21-01 and associated guidance
only apply to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, CISA encourages nonfederal entities to review them for recommendations on operating the SolarWinds
Orion platform.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.
Do not add users to the local administrators' group unless required.
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
4/5

Enable a personal firewall on organization workstations that is configured to deny
unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on organization workstations and servers.
