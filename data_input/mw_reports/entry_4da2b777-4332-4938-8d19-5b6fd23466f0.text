KillDisk Variant Hits Latin American Financial Groups

Updated as of January 15, 11:58 PM PDT to clarify that the new variant of KillDisk we found
does not have a ransom note.
We came across a new variant of the disk-wiping KillDisk targeting financial organizations in
Latin America. Trend Micro detects it as TROJ_KILLDISK.IUB. Trend Micro™ Deep
Discovery™ proactively blocks any intrusions or attacks associated with this threat. Initial
analysis (which is still ongoing) reveals that it may be a component of another payload, or
part of a bigger attack. We are still analyzing this new KillDisk variant and we will update this
post as we uncover more details about this threat.
KillDisk, along with the multipurpose, cyberespionage-related BlackEnergy, was used in
cyberattacks in late December 2015 against Ukraine’s energy sector as well as its banking,
rail, and mining industries. The malware has since metamorphosed into a threat used for
digital extortion, affecting Windows and Linux platforms. The note accompanying the
ransomware versions, like in the case of Petya, was a ruse: Because KillDisk also overwrites
and deletes files (and don’t store the encryption keys on disk or online), recovering the
scrambled files was out of the question. The new variant we found, however, does not
include a ransom note.

How is it dropped in the system?
This KillDisk variant looks like it is intentionally dropped by another process/attacker. Its file
path is hardcoded in the malware (c:\windows\dimens.exe), which means that it is tightly
coupled with its installer or is a part of a bigger package.

KillDisk also has a self-destruct process, although it isn’t really deleting itself. It renames its
file to c:\windows\0123456789 while running. This string is hardcoded in the sample we
analyzed. It expects its file path to be c:\windows\dimens.exe (also hardcoded). Accordingly,
if disk forensics is performed and dimens.exe is searched, the file that will be retrieved will be
the newly created file with 0x00 byte content.
How does it delete files?
This new KillDisk variant goes through all logical drives (fixed and removable) starting from
drive b:. If the logical drive contains the system directory, the files and folders in the following
directories and subdirectories are exempted from deletion:
WINNT
Users
Windows
Program Files
Program Files (x86)
ProgramData
Recovery (case-sensitive check)
$Recycle.Bin
System Volume Information
old
PerfLogs

Before a file is deleted, it is first randomly renamed. KillDisk will overwrite the first 0x2800
bytes of the file and another block that’s 0x2800-bytes big with 0x00.

How does it wipe the disk?

2/4

The malware attempts to wipe \\.\PhysicalDrive0 to \\.\PhysicalDrive4. It reads the Master
Boot Record (MBR) of every device it successfully opens and proceeds to overwrite the first
0x20 sectors of the device with “0x00”. It uses the information from the MBR to do further
damage to the partitions it lists. If the partition it finds is not an extended one, it overwrites
the first 0x10 and last sectors of the actual volume. If it finds an extended partition, it will
overwrite the Extended Boot Record (EBR) along with the two extra partitions it points to.

overwrites the EBR (bottom)
What happens after the MBR, files, and folders are overwritten and/or deleted?
KillDisk has a numeric parameter that denotes the number of minutes (15 being the default)
it will wait before it shuts down the affected machine. To try to reboot the machine, it will try to
terminate these processes:
Client/server run-time subsystem (csrss.exe)
Windows Start-Up Application (wininit.exe)
Windows Logon Application (winlogon.exe)
Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe)
This is done most likely to force a reboot or dupe the user into restarting the machine.
Terminating csrss.exe and wininit.exe, for instance, will cause a blue screen of death
(BSOD). Terminating winlogon.exe will prompt the user to log in again, while terminating
lsass.exe will cause a reboot. KillDisk also uses the ExitWindowsEx function to forcefully
restart the machine.

What can organizations do?
KillDisk’s destructive capabilities, and how it could be just a part of a bigger attack, highlight
the significance of defense in depth: securing the perimeters — from gateways, endpoints,
and networks to servers — to further reduce the attack surface. Here are some best
practices for organizations.
Keep the system and its applications updated/patched to deter attackers from
exploiting security gaps; consider virtual patching for legacy systems.
Regularly back up data and ensure its integrity.
Enforce the principle of least privilege. Network segmentation and data
categorization help prevent lateral movement and further exposure.
Deploy security mechanisms such as application control/whitelisting and behavior
monitoring, which can block suspicious programs from running and thwart anomalous
system modifications.

3/4

Proactively monitor the system and network; enable and employ firewalls as well as
intrusion prevention and detection systems.
Implement a managed incident response policy that will drive proactive remediation
strategies; further strengthen the organization’s security posture by cultivating a
cybersecurity-aware workplace.
