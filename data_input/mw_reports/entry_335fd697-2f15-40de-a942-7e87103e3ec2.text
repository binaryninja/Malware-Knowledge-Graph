PART 1: DARKHOTEL

DarkHotel is a sophisticated and active advanced persistent threat (APT) group. It’s highly
capable and is known for finding and taking advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities
in common software also known as a 0day. It is a well-established group that has been
active since 2007, are known Korean-speakers, and are working on behalf of a nation state.

DarkHotel was first disclosed in 2014 and is also known as DUBNIUM, Black Shop, Fallout
Team, Karba, Luder, Nemim, Nemain, Tapaoux, Pioneer, Shadow Crane, APT-C-06, and
TUNGSTEN BRIDGE. From the NSA’s sigs.py script (also known as Territorial Dispute or
TeDi) DarkHotel is signature number 25 (SIG25). Malware associated with DarkHotel
includes Asruex, Parastic Beast, Inexsmar, Retro backdoor, Gh0st RAT, and the new
Ramsay toolkit. Vulnerabilities leveraged in its 0day exploits include CVE-2018-8174, CVE-

2/9

2018-8373, CVE-2019-1458, CVE-2019-13720, CVE-2019-17026, and CVE-2020-0674.
DarkHotel also often exploits CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2017-11882, high-risk well-known
issues in Microsoft Office.

DarkHotel appropriately earned its name infecting the WiFi networks (WLANs) of hotels
typically used by business executives. This was in effort to compromise their devices such as
smartphones and laptops that may potentially contain intellectual property and the
individual’s emails or contact lists. The WLAN of the hotels are compromised via leveraging
stolen certificates, deploying .HTA files that masquerades as software updates containing the
malware. The WiFi routers themselves are taken over either by remotely exploiting
vulnerabilities or by gaining physical access inside the targeted hotels. As DarkHotel is statesponsored it more than likely has capable human operators to deploy during its campaign.

This APT has targeted a wide array of countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa.
It primarily focuses on North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and China. Organisations in
sectors such as telecommunications, manufacturing, finance, pharmaceutical, chemicals,
automotive, defence, law enforcement, militaries, and NGOs have all been compromised by
DarkHotel.

DarkHotel has repeatedly demonstrated its capabilities of developing exploits for 0day
vulnerabilities in software such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and
Windows Kernel. The exploits are leveraged to deliver malware that can provide backdoor
access and remote control over the target device. DarkHotel hides its malware behind layers
of encryption, obfuscation, and only deploys it in singular attacks so as not to expose its

3/9

stolen certificates or 0day vulnerabilities. This group is a well-established expert at spearphishing where it has researched its targets using OSINT and potentially HUMINT. Its lures
have included political news, changes in legislation, and other business news.

In November 2014, we saw the first details of the specific activities of the DarkHotel APT.
Kaspersky published a report detailing a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign targeting
business travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has been around for nearly a
decade and some researchers believe its members are Korean speakers. In 2015, it was
found that DarkHotel was more than likely exploiting a leaked 0day vulnerability from the
Italian offensive security firm, Hacking Team. DarkHotel used spear-phishing emails with
.RAR archives that appear to hold a harmless-looking .jpg file. If opened, MS paint is
launched and its malware is executed in the background.

In May 2018, DarkHotel was found to be responsible for distributing a 0day for CVE-20188174. This attack used URLMoniker to invoke Internet Explorer via Microsoft Word while
ignoring the victim's default browser settings - a previously unknown technique. The group
also leveraged CVE-2018-8373 later that same year.

In November 2019, a threat campaign was discovered, dubbed ‘Operation WizardOpium’,
which exploited a vulnerability in Google’s Chrome Browser, tracked as CVE-2019-13720.
The exploit was deployed on a Korean-language news portal, the site’s main page had
malicious JavaScript injected into it. No threat group has been linked directly to Operation
WizardOpium, but similarities in code samples have been correlated with both the Lazarus
and DarkHotel APTs. Part of the attacks included a Microsoft Windows privilege escalation
0day exploit - which was later assigned CVE-2019-1458 - that utilised the win32k component
of the Windows kernel. This bug, CVE-2019-1458, meant that the attackers could bypass
detection systems on Google Chrome’s sandbox to deploy the other 0day exploit for CVE2019-13720. [1]

More recently, ESET uncovered a previously unreported cyber-espionage toolkit, dubbed
Ramsay, that is tailored for collection and exfiltration of sensitive documents and is capable
of operating within air-gapped networks. It shares similarities with the Retro backdoor and is
linked to DarkHotel. [2]

Tencent has further analysed the Ramsay attacks and cross-analysed the IOCs with
campaigns it has tracked in the past. Interestingly, these attacks and those related to the
Retro backdoor go as far back as 18 years ago and later incorporated the Asruex backdoor

4/9

to attack isolated networks since 2015. Tencent has linked these attacks to DarkHotel, a
threat group that it claims is allegedly working for the National Intelligence Service of the
South Korean government. [3]

The DarkHotel threat group has launched a large campaign targeting Chinese government
agencies and their employees. The attacks began in March, and are thought to be using
coronavirus-themed lures. The threat actors are using a 0day vulnerability (tracked as SRC2020-281) in Sangfor SSL VPN servers to provide remote access to enterprise and
government networks. [4]

Security research group RedDrip also found that the DarkHotel threat group developed a
new exploit for another Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerability, CVE-2019-1367, to target China.
At the time of reporting, the malicious file being used to exploit this flaw is currently detected
by 18 out of 57 engines on VirusTotal. [5, 6]

In April 2020, JPCERT found that an APT group was exploiting two vulnerabilities patched
earlier this year in Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE). These attacks have mostly been aimed
at China and Japan. The first flaw affects the Firefox browser and is tracked as CVE-201917026. The second, designated CVE-2020-0674, is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw in
Internet Explorer. Both bugs were patched in January and February 2020. Both
vulnerabilities were used as part of a campaign aimed at Chinese government agencies and
attributed to the DarkHotel APT. This campaign delivered the Gh0st RAT malware onto
compromised devices. [7]

Threat actors recently attempted to break into the systems of the World Health
Organization (WHO). The organisation reported a significant increase in attacks against it
since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The most recent activity was observed around
13 March, when a group of malicious actors launched a fake site impersonating the WHO's
internal email system. It has not be confirmed who is exactly responsible for the attack but
researchers believe that it was the DarkHotel threat group. Further, Kaspersky researchers
found that the same infrastructure was also used in targeting other healthcare and
humanitarian organisations. [8]

PART 2: STARCRUFT

5/9

In mid-2019 ScarCruft APT was also dislcosed by Kaspersky researchers. Their investigation
led to uncovering that it's another Korean-speaking threat actor with several connections to
DarkHotel. StarCruft became known for creating new tools and techniques to identify
Bluetooth devices. These are used for information gathering campaigns and finding targets.

StarCruft also developed a new method to steal data from smartphones and created
malware that could fingerprint Bluetooth devices using the Windows Bluetooth API.
Interestingly, the group's targets include investment and trading companies in Vietnam and
Russia that have links to North Korea, along with organisations based in Hong Kong and
North Korea. [1, 2]

PART 3: HIGAISA

Late last year, a new APT was publicly disclosed by Tencent, dubbed Higaisa. It was initially
thought that the group was North Korean, but researchers concluded that Higaisa instead
originated from South Korea. The Higaisa APT's main targets have been government,
diplomatic, and trade organisations with links to North Korea. It has carried out attacks in
China, Japan, Russia, Poland, and other nation states. Higaisa is an evolving threat as it
began by distributing executable files in an unsophisticated way. Now, however, the group
leverages exploits and complex multi-stage infection chains with advanced defence evasion
techniques.

More recently COVID-19-themed phishing lures have been linked to Higaisa. The decoy
document used in the attacks, an LNK file disguised as a PDF, contains a World Health
Organisation (WHO) situation report regarding the spread of COVID-19. If opened, arbitrary
commands are executed to download an encrypted payload to initiate the infection chain.
After several stages of obfuscated payloads, the compromised device is connected to
Higaisa’s C&C server. Other malware observed in the attacks includes Gh0st RAT that
provides backdoor access and remote control for further post-exploitation activities. A simple
infostealer is used to collect system information that also facilitates the execution of console
commands and relays the responses to the C&C server. Newer Higaisa attacks now
leverage the Zeplin collaborative platform in more decoy PDFs disguised as LNK files
that also deliver Gh0st RAT.

6/9

Interestingly, PT Security researchers found that two of the classes in Higaisa APT's
malware code were named “SK_Parasite” and “NIS_K”. The researchers speculate that
these could reference the South Korean film Parasite and the National Intelligence Service
(NIS) of the Republic of Korea. Alone, these are insufficient to draw firm conclusions;
however, they can be seen as circumstantial evidence of a connection with South Korea.[1,
2, 3]

CONCLUSION:

Little is known about South Korea’s cyber capabilities and nothing has been confirmed.
However, DarkHotel has been linked to both Higaisa and StarCruft, all of them have some
connection to South Korea in one way or another. All share similar targets, strategies, and
campaigns have led security researchers to conclude that the three groups either work
alongside one another or are the same group using new tactics.

DarkHotel is one of the most dangerous and active APT actors on the current threat
landscape. There is currently not enough evidence to confidently say DarkHotel belongs to
the NIS of the ROK, as APT actors often purposely scatter false flags in their code to lead
researchers down a rabbit hole.

7/9

Nonetheless, DarkHotel's ability to consistently find 0day vulnerabilities and develop exploits
for them is a major security concern for governments and businesses worldwide. All
organisations, specifically those with business or diplomatic relationships with South Korea
must remain cautious of this sophisticated APT, along with the well-established APTs from
North Korea such as Lazarus, Kimsuky, Konni, and Reaper.
