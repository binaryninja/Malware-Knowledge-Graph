DarkSide: The new ransomware group behind highly
targeted attacks

September 22, 2020

We’ve recently observed the emergence of a new ransomware operation named DarkSide.
The nuance of the operation includes corporate-like methods and customized ransomware
executables, which have made headlines. When it comes to analyzing new ransomware
campaigns, one might ask, “how innovative is this threat compared to previous ones?” Well,
DarkSide is no different from its counterparts but is indeed the latest representation of the
rising Ransomware-as-a-Corporation (RaaC) trend. Cybercriminals have seen their revenues
steadily increase in the last years, making the ransomware market extremely prolific.
Consequently, we’ve observed frequent attempts from threat actors to upscale their
operations’ external appearance to improve their reliability and reputation.

In the past month, Digital Shadows has been closely monitoring DarkSide, owing to their
recent operation premiere and the interesting methods they utilize throughout their
campaign. Since the threat intelligence nerds at Digital Shadows find this new operation so
fascinating, we wanted to create a blog to detail our findings.
With that said, come with us to the DarkSide (see what we did there?) to get the skinny on
our recent discoveries.

Bringing DarkSide to light

1/8

The DarkSide operation is hardly innovating in terms of tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) used by other threat actors. The group shares its methods with infamous names like
DoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi, Maze, and NetWalker. Many researchers that have analyzed the
DarkSide ransomware agree that there are significant overlaps between this operation and
those mentioned above. What, then, makes DarkSide particularly interesting? The answer is
threefold:
1. The group has a highly targeted approach to targeting their victims
2. Custom ransomware executables are carefully prepared for each target
3. There is a corporate-like method of communication throughout their attacks
The group behind DarkSide announced its new ransomware operation via a press release on
their Tor domain in August 2020. Up until this point, some researchers have claimed that the
group has earned over one million USD; however, Digital Shadows cannot corroborate a
definite figure at the time of this report. Possibly in an attempt to underline their experience,
they made a point to clarify that the DarkSide operation isn’t their first criminal experience;
the campaign was developed to refine existing products into the ultimate ransomware tool.

Figure 2: DarkSide press release announcing a new ransomware campaign
The press release stated several ethical principles that guide the group’s decision process
regarding their potential targets; they claim that the DarkSide operation will never target
critical and vulnerable bodies such as schools, hospitals, or even governments. We’ve seen
other groups claim to stay away from specific sectors (ahem… Maze); however, a recently
unattributed ransomware attack, which targeted Duesseldorf University Hospital, may have

inadvertently caused a woman to lose her life. With these tragic concerns in mind, we’ll see if
they stick to their plan. To go even further, the group behind DarkSide states their intent to
select their targets based on their financial revenue. This method implies that a ransom price
is modeled around the victim organization’s net income.
The operators behind DarkSide harvest the clear text data from their victim’s server before
encrypting it and requesting a ransom. The stolen data is then uploaded to DarkSide’s leak
website, which serves as a powerful extortion tool for the threat group. The targeted
company risks sensitive data loss after a successful attack, and not to mention, a public
breach can severely damage an organization’s reputation. If this tactic sounds familiar to
you, you’re right on the money – we’ve been closely following the pay-or-get-breached trend
since late 2019.

They’re only interested in stealing from the rich
As we mentioned earlier, other ransomware operators have claimed to remove specific
sectors from their attack itinerary. DarkSide’s claim to avoid attacking companies within the
education, healthcare, and government sectors can appear professional and respectable.
Nonetheless, some promises are broken, and it is yet to be seen whether DarkSide will
maintain its stated intentions.
DarkSide has additionally claimed that they choose their targets and determine a suitable
ransom based on an organization’s financial revenue. It’s unconfirmed where DarkSide
sources their organizational finance information from; however, Digital Shadows has found
that, like many other ransomware operators, they may leverage relevant details from
ZoomInfo.

Upping the ante with customized ransomware executables
DarkSide’s operators customize the ransomware executable for the specific company they
are attacking, indicating that they customize each attack for maximum effectiveness. The
ransomware executes a PowerShell command that deletes Shadow Volume Copies on the
system. DarkSide then proceeds to terminate various databases, applications, and mail
clients to prepare for encryption. However, the following processes are avoided:
Vmcompute.exe
Vmms.exe
Vmwp.exe

Svchost.exe
TeamViewer.exe
Explorer.exe
Although unconfirmed, it is realistically possible that the operators use TeamViewer for
remote access to computers, as it is rare that this process would be avoided.
Each customized executable includes a personalized ransom note, which consists of the
amount of data that was stolen, the type of data, and a link to the data on the group’s data
leak site, where victims’ information is leaked if a ransom demand is not met. While the site
only references one compromised organization at the time of this blog, we plan to keep an
eye on this group. In the meantime, we have listed DarkSide’s current indicators of
compromise (IoCs) and their associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques at the end of this blog.

Press releases make it look more professional, right?
DarkSide attempts to build trust with the victim and the other actors involved by leveraging
professional communication methods. Over time, we have found that trust plays a pivotal
role in the cybercriminal world and often determines the possibilities of an entity’s growth and
expansion. For example, the English-language marketplace, Empire, had long represented a
trust stronghold on the dark web, favoring its establishment in the underground scene – until
recently, when rumors of a possible exit scam started to circulate and gain increasing
traction.
The use of a press release to announce a new ransomware operation is a symbol of the
threat actor’s intentions and maintains a dual-use:
1. Usually, only corporations and institutions use press releases; they project the
impression of dealing with a professional body. In this case, a press release may
convince the victim to trust the threat actor and pay the requested ransom.
2. Press releases attract media attention and ultimately weaponize stolen data, leading to
severe reputational damage to a targeted organization.
This operation isn’t the first time a threat group has used a press release to communicate its
latest operations or threaten a victim. Many of us remember the campaigns conducted by
“thedarkoverlord” in 2016 and 2017, which leveraged press releases in the wake of their
attacks. Even more recently, in May 2020, REvil ransomware operators posted press
releases to pressure their victims, which overtly named the compromised organizations and
claimed to double their ransoms.

Looking forward: Ransomware, Inc.
Although this operation displays a unique combination of tactics, communication, and ethical
claims, DarkSide merely seems to be the latest product belonging to the growing trend of
ransomware professionalization.
As RaaC continues to remain a popular method due to its rewarding financial return, we plan
to see new threat groups with differing technical capabilities entering the ransomware
Thunderdome. Whether or not they’ll succeed in breaking the mold – only time will tell. While
the cyber threat landscape can be unpredictable and volatile, a trend is a trend, and we will
continue to monitor the cybercriminal bandwagon closely.
