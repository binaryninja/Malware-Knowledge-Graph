Decrypting Strings in Emdivi

Decrypting Strings in Emdivi

A Volatility Plugin Created for Detecting
Malware Used in Targeted Attacks

Hello, this is You ‘Tsuru’ Nakatsuru at Analysis Center.

Emdivi and the Rise of Targeted Attacks
in Japan

As introduced in the previous blog post, my colleagues presented on the attacks arising
in Japan at CODE BLUE 2015, entitled “Revealing the Attack Operations Targeting
Japan”.
In this entry, I will introduce the details of an IDAPython script
“emdivi_string_decryptor.py”, which JPCERT/CC developed to analyse Emdivi, a remote
control malware. The script was also introduced in our presentation at CODE BLUE 2015.
Please utilize the script along with the codes, etc., that are already published on
JPCERT/CC’s GitHub account.

Encrypted Strings within Emdivi
Emdivi encrypts strings such as URLs that they connect to and stores them in itself.
Depending on the sample, encrypted strings are Base64-encoded and stored as in Figure
1, or in other cases, just saved in an encrypted binary format.

In the incident analysis phase, these encrypted strings need to be decrypted in order to
identify information such as URLs that the malware connects to, etc. For this purpose,
JPCERT/CC developed emdivi_string_decryptor.py.

Analysis on Emdivi’s Decryption Process

A New UAC Bypass Method that Dridex
Uses

Emdivi runs the following process in order to decrypt the strings in itself.
Upon its startup, it calculates the key for decryption, based on the following string
information:
The sample’s version strings
e.g. t17.08.26..3340.4444
Random long strings in the sample
e.g. jp5cQEhSR7xMEdv1JOjh5eKGsMxSCAE5M57CijC8VgN1KMbBvP9
(Omitted hereafter)
It then combines these strings with Base64 encode, MD5 hash value calculation and
others to calculate the decryption key as in Figure 2. Depending on Emdivi’s version, it
sometimes combines addition and other arithmetic process for this calculation.

Using the decryption key calculated here, Emdivi performs decryption just before it uses
the strings. Processes related to the encryption are implemented as classes. Figure 3
shows information of those classes.

#APCERT

Figure 3: Encryption related classes defined within Emdivi

#FIRST

Many samples of Emdivi use XxTEA as in Figure 3, but we have confirmed that some
versions use AES. Also, there are some versions that switch the encryption and
decryption process, and we have seen that some use XxTEA encryption process for
decryption.

After analysing various samples of Emdivi, we were able to summarise the method for the
decryption key calculation and the decryption process as in Chart 1 below. For details of
the decryption key generation process, please refer to the source codes of
emdivi_string_decryptor.py.

Before Using emdivi_string_decryptor.py
Since emdivi_string_decryptor.py is an IDAPython script, it requires disassembler IDA for
execution. Also, the version string used when calculating the decryption key is required
for string decryption.
Before actually using the tool, you have to obtain the version string from the memory or
communication data.
If you are obtaining the string from the memory, execute Emdivi in an analysis
environment and then search for the string in the memory by using debugger, etc. You do
not have to worry about virtual environment detection, since the version string is
generated before the detection process.
If you are obtaining the version string from the communication data, you would need to
decode that data. For decoding, you can use emdivi_postdata_decoder.py which is also
made public together with emdivi_string_decryptor.py. Here below is what you will see
when executing by giving the data you want to decode to emdivi_postdata_decoder.py’s
argument.
> python emdivi_postdata_decoder.py

Please note that the version string included in the communication data may be different
from the string required for the decryption. Therefore, we recommend obtaining the string
from the memory.
Executing emdivi_string_decryptor.py
If you have obtained the version string, you are all set. Load the target Emdivi into IDA,
and execute emdivi_string_decryptor.py. Then, it will process as follows:
1. Input version string
2. Calculate decryption key
3. Search for encrypted string
4. Decrypt string
5. Output results and insert comments in the corresponding section
Upon execution of emdivi_string_decryptor.py, the following dialog box appears to input
the version string.

Figure 4: Dialog box to input version string

After you input the version string, the tool will display the decrypted string in the console,
and it will be inserted as a comment to where the encrypted string is stored. This is shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Screenshot after executing emdivi_string_decryptor.py

Now you can obtain various information including URLs that the malware connects to.
Based on these and other related pieces of information, JPCERT/CC coordinates and
handles incidents caused by attack operations involving Emdivi.
In Summary
We hope that the scripts that we made public will contribute in dealing with the attacks
relating to Emdivi, and in improving malware analysis techniques.
A blog entry by Kaspersky (see Reference) has revealed that a few versions of Emdivi
use the infected users’ SID. Unfortunately, the current version of
emdivi_string_decryptor.py is not yet adapted to input SID. Furthermore, it is possible that
new versions of Emdivi with other encryption methods may emerge in the future. We
welcome any pull requests on GitHub.
Thanks for reading.
