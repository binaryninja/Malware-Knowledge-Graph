A nation state attack leveraging software from SolarWinds has caused a ripple effect
throughout the security industry, impacting multiple organizations. We first reported on the
event in our December 14 blog and notified our business customers using SolarWinds
asking them to take precautionary measures.
While Malwarebytes does not use SolarWinds, we, like many other companies were recently
targeted by the same threat actor. We can confirm the existence of another intrusion vector
that works by abusing applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure
environments. After an extensive investigation, we determined the attacker only gained
access to a limited subset of internal company emails. We found no evidence of
unauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production
environments.
How did this impact Malwarebytes?

1/3

We received information from the Microsoft Security Response Center on December 15
about suspicious activity from a third-party application in our Microsoft Office 365 tenant
consistent with the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the same advanced threat
actor involved in the SolarWinds attacks.
We immediately activated our incident response group and engaged Microsoft’s Detection
and Response Team (DART). Together, we performed an extensive investigation of both our
cloud and on-premises environments for any activity related to the API calls that triggered
the initial alert. The investigation indicates the attackers leveraged a dormant email
protection product within our Office 365 tenant that allowed access to a limited subset of
internal company emails. We do not use Azure cloud services in our production
environments.
Considering the supply chain nature of the SolarWinds attack, and in an abundance of
caution, we immediately performed a thorough investigation of all Malwarebytes source
code, build and delivery processes, including reverse engineering our own software. Our
internal systems showed no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any onpremises and production environments. Our software remains safe to use.
What we know: SolarWinds Attackers Also Target Administrative and Service
Credentials
As the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stated, the adversary did
not only rely on the SolarWinds supply-chain attack but indeed used additional means to
compromise high-value targets by exploiting administrative or service credentials.
In 2019, a security researcher exposed a flaw with Azure Active Directory where one could
escalate privileges by assigning credentials to applications. In September 2019, he found
that the vulnerability still existed and essentially lead to backdoor access to principals’
credentials into Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph.
Third-party applications can be abused if an attacker with sufficient administrative privilege
gains access to a tenant. A newly released CISA report reveals how threat actors may have
obtained initial access by password guessing or password spraying in addition to exploiting
administrative or service credentials. In our particular instance, the threat actor added a selfsigned certificate with credentials to the service principal account. From there, they can
authenticate using the key and make API calls to request emails via MSGraph.
For many organizations, securing Azure tenants may be a challenging task, especially when
dealing with third-party applications or resellers. CrowdStrike, which was also targeted but in
an unsuccessful attempt, has released a tool to help companies identify and mitigate risks in
Azure Active Directory.
Coming together as an industry

2/3

While we have learned a lot of information in a relatively short period of time, there is much
more yet to be discovered about this long and active campaign that has impacted so many
high-profile targets. It is imperative that security companies continue to share information
that can help the greater industry in times like these, particularly with such new and complex
attacks often associated with nation state actors.
We would like to thank the security community, particularly FireEye and Microsoft for sharing
so many details regarding this attack. In an already difficult year, security practitioners and
incident responders responded to the call of duty and worked throughout the holiday season,
including our own dedicated employees. The security industry is full of exceptional people
who are tirelessly defending others, and today it is strikingly evident just how essential our
work is moving forward.
Update: Clarified statement about “Azure Active Directory weakness”.
Update 2: Clarified that the attack on CrowdStrike was not successful
