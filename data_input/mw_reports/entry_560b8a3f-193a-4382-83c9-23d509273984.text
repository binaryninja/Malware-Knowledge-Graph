Takeaways

Cybercrime groups often operate on traditional crime group behavioral patterns.

1/15

REvil main collective group patterns are: seeking for attention, aggression motivated by
impunity, overconfidence, and rigid group identity
REvil behavioral patterns have likely directly triggered and impacted their recent
attacks against high-profile entities
REvil operations against famous and politically engaged public entities and
personalities will likely become their syndicate’s main focus

Introduction

The REvil Group is one of the most prominent Russian-speaking ransomware groups in the
cyber domain. In May, it made headlines for extorting numerous high-profile clients of the
New York City-based entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas and Sacks,
as well as the California-based IP law firm Vierra Magen Marcus. The threats had impactful
political implications as these firms represent high profile clients, such as President Donald
Trump and the United States Navy, respectively. After attempting to threaten President
Donald Trump with a $42 million USD extortion, the group was even branded as a terrorist
organization.

Naturally, the attacks and the subsequent political response has changed REvil’s place in the
cybercrime ecosystem. On one hand, the group is now more well-known than it has ever
been. On the other hand, the Russian-speaking cybercrime community - a foundation is
demonstrating explicit resentment to the syndicate’s actions. This resentment could lead
REvil to lose its foundation within the community - a foundation that is existentially important
to an organized cybercrime group.

Recent events can shed light on essential aspects underlying REvil's operations - their
collective identities and psychological patterns that define them as a criminal enterprise. The
way that REvil communicates, operates and builds relationships is determined by the
psychological and organizational motives of its members, their perception of hierarchy, selfidentification, and their relationship with the community.

We have investigated REvil’s discourse and behavior by applying the methodologies and
concepts of criminal psychology to identify the group’s unique characteristics revealed by
their recent involvement in large, ethically questionable (attacks against medical institutions),
2/15

and politically impactful extortions. By applying these methodologies, we attempt to achieve
a deeper understanding of the group’s actions in order to successfully predict and prevent its
operations.

The Breach of Trust: Extorting the Extortionist

On April 15, 2020, on the XSS forum, which serves as one of the main grounds for
community relationships across the Russian speaking underground, an actor “Vivalamuerte”
claimed that they have information on UNKN, the leader of the REvil group. This event, most
likely preceded by a month of private negotiations, was the first major conflict between REvil
and members of the Russian-specking community - a major breach of trusted relationships.

Vivalamuerte threatened to reveal information about UNKN identity unless paid $190,000
USD. “Vivalamuerte” claims this is the amount that REvil’s leader owes them as this sum
was invested in UNKN’s original cryptolocker creation efforts in 2016. To make matters worse
for UNKN and their team, prior to this extortion, UNKN has lost over 150,000 USD in a
transaction operated by the Exploit forum administrators - another significant trust breach.

Two weeks later, on April 27, 2020, an Exploit forum user EXPL0 asked in broken Russian if
there was room in the REvil Group ransomware program. REvil denied the request due to
EXPL0’s non-Russian background. However, a couple of weeks later on May 13, 2020,
UNKN shared that there had been a breach and disclosure of authentication data and
blamed it on EXPL0 who was integrated into the syndicate by one of UNKN’s Russian
speaking affiliates.

group’s position in the hierarchy by openly challenging their reputation

This deterioration of relationships between REvil and the cyber community correlated with
the group’s attack becoming more aggressive, outrageous, and unethical. For instance, on
March 13, 2020, - when the private negotiations with “Vivalamuerte” extortionists were likely
taking place, REvil hacked a biotechnology company, 10x Genomics, despite the COVID-19
pandemics and possible healthcare ramifications from the attack. On May 14, 2020, REvil
hacked entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas and Sacks in order to
extort high profile clients, such as Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, and Donald Trump. Then,
on May 29, REvil continued the pattern of targeting high-profile law firms, hacking IP law firm
Vierra Magen Marcus.

It is likely that these events are connected. The team threatened by the “Vivalamuerte” attack
on their anonymity aggravated by the EXPL0 case and was taking actions defined by a
threat-driven mindset. REvil may have resorted to extorting top-tier companies and
individuals in order to obtain a higher payload and ensure that Vivalamuerte does not expose
UNKN. The group may have been uniquely motivated to pursue highly visible targets in the
hopes of obtaining higher payouts. But the connection between this extortion and REvil
recent aggressive behavior is likely even deeper - defined by collective and individual
psychology - specifically matters of overconfidence, feelings of impunity, and identity
formation.

Attention, Impunity, Confidence

4/15

Image 2: REvil’s criminal behavior patterns

REvil posts on forums are provocative, extravagant, and flamboyant. This may suggest this
team is not only seeking financial profits, but also attention. This may be a style of doing
business and a psychological phenomenon.

According to Vivalamuerte, UNKN has changed its nickname on the forum four times and
works very hard to avoid detection. As a young man from Minsk with a troubled background,
they most likely entered the cybercrime enterprise because of being financially troubled
without any other financial options to turn to. If Vivalamuerte’s allegations are true it is

5/15

rewarding for UNKN to be able to attract worldwide attention and be recognized in a criminal
business enterprise. They most likely did not have a supportive family and can now receive
recognition and notoriety for their chaotic behaviors.

This motivation is not solely egotistical and emotional. On the operational level, the fact that
REvil receives a large amount of media attention from international headlines describing their
renowned tools and techniques helps the group to establish a dominating place within the
community. As a Ransomware-as-a-Service, group REvil uses its fame to its advantage in
order to attract and recruit talented affiliates. When recruiting affiliates, they use fame as a
tool of self-legitimization. The group spokesman stated: “You can read about us in the media.
An envelope with 6 zeros is an ordinary and daily business for us.”

Another essential factor shaping REvil’s motivations and behavior is a feeling of impunity.
While seeking profits and attention the group made the headlines, yet faced little to no
punishment. The group has been caught, moreover, their predecessor, a ransomware
syndicate - GandCrab, publicly bragged that they are living proof that one can steal without
getting caught. Considering that UNKN may have joined cybercrime as a last resort to
become rich and famous (According to Vivalamuerte) and considering the connection
between the two groups REvil may be looking at GandCrab as a role model, and as an
example of a successful ransomware collective that made billions and resigned unpunished.

The overt impunity also has an operational benefit, as just as publicity, it helps to bring
talents to the group - a fundamental requirement for a successful RaaS enterprise. It is
probable that REvil is aware that by receiving recognition for pulling off intelligent operations
without getting caught they can recruit more capable members into their syndicate.

As such, REvil is not held accountable for its actions, receives widespread international
attention for their cunning and malicious activities and feels good about their technological
prowess. All of these processes feed into building up the organization's ego and convince
them that due to their anonymity and skill, they will not be held accountable for their actions
in the future.

The combination of attention-seeking and impunity leads to REvil’s overconfidence. This can
be seen in the way REvil challenged the community’s ethics and principles, the arrogance
and contempt with which the REvil representatives talk to other hackers and ransomware
6/15

developers, and, finally, the way the group traits their victims. This overconfidence may be
the reason why the group is so hard to negotiate and so aggressive in their ways. But the
same overconfidence became the group’s major vulnerability.

Collective Identities

However, before we review how psychological patterns of UNKN and other leaders
determined their recent behavior, one other aspect would be investigated - the group identity.

REvil is first and foremost an organized crime collective and its group identity presents a
unique case across the organized crime. A recent solid trend in cybercrime psychology is for
previously ethnically homogenous crime groups that did not accept others have to begin to
accept individuals from different backgrounds, so they may contribute highly desirable scarce
resources and skills.
In 2019, groups started to operate across domains and cultural lines as long as the payload
could be ensured to be secured. The trend is especially visible with cybercrime. In contrast to
traditional organized crime that requires deep trust with strong ties and familiar connections,
cybercrime necessitates the formation of flexible networks and partnerships, forming a thin
trust.

For instance, across Eastern European cybercrime, Russian-speakers may prefer to work
with other Russian-speakers due to increased feelings of belongingness, preferences for
ethnic behaviors and practices, shared cultural traditions, history, and values. But they will
still establish multicultural and multiracial syndicates. An illustrative example was the FXMSP
group which bragged about having American and Chinese team members.

However, REvil is an exception. The group clearly says that it will never work with nonRussian speakers. REvil’s perceptions of, and attitudes toward, English-speakers members
ultimately develop from their need to identify with and belong to their own group that they
perceive to be superior, as a means of enhancing their level of self-esteem. REvil perceives
its group members and other trustworthy Russian-speaking actors to be similar to
themselves and shows preference in their attitudes and behaviors toward them.

selection

However, English-speakers are perceived to be dissimilar and possess less favorable
qualities, and therefore they can justifiably be discriminated against. Though Englishspeakers are lauded on the forums for making deals more secure by asking for as many
proofs as possible during deals, some stigmatize them for being difficult to make deals with.

This ethnic-based mentality and ethnic foundation for boundary formation had also misled
the group leaders. Just as overconfidence and impunity, this extreme psychological pattern
created new vulnerabilities for the group. As it often happens with collectives driven by
distrust to the “Collective Other”, REvil had hindered their critical thinking and began blaming
systemic vulnerabilities of their model on precedes against non-Russian speakers.

Confidence, Community, Consequences

8/15

Image 4: REvil’s latest activities were preceded by several important conflicts between the
group and the members of the cybercrime community

An Eastern European ransomware collective is first and foremost a community body. As a
decentralized structure, RaaS relies heavily on its talent recruitment. RaaS presumes the
necessity to keep a good relationship with the community. Recruitment of new affiliates,
cooperation with individual experts on intrusion, the infrastructure of publishing websites for
blackmailing - all this requires a solid foundation in the cybercrime community. Maintaining a
consistent reputational profile is, therefore, a necessity. When REvil members that bragged
about their success and power got themselves attacked, their entire foundation became
vulnerable.

9/15

The extravagant public profile turned REvil into a lucrative goal for other criminals.
“Vivalamuerte” clearly understood that reputation is as important for UNKN as their technical
skills. The extortion of REvil had a direct and traumatic impact on the group’s selfidentification. REvil relies on the acquisition of loyal, talented affiliates. They must keep a
reputable name in the forums in order to attract the right types of partners.

A threat of deanonymization simultaneously hit the three aspects of REvil’s collective
psychology mentioned above - attention-seeking, impunity, and overconfidence. With their
identity exposed, UNKN would find the attention they brought to themselves in a recent year
working against them. There would be no impunity without anonymity, and, of course, the
image of an overconfident gang leader would be destroyed if the information of their
personality is available for everyone.

UNKN and their team had to rapidly find a response to this triple threat aimed at the very
center of their collective psyche. As a result, they initiated a range of operations all aimed to
bring back their reputational standing but resulting in even further complications of their case.

A Spiral of Chaos

10/15

By Spring 2020, one of the largest and most formidable ransomware syndicates was in a
very pecunious condition. First, they face a deanonymization threat. Their attempt to call for
even more media attention now backfired and compromised the group’s impunity. Then, a
Russian-Speaking member of the syndicate accepts EXPL0 who ends up compromising the
group’s domains. Apparently - the identity-based model of partnerships proves itself
inefficient.

From a criminal psychology standpoint, REvil may have been willing to take overly confident
actions if they were really being extorted by Vivalamuerte and desired to protect their
anonymity at all costs. In order to extract a large payout, they were willing to act in more
chaotic ways, bluffing to have information on the U.S. President in order to extort a large
financial sum for information regarding Trump.

Image 5: An emphasis on publicity practiced by the group created an opposite reaction in the
cyber underground itself

A high-profile attack reaching headlines beyond regional media and social networks is a
perfect solution. REvil goes high and attempts to blackmail the U.S. President. Even though
this sounds like a movie plot, the plan works, but the consequences are imminent.

At this point REvil’s goals are simple - to restore the image of overconfident top-dog, trusted
and respected by the community - the main source of power that a RaaS syndicate has.

Indeed, REvil reached the global headlines, but the attack backfired. The group was being
branded as a terrorist organization by the Trump Administration which, among other things,
made ransom payment impossible. Previously fame and notoriety helped REvil to gain

11/15

profits. Their desire for attention and enrichment was working for hand by hand. But now, the
two motives were contradicting one another.

The blunder was easy to avoid as the consequences of an attack against President Trump
were quite predictable. The United States has branded smaller, less threatening (from a
standpoint of the US national security) groups, with much less of an impact as terrorists. A
couple of weeks before REvil’s extortion attempt, the Russian Imperialist Movement, a minor
white supremacy group already collapsing from the crackdown from Russian security forces,
was branded as a foreign terrorist organization by the US. The Russian-speaking media
extensively covered the event, accusing the US of overreaching. However, REvil ignored
these signs and targeted one of the most influential people in the world attempting to extort
the United States President for $42 million USD without proof of actually possessing
information about him.

While not being paid, UNKN and its team attempted to utilize at least one aspect of the
notorious extortion - popularity, and attention. They posted information regarding the
Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks on the underground forums.

However, again, the attempt led to the opposite effect. Instead of getting more respect and
support, REvil faced a backlash. Due to the nature of forum users’ activities, many wish to
keep a low profile and are uncomfortable with the amount of negative attention that REvil
draws to the forums by targeting Trump. In this sense, REvil's overall desire for attention
worked against them, since the community prefers silence.

An already damaged image of an omnipotent cyber syndicate, which was suddenly itself
blackmailed, received a second blow, as the community started to mock REvil and openly
ironize about their audacious threats. Moreover, REvil was called out for bluffing to have
information about Trump. As a result, the posts were quickly deleted from forums, but the
attempts to restore reputation continued as the group quickly shifted to announcing they
would be auctioning off celebrity client data obtained from GSMS, beginning with Madonna.

Exaggerating is not wise for building trust and legitimacy in this enterprise because those
buying the information will only purchase it if REvil’s track record is legitimate. Moreover,
REvil could have predicted the reaction of the community. By the way, the community

12/15

reacted to REvils bragging about attacks against medical corporations in the midst of the
COVID-19 Pandemic.

On March 13, 2020, REvil stole one terabyte of data from 10x Genomics, a California-based
biotechnological company, researching drugs to treat COVID-19. Following this ransomware
attack, the REvil group published 10X Genomics company documents containing sensitive
information about more than 1,200 employees. Some users on XSS did not agree with
REvil’s actions, declaring that biotechnology companies should be permitted to focus on cure
research so that everyone may be in good health. One user said “this act was like spitting in
the well from which one drinks. The faster humanity overcomes this infection, the faster the
economy will recover which will lead to bigger earnings for us.”

is an important rule affecting their code of conduct

At the same time, REvil in response to the EXPL0 case were reshifting its business model,
by reducing the number of affiliates and calling to ban English language users. Following the
EXPL0 breach in May, REvil removed all English adverts dealing with English speakers and
required a guaranteed advert for admission into their program. However, the EXPLO0 case
occurred not because of EXPL0’s identity, but because the RaaS model is itself vulnerable to
such breaches. REvil does not highlight that the RaaS system itself is at fault and opts to
scapegoat English-speaking users for the downfalls instead - another sign of irrational and
chaotic behavior.

However, these braggings and exaggerations, chaotic behavior can be explained if we take
the psychological and social components. It is critical for the crime syndicates to be
respected and supported, as they are consistently forming new partnerships on the forums.
Moreover, REvil leveraged fear through publicity by targeting A-listers. Standard personal
information is valuable but sensitive celebrity information is even more valuable. These
deeply impactful crimes get into the minds of their victims because celebrities and
13/15

companies alike know that if they do not pay that someone else will in an auction. REvil
worked its way to the top of the hierarchy by weaponizing their superior tactics, techniques,
and technology on the most public of figures.

This breach of trust by the community - the threat of losing anonymity triggered REvil to think
with more of a threat mindset which is essentially different from strategic management in
which the group operated previously. REvil was more motivated to commit a high-profile
attack to restore the group’s reputation after the Vivalamuerte extortion, to keep recruiting
talented members, and to increase the likelihood of a payout because other celebrities and
companies will be scared of the group since they are so popular and never caught. However
- high-profile attacks exacerbated the relationships with the community. As was the case with
the EXPL0 case breach, the clash between organizational and identity approaches leads to
poor mitigation.

By making each new attempt to improve their case, REvil only exacerbated the conflicts and
contradictions which led to their troubles in the first place.

What Can We Learn?

Socio-cultural forces play an important role in the genesis and sustainability of organized
cybercrime groups. Identity comprises motivators that direct criminal activities such as
emotions, beliefs, and attitudes. REvil achieves a sense of self-consistency by manifesting
their identity with their criminal behaviors, such as victimizing high-level targets,
accumulating technological prowess, and not allowing English speakers to work with them.
Collaborative ties require trust and mitigation of uncertainties as trust is a mechanism for
people to cope with risk and uncertainty in interactions with others.
In cybercriminal computer-mediated communications trust is more than just a mental aspect.
When REvil cooperates with someone on a forum, there is always a possibility that person is
either a fellow cybercriminal, a dishonest trader, a researcher, or a law enforcement
associate. Uncertainty is treated as a cost to the enterprise as a breach of trust can severely
impair their sophisticated business model. Bonding capital in crime is usually manifested
through strong interpersonal relationships with close friends or family. The next best thing to
develop trust is to possess the same ethnicity and values. In cybercrime, lacking non-verbal
and social context cues, trust becomes a valuable and scarce resource. This is why REvil

14/15

relies on having a shared ethnic background as well as two reputation-based systems that
mitigate uncertainty: reviewed vendors and escrow services - this group depends on a
collective community trust to operate.

A breach of trust, on the other hand, reverts the entire environment upside down. REvil are
unique in their approach as they are loud, extravagant, ethnically explicit, and invest in
decentralization practices. They use this extravagance to extort ransom and obtain respect.
Yet, when their relationships with they can not trust the community and the community do not
trust them, the same psychological and behavioral patterns that enable them to be creative
and unique make them more prone to being caught, more vulnerable psychologically, and
more chaotic in mitigating crisis.

REvil is most certainly far from collapsing, but the recent complications with the public and
with the criminal community have revealed some important trends. REvil’s operations just as
their predecessor GandCrab were heavily based on the exploitation of fears, pride, and
vanity. These groups need attention to prosper. But if such syndicates receive too much
negative attention from targeting authoritative figures such as the U.S. President, or making
too much noise in the community, they may have to effortfully retire or rebrand again.
Apparently, this was what happened with GandCrab, and this is the paradox of attention,
embedded in the fabric of these gang’s operations.

Seeing as how UNKN has changed his name 4 times in the past and GandCrab changed
their practices after receiving too much fame, it is likely that REvil will only succeed with this
name for so long before having to make significant changes to their name, identity, and code.
REvil can only work for so long attacking such well-known targets. Trust, professionalism,
and technological proficiency are more important to REvil now than ever. This organization is
running on limited time if they have already rebranded once with some of the same people
and some of the same code. The same story can repeat.
