The US is protected by what’s known as a nuclear triad: a three-pronged attack force that
consists of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear missiles on submarines, and aircraft
equipped with nuclear bombs and missiles.
One of the triad’s legs – the land-based LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) – has been kicked by hackers who’ve inflicted Maze ransomware on the computer
network of a Northrup Grumman contractor.
Sky News reported on Wednesday that the contractor, Westech International, has confirmed
that it’s been hacked and that its computers have been encrypted. It’s not yet clear if the
extortionists managed to steal classified military information. Investigations to identify exactly
what they got away with are still ongoing.
However, the attackers have already leaked files that suggest they had access to sensitive
data – including payroll and emails – that they copied before they encrypted it, Sky News
reports. They’re threatening to publish all of the files.
Unauthorized access to data about intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles would be bad
enough, but depending on what the attackers accessed, the attack could have yet more
serious repercussions, given Westech’s client list.

That list includes US military branches, government infrastructure agencies, and major
military contractors, including the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, Joint Service Agencies, the
Commerce Department, the Energy Department, the General Services Administration, Booz
Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics Information Technology, Lockheed Martin Information
Technology, and more.

Minuteman III missiles
Minuteman III missiles are stored in hundreds of protected underground launch facilities
operated by the Air Force Global Strike Command. Westech reportedly provides Northrup
Grumman with engineering and maintenance support for the missiles.
Each ICBM contains multiple thermonuclear warheads that can be delivered further than
6,000 miles: roughly, about one-fourth of the planet’s circumference or, as Sky News notes,
the distance between London and Buenos Aires. They can hit speeds of up to Mach 23:
that’s 17,508 miles/28,176 kilometers per hour.
The time frame of the attack, extortion demands and publishing of Westech’s sensitive data
haven’t been disclosed. The firm told Sky News that it immediately initiated an investigation
and contained its systems after learning about the hack. It’s also working with an
independent computer forensic firm to “analyze its systems for any compromise and to
determine if any personal information is at risk.”
Northrup Grumman and the Department of Defense (DoD) reportedly declined to comment.

About Maze
Maze ransomware is a new-ish ransomware strain that’s also been used recently against
Cognizant, a large US IT services company that disclosed that it had fallen victim in April.
Westech International is just the latest in a string of Maze attacks. As SophosLabs described
last month in a report – titled Maze ransomware: extorting victims for 1 year and
counting – Maze has been in the news quite frequently recently, notably because the gang
who created it have been in the vanguard of a new wave of “double-whammy” ransomware
attacks.
Here’s how it works, according to Naked Security’s Paul Ducklin: The crooks confront you
with not one but two reasons to pay the extortion money:
Pay up to get the decryption key to recover your precious files, which we
scrambled with the malware.
Pay up to stop us releasing your precious files, which we took copies of before we
scrambled them.

Westech’s saga is in keeping with how Maze operators work: they follow through on threats
of public exposure of stolen data by posting it in public data dumps – what are also known as
name-and-shame sites. If no payment is forthcoming, they’ll offer it up on cybercrime forums.
From the SophosLabs report:
The Maze gang has made public exposure central to their ‘brand’ identity, and actively
seeks attention from press and researchers to promote their brand—and make it easy
for victims who might hesitate to pay them to find out their reputation.
“Brand identity?” Oh, yes, in all its animated glory. The ransomware has been around for
more than a year, though it was originally known simply as ChaCha, after the encryption
algorithm it used. In May 2019, its criminal operators adopted its current name, Maze, and
have come up with their own visual branding:

How the Maze virus greets victims on its website.
I checked in with Westech International on Wednesday to see how it’s doing with its
recovery, whether there’s any update on its investigation, and what the contractor’s thinking
might be vis-a-vis paying the ransom – a sum that hasn’t been disclosed. I’ll update this
article if I hear back.

Pay or pray?

The answer, in a nutshell, is Please Don’t Pay. There are very good reasons not to.
According to the State of Ransomware 2020 global study conducted earlier this year on
Sophos’s behalf, paying ransoms costs more than reinstating data using backups.
You might well ask how that could be, given that downtime is often cited as the most
expensive part of a ransomware attack. The rationale is simply that the cost of recovery is
always high, coming in at an average of $732,000. Paying the ransom on top of that simply
doubles the bill.
As noted by Naked Security’s John E. Dunn, this explains why extortionists almost always
send back encryption keys when paid: if they didn’t, then victims’ doubt would “quickly
destroy the whole extortion racket as companies knuckled down to do the hard work
themselves.”
That could explain why ransomware attackers are increasingly threatening to leak sensitive
data stolen during the attack, as was done in the Westech incident: the threat is an added
incentive to pay up.

What to do?
Organizations shouldn’t despair. There are ways to limit the effect of ransomware attacks.
The first step: assume that an attack is inevitable, and prepare for it.
Our advice:
Make and test a backup plan, including storing data offsite where attackers can’t
locate it.
If you’re buying cyber-insurance, make sure it covers ransomware.
Don’t forget to protect data in the cloud as well as central data.
Use dedicated anti-ransomware protection. Twenty-four percent of survey
respondents that were hit by ransomware were able to stop the attack before the data
could be encrypted.
Lock down Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Criminal gangs exploit weak RDP
credentials to launch targeted ransomware attacks. Turn off RDP if you don’t need it,
and use rate limiting, two-factor authentication (2FA) or a virtual private network (VPN)
if you do.
Pick strong passwords and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) as often as
possible. And don’t re-use passwords, ever.
Patch early, patch often. Ransomware like WannaCry and NotPetya relied on
unpatched vulnerabilities to spread around the globe.
It’s also worth reading Naked Security’s advice on common mistakes that make ransomware
easier to pull off from the attacker’s point of view. For more detailed advice, please check out
