Taking Action Against Hackers in China

Facebook threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide
range of threats including cyber espionage campaigns, influence operations and hacking of
our platform by nation-state actors and other groups. As part of these efforts, our teams
routinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying users if they should take
steps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the
security of our products.
Today, we’re sharing actions we took against a group of hackers in China known in the
security industry as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye — to disrupt their ability to use their
infrastructure to abuse our platform, distribute malware and hack people’s accounts across
the internet. They targeted activists, journalists and dissidents predominantly among
Uyghurs from Xinjiang in China primarily living abroad in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United

States, Syria, Australia, Canada and other countries. This group used various cyber
espionage tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable
surveillance.
This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation while obfuscating
who’s behind it. On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in
sending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself. We saw
this activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies’
actions to disrupt their activity.
We identified the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat
actor across the internet:
Selective targeting and exploit protection: This group took steps to conceal their
activity and protect malicious tools by only infecting people with iOS malware when
they passed certain technical checks, including IP address, operating system, browser
and country and language settings.
Compromising and impersonating news websites: This group set up malicious
websites that used look-alike domains for popular Uyghur and Turkish news sites. They
also appeared to have compromised legitimate websites frequently visited by their
targets as part of watering hole attacks. A watering hole attack is when hackers infect
websites frequently visited by intended targets to compromise their devices. Some of
these web pages contained malicious javascript code that resembled previously
reported exploits, which installed iOS malware known as INSOMNIA on people’s
devices once they were compromised.
Social engineering: This group used fake accounts on Facebook to create fictitious
personas posing as journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the
Uyghur community to build trust with people they targeted and trick them into clicking
on malicious links.
Using fake third party app stores: We found websites set up by this group that mimic
third-party Android app stores where they published Uyghur-themed applications,
including a keyboard app, prayer app, and dictionary app. These apps were trojanized
(contained malware that misled people of its true intent) with two Android malware
strains — ActionSpy or PluginPhantom.
Outsourcing malware development: We’ve observed this group use several distinct
Android malware families. Specifically, our investigation and malware analysis found
that Beijing Best United Technology Co., Ltd. (Best Lh) and Dalian 9Rush Technology
Co., Ltd. (9Rush), two Chinese companies, are the developers behind some of the
Android tooling deployed by this group. Our assessment of one of them benefited from
research by FireEye, a cybersecurity company. These China-based firms are likely part
of a sprawling network of vendors, with varying degrees of operational security.

Industry tracking: Our industry peers have been tracking parts of this activity as being
driven by a single threat actor broadly known as Earth Empusa, or Evil Eye,
or PoisonCarp. Our investigation confirmed that the activity we are disrupting today
closely aligns with the first two — Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. While PoisonCarp shares
some TTPs including targeting and use of some of the same vendor-developed
malware, our on-platform analysis suggests that it is a separate cluster of activity.
We shared our findings and threat indicators with industry peers so they too can detect and
stop this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked malicious domains from being shared
on our platform, took down the group’s accounts and notified people who we believe were
targeted by this threat actor.
