Echobot Malware Now up to 71 Exploits, Targeting
SCADA

December 17, 2019

F5 Networks researchers have detected a new variant of the "Echobot" malware, now
consisting of 71 exploits. The authors continue to follow the trend of arming the malware and
for the threat group to expand its operation. These newly added exploits target both old and
new vulnerabilities, adding as new ones target industrial control system devices from
Mitsubishi, Barracuda web app firewall, Citrix NetScaler application delivery controllers,
video conferencing systems, and additional network and endpoint administration tools.
Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks1 reported a new variant from the Mirai malware family,
dubbed "Echobot" after the dropped file name of the malware. Initial versions of the malware
used 26 exploits to propagate itself. Later in August of 2019 it was reported2 to go over 50
exploits. So at 71 we are seeing substantial growth in Echobot’s attack capability.

New Target: Factory Automation Systems
Although the core malware functionality of this latest variant hasn't changed much since
inception, the addition of a variety of new exploits puts new systems into its crosshairs.
While most of the Mirai variants target IoT devices, such as home routers and IP cameras,
this version of Echobot adds an outstanding exploit for CVE-2019-14927, which targets
Mitsubishi Electric‘s Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).

The Mitsubishi RTU3 is an industrial controller with remote access to communicate with
SCADA systems in the oil and gas industry, power industry, and others. Industrial control
systems have seen an increase in attacks over the past years4, including some chilling
suggestions of possible cyber-terrorism attacks5. However, it is uncommon for generalpurpose botnets like Mirai to include exploits targeting a specific component such as the
Mitsubishi RTU. Figure 1 below shows the product web page for the Mitsubishi smartRTU.
While industrial controller systems are essential components responsible for running critical
infrastructure, they were never designed to be Internet-connected and are therefore
notoriously known for security-related flaws. Echobot leverages that weakness, making it
more dangerous than before.

Figure 1. Web page for the Mitsubishi smartRTU
In September 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an alert6, shown in
Figure 2, to address Mitsubishi's RTU vulnerability. The alert followed a publication of a
proof-of-concept exploit by a researcher known as @xerubus7, who discovered and
responsibly reported this vulnerability.

Figure 2. Department of Homeland Security vulnerability alert page
Industrial control systems are known to be very difficult to patch due to the risks involved
while introducing configuration changes to critical infrastructure systems. This means there is
a larger vulnerability exposure window, compared to traditional IT systems, which provides
attackers with a much larger opportunity to exploit new vulnerabilities.

Analysis of the Exploits
In the beginning, Echobot consisted of a very odd mix of exploits.8 Initial Mirai variants
targeted IoT devices, such as home routers, digital surveillance cameras, and cable
modems. Over time, the targets extended to smart devices and web servers. Echobot is a
very prominent variant in the Mirai landscape, adding to its prey: corporate network devices,
network and enterprise management systems, video conferencing, voice over IP, and Iris
recognition platforms (as shown in Figure 3). This new Echobot variant builds upon that with
similar newer systems, while also adding another old exploit for the Barracuda firewall and
for the Citrix NetScaler application delivery controller.

Often, Mirai variants add relatively current exploits to get better chances to recruit devices.
However, this version leverages an exploit from 2003, targeting the online payment platform
CCBill. At the same time, Echobot added four exploits to its arsenal from 2019, while the
latest one is from August 2019, targeting Webmin Linux/Unix administration panel (CVE2019-15107). This indicates the authors are looking to exploit both legacy and new systems
that have fallen through the cracks in a patch management program. The newly added
exploits to Echobot are listed in Table 1 as well as in Figure 4:

Attack Infrastructure
Echobot uses its arsenal to spread a dropper, which is a bash script named "Richard,"
detailed in Figure 5. The dropper instructs the system to download Echobot and compile and
execute it for no fewer than 13 different processor architectures. These hacked servers are
then used to host and spread more malware to new targets, adding more machines to the
botnet.

5/8

The Echobot malware itself is hosted on a different server than previously reported. The
malware hosting server is now a hacked Unraid network attached storage (NAS) system that
is completely exposed, allowing anyone to gain full admin access using a user-friendly GUI
terminal.
Not surprisingly, these servers were taken over by malicious actors, but it is unknown exactly
how the server was exploited. However, it appears that SSH and Telnet services are
exposed without any password required. Also, Mirai is known for having credential bruteforce capabilities, so this is likely the attackers’ entry point.
Reviewing the files on that system, seen in Figure 6, it seems that the attackers just recently
(12/10/2019) uploaded the new malware variant to the hacked server:

Figure 6. New malware variant added to the hacked server
The other attacking Echobot IPs appear to be infected web servers mostly located in the
U.S. and in Europe. Half of those servers are hosted on DreamHost. An example of an
infected web server is shown in Figure 7. The services running on the servers are not
vectors in the malware's arsenal so they were most likely were brute-forced to gain control of
them.

Conclusion
Mirai has been around for a few years now, and variants of the original malware have been
used all over the world to create botnets. F5 Labs recently wrote in its ongoing “Hunt for IoT”
research series that devices are so easy to compromise, preteens are doing it. There is no
sign that IoT botnets will disappear anytime soon, and we expect new variants to keep
appearing. Echobot remains a threat, and the expanding scope of its exploits indicates it will
not be slowing down anytime soon. Echobot's shifting focus to factory automation is notable
and may indicate a future direction for botnet-building threat actors.
To keep the threat at bay, enterprises should consider implementing a patch management
system in order to mitigate the risk of vulnerable systems on their networks.
