One of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the

number of groups adopting “living off the land” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of
operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise
victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and

tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea

of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is
detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s
more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and
leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of
discovery.

Finding the needle in the haystack
This doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that
they can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec
created Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve
developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat
Protection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine
learning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns
associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have
taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our
customers, to find that needle in the haystack.
It was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in
January 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An
attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s
network. PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems
and is one of the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers
attempting to live off the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes,
meaning malicious use of PsExec can be difficult to spot.
TAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were

using it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of
malware on computers within the victim’s network. When we analyzed the malware, we
discovered that it was an updated version of Trojan.Rikamanu, malware associated with
Thrip, a group we’ve been monitoring since 2013. After further investigation, we discovered
that Thrip also used a completely new piece of malware in this attack
(Infostealer.Catchamas).

Figure 1. Targeted Attack Analytics leverages machine learning to spot malicious activity
associated with targeted attacks and alerts the customer.

Armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used
against this victim, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that
indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We uncovered a wide-ranging cyber
espionage campaign involving powerful malware being used against targets that are a
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

cause for concern.
We identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s
motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial
imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia.

Eye on the sky: Thrip’s targets
Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite
communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the
operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that
monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying
and may also include disruption.
Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again,
Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted
computers running MapXtreme GIS (Geographic Information System) software which is
used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating locationbased data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server
and Garmin imaging software.
The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In
all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the
telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.
In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.

Attempting to hide in plain sight
We’ve been monitoring Thrip since 2013 when we uncovered a spying campaign being
orchestrated from systems based in China. Since our initial discovery, the group has
changed its tactics and broadened the range of tools it used. Initially, it relied heavily on
custom malware, but in this most recent wave of attacks, which began in 2017, the group
has switched to a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools. The latter
include:
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

PsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The tool
was primarily used by the attackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.
PowerShell: Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download
payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.
Mimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security
certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext.
WinSCP: Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.
LogMeIn: Cloud-based remote access software. It’s unclear whether the attackers
gained unauthorized access to the victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created
their own.
All of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously),
have legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the
vast majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems
administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention.
Through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot
patterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was
being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its
cover.
While Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

malware, particularly against computers of interest. This includes:
Trojan.Rikamanu: A custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected
computer, including credentials and system information.
Infostealer.Catchamas: Based on Rikamanu, this malware contains additional features
designed to avoid detection. It also includes a number of new capabilities, such as the
ability to capture information from newer applications (such as new or updated web
browsers) that have emerged since the original Trojan.Rikamanu malware was created.
Trojan.Mycicil: A keylogger known to be created by underground Chinese hackers.
Although publicly available, it is not frequently seen.
Backdoor.Spedear: Although not seen in this recent wave of attacks, Spedear is a
backdoor Trojan that has been used by Thrip in other campaigns.
Trojan.Syndicasec: Another Trojan used by Thrip in previous campaigns.

Highly targeted espionage operation
From the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled
us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers
within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage
is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it
could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.
