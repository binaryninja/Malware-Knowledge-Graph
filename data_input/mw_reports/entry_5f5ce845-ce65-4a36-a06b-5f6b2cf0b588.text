Buckeye: Espionage Outﬁt Used Equation Group Tools Prior to Shadow
Brokers Leak

Key Findings
The Buckeye attack group was using Equation Group tools to gain persistent access to target
organizations at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak.
Variants of Equation Group tools used by Buckeye appear to be different from those released by
Shadow Brokers, potentially indicating a different origin.
Buckeye's use of Equation Group tools also involved the exploit of a previously unknown Windows
zero-day vulnerability. This zero day was reported by Symantec to Microsoft in September 2018 and
patched in March 2019.
While Buckeye appeared to cease operations in mid-2017, the Equation Group tools it used
continued to be used in attacks until late 2018. It is unknown who continued to use the tools. They
may have been passed to another group or Buckeye may have continued operating longer than
supposed.
The 2017 leak of Equation Group tools by a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers was one of
the most signiﬁcant cyber security stories in recent years. Equation is regarded as one of the most
technically adept espionage groups and the release of a trove of its tools had a major impact, with many
attackers rushing to deploy the malware and exploits disclosed. One of these tools, the EternalBlue exploit,
was used to devastating effect in the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware outbreak.
However, Symantec has now found evidence that the Buckeye cyber espionage group (aka APT3, Gothic
Panda) began using Equation Group tools in attacks at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak.

Beginning in March 2016, Buckeye began using a variant of DoublePulsar (Backdoor.Doublepulsar), a
backdoor that was subsequently released by the Shadow Brokers in 2017. DoublePulsar was delivered to
victims using a custom exploit tool (Trojan.Bemstour) that was speciﬁcally designed to install DoublePulsar.
Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on
targeted computers. One vulnerability is a Windows zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703) discovered by
Symantec. The second Windows vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) was patched in March 2017 after it was
discovered to have been used by two exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were also
released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak.
The zero-day vulnerability allows for the leaking of information and can be exploited in conjunction with
other vulnerabilities to attain remote kernel code execution. It was reported by Symantec to Microsoft in
September 2018 and was patched on March 12, 2019.
How Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak remains
unknown.
Buckeye disappeared in mid-2017 and three alleged members of the group were indicted in the U.S. in
November 2017. However, while activity involving known Buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017, the Bemstour
exploit tool and the DoublePulsar variant used by Buckeye continued to be used until at least September
2018 in conjunction with different malware.

History of attacks
The Buckeye attack group had been active since at least 2009, when it began mounting a string of
espionage attacks, mainly against organizations based in the U.S.

The group has a record of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. These include CVE-2010-3962 as part of an
attack campaign in 2010 and CVE-2014-1776 in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks have been
reported, they have not been conﬁrmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits known, or suspected, to have
been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash.

Timeline of attacks
Beginning in August 2016, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began releasing tools it claimed to
have originated from the Equation Group. It initially released samples of the information it had, offering the
full trove to the highest bidder. Over the coming months, it progressively released more tools, until April
2017, when it released a ﬁnal, large cache of tools, including the DoublePulsar backdoor, the FuzzBunch
framework, and the EternalBlue, EternalSynergy, and EternalRomance exploit tools.
However, Buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand. The
earliest known use of Equation Group tools by Buckeye is March 31, 2016, during an attack on a target in
Hong Kong. During this attack, the Bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known Buckeye
malware (Backdoor.Pirpi). One hour later, Bemstour was used against an educational institution in Belgium.
Bemstour is speciﬁcally designed to deliver a variant of the DoublePulsar backdoor. DoublePulsar is then
used to inject a secondary payload, which runs in memory only. The secondary payload enables the
attackers to access the affected computer even after DoublePulsar is removed. It is worth noting that earlier
versions did not include any means of uninstalling the DoublePulsar implant. This functionality was added
in later versions.
A signiﬁcantly improved variant of the Bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in September 2016, when it was
used in an attack against an educational institution in Hong Kong. While the original variant was only
capable of exploiting 32-bit systems, the new variant could exploit both 32-bit and 64-bit targets, adding
support for newer Windows versions. Another new feature of the payload in the second variant allowed the
attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the infected computer. This custom payload is also
designed to copy arbitrary ﬁles and execute arbitrary processes on the targeted computer. When used
against 32-bit targets, Bemstour still delivered the same DoublePulsar backdoor. However, against 64-bit
targets it delivered only the custom payload. The attackers typically used it to execute shell commands that
created new user accounts.
Bemstour was used again in June 2017 in an attack against an organization in Luxembourg. Unlike earlier
attacks when Bemstour was delivered using Buckeye’s Pirpi backdoor, in this attack Bemstour was
delivered to the victim by a different backdoor Trojan (Backdoor.Filensfer). Between June and September
2017, Bemstour was also used against targets in the Philippines and Vietnam.
Development of Bemstour has continued into 2019. The most recent sample of Bemstour seen by
Symantec appears to have been compiled on March 23, 2019, eleven days after the zero-day vulnerability
was patched by Microsoft.
The purpose of all the attacks was to acquire a persistent presence on the victim’s network, meaning
information theft was the most likely motive of the attacks.

Table 1. Buckeye Tool Usage Over Time

The Filensfer connection
Filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013. Symantec has
found multiple versions of the malware, including a C++ version, a compiled Python version (using py2exe),
and a PowerShell version.
Over the past three years, Filensfer has been deployed against organizations in Luxembourg, Sweden,
Italy, the UK, and the U.S. Targets included organizations in the telecoms, media, and manufacturing
sectors. While Symantec has never observed the use of Filensfer alongside any known Buckeye tools,
information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of Filensfer being used in conjunction
with known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi).

Bemstour exploit tool
Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on
targeted computers.
The zero-day vulnerability found and reported by Symantec (CVE-2019-0703) occurs due to the way the
Windows SMB Server handles certain requests. The vulnerability allows for the leaking of information.
The second vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) is a message type confusion vulnerability. When the two
vulnerabilities are exploited together, the attacker can gain full access in the form of kernel mode code
execution, enabling them to deliver malware to the targeted computer.
When Bemstour was ﬁrst used in 2016, both vulnerabilities were zero days, although CVE-2017-0143 was
subsequently patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010). CVE-2017-0143 was also used by two
other exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were released as part of the Shadow
Brokers leak in April 2017.
Buckeye's exploit tool, EternalRomance, as well as EternalSynergy, can exploit the CVE-2017-0143
message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim computers. In
order to obtain remote code execution capabilities, all three exploit tools needed to collect information
about the memory layout of attacked systems in addition to exploiting the aforementioned message type
confusion vulnerability. Each tool performed this differently, relying on different vulnerabilities. In the case of
the Buckeye exploit tool, the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703).

The variant of DoublePulsar used in the ﬁrst attacks performed by Buckeye was different to that leaked by
the Shadow Brokers. It appears to contain code to target newer versions of Windows (Windows 8.1 and
Windows Server 2012 R2), indicating that it is a newer version of the malware. It also includes an additional
layer of obfuscation. Based on technical features and timing, it is possible that this obfuscation was created
by DoublePulsar's original authors.
It is noteworthy that the attackers never used the FuzzBunch framework in its attacks. FuzzBunch is a
framework designed to manage DoublePulsar and other Equation Group tools and was leaked by the
Shadow Brokers in 2017. This suggests that Buckeye only managed to gain access to a limited number of
Equation Group tools.

Unanswered questions
There are multiple possibilities as to how Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools before the Shadow
Brokers leak. Based on the timing of the attacks and the features of the tools and how they are constructed,
one possibility is that Buckeye may have engineered its own version of the tools from artefacts found in
captured network trafﬁc, possibly from observing an Equation Group attack. Other less supported

scenarios, given the technical evidence available, include Buckeye obtaining the tools by gaining access to
an unsecured or poorly secured Equation Group server, or that a rogue Equation group member or
associate leaked the tools to Buckeye.
Mystery also surrounds the continued use of the exploit tool and DoublePulsar after Buckeye's apparent
disappearance. It may suggest that Buckeye retooled following its exposure in 2017, abandoning all tools
publicly associated with the group. However, aside from the continued use of the tools, Symantec has
found no other evidence suggesting Buckeye has retooled. Another possibility is that Buckeye passed on
some of its tools to an associated group.
