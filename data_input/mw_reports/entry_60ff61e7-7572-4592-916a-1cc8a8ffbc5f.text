In June 2016, Unit 42 published the blog post “Tracking Elirks Variants in Japan: Similarities to
Previous Attacks”, in which we described the resemblance of attacks using the Elirks malware
family in Japan and Taiwan.
Since then, we continued tracking this threat using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus and

attachments. The identified targets include three separate Japanese trading companies, a
Japanese petroleum company, a mobile phone organization based in Japan, the Beijing office of
a public organization of Japan, and a government agency in Taiwan.

Figure 1 shows the number of attacks considered as a part of the MILE TEA campaign since
2011. As we can see, the volume of the threats is small in total.

The primary infection vector is a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment. Although we
collected several document based exploit files (RTF, XLS, and PDF) in this attack campaign,
most of the attachments were executable files that, interestingly, suggest a custom malware
installer. Attackers often use self-extracting executable files or existing installer packages to

reduce development costs if they require dropping multiple files. However, in this campaign, the
attacker group created its own installer program with the following features:
Windows executable with folder icon
Creates directory with pre-determined name in the same path as the installer
Copies decoy files into the created directory
Installs a batch file and malware on Temp Dir
Executes a batch script to delete the installer
Figure 3 shows examples of the custom installer and its different folder icons.

The use of e-flight tickets as phishing lures has been seen repeatedly for a number of years.
The following is the list of malicious attachment samples that use this technique. It is the most
prevalent lure used by this threat actor to entice targets for this campaign.

Table 1 Samples of malicious attachments masquerading as E-Ticket

In this MILE TEA campaign, the actor uses the following three malware families as the initial
infection by the custom installer. The primary purpose of these families is to establish a
bridgehead, collecting system information and downloading additional malware from a remote
server.

Table 2 Malware characteristics
While many security vendors classify these samples as different malware families, they share
functionality, code, and infrastructure, leading us to conclude that they in fact belong to the
previously mentioned malware families.

As described in the previous blog post, one of the unique features of Elirks is that it retrieves a
command and control (C2) address from a public-facing blog service. When configured, the
malware accesses a predetermined blog page, discovers a specific string, and proceeds to
decode it with Base64 and decrypts it using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) cipher. The
same functionality is found in Logedrut, however, instead of using the TEA cipher, it uses DES.
A sample of Logedrut
(afe57a51c5b0e37df32282c41da1fdfa416bbd9f32fa94b8229d6f2cc2216486) accesses a free
blog service hosted in Japan and reads the following article posted by the threat actor.

Figure 4 Encoded C2 address posted by attacker
The routine called GetAddressByBlog() in Logedrut looks for text between two pre-defined
strings. In this particular case, the malware sample will look for test between “doctor fish” and
“sech yamatala”. The threat determines encoded text is
“pKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+” and proceeds to handle it using the following
function.

Figure 5 Code finding encoded C2 address from blog
This code deciphers the string with BASE64 and DES. So far all Logedrut samples use exactly
the same key, 1q2w3e4r, for decryption. The following Python code can be used to decode the
C2 address.

import base64

encoded_string = "pKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+"
iv = key = "1q2w3e4r"
decoded_string = base64.b64decode(encoded_string)
des = Crypto.Cipher.DES.new(key, Crypto.Cipher.DES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted_string = des.decrypt(decoded_string)
print decrypted_string

Elirks and Micrass employ exactly the same TEA cipher. TEA is a block cipher that operates
against 64-bit (8 bytes) of data at a time to encrypt and decrypt. The author of the code added
and extra cipher operation by XORing data when a block size is less than 64 bits. For example,
if the encrypted data length is 248 bits (31 bytes), the code in both malware samples decrypts
the first three blocks (64 x 3 = 192 bits) with TEA. The final block is only 56 bits (248 – 192 =
56), so the code uses a simple XOR operation against the remaining data. This supplement to
TEA has not been widely used, and all Elirks and Micrass samples have the same static key
(2D 4E 51 67 D5 52 3B 75) for the XOR operation. Due to these similarities, we can conclude
that the author of both families may be the same, or has access to the same source code.

Figure 6 TEA with XOR Cipher in Elirks and Micrass

Based on our analysis, we see that only a handful samples share the same infrastructure
directly. The threat actors carefully minimize reusing C2 domains and IP addresses among their
malware samples, and yet they prefer using servers located in Hong Kong no matter where the
target resides.

Figure 7 Location of C2 servers

We found a spear phishing email sent to a government agency in Taiwan on March 2015. The
email sender masquerades as an airline company, and the RAR archive attachment contains
the custom installer named Ticket.exe that drops Ticket.doc and Micrass malware.

Figure 8 Spear-phishing email sent to an agency in Taiwan
During the analysis of the email, we came across an article in a Taiwan newspaper from
February 2014 that alerted the public about a similar email message being widely distributed
that contained a malicious attachment. The only difference between the email messages in
Figure 8 and in the news article was the date. The adversary reused the email message more
than a year ago.

The most interesting part of this attack campaign is that the threat actor has been using stolen
documents from previously compromised organizations to perform additional attacks since early
2015. These documents are not publicly available nor do they look to be created from scratch by
the attacker. Because they contain sensitive data tying to the specific business, it is unlikely that
a third party would be able to craft them.
The following figure shows the decoy file installed by a sample identified in early April 2015. The
file is a weekly report created at the end of March 2015 by a salesperson at a Japanese trading
company. The report includes various sensitive information specific to their business.

Figure 9 Weekly report from a Japanese trading company
The properties identified within the document indicate that the company name matches the
context, and the person who last modified it is the same individual seen in the document itself.
Because of this, the file appears legitimate and it’s very unlikely that this document would ever
be made publicly available. The threat actor almost certainly stole this document soon after it
was created, and reused it as the decoy for next target within a week of the theft.

Figure 10 Property of the decoy document
Another installer found in Japan in May 2015 also contained sensitive information. The decoy
looks to be a draft version of a legitimate contract addendum between the subsidiary of a
Japanese petroleum company based in Australia, and a China-based company. The document
provides details of the deal, including price. It contains a bunch of tracked changes by what
appears to be two Japanese speaking individuals. We have confirmed that one of the individuals
was a manager of an overseas project of the parent company in Japan by the official release of

personnel change in 2013. The file is also considered to be stolen from a target organization
and used for decoy for the next attack.

Figure 11 Contract addendum decoy file
In addition to those examples, we found the following decoy files that are likely stolen from
previously compromised organizations.
Organization

Beijing Office of a public organization of

Budget Report

Japan

Internal investigation document

Mobile phone organization in Japan

Inventory of new smartphones

Table 3 Potential source of another decoy file
We cannot confirm whether those files were stolen as part of the MILE TEA campaign or not.
Either way, it’s difficult to imagine that the threat actor sent those internal documents to entirely
different organization or industries. One plausible explanation would be that the threat actors
target different persons or departments within same organization or industry.

So far, we have described two trading companies in Japan that are possibly targeted. In addition
to these two companies, there is another company in Japan that could be involved in the attack
campaign as well. A sample of Logedrut was identified and is capable of communicating with C2
through an internal proxy server in the compromised organization. The sample contains an
internal proxy address for a trading company in Japan as seen in String7 in the image below.
Thus, the sample is specially crafted for this specific enterprise.

Figure 12 Internal proxy address in Logedrut

MILE TEA is five-year-long targeted attack campaign focused on businesses and government
agencies in Asia Pacific and Japan. The threat actor behind this maintains and uses multiple

malware families, including a custom installer. The actor is interested in organizations that
conduct business in multiple countries. The trading companies cover an immensely broad area,
from commodity products to aviation around the world. Another possible target is a Japanese
petroleum company that has multiple offices and subsidiary companies in overseas countries. A
public organization in Japan and a government agency in Taiwan were also targeted.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:
1. WildFire accurately identifies all malware samples related to this operation as malicious.
2. Domains used by this operation have been flagged as malicious in Threat Prevention.
3. AutoFocus users can view malware related to this attack using the “Micrass”, “Elirks“, and
