After awakening last week and starting to send spam worldwide, Emotet is now once again
installing the TrickBot trojan on infected Windows computers.
On July 17th, 2020, after over five months of inactivity, the Emotet Trojan woke up and
started massive spam campaigns pretending to be payment reports, invoices, shipping
information, and employment opportunities.

Current Emotet campaign
These spam emails contain malicious documents that will install the Emotet trojan on the
recipient's computer when opened and macros enabled.
Historically, once a user became infected with Emotet, the trojan would eventually download
and install the TrickBot trojan on the infected computer.
It wasn't until today, though, that Binary Defense researcher James Quinn told
BleepingComputer that he began to see Emotet once again installing the TrickBot trojan.

TrickBot and why it is so dangerous
TrickBot is an advanced malware that infects Windows machines and is commonly seen
targeting enterprise networks.
What makes TrickBot so dangerous is that it will download modules that perform various
malicious activities on an infected computer.
This activity includes:

Attempting to spread laterally through a network
Steal Active Directory Services databases
Harvest login credentials and cookies from browsers
Steal OpenSSH keys
Steals RDP, VNC, and Putty credentials
Steals banking credentials
Even worse, though, once TrickBot has finished harvesting anything of value from a
compromised network, it will open up a reverse shell to the Ryuk and Conti Ransomware
actors.
This reverse shell will allow the ransomware operators to access the network, steal
unencrypted files, and then deploy their ransomware to encrypt all of the network's
machines.
Network and security administrators need to be sure users on their network are educated
adequately on Emotet spam campaigns and not open any suspicious documents.
Furthermore, if a computer becomes compromised by Emotet, likely, they are also
compromised by TrickBot.
A full investigation should be launched, which includes assessing whether the infections
have spread to other computers on the network.
