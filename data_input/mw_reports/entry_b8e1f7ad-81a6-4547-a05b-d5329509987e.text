(Part 2 of 3) In this 3-part post, we share the tradecraft from an RDP brute force linked
ransomware event (MedusaLocker) we responded to in June 2020. We cover the business
ramifications of the attack, technical analysis and some advice based on attacks such as
these.
Continued from part 1...
Persistence
No specific persistence events were observed; it assessed that these intruders likely rely on
tempo of operations and low-security posture of the victim to complete their objectives before
being evicted.
Interestingly the earliest reference to the SVHOST task that executed the ransomware was
at 16/06/2020 4:58:11 pm; even though most of the adversary activity was conducted later at
17/06/2020 3:00 to 4:00 am. This potentially represented a minimum viable (aka local)

ransomware deployment in case the actors were detected and lost access to the host. Given
the ~10hr time offset this may also represent a geographically distributed set of intrusion
operators involved.
Privilege Escalation
The admin account compromised already had Domain Administer rights (T1110), so no
privilege escalation was strictly necessary. Nonetheless, Theta observed the
Domain\Administrator (S-1-5-21domain-500) account utilised by the intruder for lateral
movement and reconnaissance. However, the exact mechanism these credentials were
obtained with was not observed (other reporting suggests mimikatz staged in the
`kamikadze` folder). Theta also observed the use of NT\SYSTEM (with
C:\Windows\syswow64\config\systemprofile storing some useful artefacts).
Defense Evasion
Event logs and registry hives show artefacts related to the removal of ESET, the installed AV
product on the server (T1089) before starting the encryption, some duplication of which may
represent automated removal rather than by hand.
The previously mentioned arch.z$ sequence of files in the certutil log represents evidence of
obfuscation of files or information (T1027), which is another technique to avoid detection.
Credential Access
Given the limited telemetry available, no evidence of Credential Access TTPs was observed
(such as accessing system hives, the ntdis.dit file, or the ever-ubiquitous and suspected
mimikatz).
While this was not necessary for the actors to carry out their objectives as referenced in the
Privilege Escalation section, ultimately other accounts were obtained; however their
mechanism for access remains unknown.
Recovered registry hives show the
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest key was set to 1;
although given the age of the machine in question it was possible that the legitimate system
administers never applied the fix to disable this. During the period the intruders were on the
system there appeared to be a legitimate login from the Domain\Administrator account (S-15-21domain-500), which would have given an additional opportunity for the intruders to hijack
these credentials, although this remains an open question.
Discovery
Several network discovery tools were used by the actor (T1018). Famatech’s Advanced Port
Scanner was deployed to the host, with evidence suggesting interaction and use. The
aforementioned PSnmap.psd1 PowerShell datafile (likely an implementation of the well2/5

known nmap) is another network discovery/reconnaissance tool, and 2sys.ps1 script (if the
same as referenced by Carbon Black) contains RDP scanning functionality.
The deployed binary NetworkShare_pre2.exe detected variously as NetTool has a diverse
set of capabilities focused around network discovery. This was not removed from the staging
directory unlike most of the other tooling across this intrusion.
WinPCAP 4.1.3 (rpcapd.exe) was also installed as a service onto the host by the actor, but
its exact purpose cannot be inferred as it may be a dependency of other tooling used.
Lateral Movement
There is evidence from Security Event Logs of the Domain\Administrator account logging
onto other hosts in the environment (via Event ID 4648). The connect-mstsc (ConnectMstsc.ps1) likely provides RDP functionality in PowerShell.
All the other impacted hosts in the environment would not boot, so minimal forensic analysis
was conducted into them as to the actions on them before encrypting. Other reporting details
Medusa Locker spreading via PSexec and SMB - although with Domain Admin access a raft
of lateral movement techniques is available.
Ultimately, the actors were able to spread their payload to effectively every host in the
domain (bar a few off-site laptops).
Collection
There was no firm evidence of collection observed by the actor. Circumstantial evidence
shows interaction with a SQL database present on the system.
Command and Control
As mentioned; the intruders logged in via RDP (External Remote Services - T1133)
from 185.202.1[.]19, 213.7.208[.]69 & 5.2.224[.]56.
Additional information, such as keyboard language or screen size was not available.
Exfiltration
The ransom note referenced potential data exfiltration and release, however no direct
evidence of this was found and no effort was made to reach out and engage with the actor.
Of the limited telemetry observed, there was a spike of 200Gb+ uploaded which did not
match the pattern of life around the incident. If it was carried out, it may have been via
RDPclip (Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel - T1041) which would have left
little evidence.

3/5

The actor has not followed up by engaging with the client. Access to this environment with
Domain Admin would have given them enough access to harvest emails, and contact details
for the business had they wished.
Impact
Given the nature of this intrusion, Data Encrypted For Impact (T1486) was the end goal. This
was incredibly successful in this environment (see: Headline Stats).
The actor created a hidden scheduled task “svhost” (similarly named to the legitimate
svchost process used by windows) and stored the binary in the %AppData%\Roaming\ folder
for the compromised admin user. The binary itself was also named svhost.exe. The binaries
contain a unique key per-campaign, so to preserve the confidentially of the client, this file
won’t be made available in full.
Event logs show its execution every 15 minutes (this behaviour is consistent with other
reported activity on Medusa Locker) as well as failure notices later on.
There remains some ambiguity around the exact timing of their operations. There’s evidence
of the scheduled task running while the operators were still engaged on the host –
unfortunately prefetch data was not available for analysis. Given the cryptographic overhead
involved in sequentially encrypting each file on the file system, they may have been confident
in the knowledge that the system would take some time to become fully degraded. Especially
if the non-system drives were targeted first. There is some evidence (via event logs and
shellbags) of graphical interaction with the Windows task scheduler to manipulate the
scheduled task after it’s deployment – in what looks troubleshooting efforts.
It remains unclear if the operators intended to prevent the other hosts on the network from
booting at all via encrypting the master boot record or if this was unintended - however, the
result was that some of the machines were rendered inoperable - T1487 (Disk Structure
Wipe).
A simple script named _backup.bat was used to delete Volume Shadow Copies – evidence
of Inhibiting System Recovery (T1490) and this was executed on the system before
encryption:

Other examples of MedusaLocker have shown vssadmin.exe to be spawned to further
complicate recovery attempts (T1490):

4/5

The ransom demand pointed to a TOR address with a unique string for this campaign. While
we did not interact with the attackers, others had, which in turn revealed a modestly
successful return, at least for this campaign and further indirect evidence of this adversary
successfully monetising their operation through Data Encrypted For Impact (T1486).
