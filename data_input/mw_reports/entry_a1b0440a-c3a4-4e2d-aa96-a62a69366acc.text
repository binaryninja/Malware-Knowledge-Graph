Access Brokers: Their Targets and Their Worth

Access brokers have become a key component of the eCrime threat landscape, selling
access to threat actors and facilitating myriad criminal activities. Many have established
relationships with big game hunting (BGH) ransomware operators and affiliates of prolific
ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) programs. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team analyzed
the multitude of access brokers’ advertisements posted since 2019 and identified trends in
targeting preferences, as well as insights into the perceived value of different victims.

Top Targets

Access brokers have advertised organizations from more than 30 different sectors,
demonstrating an eclectic range of targets. Among these, the academic, government and
technology sectors were the most frequently advertised, accounting for a combined 49% of
the total advertisements.
The academic sector has historically been a popular focus of ransomware operations, with
intrusions timed to coincide with the start of a new school term to cause the greatest
disruption and in turn encourage a quick ransom payment. Almost 40% of the academic
sector advertisements were for access to U.S.-based institutions, with a spike in activity
noted in August 2021 that coincides with the start of the new semester.
Geographically, advertisements for access to U.S.-based entities far surpass those for all
other countries, claiming 55% of the total. Organizations based in Brazil and the UK secure
second and third spots with 8% and 7%, respectively.
This geographic targeting trend corresponds with other eCrime activity, including data theft
campaigns that frequently result in stolen credentials being traded online in criminal
underground marketplaces. Access brokers are known to purchase such credentials and

abuse them to acquire access.

Controversial Targets
The healthcare sector has been a divisive target among eCrime actors during the past two
years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some adversaries actively avoided operations
against frontline services in particular. Access brokers showed varying interest in targeting
the sector — it sits in joint fourth place alongside financial services for the total number of
identified advertisements, but the timing of the advertisements fluctuated.
Only one advertisement was posted for a healthcare entity in Q1 2020 — coinciding with the
emergence of the pandemic — yet several were posted in Q3 2020 and Q1 2021. The
increase corresponded with news of successful vaccination programs, potentially prompting
increased interest among eCrime adversaries. Law enforcement scrutiny of cybercrime
targeting critical infrastructure, which includes healthcare, also likely impacted supply and
demand for access to this sector.
The energy sector was another controversial target in 2021. The fallout from the Darkside
ransomware incident against Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 had a knock-on effect on access
brokers, as criminal forum moderators imposed restrictions on ransomware-related
discussions. Since ransomware operators account for a high proportion of access brokers’
customer base, the ban likely impacted sales for some brokers. Many switched to private
communication channels, selling only to trusted buyers and hindering efforts to track who
was selling to whom.
Despite the Colonial Pipeline incident prompting these changes, demand for access to the
energy sector never truly waned, though the asking price for access briefly dipped.

What Is Access Worth?
Several factors determine the worth of access, and asking prices vary significantly among
sectors, countries and access brokers. Access with elevated privileges typically attracts a
higher asking price, as does access to large corporations with higher annual revenues or
advertisements by more-established access brokers. Some brokers auction the access,
offering a “buy-it-now” price or attempting to encourage a bidding war.
The sectors attracting the highest average asking price for access were government,
financial services, and industrial and engineering organizations. The most advertised sector
does not necessarily attract the highest asking price; for example, access to the academic
sector was, on average, priced at $3,827 USD. In comparison, the government sector —
which was the second most advertised — attracted an average asking price of $6,151 USD.

Organizations based in the U.S., the UK, and Canada on average attracted higher asking
prices than other countries, reflecting the demand in targeting these locations. It is worth
noting that the advertised price is not necessarily what’s paid, and the majority of access
brokers appear open to negotiation.

5/7

Fluctuations in asking prices are also common and often reactive to the market. CrowdStrike
reported an increase in asking price among access brokers in April 2021, with some
corporate entities attracting five-figure sums, indicating that threat actors likely receive a
significant return on their investment. When the same access is being advertised by two
different access brokers, variations in the asking price are also observed.

Conclusion
The advertisements provide an interesting snapshot of an increasingly lucrative component
of the eCrime ecosystem, where reputation and timing both play important roles. There is
almost certainly an opportunistic element to access broker operations, such as the
availability of exploitable vulnerabilities or the validity of stolen credentials that facilitate
intrusions.
The fallout from the Colonial Pipeline incident and its impact on access brokers’ sales
appears to have been short lived, as in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 CrowdStrike Intelligence has
witnessed a resurgence in advertisements and the emergence of new brokers. Purchasing
access saves time and resources for many eCrime adversaries, and the demand for these is
almost certain to remain high throughout 2022.

Falcon X Recon, CrowdStrike’s digital risk protection solution, goes beyond the dark web to
include forums with restricted access on the deep web, breach data and messaging apps —
all resources commonly used by access brokers to trade or advertise. Falcon X Recon
provides customers with an increased level of situational awareness and helps uncover
potential malicious activity before eCrime adversaries have the chance to exploit it.
The CrowdStrike eCrime Index (ECX) also remains a valuable tool used to identify significant
events that affect the eCrime ecosystem, including fluctuations in the value of accesses.
Monitor the ECX regularly in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to make sure you stay up
to date on these trends.
