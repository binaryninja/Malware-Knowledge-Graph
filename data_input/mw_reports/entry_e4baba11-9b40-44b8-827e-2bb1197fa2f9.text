Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

Overview
The Andariel group is a subgroup of the Lazarus group that has been active since 2015. Andariel has a connection
to the cyber-attack named Operation Black Mine that occurred in 2014 and 2015. However, Operation Black Mine
is also associated with the attacks on the South Korean Military Agency in 2008 and the attacks against South
Korean banks and broadcasters in 2013 (a.k.a DarkSeoul).
The major targets of the Andariel Group include not only military agencies, defense industries, political
organizations, security companies, ICT companies, and energy research institutes, but also financial targets, such
as ATMs, banks, travel agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online gambling users.
Their main methods of attacks are spear phishing using macros, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X
vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks.
The group makes use of well-known backdoors, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, but also uses self-developed
backdoors, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. Furthermore, this group appears to know Korean
language and its IT environment.
This report describes the several cyberattacks by Andariel Threat Group including main methods, and changes in
their purpose and targets.

Attack Vectors (Infection Routes)
The Andariel group uses a variety of attack techniques, and, in particular, they take advantage of vulnerabilities of
local software in South Korea.

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

1. Spear Phishing
The Andariel group uses the spear phishing method by understanding their target and sending emails with an
attachment that appears to be from a relevant, seemingly trustworthy source. The attachments contain macro
and trick the targeted recipient into activating the macro. However, this method of inducing macro activation has
become more devious after 2015.
[Figure 2] below shows the contents of attachments used in the 2015 attacks with the original method of inducing
macro activation. The user can enable macro, but there is not a significant need to do so because the content is
visible.

[Figure 2] Contents of documents used in the 2015 attack

However, malicious attachments found since 2017 show a new method. The contents of documents are blurred,
as shown in [Figure 3], as if there is a problem with the display, increasing the likelihood of the recipients enabling
the macros.

2. Watering Hole (Active-X Vulnerability)
The Andariel group also uses the watering hole technique, which compromise and inject exploit codes into a
website. The targeted systems are infected with malware upon accessing the compromised website using a
vulnerable web browser. These attacks also limit infection to specific IP address ranges, making it much more
difficult to identify the attack targets.
For the watering hole attack, the group usually embeds an Active-X vulnerability exploit codes in the target website.
When the target accesses the website via an Internet Explorer browser with a specific Active-X installed the attack
proceeds. After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, a JavaScript or VBScript file is created on the user
system and this file downloads the malware from a specified address.

[Figure 4] Script file created in the infected system

Here, the "MZ" ASCII string, which represents a Windows executable file, does not exist within the file. The
malware adds this text string starting with MZ from the local system to create an executable file. This method
seems to be used to avoid detection by behavior-based security solutions when the executable file is downloaded.

3. Central Management Solution
Institutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by
connecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for
Network Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch
management, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software
distribution, and remote control.
The attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company
to find and exploit the vulnerability. The attacks on the central management software can be categorized into two
types: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client.

[Figure 6] Concept diagram of the central management solution
Most central management solutions consist of a management server and a client on which the agent is
installed. The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and
remotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server.
In the event of an attack using the management server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and
distributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of
administrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial
software from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However,
if a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be
distributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server.
The client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted
from the management server. Generally, the agent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file
is verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to
the agent.

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

The Andariel group is responsible for carrying out many attacks on central management solutions that are widely
used in South Korea. The following are the cases of the group transferring malicious files exploiting the
vulnerabilities of the client agent in three types of central management solution.
The first case is malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution A, which was first discovered
in 2015. When the malware is executed, the executable file, v3pscan.exe, containing malware is transmitted to the
agent of central management solution A through a specified IP address and executed.

[Figure 7] Remote execution command used in the attack on the central management solution A

Attacks on the central management solution B were made between 2015 and 2017. Various types of malware
were used, such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe, to exploit the management system. Also, the
attacker used a method of generating a VBScript file, such as vs1.vbs and winrm.vbs, to download malicious files.
Variants of this malware were discovered between 2015 and 2017, which used the server IP, target system IP,
download address, remote executable path, and other items as arguments to exploit systems and generate
script files that downloaded malware. The generated script downloads a file from the address entered as an
argument and restores 5 bytes.

[Figure 8] Attack tool used in the attack on the central management solution B

The malware that exploited the vulnerabilities in central management solution C was first found in September
2016. This attack performs malicious transferring and executing of files.

4. Supply Chain Attack
The Andariel group is also known for their attacks on supply chain vulnerabilities. The primary attack method
includes incorporating the malware in the software installer edition to infect the target via distribution from the
official website and software updates. However, in some cases, the attack was not designed to infect all software
users but only the specified target IP address. The group also used the supply chain attack to exploit vulnerabilities
of software used in specific industries.

Attack Cases
The initial targets of the Andariel group were military agencies and the defense industry in South Korea.
In 2015, there was an attack on exhibitors in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX). ADEX
is an international defense industry exhibition that has been hosted bi-annually since 1996. The attacker sent an
email with an Excel or Word document containing macros, pretending to be the organizer of the event. The
attached document was disguised as a legitimate content, and malware was downloaded when the recipient
opened the file and clicked "Use Content" to activate the macro. The downloaded file was a Rifdoor variant.
From the document file found later, it seems that the attack group focused on its attacks mainly on the defense
industry. [Table 1] below summarizes significant attacks made by the Andariel group.

[Table 1] Major attacks of the Andariel group

In February 2016, a Korean security company was hacked, and an electronic certificate was leaked. Recently in
August 2018, an additional malware was discovered to be distributed as a legitimate DRM program.
In April 2016, defense industry, marine service providers, and ICT companies were infected with Gh0st RAT, a
malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution B. In June 2016, the Korean police
agency unveiled operation Gh0st RAT, a large-scale hacking incident on mega companies in the defense
industry that exploited the vulnerabilities in centralized management solutions. Gh0st RAT is a malware that
attempts to infect the target through the file distribution function using the vulnerabilities of central
management solution A, and about 40,000 documents were leaked by the Gh0st RAT malware.

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

Ever since August 2016, the Andariel group has exploited the vulnerabilities in anti-virus management programs
to attack military agencies and leak information. From the end of 2016, the purpose of the attack changed from
information leakage to monetary gain. In October 2016, the attacker hacked the website of a software provider
and replaced the installation file with a file containing malware to release malicious codes that served as cheats in
online gambling games. In 2017, to maximize the chances of a successful attack, malware was distributed to
multiple computers using an internet cafe management program.
In March 2017, a case was discovered where credit card information was leaked due to the hacking of an ATM
in Korea. It seems attempts were made from November 2016, and the malware used in the attack was similar
to those used in the leaking of a military agency’s data in 2016.
From May to July 2017, there were concentrated attacks on the financial industry. The malware was
distributed through the website of monetary unions, and the attacks attempted to exploit the vulnerability
of their systems.

In October 2017, the largest travel agency in Korea was hacked, resulting in the leakage of personal
information. Moreover, travel agency was hacked in December of the same year. In December 2017, the
Andariel group modified the ERP solution update file of a company A and added malware to the file. At that
time, malware was downloaded only to attack a specific target company, and not all companies using the ERP
solution.
In December 2017, the Andariel group launched attacks on virtual currency exchange users. In January 2018,
it distributed a remote support program containing malware. In February 2018, the group employed various
types of attacks, including the email attack where it impersonated the office of a National Assembly member.
Malware used in the email attack was a variant of the malware used in the ATM hacking in 2017, and another
variant was used in the attacks on the financial industry in June.

Malware and Attack Tools
1. Malware – Backdoor
The Andariel group uses in-house advanced malware, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Phandoor, and Rifdoor, as well
as other well-known malware, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT.

1.1) Aryan
Aryan was detected in 2015 and is characterized by the string "F**k Hack Hound."

[Figure 10] Strings in Aryan

1.2) Gh0st RAT
Gh0st RAT is a backdoor made in China, and its source codes are publicly available. The Andariel group used this
malware for attacks from 2015 to 2016. It created and used a Korean version in some cases. Packagers, such as
Themida packaged some variants.

[Figure 11] Strings in Gh0st RAT

[Figure 12] shows the Chinese attack tools converted into Korean and used by the Andariel group.

[Figure 12] Chinese (back) and Korean (front) controllers

1.3) Rifdoor
Rifdoor was first discovered in November 2015, and it remained active until early 2016. A Rifdoor variant was
used to attack SEOUL ADEX exhibitors in 2015 and was found in the hacking incidents of security companies
in early 2016.
Rifdoor is characterized by the string included in the PDB information: E:\Data\My Projects\Troy Source
Code\tcp1st\rifle\Release\rifle.pdb.

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

[Figure 13] PDB Information of Rifdoor

When it enters the system, Rifdoor generates a file by adding garbage data to the 4 bytes of the last part of the file.
Therefore, since the hash value changes each time the system is infected, the malware cannot be found in the
system with a simple hash value.

[Figure 14] Comparison of original and generated files
[Table 2] shows the major commands associated with Rifdoor and their respective functions.
Command
$interval
$downloadexec
$download

E:\Data\My Projects\Troy Source Code\tcp1st\rifle\Release\rifle.pdb
E:\Data\My Projects\Troy Source Code\tcp1st\server\Release\server.pdb

[Table 3] PDB Information of the Rifdoor variant

1.4) Phandoor
Phandoor was used from January 2016 to the summer of 2017. It is characterized by having the string "S^%" before
the main character strings. (E.g. S^%s\cmd.exe, S^nehomegpa.dll) However, some variants found in 2017 did not
contain its character string, "Anonymous?"

[Figure 15] Strings in Phandoor

When Phandoor is executed, it initializes and tries to connect to C&C server. At this time, the string "Anonymous?"
is sent to check whether that the server is functioning properly.

1.5) Andaratm
Andaratm malware was used in attacks on military agencies in 2016, on ATMs and financial institutions in 2017,
and on cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018. 18 variants have been identified as of May 2018.
The codes of Andaratm include strings such as "%s\cmd.exe /c echo | %s > %s" and "%s*****%s."

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

[Figure 17] T Strings of Andaratm
When Andaratm is executed, it acquires information, such as the computer name and username, attempts to
connect to the designated C2 server, and receives and executes the command.
The encryption method of Andaratm is similar to the methods generally used by malware.

[Figure 18] Encryption method of Andaratm
Andaratm only executes simple commands, such as downloading files, uploading files, and running cmd.exe files.

2. Attack Tools
The attacker uses various tools, such as Putty Link and port scanner, which are used for communication.

[Figure 19] Port scanner
A tool was also used to check the IP and port with file names like pcon.exe, portc.exe, and zcon.exe. A variant of
Zcon.exe was also used in Bmdoor in 2015.

14

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

[Figure 20] Zcon.exe

The Andariel group produced malware named Crash.exe and Test.exe; these malware destroy hard disk contents
after August of each year. It is not confirmed, however, whether these malware were used in actual attacks.

Similarities in Multiple Attack Cases
The Andariel group has launched many attacks using a variety of malware. In addition to the similarity of their
codes, factors are indicating the association between these attacks. Results from the detailed analysis of AhnLab
shows that the Andariel group and Operation Black Mine take the similar attack methods, and in particular, they
both used the file, zcon.exe. This suggests that Operation Black Mine is associated with the Andariel group. The
similar malware was used to attack various targets, and some of them used the same C2.

Analysis Report_Andariel Threat Group

Conclusion
The Andariel Group is one of the most active threat groups in South Korea. In the early days, most attacks were
designed to steal military information. Since the end of 2016, however, attacks have also been made for monetary
gain. In addition, based on their frequent attacks using vulnerabilities of software used by the target, it can be seen
that the group is well aware of Korea IT environment.
As evident in the attack cases of the group, central management solutions of companies and institutions can
become a route of an attack at any time. Attacks exploiting a central management solution may cause enormous
damage throughout the organization. Thus, more strengthened security management is required.
In particular, a security policy for the management server of a central management solution is critical. Suitable
management is required to ensure that necessary security policies are observed, such as frequently changing
administrator’s login password of the management server and not saving it in the system, as well as limiting the
access to the management server. In addition, logs must be checked periodically to make sure that abnormal files
have not been distributed via the management server. There was a case where the attacker exploited the
vulnerability in an agent installed in the client without going through the management server, so it is necessary to
monitor whether or not scanning of the port number used by the central management solution occurs.
Attackers use a variety of methods in their attempts to infiltrate companies and institutions. Most organizations
focus on strengthening security on endpoints, but it is just as much essential to monitor events that occur in the
internal infrastructure, just like the central management solution.
