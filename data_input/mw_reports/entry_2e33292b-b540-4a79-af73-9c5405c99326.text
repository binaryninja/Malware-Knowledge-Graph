Executive Summary
"Fxmsp" is a high-profile Russian- and English-speaking hacking collective. They
specialize in breaching highly secure protected networks to access private corporate
and government information.

1/5

They have a long-standing reputation for selling sensitive information from high-profile
global government and corporate entities.
In March 2019, Fxmsp stated they could provide exclusive information stolen from
three top anti-virus companies located in the United States. They confirmed that they
have exclusive source code related to the companies' software development. They are
offering to sell it, and network access, for over $300,000 USD.
AdvIntel subject matter experts assess with high confidence that Fxmsp is a credible
hacking collective with a history of selling verifiable corporate breaches returning them
profit close to $1,000,000 USD. AdvIntel alerted law enforcement regarding these
claimed intrusions.
Background
Fxmsp is a hacking collective that has operated in various top-tier Russian- and Englishspeaking underground communities since 2017. They are known for targeting corporate and
government networks worldwide.

Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)
Throughout 2017 and 2018, Fxmsp established a network of trusted proxy resellers to
promote their breaches on the criminal underground. Some of the known Fxmsp TTPs
included accessing network environments via externally available remote desktop protocol
(RDP) servers and exposed active directory.

Most recently, the actor claimed to have developed a credential-stealing botnet capable of
infecting high-profile targets in order to exfiltrate sensitive usernames and passwords. Fxmsp
has claimed that developing this botnet and improving its capabilities for stealing information
from secured systems is their main goal.

Fxmsp: Three Major Antivirus Company Breaches
On April 24, 2019, Fxmsp claimed to have secured access to three leading antivirus
companies. According to the hacking collective, they worked tirelessly for the first quarter of
2019 to breach these companies and finally succeeded and obtained access to the
companies’ internal networks.

The collective extracted sensitive source code from antivirus software, AI, and security
plugins belonging to the three companies. Fxmsp also commented on the capabilities of the
different companies’ software and assessed their efficiency.

The collective provided a list of specific indicators through which it is possible to identify the
company even when a seller is not disclosing its name. Fxmsp offered screenshots of folders
purported to contain 30 terabytes of data, which they allegedly extracted from these
4/5

networks. The folders seem to contain information about the company’s development
documentation, artificial intelligence model, web security software, and antivirus software
base code.

Motivation Behind Antivirus Company Breaches
Targeting antivirus companies appears to have been the primary goal of Fxmps' latest
network intrusions. The actor claimed that antivirus breach research has been their main
project over the last six months, which directly correlates with the six-month period during
which they were silent on the underground forums where they normally post. This period
started with their seeming disappearance in October 2018 and concluded with their return in
April 2019.

Attribution Claims Behind Fxmsp Moniker
According to “ShadowRunTeam,” a high-profile Russian threat actor operating on Telegram,
Fxmsp is reportedly a Moscow resident with the first name "Andrey" who started to engage in
cybercrime activities in mid-2000 and specialized in social engineering.

Our subject matter experts assess with high confidence that Fxmsp is a credible hacking
collective that has a history of selling verifiable corporate breaches returning them profit
close to $1,000,000 USD. AdvIntel alerted US law enforcement regarding the purported
intrusions.

Recommendations & Possible Mitigation
Monitoring and reviewing the network perimeter for any externally-exposed Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers and Active Directory (AD) might reduce exposure to
the known two initial attack vectors.
Employing robust patching and security hygiene, as well as monitoring for
spearphishing email messages might assist with identifying early warnings linked to the
Fxmsp's newer attack vector environment.
Segregating and protecting sensitive source code development environments from
access to the main network might thwart attempts to exfiltrate intellectual property from
the network.
