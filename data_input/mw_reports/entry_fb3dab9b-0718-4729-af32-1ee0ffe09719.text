Introduction
On August 2020 a new type of malware, belonging to the Ransomware category, appeared
in the cyber threat landscape. Threat actor responsible for its development called it
“DarkSide” and, like others piece of malware of this type, is operated in Big Game Hunting
(BGH) campaigns. Around more or less the same time, a DLS (Dedicated Leak Site) was
made available on the darkweb (behind the TOR network) in order to report the first victims.
On their DLS DarkSide operators claimed to be experienced in conducting cyber
operations, having previously used other, not better identified, ransomware variants. Indeed,
some characteristics of their first operations support the hypothesis that the group could be a
former affiliate of some other R-a-a-S (Ransomware as a Service) program that chosen to
write their own ransomware likely to avoid sharing the profits of criminal activities with third
parties.

Insights

1/11

DarkSide is a well-written malware family not much changed over the time if compared to
the first versions analyzed on August / September 2020. Usually, the samples belonging to
this family present some features aimed at making the analysis more harder. For example,
in a recent sample (sha256:
17139a10fd226d01738fe9323918614aa913b2a50e1a516e95cced93fa151c61), at 0040182A
we find a sub aimed at dynamically resolving DLLs and API through LoadLibrary /
GetProcAddress. sub_4016D5, sub_4013DA and sub_401AC3 are also involved in this
process. The following screenshot shows a chunk of code extracted from the whole function
designed for this purpose:

This can be a useful place to create a code based Yara rule aimed at potentially hunting
further variants of the same malware family. After having selected several representative
chunks we can obtain something similar to the following:
rule DarkSide_Ransomware_827333_39928 : CRIMEWARE {
meta:
author = “Emanuele De Lucia”
description = “Detects possible variants of DarkSide ransomware”
hash1 = “17139a10fd226d01738fe9323918614aa913b2a50e1a516e95cced93fa151c61”

*/
strings:
$ = { E8 [4] 56 E8 [4] 8B D8 FF 76 ?? 56 E8 [4] 8B 46 ?? 8D 34 06 B9 ?? ?? ?? ?? }
condition:
any of them
}

Darkside employs also techniques for privilege escalation and UAC (User Access Control)
bypass. The technique observed in this case is known as CMSTPLUA UAC Bypass and
exploits the ShellExec function by CMSTPLUA COM interface {3E5FC7F9-9A51-43679063-A120244FBEC7}. This allow to start a process with elevated permissions, according to
the following graph:

Powershell is used in order to delete shadow copies preventing the recovery of previously
backed up files through them according to the following syntax:
powershell -ep bypass -c
“(0..61)|%{$s+=[char][byte]
(‘0x’+’4765742D576D694F626A6563742057696E33325F536861646F77

.Substring(2*$_,2))};iex $s”
Decoded:
Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}

A quick Sigma rule can be employed in order to hunt for similar systems-side behaviors.

Before executing the main payload, the sample performs several other activities like
information gathering (f.e. get Disks Info)

and a comparison of system services with a predefined list to stop those ones that could
affect the files encryption process

After the encryption phase, Darkside is designed to communicate to its command and
control server in order to share details relating to the victim (victimID) as well as further
parameters useful for recovering encrypted files and identifying the affiliate.
Most probably these network capabilities have been added in order to support the R-a-a-S
model. In the analyzed sample, the CnC (Command and Control) is attested over the domain
name securebestapp20.com. Detecting network activities potentially related to this threat
6/11

could therefore involve writing SNORT rules similar to the following:
alert udp $HOME_NET any -> any 53 (msg:”DNS request for blacklisted domain
‘securebestapp20.com'”; content:”|0f|securebestapp20|03|com|00|”;nocase;
reference:url,https://www.emanueledelucia.net/; sid:[SID HERE]; rev:1;)
This domain name has been created on 16/09/2020 and, according to my visibility, at the
time of writing it has a history of two (2) A record associated. The interesting one is linked to
the IP 185.105.109.19. Could be interested to note that the pDNS count value for this
domain name from 21/09/2020 (day of first observed resolution to 185.105.109.19) to
05/01/2021 (day of last observed resolution to 185.105.109.19) is less than 180 and that
most of them occurred from early November until today. This suggests a growth of the
spread and obviously of the R-a-a-S business as well. In general, moreover, this number is
also consistent with the low overall volume of DarkSide campaigns observed at least until
mid-November 2020. This is further confirmed by the payload-side global visibility I can
dispose of for this malware family.
Following are shown detection hits for DarkSide malfamily until the end of the year where it’s
possible to observe a general increase in the detection rates towards December 2020.

Welcome to Darkside
On 11/10/2020 a user posted an announcement titled “[Affiliate Program] Darkside
Ransomware” on a Russian-speaking darkweb forum. The text contained in that post
officially started the project’s affiliate program. Press articles has been used in order to
advertise the program itself as well as the skills of the group that are “aimed only at large
corporations” as originally posted by threat actor itself:

7/11

In the affiliate program are not welcome, among others, English speaking personalities,
employees of the secret service, security researchers, the greedy (at least so I seem to
understand) etc.etc.

There are, moreover, some rules to be respected, like avoiding to target entities within
countries belonging to the CIS (Содружество Независимых Государств), including
Georgia and Ukraine, or those operating in education, medicine, public and non-profit sector.
As you might imagine for any other job, there is a selection to go through in order to be
included in the program. This includes an interview to check the candidate’s skills and
experiences, such having been affiliated with some other program previously. The group
offers a Windows and Linux version of DarkSide ransomware plus an admin panel, a leak
site, and a CDN system for data storage.

So, do you have ESXi?
At the end of November 2020, a Linux variant of DarkSide ransomware was uploaded to a
well-known online malware repository. It had a detection rate, at the time of upload,
practically non-existent. Even at time of writing (Jan 2021) the detection rate is very low
(2/63). It seems to have a quite different purpose respect to the Windows counterpart. While
the latter is born to encrypt all user files on a workstation (documents, images, PDFs and so
on…), the Linux version has been created to damage virtual machines on servers. Indeed,
the samples looks for extensions related to VMWare files like .vmdk, .vmem, .vswp and
generic logs formats.

The ransom note is similar to the Windows one

and the output of the executable, once launched, confirms the focus on ESXi environments

9/11

as /vmfs/volumes/ is the default location of ESXi virtual machines. A strict Yara rule similar
to the following can help in identifying Linux variants of DarkSide:
rule DarkSide_Ransomware_827333_39930 : CRIMEWARE {
meta:
author = “Emanuele De Lucia”
description = “Detects possible variants of Linux DarkSide ransomware variants”
hash1 = “da3bb9669fb983ad8d2ffc01aab9d56198bd9cedf2cc4387f19f4604a070a9b5”
strings:
$ = “vmdk,vmem,vswp,log” fullword ascii
$ = “XChaCha20” fullword ascii
$ = “Partial File Encryption Tool” fullword ascii
$ = “main.log” fullword ascii
condition:
(uint16(0) == 0x457f and all of them)
}
Also for the Linux version, communications to the outside world take place through the same
domain name previously reported and a specially crafted URL for each victim. Through
Sigma it’s possible to write rules aimed at detecting DNS resolution requests to domain name
where actually the command and control is attested:

Adversary Profile
From mid-November 2020, following the affiliation program, it’s currently more difficult to
associate the exclusive use of DarkSide ransomware to a specific threat actor.
However, some similarities with Revil suggest that its developer may be familiar with this
solution until speculating that it may be from a former Revil affiliate who, to have more control
over the operations and not to divide the profits, launched his own project, further enhanced
by an independent affiliate program. Regardless the specific actor behind the operations,
DarkSide can be delivered via several vectors usually after gathering information about the
target.
According to my visibility, at least one threat actor who used DarkSide adopted the phishing
technique (T1566) in order to deliver a first-stage payload whose exploitation finally allowed
the distribution of DarkSide variants within the victim environment. Other intrusion techniques
involve exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed applications (T1190) in order to get a first
foothold from which to perform lateral movements.
