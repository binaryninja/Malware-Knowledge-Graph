A few weeks ago, we observed a spear phishing campaign targeting groups in the
aerospace and defense industry. We identified at least 12 different organizations targeted
in this attack. These organizations include aviation, air traffic control, and government and
defense contractors.

Figure 1. Spear phishing email targeting aerospace and defense industry

In choosing their targets, the attackers identified individuals in important roles, including
directors and vice presidents. The content of all the emails were identical. The attackers
used a report published in 2012 regarding the outlook of the aerospace and defense
industries as the lure. The intention of the attackers was to make it seem as though this
email originally came from the company that authored the report. The emails were also
crafted to look as though they were being forwarded by internal employees or by
individuals from within the industries identified.

When the malicious PDF attached to the email is opened, it attempts to exploit the Adobe
Flash Player CVE-2011-0611 'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE2011-0611). If successful, it drops malicious files as well as a clean PDF file to keep the
ruse going.

The clean PDF file that is dropped is the industry report identified as the lure, however, it
curiously has been modified by the attackers to remove some branding elements.
In addition to the clean PDF file, the threat drops a malicious version of the svchost.exe
file. This file then drops a malicious version of ntshrui.dll into the Windows directory. The
threat leverages a technique known as DLL search order hijacking (the ntshrui.dll file is not
protected by KnownDLLs). When the svchost.exe file calls the explorer.exe file, it will load
the malicious ntshrui.dll file in the Windows folder instead of the legitimate ntshrui.dll file in
the Windows system directory. Symantec detects both the svchost.exe and ntshrui.dll files
as Backdoor.Barkiofork.
This version of Backdoor.Barikiofork has the following capabilities:
Enumerates disk drives
Contacts the command-and-control (C&C) server at osamu.update.ikwb.com
Steals system information
Downloads and executes further updates
This spear phishing campaign continues to show the sophistication and preparation of
attackers, especially gathering intelligence on what social engineering will best entice
targets.
Organizations should ensure proper email security is in place and also make patch
management a priority, as the vulnerability exploited here was patched in 2011.
