A new ransomware is taking the unusual approach of selling its decryptor on the Roblox
gaming platform using the service's in-game Robux currency.
Roblox is an online kids gaming platform where members can create their own games and
monetize them by selling Game Passes, which provide in-game items, special access, or
enhanced features.
To pay for these Game Passes, members must purchase them using an in-game currency
called Robux.

Today, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam found a new ransomware named
'WannaFriendMe' that impersonates the notorious Ryuk Ransomware. However, in reality, it
is a variant of the Chaos Ransomware.
In June 2021, a threat actor began selling a Chaos ransomware builder that allowed
wannabe criminals to create their very own ransomware infection with customized ransom
notes, encrypted file extensions, and other features.
By default, the Chaos builder pretends to be Ryuk, using the .ryuk extension for encrypted
files, as shown below.

What makes the new WannaFriendMe ransomware stand out is that instead of demanding
cryptocurrency as a ransom payment, it requires victims to purchase a decryptor from
Roblox's Game Pass store using Robux, as can be read in the ransom note below:

----- YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED! ----Don't panic, your files are decryptable, But your files can only be decrypted with our
own decrypter tool! To get this decrypter, you must buy this gamepass:
https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/49955147/Ryuk-Decrypter
YOU MUST HAVE A ROBLOX ACCOUNT TO BUY THE GAMEPASS, BUY 1700
ROBUX AND THEN BUY THE GAMEPASS ABOVE.
AFTER BUYING THE GAMEPASS, CONTACT xxx@icloud.com WITH YOUR
USERNAME AND SCREENSHOT OF YOU OWNING THE GAMEPASS. DO NOT
DELETE THE GAMEPASS OTHERWISE YOU WILL DISOWN THE GAMEPASS.
When visiting the URL to the Roblox Game Pass store, you can see that the 'Ryuk
Decrypter' is being sold by a user named 'iRazormind' for 1,499 Robux and was last updated
on June 5th.

The problem with Chaos ransomware variants is that they not only encrypt your data but also
destroy it in many cases.
While encrypting a device, any file greater than 2MB in size will be overwritten with random
data and not encrypted. This means that even if you purchase a decryptor, only files smaller
than 2MB can be recovered.

While it is unclear how this ransomware is distributed or if it has been used in attacks, its
destructive nature and its targeting of young gamers could lead to significant damage.
This is not the first time Chaos ransomware variants have targeted gamers.
In October, threat actors targeted Japanese Minecraft players with 'alt lists' allegedly
containing stolen Minecraft accounts but encrypted devices with the Chaos ransomware
variant instead.
