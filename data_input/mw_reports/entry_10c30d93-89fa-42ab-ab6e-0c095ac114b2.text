INTRODUCTION

Main Discovery
On February 25th, 2016, the Lazarus Group and its APT attacks were analyzed and released to the
public by the industry alliance led by Novetta1 which is composed of Kaspersky Labs2, Alien Vault
Labs3and other security companies. Coincidentally, the Group is also the organization behind
DarkSeoul Operation4 targeting Korean financial institutions and media houses in 2013 and the
cyber-attack targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)5 in 2014. This group mainly targets
some Asian countries like Korea and the victim industries include government, entertainment &
media houses, army, aeronautical & astronautical institutes, financial entities and instruction
industries, etc.

In the year of 2015, we also detected an APT organization targeting government entities,
transportation companies and energy industries. Through our further investigations, it hasn’t
been found to be connected with the Lazars Group for the time being. Due to the fact that the
Trojans dropped by this organization uses Onion.City6 as their C&C and that their malware
document names all contain dog.jpg, this organization’s APT attacks which stretched from 2013
to 2015 is code-named as Operation OnionDog. The initial malicious code dated back in May,
2011, followed by at least three concentrated attacks which happened in 2013, July-August in
2014 and July - September in 2015, respectively. Afterwards, we identified 96 pieces of malware
along with 14 C&C domains and IP addresses.

The malware of OnionDog spread itself by taking full advantage of the vulnerability in Hangul popular office software in Korean speaking countries; in the meanwhile, it infected targets
through USB Worms inside an isolated network. What also caught our attention is that members
of this organization communicated via Onion.City so that they could visit domains in the Deep
Web without the help of Tor browser. This has created an ideal invisible cloak for the hackers in
the anonymous environment of Tor. In addition, our in-depth analysis prevails that this threat
actor tried to fly false flags or mislead investigators by adopting the techniques and resources of
other APT organizations that are already revealed to the world.

Chapter 2

Persistent Cyber-espionage

1. Initial attacks
Seeing from the current data we collected, malicious program spread itself mainly by either
taking advantage of the vulnerability of HWP documents or pretending to be HWP documents.
Attacks in this kind of guise usually are carried out via spearfishing emails.

Hangul is prevalent local office software in South Korea with the file format of HWP (Hangul
Word Processor)7. The fact that the threat actor is using HWP documents as a shield as well as
adopting HWP exploit file suggests that the targeted users must be using or at least be familiar
with Hangul.

2. Attack procedures

Picture 6 Attack procedures
Once the Trojan (whether guise or exploit) is installed successfully, it will check if the installation
time is within the specific attacking time (please refer to the attacking time in the table below). If
the attacking time is over, it will stop the task and delete itself; otherwise, it will send requests to
Control and Command (C&C) servers. The communication method evolves over time, for example,

the malicious program in 2014 requested the same IP and then it downloaded other Trojans
though HTTP while in the 2015 malware version, all the C&C domains are consolidated into one “Onion.City”. More details about it will be introduced in the chapter of “Command and Control
Mechanisms”.

Among all the downloaded Trojans through HTTP, USB Worm is one of them. The Worm will
infect any USB that is connected to the infected device. Then it will pass back data including the
current time, the name of the computer, MAC address, the status of the infection
(successful/failed), etc. to its C&C server.

In addition, besides the above procedures, once the HWP exploit is successfully triggered, it will
also release a backdoor.

Dropper
The types of droppers are different depending on whether to use a guise Trojan or to drop an
HWP exploit file. Furthermore, based on the difference of C&C addresses, the Trojan have some
variations, namely Trojans with fixed IP, Onion.City Trojan and test Trojan which have very little in
common on the code architecture. To be more specific, the 2014 version malware sent request to
a fixed IP, but in the 2015 malware, the C&C domain was changed a consolidated one called
Onion.City. Another kind of Trojan was also detected in those two years. We captured malware
samples that didn’t have C&C addresses with only downloaded pictures simply named “hello” or
have the same IP “127.0.0.1”. Therefore we inferred they are the test Trojans.

As we mentioned, when the dropper is installed successfully and the date matches the attacking
time, the dropper will send request to its C&C address to download other Trojans. The
downloaded Trojans are saved in the file directory %temp% following the filename pattern of
“XXX_YYY.jpg”. Together with the discoveries on lure documents, we figured out that these file
names has special meanings - usually referring to a specific industry. The correspondences are as
below:

that

the

of

concentrated their forces on Korean Speaking countries’ instruction industry with diplomatic
selection. In 2015, hackers cyber-attacked some transportation organizations including but not
limited to ports, VTS, subway corporation, bus company, etc., while back in 2014, the attacks
were focused on energy industry when several electric companies and water companies became
the victims.

USB Worms
USB Worm is one of the Trojans downloaded. It affects any USB that is connected to the infected
device and then passes back the required information to the C&C server.

The detailed execution flow can be found in the picture below. If it successfully connects to the
Internet, it will send information to a specific server
(hXXp://strj3ya55r367jqd.onion.city/main.php, port 80). The delivered information includes the
current time, computer name, IP, MAC address, drive, the special string’ USB 감염성공’ and
‘USB 감염실패’ (meaning the infection is success or failed). If there are logs about USB, it will
create a file named as ‘drive\deviceId’ to record the user’s actions and send files to the specific
sever.

ICEFOG Backdoor
Regarding the connection between the backdoor and Operation OnionDog, please see Chapter 5
ICEFOG “Rebirth”: aiming at misleading or false flagging? To know more about the functionality
of the backdoor, please see the published research from Kaspersky Lab8.

Picture 10 Attack timeline

Except for the backdoor, if other malicious Trojans want to execute all the functionalities, they
will need to check whether the time on the host computer is within the effective time of the
attack. Judging from the time slot between malware compile dates and ending dates, we
concluded that the average survival time of the OnionDog Trojans should be 15 days. Picture 10

The Icefog APT: A Tale of Cloak and Three
Daggers,https://securelist.com/blog/research/57331/the-icefog-apt-a-tale-of-cloak-and-three-daggers/

shows the attack timeline over the past few years. From 2013, the OnionDog gang carried out
attacks on yearly basis and each session lasted very short time. Curiously, the ending time of the
criminal campaigns are very similar, for instance, four campaigns in 2015 ended on August 8th
with one day earlier than two campaigns in 2014.

Vulnerability Analysis

1. Introduction
Through our in-depth analysis, we are sure that the vulnerability of HWP is not a zero-day one
but an already revealed one that was unveiled in the APT report from nProtect9 back in 2011.

When Hangul Word Processor (HWP) reads documents in HWP 2.0, it uses function strcpy to
process the front name and has no limits on the length of bits which results in buffer overflow
and covers the SEH records. After triggering the memory access exception, the actors executed
malicious codes by running the shellcode in Next SEH Record with the instruction sequence of
‘pop/pop/ret’.

The vulnerability exists in HWP 2010 and some earlier versions. Please see the details below:
Affected versions
HWP 2002 5.7.9.3047 and earlier version
HWP 2004 6.0.5.764 and earlier version
HWP 2005 6.7.10.1053 and earlier version
HWP 2007 7.5.12.604 and earlier version
HWP 2010 8.0.3.726 and earlier version
Unaffected versions
HWP 2002 5.7.9.3049 and later versions
HWP 2004 6.0.5.765 and later versions
HWP 2005 6.7.10.1055 and later versions
HWP 2007 7.5.12.614 and later versions

Table 6 List of malicious HWP document

2. Exploit mechanism
HWP supports documents in formats of .hwp, .doc, .wps, .ppt and so on. .hwp format includes
HWP 2.0, HWP 3.0 and HWP 5.0. HWP 2.0 is a very old version, so when HWP process HWP 2.0
documents, it will switch the format to HWP 3.0 automatically.

Picture 12 File format of HWP vulnerable documents

The offset of the font structure in HWP 2.0 is 0x48E. The first two bytes in the font structure are
the number of font names. Each font name has the length of 0x28. When HWP is processing a
HWP 2.0 document, function ConvertFilterFileToWorkFile in Class CHwp20ToHwp30FilterLibrary
will be called to convert the document into an HWP 3.0 document. Function Set20FontList will be
called to process font structure.

Picture 13 Function Set20FontList

Function Set20FontList will read 28 bytes from the HWP 2.0 document into the array arySrc[0x28],
then loop copy bytes into aryDest[0x28] until the byte equals zero. But in the computer memory,
arySrc is followed by aryDest. So the attacker took advantage of it. In the process, when the last
byte of arySrc is 0x3C instead of zero, the loop will not stop and continue to copy the bytes in
aryDest until it triggered the access exception C0000005.

While copying the 00130000, it will trigger the access exception C0000005, then it will jump to
the Windows exception handling process and call SEH Handler(7FFAC1B1) with the second
parameter pointing to 12E4B8.

Picture 16 Call SEH Handler

Picture 17 pop pop ret instruction sequence

This is the instruction sequence ‘pop/pop/ret in’ ntdll.7FFAC1B1. After executing the two ‘pop’,
ESP pointing to 12E4B8 where the initial position of malicious shellcode is that will be executed
after the ‘Retn’ instruction.

Picture 18 The execution of shellcode

In the end, it will create a normal HWP document in temp path and launch hwp.exe in HWP 2007
path, then load the document tmp.hwp and release the malicious msserver.exe. The interesting
thing is that ICEFOG malware is not even released.

Chapter 4

Command and Control
Mechanisms

We differentiate the versions of OnionDog by the communication methods in the operations.
Through the sample analysis, we found that there are two main types of communication
methods: one is based on fixed IP (operation in 2014) and the other one is based on Onion.City
(operation in 2015). This map points out the correspondence between OnionDog samples and
their C&C.

Picture 19 Correspondence between samples malware and their C&C

hXXp://j2kiphmeb4m4ek66.onion.city/index2.php
hXXp://bcn5w6eqglytlnnn.onion.city/index2.php
Table 7 Related Onion.City URLs

In 2015, the communication method within the OnionDog gang has been fully upgraded to
Onion.City which is a much more high-end and covert communication method compared to the
existing APT attacks. The role of URLs related to “index2.php” is to download other malicious
codes while the URLs related to “main.php” are used to steal data from the pass-back process.

Onion.City is the communication method where web search engine adopts Tor2web proxy
technology so that users can visit domains in the Deep Web without the help of Tor browser. This
has created an ideal invisible cloak for the attackers in the anonymous environment of Tor.

2. Fixed IP
The communication C&C in the malicious Trojans in 2014 and 2015 are all directly connected to a
fixed IP which has been hard-coded in the malicious codes. Coincidentally, the geo locations of
the IP addresses are all in Korea. However, this doesn’t necessarily indicate the threat actor is in
Korea because these IPs may only be some botnets or redirectors.

ICEFOG “Rebirth”：aimed at

misleading or false flagging?
1. Inertial thinking in relevance analysis
Our analysis of Operation OnionDog is mainly based on the data from 360 Threat Intelligence
Center to uncover the associations between different resources. Our major discoveries are the
guise files that pretend to be HWP files and the HWP exploit files taking advantage of HWP files’
vulnerability. They both contain lure documents and OnionDog samples. But HWP exploit files
has one more malicious file type – backdoor (please see the picture below).

Picture 21 Three kinds of derivatives of HWP exploit files

We scanned the malware with our own AntiVirus engine. The result shows the backdoor belongs
to ICEFOG malware families. Further manual analysis verifies that result because distinct features
are

recognized.

For

example,

the

encrypted memory

is

saved

in

the

location

“%TMP%\mstmpdata.dat”. The encrypted data will be decrypted based on XOR logical operation
with the string ‘&*^*@~^%9?i0h’. The C&C of the backdoor is www.sejonng.org. Signs like these
seems all point to the same conclusion.
ICEFOG was revealed by Kaspersky in 2013. HWP exploit files appeared in July, 2014. Through
comparison between the timestamp of the ICEFOG backdoor and its first show-up timein
third-party (VirusTotal) analysis (see table below), it has been proven that the compile timestamp
of ICEFOD backdoor is credible. The fact that the relevant samples already existed before
Kaspersky’s report also directs to the conclusion that the backdoor sample belongs to ICEFOG.

We have testified the backdoor is from ICEFOG samples. The samples of ICEFOG and OnionDog
are both released by the same HWP exploit file. With that said, according to our initial thinking,
we almost believed that the ICEFOG must be associated with OnionDog; furthermore, ICEFOG
even might be the organization behind Operation OnionDog, but is that true?
12

The Icefog APT: A Tale of Cloak and Three
Daggers,https://securelist.com/blog/research/57331/the-icefog-apt-a-tale-of-cloak-and-three-daggers/

2. Truth behind the “smoke curtain”
At the very beginning, we assumed the organization behind OnionDog should be ICEFOG, but
further investigations make us begin to doubt. The active time of OnionDog malicious files is
around the month of July in 2014. Activities of other samples were active in the similar time
windows like October in 2013, July to August in 2017 and July to September in 2015. In addition,
Kaspersky published its report on ICEFOG at the end of September. Usually, after being exposed
by security vendors, it is time when APT organization would cease their attacks and stop using
relevant C&C or backdoors. This time, the threat actor doesn’t follow the regular rule. Of course,
the possibility still exists that the attackers was exposing themselves on purpose as long as they
can reach their goal maximally. However, it makes us begin to doubt our original assumption.

According to the attack time listed above and our experience in APT analysis, there must be other
intentions to explain why the attackers used previous attack methods even though some of the
backdoors and C&C have been unveiled and detected. Regarding their real intentions, our
speculations are:
a. Lack of attack capabilities leave the attackers no choice but to use previous techniques
and resources;
b. Attackers are very confident that they can reach the same goal even if they use old
techniques and resources because they know very well about the targets;
c.

Their real purpose is to fly false flags on other APT organizations or to confuse and
mislead security researchers.

We did some tests on HWP exploit files in virtual environment and found that actually when the
HWP exploit file was triggered, it firstly opened lure documents, and then ran the OnionDog
samples. In the whole process, it didn’t release any ICEFOG samples. That is to say, if users’
computers are attacked by HWP exploit file, only OnionDog samples will be released and run
rather than ICEFOG samples. This phenomenon aroused questions to us: why the attackers
implant a backdoor which they will never use in the following attacks to the HWP exploit?

With this question in mind, we pulled out and arranged all the attacks according to chronological
order to have a better view of the whole cyber-attack campaign. Besides the timestamp of
ICEFOG itself, Kaspersky’s reporting time and the active time of OnionDog samples, there are two

time slots that require more attention which is related to the status of C&C domain
www.sejonng.org.

Picture 22 Timeline of HWP exploit and relevant resources

In the report of ICEFOG from Kaspersky dated to September 25th, 2013, the domain
www.sejonng.org had yet been marked as “SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab”. Later in the historical
data of WHOIS owned by DomainTools13 , we noticed the domain was already marked as
“serverHold14” on January 1st, 2014. What’s more, from the website snapshot15 provided by
DomainTools, it shows that the domain has already been mark as “sinkhole16” by Kaspersky on
June 4th, 2014 or even earlier.

Additionally, the most recent update about domain www.sejonng.org is that it has been taken
over and sinkholed in the WHOIS record17 of virustracker.info.

We deduced that when attackers started to distribute HWP exploit files, the C&C domain of
ICEFOG backdoor has no longer belong to themselves. Combining all the factors above, we came
to the conclusion that our third assumption should be the OnionDog gang’s real purpose: to fly
false flags on other APT organizations or mislead researchers.

Similar circumstance happened in the past APT attacks in which APT organizations used fake
information to obstruct researcher from security companies. Taking the duqu 2.0 Analysis as an
example, researchers from Kaspersky Lab also encountered the situation where the threat actor
added some fake symbols and very rare compression algorithm to direct researchers to believe
the malware was related to APT1 or MiniDuke.

Conclusion

In recent years, APT attacks targeting instruction industries and large corporations are detected
and revealed on a high frequency. Some of them are carried out to damage or destroy industrial
control systems, for instance, Stuxnet and Black Energy; some of them are aimed at information
theft, examples include the attacks plotted by the Lazarus Group which was finally released by
the industry alliance of Kaspersky Labs, Alien Vault Labs and Nevetta. The Operation OnionDog
we introduced here is also one of the latter. Such underground cybercrime can cause a great loss
as well.

In the malicious activities of Operation OnionDog, our researchers noticed that their naming
notations are almost obsessive-compulsively consolidated. Ever since the malicious codes were
created, their PDB paths are surprisingly coherent, for instance, the path of USB Worm is
APT-USB and the one of fishing emails is APT-WebServer. When the Trojan of OnionDog is
released successfully, it will send requests to C&C server to download other malicious programs
and save them in the file folder %temp% with the file names following the same pattern
“XXX_YYY.jpg” and are associated with specific attacking targets. All these signs indicate that the
organization behind OnionDog is very cautious to hide their tracks and has a very rigorous system
and strategic deployment.

In 2014, OnionDog used multiple fixed IPs located in Korea as their server IPs for the Trojans. This

doesn’t necessarily indicate the threat actor is in Korea because these IPs may only some botnets
or redirectors. In 2015, the network communication of OnionDog has been fully upgraded to
Onion.City which is a much more high-end and covert communication method compared to the
existing APT attack.

The fact that ICEFOG samples were found in the HWP exploit files reminds us that OnionDog may
adopt existing techniques and resources of some unveiled APT organizations in order to fly false
flags on others or mislead our researchers. More importantly, this also rings the alarm for us that
without discrimination between the research methods or between intelligence data, any analysis
from single-dimension intending to track the associations has the possibility to lead us to the trap
set by attackers. To reach a much more objective conclusion, we need to analyze from all facets
or dimensions rigorously to avoid any subjective assumption.

In addition, in the speculation of Chapter 5 ICEFOG “Rebirth”, besides building on our own
intelligence information, we also reference the published research and resources of some third
party security vendors like VirusTotal, DomainTools and Kaspersky. With the cross-validation from
multiple resources, the fidelity of the data is greatly guaranteed. Previously, in the contest
between security vendors and cybercrime or APT organizations, resources were severely out of
balance. We hope that from now on the situation will be greatly improved through the
collaboration among security vendors and corporations on APT defense.
