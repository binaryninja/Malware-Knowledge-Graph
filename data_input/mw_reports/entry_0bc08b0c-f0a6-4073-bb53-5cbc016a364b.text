Calisto (aka Callisto, COLDRIVER) is suspected to be a Russian-nexus intrusion set
active since at least April 2017. Although it was not publicly attributed to any Russian
intelligence service, past Calisto operations showed objectives and victimology that align
closely with Russian strategic interests.
Calisto mainly focuses on Western countries, especially the United States, and Eastern
European countries. The group was observed carrying out phishing campaigns aiming at
credential theft, targeting military and strategic research sectors such as NATO entities and
a Ukraine-based defense contractor, as well as NGOs and think tanks. Additional victimology
includes former ntelligence ofﬁcials, experts in Russian matters, and Russian citizens
abroad.
While Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) publicly associated Calisto with Gamaredon Group,
an intrusion set attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) that focuses
essentially on Ukraine operations since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February
2022, this link is not supported by other security companies or researchers. SEKOIA.IO
conducted further technical investigations but did not ﬁnd any overlap between Calisto and
Gamaredon activities.

Technical analysis
Based on SEKOIA.IO EvilNgix trackers, we came across domains, known to us as aligning
with past Calisto activities. Further investigations led to a larger infrastructure composed of
more than 80 domains, including domains typosquatting entites.
As several of these domains were already known and resolving IP addresses already
attributed to Calisto activities, SEKOIA.IO associates these domains to Calisto with high
conﬁdence.
In past observed campaigns, Calisto operators sent malicious PDF attachments to their
victims. The ﬁrst page of the PDF mimics an error in the PDF renderer engine, inciting the
victim to open a link leading to a malicious web page. This webpage aims at gathering the
victim’s credentials by using EvilGinx. Here are a few examples of PDF retrieved in this
investigation:

The last pages of the documents contain blobs of spirals and text, as shown below.
SEKOIA.IO analysts still don’t know why such gibberish is used as it appears useless as an
anti-detection trick. However, the idea to put the phishing link in a PDF instead of in the email
body prevents link analysis from email gateways and is a good tactic to remain undetected
from an attacker point of view.

Victimology analysis
SEKOIA.IO conducted open-source research on the typosquatted domains, to identify
targets. As we redact this paper, we found six private companies based in the US and
Eastern Europe, and four Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), all involved in
Ukraine support. SEKOIA.IO contacted the NGOs to get the phishing email or payload.
One of them shared the email exchange between the victim and the attacker using a
spoofed email from a “trusted source”, including the malicious PDF payload, a technique
previously observed in Calisto campaigns. The email exchange shows that the attacker did
3/7

not include the malicious payload in the ﬁrst email, but waited to get an answer to build a
relationship and avoid suspicion before sending the payload to the victim. That Calisto
social engineering technique was already observed by Microsoft.
Most of the targeted private organizations are involved in military equipment, military
logistics or humanitarian support for Ukraine, including a US company that provides
humanitarian logistics and possibly tactical equipment to Kiev. Other sectors include
communication technologies and cybersecurity (medium conﬁdence) :
UMO, Polish company, military equipment (high conﬁdence);
Emcompass, Ukrainian company, military logistic (high conﬁdence);
DTGruelle, US company, logistics (high conﬁdence);
Global Ordnance, US company, military and tactical equipment (high conﬁdence);
BotGuard, Estonian company, cybersecurity (medium conﬁdence);
Blue Sky Network, US company, satellite communications (high conﬁdence).
Additional potential victims include NGOs and think tanks involved in conﬂict resolution and
war crime investigation, including an organization also involved in the Syrian civil war crime
investigation and previously targeted by an Indian hack-for-hire company in June 2020. Most
of the NGOs and think tanks targeted are publicly supporting Ukraine.
International Center on Nonviolent Conﬂict, US think tank promoting non-military
strategies by civilian-based movements to defend human rights (high conﬁdence);
Commission for International Justice and Accountability, Europe-based NGO,
proof collection for human rights violation and war crime (high conﬁdence);
Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Swiss-based NGO, mediation and diplomacy for
conﬂict resolution (high conﬁdence);
Foundation for support of reforms in Ukraine, Ukraine-based NGO, economic
reforms promotion, likely involved in post-war reconstruction planning (medium
conﬁdence).
SEKOIA.IO notes that the observed victimology through the investigation matches known
Calisto victimology, namely strategic research, civil society and military equipment sectors,
as well as entities and individuals involved in Russian matters.

Calisto targets non-directly related to Ukraine support
Among discovered Calisto malicious domains, three caught SEKOIA.IO analysts’ attention,
mvd-redir[.]ru and dns-mvd[.]ru (high conﬁdence) that are highly likely typosquatting the
Russian Ministry of Interior, and lk-nalog-gov[.]ru (low conﬁdence) the Russian Federal
Taxation Service. Based on the fact that Calisto was observed targeting Russian individuals

4/7

abroad, SEKOIA.IO assess it is plausible that Calisto conducts domestic surveillance
as well. Another less plausible hypothesis would be a false-ﬂag maneuver to raise doubts on
the infrastructure’s attribution.
SEKOIA.IO found another potential victim that matches Calisto known targeting. The domain
sangrail-share[.]com and sangrail-ltd[.]com are typosquatting Sangrail Inc., a private
security
company, registered in the UK on 31 July 2019 by Ian Walter Baharie. That name was used
as well to register AC21, a British private intelligence company focused on African politics.
Interestingly, that name showed up in a 17-years-old data leak exposing a list of several MI6
oﬃcers on cryptome.org, a website dedicated to information leaks. That observation
matches Microsoft assessment on Calisto targeting former intelligence oﬃcers.

Conclusion
Despite the absence of technical evidence associating Calisto activities with a known
Russian cyber offensive service, SEKOIA.IO assess that this intrusion set intelligence
collection activities targeting parties involved in Ukraine support, especially those in the
tactical equipment logistics, probably contribute to Russian efforts to disrupt Kiev supplychain for military reinforcements.

Based on the targeting of Commission for International Justice and Accountability NGO,
SEKOIA.IO assess that Calisto contributes to Russian intelligence collection about
identiﬁed war crime-related evidence and/or international justice procedures, likely to
anticipate and build counter narrative on future accusations.
To provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to
monitor state-sponsored advanced and persistent threats, including Calisto, as well as
cybercrime related groups. We welcome any feedback and / or additional input to further
contribute to understanding and countering Calisto threat.
