The advanced and highly complex spyware first became a media item in February 2014
following extensive analysis by experts at G DATA. Straightaway the indications were that
Uroburos was not designed to target everyday users. Following the cyber attack on the
Belgian Foreign Ministry, information has now been published concerning the affliction of a
government institution.
On Saturday Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders stated that "information and
documents on the crisis in Ukraine" had been smuggled out of the government institution's
networks, reported Die Welt and other news media. At this time neither the origin nor the
nature of the attack had been clarified by official sources. However, Belgian financial
newspaper De Tijd named Moscow as the source of the attack shortly after, and Le Soir was
also connecting it with Russia.

Today: infection by Uroburos rootkit confirmed
"The effort put in by the developers and contracting authorities behind Uroburos is only
justifiable if the targets are worthwhile, i.e. for spying on major enterprises, national
institutions, news services and similar targets," said G DATA experts in their initial blog article
on the subject.
Belgian daily newspaper De Standaard considers the source for their article today to be
trustworthy. It confirmed that the government institution had been infected with the spyware
Uroburos, which is also called "Snake" in some cases. Experts at the military intelligence
service are currently working on counter-measures and cleaning up the network, it said.
French newspaper Le Soir also reported the Uroburos attack on the Belgian government in
today's edition. The Belgian intelligence service is named as the source of the information.

Is this just the tip of the iceberg?
Even though the level of detail of the information that has been publicly disclosed on this
cyber attack is low, and may well remain so, there is nevertheless little doubt that the
Uroburos software has caused significant damage. The G DATA experts expect that the
1/2

recent development in Belgium is just the tip of the iceberg, all the more so since Le Soir
reported last Saturday that other European countries had found the same problem.
