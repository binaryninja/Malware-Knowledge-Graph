On January 14, 2022, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed that they had
arrested and shut down the REvil ransomware gang in Moscow and St. Petersburg cities and
districts in response to the U.S. authorities' request.

This became one of the first and largest Russian-lead operations on arresting cybercrime
group members active against Western countries per U.S. government request.

AdvIntel has extensively tracked any underground chatter and most importantly, the reaction
of other ransomware groups in order to identify if this arrest can significantly shift the
ransomware ecosystem. The ransomware gang members do not believe that the arrest may
lead to any significant changes
Overall, criminals conclude that this arrest was a publicity operation aimed at a formal
public demonstration of Russia's political intent to cooperate with the West on
combating ransomware, by targeting low-tier members of an already defunct group. As
such, this is a single operation and not a defined policy that can affect the cybercrime
domain.
The timing of this arrest is coincidental with the recent U.S.-Russia security talks and
can be directly related to the political discussions within the geopolitical relationships
between the countries.
The arrests are related to the hacking group charged only so far for the "illicit money
control/laundering" and not hacking. This may be defined by the domestic policies
which Russian applies to de-criminalize hacking and criminalize cryptocurrency
anonymity. Such policies aim at bringing a stronger state control over the ransomware
market.

Adversarial Perspective: Underground Insights
Today AdvIntel has extensively tracked any underground chatter and most importantly, the
reaction of other ransomware groups in order to identify if this arrest can significantly shift the
ransomware ecosystem. Our preliminary findings identify a clear consensus within the
ransomware community that the arrest itself is not yet significant since it is a part of a longterm process initiated by Russian law enforcement since Spring 2021. A process associated
with high-profile ransomware attacks against the U.S. critical infrastructure and inherently
related to the broader geopolitical context of US-Russia relationships.
Indeed, previously AdvIntel has identified private statements by ransomware top-affiliates
and leaders in the groups including Avaddon, Darkside, HIVE, and BlackMatter, who
claimed that since Spring 2021, the Russian security apparatus has been applying gradual
pressure on ransomware. For instance, high-profile actors directly affiliated with the
Avaddon gang claimed that it was a direct pressure by the FSB that forced the group to
release security keys. Similar statements were made on underground forums regarding
Darkside and REvil when the groups released attack-related information. Even Conti
ransomware, which is known for its resilience, has expressed concerns over potential
pressure from Russian law enforcement.

As such, the ransomware community remains skeptical of the arrest. AdvIntel's sensitive
source intelligence confirmed that Russian-speaking criminal actors agree that the
individuals who were arrested today are most likely low-tier affiliates who have directly linked
to the REvil auxiliary operations such as money transfers, money laundering, and other
support activities that follow ransomware attacks. In other words, threat actors are confident
that neither developers nor skillful pentesters of REvil have been arrested based on the
AdvIntel insights into the actual affiliate ecosystem.
The broader non-ransomware underground chatter is characterized by generic comments
and moderate support of REvil's arrest. This support is due to the group's poor reputation
across the Russian-speaking cybercrime. Some cheer since Revil was known across the
underground as a group scamming their affiliates, in this sense, the forum actors believe that
the arrest indeed serves some sort of justice.
The underground community agrees that REvil has been continuously making strategic
mistakes by focusing on political publicity, committing political attacks, and attracting media
and public attention. Actors conclude that if a certain group remains within a traditional
cybercrime pass, i.e. being strictly non-public and for-profit, such a group can sustain
peacefully and continue to operate.

(The moderator of the XSS and Exploit forums who is responsible for audit and review of all
ransomware and malware partnerships on these two major forums has been one of the most
consistent critics of REvil)
Actors from the older generation of cybercrime recall their traditional comment that
ransomware is a form of intellectual primitivism, as it does not require sophistication. (read
more in AdvIntel’s research: [DarkWeb Insights] The Digital "Thief War": How COVID-19
Pandemic Triggered a Generational Conflict). They add that due to this primitivism it was not
surprising that ransomware operators were caught so easily.
Overall, criminals conclude that this arrest was a publicity operation aimed at a formal public
demonstration of Russia's political intent to cooperate with the West on combating
ransomware, by targeting low-tier members of an already defunct group. As such, this is a
single operation and not a defined policy that can affect the cybercrime domain.

AdvIntel’s analysis: Geopolitics and cryptocurrencies; is Russia a "Safe Haven" for
hackers?
De-Escalation Rollercoaster
The timing of this arrest is coincidental with the recent US-Russia security talks and can be
directly related to the political discussions within the geopolitical relationships between the
countries.

AdvIntel previously noted on this connection between geopolitics and cybercrime in the
context of the Avaddon group security key release. Since May 2021, we observe a clear
intervention of politics into the cybercrime domain, including multiple statements made by the
Russian government, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by President Putin
personally about establishing an international Russian-American initiative to establish a joint
cybersecurity landscape. The Russian officials likely see this as a tool of de-escalating the
US-Russian relationships.
Today’s situation mimics the May 2021 case, when troops were also concentrated on the
Ukrainian border (cyberattacks against Ukrainian government entities occurred on the day of
REvil arrest), and Russia was facing threats of domestic turbulence. Indeed, the Russian

5/9

government traditionally goes through rounds of escalation and de-escalation with the West.
Just like in Spring 2021, the Kremlin may now be aiming to create a framework of stability in
the international arena and cybersecurity - a controversial space or the Russia-U.S.
relationship is once again on the frontlines of this de-escalation agenda.

(The REvil arrest happened on the same day as a massive attack on Ukrainian the websites
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies that are
temporarily down. The attack happened during another round of escalation of tensions on
Ukraine-Russia border)

What is even more interesting is the domestic context. AdvIntel’s CEO Vitali Kremez noted
that the arrests are related to the hacking group charged only so far for the "illicit money
control/laundering" and not hacking.

This may be a consequence of deliberate legal modeling which Russia has been using since
the 2000th.
Indeed, the Russian Criminal Code’s Articles 272, 273, and further, which define punishment
for hacking only presume minimum sentences of 1 year for “Illegal access to computer
information protected by law, if this act has caused the destruction, blocking, modification or
copying of computer information”. The sentence can reach 2-3 years if the crime was
committed by a group of people and for-profit and 4 years if the accused has performed
insider crime by using their position in an entity.
This way, the specific development of the Russian criminal code in regards to hacking,
makes long-term sentences of hackers unlikely. (Note: the Russian criminal code also limits
the accumulation of sentence years based on different charges, in other words, the lengths
of the sentence is defined by the strongest charge and not by the combination of different
charges which do not sum up)
This can explain why REvil members were charged with the illicit funds' charge that has a
maximum sentence of seven years, and this may not be a simple judicial compilation but a
consequence of Russian domestic policies.

Previously, AdvIntel has investigated a major change in Russian legislation regarding
cryptocurrencies: New Russian Crypto Law - A Government Tool to Take Control Over the
DarkWeb Market? We predicted that by introducing the January 1, 2021, law regulating
cryptocurrencies, the Russian government aims to seek control over the ransomware sector
of the illicit economy that became extremely prolific over the past two years. We assessed
that by establishing this crypto law, the Russian government built a legal foundation to take
over ransomware “businesses”. Tightened on cryptocurrency flows and obligated to report
their balances, hackers will no longer be able to “legally” stay in the shade. The criminal
enterprise might be easily taken down completely or more likely to be obligated to cooperate
with the government for its financial and national good.

Interestingly enough, on January 13, 2022, the day before the REvil arrest, Alexander
Bastrykin, the Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee and one of the top
government officials demanded mandatory deanonymization of all cryptocurrency holders in
Russia. He specifically stated that the anonymity associated with cryptocurrency manifests in
major risks for public safety.
All these are signs that domestically Russia is aiming to keep its hacking-related legislation
mild and ambiguously defined, while significantly cracking down on cryptocurrencies. This
way, loyal hackers can still operate freely, while those who are chosen as a target of the state
can be charged with illicit funds law within the broader context of criminalization of
cryptocurrency use. REvil’s arrest may be defined by these dynamics.
