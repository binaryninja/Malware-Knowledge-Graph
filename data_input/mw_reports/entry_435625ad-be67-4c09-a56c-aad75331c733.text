Summary
Emissary Panda, a group that goes by many names (APT27, IronTiger, BronzeUnion, TG3390, and LuckyMouse), is a Chinese APT that is suspected of being active for nearly a
decade. This group has been known to target aerospace, government, defense, technology,
energy, and manufacturing sectors. Not much activity has been publicly recorded on this
group as of late, but research indicates they are not dormant.

Analysis
While performing research, I identified a suspect binary titled “odbcad32.exe”. What
immediately piqued my interest was that this binary, while having the appearance of the
legitimate “Open Database Connectivity Data Source Administrator utility” by Microsoft, was
not signed with a Microsoft certificate. Instead, this binary was signed with a certificate
belonging to “Hangzhou Bianfeng Networking Technology Co., Ltd.”. Open source research
on this company name indicates that it is a Chinese software company, and a subsidiary of
the media organization “Zhejiang Daily Digital”, which is headquartered in Hangzhou, China.

At this point, I decided to dig deeper into this binary and see why it was attempting to
disguise itself as a legitimate Microsoft utility. Upon execution, the binary would elevate
privileges and drop two files - odbccx32.dll in the C:\Windows\system32\ folder, and a
randomly named batch file in the user’s local temp folder.
@echo off
:err
del "c:\Users\[Username]\Desktop\odbcad32.exe" >nul
if exist "c:\Users\[Username]\Desktop\odbcad32.exe" goto err
>nul
@echo on
del "c:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\[random].bat"

Net.exe was then launched with the parameters “stop “Remote Registry Configuration””.
Next, rundll32.exe loads the aforementioned “odbccx32.dll”, and then another net.exe is
launched with the parameters “start “Remote Registry Configuration””. Once the malicious
DLL is loaded via rundll32.exe, it then establishes persistence via a new service. Cmd.exe
then executes the dropped batch file, which deletes the originally executed file, as well as the
batch file itself.

Following this, Svchost.exe is executed and loads the malicious odbccx32.dll. It then drops
the file “autochk.sys” in the C:\Windows\system32\drivers\ folder, and reads the hosts file
located in the C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts folder (this file contains the mappings
of IP addresses to host names). Command & Control is then initiated to
“yofeopxuuehixwmj.redhatupdater.com” over ports 53, 80, and 443. While this domain
currently resolves to 80.85.153.176, no response was received from probing attempts, and
no secondary payload was observed.

The TTP’s (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) observed in this sample are consistent with
those seen in past attacks conducted by the Emissary Panda APT group, specifically in
relation to the ZxShell Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which they have been observed using.
I then pivoted into VirusTotal’s relational graphing utility to see if I could gather additional
information on this campaign’s infrastructure. This revealed four structurally similar binaries
that I suspect of also being ZxShell RAT installers - one of which beaconed to the same
Command & Control server as the original sample (yofeopxuuehixwmj.redhatupdater.com).
The second and third binaries beaconed to language.wikaba.com and solution.instanthq.com
- both of which have been documented as being Command & Control servers for past
Emissary Panda APT campaigns. I was unable to confirm the fourth binary being a ZxShell
RAT installer, which beacons to awvsf7esh.dellrescue.com, however VirusTotal deems that it
is structurally similar to previously confirmed installers. Please note that the domain
“dellrescue.com” has been documented by Cylance as having been used in a campaign
conducted by PassCV APT group in 2016, although the subdomain utilized was different
(sc.dellrescue.com).

3/5

Shown above: VirusTotal Graph
At this time, I was unable to obtain evidence of target attribution - however in the past
Emissary Panda APT has been observed targeting Asia, Middle East, US, and UK based
organizations and infrastructure. What struck me as most interesting from my analysis of this
sample was how the Emissary Panda APT group was able to obtain a valid certificate to sign
their Remote Access Trojan binary, which sparks the question - was this group able to
compromise the Chinese based software company and steal their certificate(s), or are there
possible insider threats lurking within? Regardless, it is an interesting sample and displays
that Emissary Panda is still active.
