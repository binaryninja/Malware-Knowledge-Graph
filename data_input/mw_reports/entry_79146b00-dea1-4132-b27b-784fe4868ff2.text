Clop ransomware is claiming to have stolen 2 million credit cards from E-Land Retail over a
one-year period ending with last months ransomware attack.
E-Land Retail, a subsidiary of E-Land Global, operates numerous retail clothing stores,
including New Core and NC Department Store.
Last month, E-Land Retail had to shut down 23 NC Department Store and New Core
locations after suffering a CLOP ransomware attack.
At the time of the attack, E-Land Retail stated that sensitive customer data was safe as it
was encrypted on another server.
"Although this ransomware attack caused some damage to the company's network and
system, Customer information and sensitive data are encrypted on a separate server."

"It is in a safe state because it is managed," E-Land Retail CEO Chang-Hyun
Seok disclosed in a notice on their web site.
However, in an interview with BleepingComputer, the CLOP ransomware operators claimed
to have breached E-Land over a year ago and have been quietly stealing credit cards using
POS malware installed on the network.
"Over a year ago, we hacked their network, everything is as usual. We thought what to do,
installed POS malware and left it for a year. Before the lock, the cards were collected and
deciphered, for a whole year the company did not suspect and did nothing," the CLOP gang
told BleepingComputer.
Using the installed POS malware, CLOP told BleepingComputer that they stole the Track 2
data for 2 million credit cards over the past year.

Redacted sample of Track 2 data allegedly stolen by CLOP
POS malware is used to scan the memory of point-of-sale (POS) terminals as credit card
transactions occur. When credit card data is detected, the malware copies the credit card
information as Track 1 or Track 2 data and transmits it back to the threat actor's server.

The stolen credit cards that CLOP claims to have stolen are in the form of Track 2 data,
which includes a credit card number, the expiration date, and other information. It does not,
though, contain a credit cards CVV code, so threat actors can only use it to create fake
credit cards for in-store purchases.
CLOP also told BleepingComputer that they targeted approximately 90k IP addresses, but
are unsure as to how many were actually encrypted.
BleepingComputer has made repeated attempts to contact E-Land Global and E-Land
Retail but have not received a reply to our emails.
