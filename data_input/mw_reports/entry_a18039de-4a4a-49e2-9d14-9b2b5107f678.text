In 2019, PwC observed an increase in activity by North Korea-based threat actor Black
Banshee, also known as ‘Kimsuky’.
In our previous blog, we examined some of the tradecraft exhibited by Black Banshee in its
infrastructure setup. We discussed the threat actor’s reliance on certain IP ranges and
domains, as well as its naming conventions for malicious domains and command and control
server paths.
In this article we look at how the threat actor’s 2019 campaigns (even those continuing into
2020) can be broadly grouped into three main “clusters” – and how all these, in turn, are
complementary to its overarching strategic objectives in the context of current international
relations.

Clustering activity
1/5

Investigating Black Banshee’s 2019 activity, and the infrastructure patterns emerging across
different campaigns and connecting them, we identified a number of activity “clusters”. Such
clusters of campaigns and operations – identified based on our own datasets as well as
excellent open source research from others – are tied together by infrastructure links, similar
tradecraft, shared indicators, and matching targeting.
Figure 1 below shows the activity of several campaigns – grouped into such clusters –
between November 2018 and February 2020:
The WildCommand cluster;
The BabyShark cluster; and,
A credential harvesting cluster.

The Wild Cluster
The WildCommand cluster includes the activity first publicly detailed in AhnLab’s Operation
Kabar Cobra. The continuation of that activity was exposed in ThreatRecon’s Operation Kitty
Phishing. We tracked this campaign as it continued throughout April and May 2019.
All this activity targeted the South Korean government sector, as well as aerospace and
defence contractors and cryptocurrency organisations doing business in South Korea. Based
on our analysis, we assessed that the operations were effectively part of the same
overarching campaign, as they exhibited extensive overlaps in infrastructure and
correspondence in tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) deployed – including a new
malware family at the time, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that we referred to as
WildCommand.

We found further infrastructure links tying the WildCommand cluster to a campaign targeting
cryptocurrency organisations, and active from 2018 until at least May 2019, which EST
Security has grouped under the name “Operation MoneyHolic”.
We also saw multiple infrastructure connections between the WildCommand cluster and yet
another set of activity, dated around May 2019, leveraging a DLL RAT family that we refer to
as MyDogs. MyDogs – a RAT that uses FTP to receive commands and exfiltrate files – was
reported on as being used in a cluster of activity called “Operation Red Salt” by AhnLab, in a
campaign mostly targeted towards South Korean entities. Although the set of activity that
AhnLab called Operation Red Salt was active around July 2019, we observed the leadup for
this campaign building from at least May 2019 – around the time when we also noticed a
temporary halt in the activity associated with Operation WildCommand.

2/5

Recently, we have observed new WildCommand activity. This return of the WildCommand
campaign used similar TTPs to previous activity and a slightly updated version of the
backdoor, with samples compiled around 13th February 2020; from what we have been able
to observe so far, this activity targeted financial sector entities in South East Asia.

The BabyShark cluster
The second cluster that PwC identified across Black Banshee’s 2019 activity revolves
around a campaign, active since at least late 2018, that Palo Alto’s Unit42 called
“BabyShark” and EST Security refers to as “Operation SmokeScreen”. This campaign has
consistently targeted policy and national security think tanks as well as government entities
in the US, South Korea, and European countries. It has also targeted organisations in the
cryptocurrency space.
We noted infrastructure overlaps and indicator sharing between this and Prevailion’s
“Autumn Aperture” report, including similar malware and the same author name –
“windosmb” – present across multiple lure documents utilised in both campaigns. Such
evidence led us to assess that the Autumn Aperture campaign likely constituted a
continuation of the BabyShark campaign.

BabyShark activity often relied on compromised infrastructure instead of adversaryregistered domains. However, the naming of server-side folders remained consistent across
BabyShark campaigns. Folders like “/customize/1111”, server-side files like “cow.php”,
“expres.php”, and malware parameters like “op=” remained characteristic of BabyShark
malware through its iterations until the current time.
PwC analysts have routinely observed such server-side scripts on Black Banshee C2
infrastructure. These same server-side scripts were also observed in the context of a
campaign targeting the South Korean government and dubbed “Operation Stealth Power” by
EST Security. Although Operation Stealth Power was not directly linked to BabyShark
activity, the use of those same scripts effectively ties together different Black Banshee
campaigns based on the same infrastructure management TTPs.

A net cast wide: long-running, large-scale credential capture campaign
Separately, Prevailion noted some shared indicators and infrastructure connecting the
“Autumn Aperture” campaign with activity discussed in a report by the Agence Nationale de
la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information (ANSSI), and also covered by Anomali in a late
August 2019 report. Multiple infrastructure connections (examples of which are shown in
Figure 4 above) and targeting similarities between the BabyShark campaign, Autumn
Aperture, and the ANSSI report, lead us to assess these sets of activity are likely part of the

3/5

same “cluster”. This is an overarching effort to target mainly foreign governments as well as
institutions in the national security, policy, and education space – with multiple similarities
across the domains that we observed being set up between August and December 2018.

Conclusion
Both the WildCommand and BabyShark activity cluster – as well as the credential harvesting
campaigns that PwC, ANSSI and Anomali have been tracking since at least 2018 – mainly
targeted entities and organisations in South Korean and the United States. These
campaigns’ operations focused on the following targets:
Government (especially foreign governments, ministries, and diplomatic missions);
National security (especially with regards to national security policy, defence, and North
Korea-related affairs);
Aerospace and defence,
International relations and sanctions;
Nuclear-related policy; and,
Academia and research (especially in the nuclear space).
In this two-part series, we demonstrated how – within the horizon of PwC’s intelligence and
visibility, as well as of open source research – most of the campaigns conducted by Black
Banshee in 2019 actually turned out to be interlinked, in terms of:
Infrastructure overlaps crossing over multiple campaigns and betraying the threat
actor’s overall modus operandi; and,
Overall mission objectives, showing consistent targeting by Black Banshee.
We have seen Black Banshee introduce new tooling (like the WildCommand and MyDogs
RATs, and BabyShark malware), and assess it is likely that the threat actor will continue
updating its toolset in upcoming campaigns.
However, as we saw throughout 2019, Black Banshee continues to rely on a series of triedand-tested mechanisms, with distinctive operational tradecraft that emerges across its
campaigns. Going into 2020, we have not observed this activity decreasing or becoming less
aggressive, nor do we expect it do so – in fact, we expect Black Banshee to continue
ramping up operations, especially in the face of the current international state of heightened
tension.
