The ACSC has observed increased targeting activity against the Australian health sector by

Alert status
HIGH
The ACSC has observed increased targeting activity against the Australian health sector by
actors using the SDBBot Remote Access Tool (RAT).
SDBBot is comprised of 3 components; an installer which establishes persistence, a loader
which downloads additional components, and the RAT itself. Once installed, malicious
actors will use SDBBot to move laterally within a network and exfiltrate data. SDBBot is a
known precursor of the Clop ransomware.
While the recently observed activity is targeting the health sector, the ACSC recommends
that all network owners review their controls against ransomware as per ACSCâ€™s publication
Ransomware in Australia.
