Without doubt, one of the hottest and most stressful regions on the planet currently is
Eastern Europe. The military conflict that has been ongoing for more than 4 months has
unfortunately claimed many victims and is fueling an economic and food crisis in several
nations spanning across the globe. This far reaching tension also bleeds into cyberspace.

The tools used by threat actors aimed at Ukraine and neighboring countries are constantly
changing. In many cases, the context of successful attacks is the use of documents in email
attachments. We will consider some of the novelties of attackers that target Ukrainian
government organizations. When these tools shattered like grains of sand, we named it
GlowSand.
The first document, the analysis of which we would like to provide, we discovered on June 25
in InQuest Labs.

When the document is opened, the user will receive the following table, appearing to be a
military payroll.

Content
Payroll allegedly intended for military unit A4267, which is a real military unit which is located
in the west of Ukraine. Detection on VirusTotal is very shallow.

The malware download server is configured in such a way that it only allows downloading
files for Ukrainian IP addresses.

With the right client setup, we were able to get 4 files.

After loading one of these files, the first stage document starts the next stage. We noticed
that the payload changes every few hours. We were able to find one such shift. In total, we
were able to obtain 3 document files.

Figure 4: Malicous Macro
The obfuscated macro is decoded at runtime and is divided into two parts. The first part
creates a file in the directory “C:\Users\Admin\deprive.pdf” This file shows extremely low
VirusTotal detection at the time of analysis.

Figure 6: Part 1 Deobfuscated
This code creates a new task in Task Scheduler called “HotStart”; and every 5 minutes will
run the script “C:\Users\Admin\deprive.pdf”. Thus, the attacker has achieved persistence on
the target host.

Figure 7: Part 2 Deobfuscated
With a request txxp://ip-api.com/csv/delicious71.kolopartor[.]ru?fields=query The script gets
the IP address of the domain.

Next, the following data is sent to the remote server.
%userprofile%
%systemdrive%
%computername%
If the threat actors are interested in the system on which they were able to execute this code,
they will later send further code to deploy the infrastructure.
>The actor constantly changes their tools to either low detection or lightweight recon of
system information before retrieving the main payload. This is clearly seen in the following
.lnk file.

A file containing a link to hxxp://a0681546.xsph[.]ru/death/quickly.xml launches when the file
is opened. The server on which this quickly.xml is located is also configured in such a way
that it responds to requests with Ukrainian IP addresses.

The next-stage payload retrieved from hxxp://zvonishu[.]ru/get.php is geofenced to deliver
only to Ukrainian based systems. This domain is less than a month old and was created on
2022-05-25 and currently hosted on IP 95.179.216[.]77. Pivoting via reverse DNS we’re able
to identify the following likely related and also recently registered domains:

The next-stage payload takes a screenshot and gathers identifying machine information to
post back to the same server and assuming conditions are met, downloads the next stage of
the malware:
