Main findings of 2021
Every year Kaspersky analyzes the use of stalkerware around the world to better
understand the threat it poses. We partner with stakeholders across public and private
sectors to raise awareness and find solutions to best tackle this important issue.
Stalkerware enables people to secretly spy on other people’s private lives via smart
devices and is often used to facilitate psychological and physical violence against intimate
partners. The software is commercially available and can access an array of personal data,
including device location, browser history, text messages, social media chats, photos and
more. The marketing of stalkerware is not illegal, but its use without the victim’s consent
is. Perpetrators benefit from this vague legal framework that still exists in many countries.
Stalkerware is a breach of privacy and a form of tech abuse. To address this complex threat
in a comprehensive way that best supports victims and survivors, innovative tools from a
legislative, social and technological point of view are needed.

2021 data highlights

2

•

In 2021, Kaspersky’s data shows that 32,694 unique users were affected by
stalkerware globally. This is a decrease from our 2020 numbers and a historic low
since we first started gathering data on stalkerware in 2018. While this could be seen
as a reason for celebration, it is not.

•

Cyber-violence is on the rise, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. As
people have continued to socialize less and spend more time at home, perpetrators feel
more in control, possibly making them less prone to installing stalkerware to spy on their
partner. In addition, abusers, unfortunately, have a wider range of means, in the form of
smart devices, to spy on or stalk their victims. Non-profit organizations (NPOs) with which
Kaspersky works closely have shared similar observations from working with perpetrators
and victims of stakerware. It is important to remember that these numbers only include
Kaspersky users: they do not take into account users who use the IT security solutions
of our competitors or those who do not have any IT security solutions installed on their
mobiles. Therefore, we see only the tip of the iceberg: while it is difficult to calculate
the exact number of affected users in the world, members from the Coalition against
Stalkerware estimate that it could be at least 30 times higher, with close to one million
victims globally, each year.

Methodology
The data in this report has been taken
from aggregated threat statistics
obtained from the Kaspersky Security
Network. The Kaspersky Security Network
is dedicated to processing cybersecurityrelated data streams from millions of
volunteer participants around the world.
All received data is anonymized. To
calculate our statistics, we review the
consumer line of Kaspersky’s mobile
security solutions applying only the
Coalition Against Stalkerware’s detection
criteria on stalkerware. This means that
the affected number of users were
targeted by stalkerware only. Other types
of monitoring or spyware apps that fall
outside of the Coalition’s definition are not
included in our statistics.
The statistics reflect unique mobile users
affected by stalkerware: this is different
from the number of detections. The
number of detections can be higher as we
may detect stalkerware several times on
the same device of the same unique user
if they decided not to remove the app
after receiving our notification.

Common functionalities of stalkerware applications
This section lists the stalkerware applications that are the most used to control mobile
devices on a global level. Cerberus and Reptilicus were the most used stalkerware
applications with 5,575 and 4,417 affected users, respectively, globally.
Application name

Are Android OS and
iOS equally affected by
stalkerware?
Stalkerware tools are less frequent on
iPhones than Android devices because
iOS is traditionally a closed system.
However, perpetrators can work around
this limitation on jailbroken iPhones, but
they still require direct physical access to
the phone to jailbreak it. iPhone users who
fear surveillance should always keep an
eye on their device.
Alternatively, an abuser can offer their
victim an iPhone – or any other device –
with pre-installed stalkerware. There are
many companies that make these services
available online, allowing abusers to have
these tools installed on new phones, which
can then be delivered in factory packaging
under the guise of a gift to the intended
victim.

Table 8 - 2021’s top list of stalkerware applications

Stalkerware applications can give tremendous power and access to its users, depending
on the applications and whether they are used in free or paying mode. Some of them are
marketed as anti-theft or parental control applications, however, they are different in
many ways, beginning with the fact that they work in stealth mode without the consent
and knowledge of the victim.
Most of the popular applications provide common stalkerware functionality such as:
•

Hiding app icon

•

Reading SMS, MMS and call logs

•

Getting lists of contacts

The use of stalkerware may be

The number of affected users
and some of the behaviors and
perceptions around the use of
stalkerware are still concerning

While we observe a decrease of 39% of affected users from our 2020 data, the fight against
stalkerware and against cyber violence is far from over. The number of affected users and
some of the behaviors and perceptions around the use of stalkerware are still concerning. In
November 2021, Kaspersky commissioned a global survey of more than 21,000 participants
in 21 countries on their attitudes towards privacy and digital stalking in intimate relationships.
While the majority of respondents (70%) do not believe it is acceptable to monitor their
partner without consent, a significant share of people (30%) doesn’t see any issue with it
and find it acceptable under certain circumstances. Of those who think there are justifiable
reasons for secret surveillance, almost two thirds would engage in the behavior if they
believed their partner was being unfaithful (64%) or if it was related to their safety (63%) and
half would if they believed their partner was involved in criminal activities (50%).

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

ICT technologies are powerful
tools for perpetrators exerting
coercive control, especially in
relationships where violence is
already present offline

High-speed internet in conjunction with the rapid spread of information and
communication technology (ICT) has supported cyber-violence by creating another tool
for abusers to share violent and dangerous materials or engage in behaviors that affect
emotional, psychological or physical damage. While these technologies have given people
the ability to maintain social and emotional relationships across wide-ranging physical
distances, ICT has also enabled cyber-violence – a consequence that’s far-reaching
effects extend to the offline world with real-life negative impacts on its victims.
The results of our survey corroborate this, with 15% of respondents worldwide being
required by their partner to install a monitoring app and 34% of those also experiencing
physical and/or verbal abuse by that intimate partner.
While it is too early to make definitive conclusions on the decrease of affected users in
2021, there are two theories that could explain this trend.
Firstly, we believe that all aspects of our lives are still heavily impacted by the pandemic.
Recent studies show that new behaviors are emerging across areas of life such as work,
learning, home, consumption, communications and information, travel and mobility. In
short, people are staying at home more (49% avoid leaving their homes and 50% are
working from home partially or entirely), reducing face to face interactions (57% indicate
that they are socially distancing from friends and the community) and traveling, and
shopping, educating and entertaining themselves increasingly online. From an abuser’s
point of view, this could result in less need to spy on their partner, who is now in their
sight most of the time.
Secondly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitization are now everywhere in our lives.
It fills our daily routines and our homes, cars and offices. While the opportunities and
advantages are endless, many devices also enable tracking by third parties. Our research
suggests that perpetrators might also use other means, aside from stalkerware, to track
their partners, with 50% of respondents to our survey indicating that they have been
tracked through phone apps, another 29% mentioning they had been traced through
tracking devices, 22% through webcams and 18% through smart home devices.
Apple’s recent January 2022 publication of a safety manual for its AirTag product marks a
shift in the perception of the situation.
NNEDV, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and WWP EN, the European
Network for the Work with Perpetrators of Domestic Violence share with us their
experience and views on these two theories and on tech abuse in general.

WWP EN
The European Network for the Work
With Perpetrators of domestic
violence (WWP EN) is a membership
association of organizations directly
or indirectly working with people
who perpetrate violence in close
relationships. The main focus of
WWP EN is violence perpetrated by
men against women and children. The
mission of WWP EN is to improve the
safety of women and their children
and others at risk from violence
in close relationships, through the
promotion of effective work with
those who perpetrate this violence,
mainly men.

How measures imposed by governments during the pandemic
facilitated and reinforced perpetrators’ coercive control — Berta

Vall Castelló, Research and Development manager and Anna McKenzie,
Communications manager at WWP EN

Coercive control is defined as “a pattern of abusive behavior designed to exercise
domination and control over the other party to a relationship. It can include a range of
abusive behaviors – physical, psychological, emotional or financial – the cumulative effect
of which over time robs victim-survivors of their autonomy and independence as an
individual” (McGorrery and McMahon, 2020). As we write in our manual “Same Violence,
New Tools – How to work with violent men who use cyberviolence,” perpetrators isolate
their partners and make them emotionally dependent. They use assaults, threats,
intimidation, humiliation, isolation and more to create a constant sense of fear, as well as a
general loss of a sense of freedom. ICT technologies are powerful tools for perpetrators
exerting coercive control, especially in relationships where violence is already present
offline.
A recent review on domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic found that
the measures imposed by the government during lockdown facilitate and reinforce
perpetrators’ coercive control. The authors suggested that the conditions of isolation/
physical distancing imposed by the governments overlap with coercive control strategies
used by perpetrators to control their partners (Pentaraki and Speake, 2020). Considering
these results, it seems likely that perpetrators feel less of a “need” to use stalkerware to
exert coercive control over their partners. Moreover, recent research has observed that
technology-facilitated abuse often escalates during a period of separation (George and
Harris 2014; Woodlock 2016). Therefore, during a lockdown situation where couples were
forced to stay together at home, they are less likely to use technology-facilitated abuse.

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

We must remember that a decrease in the use of stalkerware does not equal a decrease
in overall intimate partner violence (IPV) during the pandemic. On the contrary, Boxall,
Morgan and Brown (2020) note that IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, the results in this report indicate that stalkerware has been replaced with
other tools. As Elena Gajotto, from Italian NGO Una Casa per l’Uomo, remarks: “It is so
easy to monitor and track someone, for example by using their Google account, that you
don’t really need to use stalkerware.” The wide variety of possible technology-facilitated
abuse might have had an impact on the decrease in the use of stalkerware specifically.
Letizia Baroncelli, from Italian NGO Centro Ascolto Uomini Malttratanti (CAM), agrees
and adds: “I think we see less stalkerware because there are so many other forms of
perpetrating digital abuse.”

The measures imposed by the
government during lockdown
facilitate and reinforce
perpetrators’ coercive control

However, NGOs, governments and researchers have reported a substantial increase
in image-based abuse and sextortion since the start of the pandemic (Boniello, 2020;
CCRI, personal communication, June 2, 2020; FBI, 2020, 2021). It seems that this type of
technology-facilitated abuse has escalated, especially among teenagers and couples
who do not live together. As Letizia Baroncelli notes: “Sharing personal pictures has
increased a lot since the pandemic, especially among young perpetrators. They do not
understand that they are committing a crime.” As Elena Gajotto adds: “Image-based
abuse causes devastating harm to the women who experience it, while the men don’t
even understand that they did something bad.”
Several WWP EN members have shared that the most common form of digital violence is
men monitoring their partners’ digital activities, e.g. by checking emails, phones and social
accounts. This is in line with observations from Daniel Antunovic, from Croatian NGO
UZOR, who agrees that the ‘primitive’ forms of digital stalking are the ones he sees most
often.
At WWP EN, we consider it key to focus on tech-facilitated abuse to ensure victim
safety. Elena Gajotto adds: “Around half of the men share their digital violence, without
realizing that this is abuse. If we don’t explicitly focus on this violence in our work with
perpetrators, it doesn’t come up.” Therefore, there is a need to increase the capacity

10

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

of professionals working with perpetrators and professionals working with victims of
domestic violence to screen for and intervene in cases of digital violence. As Daniel
Antunovic adds: “We haven’t encountered as many cases of digital violence as I expected
since COVID-19. However, technology-facilitated abuse is in some ways like sexualized
violence. It happens a lot, but it remains hidden.”

There is a growing rate of “smart devices” used in intimate partner
violence — Toby Shulruff, Tech Safety Project Manager at NNEDV
While stalkerware is a common concern, there are many other tools available for tech
abuse that may appear to be stalkerware, but are not. For example, personal information
available online and the everyday features of devices and accounts can be used to find
a person’s location or track their activity. The complexity and connections between
devices, accounts, and information on the internet can make it difficult for victims and
those who work with them to assess what’s happening, and to implement an effective
response. It can be terrifying and overwhelming for a survivor to realize an abuser knows
multiple details about their everyday lives.
Unfortunately, there is a growing rate of “smart” devices— including home assistants,
connected appliances, and security systems connected to WiFi networks and
smartphones—used in intimate partner violence.
In a survey conducted by the NNEDV in December 2020 and January 2021, responses
revealed an increase in every type of tech abuse during the pandemic. While phones are
the technology most often misused, NNEDV’s needs assessment shows this to be the
case 87% of the time, “smart” or connected devices were also identified as technologies
that are increasingly misused in the context of tech abuse, seen regularly by about a third
of support professionals.

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

As more people adopt the use of IoT devices, this will likely grow. These products are
intended to increase convenience and efficiency. The manufacture of IoT devices is
a rapidly emerging global market with both larger, well-established players as well as
many smaller, newer companies1. IoT is made possible by several overlapping trends in
technology: miniaturization, increased processing capacity, increased data storage,
decreased cost of manufacturing, and connectivity.

There is a growing rate of
“smart” devices — including
home assistants, connected
appliances, and security
systems connected to Wi-Fi
networks and smartphones —
used in intimate partner
violence

12

Due to a variety of factors - market pressures, the rapid emergence of the technology,
and the complexity of the IoT - profound risks to security and privacy are increasingly
apparent2. Smart home devices in particular are being misused in the context of intimate
partner violence to control, threaten, and cause harm to victims. [Researchers at the
Gender + IoT project at University College London3 have been exploring these harms]
[and proposing remedies in partnership with support professionals in the field.]
NNEDV’s recent needs assessment documented increases in tech abuse tactics
throughout the pandemic. We are concerned that as we emerge from this public health
crisis, abusers who have adopted these tactics or have increased their misuse of
technology during this time will not have any incentive to discontinue this form of abuse.
Recent research4 suggests support professionals should ask about all kinds of tech
abuse, including stalkerware and smart home devices. There is a strong likelihood the
spike in tech abuse support professionals have seen will stay with us. It’s imperative we
continue to support victims, and work to prevent technology abuse.

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

How Kaspersky and its partners are
collaborating to fight stalkerware
The threat of stalkerware is not just a technical problem: all parts of society need to be
involved in resolving the issue. For the past few years, Kaspersky has been at the forefront
of the stalkerware debate. We are reaching out to public and private stakeholders to better
understand this issue and find common solutions. We are contributing to the development
of training materials and practical tools to support non-profit organizations, corporations,
institutions and individuals with developing resilience to stalkerware. We are organizing
and participating in webinars and roundtables with institutions to share our voices and
contribute to discussions that will shape tomorrow’s legislation.
Kaspersky is one of the co-founders and drivers of the Coalition Against Stalkerware
(CAS) — an international working group dedicated to tackling stalkerware and combating
domestic violence. The Coalition brings together organizations that work with victims
and abusers, digital activists and cybersecurity vendors. It is a unique platform that
enables all relevant stakeholders to share best practices and join forces to tackle the
issue of stalkerware.
Kaspersky is also one of the partners of the DeStalk project. Funded by the European
Commission, this research project aims to develop a strategy to train and support
professionals working in victims support services and perpetrator programmes, officers
of institutions and local governments along with other relevant groups. The consortium
plans to upgrade and test existing tools for practitioners and is developing a regional pilot
awareness campaign in Italy.
In 2021, we teamed up with INTERPOL and two respected non-profit organizations
from the US and Australia to provide law enforcement officials with two online training
sessions. These courses were attended by over 210 participants from around the world.
At the end of 2021, Kaspersky also participated in an event, “Combating violence against
women in a digital age - utilising the Istanbul Convention”, organized by the Council of
Europe. This event was an opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the Group of
Experts on combating violence against women and domestic violence (GREVIO).

TinyCheck: a tool to support victims of domestic violence
Kaspersky’s work with the TinyCheck tool is an initiative worth highlighting. It is a free,
open-source tool developed and supported by Kaspersky. Initially created to help
NPOs protect victims of domestic violence and their privacy, TinyCheck facilitates the
detection of stalkerware on victims’ devices and on any OS in a simple, quick and noninvasive way without making the perpetrator aware. While security solutions can also
check for and alert about stalkerware, they need to be installed on the device, so there is
a risk of the perpetrator also being alerted. Developments like the TinyCheck tool aim to
ensure that survivors can use their devices without concerns about being surveilled.

With TinyCheck, no application needs to be installed on the device to perform the
check, and the results of the check are not displayed on or transmitted to the potentially
infected device. In addition, TinyCheck allows victims to check any device regardless
of whether it uses iOS, Android or another OS. These features address the two major
issues in the fight to protect users against stalkerware. The tool has been developed
to run on a Raspberry Pi, using a regular Wi-Fi connection. TinyCheck quickly analyzes
a mobile device’s outgoing traffic and identifies Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such
as interactions with known malicious sources like stalkerware-related servers. Currently,
the tool uses IOCs collected not only by Kaspersky researchers but also by repositories
maintained by independent security researchers (special thanks to Etienne Maynier, also
known as Tek, from Echap and Cian Heasley). We hope that the community will continue
this work by keeping IOCs up-to-date.
Having said that, the limitations of TinyCheck need to be understood. The tool should
be used with the following warning in mind: IOCs do not provide complete real-time
detection of all stalkerware apps like an IT Security solution does. Therefore, a result
detecting no stalkerware does not exclude the possibility that stalkerware has been
installed but not detected by TinyCheck.
In 2021, more NPOs in the field of domestic violence tested TinyCheck and provided
feedback to help improve the service. Police forces and judicial bodies in several
countries have also taken an interest in the tool to better support victims.

The State of Stalkerware in 2021

2021 has seen positive developments on
the regulatory and institutional fronts
Across the world, 2021 has seen some positive developments in the fight against
stalkerware from a regulatory and institutional point of view. In May 2021, the Diet, Japan’s
parliament, enacted a bill to amend their stalker regulation law. Under the revised law, in
addition to other stipulations, obtaining location information of people’s smartphones
through apps without their authorization is now illegal.
In August 2021, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States barred one app maker
from offering stalkerware. It was the first ban of its kind.
On August 17, 2021, the German Bundestag passed the “Act to Amend the Criminal
Code - More Effective Combating of Stalking and Better Coverage of Cyberstalking”
(translated from German). The new law entered into force on October 1, 2021, and now
includes cyberstalking in their catalog of offenses. The change is because of continued
technological progress and the associated increase in cyberstalking, particularly via
stalking apps or stalkerware. In addition, an important part of the new law is that it
classifies a case as serious if the offender “in the course of an offense, uses a computer
program whose purpose is the digital spying on other persons.”
The Council of Europe has been very active on this topic in 2021. In its first
recommendation on the “digital dimension” of violence against women, the Council of
Europe’s Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic
Violence (GREVIO) defines and outlines the problems of both gender-based violence
against women committed online and technology-enabled attacks against women, such
as legally obtainable tracking devices that enable perpetrators to stalk their victims.
This was shortly followed in December 2021 by a legislative initiative report on genderbased cyberviolence that was adopted by the European Parliament. The report calls
for (i) a common definition of gender-based cyberviolence and (ii) capacity building for
stakeholders. It highlights stalkerware among the key methods of cyberviolence and
“dismisses the notion that stalkerware applications can be considered parental control
applications”. Following the general recommendations of the Council of Europe, this

report, although non-binding, is another positive official document highlighting the
stalkerware issue and pushing European states to adapt their legislations and actions
to counter the issue. Finally, on March 8th, 2022, the European Commission published
a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating
violence against women and domestic violence. The document covers cyber violence
and dedicates two articles to cyber stalking (Art 8) and cyber harassment (Art 9) that it
proposes to criminalize.

Think you are a victim of stalkerware?
Here are a few tips
If you need help, reach out to a
local support organization. To
find one close to you, check the
Coalition Against Stalkerware
website

Whether or not you are a victim of stalkerware, here are a few tips if you want to better
protect yourself:
•

Protect your phone with a strong password that you never share with your partner,
friends or colleagues

•

Change passwords for all of your accounts periodically and don’t share them with
anyone

•

Only download apps from official sources, such as Google Play or the Apple App Store

•

Install a reliable IT security solution like Kaspersky Internet Security for Android on
devices and scan them regularly. However, in the case of potentially already installed
stalkerware, this should only be done after the risk to the victim has been assessed, as
the abuser may notice the use of a cybersecurity solution.

Victims of stalkerware may be victims of a larger cycle of abuse, including physical. In
some cases, the perpetrator is notified if their victim performs a device scan or removes
a stalkerware app. If this happens, it can lead to an escalation of the situation and further
aggression. This is why it is important to proceed with caution if you think you are being
targeted by stalkerware.
•

Reach out to a local support organization: to find one close to you, check the
Coalition Against Stalkerware website.

•

Keep an eye out for the following warning signs: these can include a fast-draining
battery due to unknown or suspicious apps using up its charge and newly-installed
applications with suspicious access to use and track your location, send or receive
text messages and other personal activities. Also check if your “unknown sources”
setting is enabled, it may be a sign that unwanted software has been installed from a
third party source. It is important to note that the above signs are only symptoms of
possible stalkerware installation, not a definitive indication.

•

Do not try to erase the stalkerware, change any settings or tamper with your
phone: this may alert your potential perpetrator and lead to an escalation of the
situation. You also risk erasing important data or evidence that could be used in a
prosecution.

The Coalition Against Stalkerware was founded
in November 2019 in response to the growing
threat of stalkerware. The Coalition seeks to
combine its partners’ expertise in domestic
violence survivor support and perpetrator work,
digital rights advocacy, and cybersecurity to
address the criminal behavior perpetrated by
stalkerware. All members commit to fighting
domestic violence, stalking, and harassment by
addressing the use of stalkerware and raising
public awareness about this issue.
