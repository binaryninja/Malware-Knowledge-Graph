EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Exploring the current global
trend of increasing threat actors’
sophistication, CyberInt researchers
have been tracking various activities
following the spear-phishing
campaign targeting large US-based
retailers detected in December 2018.
The research focused on scenarios
with the same tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTP) along with
the repeated nefarious use of a
‘legitimate’ remote administration
tool ‘Remote Manipulator System’
(RMS), developed by a Russianbased company ‘TektonIT’.

RECENT CAMPAIGNS
US RETAIL ATTACKS
In mid-December 2018 a spear-phishing campaign was detected as targeting large US-based retailers along
with organizations in the food and beverage industry. Masquerading as a legitimate communication sent
from a Ricoh printer, the initial email lured victims into opening an attached malicious Microsoft Word
document.
Lure Document/Downloader
Once opened, the lure document (Figure 1) encourages the victim to disable Microsoft Office’s security
features as well as including the target organization logo to appear authentic.

Figure 1 – Lure document

Once editing has been enabled within the document, a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro
is executed that will download an additional payload from the threat actor’s command and control
(C2) infrastructure, using the Microsoft Windows Installer (Figure 2).

Figure 2 – Payload download using MSIExec

The remote payload to install is specified by passing the URL to the ‘/i’ command line option whilst the
quiet ‘/q’ option ensures that the installation is performed in the background without displaying user
interface (UI) elements to the victim. Additionally, three variables are provided, ‘step’, ‘done’ and ‘change’
that, along with their corresponding values, would be passed to the installation package to influence or
modify the installation.
Presumably to thwart detection or casual analysis, the VBA macro code has some code obfuscation with
class and module attributes being used to store values (Figure 3) that are later referenced (Figure 4).

Figure 4 – Referencing the ‘Tag’ attribute

Potentially remaining from previous versions of this VBA macro, artefacts include code comments that
appear to be variable assignments referencing ‘Temp\scype0’, a potential file path and misspelling of ‘Skype’
(Figure 5), as well as a seemingly unreferenced IP logging service ‘hxxps://iplogger.org/6vfgP’ that provides
logs detail of any IP address accessing the URL (Figure 6).

Figure 5 – Code artefacts

The use of this IP logging service provides a
useful insight into those that have executed the
weaponised document with details of the visitor’s,
or more aptly victim’s, IP address, operating system,
browser and geolocation being available to the
threat actor through a statistics page accessible via
a specific link combined with their ‘IPLogger ID’.

For persistence, the second-stage shell script (line 2) adds a ‘Microtik’ string value to the ‘HKEY_

whenever the user logs on.

Additionally, the RMS executable is launched (line 3) before the script tries to forcefully kill the
‘rundll32.exe’ process, causing the script to go into a loop.
Finally, the RMS executable attempts to ‘call home’ with connection attempts being observed, at
the time, to ‘89.144.25.32’ on port ‘5655’, a C2 server located in Germany.

This behaviour is consistent with other TA505 campaigns utilising a combination of weaponised
Microsoft Office files containing either VBA macros or exploit code to spawn additional processes.
Of the spreadsheet lures analysed in this campaign, four different C2 servers and payloads were
identified, with each likely being unique to a specific target organization or victim cluster (Figure 19).

Figure 19 – Payload download using MSIExec

In addition to specifying the remote package to install, using the ‘/i’ command line option, the quiet ‘/q’
option ensures that the installation is performed in the background without displaying any user interface
(UI) elements to the victim. Additionally, variables are passed to the installation package with ‘OnLoad’ being
present in all cases along with either ‘serf’ and ‘done’ or ‘val’ and ‘rdp’. Whilst the nature of these variables
has not been determined, they may influence or modify the installation of the specified MSI file.

Note:

Whilst these registry keys are not in themselves an indicator of compromise
(IOC), attempts to access them in environments not using Delphi-developed
applications may be of interest.
Having created the file that resulted in the threat’s name, ‘%SYSTEMROOT%\
ServHelper.dll’, the process checks for the presence of the ‘Terminal Services’
service and changes the configuration, if necessary, to ensure that the service is
started automatically during system start-up (‘dwStartType=0x2’) (Figure 20).

Figure 20 – ‘Terminal Services’ service check

Subsequently, the Terminal Services service is started, presumably to allow remote access via RDP (Figure 21).

Figure 21 – 'Terminal Services' service started

Additional files are also created by the malicious process including ‘%SYSTEM32%\syssettings.ini’ and
‘%SYSTEM32%\termsrv32.dll’.
Communications between ServHelper and the command and control (C2) server include basic information
about the compromised host (Figure 22) and are sent using HTTP POST.

Figure 22 – ServHelper C2 Beacon

Remote Desktop Capabilities
Presumably as part of the process to ensure that the Terminal Services service is operational, the registry
key ‘HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TermService\Parameters’ is updated, or created, (Figure
23) and references the dropped ‘termsrv32.dll’ file rather than the default ‘termsrv.dll’ (Figure 24).

Having queried the status of multiple services, the ‘CryptSvc’, ‘Dnscache’, ‘LanmanWorkstation’, ‘NlaSvc’ and
‘TermService’ services are started, likely to enable the ServHelper remote capabilities.
Subsequently, to facilitate remote access, a new user ‘supportaccount’ is created, with a password of
‘Ghar4f5’, and added to both the ‘Remote Desktop Users’ and ‘Administrators’ groups (or the Russian
language equivalents) using the ‘net.exe’ command line utility (Figure 25).

Figure 25 – ‘supportaccount’ user creation/‘Remote Desktop Users’ & ‘Administrator’ group membership

Additionally, the username of the currently logged-in user is obtained from the environment variabnle and
also added to the ‘Remote Desktop Users’ group, again using ‘net.exe’ commands (Figure 26).

Subsequently, payloads are dropped and result in same malicious execution flow as observed in the USbased retail incident, including the RMS binary file, configuration shell scripts and victim specific content
including the RMS configuration file.

NOTARY CHAMBER OF UKRAINE
Also observed in December 2018, the same TTP, including ‘RMS’ being deployed, were used in an attack
against the Notary Chamber of Ukraine (Нотаріальна палата України).
In this instance, the initial email spear-phishing campaign mimicked the Shevchenkivsky District Court of
Kyiv (Шевченківський районний суд міста Києва) regarding a notary issue and encouraged the victim
to open the weaponised Microsoft Word document attachment (Figure 28).

Figure 28 – Lure email (Notary Chamber of Ukraine)

The document attachment,
appearing as badly scanned
documentation (Figure 29),
reportedly either contained
a VBA macro downloader, as
observed in the US-based retail
incident, or malicious binary
payloads used to ultimately
install the RMS tool.

Figure 29 – Lure Document

REMOTE MANIPULATOR
SYSTEM (RMS)
Remote Manipulator System (RMS) is a legitimate remote administration tool developed by a Russian
organization ‘TektonIT’ and has been observed in campaigns conducted by TA505 as well as numerous
smaller campaigns likely attributable to other, disparate, threat actors. In addition to the availability of
commercial licences, the tool is free for non-commercial use and supports the remote administration of
both Microsoft Windows and Android devices.

Figure 30 – TektonIT RMS (rmansys.ru/remoteutilities.com)

As to be expected when dealing with cybercriminals, ‘cracked’ versions of RMS also appear to be distributed
on underground forums and likely remove licencing restrictions.
Negating the need for a threat actor to develop their own tools, RMS features include remote control with
multi-monitor support, task manager, file transfer, command line interface, network mapping capabilities
and webcam/microphone access, all of which are common traits of a well-developed remote access
trojan (RAT). These features, coupled with the ability to install and operate the tool silently, make RMS an
attractive off-the-shelf solution for ‘abuse’ by both sophisticated and unsophisticated threat actors alike.

15

CyberInt Copyright © All Rights Reserved 2019

LEGIT REMOTE ADMIN TOOLS TURN INTO THREAT ACTORS’ TOOLS

In addition to RMS implementing its own remote desktop capabilities, which are compressed and encrypted,
the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is also supported and as such could facilitate the control of
‘ServHelper’ compromised devices.
Notably, whilst most malicious RATs would need to call home to the threat actor’s command and control
(C2) infrastructure, RMS includes an ‘Internet-ID’ feature which calls home to the developers’ servers and
sends a notification via email (Figure 31), further reducing attack complexity for less sophisticated threat
actors.

Figure 31 – Example ‘Internet-ID’ email

Within this notification email, the victim’s username and device name is provided along with the internetID and password required for remote administration.
Alternatively, and seemingly favour by more sophisticated threat actors such as TA505, a self-hosted
option is supported by RMS and allows them to configure their own ‘Remote Utilities’ (RU) Server. This RU
Server supports three roles that can be deployed individually or together, although only one, the ‘Relay
Server’, would likely be utilised in nefarious implementations. This Relay Server acts as an intermediary
with ‘compromised’ RMS clients calling-home to it and identifying themselves with their ‘Internet-ID’
facilitating communications that allow firewalls and NAT devices to be bypassed.
The additional roles, ‘Authorization Server’, supporting the management of access permissions, and
‘Sync Server’, synchronising address books, are likely only deployed in legitimate environments such as
corporate IT support teams.

BROADER USE OF RMS
Numerous Russian-language forum and social media posts, along with YouTube video tutorials, detail how
to package the legitimate RMS components for use in malicious campaigns and appear to date back to at
least 2011.
Threat actors such as TA505 have likely
evolved their use of RMS over time to the
point where they now package and deliver
the capable tool with their own malware;
a blend of proprietary threats with off-theshelf components combined with tried
and tested TTP.

Figure 32 – 2011 Forum thread discussing the hidden installation and use of RMS

That being said, the accessibility and simplicity of using RMS for nefarious purposes likely explains the
prevalence of the tool in unrelated malicious campaigns, many of which share similar TTP but differ in their
configuration and use of RMS.

RMS CONFIGURATION
Whilst the recent TA505 campaigns illustrate how a sophisticated threat actor may deliver the RMS tool,
along with other payloads, numerous tutorials, guides and tools are available on underground forums to
allow unsophisticated threat actors to conduct similar operations.
As if RMS didn’t already provide enough functionality that can be abused by threat actors, the ‘Viewer’
application includes a ‘MSI Configurator’ option that allows an installer package to be created. Having first
downloaded the latest RMS Host package from the legitimate website, the configurator wizard allows the
creation of three distribution types (Figure 33).

Figure 33 – RMS Host distribution types

17

CyberInt Copyright © All Rights Reserved 2019

LEGIT REMOTE ADMIN TOOLS TURN INTO THREAT ACTORS’ TOOLS

Once the distribution package type has been selected, the wizard allows the configuration of email
notifications (Figure 34) as well as supressing various options, dependant on the package type selected
(Figure 35).

Figure 34 – Internet-ID Configuration

Figure 35 – Other advanced options

Once the initial wizard has finished, a package is created and an additional ‘Remote Settings’ dialog is
displayed (Figure 36) allowing further configuration and customisation.
Notably within these settings is the ability to supress notifications and other
potentially victim-alerting features as well as configuring the network port and
preventing the future modification of settings without a password.
Once the package and configuration have been prepared, they can then be
delivered via various means to potential victims. In the case of TA505, this
involved a lure file acting as a downloader which delivered custom payloads
which ultimately silently install RMS. Less-sophisticated threat actors may choose
to follow an existing tutorial or obtain one of many builder tools available on
underground forums to further prepare their pre-configured RMS host which can
Figure 36 – ‘
Remote Settings’ dialog

then subsequently be delivered to victims via common methods such as phishing
emails or by masquerading as legitimate downloads.

CyberInt Copyright © All Rights Reserved 2019

LEGIT REMOTE ADMIN TOOLS TURN INTO THREAT ACTORS’ TOOLS

RMS BUILDERS
Early tutorials regarding the silent installation of RMS demonstrate the use of ‘AutoIT’, a legitimate
automation tool, that supresses user interactive elements of a preconfigured RMS installer, such as sending
a mouse click command to close the installation completion dialog (Figure 37).

Figure 37 – AutoIT Script

In this instance, the AutoIT script is compiled and compressed, along with a customised RMS installation
executable, in a self-extracting archive.
To further simplify the packaging process, numerous ‘builder’ tools (Figure 38) are available to generate
silent configurations and installers for the RMS host.
Whilst the features of these builder tools vary from tool to tool
(Figure 39), they typically include persistence capabilities, the
ability to mimic legitimate application or be bundled with another
file, file encryption and packing to evade antivirus solutions,
bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and, further demonstrating
that there is no honour among thieves, the removal of any other
RMS instance to eliminate potential competition.

RMS VIEWER
Having successfully built and deployed the nefariously configured RMS host components to victims,
the threat actor can remotely manage victim machines, with a simple right-click, using the RMS Viewer
application (Figure 40).

Figure 40 – Example Threat Actor use of RMS Viewer

Whilst functionality such as ‘Full control’ and ‘Chat’ will likely alert the victim to the activity, functions such
as the ‘File transfer’, ‘Terminal’ and ‘Remote install’ could facilitate the theft of data, information gathering
and the deployment of additional malicious payloads.

RMS CONFIGURATION XML
When installed, RMS appears to store its configuration as hexadecimal encoded XML data within the
Windows Registry (Figure 41).

Figure 41 – Example RMS Registry Configuration

20

CyberInt Copyright © All Rights Reserved 2019

LEGIT REMOTE ADMIN TOOLS TURN INTO THREAT ACTORS’ TOOLS

Whilst the registry location may differs between threat variants and versions, common locations include:
• HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TektonIT\
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Remote Manipulator System\
The presence of these registry keys, or similarly named values containing hexadecimal encoded RMS
configuration XML data, are likely indicators of compromise.
When obtained from a compromised machine, analysis of RMS configuration XML data can provide insight
into the RMS configuration as well as identifying the C2 server (Figure 42) or threat actor email address
(Figure 43).

Figure 42 – Example 'RMS Internet ID Settings' XML with C2 domain

Figure 43 – Example 'RMS INET ID Notification' XML with notification email address

RMS C2 COMMUNICATIONS
C2 communications between the RMS host and server have been observed as using a pre-defined useragent string ‘Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; RMS)’. In the absence of a configuration option for this string, it is likely
hardcoded and therefore communications identifying themselves as this user-agent are likely compromised.
C2 communications, via TCP, appear to transmit XML data with a structure similar to the RMS configuration
data with base-64 encoded elements (Figure 44).

Figure 44 – Example C2 communications (Red – victim; Blue – C2 server)

Decoding the above base-64 encoded value reveals another XML configuration file, providing an overview
of the RMS client to the C2 server (Figure 45).

Figure 45 - RMS host (victim) data sent to C2 Server

In the case of a RMS host configured
to call home to the legitimate servers,
resulting in a notification email to the
threat actor, a HTTP POST is used to send
the data comprised of email address,
additional text (as specified in the
configuration, and potentially providing
an indication of a tool being used),
victim user name, victim computer name,
Internet-ID, victim language and the
product name (Figure 46).
