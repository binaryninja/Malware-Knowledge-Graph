The Conti ransomware group —a.k.a. Wizard Spider; a.k.a. TrickBot; a.k.a Ryuk—is one of
the most prolific ransomware gangs around. It is believed to have been active, in various
incarnations, since about 2016. Just in the last year, Conti is believed to be responsible for
high profile attacks, including the city government in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Ireland's Health
Executive service in May, 2021.
Even as leading ransomware groups like REvil and Darkside have folded in recent months,
Conti is getting renewed attention from cybersecurity experts. The group, CISA warns, has
been linked to more than 1,000 attacks on U.S. and international organizations while “Conti
cyber threat actors remain active.”

2021: A ransomware extinction event?
The contrast is worth noting. In fact, 2020 and 2021 saw something like a mass extinction
event among high profile ransomware gangs and ransomware as a service outfits. There
was the digital takedown of infrastructure used by the REvil ransomware group, followed by
the arrests of REvil group members by Russian authorities in January, 2022. In May, 2021,
the Darkside ransomware group - which is believed to be responsible for the attack on the
Colonial Pipeline - said it was ceasing operations as well. That announcement coincided with
a coordinated law enforcement seizure of some of the group’s infrastructure and
cryptocurrency from the wallets of some Darkside affiliates. In November, BlackMatter,
another ransomware as a service group, said it was shutting down in the face of increased
scrutiny from law enforcement.

Conti thrives amid chaos

Despite this, Conti has been thriving. Why? In our latest episode of the ConversingLabs
Podcast I sat down with Yelisey Boguslavskiy, a co-founder of the threat intelligence firm
AdvIntel, to talk about Conti’s evolution in recent years, and why the group continues to be
such a potent threat.
According to Boguslavskiy, Conti’s continued vitality reflects a long-running practice of tightly
controlled and highly vertical business operations. That runs counter to the predominant
“ransomware as a service” model of “quantity over quality:" farming work out to pretty much
anyone interested in making a buck and counting on a small number of scores from a large
base of attacks. “This is something Conti never really followed in their methodology,”
Boguslavskiy said.
Conti’s operations have always been “rigid and organized,” by the standards of the criminal
ransomware underground. “It was run like a strict business unit,” he said. That meant doing a
lower volume of more targeted attacks, while keeping its network of business and technology
partners small.
“Conti established key business alliances with other cybercrime groups to remain
successful,” said Boguslavskiy. Rather than rely on others to provide tooling, Conti only uses
tools that they’ve developed or taken control of. “They don’t want to rely on others,” he said.

Ransomware: It’s strictly business
Coming into 2021, as most ransomware gangs were expanding operations, Conti took an
opposite path: ejecting non-core members and making the organization smaller and more
hierarchical. They also began rolling up key partners, like the group responsible for the
TrickBot and Emotet malware - long suppliers to Conti. “They’ve been very deliberate and
purposeful in their methodology,” Boguslavskiy told me. “It’s not a game. It’s a business.”
That strategy has proven to be decisive in keeping Conti operating in a new and more hostile
environment for ransomware groups, he said. The last six months has shown that
ransomware outfits that relied on large and diverse ecosystems of suppliers, infrastructure
partners and affiliates proved easy for governments and law enforcement to disrupt. That
fact was on display in May, when the Darkside group announced that it lost control of its
blog. payment server and CDN (content distribution network), as well as wallets containing
cryptocurrency ransoms paid by victims.

Conti: mind the R&D
One of the other key differentiators of Conti and ransomware as a service groups is the
group’s ongoing investments in research and development. Conti has consistently invested
back into its operations as a way to stay a step ahead of the competition (and law
enforcement). Right now, the group’s R&D is focused in areas like discovering new,
exploitable vulnerabilities and avenues for attack, Boguslavskiy said.

3/6

Among other things, Conti is looking for ways to leverage common and critical flaws like
Log4j, Petit Potam and a recent, critical vulnerability in SonicWall’s SonicOS. The group is
also working on enhancements to the Emotet botnet and engaging with other ransomware
groups, like those that developed the new BlackCat ransomware, to further its activities.

Know your adversary
The key for organizations concerned about ransomware is to not be complacent,
Boguslavskiy told me. Reports of the demise of ransomware groups, or dissent within Conti’s
ranks over business disputes or the War in Ukraine shouldn’t prompt organizations to let
down their guard. Conti remains very active and has shown itself to be extremely resilient.
“Even if they disappear they will come back stronger,” he said.
Understanding how Conti is working to compromise victims and how it behaves once it has a
foothold within organizations is the key to defending your organization, Boguslavskiy said.
These days, that means paying special attention to precursors of Conti, including indicators
of compromise linked to Emotet.

Questions? Talk to ReversingLabs
ReversingLabs continuously improves its detection mechanisms to keep up to date with
malware trends. That includes threats related to ransomware, wipers and other threats.
ReversingLabs' Titanium platform combines Explainable Machine Learning technology with
static analysis to reliably identify and extract wipers, malware and other indicators at scale.
That allows our customers to detect such threats in their environment quickly and before they
allow malicious actors to extend their reach within compromised networks.
Contact us if you’d like to learn more about how we help organizations combat threats like
malicious wipers and ransomware or to schedule a demonstration.
