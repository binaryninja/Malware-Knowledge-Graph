Amadey has updated its infection methods, and now employs SmokeLoader to get onto
victims’ systems. In past iterations, this information stealer has used exploit kits such as
RigEK and Fallout EK to gain access to vulnerable machines.
Amadey is a criminal-to-criminal (C2C) botnet infostealer project, meaning it is a service
made available on the black market by criminals, for purchase by other criminals. It was first
discovered in 2018, and highlighted by the BlackBerry Threat Research Team in 2020. While
it is primarily used for collecting information about a victim’s computing environment, it can
also be used to deliver additional malicious modules.
Recently, Amadey has been observed using SmokeLoader loader malware to spread a new
and highly aggressive Amadey Bot variant. Threat actors have concealed the loader in
“cracked” software and keygen (key generator) sites, which offer the lure of providing illicit
free access to licensed software. The SmokeLoader family has been actively relying on this
scheme for transmission since at least the beginning of this year.

Amadey Information Stealing Methods
1/4

After Amadey completes its initial setup processes, it connects to a remote, attackercontrolled command-and-control (C2) server. It then downloads a plugin to collect system,
application, and antivirus (AV) information from the victim’s machine. This information allows
the threat actor to identify both sensitive information for exfiltration as well as details of any
antivirus tools on the system, so they can be evaded.
This recent version of the infostealer includes enhanced features compared to its
predecessor. These include:
Scheduled tasks for persistence
Advanced reconnaissance options
User account control (UAC) bypassing
Tailored defense evasion strategies
After attackers have successfully breached a system, they then have the opportunity to
install additional malicious components.

Amadey and SmokeLoader Connection
The BlackBerry Threat Research Team has observed SmokeLoader being hidden in cracks
and keygens for several brands of popular software applications. The threat actor behind it
has been relying on black SEO to seed malicious results to get prime placement at the top of
search engine results, so those seeking cracks can easily find these Trojanized files to
download and run.
Since it’s publicly known that some AV vendors may block cracks and keygens, some people
explicitly disable their endpoint security products before downloading these files, or they
ignore detection alerts and proceed with the download. So even if the sample is widely
detected, there is room for a successful infection, due to the victim specifically allowing it.
SmokeLoader has been very active of late. According to telemetry monitored by BlackBerry,
most targets are in the United States, followed by Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. Over 25,000
different SmokeLoader samples have been observed in our telemetry during the past three
months.
It’s notable that a quarter of all attempts to infect have hit targets in the healthcare industry.

BlackBerry Stops SmokeLoader and Amadey
Customers using CylancePROTECT® are protected from SmokeLoader and Amadey
augmented by SmokeLoader.
To combat this highly effective and infectious malware variant, BlackBerry recommends
using artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on millions of both safe
and unsafe files. For example, BlackBerry’s Cylance® AI uses automated security agents to
block Amadey based on numerous file attributes and malicious behaviors, rather than relying
on a specific file signature.

About CylancePROTECT
CylancePROTECT is an endpoint protection platform (EPP) from BlackBerry that employs
Cylance AI’s advanced, seventh-generation, machine learning models to provide a predictive
advantage against both zero-day threats and legacy cyberattacks.
