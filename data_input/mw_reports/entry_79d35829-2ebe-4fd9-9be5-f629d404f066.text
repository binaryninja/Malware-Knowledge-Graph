HelloKitty Ransomware Lacks Stealth, But Still Strikes

Game studio CD Projekt Red recently disclosed that it became a victim of a targeted, highlyimpactful ransomware. In the days following the disclosure, it was revealed that the
ransomware family most likely behind the attack was “HelloKitty”.

1/8

HelloKitty is a ransomware family that emerged in late 2020. While it lacks the sophistication
of some of the more well-known families such as Ryuk, REvil, and Conti, it has nevertheless
struck some notable targets, including CEMIG0. In this post, we analyse a recent HelloKitty
sample and outline the basic behaviors and traits associated with this family of ransomware.

Execution and Behavior
The “HelloKitty” name is based on internal mutex names, which are apparent upon
execution.

While still somewhat unclear, current intelligence indicates that the primary delivery method
of HelloKitty binaries is via phish email or via secondary infection in conjunction with other
malware.
Once launched, HelloKitty will attempt to disable and terminate a number of processes and
services so as to reduce interference with the encryption process. This includes processes
and services associated with IIS, MSSQL, Quickbooks, Sharepoint, and more. These actions
are carried out via taskkill.exe and net.exe .
In the analyzed sample, this is all done in a very non-stealthy manner. All spawned CMD
windows are in the foreground and fully visible. This ‘lack of discreteness’ is atypical for
modern ransomware, or any successful malware, for that matter.

Additional processes and services that are terminated are identified via PID. For example:
taskkill.exe /f /PID "8512"
taskkill.exe /f /PID "8656"

If HelloKitty is unable to stop any specific processes or services, it will leverage the Windows
Restart Manager API to further assist in termination.

HelloKitty will also utilize WMI to gather system details and help identify running processes
and any potentially problematic processes. This is done both by name and by PID. A number
of examples are shown below:

start iwbemservices::exe

Encryption and Ransom Note
Encryption is initiated and completed very quickly once applicable services and processes
have been terminated. Specific encryption recipes and routines can vary across variants of
HelloKitty. Generally speaking, they tend to use a combination of AES-256 & RSA-2048 or
even NTRU+AES-128.
Once encrypted, affected files receive the .crypted extension.

Ransom notes are typically customized to directly reference the victim and victim’s
environment. Victims are instructed to visit a TOR-based payment and support portal. The
following example has been sanitized:

It is also important to note that as of this writing, the onion address associated with HelloKitty
ransom notes is not active.

Conclusion
HelloKitty may be easier to spot than other modern ransomware families, but upon execution
it is no less dangerous. There are currently no known ‘weaknesses’ in the encryption
routines, and there are no thirdy-party decrypters available for the HelloKitty ransomware.

Therefore, the only true defense is prevention. While this family does not appear to be
actively leaking victim data at the moment, that could change at any point, in addition to them
choosing to adopt some of the more recent extortion methods that go along with ransomware
(DDoS).
Actors behind the more recent campaign(s) are reportedly attempting to auction the CD
Projekt data off in various ‘underground’ forums. At present this sale of this data does appear
to be legitimate. Time will tell if additional victim data is dealt with in the same way.
To protect yourself against HelloKitty, make sure you are armed with a modern Endpoint
Security platform, which is configured correctly and up to date. The SentinelOne Singularity
Platform is fully capable of preventing and detecting all malicious behaviors associated with
the HelloKitty ransomware family.
