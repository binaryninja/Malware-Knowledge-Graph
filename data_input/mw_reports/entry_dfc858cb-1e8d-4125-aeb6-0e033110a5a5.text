After almost two years of sporadic restricted activity, the ShadowGate campaign has started delivering
cryptocurrency miners with a newly upgraded version of the Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit. The campaign
has been spotted targeting global victims, after operating mainly in Asia.

ShadowGate Returns to Worldwide Operations With Evolved Greenﬂash Sundown Exploit Kit - TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog

The ShadowGate (also called WordsJS) campaign was identiﬁed in 2015. It delivered malware with exploit
kits through the compromised ad servers of Revive/OpenX advertising software. After a takedown operation
on September 2016, the campaign tried to hide their activities.
However, that same year they also developed their own exploit kit, which we named Greenﬂash Sundown,
likely to avoid using exploit kit services from the underground market. At the end of 2016, the campaign
stopped their injection attacks on the compromised ad servers and restricted their activity to spreading
ransomware via compromised South Korean websites. In April 2018, ShadowGate was spotted spreading
cryptocurrency miners with Greenﬂash Sundown. However, the injection was limited to servers in East Asian
countries and soon stopped.
After a period of relatively restrained activities, we noticed ShadowGate attacking through ad servers again
this June. However, these attacks were not just targeting regional victims but global ones. Visitors to websites
embedded with malicious advertisements (from the compromised ad servers) were redirected to the
Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit and infected with a Monero cryptocurrency miner. This is the most notable
activity we have seen from this group since 2016. Despite their low proﬁle over the past couple of years, it
seems that they have been continuously developing and evolving their exploit kit.
Below is a report on how the Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit has changed since we discovered it in 2016,
including details of their latest activity.
Greenﬂash Sundown reﬁned evasion and targeting techniques
ShadowGate is invested in the continuous development of their exploit kit. In 2018, Greenﬂash Sundown was
spotted integrating the Flash exploit for CVE-2018-4878 prior to other exploit kits. Greenﬂash Sundown was
then identiﬁed using another Flash exploit for CVE-2018-15982 this April. The continuous updates of the kit
to include new exploits allows it to maintain its infection rate.

from June 7, 2019 to June 24, 2019)
During the latest attack of ShadowGate that started this June, we found that they had another version of the
Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit with two updates.

version 31.0.0.153) (bottom)
The ﬁrst change involves the integration of a public key encryption algorithm to protect their exploit kit
payload. Last November, we saw that this exploit kit used the same encryption technique to protect their
malware payload during the last infection stage. However, this time they used the encryption from the ﬁrst
few communications to encrypt all of their trafﬁc during infection.

The encryption technique is as follows: ﬁrst, the victim generates a random number called a nonce to produce
a unique secret key during each attack. The secret key will be encrypted by a public key and then securely
sent to the exploit kit. The exploit kit — using a private key — can recover the secret key and use it to
encrypt the malicious payload that will be delivered with the RC4 algorithm (a cipher algorithm requiring a
shared key for decryption). The payload will then be sent to the victim, who will decrypt it with the secret
keys.
This encryption technique is supposed to prevent security solutions from detecting their malicious payload as
it is transferred to the victim. In theory, because the secret key only exists in memory and is not supposed to
be transferred directly in plaintext, it is difﬁcult for a threat analyst to ﬁnd the secret key and decrypt the
malicious payload.
The use of public key encryption algorithm was also seen in the exploit kit Underminer, which we discovered
last year. However, we found that the hackers behind the Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit made a mistake
with their encryption. They used the generated nonce not only for generating the secret key but also as a key
of RC4 to encrypt victim’s WebGL information before sending it to exploit kit server. The generated nonce
was actually sent in plaintext during their communication, which makes it accessible and readable. With the
nonce, it becomes possible to reproduce the secret key and decrypt the malicious payload ofﬂine.

The latest version of the Greenﬂash Sundown exploit kit also features an updated PowerShell loader. Since
November 2018, we noticed the exploit kit started to use a PowerShell loader, which makes it capable of
ﬁleless malware infection. The upgraded loader in this new version is now capable of collecting a proﬁle of
the victim’s environment and sending the information to the exploit kit server.
This allows its operators to be more precise in their targeting. If the victim’s proﬁle ﬁts their speciﬁcations,
the malware will deliver its payload. Otherwise, the server will return an empty response. The upgrade also
helps them avoid sandboxes or honeypots that can capture their malware. The information taken from the
victim includes OS details, user name, video card, hard disk information, and antivirus products.

Cybercriminals are continuously updating their exploit tools and techniques to evade detection and ﬁnd better
targets. These criminals sometimes spend years reﬁning their attacks, as seen with Greenﬂash Sundown. To
stay ahead of the curve, users should always keep their systems and applications updated to the latest version.
The vulnerabilities targeted by these exploit kits usually have available ﬁxes, so applying a solid patching and
update strategy mitigates much of the risk. To further strengthen security, enterprises are also advised to
enable a multilayered protection system that can actively block threats and malicious URLs from the gateway
to the endpoint.
A proactive, multilayered approach to security is key against threats that exploit vulnerabilities. Trend Micro
Deep Security and Trend Micro™ Vulnerability Protection also provide virtual patching that protects servers
and endpoints from threats that abuse vulnerabilities in critical applications or websites.
Trend Micro customers are protected by the following Deep Security rule:
1009405-Adobe Flash Player Use After Free Vulnerability (CVE-2018-15982)
Trend Micro™ OfﬁceScan™ with XGen™ endpoint security has Vulnerability Protection that shields
endpoints from identiﬁed and unknown vulnerability exploits even before patches are even deployed. Trend
Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security protect end users and businesses from
these threats by detecting and blocking malicious ﬁles and all related malicious URLs.

defenders can keep up with the broad range of threats.
Read our security predictions for 2020.

Business Process Compromise

Attackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target speciﬁc processes enterprises rely on.
They scout for vulnerable practices, susceptible systems and operational loopholes that they can
leverage or abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101: Business Process Compromise.
