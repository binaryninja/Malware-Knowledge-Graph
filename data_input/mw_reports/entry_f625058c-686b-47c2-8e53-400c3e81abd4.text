Over the last few years, we have been monitoring a cyber-espionage campaign that has
successfully compromised more than 350 high profile victims in 40 countries. The main tool
used by the threat actors during these attacks is NetTraveler, a malicious program used for
covert computer surveillance.
The name NetTraveler comes from an internal string which is present in early versions of the
malware: NetTraveler Is Running! This malware is used by APT actors for basic surveillance
of their victims. Earliest known samples have a timestamp of 2005, although references exist
indicating activity as early as 2004. The largest number of samples we observed were
created between 2010 and 2013.

Key findings on the NetTraveler attacks:
The highest number of infections was located in Mongolia, followed by India and
Russia. In total, infections were identified in 40 countries including Kazakhstan,

Canada, the United Kingdom, Chile, Morocco, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Ukraine,
Lithuania, Belarus, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan,
Thailand, Qatar, and Jordan.
The group has infected victims across multiple industries including government
institutions, embassies, oil and gas industry, research institutes, military contractors
and activists.
Most recently, the NetTraveler groups main domains of interest for cyber-espionage
activities include space exploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power,
lasers, medicine and communications.
During our research, we identified six victims that had been infected by both
NetTraveler and Red October.

Kaspersky Labs products detect and neutralize the malicious programs and its variants
used by the NetTraveler Toolkit, including Trojan-Spy.Win32.TravNet and
Downloader.Win32.NetTraveler. Kaspersky Labs products detect the three Microsoft
Office exploits used in the spear-phishing attacks, including Exploit.MSWord.CVE2010-3333, Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.
Based on collected intelligence, we estimate the group size to about 50 individuals, most of
which speak Chinese natively and have working knowledge of the English language
NetTraveler is designed to steal sensitive data as well as log keystrokes, and retrieve file
system listings and various Office or PDF documents.
