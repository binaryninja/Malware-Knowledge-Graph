1. Summary of the event
In February 2022 , the mobile security team of Qi'anxin Virus Response Center noticed that since June 2021 , an A _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ P& T organization mainly targets PakistanThe Tanzanian military has launched organized , planned and targeted
military espionage intelligence activities . _ After just nine months of attacks , the group has affected dozens of Pakistani military
personnel . _ This part of the victimThe personnel are mainly Pakistani national border guards ( FC ) and special forces ( SSG ) ,
especially the Balochistan border guards ( FCBLN ) ; in addition _ _ _ _ Also contains a small amount of FBI ( FIA ) and police (
Police ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Another attack also affected a small number of Nepalese personnel , but domestic users in China were not
affected by it .

Figure 1.1 Distribution of affected countries _ _ _ _ _

The organization usually uses public social platforms to find the target of concern , and combines pornographic words and other chats
to induce the target users to install the specified bait chat attack application . Used for phishing attacks . Furthermore ,The attacker
also published the malicious chat application on a well- known foreign app store platform , but the relevant links are now inaccessible
.
As of the time of this report , all the attacks of this group that we have intercepted are carried out through the An d r oi d platform ,
and we have not found any Via the Windows platform _ _ _ _ _attack . _ _ A total of 8 malicious application download servers have
been captured , and at least 5 different Android platform attack samples can be downloaded on the servers . _ _ All samples were _
_Dedicated chat software for Italian codes . We name all these captured malicious samples V a j r a Sp y . _ _ _ _
Comprehensive analysis of the attack activity characteristics , sample coding method , C2 server architecture and other clues shows
that the organization has a regional power in South Asia . the background of the government , but also live with the regionOther APT
tissues that jumped , such as Sidewinder Sidewinder , Manling Flower Bitter , Belly Brainworm Donot , etc. , were not significantly
associated _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( Only with bellyworm D o no o t _ _There is a small amount of similarity ) , with
strong independence and independent characteristics . Therefore , we identified this organization as a new APT organization active in
South Asia . _ _ We named it King Kong Elephant , English _The document name is V a j r a E l e ph , and the organization number is
A P T - Q - 4 3 . King Kong Elephant is the 15th APT organization that Qi Anxin independently discovered and first disclosed . _ _ _
2. Load delivery _
Through the Qi Anxin Virus Response Center mobile security team and the Qi Anxin threat intelligence platform ( h t t p s : / / t i . q i
a n x i n . c o m / ) joint tracking analysis found that , the earliest activities of the King Kong Elephant Organization can be traced back
to June 2021 . The picture below shows the earliest payload server information of the organization that we intercepted .

In the early attacks of this group , the " short link " of the download address of the attack payload is usually sent to the target through
social software such as WhatsApp . . Later , with the major socialTaiwan banned related links , and the organization switched to
delivering short links to target people in the form of pictures .

1 ) The purpose of the attack
Attackers targeted Pakistani military , security and police personnel , including border guards ( FC ) , special forces ( SSG ) , federal
investigators _ _ _ _ _ _ Bureau ( FIA ) and Police ( P _ _o l ic e ) and so on . Among them , the border guards are the main target .

8/11

There are also a small number of activities targeting Nepalese military personnel . It can be seen from this that military personnel and
military secrets are thethe main purpose of the activity .
2 ) Attack method
Attackers are good at using social induced delivery and SMS induced delivery to attack , among which social induced delivery is the
main method .
3 ) Network assets
The mobile phone numbers used by the attackers are all exclusive numbers of mobile service providers in a country in South Asia .
4 ) Native language features
The attackers used a large number of languages from a South Asian country in their attacks . The country has a longstanding military
and geopolitical conflict with Pakistan . _ _
5 ) Association with other APT organizations _ _ _
The activity characteristics of the malicious sample download server are similar to those of the belly worm ( Donot ) . _ _ _
Some of the filenames used in the attack have certain similarities to the bellyworm tissue . _ _
To sum up , the King Kong Elephant Organization should be a senior executive with a government background in a South Asian
country who mainly launched cyber attacks against Pakistani military personnel and military activities . attack group , is an active
_New APT organization in South Asia . _ _ _

6. Summary and Recommendations _
In traditional APT activities , the use of mobile social platforms is not common . _ _ This is because most of the sensitive and
confidential information is stored on the computer , and on the other hand , it is also caused byBecause of launching attacks through
social platforms , it is easy to leave traces .
However , in the past two years , with the increasing popularity of mobile social platforms , we have found that many A P T activities
targeting developing countries will be more or less Via mobile platforms , social platformsto proceed . For example , the Nuo Chong
Lion Organization , the Blade Eagle Organization and the Diamond Elephant Organization disclosed this time all target the An d r oi d
platform and _ _ _ _ _ network of social platformsattack activity . The analysis believes that the reasons for the increasing attention
of APT activities on mobile platforms and social platforms mainly include the following aspects :
First of all, the level of network security construction and management in many developing countries is relatively backward , so that it
is possible to gain access to smartphones only through attacks on smartphones . large amounts of sensitive and confidential
information.
Second , the popularity of smartphones is getting higher and higher . It is a low-cost , high -cost way to launch cyber attacks through
social platforms against secret -related personnel with insufficient security awareness . Efficient attack . _ _
Third , smartphones often have more unfixed security vulnerabilities , and the penetration rate of mobile security software is not high
, which leads to the launch of network targeting mobile platforms . The technical threshold of attack is relatively lower.
Then , for government and enterprise institutions , especially the military , police and other secret or sensitive institutions , how
should they do a good job in protection , and try to avoid or reduce the targeting of immigrants as much as possible ? App for mobile
platforms and social platforms _What is the impact of T activities on yourself ? Here we give some practical suggestions as follows .
1 ) Work and life are separated , and sensitive information is not shared
Agencies should strive to avoid staff using personal smartphones for routine office activities . _ _ Conditional units can distribute
work mobile phones or confidential mobile phones to staff . _ _ If the conditions are trueIt is not allowed . You can use enterprise level secure mobile work platforms for internal communication and office work , such as Lanxin and cloud mobile phone security
management systems .
2 ) Strengthen safety awareness education and strictly implement safety regulations
Relevant institutions should strengthen employee security awareness education , do not use personal mobile phones to shoot , store
sensitive or confidential information , and do not share sensitive or confidential information through social platforms information ;
don’t click on strangers’ postsUnknown links come ; reject the temptation of illegal information such as pornography and gambling .
At the same time , relevant agencies should also formulate practical cybersecurity management standards and employee code of
conduct , and carry out strictSupervision and review .
3 ) Update software system , use security software
Relevant institutions should require employees , whether it is an office mobile phone or a personal mobile phone , to update the
operating system and core software in a timely manner to ensure that the smart phone starts to work . Always in the best safe
condition . sameInstall the necessary mobile phone security software at any time to reduce the damage of various Trojan horses and
viruses as much as possible .
4 ) Establish threat intelligence capabilities to prevent APT attacks _ _

9/11

Relevant institutions should work with professional security vendors to build efficient threat information collection , analysis and
disposal capabilities , and timely detect , intercept and track various APT activities . _ move , bring APT activities to the _ _Impact
and losses are minimized .
At present , a full line of products based on Qi'anxin 's self - developed Owl engine and Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence Center 's threat
intelligence data , including Qi'anxin 's threat intelligence platform ( TIP ) , Tianqing , Tianji _ _ _, Sky Eye Advanced Threat
Detection System , Qi An Xin N G SOC , Qi An Xin Situational Awareness , etc. , have all supported the accurate detection of such
attacks .
