Ransomware

HermeticRansom cryptor was used as a distraction to support HermeticWiper attacks.

Our researchers analyzed the HermeticRansom malware also known as Elections
GoRansom. By and large, this is a fairly simple cryptor. What is interesting in this case is the
purpose for which attackers are using it.

HermeticRansom goals

1/3

HermeticRansom attacked computers at the same time as another malware known as
HermeticWiper, and based on publicly available information from security community, it was
used in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. According to our experts, the relative simplicity and
questionable malware workflow implementation suggests that HermeticRansom was used as
a smokescreen for HermeticWiper attacks.

What HermeticRansom is capable of
Once infecting the victim’s computer, the malware first identifies hard drives and collects a
list of directories and files located everywhere except for the Windows and Program Files
folders. It then encrypts certain categories of files and renames them adding а .encrypted tag
and the email address of the ransomware operators. The malware also creates a
read_me.html file in the Desktop folder containing a ransom note with the attackers’
contacts. The note looks like this:

Ransom note left by HermeticRansom malware

HermeticRansom encrypts files with following extensions: .inf, .acl, .avi, .bat, .bmp, .cab, .cfg,
.chm, .cmd, .com, .crt, .css, .dat, .dip, .dll, .doc, .dot, .exe, .gif, .htm, .ico, .iso, .jpg, .mp3,
.msi and odt.

HermeticRansom peculiarities
HermeticRansom is written in Golang. It does not use any obfuscation mechanisms, and the
encryption method itself is rather cumbersome and inefficient. Judging by these and some
other signs, our experts think that this malware was created in a hurry.

compromise on our Securelist blog.
