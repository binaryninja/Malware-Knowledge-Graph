X-Ray of Malware Evasion Techniques: Analysis,
Dissection, Cure?
speakerdeck.com/fr0gger/x-ray-of-malware-evasion-techniques-analysis-dissection-cure

This presentation has been presented at Bsides Sydney (https://bsidessydney.org/)
Malware evasion consists of techniques used by malware to bypass security in place,
circumvent automated and static analysis as well as avoiding detection and harden reverse
engineering. There is a broad specter of techniques that can be used. In this talk we will
review the history of malware evasion techniques, understand the latest trends currently
used by threat actors and bolster your security analysis skills by getting more knowledge
about evasion mechanisms.

4. What are Evasion Techniques? Practical examples and current trends

How
can you step up on that topic? The power of information sharing

5. All the techniques used by a a software to avoid
static, dynamic, automatic and human analysis in order to understand its behavior All
the techniques used by malware to avoid and evade security solutions, security
configuration as well as human detection to perform malicious action the longer on the
infected computer.
6. In Mitre ATT&CK, the Defense Evasion section is the most
dominant tactic For attackers, the longer the malware remains undetected the longer
they can perform actions For defenders, the sooner the malware is detected the less
damage it will cause
