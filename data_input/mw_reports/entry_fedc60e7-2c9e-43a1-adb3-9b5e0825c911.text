May 15, 2019 Axel F and the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team
Update: Table 1 was updated to reflect a Poland-targeted Emotet campaign discovered on
the day of publication. This is the first campaign targeting the region since 2017.

Overview
Proofpoint researchers began tracking a prolific actor (referred to as TA542) in 2014 when
reports first emerged about the appearance of the group’s signature payload, Emotet (aka
Geodo) [1][2]. TA542 consistently uses the latest version of this malware, launching
widespread email campaigns on an international scale that affect North America, Central
America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
Earlier versions of Emotet had a module that was used to commit banking fraud, specifically
targeting German, Austrian, and Swiss banks [7], and for years, the malware was widely
classified as a banking Trojan. However, later versions of Emotet no longer loaded its own
banking module, and instead loaded third party banking malware. More recently, we have
observed Emotet delivering third-party payloads such as Qbot, The Trick, IcedID, and
Gootkit. Additionally, Emotet loads its modules for spamming, credential stealing, email
harvesting, and spreading on local networks.
TA542 typically distributes high volume email campaigns consisting of hundreds of
thousands or even millions of messages targeting all industries. TA542 is currently one of the
most prolific actors in the entire threat landscape. With TA542’s international reach and high
volume campaign strategy, we expect Emotet use to continue to grow in the upcoming
quarters.

Evolution of Emotet
Version 1 of Emotet originated around May 2014 as a banking Trojan, which at first was only
known to load its own banking module targeting German and Austrian banks [1][2].
Version 2 was detected in fall 2014, when it began using the Automatic Transfer System
(ATS), and had a modular structure with a spamming module, banking module, DDoS
module, and address book stealing module [7].
Version 3 of Emotet appeared in January of 2015, containing stealth modifications designed
to prevent its detection by anti-malware defenses, and soon began targeting Swiss banks [7].
Version 4 was initially observed around December 1, 2016, spreading via the RIG 4.0 exploit
kit [9]. Proofpoint researchers next observed it spreading via emails with links to zipped
executables or JScript in February 2017. Starting in April 2017, TA542 began consistently
distributing this version in high-volume campaigns. This version does not use its own
banking module, but primarily loads other modules and third-party banking malware.

Emotet Modules
Since its introduction, Emotet has used a number of modules:
Main module: Downloads other modules from a command and control (C&C) server.
Spam module: This module has been present in most versions of Emotet. The spam module
facilitates the continued spread of the Emotet botnet by sending out emails with links or
attachments that lead to Emotet. “Distribution is performed using previously scraped mail
accounts, which are sent to each spambot” from the C&C [8].
Credential stealing: This module has been present in most versions of Emotet. In version 4, it
steals credentials from web browsers and mail clients, using NirSoft tools Mail PassView and
WebBrowser PassView [8].
Spreader module: The network spreader module, introduced in September 2017,
enumerates network resources. It attempts to connect to them “as the currently logged on
user before jumping into the bruting portion of the code.” [10] The brute force attack happens
by enumerating available logins and attempting passwords from a hardcoded list. For every
successful login, a file is copied into the new network folder. A service is configured on the
remote system to execute the file.
Email harvesting: This module was introduced in October 2018. It exfiltrates email content
from the infected machines to the C&C. Specifically targeted components of email include
the email subject, body, the name of the sender and the receiver, along with his or her
corresponding email address. This information is only stolen for emails sent/received in the
last 180 days. “If the body is longer than 16384 characters, it is truncated to this size plus the
string ...” [6].

5/14

Address book stealer: This module, first seen in 2017, performs a relationship analysis
between sender and recipient in the current user’s Outlook data file. It extracts the name and
address list from each profile’s address book and then undergoes a recursive scan on each
email stored in the data file. Information about each sender and recipient is extracted, which
is then used to make inferences about the relationship and refine its targeting, that is then
passed to the spam module. [11]
DDoS module: No longer active, a module from early versions of Emotet [7].
Banking module: No longer active, a module from early versions of Emotet [7].

Delivery
As with many threat actors monitored by Proofpoint researchers, TA542 leverages social
engineering mechanisms to increase infection rates. They frequently use stolen branding
and urgent subject lines in order to deceive potential victims. They also compose emails in
the appropriate language for the targeted country. TA542 uses a variety of social engineering
mechanisms and strategies, but the most common are described below.
Email Subjects
TA542 primarily uses generic subject lines that usually refer to transactions, payments, and
invoices. Examples include: “ACH Payment Info”, “Payment Notification”, “Transaction for
your invoice”, “Overdue payment”, “Paid Invoices”, “Sales Invoice”, “Status update”,
“Document needed”, “New Order”, “Receipt for your invoice”.
Email Body
Often, the body of the message is simple, and consists of only a few sentences. Email
bodies usually include brief verbiage about missed or upcoming payments, incoming
financial statements, or invoices. However, Proofpoint researchers have observed more
sophisticated examples in which TA542 included stolen company branding.
Email Thread Hijacking
Thread hijacking is a technique in which threat actors reply to existing benign email
conversations with a malicious attachment or URL. Since early April 2019, TA542 began to
consistently utilize this technique to distribute Emotet, sending what appear to be replies to
legitimate emails [4][5]. While the technique is not novel or original, it is still effective because
as victims have seen these email chains before, they may believe that they are interacting
with a person they trust, making them more inclined to open attachments and links in the
message body.
The appearance of thread hijacking followed reports of a new module that can steal emails
from the victim’s machines in October 2018 [5].

Brand Abuse
TA542 abuses the branding of dozens of high-profile companies, including them in the body
of the email, Microsoft Word document attachments, PDF attachments, and in the malicious
URL paths. Commonly abused brands include shipping companies (such as DHL and UPS),
telecommunication companies (such as T-Mobile and O2), large financial institutions (such
as TD Bank, Barclays, and RBC) and others.
Holiday Lures
TA542 also drafts holiday-themed lures to target consumers during major holidays.
Proofpoint researchers have observed seasonal upticks in TA542 Emotet activity, especially
around Christmas, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, likely targeting holiday
shoppers.
Geographical targeting
TA542 frequently targets certain core geographies such as Germany, United Kingdom,
United States, and Latin America. TA542 also targets other countries, but less consistently.
Each region is targeted with appropriate language translations in email bodies, subjects,
filenames, and geographically relevant branding. Known targeted countries are listed in

Example Emails
This section highlights email lures from some of the more notable TA542 campaigns.
The figure below shows the following email messages:
German language email targeting Switzerland containing a malicious URL on April 29,
2019 (top left).
English language email targeting the United States and utilizing thread hijacking on
April 30, 2019 (top right).
Chinese language email targeting Taiwan on April 12, 2019. This email is notable
because, for a few days in April, TA542 experimented with targeting this region as well
as China, Hong Kong, and Australia (bottom left).
Spanish language email targeting a company in the Dominican Republic on May 3,
2019. This particular email is notable because, while Latin American countries are
frequently targeted, the neighboring Caribbean countries are rarely targeted (bottom
right).

Attachments / URLs
The malicious content included in the emails sent by this threat actor is generally either a
URL or an attachment, although Proofpoint researchers have observed some instances in
which both were included at the same time. The actor maintains a diverse arsenal of
attachments and URLs in order to vary their attacks. TA542 frequently uses some formats,
such as attached Microsoft Word documents with macros and URLs linking to similar
documents. The actor uses other formats such as PDFs and JScript intermittently. Finally,
formats such as password-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word documents appear
to be experimental and it remains to be seen if they will be adopted for broader use.
Attachments
The following is a list of known types of email attachments used by TA542. All types of
attachments are first-stage downloaders that attempt to download the Emotet payload or
another intermediary downloader, as in the case of PDFs, from one of several (typically five)
hardcoded payload URLs. Many unique attachments can contain the same set of payload
URLs. TA542 also exchanges the URL sets several times a day.
Microsoft Word documents with macros
PDFs with links to Microsoft Word documents with macros
PDFs with links to Zip archives with JScript files inside
Password-protected Zip archives with JScript files inside

Password-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word documents
URLs
The following is a list of known types of URLs that the actor embeds in the emails. The URLs
are frequently hosted on compromised vulnerable sites, including vulnerable WordPress
installations. The actor typically adds a nested structure of one or more folders on the
compromised site and hosts a malicious PHP script that initiates the download of the
payload. The folder names are sometimes synchronized with the rest of the campaign
theme, and might use stolen branding.
URLs linking to Microsoft Word documents with macros
URLs linking to Zipped Microsoft Word documents with macros
URLs linking to Jscript
URLs linking to Zipped JScript
URLs linking to Zipped executables (not used since 2017)
Experiments
April 3, 2019: First use of password-protected Zip files containing JScript. The actor
has intermittently used this technique several more times.
April 4, 2019: First use of password-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word
documents. At the time of writing of this analysis, the actor has only used this method
once.

Conclusion
In the last two years, TA542 has become one of the most prolific threat actors in the overall
threat landscape. Leveraging a robust Botnet known as Emotet, TA542 orchestrates highvolume, international email campaigns that distribute hundreds of thousands or even millions
of messages per day. They use Emotet to download third-party banking malware such as
The Trick, IcedID, and Gootkit, and to facilitate the continued spread of their botnet via a
number of modules. As TA542 continues to operate at near-global scale, we can expect
Emotet use to grow in the upcoming quarters.
