A Cobalt Strike Cybercrime Syndicate and the Ransomware Hackers’ Favorite Weapon
On March 9, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the U.S.
Secret Service issued an updated alert about the Conti ransomware group, encouraging
organizations to review their advisory and apply the recommended mitigations. They stated:
“Conti cyberthreat actors remain active and Conti ransomware attacks against U.S. and
international organizations have risen to more than 1,000. Notable attack vectors include
Trickbot and Cobalt Strike.”
eSentire’s Threat Response Unit security research team (TRU) has been tracking the
movements of the Conti gang for over two years. TRU issued a new report on the Conti
Gang on March 7, 2022, two days prior to the CISA alert, where it warned its customers and
critical infrastructure organizations that the Conti gang was continuing to launch attacks
against oil terminals, pharmaceutical companies, food manufacturers, IT services providers,
etc. Conti declared its allegiance to Russia immediately following Russia’s invasion into
Ukraine.

TRU is publishing a new set of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are currently being
used by a Conti affiliate, and eSentire is encouraging security defenders to also use these to
detect any possible Conti activity in their networks. These IOCs all link back to the Cobalt
Strike infrastructure.
Every week for the past three years, the public has heard countless news reports of
businesses and public entities being compromised by ransomware. However, in these
incidents, it is usually the ransomware groups behind the attacks that grab the headlines.
TRU contends that it is not just the ransomware gangs that are causing the scourge, it is also
those cybercriminals who are supplying the malware, the infrastructure and the tools. For
some time, what appears to be their favorite weapon is Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike has
repeatedly enabled ransomware threat actors to disrupt critical healthcare services,
municipalities, educational institutions, energy companies, and international meat suppliers.
For the past year and half, Cobalt Strike (a threat emulation software used for adversary
simulations and Red Teams) has been observed being used by the top ransomware gangs
and financial cybercrime groups. Cobalt Strike is an organized, methodical and multifunctional software that is being used, unfortunately, in conjunction with ransomware to
disrupt critical systems. It is readily delivered by numerous initial access vectors and
provides a variety of tools that help threat actors navigate around defenses.

Burning a Conti Affiliate’s Cobalt Strike Infrastructure
TRU has been tracking the operations of an active Conti ransomware affiliate since August
2021. During TRU’s research, it discovered that cybersecurity company BreakPoint Labs
(BPL) had also been studying the same Conti affiliate. Therefore, eSentire and BreakPoint
Labs began sharing their findings with one another and uncovered some important details
relating to this affiliate, its infrastructure management methods, and its use of Cobalt Strike. It
is also important to note that the main Conti operators have recently brought the Trickbot
authors, Wizard Spider, into their operation. Members of the Trickbot gang are long time
partners of Conti ,and they have recently developed BazarLoader which downloads
additional malware onto a victim’s computer.
Interestingly, TRU observed this affiliate’s Cobalt Strike infrastructure being leveraged in two
subsequent ransomware attempts on Valentine’s Day of 2022, just as the tensions between
Russia and Ukraine were escalating.
The speed and efficacy of both the intrusion actions and the infrastructure management
indicate automated, at-scale deployment of customized Cobalt Strike configurations and its
associated initial access vectors. Customization choices include legitimate certificates, nonstandard CS ports, and malleable Command and Control (C2). In this report, we will examine
associated ransomware operations, including operations that rely on:
SonicWall exploits
Shathak (TA551) and TR (TA577) malware distribution operations
BazarLoader and IcedID malware
The Cobalt Strike intrusion framework
FiveHands/HelloKitty/DeathKitty ransomware and Conti ransomware
TRU observed sophisticated intrusions conducted from the infrastructure, which are detailed
below, followed by an exploration of the features of the infrastructure. Finally, a list of
indicators comprising the vast Cobalt Strike deployment are provided.

Cobalt Strike at Scale
Following a series of leaks of the Cobalt Strike Intrusion Suite starting in 2020, the tool
quickly rose to prominence in ransomware intrusions. Throughout 2021, eSentire’s TRU
observed that – with few exceptions – hands-on- intrusions invariably relied on Cobalt Strike
(Figure 2). The trend continues into 2022 alongside yet another leak of Cobalt Strike’s latest
version. With each successive leak of the tool, threat actors gain additional features that help
them to evade security and manage intrusions at scale.

source code leaks to the public (vertical black lines)

Why has Cobalt Strike become so popular for ransomware
campaigns?
Ransomware intrusions are full-scale organizational intrusions that require actions such as
discovery, lateral tool transfer and privilege escalation (Figure 3). Not only can Cobalt Strike
do all of that, it can also change up its disguises using malleable C2 and an artifact kit to
evade network and endpoint security. Threat actors need only deliver Cobalt Strike’s Beacon
– a highly configurable backdoor that allows attackers to quietly and remotely control
endpoints and inject other attacker tools – as a payload of their chosen initial access vector,
and Beacon will point back to an attacker – controlled Team Server, where attackers can log
on and intrusions can be orchestrated. Due to Cobalt Strike’s relative simplicity, it enables
lower-tiered threat actors to act in supporting roles to ransomware operations, allowing for
ransomware gangs to scale out their operations and increase efficiencies.
In short, the tool puts most of the features you’d find in other malware in one place. MITRE
describes the tool as follows: “Cobalt Strike’s interactive post-exploit capabilities cover the
full range of ATT&CK tactics, all executed within a single, integrated system.” Cobalt Strike
has been in use and continuously updated with new functionality for at least the past ten
years. It is an “adversarial simulation software,” the developers (have continuously added
evasive features, observed in the wild, to its pen testing capabilities). Cobalt Strike also has
a public community that openly shares aggressor scripts, which allow various plugins and
integrations to be written for Cobalt Strike, and Beacon profiles, which define various
communication protocols for C2. Thus, for many backdoors and RATs available on the
underground market, Cobalt Strike is capable of the same functionality, plus more.

actions allowing the operation to efficiently achieve their objectives

Ransomware Operations Utilizing the Cobalt Strike Infrastructure
TRU observed at least two cybercrime operations utilizing the same Cobalt Strike
infrastructure, during 2021 and into 2022, and both operations are leveraging SonicWall
exploits to deploy a Go variant of the FiveHands/HelloKitty/DeathKitty ransomware family
and they are also employing initial access brokers, associated with the Conti Ransomware
operation. Earlier in the year, SonicWall exploits being used in FiveHands ransomware
campaigns (Figure 4), were associated with FiveHands affiliate UNC2447. A 2021 report by
Mandiant notes the group had previously deployed RagnarLocker. Symantec has since
associated UNC2447 with recent campaigns deploying Yanluowang Ransomware.

infrastructure to deliver a Golang variant of the FiveHands Ransomware
More recently, the same Cobalt Strike infrastructure was observed being leveraged in Conti
ransomware deployments via Shathak (aka TA551) for initial access (Figure 5). Shathak is a
threat group known for launching phishing campaigns that typically utilize malicious
documents, and these often lead to backdoors, such as IcedID. TRU has seen some overlap
5/12

in these campaigns with the TR botnet (aka TA577), which delivers payloads via malicious
documents and which tends to use the same toolset as the Shathak malicious phishing
campaigns.

Figure 5: An operation by the Shathak Group (akaTA551) leveraged BazarLoader through
malicious emails. BazarLoader allowed the operation to pivot to the tracked Cobalt Strike
infrastructure for Conti deployment.

Syndicate Infrastructure
Management of the Cobalt Strike infrastructure appears to be highly automated, potentially
relying on automated name server generation via reseller API. Legitimate and trusted
certificates are deployed to the infrastructure within minutes of domain name creation.
Domain names used for Cobalt Strike Command and Control (C2) reflect a common naming
scheme, typically two to three words or acronyms that reflect common information
technology and known brands. The infrastructure rotates through a consistent range of open
ports and registrar choices (Figure 6). TRU’s analysis of the Conti chat leaks provides some
insight on infrastructure management within the Conti team, but it’s not clear how entwined
the domains tracked here are with this core Conti group. However, the primary candidates
from the leaked chats would be Carter’s infrastructure through which Bentley’s builds
integrate the different tools and malware involved (such as BazarLoader, Cobalt Strike and
the ransomware itself). An excerpt of the domain names, IP addresses and email addresses
being used by this Conti affiliate are enclosed below. It appears that this Cobalt Strike
infrastructure management group has also relied on a variety of ProtonMail email addresses
to register some of their domains:

Sophisticated Intrusions
Combined, TRU and BPL observed the Cobalt Strike infrastructure being leveraged to attack
seven different U.S. companies between 2021 and 2022. The victims include companies in
the financial, environmental, legal and charitable sectors.
In July 2021, the threat actors behind the Cobalt Strike operation compromised four different
financial organizations via one technology provider, which each of the victims were using to
manage their IT environments. Since the technology provider deployed SonicWall as a VPN
solution for its customers, the financial organizations were rendered vulnerable to the
previously mentioned exploits. In these cases, the threat actors were able to delete cloudstored backups prior to ransomware deployment. Luckily, the financial companies had other,
more recent backups, to restore from – a good lesson to follow. The ransomware was later
determined to be the late Go Version of Feral Spider and shared similarities to previous
FiveHands and HelloKitty variants.
More recently, on Valentine’s Day 2022, amidst escalating tensions between Russia and
Ukraine, the TRU intercepted an attack leveraging the Cobalt Strike infrastructure in which
the threat actors were trying to breach a children’s charity and, hours later, they attempted to
breach a legal firm. However, one attack stands out as a demonstration of the power and
capability of the Cobalt Strike Intrusion Suite, should it land in the wrong hands: the
ShadowBeacon Incident.

The Cobalt Strike ShadowBeacon Incident

8/12

The TRU observed the first Cobalt Strike Beacon early in the morning during the summer of
2021. The Beacon instance presented an immediate mystery – it pointed to an internal
device. The infected host was isolated and an investigation into the source of the signal was
opened; another Beacon appeared. Again, a host was isolated. The Beacons were being
deployed from the domain controllers via PsExec, a legitimate administrator tool used for
remotely executing binaries. This time; however, the internal IP was different. Sensing an
active hands-on intrusion, TRU began manually deleting the Beacon instances just as
eSentire’s incident handlers were finding an answer to the shifting Command and Control
channel. The intruders were using Forty North’s C2Concealer. The Beacons were SMB
Beacons, which utilize the organization’s internal SMB traffic for its C2. That meant that the
cloaked internal device likely had an HTTP Beacon–through which it was funneling the traffic
from SMB Beacons to the exterior Cobalt Strike C2 Server. The more common Beacon
utilizes standard internet protocols.
To gain further intelligence around the mysterious internal device required a review of the
Windows logs. Given that the customer wasn’t ingesting their log signals into eSentire’s Atlas
XDR platform, a manual request for logs was initiated, introducing a delay to the
investigation. With domain control and a cloaked machine, the attacker continued to deploy
SMB beacons, struggling to maintain a foothold as incident handlers continued to shut down
Beacon instances. But after receiving and manually reviewing the Windows logs, TRU
discovered the intersection of the SMB traffic and patient zero.

Crafty Threat Actors Bring Their Own Virtual Machine
The Windows logs revealed that the threat actor had been able to register their own virtual
machine on the victim organization’s network, using it as a pivot to their actual, exterior C2.
With the source of the infection no longer hiding in the VPN pool, the attacker was kicked out
and the recovery process started. No ransomware was observed.

Glossary of terms
IcedID – a botnet loader known to arise from malicious documents and often leading to
Cobalt Strike or other backdoors that position threat actors for ransomware deployment.
TR Botnet (akaTA577)– The TR botnet delivers payloads via malicious documents. TR has
been associated with SquirrelWaffle and Qakbot campaigns but has recently been observed
delivering IcedID.

10/12

Shathak (aka TA551)– A cybercrime group that is known for launching phishing campaigns
that typically distribute malicious documents which, in turn, often lead to backdoors such as
IcedID.
Emotet – A loader malware delivered via malicious document through email. Known to
deliver Trickbot and Cobalt Strike.
Trickbot – A botnet loader delivered via malicious documents.
Conti (aka Grim Spider) – A large and sophisticated group of ransomware developers and
operators, known for compromising and disrupting the critical operations of healthcare
organizations, 911 emergency services, municipalities, oil transportation and storage
providers, electric companies, schools, IT service providers, food and pharmaceutical
providers. Conti popularized the modern ransomware model with its original project, Ryuk,
which was delivered via Emotet dropping Trickbot.
Cobalt Strike – An intrusion suite, billed as “adversary simulation” that has sophisticated
evasion features, such as a malleable C2 and an injection kit, to deploy more tools
throughout a victim’s IT environments.
Discovery – generally the first tactic threat actors take when they get hands-on keyboard in
an environment. Discovery helps threat actors determine the kind of endpoint they’ve landed
on and what kind of accounts they can pivot too next.
Lateral Tool Transfer – a technique that allows an active intruder to import more intrusion
tools from their own environment to the victims, including password crackers, exploits and
exfiltration tools.
Privilege Escalation – allows attackers to raise privileges on a compromised account or
obtain credentials for more privileged accounts.
Malleable C2 – allows threat actors to rotate through different communication procedures,
making it harder to track and detect known procedures.
Artifact Kit – a Cobalt Strike feature that allows an active intruder the ability to inject tools
into legitimate windows processes, reducing their chance of detection.
Initial Access – how an intruder gains entry into a victim’s network. Examples include
phishing emails, remote exploits, and supply-chain attacks.
Aggressor Scripts – It is a scripting framework, built within Cobalt Strike 3.0 and later
versions, which will automate and customize the intrusion workflow being conducted by
threat actors. Examples of Aggressor Scripts include notifying the threat actors of a
successful compromise via Slack or running Mimikatz within the victim’s IT environment.
Mimikatz is a credential password stealer tool.

11/12

Beacon—it is the Cobalt Strike’s backdoor.
Beacon Profiles –Beacon profiles define the configuration of the Beacon Backdoor–
including the windows processes (aka injection targets) that artifact kit will use to deploy
tools, how often Beacon will check in with Team Server, and the C2’s URL and port.
