SentinelLabs has been tracking the activity of Agrius, a suspected Iranian threat actor
operating in the Middle East, throughout 2020 and 2021 following a set of destructive attacks
starting December 2020. Since we last reported on this threat actor in May 2020, Agrius
lowered its profile and was not observed conducting destructive activity. This changed
recently as the threat actor likely initiated a ransomware attack on the Israeli university BarIlan utilizing the group’s custom Apostle ransomware.
Although the full technical details of the incident were not disclosed publicly, some
information was released to the public, most notably the ransom demand text file dropped on
victim machines. The .txt file matches that from a new version of Apostle compiled on
August 15, 2021, the day of the attack.
The new version of Apostle is obfuscated, encrypted and compressed as a resource in a
loader we call Jennlog, as it attempts to masquerade payload in resources as log files.
Before executing the Apostle payload, Jennlog runs a set of tests to verify that it is not being
executed in an analysis environment based on an embedded configuration. Following the
analysis of the Jennlog loader, SentinelLabs retrieved an additional variant of Jennlog, used
to load and run OrcusRAT.

Jennlog Analysis
Jennlog ( 5e5e526a69490399494dcd7195bb6c67 ) is a .NET loader that deobfuscates,
decompresses and decrypts a .NET executable from a resource embedded within the file.
The resources within the loader appear to look like log files, and it contains both the binary to
run as well as a configuration for the malware’s execution.
Jennlog attempts to extract two different resources:
helloworld.pr.txt – stores Apostle payload and the configuration.
helloworld.Certificate.txt – contains None. If configured to do so, the malware

compares the MD5 value of the system information (used as system fingerprint) to the
contents of this resource.
The payload hidden in “ helloworld.pr.txt ” appears to look like a log file at first sight:

Contents of “ helloworld.pr.txt ” resource embedded within Jennlog
The payload is extracted from the resource by searching for a separator word –
“ Jennifer ”. Splitting the contents of the resource results in an array of three strings:
1. Decoy string – Most likely there to make the log file look more authentic.
2. Configuration string – Used to determine the configuration of the malware execution.
3. Payload – An obfuscated, compressed and encrypted file.

Configuration
The configuration of Jennlog consists of 13 values, 12 of which are actually used in this
version of the malware. In the variants we were able to retrieve, all of these flags are set to 0.

Jennlog configuration values
One of the most interesting flags found here is the certificate flag. If this flag is set, it will
cause the malware to run only on a specific system. If this system does not match the
configured MD5 fingerprint, the malware either stops operation or deletes itself utilizing the
function ExecuteInstalledNodeAndDelete() , which creates and runs a BAT file as
observed in other Agrius malware.

Jennlog ExecuteInstalledNodeAndDelete() function
Following all the configuration based-checks, Jennlog continues to unpack the main binary
from within the resource “ helloworld.pr.txt ” by performing the following string
manipulations in the function EditString() on the obfuscated payload:
Replace all “ \nLog ” with “ A ”.
Reverse the string.
Remove all whitespaces.
This manipulation will result in a long base64-encoded deflated content, which is inflated
using the function stringCompressor.Unzip() . The inflated content highly resembles the
contents of the original obfuscated payload, and it is deobfuscated again using the
EditString() function.
The deobfuscation of the inflated content is carried out in a rather peculiar way, being run as
a “catch” statement after attempting to turn a string containing a URL to int, which will always
result in an error. The domain presented in the URL was never bought, and highly resembles
other Agrius malware unpurchased domains, often used as “Super Relays”. Here, however,
the domain is not actually contacted.

Execution of EditString() function as a catch statement
Following a second run of the EditString() function, Jennlog decodes the extracted
content and decrypts it using an implementation of RC4 with a predefined key. The extracted
content found in this sample is a new version of the Apostle ransomware, which is loaded
into memory and ran using the parameters given to Jennlog at execution.

Apostle Ransomware Analysis
The new variant of Apostle ( cbdbda089f7c7840d4daed22c34969fd876315b6 ) embedded
within the Jennlog loader was compiled on August 15, 2021, the day the attack on Bar-Ilan
university was carried out. Its execution flow is highly similar to the variant described in
previous reports, and it even checks for the same Mutex as the previous ransomware
variant.
The message embedded within it, however, is quite different:
Ooops, Your files are encrypted!!! Don't worry,You can return all your files!
If you want to restore theme, Send $10000 worth of Monero to following address :
43JuFUyzfcKQwTzCTHpQoA8uLGtbwFBLyeeXoYEEU5dZLhLT1cZJDk4cytjcgQT7kdjSerJqpEp2gUcH91bjLc
Then follow this Telegram ID :

This is the exact same message that was released to the media in the context of the Bar-Ilan
ransomware incident, as reported on ynet:

Ransom demand text file as seen in Bar-Ilan university
Other than the ransom demand note, the wallpaper picture used on affected machines was
also changed, this time presenting an image of a clown:

OrcusRAT Jennlog Loader
An additional variant of Jennlog ( 43b810f918e357669be42030a1feb727 ) was uploaded to
VirusTotal on July 14, 2021 from Iran. This variant is highly similar to the one used to load
Apostle, and contains a similar configuration scheme (all set to 0). It is used to load a variant
of OrcusRAT, which is extracted from the files resources in a similar manner.
The OrcusRAT variant ( add7b6b60e746c36a66f5ec233873372 ) extracted from within it
was submitted to VT on June 20, 2021 using the same submitter ID from Iran. It seems to
connect to an internal IP address – 192.168.178.114 , indicating it might have been used
for testing. It also contained the following PDB path:
C:\Users\dou\Desktop\repo\arcu-win\src\Orcus\obj\Debug\Orcus.pdb

Conclusion
Agrius has shown a willingness to strategically wipe systems and has continued to evolve its
toolkit to enable ransomware operations. At this time, we don’t know if the actor is committed
to financially-motivated operations, but we do know the original intent was sabotage. We
expect the sort of subterfuge seen here to be deployed in future Agrius operations.
SentinelLabs continues to track the development of this nascent threat actor.
