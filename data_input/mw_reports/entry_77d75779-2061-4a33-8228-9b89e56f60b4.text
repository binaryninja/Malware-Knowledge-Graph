Several weeks ago, my good friend Katie Nickels (Director of Intelligence at Red Canary
extraordinaire) and I were chatting about Ransomware. She was super interested and
passionate about some new uses of a ransomware variant named “Ryuk” (first
detected in 2018 and named after a manga/anime character) [1]. I was, to be honest,
much less interested. It turns out, as usual, Katie was right; this was a big deal (although as
you will see, I’m right too… still dull stuff!).
On October 29th CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency) posted Alert AA-20-302
(since updated) discussing Ryuk as an “imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and
healthcare providers.” If you’ve been paying attention to the ransomware world for the last
couple of months, there was a declared “ceasefire” as ransomware operators proclaimed
that they would not target hospitals during COVID. This announcement was, perhaps not
surprisingly, not accurate. Over the last couple of months, Ryuk has been ravaging public
institutions like hospitals and city governments, causing delays in surgeries and possibly
causing actual deaths [2] [3]. Suppose you are interested in the attribution of the Ryuk
operators or a deep dive into the malware? In that case, I recommend you read some of the

great blogs/postings from Mandiant or Red Canary on the subject. Otherwise, buckle up for
discussion on some resources to help detect and even possibly remediate Ryuk using
Splunk!

Quick Breakdown of the Ryuk Kill Chain
Although Ryuk is getting the headlines, what I find most interesting about Ryuk is that it is
actually the final step of a multi-staged attack. Historically Ryuk was delivered with a
spearphishing attack using a weaponized Microsoft Word document to drop Emotet or
Trickbot trojans. The malware would be installed and used to survey a network, steal creds,
move laterally, and gain footholds on critical servers like domain controllers to modify GPO
settings. All of this amounts to a type of reconnaissance to find the most vital “crown jewels”
of the company that are ripe for ransom. The most recent behavior has shown actors
sending google documents with embedded links asking the user to click on the URL, which
then delivers a newish-trojan named Bazar or even Cobalt Strike. Then, using Bazar’s
capabilities, the actors perform the same reconnaissance and establishment of footholds.
The outcome of either of these initial vectors is the use of Ryuk ransomware to encrypt files
and demand a payout via “RyukReadMe.txt” (which was the genesis of the Ryuk name).
So what’s new, fascinating, or different about Ryuk versus other ransomware? To be
honest... not much. It’s just typical Spearphishing with a 2-year-old (albeit updated) variant
of ransomware (if you are interested, my colleague Rod Soto from the Splunk Threat
Research team also released a blog, Detecting Ryuk Using Splunk Attack Range, showing
how to use the Splunk Attack Range to simulate and detect Ryuk). The reason it’s hitting
the news is that they are targeting healthcare facilities amid a global pandemic.
Suppose I had to pick one thing out of the mix of Ryuk/Bazar/Trickbot TTPs to stay
awake about? I’d probably point out that the ransomware uses the initial trojan vector
to ensure that the ransomware is deployed on the most critical parts of an organization’s
network rather than just “encrypt and pray.” Some reports have shown a 56-minute delta
between initial infection and ransomware encryption activity. THAT “human touch” has been
what has made it so maddeningly effective and dangerous.

Detection of Ryuk
Usually, this blog post section is filled with fun TTPs pulled from the zero-day or possibly a
breakdown of a new malware variant. But, after reviewing the last six years of content that
Splunk has created, I am proud to say that we already have you covered. On top of the
corpus of general ransomware detection information listed below, it is essential to
note that the Splunk Threat Research team has released detections to Ryuk, Trickbot
and Bazar to both Splunk Security Essentials (SSE) and Splunk Enterprise Security
Content Update (ESCU) in release 3.0.9. In my list of detections below, you will notice that
I did not break out IOCs. As David Bianco has pyramidized in the past, IOCs are ephemeral
and change often! I recommend working with a threat intel provider for any low-level IOCs
2/5

like hashes or IPs. Throw them into a Lookup table or ES threat intel framework, and off you
go! If you don’t have a threat intel provider, start skimming Twitter for some tremendous
open-source lists.

Splunk Security Essentials
In case you are unaware (or living under a rock for the last two years), Splunk Security
Essentials is one of the key places to get Splunk’s security content. When you boot up the
app, navigate to “security content,” and search for Ransomware, you get a plethora of
content!

On top of that, I took the MITRE ATT&CK Techniques from the CISA alert and selected the
SSE detection content that mapped to them. It turns out we have over 45 searches to
detect Ryuk and trojans like Bazar, Trickbot, or Emotet.

I bet you would love to get this information, wouldn’t you… Well, you can either download
this 825 page PDF OR copy the JSON blob here of this bookmarked content and upload it
into your updated SSE local instance. As always, try in dev before prod! Also, some of
these searches may need to be modified to detect Ryuk with greater confidence. Refer to
the CISA alert or the excellent work from Red Canary if you want more atomic TTPs of the
malware for integration into your signatures.

Historical Corpus
Now, of course, this is not the only content that Splunk has created around Ransomware. In
addition, take a peek at Rod Soto’s blog for some examples of where our Security
Research team is developing explicit Ryuk content.

Also a big shout out to Katie Nickels for reminding me that Ransomware is still kind of a big
deal. ;-)
