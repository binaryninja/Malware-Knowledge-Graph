BitRAT Disguised as Windows Product Key Verification
Tool Being Distributed

March 21, 2022

The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered BitRAT which is being distributed via
webhards. Because the attacker disguised the malware as Windows 10 license verification
tool from the development stage, users who download illegal crack tools from webhard and
install it to verify Windows license are at risk of having BitRAT installed into their PC.
The following shows a post that was uploaded to webhard, one that harbors the malware.
The title is [New][Quick Install]Windows License Verification[One-click].

Figure 2. Post disguised as download of Windows license verification tool – 2
A compressed file named ‘Program.zip’ is downloaded, and it is compressed and locked with
a password ‘1234’. It contains a Windows 10 license verification tool named
‘W10DigitalActivation.exe’.

Figure 3. Files included in compressed file
‘W10DigitalActivation.exe’ is a 7z SFX file that carries an actual verification tool called
‘W10DigitalActivation.msi’ and the malware named W10DigitalActivation_Temp.msi. When
the user double-clicks the file, it installs both files concurrently. As both the malware and the
verification tool are run at the same time, the user is tricked into thinking that the tool is
running properly as shown below.

Figure 4. Malware inside 7z SFX file
Unlike its name, ‘W10DigitalActivation_Temp.msi’ is a downloader with exe extension that
downloads additional malware. When run, it connects to following C&C servers it harbors
internally, exchanging encrypted strings. Afterward, it decrypts the strings to ultimately
acquire a download URL for the additional payload.

The downloader installs the malware into the Windows startup program folder and deletes
itself. Normally, the first file that is installed is a downloader of the same kind, and the
downloader run this way ultimately installs BitRAT into the path %TEMP% as
‘Software_Reporter_Tool.exe’.

Figure 6. Downloading downloader and BitRAT
Note that this downloader is equipped with additional features and is not a simple program
by any means. As shown in the figure below, one of its features uses a powershell command
to add the Windows startup program folder—where the downloader will be installed—as an
exclusion path for Windows Defender, and adding the BitRAT process name
‘Software_Reporter_Tool.exe’ as an exclusion process for Windows Defender.

Seeing how this malware uses webhard which is considered as the most-used file-sharing
platform in Korea and includes Korean characters in its code as shown in the figure below, it
appears that the attacker is a Korean speaker.

The malware that is ultimately installed is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware called
BitRAT. BitRAT has been in sale via a hacking forum since 2020 and is being continuously
used by attackers.

Because BitRAT is a RAT malware, its attacker can gain control of the system infected with
it. BitRAT not only provides basic control features such as running process tasks, service
tasks, file tasks, and remote commands, but also provides extra options such as various infostealing features, HVNC, remote desktop, coin mining, and proxies.

The following is the list of the features that BitRAT provides.
1. Network Communication Method
– Encrypted communication using TLS 1.2
– Communication using Tor
2. Basic Control
– Process manager
– Service manager
– File manager
– Windows manager
– Software manager
3. Information Theft
– Keylogging
– Clipboard logging
– Webcam logging
– Audio logging
– Application (e.g. Web browsers) account credential theft
4. Remote Control
– Remote desktop
– hVNC (Hidden Desktop)
5. Proxy
– SOCKS5 Proxy: port forwarding feature using UPnP
– Reverse Proxy: SOCKS4 Proxy

6. Coin Mining
– XMRig CoinMiner
7. etc.
– DDoS attack
– UAC Bypass
– Windows Defender deactivation
Note that BitRAT uses the revealed TinyNuke’s code, just like AveMaria. The following is a
comparison of TinyNuke’s hVNC (routine related to Hidden Desktop) and BitRAT’s code.

Figure 12. TinyNuke and BitRAT’s hVNC routine
TinyNuke verifies and uses a signature string called ‘AVE_MARIA’ in Reverse SOCKS4
Proxy and Hidden Desktop feature. AveMaria adopted Reverse SOCKS4 Proxy feature from
TinyNuke, and the name was given based on the string. BitRAT, on the other hand, used
Hidden Desktop feature, and the signature string is the same.
Note that TinyNuke was used by the Kimsuky group in the past. Among myriad of features,
only the Hidden Desktop feature was adopted and used.

As shown in the examples above, the malware is being distributed actively via file-sharing
websites such as Korean webhards. As such, caution is advised when running executables
downloaded from a file-sharing website. It is recommended for the users to download
products from the official websites of developers.
