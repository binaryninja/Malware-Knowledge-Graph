Microsoft patches six Windows zero-days, including a
commercial exploit

June 9, 2021

Microsoft has released today its monthly batch of security updates, known in the
industry as Patch Tuesday.
This month’s security patches fix 50 vulnerabilities, including six actively exploited Windows
zero-days, representing the largest batch of actively exploited zero-days patched in one go in
the company’s recent history.
CVE-2021-33742 – Windows MSHTML Platform Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31955 – Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31956 – Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31962 – Kerberos AppContainer Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31199 – Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege
Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31201 – Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege
Vulnerability
Details about how the six zero-days have been kept under wraps, as is usually the case with
these types of disclosures, primarily to give defenders more time to apply patches before
other threat actors can learn how to exploit the bugs.

However, some small details have leaked, from Google and Kaspersky, two of the
companies that reported the ongoing attacks to Microsoft in the first place.

CVE-2021-33742: A commercial exploit
The most interesting of the six zero-days is CVE-2021-33742, a remote code execution
vulnerability in the MSHTML component that is part of the Internet Explorer browser.
In a tweet on Tuesday, Shane Huntley, head of the Google Threat Analysis Group, said his
team discovered this vulnerability being abused in the wild and all signs pointed that the
exploit appears to have been developed by a professional commercial exploit broker.
While Huntley didn’t share technical details about the zero-day, which he promised his team
will share in 30 days, the Google TAG head said the exploit appears to have been used by a
nation-state for a small number of attacks against targets in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East.
More details will be on CVE-2021-33742 will come from the team, but for context this
seem to be a commercial exploit company providing capability for limited nation state
Eastern Europe / Middle East targeting.

Two zero-days targeted recent versions of Windows 10
But while Google was able to link the MSHTML zero-day attacks to an exploit broker and a
nation-state entity, Kaspersky is still looking for details about two zero-days its researchers
caught last month.
Tracked as CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956, the Russian security firm said the two
Windows bugs were part of a complex exploit chain that also involved a web delivery via the
Chrome browser.
“While we were not able to retrieve the exploit used for remote code execution (RCE) in the
Chrome web browser, we were able to find and analyze an elevation of privilege (EoP)
exploit that was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges,” researchers said
in a report published today shortly after Microsoft released its Patch Tuesday updates.
Both Windows zero-days, which exploited two distinct vulnerabilities in the Microsoft
Windows OS kernel, were particularly interesting because they were fine-tuned to work
against the latest and most prominent builds of Windows 10 (17763 – RS5, 18362 – 19H1,
18363 – 19H2, 19041 – 20H1, 19042 – 20H2), suggesting that the threat actor was
interested in targeting modern and up-to-date devices.

Two 0-days linked to last month’s Adobe Reader zero-day

Additionally, Microsoft also patched two zero-days in CVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201
that were related to an Adobe Reader zero-day (CVE-2021-28550) that Adobe patched last
month in May.
Both zero-days impact one of Microsoft’s cryptographic libraries and even impact old
versions of Windows, such as 7 and Server 2012.
Unfortunately, neither the Adobe nor the Microsoft patch notes reveal any information about
the attacks.
