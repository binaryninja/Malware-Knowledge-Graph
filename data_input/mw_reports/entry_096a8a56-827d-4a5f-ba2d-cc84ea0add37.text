Sector Resilience Report: Electric Power Delivery
June 11, 2014, 1015 EDT

SCOPE
The Department of Homeland Security Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis
(DHS/OCIA)1 Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center (HITRAC) produces
Sector Resilience Reports to improve partner understanding of the interdependencies and
resilience of certain sectors. Specifically, this report provides a brief overview of the electric
power system, and analysis of key electric power system dependencies and interdependencies.
Additionally, this product includes an assessment of, and best practices for, improving
community, system, and facility resilience. This Sector Resilience Report was produced to
complement other sector-specific guidance, analysis, and scholarly papers on infrastructure
resilience by applying data obtained from DHS site visits and assessments analyzing the
resilience of critical infrastructure assets and systems.
The resilience issues and best practices identified in this document may be considered by critical
infrastructure partners in each sector to improve their resilience at three levels: electric power
provider systems and facilities, community risk management organizations (e.g. State or local
emergency operations centers or fusion centers), and any critical infrastructure asset or system
that depends on electric power. This product was coordinated with the DHS Office of
Infrastructure Protection, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC).

KEY FINDINGS
 Of the 3,352 sites across all 16 sectors that received DHS assessments (2009–2012),
90 percent depend on electric power for core operations.

 Critical dependencies and interdependencies of the Energy Sector mean that the loss
of electric power can quickly cascade to other lifeline infrastructure systems
(including Water, Wastewater, Communications, Transportation, and Information
Technology (IT)), potentially degrading services necessary for public health and
safety.

In February 2014, NPPD created the Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis by integrating analytic resources from across NPPD including
the Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center (HITRAC) and the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center
(NISAC).

 Of the 41 electric power substations assessed by DHS, 59 percent depend upon an
external source of electric power for on-site operations, 62 percent depend on
communications, and 77 percent depend on IT to maintain operations.

 Interruption to IT supporting infrastructures, including the loss of electric power,
could limit the operating flexibility and efficiency of electric substations and system
monitoring equipment. A large-scale IT disruption could potentially impact power
delivery to other critical infrastructure assets in the electric service area.

ELECTRIC POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
The U.S. electric power delivery system is a highly complex network of substations and electric
lines that transport electricity from generators to residential, commercial, and industrial
consumers. For this reportthe electric power delivery system includes all components between
the point where power is injected into the grid and the point where the power enters the
customer’s premises. Figure 1 provides an overview of a representative electric power delivery
system, and identifies nodes along the electric system that are suseptible to certain key hazards.
The contiguous 48 States, most of Canada, and parts of Mexico are served by a bulk power
system comprising more than 200,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines (230 kilovolts
(kV) or greater), tens of thousands of miles of distribution lines operated at lower voltages, and
an estimated 100,000 substations from which power is ultimately directed to customers.2,3,4,5 To
facilitate efficient transfer over long distances, electricity produced at a power plant is first
directed to step-up transformers located in transmission substations, where the voltage is
increased and then introduced into the transmission grid.
When the power arrives near a distribution territory, step-down transformers located in
distribution substations reduce the voltage and transfer the power to the distribution grid along
smaller distribution lines that are buried or carried on poles. Transformers located closer to
individual customers, often on poles, further reduce the voltage to meet each customer’s demand.
Substations at both the transmission and distribution levels are strategically interconnected,
giving operators multiple pathways by which to deliver power to meet individual loads and
greatly enhancing the overall resilience of the electrical transmission and distribution networks.

RESILIENCE
The common themes shared in this report are drawn from data obtained from DHS site visits,
including the Enhanced Critical Infrastructure Protection (ECIP) Initiative, analysis produced by
the Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP), and information gleaned from industry
reports and academic research.6,7 This paper summarizes results from numerous infrastructure
assessments that examine vulnerabilities, threats, and
potential consequences from an all-hazards perspective,

emergencies.”

Since 1996, the critical infrastructure community has
evolved from a primary focus on protective security to a
greater emphasis on resilience to disruptive events.9
National policies, such as Policy Presidential Directives
(PPDs) 8 and 21, highlight that collaborative
engagement and information sharing with Federal
agencies, private sector facility owners and operators,
law enforcement, emergency response organizations,
academic institutions, and other stakeholders are vital to
building a more resilient Nation.

PPD—21, Critical Infrastructure
Security and Resilience, directed the
Federal Government to work with critical
infrastructure owners and operators and
State, local, tribal, and territorial partners
to strengthen the security and resilience of
its critical infrastructure.

THREATS AND HAZARDS
The electric power delivery system faces a broad range of potential threats and hazards, ranging
from cyberattacks to a variety of natural hazards, including various weather-related phenomena
(as shown in Figure 1). Electricity infrastructure is highly automated and controlled by utilities
and regional grid operators that rely on sophisticated industrial control systems. These control
systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks that could potentially disrupt electric power
production or transmission. Accidents or physical attacks on electric power infrastructure, such
as targeted shooting of transformers or intentional downing of power lines, also pose a threat for
the Sector’s continued reliable operations.10 Natural events such as hurricanes, earthquakes,
winter storms, wildfires, and solar flares also present a significant hazard to the electric power
system, as these events occur regularly and have the capacity to cause extensive and widespread
6

The RRAP evaluates critical infrastructure on a regional level to examine vulnerabilities, threats, and potential consequences from an allhazards perspective, identifying dependencies, interdependencies, cascading effects, resilience characteristics, and gaps. RRAP projects are
voluntary and non-regulatory, and rely on engagement and information sharing with Federal agencies, private sector facility owners and
operators, law enforcement, emergency response organizations, academic institutions, and other stakeholders. For more information, please
email resilience@dhs.gov or visit www.dhs.gov/regional-resiliency-assessment-program.

The ECIP Initiative is a voluntary program where DHS Protective Security Advisors conduct outreach with critical infrastructure facility
owners and operators and provide security surveys, training and education, and recommended protective measures. ECIP metrics provide DHS
with information on the protective and resilience measures in place at facilities and enable detailed analyses of site and sector vulnerabilities.
For more information, please contact PSCDOperations@hq.dhs.gov.

The Federal Government began to examine potential threats to critical infrastructure in the 1990s as a result of incidents of domestic and
international terrorism. President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13010 in 1996, which identified the Nation’s critical infrastructure
sectors and established a Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) whose objective was to recommend a
comprehensive national infrastructure protection policy and implementation strategy.

damage. Such threats and hazards can cause extensive damage to electric power systems, but due
to system resiliency the effects may not result in significant power outages.
In 2012, the U.S. transmission grid experienced 2,068 sustained automatic outages, which lasted
for a total of 71,822 hours.11 The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) 2014

DEPENDENCIES, INTERDEPENDENCIES, AND POTENTIAL
IMPACTS
The resilience of a community or region is a function of the resilience of its subsystems,
including its critical infrastructure, economy, civil society, and governance (including emergency
services). Resilience can be highly complex due to the dependencies and interdependencies that
exist within infrastructure systems, the regions they serve, and the potential for cascading
consequences. The loss of electric power within a community can happen at any time as the
result of faulty equipment, severe weather, flooding, cyberattack, vegetation control, accident, or
sabotage. The loss of electric power is not just an inconvenience for the utility customers. Its
impacts can quickly cascade to other lifeline systems, including the Water and Wastewater
System Sector, Communications, Transportation, and IT, resulting in the loss of services
necessary to the community’s economy, public health, and safety. Backup power supplies can
mitigate these cascading effects in some cases. Understanding these dependencies and
interdependies are important keys to building and maintaining resilent electric power delivery
systems.
Electric power substations are an important component of the electric power delivery system,
and provide a useful study of the system’s dependencies and interdependencies. The following
sections will discuss the dependencies of substations on three critical infrastructure services—
electric power, communications, and IT—and the dependencies of other critical infrastructure on
the electric delivery system. DHS assessment data from the RRAP and the Enhanced Critical
Infrastructure Protection (ECIP) program, in which DHS partners with State and local agencies
and the private sector to conduct voluntary assessments of a large number of critical
infrastructure facilities, was analyzed to determine potential dependencies and resilience of the
electric power delivery system.13

ELECTRIC POWER SUBSTATIONS
Since January 2011, DHS has conducted 41 assessments of distribution and transmission
substations to collect data on substation dependencies and resilience.14 Of the 41 substations
assessed, 59 percent depend upon an external source of electric power for on-site operations,
62 percent depend on communications, and 77 percent depend on IT to maintain operations.
Electric power, required to operate substation automated switches and supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, is often provided from a station service line, rather than
from the power passing through the station. Any interruption to these control systems, including
the loss of electric power, can mean the loss of substation functionality and the potential
subsequent loss of power to other critical infrastructure assets (e.g., to communication and IT
facilities; a critical infrastructure interdependency).

13

Site assessments under the ECIP and RRAP are voluntary; they may not be representative of the entire sector. The information and data from
the RRAP and the Infrastructure Survey Tool (IST, on which the ECIP security survey resides) are often protected as For Official Use Only or
as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information; the information provided below has been sanitized to remove any facility, system, or regional
references.
14
There are 10,287 transmission substations and 2,179 distribution substations in the United States, according to the DOE, The Electric Delivery
System, accessed May 10, 2013, www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~stephc/EP/Research/Waste% 20Cycle/factsheet.pdf.

There are many factors that determine the criticality of
a particular substation. How a substation is connected
to the facilities that it serves or to the surrounding
transmission system affects its role and contribution to
the overall resilience of the interconnected grid. For
example, a substation that acts as a single source of
electric power to a critical facility is more important to
operations than a substation that is connected in a
looped fashion with other substations and the critical
facility. Similarly, a transmission substation that is
connected with other surrounding substations and
transmission lines may be less critical if disrupted.
Fifty-four percent of all the substations assessed by
DHS that depend on external electric power have
backup electric generation. Further, substations that
have no backup generation capability, 15 percent of the
41, would be expected to experience 67 to 99 percent
degradation in operations. Of those substations that
depend on communications to operate, 89 percent have
alternate or redundant capability and could maintain at
least 67 percent of their full operations. However, of
those substations that depend on external IT services,
only 13 percent could maintain at least 67 percent of
full operations if IT services were lost.

Data Collection and Levels of
Facility Degradation
The ECIP Initiative collects data
through the Infrastructure Survey Tool
(IST), a secure web-based tool that
provides the ability to collect, process,
and analyze survey data in near real
time. Data collected during site visits
are consolidated in the IST and then
valued and weighted, which enables
DHS to develop metrics; conduct
sector-by-sector and cross-sector
vulnerability comparisons; identify
security gaps and trends across critical
infrastructure sectors and sub-sectors;
and establish sector baseline security
survey scores.
The term “dependency,” as used in the
IST and reported here, is defined as the
reliance of a facility on an
outside/external utility or service to
carry out its “core operations.”
Degradation addresses how soon a
facility will be impacted and to what
extent if the source is lost. Data on
degradation are gathered in the IST as
a mutually exclusive set of answers:
0 percent degradation, 1 to33 percent
degradation, 34 to66 percent
degradation, 67 to99 percent
degradation, or 100 percent
degradation.

Recovery may require considerable time and effort to
restore a substation’s significant assets to full operation
depending on what equipment is damaged. Substations
include transformers, circuit breakers, disconnect
switches, bus-bars, shunt reactors, shunt capacitors,
current and potential transformers, and control and

substations, that are essential for isolating (deenergizing) segments of the network for inspections
and repairs. Depending on the variables such as extent of damage and availability of equipment
and personnel, full restoration of a substation can take from 9 days to more than 1 year.15

IMPACTS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FROM LOSS OF
ELECTRIC POWER
Impacts from the loss of electric power vary greatly depending on the severity and location of the
loss within the system. Isolated incidents at a single distribution substation, or along individual
distribution lines, can create localized outages that may last several hours. An incident at a
transmission or subtransmission substation, or along a high-voltage transmission line, can create
more widespread and significant impacts if appropriate protective measures outlined in
contingency plans and operating guides are not achievable by system operators. The loss of
multiple substations and lines, which can occur during a large-scale weather event like a
hurricane, may result in the loss of electricity to millions of customers. As a result of the
diversity of impacts from disrupted substations or transmission lines, restoration of the power
transmission and distribution system can take days to weeks, depending on the ability to bypass
damaged substations or disrupted lines using the built-in resilience of the interconnected grid.
Historically, the loss of electric power delivery systems has resulted in some degree of crosssector impacts, particularly to other lifeline systems.
Figure 3 provides a notional depiction of the physical interconnection of lifeline systems to a
distribution substation and the impacts of the loss of electric power. Of the total sites that DHS
assessed through RRAP and ECIP surveys, 90 percent depend on electric power for operations.16
To illustrate the possible cross-sector impacts, data gathered from selected critical lifeline
systems, including Water, Wastewater, Transportation, Communications, and IT facilities, were
used to provide information about the ability of critical infrastructure facilities to operate during
an electric power outage. The dependency data for each asset in Figure 3 were based on the
median resilient facility within each lifeline system.17
As the results in Figure 3 indicate, the significant cross-sector impacts that occur from the loss of
electric power, including the loss of SCADA functions for other lifeline sectors, underscore the
importance of enhancing the resilience of the electric power delivery system. In addition, an indepth knowledge of the resilience capabilities of lifeline system assets is crucial to effectively
prioritizing response and recovery activities prior to, during, and after an event.
The example in Figure 3 depicts that water treatment plants dependence on electricity to supply
raw water, whether by pumping from groundwater or surface water; for treatment processes
(e.g., rapid mixing); or for pumping treated water to the distribution system. For water systems
with elevated distribution service areas, loss of electricity to pumps can result in isolation of
portions of the system. Similarly, wastewater treatment plants depend on electricity for the
collection of wastewater (e.g., lift stations) and for treatment processes.18

16

Between August 2009 and December 2012, 3,352 sites in all 16 DHS Sectors received DHS visits.
The median resilient facility is based on the value of the overall Infrastructure Survey Tool Resilience Measurement Index, or RMI. The mean
value of a variable, also commonly referred to as the average, is calculated by summing the observed values and then dividing by the total
number of observations. The max is the highest RMI for any of the 41 substations in the comparison group and the min is the lowest. Argonne

The data that was collected and illustrated in Figure 3 shows up to 33 percent of water treatment
plant operations could be immediately degraded due to loss of external electric power. DHS
infrastructure site assessments indicated that 91 percent of water treatment plants and 82 percent
of wastewater treatment plants have backup generators. Failure of both external electric power
and backup power systems can result in severe consequences for water treatment systems. For
example, in 2011, power outages during Hurricane Irene on the East Coast in August and the
October snowstorm in the New England area resulted in a combined total of 50 sewage spills that
discharged millions of gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage into Connecticut’s
waterways when backup power systems failed at a number of facilities.19
Due to the dependencies and interdependencies of critical infrastructure sectors, cascading
failures are a potential consequence of any incident. An example of a cascading failure is when
wastewater treatment systems fail due to a power outage and discharge untreated or partially
treated sewage to waterways that supply raw water to downstream drinking water treatment
plants. If a downstream water treatment plant does not have a disinfection process capable of
treating contaminated raw water, drinking water supplies will also be impacted—even if that
plant has electric power.
Communication switching facility operations can be severely degraded due to a loss of external
electric power, as depicted in Figure 3. Although 71 percent of communication facilities that
DHS assessed have backup generators to maintain switching functions, a prolonged electric
outage requires the delivery of fuel. In addition, although many cell towers may have battery
backup, such systems will last from a few hours to a day. IT facilities may have uninterruptible
power supplies (UPSs), but these too are of limited duration. DHS data indicates that 88 percent
of IT data management facilities surveyed use UPSs to maintain operations.
DHS infrastructure assessments of road transportation, specifically tunnels, as shown in Figure 3,
indicate that up to 33 percent of assets would experience immediate functional degradation from
a loss of external electric power. Roadway tunnels are dependent on electric power for core
operations (e.g., lighting, traffic control equipment, and ventilation). While most assets have
some type of backup generator, complete power loss could impact traffic levels to keep carbon
monoxide at a safe-level. Traffic flow would also cease in tunnels if water began to enter the
tunnels due to water pump power loss.

RESILIENCE ISSUES AND BEST PRACTICES
Table 1 presents commonly observed resilience issues and best practices summarized for three
categories of users: electric power provider systems and facilities, community risk management
organizations (i.e., State or local emergency operation centers or fusion centers), and any critical
infrastructure asset or system that depends on electric power (i.e., electric power customers). The
issues and best practices listed in Table 1 were identified in RRAPs and from among the results
of the ECIP assessments, as well as general literature reviews.20 The information is meant for
general application across the electric power delivery system, impacted sectors, and customers.
The resilience issues and best practices identified may apply to other regions, other facilities, or
other types of facilities. See the Appendix for supporting resources and references.
TABLE 1.—Resilience Issues and Best Practices.

FOR ELECTRIC POWER PROVIDER SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES
Electric utilities may have issues with equipment failures that impact rapid response and recovery


Continue with Smart Grid programs and develop capital improvement plans that incorporate Smart Grid
technology over time as aging equipment is replaced or retrofitted.

The electric distribution grid may lack adequate design redundancies


Use flow modeling to identify areas that can be impacted by single points of failure. In coordination with
the State Homeland Security agency, identify lifeline system assets within the potentially impacted
service territory and work with those assets to identify measures that can be taken to mitigate outages.



Review restoration plans and resources to determine the availability of specialized equipment, crews,
and materials.



Consult with State officials to determine whether the State can support transmission network upgrade
projects through emergency or reliability programs.

High-consequence substations may not have the latest technology


Conduct a cost-benefit analysis that examines the application of automated intelligent switching to the
transmission lines supporting high-consequence substations.



Work with State and local emergency managers and energy assurance planners to apply such
technology where the benefits outweigh the costs.

Electric equipment lacks protection from natural hazards, accidents, or sabotage


Determine whether equipment is at risk to natural hazards, accidents, or sabotage.



Harden at-risk equipment against natural disasters, such as flooding. Move at-risk equipment to higher
ground or build flood containment structures. Develop flood mitigation plans for at-risk substations.



Install protective measures, such as fencing and bollards, around equipment that is at risk of sabotage or
accident and, if necessary, install fire/blast walls to protect adjacent equipment.

20

Resilience information gathered via the RRAP and ECIP assessments are often protected as For Official Use Only or as Protected Critical
Infrastructure Information; the information in Table 1 has been sanitized to remove any facility, system, or regional references.

11

FOR COMMUNITY RISK MANAGEMENT ENTITIES
State and local emergency management agencies lack information on equipment and resource
reserves in other agencies or neighboring States or communities


Work with the local utility to understand private sector capabilities and resources.



Develop memoranda of understanding or agreements with utilities for resource sharing and identify other
areas where the Government and private sector can share resources.

State and local emergency management agencies lack information on prioritizing fuel deliveries to
critical governmental emergency response agencies and to privately owned, critical infrastructure
facilities that are dependent on emergency generators or need fuel for repair vehicles


Governmental agencies should ensure that emergency operations centers have identified critical
equipment and determined the emergency generation capabilities, including fuel needs.



State and local energy assurance plans should include provisions for the distribution of petroleum fuels to
priority government and privately owned critical infrastructure and lifeline sector customers following a
disaster.



In the event of severe fuel shortages during which suppliers need to ration the fuel supply for an
extended period (1 month or longer), implement a statewide set-aside program or priority end-user
program.



Review governmental contracts to assess the potential impact of Excuse by Failure of Presupposed
Conditions provisions under Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-615, as adopted in each State.

Citizens need to be better informed on the necessary steps to take to help ensure personal
resilience and preparedness for prolonged electric power outages


Conduct outreach to inform citizens of steps they can take to prepare for a blackout; such outreach will
also aid local utilities by reducing calls for information and damage/distress calls.

Emergency response agencies may not always communicate effectively with the population


Use social media to communicate in disaster preparation, response, and recovery.

Electric utilities are not part of the State and local emergency response planning process


To improve communication among electric distribution providers, customers, and State and local
emergency response organizations, ensure that utility reporting content and point-of-contact information
are built into State and local emergency response plans.

State and local energy assurance plans may not be incorporated into emergency planning, are not
updated, and are not exercised regularly


Incorporate energy emergencies into State and local exercises.
Link energy assurance plans with Emergency Support Function-12 activities to better engage with
industry.21

21

Emergency Support Function (ESF) #12 – Energy is intended to facilitate the restoration of damaged energy systems and components when
activated by the Secretary of Homeland Security for incidents requiring a coordinated Federal response. Under Department of Energy (DOE)
leadership, ESF #12 is an integral part of the larger DOE responsibility of maintaining continuous and reliable energy supplies for the United
States through preventive measures and restoration and recovery actions. http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1825-250459530/emergency_support_function_12_energy_annex_2008.pdf, accessed July 9, 2014.

12



Ensure participation by States in regional exercises conducted by DOE and the National Association of
State Energy Officials (NASEO).



Review and revise the State and local energy assurance plans at least annually and after each energy
emergency to ensure that the plans contain the latest information and best implementation procedures.

Functions, vulnerabilities, and impacts of the loss of electric power on other critical infrastructures
(e.g., water, wastewater, natural gas, petroleum, and communications) are not well understood by
emergency planners and responders


Develop an Interdependency Operational Plan (IOP) and Decision Support Tool (DST) to use in
conjunction with current Emergency Operations Center capabilities. Work with critical infrastructure
owners and operators to obtain necessary information on critical infrastructure assets. Elements to
consider in developing the IOP and DST include (1) protected, methodological data collection; (2)
detailed analysis of asset dependencies and interdependencies; (3) alternative means of providing the
service; and (4) distinct recovery time objectives (RTOs).

FOR ELECTRIC POWER CUSTOMERS
Electrical equipment and backup generators lack protection from natural hazards, accidents, or
sabotage


Identify equipment that is at risk of flooding, surge, accident, or sabotage.



Consider hardening facility-owned electrical equipment and emergency generators against unauthorized
access.



Develop storm surge and flood mitigation plans for at-risk electric equipment and emergency generators;
move at-risk equipment to higher ground.

There is a lack of redundancy in electric power service


Consider requesting redundant service lines that can support the full facility load, are not collocated with
other utility corridors, and are connected to different utility subsystems.



Consult with utility providers, which often have programs to provide expert technical consultation to
determine the best configuration for critical service lines.

Customers have not assessed the electric power dependencies of their core functions and have not
determined the business continuity impacts from the prolonged loss of externally supplied electric
power


Conduct a business impact analysis to ensure that backup generation has sufficient capacity to support
all critical functions (e.g., security systems and communication and IT equipment) simultaneously and
then define the onsite emergency power capability (e.g., safe system shutdown versus full core function
capability versus reduced core function capability).



Conduct a feasibility study to determine required onsite emergency power needs before selecting
generation equipment or incorporating provisions for onsite emergency power generation into business
continuity plans.



Determine the amount of fuel that would need to be stored onsite to allow continued operation of
emergency generation equipment in the event of fuel supply disruptions.

13

Customers may not have contracts in place to ensure continued delivery of fuel needed for onsite
emergency power generation following a major disaster


Review fuel contracts to determine the potential impacts of Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions
provisions under Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-615, as adopted in each State.



For critical lifeline system assets, consider arranging for multiple fuel providers in the event of a
prolonged outage.



Consult with manufacturer of emergency generator equipment to determine its potential to use alternative
fuels (e.g., diesel and natural gas or diesel and jet fuel).

Customers have not tested emergency generators at load to ensure that they will operate as
designed


Conduct scheduled load tests on emergency generators.



Enroll emergency generators in a preventative maintenance program (e.g., through a contracted service).



Ensure that facility personnel are trained in operation of the emergency generation equipment.

Critical infrastructure customers lack emergency planning that includes addressing the loss of
electric power and do not train or exercise this contingency


Develop or amend emergency or business continuity plans to address the long-term loss of electric
power; train personnel in implementing backup equipment and alternate operational procedures; and
finally, exercise plans at least annually.



Investigate contingency plans with electric power providers, including priority service restoration based
on criticality to disaster recovery.



Review electric utility service contracts to confirm that firm electric service is available for critical
functions and understand contractual provisions for the utility’s voluntary reduction options, as well as its
load-shedding priorities.

Critical infrastructure customers lack emergency power capability to improve core function
resilience


Install onsite emergency generators, or consider installing appropriate connections and entering into
contracts for the delivery of portable emergency generators, following an emergency event.



Place emergency generators away from other electrical equipment so that a single event will not impact
both main power and emergency power equipment.



Consider alternatives to emergency generators, including using large equipment with electric generating
capabilities such as railroad locomotives, ships, or even tractors.



Install battery backup systems for safe shutdown to prevent equipment damage from loss of electric
power.



Many electric power providers will provide consultation to determine whether onsite generation
equipment (distributed generation) is feasible and cost-effective; make use of this resource, if it is
available.
