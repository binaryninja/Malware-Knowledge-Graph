Sophos’ Rapid Response team was recently brought in to contain and neutralize an attack
involving Ryuk ransomware. The target was a life sciences research institute that has close
partnerships with local universities and works with students on various programs.
The Ryuk attack cost the institute a week’s worth of vital research data, because although it
had backups, they were not fully up to date. There was further operational impact when all
computer and server files needed to be rebuilt from the ground up before the data could be
restored. Perhaps the hardest lesson of all, however, was discovering that the attack and its
impact could have been avoided with a less trusting and more robust approach to network
access.
After a cyber-incident has been contained, the Rapid Response team uses the logs and
historical data available to retrace the steps taken by the attackers and the tools and
techniques used at every stage. In this instance, the responders found that the adversaries
had gained domain access and used that to deploy the Ryuk ransomware through a series of
scheduled tasks. It was only when they went all the way back to the point of initial access
that they realized it led them out of the corporate network to a single human mistake and
security misjudgement.

Human error can happen in any organization; the reason the mistake was able to progress to
a fully-fledged attack was because the institute didn’t have the protection in place to contain
the error. At the heart of this was its approach to letting people outside the organization
access the network. Students working with the institute use their personal computers to
access the institute’s network. They can connect into the network via remote Citrix sessions
without the need for two factor-authentication.
The institute was exposed the moment one of these external university students apparently
decided they wanted a personal copy of a data visualization software tool they were already
using for work. A single user license was likely to cost them hundreds of dollars a year, so
they posted a question on an online research forum asking if anyone knew of a free
alternative (the Rapid Response team know this because the student handed over their
laptop for analysis once the full extent of the incident became clear).
When the student couldn’t find a suitable free version, they searched for a “Crack” version
instead. They found what appeared to be one and tried to install it. However, the file was in
fact pure malware and the installation attempt immediately triggered a security alert from
Windows Defender. The user disabled Windows Defender – and at the same time appears
have also disabled their firewall – and tried again. This time it worked.
However, instead of a cracked copy of the visualization tool they were after, the student got a
malicious info-stealer that, once installed, began logging keystrokes, stealing browser,
cookies and clipboard data and more. Somewhere along the way it apparently also found the
student’s access credentials for the institute’s network.
Thirteen days later a remote desktop protocol (RDP) connection was registered on the
institute’s network using the student’s credentials. It came from a computer named “Totoro,”
possibly after the anime character.
A feature of RDP is that a connection also triggers the automatic installation of a printer
driver, enabling users to print documents remotely. This allowed the Rapid Response
investigation team to see that the registered RDP connection involved a Russian language
printer driver and was likely to be a rogue connection. Ten days after this connection was
made the Ryuk ransomware was launched.
“It is unlikely that the operators behind the ‘pirated software’ malware are the same as the
ones who launched the Ryuk attack,” said Peter Mackenzie, manager of Rapid Response at
Sophos. “The underground market for previously compromised networks offering attackers
easy initial access is thriving, so we believe that the malware operators sold their access on
to another attacker. The RDP connection could have been the access brokers testing their
access.

“Incident investigations are crucial because they allow us to see how an attack unfolded and
help targets to understand and address security gaps for the future. In this case, the
implementation of robust network authentication and access controls, combined with end
user education might have prevented this attack from happening. It serves as a powerful
reminder of how important it is to get the security basics right.”

Recommendations
Sophos recommends taking the following actions to help defend against network access
abuse:
1. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), where possible, for anyone required to
access internal networks, including external collaborators and partners
2. Have a strong, password policy in place for everyone required to access internal
networks
3. Decommission and/or upgrade any unsupported operating systems and applications
4. Review and install security software on all computers
5. Regularly review and install the latest software patches on all computers – and check
they’ve been installed correctly
6. Review the use of proxy servers and regularly check security policies to prevent access
to malicious websites and/or the downloading of malicious files by anyone on the
network
7. Lock down remote desktop RDP access with static Local Area Network (LAN) rules, via
a group policy or using access control lists
8. Implement segregation for any network access, including for LANs (or consider using
virtual LANs) and where necessary use hardware/software/access control lists
9. Continuously review domain accounts and computers, removing any that are unused or
not needed
10. Review firewall configurations and only whitelist traffic intended for known destinations
11. Limit the use of admin accounts by different users as this encourages credential
sharing that can introduce many other security vulnerabilities
