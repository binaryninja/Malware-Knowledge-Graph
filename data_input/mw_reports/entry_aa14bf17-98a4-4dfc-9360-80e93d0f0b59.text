This month the Lockbit ransomware gang announced their first Bug Bounty program as part
of their evolution into Lockbit 3.0. A first sample of the new version was published by Arda
Büyükkaya. According to their new ransomware wallpaper that appears after encryption, this
specific version has been named ‘Lockbit Black’, which interestingly follows their new
execution method which is pretty similar to the BlackCat ransomware execution method.
There are actually even more similarities between the two ransomwares.

Lockbit Black - Execution
The new Lockbit ransomware requires a “pass” to be supplied as a parameter upon
execution, Similar to BlackCat with requires an “access-token”. The “pass” for the published
sample was also provided by Arda Büyükkaya:

Lockbit Black – Packer and dynamic imports
Lockbit Black is well packed, and its imports table is almost empty. Most API functions calls
are resolved dynamically by calling a trampoline function which decrypts the API function
using XOR encryption:

Lockbit Black – UAC bypass
When executing without Admin privileges, Lockbit Black (much like its previous versions)
performs a CMSTPLUA COM UAC bypass.

Lockbit Black – Service Delete and Process Termination
Lockbit Black enumerates services and processes against a pre-defined “Blacklist”. The new
version however has a much shorter list than its predecessors. The list is effectively a
“Blacklist”, and all services that appear in the list are designated to be either deleted. The

service list of the new version seems like a combined and shorter version of the services that
were previously deleted by Lockbit and BlackCat together and contains:
1. vss
2. sql
3. svc$
4. memtas
5. mepocs
6. msexchange
7. sophos
8. veeam
9. backup
10. GxVss
11. GxBlr
12. GxFWD
13. GxCVD
14. GxCIMgr

The new Lockbit also uses the same method to terminate a number of processes if they are
found to be running on victim’s PC:
1. sql
2. oracle
3. ocssd
4. dbsnmp
5. synctime
6. agntsvc
7. isqlplussvc
8. xfssvccon
9. mydesktopservice

Lockbit Black – Default language check
Previous versions of the Lockbit ransomware performed a default language check on the
system and the current user through the Windows API calls GetSystemDefaultUILanguage
and GetUserDefaultUILanguage. If the language code identifier matched the one specified,
the program shuts down. The new version seems to extend the country list to also include
Syria:

Lockbit Black – Mutex
Lockbit Black creates a “2cae82bd1366f4e0fdc7a9a7c12e2a6b” mutex.

Lockbit Black – New icon, wallpaper and ransom note
Lockbit's Black’s icon, wallpaper and ransom note were updated in the new version:

Figure 7 - Part of the new ransom note
The new ransom note comes in the form of a text file and contains a reference to Elon
Musk’s Twitter (Ilon Musk), but with a link to a more generic #lockbit hashtag page on
Twitter.
There are several chat list URLs added to the link which lead to several Lockbit Darknet
websites.

Lockbit Black – hiding threads from the debugger
Hiding threads from the debugger is not a new behavior for Lockbit but is has increased
usage in the new version. The thread hiding is performed by calling the
NtSetInformationThread API with the undocumented value
THREAD_INFORMATION_CLASS::ThreadHideFromDebugger (0x11):

Lockbit Black –Windows Defender Log tampering
In order to disable Windows Defender logs, Lockbit Black sets
‘HKLMSoftware\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-WindowsWindows Defender/Operational\Enabled’ to ‘0’ as well changing the ‘ChannelAccess’ to
‘(O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0x1;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;LA)’.

Figure 9 - Windows Defender Log Disabled
As in most ransomware cases the encryption is performed by several threads for faster and
efficient work.

Minerva Lockbit 3.0 Prevention of the UAC bypass
Minerva customers don't need to worry, as many of Minerva's modules block Lockbit Black
in its earliest stages, including the UAC Bypass stage, shutting it down completely before the
encryption stage even begins.
