Tracking Jupyter Malware

*Updated March 10, 2022 (Detection rules for new variant observed March 2022.)
I have had the opportunity to track the .NET Backdoor, dubbed by Morphisec as Jupyter
Infostealer A.K.A Solarmarker
I was excited to see this writeup since this was a malware family that myself and other
researchers on twitter were discussing for a couple weeks prior to the Morphisec article,
before there was an attributed name to the malware. This was in October, and we were all
sharing some bits of information we had on this, since that time I have also been using
custom YARA signatures to perform live hunts and retro-hunts in VirusTotal to continue to
keep up on this malware.
Recently I had seen Red Canary wrote up about this, dubbing it Yellow Cockatoo. Again, I
was very excited to see some more attention being paid to this malware, I enjoyed both the
writeups. Red Canary and Morphisec provided excellent information!
Since I've been tracking this for sometime, and commenting on all new samples I see
uploaded to VirusTotal, I figured I would provide some perspective that I have on this
malware as well.
First, the initial access. Red Canary does correctly point out that there is redirecting of
search engine queries, to dig a bit deeper, it appears that this is being done by abusing legit
sites such as sites.google.com and cdn.shopify.com.
The following image is a recent (as of this writing) sample uploaded to VirusTotal. Take note
of 3 things. The first being the file name, the second being the file size, and finally the 3rd
item being the Icon which appears to mimic a Word Document.

In the next screenshot we can see potentially where a users search criteria may lead to this
malware.

Note: I have seen this also on various sites.google.com pages as well with earlier samples.
So, what happens when we go to this link which may potentially lead to the malware?

Now this is interesting right! OK, so when I click on the PDF download, I watched the
Address Bar redirect several times until I was able to get the final malware. Look at the
following screenshots!

What is really interesting is how quickly this 100MB+ file actually downloads! Why is this you
ask? It's because the file appears to be heavily padded (older samples were padded with
NULL Bytes, this latest one is padded with repeating garbage bytes 99 21 C1 FA A3 71 38
9B). Even more interesting is that the malware seems to perform a filesize check, so that if
an analyst attempts to alter the size the malware errors out. If I remove even 1 byte, it errors,
if I add even 1 byte, it errors.... but... if I just flip a bunch of the NULL Bytes and the file size
remains the same, it works fine. Below are acouple interesting screenshots of the padding
and the import of GetFileSize which might be used to see if the file was altered (ie. padding
removed). NOTE: The April 2021 variant appears to have dropped much of the padding,
file sizes are now 16-17MB

6/13

At this point, I feel we have a good sense of the initial vector for this. We know a lot based on
the Red Canary and Morphisec write-ups, we know that the malware drops and launches a
legit program as a red herring in this case Soda PDF, we also know that it drops 2 .txt files in
appdata\local\temp, which are really powershell files. The first one decodes the second one,
then they delete themselves.
This is because they create persistence in the form of a .cmd file (which launches
powershell) it also drops a larger file which is a heavily encoded file that is decoded from the
.cmd file.

7/13

Two other interesting things happen during all of this.... 1, the powershell process connects
to the C2 per the loaded DLL and even more interesting is that is modifies existing desktop
LNK files (shortcuts), keeping the original launch string and then adds an operator to also
launch the .CMD file!

8/13

That's Right! My PEStudio still launches.... along with the malware!
OK, so for a little bit of fun, I'll quickly go over how you can easily decode this malware and
extract the malicious DLL.
First, we modify the .CMD file a bit, comment out or remove the [system.reflection.......] line,
and remove everything before (and including) the bracket {. Save the file as .ps1 for ease.
Next, we put in a line "Write-Output(Variable being loaded from system.reflection) | Out-File
"c:\....."

9/13

At this point, this is simple encoding. I've been using CyberChef "From CharCode", Delimiter
"Line Feed" "Base 10" to quickly get the DLL at this point.

Hopefully this helps provide some additional details on this malware, below are the IOCs for
this specific example. Happy Hunting!
