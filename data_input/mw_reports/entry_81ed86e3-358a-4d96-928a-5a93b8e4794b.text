Executive Summary
Unit 42 researchers recently published on activity by the Hangover threat group (aka Neon,
Viceroy Tiger, MONSOON) carrying out targeted cyberattacks deploying BackConfig
malware attacks against government and military organizations in South Asia. As a result,
we’ve created this threat assessment report for the Hangover Group’s activities. The
techniques and campaigns can be visualized using the Unit 42 Playbook Viewer.
Hangover Group is a cyberespionage group that was first observed in December 2013
carrying on a cyberattack against a telecom corporation in Norway. Cybersecurity firm
Norman reported that the cyberattacks were emerging from India and the group sought and
carried on attacks against targets of national interest, such as Pakistan and China. However,

there have been indicators of Hangover activity in the U.S. and Europe. Mainly focusing on
government, military, and civilian organizations. The Hangover Group's initial vector of
compromise is to carry out spear-phishing campaigns. The group uses local and topical
news lures from the South Asia region to make their victims more prone to falling into their
social engineering techniques, making them download and execute a weaponized Microsoft
Office document. After the user executes the weaponized document, backdoor
communication is established between BackConfig and the threat actors, allowing attackers
to carry on espionage activity, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data from compromised
systems.
Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention platform with WildFire, DNS Security and Cortex XDR
detects activity associated with this threat group. Customers can also review activity
associated with this Threat Assessment using AutoFocus with the following tags: Hangover
and BackConfig.

Table 1. Courses of Action for Hangover Group
†These capabilities are part of the NGFW security subscriptions service

Conclusion
The Hangover Group is active and, according to Unit 42 visibility, is targeting government
and military organizations in South Asia.
The group continues to make use of compromised, third-party infrastructure to support the
delivery of their weaponized documents, using spear-phishing emails containing links to said
sites.
The delivery documents continue to evolve and, over the years, have moved from plain text
code and URLs to encoded. From storing encoded executables within the documents, to
using ZIP files - including a package of files - to finally downloading executables from
command and control servers.
The installation of the BackConfig malware by the delivery documents is performed using
multiple stages and components, most likely to evade sandboxes or other automated
analysis and detection systems. This includes the use of Virtualization-based Security (VBS),
batch codes, scheduled tasks, and conditional trigger files.
Once fully installed, the BackConfig malware communicates with the threat actors using
HTTPS making visibility and detection potentially more difficult, and blends in amongst other
similar traffic.
17/18

Once an infected system is under an actor’s control, the objective varies on the plugins
deployed and the type of system or organization compromised.
