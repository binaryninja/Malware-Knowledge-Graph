Mandiant information operations Threat Intelligence analysis
In June 2019, Mandiant Threat Intelligence first reported to customers a pro-People’s
Republic of China (PRC) network of hundreds of inauthentic accounts on Twitter,
Facebook, and YouTube, that was at that time primarily focused on discrediting prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong. Since then, the broader activity set has rapidly
expanded in size and scope and received widespread public attention following Twitter’s
takedown of related accounts in August 2019. Numerous other researchers have
published investigations into various aspects of this activity set, including Google’s Threat
Analysis Group, Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Stanford Internet
Observatory and the Hoover Institution, and the Centre for Information Resilience.
Since we began tracking the campaign in mid-2019, we have observed multiple shifts in
its tactics, many of which have been reported on publicly elsewhere, including the use of
artificially generated photos for account profile pictures and the promotion of a wide
variety of narrative themes related to current events, including multiple narratives related
to the COVID-19 pandemic, narratives critical of Chinese dissident Guo Wengui and his
associates, and narratives related to domestic U.S. political issues. However, other
evolutions in the network’s activity do not appear to have been reported widely, and our
aim with this blog post is to provide early warning of two significant developments that
we believe are important to monitor despite the limited impact of the network so far:
The scope of activity, in terms of languages and platforms used, is far
broader than previously understood. Most reporting has highlighted English
and Chinese-language activity occurring on the social media giants Facebook,
Twitter, and YouTube. However, we have now observed this pro-PRC activity taking
place on 30 social media platforms and over 40 additional websites and niche
forums, and in additional languages including Russian, German, Spanish, Korean,
and Japanese. While some platforms have hosted hundreds or thousands of
accounts in the network, other platforms have hosted a smaller number.
Collectively, these observations suggest the actors behind this campaign have
significantly expanded their online footprint and appear to be attempting to
establish a presence on as many platforms as possible to reach a variety of global
audiences.

Accounts in the network have actively sought to physically mobilize
protestors in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though we
have seen no indication that these attempts motivated any real-world
activity. While previous public reporting has highlighted limited instances of
organic engagement with the network on Twitter and we have continued to track
similar instances of organic engagement on both social media and niche online
forums, this direct call for physical mobilization is a significant development
compared to prior activity, potentially indicative of an emerging intent to motivate
real-world activity outside of China’s territories. While this attempt did not appear
to achieve any success, we believe it is critical that observers continue to monitor for
such attempts in case greater degrees of organic engagement are later realized by
the network.
Activity Expands to Dozens of Social Media Platforms, Websites, and Forums in at
Least Seven Languages
Similar to previously reported activity that has spanned Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube,
we have observed coordination between suspected accounts in the network across 30
social media platforms and over 40 other websites and online forums. These accounts
have posted similar, and in many cases identical messaging and engaged in the
coordinated sharing, commenting on, and liking of text, image, and video content. For
example:
We have observed thousands of identical text posts, images, and videos promoted
by accounts on Vimeo, Vkontakte, TikTok, and a number of other platforms
claiming that Chinese dissident Guo Wengui, former White House Chief Strategist
Steve Bannon, and Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan are “liars” in response to Dr.
Yan’s Claim that the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab (Figure 1). Videos
featured characteristics typical of those promoted by the network historically,
including Chinese and automated English-language voiceovers.
In some instances, accounts on one platform have directly provided their
corresponding social media handles on other platforms in their bios. For example,
we have observed accounts on LiveJournal posting in Russian, English, and German
provide handles for corresponding Twitter accounts that all posted in English
(Figure 2). Different accounts across different platforms have also appropriated the
same profile photos, including photos of models and stock photography (Figure 3).
We also observed instances of forum posts linking to other accounts in the network
(Figure 4).

Figure 4: A forum post links to a Twitter account in the network
We have observed extensive promotion of Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and
Japanese-language content on U.S. and non-U.S.-based platforms, in addition to the
typical English and Chinese-language activity that has been widely reported on. This
represents a significant development in our collective understanding of this pro-PRC
activity set. For example:
We observed Russian-language posts on LiveJournal claim that U.S. Ft. Detrick was
the source of the coronavirus and that China was “not the source” of the virus, a
long-promoted and extensively reported narrative of this activity set that has also
been promoted by Chinese state-run media outlets since early 2020 (Figure 5).
Additionally, we have observed Russian-language posts on both LiveJournal and
VKontakte by accounts we have tied to the network cite unconfirmed studies to
claim COVID-19 may have appeared in the U.S. as early as December 2019.
We have observed several instances of multiple inauthentic VKontakte accounts
reposting Russian translations of posts by what appear to be authentic Englishlanguage Twitter accounts belonging to individuals who claim to have contracted
COVID-19 in late 2019 in the U.S. and other locations outside China (Figure 6). We
also observed a small number of Russian-language posts by VKontakte accounts in
the network state that Taiwan and Hong Kong are Chinese territories.
We observed German and Spanish-language content on LiveJournal and the
Argentine social media site Taringa that also attempted to cast doubt about the
origins of COVID-19. Posts in German on LiveJournal cited unconfirmed studies to
claim that COVID-19 may have appeared in the U.S. before January 2020, while
posts in Spanish on Taringa claimed that U.S. Ft. Detrick was the source of COVID19 and linked to third-party articles that claimed that the virus appeared in the U.S.
and Europe before China (Figures 7 and 8).

Notably, some of the Russian and German-language posts we observed contained
recurring grammatical errors, a limited indication that they may have been
authored by non-native speakers of those languages. For example, we observed
Russian-language LiveJournal posts by accounts purportedly operated by female
bloggers use a masculine-tense verb for the phrase "Я увидел" (Translation: "I
saw"), which should read "увидела" if written by a female Russian speaker (Figure
9).

Detrick was the source of COVID-19" and that "China is not the source of the virus"

Attempts to Physically Mobilize Protestors in the U.S.
In April 2021, thousands of posts in languages including English, Japanese, and Korean,
images, and videos were posted across multiple platforms by accounts we assess to be
part of this broader activity set that called on Asian Americans to protest racial injustices
in the U.S. (Figure 10). The accounts specifically called on Asian Americans to protest on
April 24 in New York City and “fight back” against the purported “rumors” caused by Dr.
Li-Meng Yan, Guo Wengui, and Steve Bannon, and in some instances provided an
address that they claimed Guo lived at.

Figure 10: Twitter account calls for physical protests in Japanese (left), Korean (middle),
and English (right) (Note: We have censored the address listed by the accounts)
Subsequently, we observed posts by accounts in the network portray the advocated April
24 New York City protest as a success, claiming that Asian Americans, other minority
groups, and Caucasian protestors attended (Figure 11). Other posts claimed that these
protesters were met by Guo Wengui’s “supporters”, who “violently assault[ed]” them. As
part of this claim of success, we observed a manipulated image in which the face of Dr.
Yan was superimposed onto a sign held by a purported protestor and shared across nearly
all the social media platforms and forums that we have seen leveraged as part of this
broader activity set. We identified the image to be a manipulation of a picture taken at a
rally against racial discrimination that took place in Jamestown, NY, on or around April
23, 2021 (Figure 12).

Despite these claims, we have not observed any evidence to suggest that these calls were
successful in mobilizing protestors on April 24. However, it does provide early warning
that the actors behind the activity may be starting to explore, in however limited a
fashion, more direct means of influencing the domestic affairs of the U.S. We believe it is
important to call attention to such attempts and for observers to continue to monitor for
such attempts in future.
Conclusion
Our aim with this blog post is to provide early warning of two significant developments
that we believe are important to monitor for despite the limited impact of this pro-PRC
campaign thus far. First, the activity is taking place not just on the big three social media
giants, but on at least 30 social media platforms and dozens of additional websites and
forums, and in languages including not just English and Chinese, but also German,
Russian, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese. This suggests that the actors behind the
campaign have significantly expanded their online footprint and appear to be attempting
to establish a presence on as many platforms as possible to reach a variety of global
audiences. Second, the attempt to physically mobilize protesters in the U.S. provides early
warning that the actors responsible may be starting to explore more direct means of
influence and may be indicative of an emerging intent to motivate real-world activity
outside of China’s territories.
