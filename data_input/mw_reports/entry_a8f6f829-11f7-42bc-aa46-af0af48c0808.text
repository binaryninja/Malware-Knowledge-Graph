A New Trojan in Town: Meet Zberp
Trusteer researchers recently discovered a new Trojan that has been targeting more than
450 financial institutions around the world, mainly in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. The new
Trojan, which seems to be a variant of the well-known Zeus Trojan (a.k.a. Zbot), also
demonstrates behaviors associated with the Carberp Trojan family. Therefore, we named it
the Zberp Trojan.
According to an analysis conducted by Trusteer researchers Martin G. Korman and Tal
Darsan, the Trojan seems to have been assembled from the leaked source code of two wellknown Trojans: Zeus and Carberp. The Zeus source code was exposed to the public in 2011,
and it is already used by some criminal groups that customize its behavior and develop new
features. The Carberp source code was offered for sale last year.
“Since the source code of the Carberp Trojan was leaked to the public, we had a theory that
it won’t take cyber criminals too long to combine the Carberp source code with the Zeus
code and create an evil monster,” explained Korman and Darsan. “It was only a theory, but a
few weeks ago we found samples of the ‘Andromeda’ botnet that were downloading the
hybrid beast.”
The new Zberp Trojan, a variant of the Zeus VM Trojan, enables cyber criminals to grab
basic information about the infected computer, including the Computer name, IP and more. It
can take screen shots and send them to the attacker. It steals data submitted in HTTP forms,
user SSL certificates and even FTP and POP account credentials. The Zberp Trojan also
includes optional features that enable Web injections, dynamic Web injections, MITB/MITM
attacks and VNC/RDP connections.
In addition to its malicious capabilities, the Zberp Trojan uses a combination of evasion
techniques that it inherited from both the Zeus and the Carberp Trojans.
Zberp uses an “invisible persistence” feature that is has been used by the Zeus VM variant:
the malware deletes its persistence key from the registry during the Windows startup process
to prevent security solutions from detecting it during normal system scans that take place
after the system boots. To ensure persistency, however, the malware rewrites the persistence
key back to the registry during system shutdown.
The Trojan also disguises the configuration code in an image file through steganography, a
technique used by malware authors to embed code in a file format that looks legitimate and
bypasses malware detection solutions.

The Carberp source code contribution to the Zberp Trojan can be seen in its “hooking”
technique, commonly used by malware developers to control the browser, grab key strokes
and steal information. It also keeps the malware “invisible,” evading detection by anti-virus
and anti-malware tools.

The figure below shows that the hook is implemented in the same place, but its
implementation is slightly different: The push instruction highlighted in the Carberp code (on
the left) was changed by one byte in the Zberp code (on the right), and a ‘mov’ instruction
was added to it. These changes ensure that even security solutions capable of detecting
Carberp variants will not identify the new code.

Another evasion technique that has been embedded in the Zberp Trojan is the use of SSL,
which secures the communications with the Command and Control server and evades
detection by network security products.
According to a Virus-Total scan, the Zberp Trojan was able to evade most anti-virus solutions
when it was first detected. Trusteer’s endpoint protection solutions, which do not require prior
knowledge about emerging threats in order to stop them, detected and removed the Zberp
Trojan immediately — on ‘day zero.’
