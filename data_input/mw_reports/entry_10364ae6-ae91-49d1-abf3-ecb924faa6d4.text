Game developer and publisher Crytek has confirmed that the Egregor ransomware gang
breached its network in October 2020, encrypting systems and stealing files containing
customers' personal info later leaked on the gang's dark web leak site.
The company acknowledged the attack in breach notification letters sent to impacted
individuals earlier this month and shared by one of the victims with BleepingComputer
today.
"We want to inform you that Crytek was the victim of a ransomware attack by some
unknown cyber-criminals," Crytek said in a letter mailed to one of their customers impacted
in the incident.

"During that attack certain data had been encrypted and stolen from our network. We took
immediate action to prevent the encrypton of our systems, further secure our environment,
and initiate an internal and external investigation into the incident.
Crytek confirmed that Egregor operators later leaked documents stolen during the incident
on their data leak site.
"Based on our investigation, the information in some case included individuals' first and last
name, job title, company name, email, business address, phone number and country,"
Crytek revealed.

Data breach impact downplayed
The game developer tried to reassure affected customers by saying "the website itself was
difficult to identify [..], so that in our estimation, only very few people will have taken note of
it."
Crytek added downloading the leaked data would've also taken too long, which would have
also likely represented a significant hurdle that stopped people from trying to grab it.
Crytek also believes that those who attempted downloading the stolen data were
discouraged by the "huge risk" of compromising their systems with malware embedded in
the leaked documents.

While these points would make sense for individuals with little to no experience in using
computers, most people who would want and know how to get their hands on this type of
data would likely use downloaders and open the leaked files in a virtual machine.
Furthermore, threat actors commonly download files leaked on ransomware data leaks to
sell or share with other cybercriminals.
Considering this, Crytek's attempts to downplay the seriousness of the data breach
resulting from the October 2020 ransomware attack don't hold water.
"While we are not aware of misues of any information potentially impacted, we are providing
this notice as part of our precautions," Crytek added.

As BleepingComputer reported in October, Crytek's systems were hit by Egregor
ransomware in an attack confirmed by sources familiar with the incident.
While we were not told how many Crytek systems were encrypted in the attack, we were
told that files were encrypted and renamed to include the '.CRYTEK' extension.
The stolen data leaked by Egregor on their data leak site included:
Files related to WarFace
Crytek's canceled Arena of Fate MOBA game
Documents with information on their network operations
Other well-known companies and organizations worldwide attacked by Egregor in the past
include Barnes and Noble, Kmart, Cencosud, Randstad, and Vancouver's TransLink metro
system.

Egregor affiliates arrested in Ukraine
In February 2021, several members of the Egregor ransomware operation were arrested in
Ukraine following a joint operation between French and Ukrainian law enforcement.
Law enforcement officers made the arrests after French authorities could trace ransom
payments to individuals located in Ukraine.
The arrested individuals are believed to be Egregor affiliates whose job was to hack into
corporate networks and deploy the ransomware.
Egregor launched in September 2020, right after the Maze ransomware gang began
shutting down its operation.
At the time, BleepingComputer was told by threat actors that Maze's affiliates switched to
Egregor's RaaS, allowing the new RaaS to launch with experienced and skilled hackers.
Egregor operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) where the ransomware developers
partner with affiliates who conduct the attacks, splitting the ransom payments.
As part of this arrangement, the core team earns between 20-30% of all paid ransoms,
while affiliates pocketed the other 70-80%.

Cybersecurity firm Kivu said in a February report that Egregor has 10-12 core members and
20-25 semi-exclusively vetted members, and it amassed over 200 victims since its
September launch.
A Crytek spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by
BleepingComputer earlier today or after our initial report from October 2020.
