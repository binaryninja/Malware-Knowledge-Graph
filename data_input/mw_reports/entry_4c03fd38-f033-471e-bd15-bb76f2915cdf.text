Jordanian publishing and research house, Dar El-Jaleel. This institute is known for
Careerstheir research of the Palestinian-Israeli

Sunni-Shia con ict within Iran.
The attacker extensively used scripting
languages (VBScript, PowerShell, VBA) as part
MBR Filter
Blog of their attack. These scripts are used to dynamically load and execute VBScript
functions retrieved from a Command
FIRST& Control server.
The attacker demonstrates excellent operational security (OPSEC). The attacker was
LockyDump
particularly careful to camou age
their infrastructure. During our investigation, the
attacker deployed several reconnaissance scripts in order to check the validity of
FreeSentry
victim machine, blocking systems that don't meet their criteria. The attacker uses the
reputable CloudFlare system to hide the nature and location of their infrastructure.
Flokibot Tools
Additionally, the attacker lters connections based on their User-Agent strings, and
only enables their infrastructure for short periods of time before blocking all
Synful Knock Scanner
connections.

This is not the rst targeted campaign against the region that uses Dar El-Jaleel decoy

documents which we have investigated.
However, we have no indication that the previous
campaigns are related.

Additional Payloads

LockyDump

The WSF script receives payloads of three
types, named s0, s1, s2. The payloads are VBScript

functions loaded and executed on the y with the ExecuteGlobal() and GetRef() APIs. The only
differences between s0,s1 and s2 typeFlokibot
payloads
are the number of arguments supplied to the

The downloaded payload functions are obfuscated, here is an example of the raw data:

The rst element is the function type (s0), followed by a separator '-|-'. The second element is the

The purpose of this script is to download shellcode from 176[.]107[.]185[.]246 IP, to map it in

takes many precautions before delivering the shellcode,
these will be explained in the next chapter. Unfortunately during our investigation we weren't

The attacker behind this campaign putMutiny
a lot ofFuzzer
effort into protecting its infrastructure and to avoid
leaking code to analysts. The rst Command & Control server is protected by CloudFlare. This
choice complicates the analysis and tracking of the campaign. Additionally, the attacker lters on
the User-Agent; if your web requests do not t a speci c pattern, your request will be ignored.
During our analysis the attacker was only active during the morning (Central European

Links with Jenxcus (a.k.a. Houdini/H-Worm)?
File2pcap
If you are familiar with Jenxcus (a.k.a. Houdini/H-Worm) you should see some similarities

between the VBScript used during this campaign and this well-known malware: usage of the
Decept
user-agent to ex ltrate data, reconnaissance techniques etc…
Mutiny Fuzzer
We cannot tell if the attacker used a new version of Jenxcus or if this malware served as the

inspiration for their own malicious code. The source code of Jenxcus can be easily found on the
Internet. However, the adaptation used in this campaign is more advanced: the
features/functions are loaded on demand and the initial script does not include all the malicious
code unlike Jenxcus.

Additional Targets
We can identify different targets based on the User-Agent used by the attacker to identify victims.
