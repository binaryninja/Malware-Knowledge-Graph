Following Google TAG announcement that a few profiles on twitter, were part of an APT
campaign targeting security Researchers. According to Google TAG, these threat actors are
North Koreans and they had multiple goals of establishing credibility by publishing a well
thought of blog posts as well as interacting with researchers via Direct Messages and lure
them to download and run an infected Visual Studio project.

Some of the fake profiles were: @z0x55g, @james0x40, @br0vvnn, @BrownSec3Labs

Using a Chrome 0day to infect clients?
In their post, Google TAG, mentioned that the attackers were able to pop a fully patched
Windows box running Chrome.
From Googleâ€™s post:

In addition to targeting users via social engineering, we have also observed several
cases where researchers have been compromised after visiting the actorsâ€™ blog. In
each of these cases, the researchers have followed a link on Twitter to a write-up
hosted on blog.br0vvnn[.]io, and shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on
the researcherâ€™s system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an
actor-owned command and control server. At the time of these visits, the victim
systems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser
versions.

Attacking Mobile Users?
According to ZecOps Mobile Threat Intelligence, the same threat actor might have used an
Android 0day too.
