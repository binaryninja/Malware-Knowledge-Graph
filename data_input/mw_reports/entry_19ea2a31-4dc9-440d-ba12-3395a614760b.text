For months, we at Yoroi Malware ZLab have studied and tracked the evolution of a new
emerging cyber-criminal group which has attracted the attention of everyone inside the cyber
security threat landscape. This threat actor calls itself “Eternity Group”, previously “Jester
Group”, which we internally tracked it as “TH-320”.
This threat has also recently been involved in a cyber-attack against Ukraine, this attack
proves that any threat should not be underestimated and could be used and evolve to
sabotage critical infrastructures benefiting state-sponsored groups. In the following flashcard
we classified the TTPs to summarize the capabilities of this threat:

Lilith Botnet, the “all in one” solution provided by the Eternity Group
Eternity Worm, capable to propagate in different ways
