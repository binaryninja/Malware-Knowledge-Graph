Summary
Since 2016, an advanced threat group that Cisco Talos is tracking has carried out
cyberattacks against South Korea and Japan. This group is known by several different
names: Tick, Redbaldknight and Bronze Butler.
Although each campaign employed custom tools, Talos has observed recurring patterns in
the actor's use of infrastructure, from overlaps in hijacked command and control (C2)
domains to differing campaign C2s resolving to the same IP. These infrastructure patterns
indicate similarities between the Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi malware families. In
this post, we will dive into these parallels and examine the methods used by this actor.

Introduction
The APT threat actor known as "Tick," "Bronze Butler," and "Redbaldknight" has conducted
espionage campaigns since 2016 against East Asian countries such as Japan and South
Korea [1]. Talos analyzed a recent campaign in which compromised websites located in
South Korea and Japan were used as C2 servers for samples belonging to the malware
family known as "Datper," which has the ability to execute shell commands on the victim
machine and obtain hostnames and drive information. Talos found potential links in
shared infrastructure between the malware families Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi,
each of which has been attributed to this threat actor under one of the above three aliases.
We obtained this Datper variant through VirusTotal. The sample, written in Delphi code,
was submitted toward the end of July 2018. Although the exact attack vector is unclear,
the threat actor appears to have selected a legitimate-but-vulnerable Korean laundry
service website to host their C2, shown below.

Legitimate Korean laundry site used as Datper C2 host.
The website, located at whitepia[.]co.kr, does not use SSL encryption or certificates. The
specific URL used for C2 communication is:
hxxp://whitepia[.]co[.]kr/bbs/include/JavaScript.php
Once executed, the Datper variant creates a mutex object called "gyusbaihysezhrj" and
retrieves several pieces of information from the victim machine, including system
information and keyboard layout. Afterward, the sample attempts to issue an HTTP GET
request to the above C2 server, which at the time of this writing, resolved to the IP
111[.]92[.]189[.]19.
An example of this request is:
GET /bbs/include/JavaScript.php?ycmt=de4fd712fa7e104f1apvdogtw HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko
Host: whitepia[.]co.kr
Cache-Control: no-cache
Unfortunately, at the time of this investigation, the C2 server was unavailable, preventing
Talos from investigating C2 communications in greater detail. However, Talos was able to
analyze a previous campaign from 2017, which employed a similar sample from this
family and used a slightly different mutex, "d4fy3ykdk2ddssr." All samples in the diagram
below, associated with the 2017 campaign, implemented mutex object "d4fy3ykdk2ddssr,"
likely to prevent access from other processes during execution.

Structure of C2 communications from the 2017 campaign.
The actor behind this campaign deployed and managed their C2 infrastructure mainly in
South Korea and Japan. We confirmed that the actor periodically changed their C2
infrastructure and appears to have a history of identifying and penetrating vulnerable
websites located in these countries. In addition to whitepia[.]co[.]kr, we identified other
instances of compromised websites used as C2 servers. It is possible the malware
samples are being delivered using web-based attacks, such as drive-by downloads or
watering hole attacks. Additionally, Talos identified hosts used as C2 servers that may not
be connected to a compromised website. This indicates the possibility that the threat
actor may have initially deployed their C2 server infrastructure on legitimately obtained
(and potentially purchased) hosts.
Overlaps in the compromised websites used as C2 domains suggest links to another
malware family known as "xxmm backdoor" (or alternatively, "Murim" or "Wrim"), a
malware family that allows an attacker to install additional malware. The GET request URI
paths of xxmm backdoor and Datper are similar, as seen below:
xxmm backdoor: hxxp://www.amamihanahana.com/diary/archives/a_/2/index.php
Datper: hxxp://www.amamihanahana.com/contact/contact_php/jcode/set.html
Based on the findings above, both tools have used the same websites located in Japan in
their C2 infrastructure since 2016.
The xxmm sample, shown on the right-hand side of the diagram above, has the hash
397a5e9dc469ff316c2942ba4b503ff9784f2e84e37ce5d234a87762e0077e25 [2].
The extracted PDB debug symbol paths from the sample are:

C:\Users\123\Desktop\xxmm3\x64\Release\ReflectivLoader.pdb
In addition to the links between Datper and xxmm backdoor, a recent Datper variant
compiled in March 2018 used a legitimate website as a C2, which resolved to the IP
211[.]13[.]196[.]164. This same IP was used as C2 infrastructure by the Emdivi malware
family — a trojan that opens a backdoor on the compromised machine — and was
attributed to the threat actor behind the campaign "Blue termite" [3].

Structure of 2018 Datper and Emdivi campaigns.
Our passive DNS lookup data of Resource Records (RR) for domains used by Datper and
Emdivi further suggest that this IP was used by both malware families.

Conclusion
Talos' investigation into attacks conducted by this actor indicates commonalities between
the Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi malware families. Specifically, these similarities
are in the C2 infrastructure of attacks utilizing these malware families. Some C2 domains

used in these attacks resolve to hijacked, legitimate South Korean and Japanese hosts
and may have been purchased by the attacker. Successful attacks utilizing these malware
families may result in shell commands being run on victim machines, resulting in a
potential leak of sensitive information. Cisco security products protect our customers in a
