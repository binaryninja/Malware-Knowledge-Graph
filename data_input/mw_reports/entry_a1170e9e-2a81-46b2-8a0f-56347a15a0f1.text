Responding to Solarigate

December 14, 2020

As you are no doubt aware, on Sunday the security software provider SolarWinds
announced that installers for it’s Orion monitoring platform had been backdoored by “a
nation-state”. Typical customers of SolarWinds are enterprise scale and security conscious.
Reported organisations compromised through these attacks include various parts of the US
government, as well as a number of large organisations in the private sector.
Below we have included some suggestions for those responding to these incidents or
performing forensics to confirm if they may be compromised.
Background

Reviewing the backdoored Orion installers, they match what appears to be SolarWind’s
normal build process. It is likely the attackers have compromised both the SolarWind source
code, and their build process to deliver backdoored updates through their normal release
process.
The first backdoored installers identified so far date back to October 2019, though
SolarWinds themselves have only referred to backdoored installers starting in May 2020.

On Sunday 13th December 2020, SolarWinds sent an email to customers informing them of
the situation:

Backdoored Orion Installers

A number of backdoored installers have been identified, and are still being served from the
SolarWinds website. Below is a non-exhaustive list of the installers:

SunBurst/Solorigate Backdoor
The file CoreInstaller.msi/OrionCore.cab/SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is what
FireEye calls SunBurst and Microsoft calls Solorigate. SunBurst performs the typical firststage backdoor tasks of downloading and executing files, whilst subtly evading detection.
SunBurst deploys basic Base64 encoding to hide key strings such as the command and
control protocol:

And impersonates normal Orion network traffic to blend in:

A detailed analysis of SunBurst is available in the FireEye report, and we have included the
de-obfuscated source-code in Appendix B to save others having to do perform the same deobfuscation.
Later Stages of the Attack
Both Microsoft and FireEye have provided details of second stages of the attacks they have
identified, including malware:
4/7

SuperNova – A .NET Web shell
CosmicGale – A Powershell credential theft script
TearDrop – A memory resident dropper
Cobalt Strike – A commercially available backdoor, observed dropped by TearDrop
And also attacker activity such as:
Adding new federation trusts. Microsoft recently added new detections for Modified
domain federation trust settings likely to hunt for this activity.
Adding OAuth credentials to Exchange
Suggestions for Forensic Analysis
The Department of Homeland security advises agencies with SolarWinds installations, and
the required expertise, to perform a full forensic investigation:
a. Forensically image system memory and/or host operating systems hosting all instances of
SolarWinds Orion versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1]. Analyze for new user or service
accounts, privileged or otherwise.
b. Analyze stored network traffic for indications of compromise, including new external DNS
domains to which a small number of agency hosts (e.g., SolarWinds systems) have had
connections.
Pay attention to Windows event logs with:
Sysmon Event IDs 17 and 18 relating to named pipes
Security Event ID 7045 relating to service creation, and 4702 relating to the creation of
a scheduled task
Windows Exploit Guard event ID 12, relating to a non-Microsoft-signed binary being
blocked from loading
Microsoft provides guidance on how to enable increased logging of AD FS (Active
Directory Federation Services).
Look for the existence of the following file:
C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\netsetupsvc.dll
(**note the normal legitimate path for this file-name is within C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32):
Additional mitigation considerations:
It is strongly suggested where practical, that sensitive systems, or systems that imply a
third party risk be monitored and audited regularly.

5/7

We suggest where possible servers should allow whitelisted internet access only. For
example, if your SolarWinds server was only allowed to access the necessary IP
addresses, and or IP ranges for its function. It would help prevent communication to
unknown command and control infrastructure.
Always utlise the concept of least privileged access, and look to monitor account usage
that is beyond its normal purpose or operation. For example, a service account
performing an interactive logon or querying other services that have no relation to the
accounts purposes.
