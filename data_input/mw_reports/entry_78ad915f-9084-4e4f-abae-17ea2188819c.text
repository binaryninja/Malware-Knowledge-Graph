A day after US President Joe Biden said the US plans to disrupt the hackers behind the
Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, the operator of the Darkside ransomware said the group lost
control of its web servers and some of the funds it made from ransom payments.
“A few hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, namely: Blog.
Payment server. CDN servers,” said Darksupp, the operator of the Darkside ransomware, in
a post spotted by Recorded Future threat intelligence analyst Dmitry Smilyanets.
“Now these servers are unavailable via SSH, and the hosting panels are blocked,” said the
Darkside operator while also complaining that the web hosting provider refused to cooperate.
In addition, the Darkside operator also reported that cryptocurrency funds were also
withdrawn from the gang’s payment server, which was hosting ransom payments made by
victims.
The funds, which the Darkside gang was supposed to split between itself and its affiliates
(the threat actors who breach networks and deploy the ransomware), were transferred to an
unknown wallet, Darksupp said.

Takedown?
This sudden development comes after US authorities announced their intention to go after
the gang.
In two conferences this week, on Monday and Thursday, US President Biden himself came
out and said the US would go after the group after one of its attacks crippled a major fuel
transport pipeline that impacted half of the US East Coast, leading the US to declare a state
of national emergency in order to ensure gasoline was delivered to impacted regions.
“We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible
countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,” President Biden said
in a press conference on Thursday.
“We are also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate,” he added [see

was involved in this attack—but we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals
who did the attack are living in Russia." https://t.co/CAHmsNFmcf

President Biden’s statement also came after Bill Evanina, former Director of the US National
Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), also said last week that the US intelligence
community was very likely respond to respond to the brazen Colonial attack in a disruptive
manner.
Darkside attribution is a good move by the FBI. I fully expect Darkside to shortly
experience the full extent of IC and DoD precision tactical deterrent capabilities.

Or exit scam?
But Smilyanets warns that the group’s announcement could also be a ruse, as no
announcement has yet been made by US officials.
The group could be taking advantage of President Biden’s statements as cover to shut down
its infrastructure and run away with its affiliate’s money without paying their cuts—a tactic
known as an “exit scam” on the cybercriminal underground.

According to #REvil #ransomware operator Unknown (possible false flag), #DarkSide –
No More. Servers are seized. Money is gone
— 𝕯𝖒𝖎𝖙𝖗𝖞 𝕾𝖒𝖎𝖑𝖞𝖆𝖓𝖊𝖙𝖘 (@ddd1ms) May 14, 2021
Reached out for comment, a spokesperson for the Justice Department said the department
does not comment on active investigations and could not confirm a coordinated action from
any US entity.

REvil and Avaddon gangs announce changes too
But it’s been a busy past 24 hours for ransomware gangs.
The news that Darkside lost control of its servers and that a major cybercrime forum was
banning ransomware ads, all happening within a span of hours of each other, also had an
effect on REvil, arguably considered today’s biggest ransomware operation.
In a post quoting Darkside’s (now-deleted) statement, REvil spokesperson Unknown made
an announcement of their own and said they also plan to stop advertising their Ransomwareas-a-Service platform and “go private”—a term used by cybercrime gangs to describe their
intention to work with a small group of known and trusted collaborators only.
Additionally, the REvil group also said that it plans to stop attacking sensitive social sectors
like healthcare, educational institutes, and the government networks of any country, which it
believes could draw unwanted attention to its operation, such as the attention Darkside is
getting right now.
In the case of any of such attacks carried out by any of its collaborators, REvil said they plan
to provide a free decryption key to victims and stop working with the misbehaving affiliate.

Furthermore, hours after REvil’s announcement, the operators of the Avaddon ransomware
also announced similar updates to their program, with the same clause barring ransomware
groups from attacking government entities, healthcare orgs, and educational institutes.
While we may never know who or what is driving these changes among ransomware gangs,
it is pretty clear that the Colonial Pipeline attack and its aftermath appears to have broken
the camel’s back, and US authorities have started applying some sort of pressure on these
groups.
