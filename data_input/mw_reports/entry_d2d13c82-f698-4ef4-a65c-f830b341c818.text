Taking Action Against Hackers in Bangladesh and
Vietnam

April 7, 2022

Today, we’re sharing actions we took against two separate groups of hackers — APT32 in
Vietnam and a group based in Bangladesh — removing their ability to use their infrastructure
to abuse our platform, distribute malware and hack people’s accounts across the internet.
Facebook’s threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide
range of threats including malware campaigns, influence operations and hacking of our
platform or individual Facebook accounts by nation state adversaries, hackers and others.
As part of these efforts, our teams routinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them,
notifying users if they should take steps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings
publicly and continuing to improve the security of our products.
Today we’re sharing our latest research and enforcement actions against attempts to
compromise people’s accounts and gain access to their information, commonly referred to as
cyber espionage. These two unconnected groups targeted people on our platform and
elsewhere on the internet using very different tactics. The operation from Vietnam focused
primarily on spreading malware to its targets, whereas the operation from Bangladesh
focused on compromising accounts across platforms and coordinating reporting to get
targeted accounts and Pages removed from Facebook.

The people behind these operations are persistent adversaries, and we expect them to
evolve their tactics. However, our detection systems and threat investigators, as well as other
teams in the security community, keep improving to make it harder for them to remain
undetected. We will continue to share our findings whenever possible so people are aware of
the threats we are seeing and can take steps to strengthen the security of their accounts.

Here’s What We Found
Bangladesh
The Bangladesh-based group targeted local activists, journalists and religious minorities,
including those living abroad, to compromise their accounts and have some of them disabled
by Facebook for violating our Community Standards. Our investigation linked this activity to
two non-profit organizations in Bangladesh: Don’s Team (also known as Defense of Nation)
and the Crime Research and Analysis Foundation (CRAF). They appeared to be operating
across a number of internet services.
Don’s Team and CRAF collaborated to report people on Facebook for fictitious violations of
our Community Standards, including alleged impersonation, intellectual property
infringements, nudity and terrorism. They also hacked people’s accounts and Pages, and
used some of these compromised accounts for their own operational purposes, including to
amplify their content. On at least one occasion, after a Page admin’s account was
compromised, they removed the remaining admins to take over and disable the Page. Our
investigation suggests that these targeted hacking attempts were likely carried out through a
number of off-platform tactics including email and device compromise and abuse of our
account recovery process.
To disrupt this activity, we removed the accounts and Pages behind this operation. We
shared information about this group with our industry partners so they too can detect and
stop this activity. We encourage people to remain vigilant and take steps to protect their
accounts, avoid clicking on suspicious links and downloading software from untrusted
sources that can compromise their devices and information stored on them.
Vietnam
APT32, an advanced persistent threat actor based in Vietnam, targeted Vietnamese human
rights activists locally and abroad, various foreign governments including those in Laos and
Cambodia, non-governmental organizations, news agencies and a number of businesses
across information technology, hospitality, agriculture and commodities, hospitals, retail, the
auto industry, and mobile services with malware. Our investigation linked this activity to
CyberOne Group, an IT company in Vietnam (also known as CyberOne Security, CyberOne
Technologies, Hành Tinh Company Limited, Planet and Diacauso).

As our industry partners have previously reported, APT32 has deployed a wide range of
adversarial tactics across the internet. We have been tracking and taking action against this
group for several years. Our most recent investigation analyzed a number of notable tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) including:
Social engineering: APT32 created fictitious personas across the internet posing as
activists and business entities, or used romantic lures when contacting people they
targeted. These efforts often involved creating backstops for these fake personas and
fake organizations on other internet services so they appear more legitimate and can
withstand scrutiny, including by security researchers. Some of their Pages were
designed to lure particular followers for later phishing and malware targeting.
Malicious Play Store apps: In addition to using Pages, APT32 lured targets to
download Android applications through Google Play Store that had a wide range of
permissions to allow broad surveillance of peoples’ devices.
Malware propagation: APT32 compromised websites and created their own to include
obfuscated malicious javascript as part of their watering hole attack to track targets’
browser information. A watering hole attack is when hackers infect websites frequently
visited by intended targets to compromise their devices. As part of this, the group built
custom malware capable of detecting the type of operating system a target uses
(Windows or Mac) before sending a tailored payload that executes the malicious code.
Consistent with this group’s past activity, APT32 also used links to file-sharing services
where they hosted malicious files for targets to click and download. Most recently, they
used shortened links to deliver malware. Finally, the group relied on Dynamic-Link
Library (DLL) side-loading attacks in Microsoft Windows applications. They developed
malicious files in exe, rar, rtf and iso formats, and delivered benign Word documents
containing malicious links in text.
The latest activity we investigated and disrupted has the hallmarks of a well-resourced and
persistent operation focusing on many targets at once, while obfuscating their origin. We
shared our findings including YARA rules and malware signatures with our industry peers so
they too can detect and stop this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked associated
domains from being posted on our platform, removed the group’s accounts and notified
people who we believe were targeted by APT32.
