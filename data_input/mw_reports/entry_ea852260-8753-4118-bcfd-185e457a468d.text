H1 2020 Report at a glance
Overall downward trend for percentages of attacked computers
globally
Beginning in H2 2019 we have observed a tendency for decreases in the percentages of
attacked computers, both in the ICS and in the corporate and personal environments.
1. In H1 2020 the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked
has decreased by 6.6 percentage points to 32.6%.
2. The number was highest in Algeria (58.1%), and lowest in Switzerland (12.7%).
3. Despite the overall tendency for the percentages of attacked computers to decrease,
we did see the number grow in the Oil & Gas sector by 1.6 p.p. to 37.8% and by 1.9
p.p. to 39.9 % for computers used in building automation systems. These numbers are
higher than the percentages around the world overall.

Variety of malware
Threats are becoming more targeted and more focused, and as a result, more varied and
complex.
4. Kaspersky solutions in ICS environments blocked over 19.7 thousand malware
modifications from 4,119 different families.
5. We are seeing noticeably more families of backdoors, spyware, Win32 exploits and
malware built on the .Net platform.
6. Ransomware was blocked on 0.63% of ICS computers. This is very similar to the total
of 0.61% in H2 2019.

Main threat sources
The internet, removable media and email continue to be the main sources of threats in the ICS
environment. Predictably, the percentages in the rankings for these threats have decreased.
7. Internet threats were blocked on 16.7% of ICS computers (-6.4 p.p.).
8. Threats penetrating when removable media are connected were blocked on 5.8% of
computers (-1.9 p.p.).
9. Malicious email attachments were blocked on 3.4% of ICS computers (-1.1 p.p.).

Regional differences
Asia and Africa were the least secure.
10. Asian regions occupy 4 out of the TOP 5 positions in the regional rankings based on
the percentage of ICS computers which were attacked. Africa comes second.
11. Southeast Asia is the worst hit - it leads in several ratings:




Percentage of ICS computers where malicious activity was blocked – 49.8%.
percentage of ICS computers where internet threats were blocked – 14.9%.
Percentage of ICS computers where malicious email attachments were blocked 5.8%.

12. Africa leads in the ranking of regions by percentage of ICS computers where
malicious activity was blocked when removable media were connected with (14.9%).

14. The lowest percentage of ICS computers on which threats were blocked when
removable media were connected was in Australia – 0.8%. Northern Europe came in
with a close second of 0.9%.
15. In Australia, Europe, USA and Canada the percentages in the rankings by malicious
email attachments were higher than by threats on removable media with Eastern
Europe as the exception – 3.5% and 3.7% respectively.
Southern and Eastern Europe were the least secure regions in Europe.
16. Southern and Eastern Europe were in the TOP 5 of the rankings by percentages of
ICS computers where malicious email attachments were blocked. Southern Europe
came in second with 5.2% and Eastern Europe fifth with 3.5%.
17. Eastern Europe was the only region in the world where we saw an increase of 0.9 p.p.
in the percentage of computers where threats were blocked when removable media
were connected, coming in with 3.7%.

Key events of H1 2020
Attack on steel maker BlueScope
On May 15, steel maker BlueScope reported an attack which caused disruptions to some of
the company’s enterprises.
The cybersecurity incident was detected in one of the company’s US businesses. In addition
to enterprises in the US, the attack had a slight effect on the company’s businesses in Asia
and New Zealand. The greatest impact was on manufacturing and sales operations in
Australia: some processes were paused and others, including steel dispatches, continued
mostly without using automation tools.
No other details of the attack have been disclosed so far.

APT attacks on industrial companies
WildPressure targeted campaign
In March 2020, Kaspersky experts discovered a previously unknown APT campaign
distributing a Trojan that was dubbed Milum. According to research results, the malware had
been used at least since early 2019 exclusively for attacks on targets in the Middle East, which
included industrial organizations. The campaign was named WildPressure.
Milum has the capability to control devices remotely. It can download and execute commands
sent by its operator, collect a variety of information from the target device and send it to its
C&C server. For their campaign infrastructure, the operators used rented OVH and
Netzbetrieb virtual private servers (VPS) and a domain registered with the Domains by Proxy
anonymization service.
A code analysis of the new malware did not show any notable overlaps or similarities with any
previously known APT campaign.

Malicious campaigns against government and industrial organizations of Azerbaijan
In April 2020, a report was published on targeted attacks that involved a previously unknown
remote-access Trojan (RAT), which was dubbed PoetRAT.
According to the researchers, the attacks targeted Azerbaijan’s government sector,
transportation and industrial companies, primarily those in the energy sector. The investigation
established that the attackers were particularly interested in SCADA systems connected with
wind turbines.
Cisco Talos experts have tracked these attacks since February 2020. Kaspersky experts
identified them in December 2019, reporting them in a private report. The attackers used
a malicious document containing an image that looked like the logo of the Defense R&D
Organization of the Indian ministry of defense. Two more attack waves followed in April,
one of which used what looked like the Azerbaijani government’s documents on COVID-19
as decoys. In the other case, the attackers used a file named “C19.docx” with no readable
content, possibly also a reference to COVID-19.

Microsoft Word documents were used as droppers that installed the Trojan without the user’s
knowledge. After a document was opened, a macro (Visual Basic script) or code using DDE
(Dynamic Data Exchange) was run, extracting the malware and executing it.
The first–stage PoetRAT malware is written in Python. Numerous additional tools, most also
written in Python, were found on victims’ computers. Malware written in Python has been used
in attacks on industrial companies before – such as in the case of the Triton attack.
Another finding made in the course of the investigation was a phishing website imitating the
webmail of the Government of Azerbaijan and designed to steal user credentials.

Targeted attacks on Israeli water supply and wastewater treatment facilities
On April 23, the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) issued a security advisory, which
reported attempted attacks on SCADA systems of water treatment plants, water pumping
stations and sewage networks. It was recommended that water and power supply utilities
urgently change passwords for all systems connecting to the internet as an intrusion
prevention measure. The importance of implementing these measures for systems used to
manage the amount of chlorine added to water was particularly emphasized. Other
recommendations included updating the software and equipment firmware used.
Similar warnings were also published by Israel’s Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) and by the Israeli government's Water Authority.
There were no official reports of confirmed intrusion into any Israeli water treatment or water
supply company, but according to mass media, attacks took place on Friday and Saturday
(April 24 and 25) and affected a number of organizations in different parts of the country.

Ransomware attacks on industrial companies
The wave of ransomware attacks that hit the world in 2019 continued through the first six
months of 2020.

Ransomware attack paralyzes production at Picanol plants in Belgium, Romania and China
On January 13, 2020 Picanol Group, a large manufacturer of high-tech weaving machines,
fell victim to a massive ransomware attack. The attack seriously disrupted the operations of
the company’s manufacturing plants in Belgium, Romania and China. No information has been
released on the ransomware used in the attack.
The attack was discovered during the night, when Picanol employees in China were unable to
access the company’s IT systems. Similar issues also arose in Ypres in Belgium. The
company’s operations were nearly completely paralyzed. Picanol’s 2300 employees were out
of work for over a week.

Ryuk attacks on medical organizations
In H1 2020, Ryuk operators perpetrated massive attacks on hospitals, demanding ransom to
decrypt the files. In March alone, 10 hospitals fell victim to Ryuk attacks in the US.
The attacks were based on the already familiar Ryuk infection scheme involving phishing
emails and TrickBot malware, which enables the attackers to connect to an infected computer
and explore the network of the organization under attack. TrickBot operators try to find
vulnerable systems and to steal user credentials.

Ransomware attacks on pumping solution manufacturer DESMI
On the night of April 7-8, DESMI, a Danish manufacturer of pumping solutions for marine and
industrial applications, suffered a ransomware attack. No information is available on the
malware used in the attack.
According to an official statement, the attack affected the company’s communication systems,
including email, which had to be temporarily disconnected. The company was able to recover
these systems by April 14. The ERP and financial systems were not affected, enabling the
company’s manufacturing sites in China, India, America and Denmark to continue working as
normal, with only minor disturbances.

Ragnar Locker attack on energy company EDP
On April 13, Energias de Portugal (EDP), a large Portuguese energy company, suffered
a ransomware attack. As a result of the attack, which involved the Ragnar Locker malware,
the company’s systems were encrypted. Moreover, the cybercriminals claimed to have stolen
10 TB of sensitive company files before encrypting the data. They threatened to make that
information public unless they were paid a ransom of 1580 BTC (about $10.9 million).
To prove that they really held sensitive information belonging to EDP, Ragnar Locker operators
published some of the stolen data, including employee account names and passwords.
According to the ransom note, the attackers had also gained access to confidential information
on the company’s billing, contracts, transactions, clients and partners.
After analyzing different samples of the ransomware, Kaspersky experts concluded that the
entire text of the ransom note is created specifically for each individual victim, which means
that Ragnar Locker attacks are targeted in nature.

Attack on Stadler industrial facilities
On May 7, 2020 Stadler, a Swiss manufacturer of railway rolling stock, reported a cyberattack
on its industrial facilities. According to the company’s statement, some computers on their
corporate network were infected with malware and data was stolen from the compromised
machines. The threat actors behind the attack contacted company personnel, demanded
a ransom and threatened to publish the stolen data if the victim refused to pay up.
Stadler turned to the appropriate government agencies and hired external IT security experts
to assist with incident investigation. Backup copies were used to restore the affected systems
and operational processes were not affected by the attack.
The company did not reveal which malware was used in the attack. However, since a ransom
was demanded and systems needed to be restored from backups, it is highly likely that
Stadler was the victim of a ransomware attack.

Mailto and Nefilim attacks on logistics company Toll Group
In the first half of 2010, Toll Group, an Australian logistics company, was attacked by
ransomware on two occasions.
The first attack took place in late January. A variant of Mailto ransomware was used. To prevent
the malware from spreading, the company disabled some of its information systems, resulting in
delayed shipments to both corporate and individual customers. Australia’s national postal
service, Australia Post, was among the Toll Group customers whose shipments were delayed.

Toll Group experienced the second attack in May, when one of the company’s corporate
systems was infected with Nefilim ransomware. Data stored on the affected system included
information on the company’s employees, as well as some agreements with corporate
customers. Before encrypting files, the attackers stole about 200 gigabytes of data and
demanded a ransom to unblock the IT systems. However, the management of Toll Group
refused to make a deal with them. In response to the incident, all of the company’s IT systems
were shut down.
On May 20, it became known that Nefilim operators had published part of the stolen data.
By May 29, Toll Group had restored all of its information systems and logistics operations.

Attack of Sodinokibi encryption malware on energy companies
On May 14, 2020, Elexon, a major British electric utility company, reported a malware infection
of their IT network. Only systems on the internal IT network suffered as a result of the attack,
including the email system and laptops. Key IT services and electricity supply systems were
not impacted.
In June, it was reported that the company had been attacked with the Sodinokibi encryption
ransomware, also known as REvil.
Later, the Brazilian electric power utility Light S.A. became another victim of Sodinokibi.
According to mass media, the company was attacked by the ransomware in late June. The
operators of the ransomware demanded a ransom in Monero cryptocurrency amounting to
about $7 mln. After June 19, the ransom doubled to about $14 million.
The attack did not have a negative impact on power supply but it disrupted the company’s
billing-related business processes. Although it was officially confirmed that the attack had
taken place, no other details of the incident were disclosed.
Later, researchers found a sample of Sodinokibi malware, which is likely to have been used in
the attack on Light S.A. The malware is distributed using the Ransomware-as-a-Service,
(RaaS) model and is likely to be associated with the Pinchy Spider criminal group, which was
behind the GandCrab ransomware.

Attack on beverage manufacturer Lion
On June 9, Australian beverage manufacturer Lion fell victim to a ransomware attack. The
company had to shut down infected IT systems, resulting in the suspension of some industrial
processes and impacting product shipments to customers. Specifically, the company paused
production at its breweries in Australia and New Zealand. The attack also affected the
operation of Lion Dairy & Drinks production sites responsible for making a variety of dairy
products.
No information has been published on the ransomware used in the attack on Lion.
On June 18, Lion suffered another ransomware attack. According to mass media, Sodinokibi
(REvil) malware was used in the second attack. The attackers demanded a ransom of
12234.28 XMR (about $800,000) and threatened to publish sensitive data stolen from the
company. They also threatened to double their ransom demands if the money was not paid
by June 19.
According to the latest information on the company’s official website, by June 26 all of the
company’s production sites had been restored to normal operation but the work to recover
their IT systems had not been completed.

Targeted attacks on industrial companies involving Snake ransomware
On June 8, 2020 issues were reported which affected the computer networks of Honda,
a Japanese motorcycle and auto manufacturer, in Europe and Japan. Specifically, it was
announced that Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services were experiencing
technical difficulties.
Information security experts believe that, in all likelihood, one of the company’s servers was
infected with Snake (EKANS) ransomware: a sample of the Snake malware was discovered
on VirusTotal, which checks for Honda’s domain name, “mds.honda.com” (which is probably
used on the company’s internal network). If the domain name cannot be resolved (i.e., if the
corresponding IP address cannot be determined), the ransomware terminates without
encrypting any files. According to the researchers, this could indicate that the attackers’
activity is targeted in nature.
Kaspersky ICS CERT experts used their own telemetry data to identify other samples that
were similar to the sample uploaded to VirusTotal.
The results of our research clearly indicate that the attackers carry out multistage hacker
attacks, each attack targeting a specific organization. Encrypting files using Snake is the final
stage of these attacks. The Snake ransomware is written in Golang programming language,
which is not very widely used and is found today primarily in malware samples used by APT
groups.
It is known that, in addition to Honda, victims include power company Enel Group. According
to Kaspersky ICS CERT data, attack targets also include a German company that supplies its
products to auto makers and other industrial manufacturers and a German manufacturer of
medical equipment and supplies. Apparently, other auto makers and manufacturing
companies have also been attacked: similar Snake samples have been detected on
computers in China, Japan and Europe.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic
In the course of our research, we couldn’t ignore the widely discussed issue of the impact that
the COVID-19 pandemic had on the threat landscape for industrial organizations as a whole
and their OT networks in particular.
It was only to be expected that threat actors would use the pandemic and the global changes
caused by it in their own interests. As numerous sources have reported on many occasions,
the subject of the COVID-19 pandemic is exploited in a large number of phishing attacks, both
mass-scale and targeted.
In one of our private reports available by subscription, we described an APT attack that targets
Azerbaijani enterprises and institutions and makes use of COVID-related documents.

However, a quantitative assessment of changes to the ICS threat landscape has yielded
unexpected results. The only noticeable global trend for growth in the percentage of attacked
ICS computers can only be traced when analyzing the statistics of attacks on RDP (Remote
Desktop Protocol) on industrial computers.
In February – May 2020, there was a clear month-to-month growth (with a subsequent
decrease in June) in the percentage of ICS computers on which Kaspersky solutions detected
attempts to crack RDP passwords through brute force attacks.

As we can see in the diagram, the amplitude of the spring growth in the percentage of ICS
computers subjected to brute force attacks does not exceed that of the annual fluctuations,
although, in this case, the growth was more extended in time than all the previous surges.
Apparently, the increases in the percentage of attacked ICS computers based on this
parameter were provoked by RDP being used more often in February – June 2020.

Curiously, the growth in the percentage of ICS computers on which RDP was enabled in the
first quarter of 2020 occurred against the background of a sufficiently long period of attempts
to reduce the use of RATs by industrial enterprises. The diagram below clearly shows the
decrease in the percentage of ICS computers on which remote administration tools were used
throughout the year 2019. It is worth noting that this parameter stabilized in H1 2020 (and
there was even a slight growth in February – April compared to January) – a phenomenon not
observed in winter and spring 2019. This may also be due to the pandemic.

Percentage of ICS
computers on
which RATs were
used, January
2019 – June 2020

We believe that the increase in the percentage of ICS computers on which RDP is used could
be an indication that most new RDP sessions were authorized by IT and information security
services. In fact, all other things being equal, it may be easier to configure and control the
secure operation of RDP services than that of any other RAT applications. It would seem that
allowing new RDP installations was a compromise caused by the objective need to perform
production-related tasks remotely in a pandemic.
The increase in the percentage of attacked ICS computers on which attempts to brute force
the RDP password were detected (and prevented) may seem insignificant, but it should be
remembered that any such attack, if successful, would immediately have provided the
attackers with remote access to engineering computers and ICS systems. The danger posed
by such attacks should not be underestimated.
As mentioned above, we have so far been unable to identify any other abnormal surges in
malicious activity that could be attributed to the pandemic’s consequences. We hope this was
due to an actual absence of negative changes in the ICS threat landscape.

Overall global statistics
In this section, we present the findings of an analysis of statistical data obtained using
the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), a distributed antivirus network. The data was
received from those KSN users who gave their voluntary consent to have data
anonymously transferred from their computers and processed for the purpose described
in the KSN Agreement for the Kaspersky product installed on their computer.
Connecting to the KSN network enables our customers to reduce the time it takes the
security solutions installed on their systems to respond to previously unknown threats and
to improve the overall detection quality provided by the security products through querying
the cloud infrastructure in which malicious object data is stored. That data is technically
impossible to transfer entirely to the client side due to its large size and resource
consumption.
The telemetry data transferred by the user includes only those types and categories of
information which are described in the relevant KSN Agreement. That data is not only
significantly helpful in analyzing the threat landscape, but it is also necessary to identify
new threats, including targeted attacks and APTs1.

Methodology used to prepare statistics
The statistical data presented in the report was received from ICS computers protected by
Kaspersky products that Kaspersky ICS CERT categorizes as part of the industrial
infrastructure at organizations. This group includes Windows computers that perform one or
several of the following functions:


supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers,



data storage servers (Historian),



data gateways (OPC),



stationary workstations of engineers and operators,



mobile workstations of engineers and operators,



Human Machine Interface (HMI),



computers used for industrial network administration,



computers used to develop software for industrial automation systems.

For the purposes of this report, attacked computers are those on which Kaspersky security
solutions blocked one or more threats during the reporting period. When determining
percentages of machines on which malware infections were prevented, we use the ratio of the
number of computers attacked during the reporting period to the total number of computers in
our sample from which we received anonymized information during the reporting period.

1 We recommend that organizations which have any restrictions in place with respect to transferring data

outside the organization’s perimeter should consider using the Kaspersky Private Security Network
service.

The reasons for this decrease are many including the following:


A decrease in mass attacks focusing on infecting computers with spyware, botnet
agents, cryptominers and adware;



A shift from mass-scale attacks to more localized ones, specifically:



o

A transition from massive phishing campaigns to smaller localized attacks;

o

A decrease in malicious and infected web resources utilized for large-scale
malware spreading;

A decrease in machines infected with old self-propagating malware – worms and
viruses.

At the same time, threats are becoming more local, targeted and, as a result, more complex
and less noticeable.

Percentage of computers on which malicious objects were blocked
In H1 2020, malicious objects were blocked on 32.6% of ICS computers – this is lower than
H2 2019 by 6.6 percentage points.

Despite the overall tendency for decreasing percentages of attacked computers in H1 2020,
the numbers have risen slightly in the Oil & Gas sector, as well as in building automation
systems.
Computers in building automation systems are often connected to corporate networks and
have access to various services, including the internet, corporate email, domain controllers
and so forth. In other words, these machines have the same attack surfaces as computers
in the regular corporate network, and certainly larger when compared to ICS computers.
For instance, a recent investigation of an attack involving the Snake ransomware showed that
Kaspersky solutions had blocked malware not only in the corporate network of an industrial
facility, but also on the video surveillance servers, which were connected to the corporate
domain controller.
THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION
SYSTEMS. H1 2020

15
© KASPERSKY, 1997 – 2020

Building automation systems often belong to contractor organizations and even when these
systems have access to the client’s corporate network, they are not always controlled by the
corporate information security team. Given that the decrease in mass attacks is offset by an
increase in the number and complexity of targeted attacks where we see active utilization of
various lateral movement tools, building automation systems might turn out to be even less
secure than corporate systems within the same network.
In H1 2020 Kaspersky solutions blocked numerous new variants of worms written in script
languages, specifically Python and PowerShell, on computers used for design, maintain and
automate industrial systems in the Oil & Gas sector. The surge in these detections occurred
from the end of March to mid-June 2020, mainly in China and the Middle East.
All of the detected worm samples, both in Python and in PowerShell, are capable of collecting
authentication credentials from the memory of system processes on the attacked machines in
order to spread within the network. In most cases, the malware uses different versions of
Mimikatz to steal authentication credentials from memory. However, there were some
PowerShell samples which used the comsvsc.dll system library (MS Windows) to save
a memory dump of the system process in which the malware then searched for authentication
credentials.

The variety of malware detected
In H1 2020, Kaspersky security solutions blocked over 19.7 thousand malware modifications
from 4,119 different families on industrial automation systems. We have tracked noticeably
larger numbers of families in the following categories: backdoor, spyware, Win32 exploits and
.NET malware.

Malicious object categories
The malicious objects blocked by Kaspersky solutions fall into many different categories.
To give a better idea of the types of threats blocked by Kaspersky products, we conducted
a detailed classification. Note that the resulting percentages should not be summed up
because in many cases threats of two or more types may have been blocked on a single
computer during the given reporting period.
The results of our detailed analysis revealed the following estimated percentages of ICS
computers on which the activity of malicious objects from different categories had been
prevented:

Web-antivirus protects a computer when programs installed on it (browsers, email
clients, automatic application update modules and others) attempt to connect to
blacklisted IP addresses and URLs. Such web resources are associated in some
way with distributing or controlling malware.
Specifically, blacklisted resources include, among others, those used to distribute
such malware as Trojan-Spy or ransomware disguised as utilities for cracking or
resetting passwords on controllers of various manufacturers, or as cracks/patches
for industrial and engineering software used in industrial networks.

6.5% – malicious scripts and redirects on web resources (JS and HTML) executed
in the context of the browser, as well as browser exploits – 0.2%.



5.6% – Spy Trojans, backdoors and keyloggers, which appear in numerous
phishing emails sent to industrial enterprises. As a rule, the ultimate goal of such
attacks is to steal money.



5.1% – worms (Worm), which usually spread via removable media and network
shares, as well as worms distributed via email (Email-Worm), network
vulnerabilities (Net-Worm) and instant messengers (IM-Worm).
Most worms are obsolete from the network infrastructure viewpoint. However, there
are also worms like Zombaque (0.02%) which implement a P2P network
architecture allowing threat actors to activate them at any point.



3.2% – Virus class malware.
These programs include such families as Sality (0.9%), Nimnul (0.6%), and Virut
(0.4%), which have been detected for many years. Although these malicious
families are considered obsolete because their command-and-control servers have
long been inactive, they usually make a significant contribution to the statistics due
to their self-propagation and insufficient measures taken to completely neutralize
them.



3.1% – malicious LNK files.
These files are mainly blocked on removable media. They are part of the
distribution mechanism for older families such as Andromeda/Gamarue, Dorkbot,
Jenxcus/Dinihou and others.
This category also includes a wide variety of LNK files with the CVE-2010-2568
vulnerability (0.4%), which was first exploited to distribute the Stuxnet worm and
has later been exploited to spread many other families, such as Sality,
Nimnul/Ramnit, ZeuS, Vobfus, etc.
Today, LNK files disguised as legitimate documents can be used as part of a
multistage attack. They run a PowerShell script that downloads a malicious file.
In rare cases, the malicious PowerShell script downloads binary code – a specially
crafted modification of a passive TCP backdoor from the Metasploit kit – and
injects the code into memory.



2.2% – malicious documents (MSOffice + PDF) containing exploits, malicious
macros or malicious links.



1.5% – malicious files (executables, scripts, autorun.inf, .LNK and others) that run
automatically at system startup or when removable media are connected.



These files come from a variety of families that have one thing in common – autorun.
The least harmful functionality of such files is automatically launching the browser
with a predefined home page. In most cases, malicious programs that use
autorun.inf are modifications of malware from old families (Palevo, Sality, Kido, etc.).
1.3% – banking Trojans.



1.2% – web miners running in browsers. 0.9% – miners in the form of executable
files for Windows.



0.9% – malware for AutoCad.
It is worth noting that malware for AutoCad, specifically viruses, is mainly detected
on computers that are part of industrial networks, including network shares and
engineering workstations, in East Asia.



0.6% – ransomware.



0.5% – malicious files for mobile devices that are blocked when such devices are
connected to computers.

Ransomware
In H1 2020 ransomware was blocked on 0.63% of ICS computers, which does not differ
significantly from the previous six months (0.61%).
Throughout H1 2020 this number fluctuated between a low of 0.18% in March and a high of
0.22% in February.

The H1 2020 results see China return to one of the top five positions in the ranking for the first
time since 2017.
The most significant increase in the percentage of ICS computers where malicious activity was
prevented occurred in Greece (by 7.8 p.p.), Thailand (by 6.2 p.p.) and Portugal (by 4.3 p.p.).
The numbers decreased in the vast majority of countries, most noticeably in South Africa
(by 19.1 p.p.), Israel (by 12.8 p.p.), Russia (by 13.9 p.p.) and Kuwait (by 10 p.p.). As a result
Kuwait has now even appeared in the list of the 10 most secure countries. It is worth noting
that two Eastern European countries are also on this list once again: Czech Republic and
Slovakia.

We need to emphasize that in those regions where the smallest percentages of internet
threats were blocked on ICS computers, aka Europe, USA and Canada, and Australia, the
percentages of threats arriving via email attachments are greater than the percentages of
threats borne by removable media. Eastern Europe is the exception where these numbers are
similar.
In the remaining regions the percentage of ICS computers where threats penetrating when
removable media were connected is significantly larger than the percentage of ICS computers
where malicious email attachments were blocked.

Internet
The internet is the main source of threats worldwide. The percentage of ICS computers on
which internet threats were blocked in Northern and Western Europe, Australia and in North
America is less than 10%. At the same time, this percentage is over 20% in Africa, Southeast
and Central Asia.
