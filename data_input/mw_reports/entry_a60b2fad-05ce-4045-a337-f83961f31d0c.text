Taking off the Blackshades

About two years ago, I wrote a series of blog posts that covered a particular Remote Access
Trojan (RAT) known as Blackshades. The posts covered how Blackshades was used against
Syrian rebels, how the co-creator was arrested and a detailed analysis of the RAT
functionality.
Well if you haven’t heard, they are back in the news again, this time because of a massive
global effort by law enforcement to take down the RAT once and for all.

Last Monday, a mass arrest took place against not only the creators and distributors of
Blackshades but also the customers. More than 90 people were arrested globally for being
somehow involved with Blackshades in the largest offensive move against RATs ever done
by global law enforcement.

Can you ever get rid of RATs?
So what does this mean for the current and potential victims of Blackshades and RAT
technology?
Fortunately, the interest in Blackshades has decreased due to an array of different issues
with the product. Customers are no longer trusting of the tool, not only because of the arrests
but also because of bugged versions discovered that opened a backdoor onto the attackers
system, essentially turning a bad guy into just another victim.

“For Newcomers I can tell, don’t touch RAT’s like Blackshades, because they are backdoored and
outdated…”

Unfortunately, when one tool or bad guy gets busted in the cyber-crime community, it doesn’t
stop the crime but merely modifies its execution.
Already, criminals who were considering using Blackshades have sought out different tools
that are a bit less popular in the hopes that they can still achieve their malicious goal without
the greater risk of being busted by the FBI.
The appeal of Blackshades was that it was often updated and had been used so greatly that
its popularity brought droves of potential customers to its door.

The Freemium Model
Blackshades was usually sold for $40 a pop, for the most updated version. This amount also
came with customer support and access to new updates for the software.
However, paying wasn’t the only option. In my previous blog posts about Blackshades,
namely ‘You Dirty Rat Part 2″ I obtained a free (cracked) version of Blackshades for testing
purposes.

Blackshades Server Binary Builder

The software was an older version that was currently available so it meant that some of the
more advanced features were not available.
In addition, while many ‘free’ versions of Blackshades usually come bundled with a backdoor
or additional malware to infect the criminals, this one was completely clean.

Just a sample of the kind of junk I got infected with looking for a legitimate version of Blackshades

I didn’t get my hands on a free version by simply asking around my cyber criminal buddies,
or being part of some underground forum, all I had to do was search around online a little bit
until I found one. Something that even a kid could do.

The Real Danger
So if you are wondering if an outdated version of Blackshades is even a threat, the answer is
absolutely. Though its necessary to talk about the real threat associated with any malware,
that is the delivery method and crypters.
So, delivery method refers to how the malware actually gets on the system. The easy
methods are things like a mass phishing email that makes you download and execute some
program, not many people fall for that.
Then of course there is the act of social engineering via bot or manually using things like
Skype or Facebook to trick someone into trusting the criminal and then getting them to install
the malware.

The third threat is drive-by exploits.
We have seen many types of malware distributed by drive-by exploits, all this attack requires
is that a victim visit a certain website that exploits an application through the browser,
something like Java or Flash. Usually this is a huge concern if the victim has failed to update
those applications with security patches.
Next up are crypters, which are basically just applications that apply a custom algorithm to
the malware binary, mixing up the code and making it difficult to detect using traditional
passive scan methods.
This means that if an old version of Blackshades was encrypted with a modern crypter tool, it
could potentially bypass an antivirus scan and even email filters that check for malware
(Thanks Gmail!)
Crypters are the real underground market commodity and since they are usually created by
individuals and maybe even small teams then sold to bot herders.
It is unlikely that we will see a mass arrest toward the entire crypter industry. They are also
usually sold for far more than the malware itself, in fact Blackshades had a built-in crypter
marketplace that it included in it’s control panel, to make it easy for the bad guys to find a
crypter and apply it to their malware.

Lucky for us, most antivirus and anti-malware software includes active protection will detect
the operations of the malware after it has “decrypted” itself, which all malware must do
before it can actually run on the system.
In addition, a scan with a security product AFTER the malware has been installed will most
likely remove it from your system, no problem.

Proactive Protection
So what can you do to protect yourself from RATs? Well common security practices are
always recommended, but specifically with this type of threat:
Install security software, be it a free or paid version of something like Malwarebytes
Anti-Malware, Kaspersky AV or whatever you want, as long as it stays updated and can
detect the most common RATs.
Put a piece of opaque tape over your webcam OR unplug your webcam (if possible)
Keep your microphone muted when not using it. You can do this through the operating
system in many cases.
A common trick used by bad guys controlling a RAT is to paste the contents of
whatever is currently loaded in the systems copy cache. It’s important that whenever
you copy something sensitive, like a password, you copy something less important
when you are done.
Log off of social media when you are done using it, a RAT can take control of your
browser that includes a valid and open instance of a social media site, allowing them to
post on your behalf.
Be suspicious of everything, if your mouse moves on it’s own or if your cursor suddenly
types something that you don’t remember typing or if a window closes or opens on it’s
own, maybe it’s a good time to run a deep scan.

Is It Over?
Like I mentioned before, the threats that RATs pose will never be over, at least not for a
while. We will see an evolution of their ability based on the market needs and the
capabilities of hardware and software, you can expect that much of a change.
As far as Blackshades being done with, it’s possible that a lack of interest due to the high
profile of this malware might drive away a large portion of the market, in which case
Blackshades won’t be updated and it’s functionality will become obsolete.
It will only be a matter of time though until we see the next big RAT malware making its way
from underground forums to user systems, we certainly know there are plenty of them that
can take the throne.

The Bright Side
While RATs are incredibly dangerous, the bright side is that they are very inefficient.
The largest customer group for Remote Access Trojans are individuals or small groups who
just want to use it to mess with people or steal valuable and sensitive information (images
included). Even still, the time and effort it takes to launch an attack using a RAT and

9/10

obtaining anything juicy against a stranger is usually greater than most cyber criminals have
the patience for.
The bottom line is that while RATs are a danger and you should keep an eye out for the
possibility of one running on your system, we can all be even more afraid of things like
Ransomware and Banker Trojans that have been skillfully created for the purpose of efficient
user destruction.
