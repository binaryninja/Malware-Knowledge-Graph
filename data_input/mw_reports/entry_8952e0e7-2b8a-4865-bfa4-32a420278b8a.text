Summary:
Been an interesting few weeks and I haven’t been able to update but the other researchers
appear to have found a few interesting things. I thought I would blog if anyone wanted a pcap
to look at.
I actually found this through my normal malvertising route. After pondering and assistance
the payload was determined to be Smoke Loader leading to a Miner and AZORult stealer. It’s
an interesting sample! Thanks to @James_inthe_box for looking into it deeper.

Full Details:
This campaign was spotted a few days back (clicky) by @BroadAnalysis. I however found
this through my usual malvertising campaign. It was only after that I realised that the IP of
the domain is the same as the previous post that was reported. The payload however is
different and much like the Rulan campaign it is likely the payloads will change often so it’s
worth keeping an eye on this.
The chain involves a series of 302 redirects:

The final redirect takes the client to Rig EK:

The payload was actually very interesting. I noticed a process injection which is Smoke
Loader. I then saw the two binaries one of which was a miner and the other is AZORult
stealer. I did upload the sample to Hybrid Analysis here are the results:

Now on my lab I did not see the mining C2 which connected to 213.32.29.150:14444.
However it did change the same registry key from the sandbox analysis. Below are two
examples of POST requests from the first binary believed to be Smoke Loader:

The second binary is “Asus Gaming” that produced the zbot like POST requests to C2. This
is actually AZORult:
