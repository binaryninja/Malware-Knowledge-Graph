Threats to the 2020 Tokyo
Olympic Games

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Key Judgments
• State-sponsored threat actors likely pose the most
significant threat to the Olympic Games and Olympicsaffiliated entities based on their sophisticated
capabilities as well as ongoing disputes between various
states and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or
associated bodies.
• Given coordinated cyber campaigns targeting previous
Olympic Games and affiliated organizations linked to
Russian threat activity groups, as well as the current
dispute between the IOC and Russia over the country’s
eligibility to participate in international sporting events,
Russian APT groups are likely the most motivated to
target and disrupt the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. APT
groups linked to other nation-states, such as China,
North Korea, or Iran, either lack historical precedence
for targeting such events or are assessed to lack the
requisite motivation to do so in the case of the Tokyo
Olympic Games.

This report synthesizes findings from the Recorded Future® Platform,
dark web communities, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources to
analyze the threat landscape ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, set to
begin on July 23, 2021, after COVID-19 pandemic-related postponements.
This report will be of most interest to organizations affiliated with the
Olympics organization, Olympic sponsors, or individuals intending to
participate or attend the upcoming Olympic Games.

Executive Summary
The Olympic Games are a target-rich environment,
drawing athletes from more than 200 nations, worldwide
media coverage, and thousands of spectators. The high
profile and international nature of the event make the
Olympics a target for those seeking to cause politically
motivated harm, enrich themselves through criminality,
or embarrass the host nation on the international stage.
Past Olympics have seen the targeting of the Olympics
organization and its partners, such as the World AntiDoping Agency, from a variety of threat actors.
The upcoming Olympics Games are likely to attract
state-sponsored threat activity groups, cybercriminals,
and groups motivated by political grievances and
regional tensions. Nevertheless, at the time of writing,
Recorded Future has not identified any direct threats,
planned attacks, or cyber operations against the Tokyo
Olympic Games.

• Ransomware likely poses the greatest threat to
Olympics-nexus organizations from the cybercriminal
perspective. On June 25, 2021, various newspapers in
Japan reported that the Japanese Olympic Committee
(JOC) was affected by ransomware in April 2020.
Ransomware operators are likely to view the Olympics
and associated entities as attractive targets, as
downtime of core infrastructure and services are unlikely
to be acceptable during the Games; as a result, victim
organizations may be heavily incentivized to quickly pay
ransoms to restore normal operations.
• State-sponsored propaganda and disinformation outlets
are engaging in initial influence activities against the
Tokyo games to generate controversy and undermine the
event as unpopular, unsafe, or unfair. These narratives
are likely to continue throughout the event.
• Recorded Future has not observed any direct physical
threats aimed toward the Tokyo Olympics or the athletes
themselves. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
associated restrictions on international guests in Japan
likely reduces the opportunity for such attacks to take
place. The Olympics are a common venue for political
protest, and widespread opposition to the games in
Japan due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the
country is likely to inspire domestic protests. None of the
protests thus far observed, however, have been violent.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS
In November 2020, Cybereason published details regarding
the similarities in URL patterns and infrastructure used by Gold
Dragon and several other malware linked to Kimsuky, another
North Korean state-sponsored threat group. Kimsuky has
historically targeted individuals and experts in various fields,
think tanks, and government entities in South Korea, Japan,
and the United States, as well as universities with biomedical
engineering expertise.

China
APT Threat Groups and Activity
There is no historical precedent for Chinese threat activity
groups targeting major international sporting events or sporting
bodies. China has also shown significantly more restraint
compared to other nations in conducting wide-reaching
destructive or disruptive attacks. Therefore, while Chinese
groups have regularly targeted specific organizations and
governments ahead of key talks, and Beijing’s cyber-enabled
monitoring of ethnic and religious minorities domestically and
internationally is well documented, it is unlikely that China poses
a disruptive threat to the Olympic Games at this time.
However, Japan remains a major focus of Chinese cyber
espionage efforts both through threat activity groups affiliated
with China’s principal civilian foreign intelligence service, the
Ministry of State Security (MSS), and its military intelligence
apparatus, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support
Force (SSF), due to the regional proximity between the two
countries.

• Tick, also known as Bronze Butler, has historically
used custom malware variants to target defense,
aerospace, chemical, and satellite industries, primarily
focused on organizations with head offices in Japan
and subsidiaries in China. In April 2021, Japanese news
sources reported that the group is linked to PLA-SSF
Unit 61419 located in Qingdao. Tick is suspected of
having close links to Tonto Team, another Chinese group
which both targets Japan and has been linked to the
PLA, specifically the Shenyang Military Region Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau. While the groups have distinct
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and targeting
profiles, they have been identified sharing capabilities. In
early 2020, Tick Group was linked to a historical intrusion
disclosed by the Japanese multinational Mitsubishi
Electric.
• A 2020 JPCERT report observed the use of WINNTI
malware in targeted attacks reported around August
2020. In previous years, various Japanese security
researchers (1, 2) also observed the use of the WINNTI
malware variants all the way from 2013 to 2020. WINNTI
(aka HIGHNOON) is a longstanding backdoor and rootkit
that has been historically used by multiple APT groups,
including APT17 and APT41.
• Numerous reports from Japan’s Computer Emergency
Response Team (JPCERT) indicate that Blacktech, also
known as Palmerworm and Temp.Overboard, was highly
active in 2017 and 2018 targeting Japanese corporations,
with recent reporting indicating the group’s continued
activity. BlackTech was also named in a 2019 breach
against the major Japanese multinational Mitsubishi
Electric, the same organization subsequently targeted by
Tick. The same Japanese sources also link BlackTech to a
military unit based in Wuhan; however, the group has not
currently been attributed to a specific PLA unit.

Recorded Future tracks several Chinese groups (detailed
below) with a strong Japan focus that could lead them to conduct
intelligence-gathering operations targeting Olympic officials and
sponsors. Furthermore, athletes or individuals who may seek
to use publicity associated with the Olympics to shed light on
purported human rights abuses within China, such as that of
Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, are more likely to be individually Iran
targeted for monitoring and surveillance purposes. The main
APT Threat Groups and Activity
Chinese APT groups with a Japan focus are the following:
• APT10, also known as Stone Panda, CVNX, MenuPass,
POTASSIUM, and Red Apollo, is a Chinese statesponsored threat group that has been active since
approximately 2009. The group, composed of private
contractors who operate through a series of front
companies, operates on behalf of Tianjin State Security
Bureau, a provincial bureau of China’s MSS. While APT10
has always had a focus on Japan, the group has also
targeted organizations globally. However, post-US
government indictment, the group has become even
more regionally focused, with all recently published
activity specifically targeting Japan-linked private sector
organizations.

Iranian APTs have not been previously identified launching
destructive cyberattacks or cyber espionage intrusions
against the Olympics or organizations associated with sporting
federations. This does not, however, preclude Iranian APTs from
leading espionage intrusion attempts against organizations
supporting the Olympics or people attending them. Of the
major Iranian threat activity groups, APT39 would most likely
be responsible for penetrating anti-government networks that
may attempt to use the Olympics in Japan as an opportunity
to engage with Iranian athletes, their teams, and government
representatives. As such, facilities hosting Iranian athletes are
at increased risk of targeting.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

This is due to the fact that the sets of credentials typically have
extensive information about the source of the credentials and
cookies scraped from the victim.

Ransomware Threats
Ransomware likely poses the greatest cybercriminal threat
to Olympics-nexus organizations. On June 25, 2021, various
newspapers in Japan reported that the Japanese Olympic
Committee (JOC) was affected by ransomware in April 2020.
Recorded Future has not observed chatter or indicators
suggesting that ransomware operators are specifically targeting
Olympics-related organizations at this time. However, as
ransomware operations are generally opportunistic in nature,
and due to the high-profile, international nature of the games,
such organizations are likely to be attractive targets for
ransomware operations. The downtime of core infrastructure
and services is unlikely to be acceptable during the games; as
a result, the victims are likely to be induced to pay ransoms and
restore normal operations quickly.
Recorded Future examined ransomware extortion websites
since January 2020 and identified 35 references to 2020 Olympic
Games-related entities posted on Corporate Leaks, an extortion
website managed by Nefilim ransomware operators. The website
is used to post the name or domain of victims infected with
Nefilim ransomware, along with a sample set of data stolen from
the victim network. Analysis of the content posted on Corporate
Leaks indicated that the Olympic Games-related documents
were likely a part of an attack against Luxottica Group, an Italian
eyewear conglomerate and the world’s largest eyewear company,
which was hit by a ransomware attack in September 2020.
We identified the following Tokyo Olympic-related documents
published by the Nefilim ransomware operators:

Threats to Olympic Infrastructure
The 2020 Olympic infrastructure faces threats from several
sources, including both cyberattacks and physical threats. We
believe that as the opening date for the Olympics approaches,
there will likely be an increase in phishing attempts made
against Olympics employees, partners, vendors, and customers.

5

Additionally, Olympic planners and policymakers should be
alert to commonly used techniques involving distributed denial
of service (DDoS) attacks, website defacements, domain
typosquatting, and spearphishing attacks.

Phishing Attacks
Particular vigilance against phishing attacks is warranted,
as this has been a common vector for APT and other threat
groups to target Olympic infrastructure during past games.
These phishing attacks can lead to malware infections, causing
loss of data as well as physical damage to Olympic properties.
We identified approximately 721 references to Olympicsrelated phishing events in the last 3 months. While threat
actor attribution for phishing events is difficult, we observed
common themes in the structure of the phishing messages, such
as the use of urgent language in emails, the impersonation of
executives or vendors, and the use of malicious websites posing
as vendors or ticketing systems. It is likely that the overall goals
of these phishing emails were to install malware on targeted
networks and to gather user credentials that could be used for
more targeted attacks.
The 2020 Tokyo Olympics was affected by a May 2021
compromise of the ProjectWEB platform. ProjectWEB is a
Japanese cloud-based enterprise collaboration and file-sharing
platform launched in the mid-2000s and is broadly used today
by Japanese government agencies. In the intrusion, an unknown
threat actor was able to access ProjectWEB and obtain at least
76,000 email addresses, proprietary information, and email
system settings. The attackers then gained access to Japan’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Tokyo’s Narita International
Airport through ProjectWEB and stole air traffic control data,
flight schedules, and information on business operations.
On June 2, 2021, the Japanese government’s National Center
of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC)
confirmed in a statement that the compromise had exposed
data of some 170 people who participated in a cybersecurity
drill ahead of the Olympic Games. The leaked data included the
names and affiliations of people from 90 organizations involved
in hosting the Olympics, according to a Japan Times article.
However, the ProjectWEB intrusion was likely a supply chain
attack to steal information from various Japanese organizations
as opposed to a targeted attempt to compromise the Olympics,
with the main users of the ProjectWEB platform being Japanese
government agencies.

identified organized hacktivist groups announcing their intent
to target 2020 Olympics infrastructure at this time.
Past campaigns include the 2016 Anonymous campaign
#OpOlympicHacking ,which has been the most widely noted in
regards to targeting the Olympic Games .The aforementioned
campaign saw hacktivists using social media channels to
organize coordinated DDoS attacks ,discuss vulnerabilities within
targeted networks ,and announce the results of campaigns.
These attacks were not limited to Olympic-related websites,
but also affected companies related to the Olympics such as
sponsors ,hosting cities ,and governmental websites.
However ,our data and analysis indicate that ,similar to
research conducted by others over the past year ,chatter
surrounding hacktivist attacks has been in steep decline since
a peak between 2015 and .2016 The number of large enterprises
susceptible to SQL injection attacks or DDoS floods has
decreased ,likely due to more mature website structures and
the use of DDoS protection services like Akamai and Cloudflare.
Although some hacktivist actors are highly skilled ,more often
than not many members of a hacktivist organization are novices
and rely upon simple and outdated tools and techniques that are
easily defeated by competent network defenders.

Figure 1: Media mentions of hacktivism-related cyberattacks, 2010–2019 (Source: Recorded Future)

Hacktivist groups rely on media attention to spread their
message, and disruptive cyber activities during the event will
receive immediate press attention, as observed during the 2018
PyeongChang Olympics. For example, various Iranian hacktivist
groups have historically launched targeted website defacement
attacks against international football teams, either in support
of a local Iranian team competing in international competitions
or in support of Iran’s national football team. Such attacks have
been committed by members responsible for the ALFA TEaM’s
AlfaShell and have targeted a host of international and regional
football sporting organizations.

In large part, attacks such as those committed against
the Syrian Football Federation after a 2018 FIFA World Cup
qualifying game, or against Bahrain’s Football Association (BFA)
after a 2022 World Cup qualifier, materialized as hacktivists
perceiving a sense of injustice or in response to insults against
the Iranian football team or nation. Given the current tensions
between Japan and South Korea as well as the political disputes
related to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands with China, a nationalistic
hacktivist campaign out of China in particular targeting Japanese
infrastructure is plausible but deemed unlikely given the recent
decline in patriotic hacktivism in recent years.

• The 2020 Tokyo Games are unsafe: Russian state media
outlets have portrayed the Olympic organizing committee

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Currently, all foreign nationals aside from those with
residency status are barred from entering Japan. On June 20,
2021, Tokyo and 6 other prefectures entered into a quasi-state
of emergency, which will last until July 11. Officials have since
hinted that the imposition of more stringent state of emergency
measures remains an option in the lead-up to the Games. The
government also announced that it is aiming to allow domestic
spectators to attend the Olympic games, although this figure
at the time of writing was set to 10,000 people, not including
delegates or sponsors.
On May 14, 2021, the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games announced that they would be
reducing the number of visiting officials to 90,000 and that “only
people who have a role to play, the operational role to play will be
in Tokyo”. This reduction was aimed toward visitors from the IOC
and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Additionally,
this reduction would also likely affect those associated with
international sports federations, media outlets, sponsors, and
their guests.

Physical Threats
At the time of writing, Recorded Future has not observed
any direct physical threats aimed toward the Tokyo Olympics
or the athletes themselves. While physical attacks are unusual
at Olympic events, they are not unheard of. The opportunities
for threat actors to carry out physical attacks on spectators or
athletes are likely reduced due to residual COVID-19 restrictions
in Japan. Moreover, because of reduced crowd sizes, the
potential effect of such attacks is reduced significantly.

Outlook
Major international events such as the Olympics are prime
opportunities for threat actors globally to spy on individuals
and organizations of interest, embarrass the host country by
disrupting the event, express political stances, or turn a profit
through criminal activities. The upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympic
Games are no exception, although the threat landscape for this
iteration of the Olympics looks considerably different from those
of previous years due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While COVID restrictions reduce the likelihood of physical
threats and widespread disruptive protests, nation-states,
criminals, and hacktivists alike are likely to remain motivated to
conduct operations to achieve their various ends. For Russian
APT groups, for example, which we believe the most likely statebacked actor set to target the Tokyo Games, disrupting the games
is likely to be viewed as just retribution for the country’s being
banned from participating. For their part, ransomware gangs
are likely to view the games as a lucrative target for extortion
attacks, as extended downtime of key infrastructure is likely to
have highly disruptive effects on the event. Finally, hacktivists,
be they patriotic or motivated by particular moral grievances,
likely view the Olympics as high-visibility opportunities to
express their particular messages, but such activity has been in
general decline for several years.
While state-sponsored and even ransomware gang activity
is difficult to predict, as the games draw nearer, we expect
threat actor chatter around the event to increase, additional
typosquat or Olympics-themed domains to be registered and
become active in credential-harvesting and malware campaigns,
and discussions of planned protests to increase.
