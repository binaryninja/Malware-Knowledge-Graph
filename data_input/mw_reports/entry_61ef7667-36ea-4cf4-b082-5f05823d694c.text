April 10, 2017

The Justice Department today announced an extensive effort to disrupt and dismantle the
Kelihos botnet – a global network of tens of thousands of infected computers under the
control of a cybercriminal that was used to facilitate malicious activities including harvesting
login credentials, distributing hundreds of millions of spam e-mails, and installing
ransomware and other malicious software.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal
Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder for the District of Alaska, Assistant Director
Scott Smith for the FBI’s Cyber Division and FBI Special Agent in Charge Marlin Ritzman of
the AnchorageDivision made the announcement.
“The operation announced today targeted an ongoing international scheme that was
distributing hundreds of millions of fraudulent e-mails per year, intercepting the credentials to
online and financial accounts belonging to thousands of Americans, and spreading
ransomware throughout our networks. The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized
quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans,
driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday
lives,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco. “Our success in disrupting the Kelihos
botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law
enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics. The Department of
Justice is committed to combatting cybercrime, no matter the size or sophistication of the
scheme, and to punish those who are engaged in such crimes.”
“Cybercrime is a worldwide problem, but one that infects its victims directly through the
computers and personal electronic devices that we use every day,” said Acting U.S. Attorney
Bryan Schroder for the District of Alaska. “Protecting the American people from such a

1/3

worldwide threat requires a broad-reaching response, and the dismantling of the Kelihos
botnet was such an operation. We are lucky that we have talented FBI agents and federal
prosecutors with the skillsets to help protect Americans from this pervasive cybercrime.”
“On April 8, 2017, we started the extraordinary task of blocking malicious domains
associated with the Khelios botnet to prohibit further infections,” said FBI Special Agent in
Charge Ritzman. “This case demonstrates the FBI’s commitment to finding and eradicating
cyber threats no matter where they are in the world.”
Kelihos malware targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating
system. Infected computers became part of a network of compromised computers known as
a botnet and were controlled remotely through a decentralized command and control
system. According to the civil complaint, Peter Yuryevich Levashov allegedly operated the
Kelihos botnet since approximately 2010. The Kelihos malware harvested user credentials
by searching infected computers for usernames and passwords and by intercepting network
traffic. Levashov allegedly used the information gained from this credential harvesting
operation to further his illegal spamming operation which he advertised on various online
criminal forums. The Kelihos botnet generated and distributed enormous volumes of
unsolicited spam e-mails advertising counterfeit drugs, deceptively promoting stocks in order
to fraudulently increase their price (so-called “pump-and-dump” stock fraud schemes), workat-home scams, and other frauds. Kelihos was also responsible for directly installing
additional malware onto victims’ computers, including ransomware and malware that
intercepts users’ bank account passwords.
As with other botnets, Kelihos is designed to operate automatically and undetected
on victims’ computers, with the malicious code secretly sending requests for instructions to
the botnet operator. In order to liberate the victim computers from the botnet, the United
States obtained civil and criminal court orders in the District of Alaska. These orders
authorized measures to neutralize the Kelihos botnet by (1) establishing substitute servers
that receive the automated requests for instructions so that infected computers no longer
communicate with the criminal operator and (2) blocking any commands sent from the
criminal operator attempting to regain control of the infected computers.
In seeking authorization to disrupt and dismantle the Kelihos botnet, law enforcement
obtained a warrant pursuant to recent amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure. A copy of this warrant along with the other court orders are produced
below. The warrant obtained by the government authorizes law enforcement to redirect
Kelihos-infected computers to a substitute server and to record the Internet Protocol
addresses of those computers as they connect to the server. This will enable the
government to provide the IP addresses of Kelihos victims to those who can assist with
removing the Kelihos malware including internet service providers.
The efforts to disrupt and dismantle the Kelihos botnet were led by the FBI’s Anchorage
Office and New Haven Office; Senior Counsel Ethan Arenson and Harold Chun, and Trial
Attorney Frank Lin of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Assistant
2/3

U.S. Attorneys Yvonne Lamoureux and Adam Alexander of the District of Alaska. Critical
assistance was also provided by foreign partners, and invaluable technical assistance was
provided by Crowd Strike and The Shadow server Foundation in executing this operation.
The details contained in the civil complaint and related pleadings are merely accusations,
and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The Government has and will continue to share samples of the Kelihos malware with the
internet security community so that antivirus vendors can update their programs to detect
and remove Kelihos. A number of free and paid antivirus programs are already capable of
detecting and removing Kelihos, including the Microsoft Safety Scanner, a free product.
