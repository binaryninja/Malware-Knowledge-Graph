Hildegard: New TeamTNT Malware Targeting Kubernetes

Execu ve Summary
In January 2021, Unit 42 researchers detected a new malware campaign targe ng Kubernetes clusters.
The a ackers gained ini al access via a misconﬁgured kubelet that allowed anonymous access. Once
ge ng a foothold into a Kubernetes cluster, the malware a empted to spread over as many containers
as possible and eventually launched cryptojacking opera ons. Based on the tac cs, techniques and
procedures (TTP) that the a ackers used, we believe this is a new campaign from TeamTNT. We refer to
this new malware as Hildegard, the username of the tmate account that the malware used.
TeamTNT is known for exploi ng unsecured Docker daemons and deploying malicious container
images, as documented in previous research (Cetus, Black-T and TeamTNT DDoS). However, this is the
ﬁrst me we found TeamTNT targe ng Kubernetes environments. In addi on to the same tools and
domains iden ﬁed in TeamTNT’s previous campaigns, this new malware carries mul ple new
capabili es that make it more stealthy and persistent. In par cular, we found that TeamTNT’s Hildegard
malware:
Uses two ways to establish command and control (C2) connec ons: a tmate reverse shell and an
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel.
Uses a known Linux process name (bioset) to disguise the malicious process.
Uses a library injec on technique based on LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious processes.
Encrypts the malicious payload inside a binary to make automated sta c analysis more diﬃcult.
We believe that this new malware campaign is s ll under development due to its seemingly incomplete
codebase and infrastructure. At the me of wri ng, most of Hildegard’s infrastructure has been online
for only a month. The C2 domain borg[.]w was registered on Dec. 24, 2020, the IRC server went
online on Jan. 9, 2021, and some malicious scripts have been updated frequently. The malware
campaign has ~25.05 KH/s hashing power, and there is 11 XMR (~$1,500) in the wallet.
There has not been any ac vity since our ini al detec on, which indicates the threat campaign may
s ll be in the reconnaissance and weaponiza on stage. However, knowing this malware’s capabili es
and target environments, we have good reason to believe that the group will soon launch a larger-scale
a ack. The malware can leverage the abundant compu ng resources in Kubernetes environments for
cryptojacking and poten ally exﬁltrate sensi ve data from tens to thousands of applica ons running in
the clusters.
Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Run me
Protec on feature, Cryptominer Detec on feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes
Compliance Protec on, which alerts on an insuﬃcient Kubernetes conﬁgura on and provides secure
alterna ves.

Figure 1. A acker and malware’s movement.

Tac cs, Techniques and Procedures
Figure 1 illustrates how the a acker entered, moved laterally and eventually performed cryptojacking in
mul ple containers.
1. The a acker started by exploi ng an unsecured Kubelet on the internet and searched for containers
running inside the Kubernetes nodes. A er ﬁnding container 1 in Node A, the a acker a empted to
perform remote code execu on (RCE) in container 1.
2. The a acker downloaded tmate and issued a command to run it and establish a reverse shell to
tmate.io from container 1. The a acker then con nued the a ack with this tmate session.
3. From container 1, the a acker used masscan to scan Kubernetes’s internal network and found
unsecured Kubelets in Node B and Node C. The a acker then a empted to deploy a malicious crypto

5. The a acker could also create another tmate session from one of the containers (container 4). With
the reverse shell, the a acker could perform more manual reconnaissance and opera ons.
The indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in each container are listed below. These ﬁles are either
shell script or Executable Linkable Format (ELF). The IOC sec on at the end of the blog contains the
hash and details of each ﬁle.
Container 1: TDGG was dropped and executed via Kubelet. TDGG then subsequently downloaded
and executed tt.sh, api.key and tmate. The a acker used the established tmate connec on to
drop and run sGAU.sh, kshell, install_monerod.bash, setup_moneroocean_miner.sh
and xmrig (MoneroOcean).
Container 2-7: xmr.sh was dropped and executed via Kubelet.
Container 4: The a acker also established a tmate session in this container. The a acker then
dropped and executed pei.sh, pei64/32, xmr3.assi, aws2.sh, t.sh,
tmate,x86_64.so, xmrig and xmrig.so.
Figure 2 maps the malware campaign’s TTP to MITRE ATT&CK tac cs. The following sec ons will
detail the techniques used in each stage.

Figure 2. A acker’s tac cs, techniques and procedures.

Ini al Access
kubelet is an agent running on each Kubernetes node. It takes RESTful requests from various
components (mainly kube-apiserver) and performs pod-level opera ons. Depending on the
conﬁgura on, kubelet may or may not accept unauthen cated requests. Standard Kubernetes
deployments come with anonymous access to kubelet by default. However, most managed Kubernetes
services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Kubernetes
opera ons (Kops) all enforce proper authen ca on by default.

API and execu ng commands on running containers.

Execu on
Hildegard uses kubelet’s API to execute commands inside containers. The ini al commands create a
tmate reverse shell that allows the a acker to carry out the subsequent opera on. Unlike the
techniques that TeamTNT used in the past, this malware campaign did not pull or run any new
container image.

Privilege Escala on
Although Unit 42 researchers have not observed an a empt to perform privilege escala on, the
malware dropped two adversarial tools, Peirates and BOtB, which are capable of breaking out of
containers via known vulnerabili es or accessing cloud resources via exposed cloud creden als.

Container Breakout
BOtB can perform a container breakout using a known vulnerability such as CVE-2019-5736. It can
also escape from privileged containers that have enabled CAPS and SYSCALLS.

Access to Cloud Resources
Peirates can gather mul ple infrastructures and cloud creden als. It looks for iden ty and access
management (IAM) creden als from cloud metadata services and service account tokens from the
Kubernetes clusters. With the iden ﬁed creden als, it then further a empts to move laterally or gain
control of the cluster. While we observed Peirates in use, the container it was executed in had no
creden als.

Defense Evasion
Library Injec on
Hildegard uses LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious process launched inside the containers. The
malware modiﬁed the /etc/ld.so.preload ﬁle to intercept shared libraries’ imported func ons. In
par cular, the malware overwrites two func ons: readdir() and readdir64(), which are
responsible for returning the directory entries in the ﬁle system. The overwri en func ons ﬁlter out
queries made to directory entries under /proc. The func ons then drop queries with keywords such
as tmate, xmrig and ziggy. This way, when applica ons try to iden fy the running processes (by reading

Figure 3. Func on that overwrites readdir64() in X86_64.so.

Encrypted ELF Binary
Hildegard deploys an IRC agent built from the open-source project ziggystartux. To avoid being
detected by automated sta c analysis tools, the ziggystartux ELF is encrypted and packed in another
binary (ziggy). When the binary is executed, the ziggystartux ELF is decrypted by a hardcoded

Disguised Process Name
The malware names the IRC process “bioset”, which is the name of a well-known Linux kernel process
bioset. If one is only looking at the names of the running processes on a host, one can easily overlook
this disguised process.
DNS Monitoring Bypass
The malware modiﬁes the system DNS resolvers and uses Google’s public DNS servers to avoid being
detected by DNS monitoring tools.

Figure 5. DNS resolver modiﬁca on.

Delete Files and Clear Shell History
All the scripts are deleted immediately a er being executed. TeamTNT also uses the “history -c”
command to clear the shell log in every script.

Figure 6. The script clears the history and deletes itself.

Creden al Access
Hildegard searches for creden al ﬁles on the host, as well as queries metadata for cloud-speciﬁc
creden als. The iden ﬁed creden als are sent back to the C2.

Hildegard performs several reconnaissance opera ons to explore the environment.
It gathers and sends back the host’s OS, CPU and memory informa on.
It uses masscan to search for kubelets in Kubernetes’ internal network.

Figure 8. The script looks for system and network informa on.

Lateral Movement
Hildegard mainly uses the unsecured kubelet to move laterally inside a Kubernetes cluster. During the
discovery stage, the malware ﬁnds the exploitable kubelets and the containers these kubelets manage.
The malware then creates C2 channels (tmate or IRC) and deploys malicious crypto miners in these
containers. Although not observed by Unit 42 researchers, the a acker may also move laterally with
the stolen creden als.

Command and Control
Once gaining the ini al foothold into a container, Hildegard establishes either a tmate session or an IRC
channel back to the C2. It is unclear how TeamTNT chooses and tasks between these two C2 channels,
as both can serve the same purpose. At the me of wri ng, tmate sessions are the only way the
a acker interacts with the compromised containers. Unit 42 researchers have not observed any
commands in the IRC channel. However, the IRC server’s metadata indicates that the server was
deployed on Jan. 9, 2021, and there are around 220 clients currently connected to the server.

Impact
The most signiﬁcant impact of the malware is resource hijacking and denial of service (DoS). The
cryptojacking opera on can quickly drain the en re system’s resources and disrupt every applica on in
the cluster. The xmrig mining process joins the supportxmr mining pool using the wallet address

Hildegard: New TeamTNT Malware Targeting Kubernetes

Unlike a Docker engine that runs on a single host, a Kubernetes cluster typically contains more than
one host and every host can run mul ple containers. Given the abundant resources in a Kubernetes
infrastructure, a hijacked Kubernetes cluster can be more proﬁtable than a hijacked Docker host. This
new TeamTNT malware campaign is one of the most complicated a acks targe ng Kubernetes. This is
also the most feature-rich malware we have seen from TeamTNT so far. In par cular, the threat actor
has developed more sophis cated tac cs for ini al access, execu on, defense evasion and C2. These
eﬀorts make the malware more stealthy and persistent. Although the malware is s ll under
development and the campaign is not yet widely spread, we believe the a acker will soon mature the
tools and start a large-scale deployment.
Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Run me
Protec on features, Cryptominer Detec on and by the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance
Protec on, which alerts on an insuﬃcient Kubernetes conﬁgura on and provides secure alterna ves.
