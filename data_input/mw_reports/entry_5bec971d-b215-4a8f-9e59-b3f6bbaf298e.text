The Ryuk Ransomware uses the Wake-on-Lan feature to turn on powered off devices on a
compromised network to have greater success encrypting them.
Wake-on-Lan is a hardware feature that allows a powered down device to be woken up, or
powered on, by sending a special network packet to it. This is useful for administrators who
may need to push out updates to a computer or perform scheduled tasks when it is
powered down.
According to a recent analysis of the Ryuk Ransomware by Head of SentinelLabs Vitali
Kremez, when the malware is executed it will spawn subprocesses with the argument '8
LAN'.

When this argument is used, Ryuk will scan the device's ARP table, which is a list of known
IP addresses on the network and their associated mac addresses, and check if the entries
are part of the private IP address subnets of "10.", "172.16.", and "192.168."

Checking for private network
If the ARP entry is part of any of those networks, Ryuk will send a Wake-on-Lan (WoL)
packet to the device's MAC address to have it power up. This WoL request comes in the
form of a 'magic packet' containing 'FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF'.

Ryuk sending a WoL packet
If the WoL request was successful, Ryuk will then attempt to mount the remote device's C$
administrative share.

Mount drive to the Remote C$ Share
If they can mount the share, Ryuk will encrypt that remote computer's drive as well.
In conversations with BleepingComputer, Kremez stated that this evolution in Ryuk's tactics
allow a better reach in a compromised network from a single device and shows the Ryuk
operator's skill traversing a corporate network.
"This is how the group adapted the network-wide ransomware model to affect more
machines via the single infection and by reaching the machines via WOL & ARP," Kremez
told BleepingComputer. "It allows for more reach and less isolation and demonstrates their
experience dealing with large corporate environments."
To mitigate this new feature, administrators should only allow Wake-on-Lan packets from
administrative devices and workstations.
This would allow administrators to still benefit from this feature while adding some security
to the endpoints.
At the same time, this does not help if an administrative workstation is compromised, which
happens quite often in targeted ransomware attacks.
Update 1/14/20 11:28 AM: CrowdStrike also has analysis of this feature here.

Terrifying how much criminal energy goes into the development of RYUK ransomware.

Alovalovayea - 2 years ago

Hello, i've found SEVERAL WAYS to recover Ryuk encrypted files. I would be glad if
anyone could give me some sample because it could be useful in finding a way to
calculate the key instead of just recovering files. This ransomware is so advanced (in
terms of his code and process) that they forgot about some SIMPLE WINDOWS'S
ENVIROMENTS things that are helpful in recovering files.

Other than using external backup copies of files encrypted on the computer....what
other way have you found for "recovering" encrypted files other than decryting?
Inquiring minds want to know.

Just to tell you something, working on file history could let you recover everything on a
company network. Every workstation can help you decrypt another workstation, but I
can't give you details for now. Talking about any other method, would result on helping
the hacker team behind ryuk and that's why I want to use my samples (and some
more, If can get some) to calculate the key (it's not that difficult understanding how if
you analyze the infection through a network sniffer on a sandbox)

Sodinokibi (post August 2019 version) successfully decrypted thanks to a Facebook
group who submitted samples. Ryuk's taking a bit more time but it's "vulnerable to the
same method", could someone send samples?
