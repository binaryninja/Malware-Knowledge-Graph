Cybercrime is an evolving phenomenon and offenders are continuously adapting to find new
techniques to monetize their illicit activities. Our research paper and upcoming BlackHat
Europe presentation – EGO MARKET: When People’s Greed for Fame Benefits Large-Scale
Botnets – is about Linux/Moose, a botnet that conducts social media fraud. This blog post is
a summary of our paper.
Through our technical/social investigation, we found that the botnet is involved in a clever
scheme that combines a stealthy infrastructure, constant technological adaptation, the
inconspicuous activity of social media fraud with no direct victims, the ability to hide in plain
sight and a large potential for profitability.
Social media fraud is:
The process of creating false endorsements of social networks accounts in order to
enhance a user’s popularity and visibility. This can be achieved by liking posts (or any
similar endorsement) or following a user.
The clever scheme of Linux/Moose:

Stealthy

1/5

Linux/Moose only targets IoT devices. The lack of antivirus and security software available
for these devices allows the botnet to spread undetected. Moreover, the botnet is an
embedded system threat with no x86 architecture variant; it can only run on embedded
Linux systems of the MIPS and ARM architectures. This focus on embedded systems is rare
as even the well-known embedded threats like LizardStresser (Linux/Gafgyt) and the
recently discovered Mirai have x86 variants.
Since our industry’s best tools are built to detect and clean x86 threats, we can only deduce
that the botnet operators aimed to proactively stay under the radar.

Constantly Adapting
The Linux/Moose botnet was first discovered by the ESET research team in 2015 and their
analysis of the botnet was published in a technical report. The botnet’s infrastructure
changed following the report, illustrating how offenders can adapt once their activities are
exposed.
Linux/Moose Adaptations
1st change

The IP address of the C&C server is now XORed with a static value and
passed as an argument into the executables instead of hard-coded in binary
files. This means that out-of-context hunting by gathering files from Virus
Total (VT) is no longer a viable means to track the botnet.

2nd change

The SOCKSv4 TCP port used by the botnet operators to proxy their traffic
was updated from 10073 to 20012.

3rd change

Bot enrollment process changed and a correlation check was integrated
between the infecting party and the victim in the C&C server. Simply
mimicking an infected device and contacting the C&C is no longer sufficient
to be considered as a bot by the botnet.

4th change

The network protocol with the C&C server was updated. The new protocol
now mimics HTTP traffic on port 80 and the server displays a very common
“It works!” page.

These changes are further described in a blog post released by ESET.
Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Linux/Moose

2/5

To further study the real effect of this botnet on social networks, we needed to see the
traffic proxied by Linux/Moose’s infected devices. To do so, we built a custom honeypot,
deployed it worldwide and conducted an HTTPS man-in-the-middle attack on the proxied
traffic. The complete description of the honeypot’s architecture and the TLS attacks
conducted are presented in the report.
The attack gave us invaluable information on the botnet’s activities, such as which social
media sites were targeted, as well as detailed information about all the requests made on
each site.

No Direct Victims
Botnets are commonly known for distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), sending spam
or contributing to ad click fraud. We found that the Linux/Moose botnet operators are
branching out to new and less risky activities. All of Linux/Moose’s traffic aims at social
media fraud. This was achieved by sending requests to log in on the social networks, create
fake accounts and endorse other accounts. The most common fraud conducted by
Linux/Moose is following a user on Instagram.

Distribution of Linux/Moose traffic on different social media websites
As opposed to Ransomware, Social media fraud does not generate victims in need of
defending. Thus it is not an attractive target for law enforcement or for the international
security industry. The indirect victims of social media fraud are the entities or people that use
the number of followers and likes as a measure of the worth of a profile to hire a person, buy
products from the profile or pay for advertisements. Instead of requiring law enforcement
intervention, these victims are more likely to be more cautious in future transactions, thereby
giving a free pass to the botnet operators.

3/5

Hiding in Plain Sight
The Linux/Moose botnet operators can advertise on the clear Web, reaching large
exposure. Indeed, most sales of social media fraud go through websites and freelancer
platforms available through an easy search on Google. The price on Instagram is, on
average, US $112.67 for 10,000 follows. This is expensive considering that fake follows
from Linux/Moose do not last. The fake accounts are often quickly flagged as spam by
Instagram.
The nature of the demand shows how the fraud
is driven by an EGO Market. Not only are the
Linux/Moose operators selling their illegal
activity in plain sight, they reach a pool of
customers that are not criminalized.
The buyers of social media fraud found in
Linux/Moose traffic are mostly small
businesses, aspiring celebrities, and common people. Businesses centered around
individuals, such as the adjacent profile showing a corporate account focused on the owner,
were often found.

Large Potential Profitability
With a large botnet and all follows monetized, the operators of Linux/Moose are sitting on
a gold mine, as shown in the graph below. Indeed, if all follows conducted by Linux/Moose
on Instagram are monetized, the value generated by a single bot can go up to, on average,
13.05$ per month. However, to what extent the fraud is profitable for the botnet operators
remains unclear. It depends on several factors such as the number of follows monetized, the
size of the botnet and the number of actors sharing the money.

4/5

Regardless of the botnet’s overall profitability, the Linux/Moose botnet evolves in an
inconspicuous EGO market collecting money from normal people using regular credit cards.
Further, it advertises its services on the clear Web and does not attract the attention of law
enforcement. No connection to the criminal underworld is needed and there are no direct
victims, yet the money is generated through illicit activities.
In the end, the Linux/Moose botnet participates in a clever scheme: it falls into an interstice
that allows the botnet operators to continuously commit a cybercrime and profit from it in total
impunity.
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are available in the appendix section of the report and from
the ESET IoC repository.
