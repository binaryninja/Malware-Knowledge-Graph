In this report, we present a new Android banking malware that has been discovered
by our PTI team. We have dubbed the malware FluBot due to its lack of a prominent
name in the malware sample also because its spread rate and infection vector
resemble the common flu. At the time of this writing, FluBot is largely targeting Spain,
but the malware sample contains textual content for targeting German-, Polish-, and
English-speaking users. During the notification period with Spanish authorities, several
other researchers also published analysis report with the name “Cabassous“ however
no information about the C&C and victim statistics was available. The PTI team has
identified the following Android application names used by the FluBot campaign :
“Fedex,” “DHL,” “Correos,” and “Chrome.” The PTI team has deanonymized the C&C
server and discovered that FluBot has already infected more than 60,000 victims and
stolen over 11 million phone numbers. FluBot has all of the generic banking malware
features such as overlay attack and SMS stealing for OTP, but the key differences are
that it :
the part of request sent to the C&C server using RSA
• Encrypts
Uses
the
contact
lists of victims for spreading over SMS phishing messages
• Uses a domain generation
algorithm (DGA) for determining the C&C server
• address

• Uses

• Does

FluBot - Malware Analysis Report

Executive Summary
This report is based on findings obtained from the analysis made of FluBot malware. FluBot
is a new Android banking malware that uses overlay attacks to perform webview-based
application phishing. The malware mainly targets mobile banking and cryptocurrency
applications but also gathers a wide range of user data from all installed applications on a
given device.
Upon installation, FluBot malware instantly starts tracking applications being launched
on the device. Once it detects a target application launch, the malware starts an overlay
attack. FluBot downloads the specially crafted login page of the opened target application
from the C&C server. The downloaded webview phishing page is then laid over the target
application. The user suspects nothing because this event happens almost instantaneously
when the legitimate application is opened. Once the application credentials are entered
into the overlayed phishing page, FluBot malware sends the credentials to the C&C server
controlled by the attacker.
The FluBot malware also has the following capabilities :
Listening notifications
Reading and writing SMS messages
Getting contact lists
Performing calls

Analyst Note : Taking a closer look at the links in SMS phishing messages reveals that the
threat actors are using different hacked web application servers in almost every message.
This shows the FluBot operation’s level of sophistication, which distinguishes it from other
consumer-grade banking malware.
Following the links inside the SMS phishing messages takes the victims to a legitimate website
hacked by the threat actors. Hacked web application servers are configured to contain
the malicious APK file to requests with Android User-Agent. At the time of the PTI team’s
investigation, attackers were using FedEx-themed campaigns. A sample phishing page is

com.tencent.mm - DGA

FluBot uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to obtain the address of the C&C server.
The DGA creates 2000 domains according to the current year and month. Domains consist
of 15 characters with “com,” “ru,” and “cn” TLDs. The relevant DGA code is given in Figure 10 .

Analyst Note : Normally, when the button in the confirmation popup is pressed immediately,
the application shows an error message saying “Please read the message.” When same
button is pressed after waiting for approximately 3-4 seconds, it directs the user to the
accessibility settings.
Malware uses accessibility to perform different activities such as the overlay attack. If the
targeted package name exists in the triggered event, FluBot takes the texts on the screen,
starts the BrowserActivity, and creates an overlay with the help of accessibility. The related

The malware automatically obtains “ignore battery optimizations” rights via accessibility.

Analyst Note : Generally, Android banking malware has two main ways of running in the
background without being visible to the user. The first way is to avoid having to start itself
as a foreground service by obtaining the “ignore battery optimizations” permission. The
second way is to start itself as a foreground service and delete notifications from the
notification bar with the help of the notification listener. FluBot opts for the first of these
methods.

Command and Control Panel

At the time of analysis, the domain generation algorithm of the FluBot was dissected and
active C&C servers were identified by the PTI team. The root directory of the C&C server
contains a message from the threat actor intended for the analysts. Message contains the
text “Добро пожаловать, пиздюки-разведчики. Вам всего доброго, хорошего настроения
и здоровья” and a video of Dmitry Medvedev.

Figure 23. Command and Control Panel Greeting Message

Our threat intelligence team was able to analyze the C&C panel by deanonymizing the
FluBot servers. The botnet panel is designed as a rudimentary PHP management dashboard
with little to no detail. Despite its simplistic view, the control panel was able to handle around
60,000 infected device connections without any performance issues.

Statistics

The C&C panel also contains detailed statistics of the infected victims. At the time of
analysis, FluBot had already infected more than 60,000 devices. Over 97% of the victims
seemed to be based in Spain. Total number of collected phone numbers appears to be
more than 11 million as of writing this report.

The statistics page of the panel also contains details about the device manufacturers,
Android version, device language, and telecommunication operator name. When FluBot
successfully obtains the banking credentials, they are sent to the C&C and stored with the
following Figure 27 log format.

Each log entry for the infected device may contain the SMS messages, banking credentials,

FluBot - Malware Analysis Report

Conclusion

The number of mobile banking malware types has been increasing significantly over the past
five years. FluBot sets a new precedent of spreading methods and DGA implementations.
During a very short timeframe, FluBot is able to infect more than 60,000 mobile phones.
Currently there are more than 11 million phone numbers collected from the infected devices
which represents 25% of the total population in Spain. We estimate that the malware is
cabaple to collect almost all phone numbers in Spain within 6 months time if no action
is taken. In other malware families, the SMS spreading functionality tends not to work as
effectively. However, the SMS spreading functionality of FluBot (Smishing module) is well
implemented and works in nearly all setups. In addition to the spreading method, its novel
DGA approach makes it almost impossible to sinkhole the threat with traditional techniques.
It should also be noted that FluBot can easily be adapted to spread to different countries
with a simple configuration change in its codebase. Our PTI team monitors all known and
as-yet-unknown APT groups daily. FluBot is not associated with any known groups as of
writing this report.
