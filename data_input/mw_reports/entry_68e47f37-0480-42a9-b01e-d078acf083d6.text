Microsoft investigates Iranian attacks against the Albanian government
microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/08/microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government
September 8, 2022

Shortly after the destructive cyberattacks against the Albanian government in mid-July, the Microsoft Detection and Response
Team (DART) was engaged by the Albanian government to lead an investigation into the attacks. At the time of the attacks
and our engagement by the Albanian government, Microsoft publicly stated that “Microsoft is committed to helping our
customers be secure while achieving more. During this event, we quickly mobilized our Detection and Response Team
(DART) to help the Albanian government rapidly recover from this cyber-attack. Microsoft will continue to partner with Albania
to manage cybersecurity risks while continuing to enhance protections from malicious attackers.” This blog showcases the
investigation, Microsoft’s process in attributing the related actors and the observed tactics and techniques observed by DART
and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) to help customers and the security ecosystem defend from similar
attacks in the future.
Microsoft assessed with high confidence that on July 15, 2022, actors sponsored by the Iranian government conducted a
destructive cyberattack against the Albanian government, disrupting government websites and public services. At the same
time, and in addition to the destructive cyberattack, MSTIC assesses that a separate Iranian state-sponsored actor leaked
sensitive information that had been exfiltrated months earlier. Various websites and social media outlets were used to leak this
information.

There were multiple stages identified in this campaign:
Initial intrusion
Data exfiltration
Data encryption and destruction
Information operations
Microsoft assessed with high confidence that multiple Iranian actors participated in this attack—with different actors
responsible for distinct phases:
DEV-0842 deployed the ransomware and wiper malware
DEV-0861 gained initial access and exfiltrated data
DEV-0166 exfiltrated data
DEV-0133 probed victim infrastructure
Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat
activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of
the actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, the DEV reference is converted to a named actor:
Microsoft assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the
attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was
detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs;
however, some of them may work for the same unit.
Information specific to Albania is shared with permission from the Albanian government.

Forensic analysis
Evidence gathered during the forensic response indicated that Iran-affiliated actors conducted the attack. This evidence
includes, but is not limited to:
The attackers were observed operating out of Iran
The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian
attackers
The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are
consistent with Iranian interests
The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor
The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors

Intrusion and exfiltration

2/17

A group that we assess is affiliated with the Iranian government, DEV-0861, likely gained access to the network of an Albanian
government victim in May 2021 by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability on an unpatched SharePoint Server,
administrata.al (Collab-Web2.*.*), and fortified access by July 2021 using a misconfigured service account that was a member
of the local administrative group. Analysis of Exchange logs suggests that DEV-0861 later exfiltrated mail from the victim’s
network between October 2021 and January 2022.
DEV-0861 was observed operating from the following IPs to exfiltrate mail:
144[.]76[.]6[.]34
176[.]9[.]18[.]143
148[.]251[.]232[.]252
Analysis of the signals from these IPs, and other sources, indicated that DEV-0861 has been actively exfiltrating mail from
different organizations in the following countries since April 2020:

Figure 2. Timeline of data exfiltration activities by DEV-0861
The geographic profile of these victims—Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE—aligns with Iranian
interests and have historically been targeted by Iranian state actors, particularly MOIS-linked actors.
DEV-0166 was observed exfiltrating mail from the victim between November 2021 and May 2022. DEV-0166 likely used the
tool Jason.exe to access compromised mailboxes. A public analysis of Jason.exe can be found here. Note that this tool was
reportedly used by actors affiliated with MOIS.

Ransomware and wiper
The cyberattack on the Albanian government used a common tactic of Iranian state sponsored actors by deploying
ransomware first, followed by deployment of the wiper malware. The wiper and ransomware both had forensic links to Iranian
state and Iran-affiliated groups. The wiper that DEV-0842 deployed in this attack used the same license key and EldoS
RawDisk driver as ZeroCleare, a wiper that Iranian state actors used in an attack on a Middle East energy company in mid2019. In that case, IBM X-Force assessed that actors affiliated with EUROPIUM gained initial access nearly a year ahead of
the wiper attack. The wiper attack was subsequently performed by a separate and unknown Iranian actor. This is similar to the
chain of events Microsoft detected against the Albanian government.
The code used in this attack had the following properties:

Embedded in the cl.exe wiper was the hex-string
‘B4B615C28CCD059CF8ED1ABF1C71FE03C0354522990AF63ADF3C911E2287A4B906D47D,’ which was the same license
key used for the EldoS RawDisk driver of the ZeroCleare wiper documented by IBM X-Force in 2019. The Eldos driver is a
legitimate tool that was also abused by the ZeroCleare wiper and was used to delete files, disks, and partitions on the target
systems. While ZeroCleare is not widely used, this tool is being shared amongst a smaller number of affiliated actors including
actors in Iran with links to MOIS.
The ransomware payload used in this attack by the DEV-0842 operator had the following properties:

GoXml.exe

f116acc6508843f59e59fb5a8d643370dce82f492a217764521f46a856cc4cb5

This tool was signed with an invalid digital certificate from Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC. This certificate had a
SHA-1 thumbprint of 55d90ec44b97b64b6dd4e3aee4d1585d6b14b26f.
Microsoft telemetry indicates this certificate was only used to sign 15 other files—a very small footprint, suggesting the
certificate was not widely shared amongst unrelated actor groups. Multiple other binaries with this same digital certificate were
previously seen on files with links to Iran, including a known DEV-0861 victim in Saudi Arabia in June 2021:

It’s not clear if Read.exe was dropped by DEV-0861 on this Saudi victim or if DEV-0861 also handed off access to the Saudi
victim to DEV-0842.

Additional indications of Iranian state sponsorship
The messaging, timing, and target selection of the cyberattacks bolstered our confidence that the attackers were acting on
behalf of the Iranian government. The messaging and target selection indicate Tehran likely used the attacks as retaliation for
cyberattacks Iran perceives were carried out by Israel and the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group largely
based in Albania that seeks to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Messaging
The attacker’s logo is an eagle preying on the symbol of the hacking group ‘Predatory Sparrow’ inside the Star of David
(Figure 4). This signals the attack on Albania was retaliation for Predatory Sparrow’s operations against Iran, which Tehran
perceives involved Israel. Predatory Sparrow has claimed responsibility for several high-profile and highly sophisticated
cyberattacks against Iran state-linked entities since July 2021. This included a cyberattack that disrupted television
programming of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) with images saluting MEK leaders in late January. Predatory
Sparrow forewarned about the attack hours ahead of time and claimed they supported and paid for it, indicating others were
involved. Iranian officials blamed this cyberattack on the MEK and additionally blamed the MEK and Israel for a cyberattack
that used the same images and messaging against the Tehran municipality in June.
The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK, a long-standing adversary of the Iranian regime, was the primary
target behind their attack on the Albanian government. The ransom image, like several posts by Homeland Justice, the group
overtly pushing messages and leaking data linked to the attack, asked “why should our taxes be spent on terrorists of Durres.”
This is a reference to the MEK, who Tehran considers terrorists, who have a large refugee camp in Durrës County in Albania.

5/17

Figure 4. Ransomware image and Homeland Justice banner
The messaging linked to the attack closely mirrored the messaging used in cyberattacks against Iran, a common tactic of
Iranian foreign policy suggesting an intent to signal the attack as a form of retaliation. The level of detail mirrored in the
messaging also reduces the likelihood that the attack was a false flag operation by a country other than Iran.
The contact numbers listed in the ransom image (Figure 4), for example, were linked to multiple senior Albanian leaders,
mirroring the cyberattacks on Iran’s railways and fueling pumps, which included a contact phone number belonging to
the Iranian Supreme Leader’s Office.
The messages in the information operations also emphasized targeting of corrupt government politicians and their
support for terrorists and an interest in not harming the Albanian people (Figure 5). Similarly, the attack on Iranian steel
companies claimed to target the steel factories for their connections to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)
while avoiding harm to Iranians. Another cyberattack on an Iranian airline in late 2021, which was claimed by
Hooshyaran-e Vatan (meaning “Observants of the Fatherland” in Farsi), emphasized Tehran’s corruption and
misappropriation of money on IRGC activities abroad.

Timing

6/17

The cyberattack on July 15 occurred weeks after a string of cyberattacks on Iran, one week ahead of the MEK-sponsored
Free Iran World Summit and aligned with other Iranian policy moves against the MEK, further bolstering the likelihood of
Iranian involvement. On July 16, the day after the cyberattack, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement
designating current and former American politicians for supporting the MEK. The Free Iran World Summit, which the Iranian
regime actively opposes, was canceled this year following warnings of possible terrorist threats to the Summit on July 21. A
few days after the planned Free Iran World Summit, Iranian official press issued an editorial calling for military action against
the MEK in Albania. This string of events suggests there may have been a whole-of-government Iranian effort to counter the
MEK from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to intelligence agencies, to official press outlets.

Target selection
Some of the Albanian organizations targeted in the destructive attack were the equivalent organizations and government
agencies in Iran that experienced prior cyberattacks with MEK-related messaging. This suggests the Iranian government
chose those targets to signal the cyberattacks as a form of direct and proportional retaliation, a common tactic of the regime.

Parallel information operations and amplification
Before and after the Homeland Justice messaging campaign was launched, social media persona accounts and a group of
real-life Iranian and Albanian nationals known for their pro-Iran, anti-MEK views, promoted the campaign’s general talking
points and amplified the leaks published by the Homeland Justice accounts online. The parallel promotion of the Homeland
Justice campaign and its central themes by these entities in the online space—before and after the cyberattack—suggests a
broad-based information operation aimed at amplifying the impact of the attack.
Ahead of the cyberattack, on June 6, Ebrahim Khodabandeh, a disaffected former MEK member posted an open letter
addressed to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warning of the consequences of escalating tensions with Iran. Invoking
“[h]acking of Tehran municipal systems” and “gas stations,” Khodabandeh claimed that the MEK was the source of
“sabotaging acts against the interests of the Iranian people [sic]” and argued that these constituted “the hostile work of your
government” and has caused “obvious enmity with the Iranian nation [sic].”
Four days later, on June 10, Khodabandeh and the Nejat Society, an anti-MEK NGO that he heads, hosted a group of
Albanian nationals in Iran. The group included members of another anti-MEK organization called the Association for the
Support of Iranians Living in Albania (ASILA)—Gjergji Thanasi, Dashamir Mersuli, and Vladimir Veis. Given the highly political
nature of ASILA’s work on issues related to a group that Tehran considers a terrorist organization (the MEK), it is highly
possible that this visit was conducted with sanction from the state. Upon their return from Iran, on July 12, Nejat Society said
Albanian police raided their offices and detained some ASILA members. While Nejat Society said this raid was a result of
“false and baseless accusations,” according to local media the raid stemmed from possible connections to Iranian intelligence
services.

Vladimir Veis.
In the wake of the cyberattack, on July 23, Thanasi and Olsi Jazexhi, another Albanian national who frequently appears on
Iran’s state-sponsored media outlet PressTV espousing anti-MEK positions, penned a second open letter addressed to thenAlbanian President Ilir Meta, also published on Nejat Society’s website. This letter echoed Homeland Justice’s central claim—
namely that Albania’s continuing to host the MEK constituted a danger to the Albanian people. Jazexhi and Thanasi called on
Meta to convene Albania’s National Security Council to “consider whether Albania has entered into a cyber and military
conflict with the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
In May 2021, at around the same time that Iranian actors began their intrusion into Albanian government victim systems,
accounts for two anti-MEK social media personas, which do not appear to correspond to real people, were created on both
Facebook and Twitter. The accounts largely post anti-MEK content and engage with the social media accounts of some of the
individuals detailed above. These two accounts along with a third, older account, were among the first to promote posts from
Homeland Justice accounts on Twitter, and all three dramatically increased the rate of anti-MEK posts after the mid-July 2022
cyberattack became public.
There exists some additional evidence that the role of these personas extended beyond mere social media amplification and
into content production. One of the personas which repeatedly posted Homeland Justice content had previously written for the
now-defunct IRGC-linked American Herald Tribune and other fringe news sites, often in negative terms about the MEK. A
second persona account, meanwhile, may have attempted to contact at least one Albanian newspaper ahead of the hackand-leak, requesting “cooperation”, and the ability to publish with the outlet.
The parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these individuals and personas online
both before and after the cyberattack adds a compelling human dimension to the broader Homeland Justice influence effort.
While there were no observed direct relationships between the threat actors responsible for the destructive attack and these
messaging actors, their actions raise questions worthy of further examination.

Observed actor activity
DART and MSTIC supported the post ransom and wiper attack analysis leveraging Microsoft 365 Defender and collection of
additional forensic artifacts. Analysis identified the use of vulnerabilities to implant web shells for persistence, reconnaissance
actions, common credential harvesting techniques, defense evasion methods to disable security products, and a final attempt
of actions on objective deploying encryption and wiping binaries. The Iranian sponsored attempt at destruction had less than a
10% total impact on the customer environment.

Access and implant
Based on investigative analysis, starting in May 2021, actors exploited vulnerabilities of a public-facing endpoint to execute
arbitrary code that implanted web shells on the unpatched SharePoint server (Collab-Web2.*.*), as stated previously. These
generic web shells provided the ability to upload files, download files, delete files, rename, execute commands with an option
to run as specific user.

The web shell console from the attacker’s point of view
Web shells were placed in the following directories:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server
Extensions\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\evaluatesiteupgrade.cs.aspx
C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Pickers.aspx
C:\ProgramData\COM1\frontend\Error4.aspx

Lateral movement and execution
Following initial access and implant, the threat actor was observed using Mimikatz for credential harvesting and a combination
of Impacket and Remote Desktop Clients for lateral movement efforts using the built-in administrator account. Unrecoverable
tooling was identified, which highly suggests that reconnaissance efforts were present in the form of file names of
executables, resident mailbox data, database, and user details. Similar actions by the threat actors observed by MSTIC and
DART detail both custom and open-source tooling utilized for these efforts. Artifacts of tooling identified:
IPGeter.exe
FindUser.exe
recdisc.exe
NetE.exe
advanced_port_scanner.exe
mimikatz.exe
shared.exe
Stored CSV and TXT files

Data collection

9/17

During the period of October 2021 – January 2022, the threat actors used a unique email exfiltration tool which interacted with
the Exchange web services APIs to collect email in a manner that masked the actions. The threat actors accomplished these
actions by creating an identity named “HealthMailbox55x2yq” to mimic a Microsoft Exchange Health Manager Service account
using Exchange PowerShell commands on the Exchange Servers. The threat actors then added the account to the highly
privileged exchange built-in role group “Organization Management” to later add the role of “Application Impersonation”. The
ApplicationImpersonation management role enables applications to impersonate users in an organization to perform tasks on
behalf of the user, providing the ability for the application to act as the owner of a mailbox.

Defense evasion
Prior to launching the final stage of the attack, the threat actors gained administrative access to a deployed endpoint detection
and response (EDR) solution to make modifications, removing libraries that affected the agents across the enterprise. In
addition, a binary to disable components of Microsoft Defender Antivirus was propagated using custom tooling. The
distributed binary named disable-defender.exe queries for TokenElevation using the GetTokenInformation API and checks if
the process is running with elevated privileges. If the token is not running with elevated privilege, the binary prints “Must run
as admin!\n”. If the token is elevated, it queries TokenUser and checks if the SID is “S-1-5-18”. If the current process doesn’t
run under system context, it prints “Restarting with privileges\n” and attempts to elevate the privilege.
To elevate the privilege, the binary checks if the TrustedInstaller service is enabled. To do this, it starts the service
“SeDebugPrivilege” and “SeImpersonatePrivilege” to assign privileges to itself. It then looks for winlogon.exe process,
acquires its token, and impersonates calling thread using ImpersonateLoggedOnUser/SetThreadToken. After impersonating
as winlogon.exe, it opens TrustedInstaller process, acquires its token for impersonation and creates a new process with
elevated privileges using CreateProcessWithTokenW.

Once it successfully creates its own process with TrustedInstaller privilege, it proceeds to disable Defender components.

Actions on objective
Distribution of the encryption and wiping binaries was accomplished with two methods via a custom SMB remote file copy tool
Mellona.exe, originally named MassExecuter.exe. The first method remote file copied the ransom binary GoXml.exe and a bat
file that triggers the execution of the ransom or wiper on a user login. The second method was by remotely invoking the
ransom binary with the Mellona.exe tool, post SMB remote file copy.
