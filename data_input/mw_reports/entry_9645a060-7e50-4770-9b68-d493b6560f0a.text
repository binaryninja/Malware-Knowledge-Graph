Update: Following our disclosure of these malicious packages, the legitimate library "uaparser-js" used by millions was itself was found to be compromised. We have released a
subsequent blog post covering the "ua-parser-js" compromise.
Sonatype’s automated malware detection system has caught multiple malicious packages on
the npm registry this month. These packages disguise themselves as legitimate JavaScript
libraries but were caught launching cryptominers on Windows, macOS and Linux machines.
The malicious packages are:
okhsa
klow
klown
“klow, klown” have been tracked under Sonatype-2021-1472. Whereas, “okhsa” has been
cataloged under Sonatype-2021-1473.
Different versions of the “okhsa” package largely contain skeleton code that launches the
Calculator app on Windows machines pre-installation. But additionally, these versions
contain either the “klow” or the “klown” npm package as a dependency—which is malicious.
The manifest file, package.json, for “okhsa” shows “klown” listed as a dependency.

All of these packages were published by the same author whose account has since been
deactivated:

The Sonatype security research team discovered that “klown” had emerged within hours of
“klow” having been removed by npm. “Klown” falsely touts itself to be a legitimate JavaScript
library “UA-Parser-js” to help developers extract the hardware specifics (OS, CPU, browser,
engine, etc.) from the “User-Agent” HTTP header.

But, Sonatype security researcher Ali ElShakankiry who analyzed these packages explains,
“Packages ‘klow’ and ‘klown’ contain a cryptocurrency miner. These packages detect the
current operating system at the preinstall stage, and proceed to run a .bat or .sh script
depending on if the user is running Windows, or a Unix-based operating system.”
“These scripts then download an externally-hosted EXE or a Linux ELF, and execute the
binary with arguments specifying the mining pool to use, the wallet to mine cryptocurrency
for, and the number of CPU threads to utilize.”

One of the Batch scripts found in the “klown” package are shown below:

The script downloads the “jsextension.exe” from a Russia-based host 185.173.36[.]219.
The EXE is a known cryptominer, as previously flagged by VirusTotal. For Linux and macOS
installations, an identical Bash script downloads the “jsextension” ELF binary from the same
host.
Shown below is a screenshot from a test run of the crypto mining EXE, generated via
any.run. Note, the malicious EXE runs quietly in the background on an infected machine, but
for the purposes of demonstration we are showing how the process would appear if it wasn't
hidden:

It isn’t clear how the author of these packages aims to target developers. There are no
obvious signs observed that indicate a case of typosquatting or dependency hijacking.
“Klow(n)” does impersonate the legitimate UAParser.js library on the surface, making this
attack seem like a weak brandjacking attempt.

The Sonatype security research team reported these malicious packages to npm on October
15, 2021, hours after their release, and the packages were taken down the same day by the
npm security team.

Evolving open source supply-chain attacks warrant advanced
protection
Once again, this particular discovery is a further indication that developers are the new target
for adversaries over the software they write. Sonatype has been tracing novel brandjacking,
typosquatting, and cryptomining malware lurking in software repositories. We’ve also found
critical vulnerabilities and next-gen supply-chain attacks, as well as copycat packages
targeting well-known tech companies.
The good news is, over the past few weeks, our automated malware detection system has
caught thousands of suspicious packages on npm. These components are either confirmed
malicious, previously known to be malicious, or dependency confusion copycats.
We are now expanding our malware detection capabilities via Nexus Intelligence to other
ecosystems as well, such as PyPI.
All of this takes more than just due diligence and luck – it takes the expertise of experienced
security professionals and hundreds of terabytes of data. In order to keep pace with malware
mutations, Sonatype analyses every newly-released npm package to keep developers safe.
We help you remain proactive and safeguard your software supply chains against up-andcoming attacks. Our AI/ML-powered automated malware detection system (which is part of
Nexus Firewall and powered by Nexus Intelligence data), and security research team work
together for full-spectrum protection. Nexus determines a likely malicious component based
on historical supply chain attacks and over five-dozen “signals.” This insight enables flagging
for potential new attacks before security researchers discover them.

As soon as our system flags a package or a dependency as “suspicious,” it undergoes a
quarantine queue for manual review by the Sonatype Security Research Team. Users of
Nexus Firewall are then protected from these suspicious packages while the review is
underway. Existing components are quarantined before they are pulled “downstream” into a
developer’s open source build environment.
Moreover, users that have enabled the “Dependency Confusion Policy” feature will get
proactive protection from dependency confusion attacks. This works whether conflicting
package names exist in a public repository or in your private, internal repos.

detection technology safeguards your developers, customers, and software supply chain
