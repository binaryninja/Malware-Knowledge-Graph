Clandestine Fox, Part Deux
fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/06/clandestine-fox-part-deux.html

We reported at the end of April and the beginning of May on an APT threat group leveraging
a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer via phishing email attacks. While Microsoft
quickly released a patch to help close the door on future compromises, we have now
observed the threat actors behind “Operation Clandestine Fox” shifting their point of attack
and using a new vector to target their victims: social networking.
An employee of a company in the energy sector recently received an email with a RAR
archive email attachment from a candidate. The attachment, ostensibly containing a resume
and sample software program the applicant had written, was from someone we’ll call “Emily”
who had previously contacted the actual employee via a popular social network.
FireEye acquired a copy of the suspicious email – shown below in Figure 1 – and attachment
from the targeted employee and investigated. The targeted employee confirmed that
“Emily” had contacted him via the popular social network, and that, after three weeks
of back and forth messaging “she” sent her “resume” to his personal email address.

Figure 1: Sample email

illustrating how “Emily” attacks a victim employee[/caption]
Working our way backwards, we reviewed “Emily’s” social network profile and noticed a few
strange aspects that raised some red flags. For example, “her” list of contacts had a number
of people from the victim’s same employer, as well as employees from other energy
companies; “she” also did not seem to have many other “friends” that fit “her” alleged
persona. “Her” education history also contained some fake entries.
Further research and discussions with the targeted company revealed that “Emily,” posing as
a prospective employee, had also contacted other personnel at the same company. She
had asked a variety of probing questions, including inquiring who the IT Manager was
and what versions of software they ran – all information that would be very useful for an
attacker looking to craft an attack.
It’s worth emphasizing that in the instances above, the attackers used a combination of
direct contact via social networks as well as contact via email, to communicate with
their intended targets and send malicious attachments. In addition, in almost all cases, the
attackers used the target’s personal email address, rather than his or her work
address. This could be by design, with a view toward circumventing the more
comprehensive email security technologies that most companies have deployed, or also due
to many people having their social network accounts linked to their personal rather than work
email addresses.
Details - Email Attachment #1
The resume.rar archive contained three files: a weaponized version of the open-source
TTCalc application (a mathematical big number calculator), a benign text copy of the TTCalc
readme file, and a benign PDF of Emily’s resume. The resume was a nearly identical copy
of a sample resume available elsewhere on the Internet. The file details are below.

Upon execution, ttcalc.exe drops the two files listed below, and also launches a
legitimate copy of TTCalc v0.8.6 as a decoy:
%USERPROFILE%/Application Data/mt.dat
%USERPROFILE%/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/vc.bat

The file mt.dat is the actual malware executable, which we detect as
Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter. (Variants of this family of backdoor are also referred to as
“Pirpi” in the security industry). In this case, the malware was configured to use the following
remote servers for command and control:

Clandestine Fox)

Details - Email Attachment #2
Through additional research, we were able to obtain another RAR archive email attachment
sent by the same attackers to an employee of another company. Note that while there are a
lot of similarities, such as the fake resume and inclusion of TTCalc, there is one major
difference, which is the delivery of a completely different malware backdoor. The
attachment name this time was “my resume and projects.rar ,” but this time it was
protected with the password “ TTcalc .”

SETUP.exe is a self-extracting RAR, which opens the WinRAR window when executed,

prompting the user for the location to extract the files. It writes them to a TTCalc folder and
tries to launch ttcalcBAK.exe (the malware dropper), but the path is incorrect so it fails
with an error message. All of the other files are benign and related to the legitimate TTCalc
application.

The file ttcalcBAK.exe is also a self-extracting Rar which drops and launches
chrome_frame_helper , which is a Backdoor.APT.Kaba (aka PlugX/Sogu) backdoor
using a legitimate Chrome executable to load the malicious DLL via side-loading.
Although this backdoor is used by multiple threat groups and is quite commonly seen these
days, this is the first time we've observed this particular threat group using this family
of malware. The malware was configured to communicate to the command and control
domain www[.]walterclean[.]com (72.52.83.195 at the time of discovery) using the
binary TCP protocol only. The file details are below, followed by the malware configuration.

Conclusion
In short, we attributed these attacks to the same threat actor responsible for “Operation
Clandestine Fox,” based on the following linkages:
The first-stage malware (mt.dat) is a slightly updated version of the
Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter malware dropped during Operation Clandestine Fox
6/7

Based on our intel, Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter has been used exclusively by this
particular threat group
Finally, the command and control domain inform[.]bedircati[.]com seen in this activity
was also used during the Clandestine Fox campaign
Another evolutionary step for this threat group is that they have diversified their tool usage
with the use of the Kaba/PlugX/Sogu malware – something we have never seen them do
before.
As we have noted in other blog posts, APT threat actors take advantage of every possible
vector to try to gain a foothold in the organizations they target. Social networks are
increasingly used for both personal and business reasons, and are one more potential threat
vector that both end-users and network defenders need to think about.
Unfortunately, it is very common for users to let their guard down when using social
networks or personal email, since they don’t always treat these services with the
same level of risk as their work email. As more companies allow their employees to
telecommute, or even allow them to access company networks and/or resources using their
personal computers, these attacks targeting their personal email addresses pose significant
risk to the enterprise.
