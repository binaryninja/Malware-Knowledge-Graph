go report A+

blackCatConf is a static configuration extractor implemented in Golang for BlackCat Ransomware
(targeting Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux + VMware ESXi). By default the script will print the
extracted information to stdout. It is also capable of dumping the malware configuration to disk as a
JSON file with the -j flag.
Info: This tool does currently not support the new version of BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware.

Usage
go run blackcatconf.go [-j] path/to/blackcat_sample.bin

Configuration structure
With these novel BlackCat Ransomware samples this config extractor could easily be replaced by a
bash one-liner (e.g. strings ... | grep "{\"config_id" > config.json ), but I expect that there
will be config obfuscation/encryption added in future samples of BlackCat, similar to e.g. the changes
made in Darkside Ransomware over time. If this is the case here as well having a structure to
unmarshal the json config into will save me some time down the road.
Speaking of Darkside/BlackMatter: The configuration structure and values of BlackCat share significant
similarities with those found in BlackMatter. The Korean Threat Intelligence company S2W Lab
published a thorough analysis of the similarities between these two Ransomware strains.
