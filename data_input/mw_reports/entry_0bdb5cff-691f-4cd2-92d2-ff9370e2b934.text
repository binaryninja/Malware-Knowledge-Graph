Dragon Messenger
■ Background of “ Dragon Messenger” APT Operation

ESRC (ESTsecurity Security Response Center) has recently discovered the
stealthy mobile APT attack carried out by Geumseong121 APT hacking group.
The hacker group also distributed a malicious app (APK) via the site disguised
as a fundraising service for supporting North Korean defectors.
The website is built on WordPress platform, and the domain was created on
August 23, 2019, and updated on October 22.
The snapshots displayed from September 11 to October on the timeline
indicates that it is the charity site supporting North Korean defectors, and the
Android app installation link (Google Play) was added in October.
The site disguised as a charity website tricks North Korean defectors and North
Korea- related organizations into installing the apps using the promotion
strategies in many different forms.
ESRC has named the operation "Dragon Messenger" based on the several
interesting factors found in the campaign, such as the malicious application
that collects the data via the 'DragonTask' path and the attack performed by
disguised as a secure messenger.

[ Figure 1] The sites disguised as fundraising organizations supporting North
Korean defectors
Since the above fundraising sites for supporting North Korean defectors were
made, they have been spread via various channels (email, SNS) along with
guidelines of the related apps, mainly targeting those who work in the North
Korea- related field.
Besides, it became known to the public with the promotion using the comments
written by the ID 'David Kim' who introduces himself as the administrator of the
website that is related to the North Korea- related field.

[ Figure 2] Comments posted on media site covering North Korea- related
issues
Many words and expressions written in North Korean were found during the
website investigation process. It is highly likely that such expressions exist in
reality because it is a North Korean defector- related site.
ESRC has conducted a thorough investigation on the YouTube site run by the
same administrators as those of the Android apps that were distributed on the
site when two apps were registered on the official Google Play Store, all of
which have currently been removed by Google.
The application informs that North Korean defectors can share their life- related
issues, get the support they need, and specify donation services.

[ Figure 3] Application registered on Google Play

In the application image displayed in the official Google Play Market, there is
'계정 창조 (North Korean expression, which means creating an account)'
button. For reference, this is usually referred to as "계정 생성 (South Korean
expression, which means creating an account)" in South Korea. That is, both
‘ 창조’ and ‘ 생성’ mean ‘ creation’ in English.
Also, the only Wi- Fi connection was likely used for performing a screenshot
capture, which seems to be because the SIM card was not inserted on the
smartphone.

Cosmosfarm- based board for posting social comments had been included on
the site until October 23, but the bulletin board was removed around October
28. The deleted board had YouTube links and comments saying that the writers
prefer the site.

[ Figure 5] Use of the app registered on YouTube

YouTube videos to show how to use the Korean smartphone provides
information on the installation of the application and the guidance on how to
use the installed application. The attacker performs malicious activities on
Facebook with the same account as YouTube, with about 330 friends
registered.

This suggests that attackers have prepared the attack in advance using
Facebook, and the registered friends can be exposed to a potential threat.

[ Figure 6] Registered on Facebook

The YouTube video shows a demo of installing an application on the
smartphone. Taking a closer look at scenes from the video reveals that the
hacker logged in with the name 'Lee Mi- Kyung' and the account 'borisanatoly'
when creating the video.

‘ Lee Mi- Kyung’ is the first person who wrote a post in an app service on
September 20, 2019, at 14:10.

The 'David Kim' account, possibly the administrator of the website, posted
several comments on September 20 at 14:20. It seems that the attacker posted
the comments that appeared as the conversation between two persons using
the two different accounts every 10 minutes.

Also, the name 'Lee Mi Kyung' left on the information on the official Google
Play app indicates that two accounts were closely related from the beginning
and that one person managed both accounts.

The APT hacker planned a highly strategic tactic scenario to gather the attack
targets by developing the community- based charity app for North Korean
defectors.
Gathering North Korean defectors in the specific cyberspace enabled the
hackers secretly spy on the defectors’ conversation as well as create monetary
profit by collecting donations and promoting the site with advertisements.
ESRC believes that such malicious activities of the Geumseong121 hacker
group will be the signal ‘ a new mobile threat’ in the future.

■ Smart threat disguised as a charity site for supporting North Korean
defectors

The hacker group behind the attack created and distributed the multiple
malicious apps, and disguised them as the messengers mainly used for secret
chats.
One of the apps disguised as sponsoring North Korean defectors was officially
registered in the official Google Play market. When joining the membership of
the site using the email account except for Kakao or Naver, the username and
password entered by the user using the 'createUserWithEmailAndPassword'
method will be used to create the account 'Firebase' and log in to the site.
In addition, the account information is stored in plain text in the 'config.xml' file
in the 'shared_prefs' path of the app, exposing users to the potential security
threats.

ESRC focused on collecting the additional threat evidences in addition to the
possibility of account disclosure threats upon initial SignUp, regarding the latest
version registered on Google Play's official market, and found other similar
codes in the analyzing process.
We also found a connection between the recently found campaign and the
previous mobile infringement by Geumseong 121 APT hacker group during the
analyzing process of the additional codes.

■ Targeted attack using KakaoTalk message

Many malicious apps that attempts an installation have been detected from
June 2019 until recently.
The attackers steal the names and profile images of certain people who live in
the United States, create their KakaoTalk accounts, and attempt to access to
South Koreans who are working in the North Korea- related field.

KakaoTalk users can add friends only with their phone numbers, which could
help the attackers to abuse the list of phone numbers to select attack targets.

The attacker attempts to impersonate a vice president and an advisory board of
The Korean American Association, or a researcher at the Institute of Peace.

[ Figure 9] Distribution of malicious apps using KakaoTalk Messenger

The attacker pretends to be the researcher at the Institute of Peace in the US in
KakaoTalk dialogue, tricks victims into believing that he has been collecting the
North Korea- related information, and suggests the conversation with a secure
messenger app while encouraging users to click the specific URL link to install
a malicious app disguised as messenger app.
The attacker has disguised himself as secured messengers, such as the
‘ Threema’ developed in Swiss and ‘ Wickr ‘ made in the US.
The malicious apps provide most of the functions that a normal secure
messenger has, to avoid users’ suspicion and all of these apps perform similar
functions.
The apps are highly similar to the Android malicious apps found in the
‘ Geumsoeng121 APT hacker group performing the attack targeting smartphones
using the steganography technique' released on August 5.

[ Figure 10] Comparison of internal codes by malicious app type

The investigation reveals that the victims of malicious apps disguised as
overseas secure messengers were also exposed to the attack disguised as the
charity site supporting North Korean defectors.

The same functions were found in an earlier version of a malicious app, but not
in the final version found in the official Google Play market.

[ Figure 11] Comparison of the malwares disguised as a secure messenger and
the charity site for NK defectors

It seems that the attackers made and effort to avoid the suspicion that the
North Korean fundraising apps are originated from the previously discovered
malicious apps.
However, the initial version of those malicious apps includes the functionality
that attempts to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex.
We also found that some variable declarations used by malicious apps are
almost identical to the previously found malicious apps.

secure messenger and the charity site for NK defectors

In addition, we have gained many artifacts to show that the two malwares have
high similarity in the path that the attackers used for performing malicious
commands, the data they stolen, and the additionally downloaded data.

■ Eavesdropping attacks using Android smartphone

ESRC is paying attention to investigate the threat activities of the statesponsored APT hacking group 'Geumseong121' targeting Android smartphone
users.
The ‘ zombied’ smartphones, which are exploited in cyber operations, has
emerged as an important threat that should not be overlooked.
Several attempts to steal SMS and phone address books, eavesdrop on a
phone conversation and leak the KakaoTalk messages appearing in the
notification window have been discovered until recently.
It is also worth noting that the quite popular celebrities have been exposed to
the 'Dragon Messenger' APT attack.
When an Android smartphone is exposed to mobile threat, not only personal
privacy, but also the contents of institutional and corporate meetings and
photos in the gallery will be leaked in real time.
ESRC has found that many smartphone users in a wide range of fields have been
‘ zombied’ in the tracking and analyzing process of the mobile APT attack. It was
quite surprising that most of the victims are unaware of the infection and the
infected smartphones have been monitored by attackers for a long period.
