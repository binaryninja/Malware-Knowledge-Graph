This month, the Splunk Threat Research team developed a total of seven analytic stories
addressing different types of threats and more than a dozen of new detections to help our
customers detect and fight against these threats.
In this blog post, we’ll walk you through two analytic stories and a few detection searches
that we want to highlight from the February 2021 releases. Watch the video below to learn
more about why Splunk's Rod Soto, Principal Security Research Engineer, and Michael
Haag, Senior Threat Researcher, think it is important to share their knowledge on emerging
threats such as Cloud Federated Credential Abuse and Cobalt Strike.

Cloud Federated Credential Abuse
The Cloud Federated Credential Abuse analytic story addresses the recently notorious
campaigns featuring tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that target the extraction of
credentials in cloud federated environments. These environments are composed by
federation-enabling technologies such as Active Directory Federation Services, and these
federations can be from inside the perimeter or between cloud vendors.
Federations are based in the flow of trusted credentials. These trusted credentials allow the
seamless interaction of entities from perimeter to cloud or from cloud to cloud. Current
federation credential frameworks such as OAuth2 and SAML are the most popular in use
between federated environments. In this research blog we delve into how these credentials
operate and how these attacks work within the perimeter and between cloud environments.
The scenarios addressed in this new analytic story (release v3.15) are the Golden SAML
attack and Pass The Cookie. Specially the Golden SAML scenario, which is reported to be
one of the attack techniques involved during the SolarWinds campaign. We are including
detection and hunting searches for endpoint and cloud vendors such as AWS and Azure.
We decided to approach the federation attacks from two different fronts:
Perimeter: The servers and endpoints where we find the elements to craft forge
requests, including items such as SAML assertions or session cookies, private keys
and certificates.
Cloud provider: The providers of federation services where the extracted credentials
are reused.

Detecting Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is threat emulation software that Red Teams, penetration testers and threat
actors all use. More recently, adversaries have used cracked or leaked versions to perform
post exploitation within the target’s environment. In December 2020 we got a rare glimpse
into FireEye’s Red Team tools after an actor gained unauthorized access. As a defender,

we may not always have access to a tool like Cobalt Strike, so we need to research it to
better understand how we may generate our content. With Cobalt Strike comes the ability to
deploy what are called Malleable C2 profiles. Each profile is a customization to how the
beacon payload will blend in with the network and endpoint. It may be as short or detailed
as the operator needs. If unable to customize, there are many profiles freely available.
Functions within the Malleable C2 profile are: spawnto_x86 and spawnto_x64.
Spawnto_ is a process that Cobalt Strike opens to inject shellcode into. The default
spawnto_ process is rundll32.exe.
Top five publicly available spawnto values identified in Malleable C2 profiles:

In generating content related to Cobalt Strike, consider the following:
1. Is it normal for spawnto_ value to have no command line arguments? No command
line arguments and a network connection?
2. What is the default, or normal, process lineage for spawnto_ value?
3. Does the spawnto_ value normally make network connections?

Content is currently in active development and much more is to come. We want to help
organizations of all sizes begin to advance their detection capabilities against Cobalt Strike
and more.

Why Should You Care?
Some of these attack vectors are new and evolving and they seem to emulate past lateral
movement techniques such as pass the hash or pass the ticket. Many vendors do not
consider these attack vectors as vulnerabilities but rather an abuse of features. These types
of attacks are bound to become more popular as enterprises continue to implement cloud
services.
Cobalt Strike is the baseline adversary tool we defenders need to ensure we have coverage
for moving forward in 2021. With the increasing usage of leaked versions of Cobalt Strike,
content needs to be created to detect and ultimately prevent the capabilities it provides. In
addition, defenders need to understand what malicious looks like and how to respond to
activity related to methodologies using Cobalt Strike.

About the Splunk Threat Research Team
The Splunk Threat Research team is devoted to understanding actor behavior and
researching known threats to build detections that the entire Splunk community can benefit
from. The Splunk Threat Research team does this by building and open-sourcing tools that
analyze threats and actors like the Splunk Attack Range and using these tools to create
attack data sets. From these data sets, new detections are built and shared with the Splunk
community under Splunk Security Content. These detections are then consumed by various
Splunk products like Enterprise Security, Splunk Security Essentials and Mission Control to
help customers quickly and effectively find known threats.

Contributors
We would like to thank Rod Soto, Michael Haag, Patrick Bareiss and Bhavin Patel for their
contributions to this post, as well as all of the community contributors who provided
feedback and helped generate new security content.
