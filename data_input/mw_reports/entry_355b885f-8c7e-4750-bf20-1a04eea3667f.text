Symantec has identified a new attack group dubbed Orangeworm
deploying the Kwampirs backdoor in a targeted attack campaign
against the healthcare sector and related industries.
Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Orangeworm that has been
observed installing a custom backdoor called Trojan.Kwampirs within large international
corporations that operate within the healthcare sector in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
First identified in January 2015, Orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against
organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach
their intended victims. Known victims include healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, IT
solution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers that serve the healthcare
industry, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage.

Sights set on healthcare
Based on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or
conduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully and
deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack.

Figure 1. Nearly 40 percent of Orangeworm’s victims operate within the healthcare industry
According to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm’s confirmed victim
organizations operate within the healthcare industry. The Kwampirs malware was found on
machines which had software installed for the use and control of high-tech imaging devices
such as X-Ray and MRI machines. Additionally, Orangeworm was observed to have an
interest in machines used to assist patients in completing consent forms for required
procedures. The exact motives of the group are unclear.

The biggest number of Orangeworm’s victims are located in the U.S., accounting for 17
percent of the infection rate by region. While Orangeworm has impacted only a small set of
victims in 2016 and 2017 according to Symantec telemetry, we have seen infections in
multiple countries due to the nature of the victims operating large international corporations.

Healthcare providers caught in the crosshairs
We believe that these industries have also been targeted as part of a larger supply-chain
attack in order for Orangeworm to get access to their intended victims related to healthcare.
Orangeworm’s secondary targets include Manufacturing, Information Technology,
Agriculture, and Logistics. While these industries may appear to be unrelated, we found them
to have multiple links to healthcare, such as large manufacturers that produce medical
imaging devices sold directly into healthcare firms, IT organizations that provide support
services to medical clinics, and logistical organizations that deliver healthcare products.

Post-compromise activities

3/7

Once Orangeworm has infiltrated a victim’s network, they deploy Trojan.Kwampirs, a
backdoor Trojan that provides the attackers with remote access to the compromised
computer.
When executed, Kwampirs decrypts and extracts a copy of its main DLL payload from its
resource section. Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts a randomly generated string
into the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detections.
To ensure persistence, Kwampirs creates a service with the following configuration to ensure
that the main payload is loaded into memory upon system reboot:

The backdoor also collects some rudimentary information about the compromised computer
including some basic network adapter information, system version information, and language
settings.
Orangeworm likely uses this information to determine whether the system is used by a
researcher or if the victim is a high-value target. Once Orangeworm determines that a
potential victim is of interest, it proceeds to aggressively copy the backdoor across open
network shares to infect other computers.
It may copy itself to the following hidden file shares:
ADMIN$
C$WINDOWS
D$WINDOWS
E$WINDOWS

Information gathering
At this point, the attackers proceed to gather as much additional information about the
victim’s network as possible, including any information pertaining to recently accessed
computers, network adapter information, available network shares, mapped drives, and files
present on the compromised computer.
We have observed the attackers executing the following commands within victim
environments:

No concern about being discovered

5/7

Kwampirs uses a fairly aggressive means to propagate itself once inside a victim's network
by copying itself over network shares. While this method is considered somewhat old, it may
still be viable for environments that run older operating systems such as Windows XP. This
method has likely proved effective within the healthcare industry, which may run legacy
systems on older platforms designed for the medical community. Older systems like
Windows XP are much more likely to be prevalent within this industry.
Additionally, once infected, the malware cycles through a large list of command and control
(C&C) servers embedded within the malware. It appears while the list is extensive, not all of
the C&Cs are active and continue to beacon until a successful connection is established.
Despite modifying a small part of itself while copying itself across the network as a means to
evade detection, the operators have made no effort to change the C&C communication
protocol since its first inception.
Both of these methods are considered particularly “noisy” and may indicate that Orangeworm
is not overly concerned with being discovered. The fact that little has changed with the
internals of Kwampirs since its first discovery may also indicate that previous mitigation
methods against the malware have been unsuccessful, and that the attackers have been
able to reach their intended targets despite defenders being aware of their presence within
their network.

No hallmarks of a nation-state actor
While Orangeworm is known to have been active for at least several years, we do not
believe that the group bears any hallmarks of a state-sponsored actor—it is likely the work of
an individual or a small group of individuals. There are currently no technical or operational
indicators to ascertain the origin of the group.
