United Nations1

O

ne of the many seemingly
intractable legal issues surrounding cyberspace involves
whether and when peacetime
cyber operations constitute a prohibited use of
force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations
(UN) Charter. Notwithstanding a significant
body of scholarly work on this topic and
extensive real-world examples from which to
draw, there is no internationally recognized
definition of a use of force.2 Rather, what has
emerged is a general consensus that some
cyber operations will constitute a use of force,
but that it may not be possible to identify in

advance the specific criteria states will use in
making such determinations.
As discussed in this article, several analytic frameworks have been developed to help
assess when cyber operations constitute a use
of force.3 One conclusion these frameworks
share is that cyber operations resulting in
physical damage or injury will almost always
be regarded as a use of force. When these
frameworks were developed, however, there
were few, if any, examples of peacetime, statesponsored cyber coercion. More importantly,
the prospect of cyber attacks causing physical
damage was largely theoretical.4 Beginning

Lieutenant Colonel Andrew C. Foltz, USAF, wrote this essay while a student at the Air War College. It won
the Strategic Research Paper category of the 2012 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategic Essay
Competition.

in 2007, however, a string of cyber operations—including the 2007 Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack on Estonia, the 2008
DDoS attack on Georgia, and the 2008 discovery that the U.S. Government’s most sensitive
networks had been compromised—hinted at
increased use of the cyber domain by states
and their proxies for peacetime coercion.
Then, with the discovery of the Stuxnet worm

difficulty applying it in the cyber context. I
then review Schmitt’s model and perform
a Schmitt Analysis of Stuxnet. Finally, I
examine what the analysis of Stuxnet reveals
about the framework’s continued utility
and relevance. Overall, I find that Schmitt’s
underlying analytical approach remains
sound—that is, the best way to characterize
the lawfulness of peacetime cyber operations

the need for clarity has taken on greater importance now
that the United States and many of its allies
treat cyberspace as a military operational domain
in 2010, which damaged uranium enrichment
equipment at a nuclear facility in Iran, theory
became reality.
Although Stuxnet has been described
as a watershed event, there has been little academic discussion on whether it constituted a
use of force.5 Perhaps this is because it caused
physical damage and, therefore, clearly constitutes a use of force under prevailing analytic
frameworks. This appears to be the emerging
consensus.6 Although I generally agree with
this conclusion, I also believe that by looking
beyond the physical damage, Stuxnet provides
a unique opportunity to assess the adequacy
and continued relevancy of these frameworks.
As a first step toward such an assessment, this article tests one of the more
robust frameworks, known as the Schmitt
Analysis, by applying it to Stuxnet. Developed in 1999 by Professor Michael Schmitt,
it is one of the most academically rigorous
and frequently cited frameworks for characterizing cyber operations. The Schmitt
Analysis consists of seven factors that states
are likely to consider when characterizing cyber activities: severity, immediacy,
directness, invasiveness, measurability,
presumptive legitimacy, and responsibility.
A key feature of the framework is that it
remains faithful to Article 2(4) of the UN
Charter while at the same time effectively
bridging key elements of competing analytic
frameworks that do not exhibit such fidelity
to the Charter. By focusing this evaluation
on Schmitt’s model, I expect the results will
have implications for the use-of-force debate
more generally.
The article begins with a discussion
of why, as a practical matter, discerning a
peacetime use-of-force threshold in cyberspace is important. Next, I detail the Article
2(4) prohibition on the use of force and the
n d u p res s .ndu.edu

is to predict how states will characterize them.
That said, the Stuxnet analysis reveals several
limitations with Schmitt’s framework, while
also highlighting opportunities to broaden it.
More importantly, I conclude that the time
has come to relax the model’s strict adherence
to the UN Charter because Article 2(4) is just
one of several factors that states are likely to
consider when characterizing the lawfulness
of cyber operations.

Why the Use-of-Force
Threshold Matters
Cyberspace represents a strategic
vulnerability for many states because it is
inextricably tied in to their economies, critical infrastructures, and even their national
security apparatus. Compounding these
concerns is the fact that a wide range of
actors have proven adept at exploiting these
vulnerabilities. Cybercrime, for example, is
now estimated to exceed $1 trillion globally
per year.7 Even the most secure U.S. defense
networks are not immune.8 The scope of the
problem has become so great that some claim
the United States is engaged in a cyber war,
and that it is losing.9 The National Security
Strategy of 2010 notes that “cybersecurity
threats represent one of the most serious
national security, public safety, and economic
challenges we face as a nation.”10 The White
House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace
of 2011 goes further by proclaiming: “When
warranted, the United States will respond to
hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any
other threat to our country,” to include a military response.11
Against this backdrop, discerning a
cyber use-of-force threshold becomes important for a number of reasons. Foremost is that
characterizing cyber operations is a precondition to determining which legal regime

governs state behavior.12 If state-sponsored
cyber activities constitute a use of force,
then international law governing the use of
force (jus ad bellum) and the Law of Armed
Conflict (jus in bello) apply. In appropriate
circumstances, this could trigger a state’s right
to self-defense and thereby permit a forceful,
perhaps even armed response. In contrast,
non-state-sponsored cyber operations and
operations not amounting to a use of force are
traditionally governed by more constrained
law enforcement regimes.13
The need for clarity has taken on greater
importance now that the United States and
many of its allies treat cyberspace as a military
operational domain.14 Accordingly, discerning
a use-of-force threshold would seem to be necessary for a wide range of peacetime military
activities, such as defining the spectrum of
permissible peacetime cyber operations, such
as computer network exploitation; developing peacetime cyber rules of engagement;
identifying appropriate approval authorities;
assigning appropriate agency responsibilities
and resources; signaling adversaries and allies
as part of a deterrence strategy; recognizing
when treaty obligations have been triggered;
and determining whether UN Security
Council authorization is required to conduct
certain operations.

The Use of Force in Cyberspace
Notwithstanding the need for clarity
discussed above, there is no international
consensus on what constitutes a use of force in
cyberspace, nor does it appear a mechanical
rule is likely to emerge any time soon.15 This
section describes why ambiguity persists and
the various solutions that have been proposed
to resolve it. After summarizing the relevant
law governing the use of force in international
relations, I highlight the technical, legal, and
political challenges of applying existing norms
within cyberspace.
Use of Force Under the UN Charter.
Jus ad bellum16 describes the law governing
the transition from peace to armed conflict.
Though grounded in customary international
law, the black letter principles of jus ad bellum
are now contained in Article 2(4) of the UN
Charter, which prohibits states from the
“threat or use of force” in their international
relations. Several features of this prohibition
are problematic in the cyber context. First,
Article 2(4) only pertains to international
relations between sovereign states—it does
not proscribe the conduct of nonstate actors,
issue 67, 4 th quarter 2012 / JFQ    41

essay winners | Cyber “Use-of-Force” Debate
who appear to be the source of most malicious cyber activity. Also, as noted above,
the Charter does not define the phrase use of
force. Finally, Article 2(4) does not provide
any exceptions to the prohibition on the
unilateral use of force, nor does it prescribe
remedies for unauthorized uses of force. Such
exceptions and remedies are found in chapter
VII of the Charter which, unlike Article 2(4),
is not limited to relations between states and
employs thresholds quite distinct from the
use-of-force standard.17 Importantly, it is not
the use of force, but rather an “armed attack”
that triggers a state’s right to use force in
self-defense.18
Although use of force is not defined,
an approximate threshold has emerged
through consideration of the Charter’s
preparatory work, state practice, and
opinio juris.19 First, the framers of the

v. United States (hereinafter Nicaragua),
when it concluded that arming and training guerrillas amounted to a prohibited
use of force, even though it did not rise to
the level of an armed attack.25 Accordingly,
the use of force threshold has traditionally
been viewed as lying somewhere between
purely economic and political coercion on
the one hand and activities that result in
physical damage or injury on the other. 26
As discussed below, discerning a clear
use-of-force threshold in this gray area—a
difficult task even in traditional kinetic
context—has proven particularly difficult
in the cyber context.27
Use of Force in Cyberspace. The difficulty of applying Article 2(4) in cyberspace
is that the instrument-based paradigm does
not cleanly translate to cyber operations,
particularly for gray area operations that do

discerning the use-of-force threshold is really about
predicting how states will respond to cyber incidents in
light of prevailing international norms
Charter took an instrument-based, vice
consequence-based, approach to the use of
force prohibition.20 While acknowledging
that states are most concerned about the
consequences of coercive activities (that
is, the degree of injury, deprivation, or
destruction), the framers recognized that a
consequence-based criterion was too subjective to distinguish lawful from unlawful
state coercion.21 Because the term force
connotes violence, injury, and destruction—consequences that pose the greatest
threat to international peace and security—
they adopted the instrument-based use-offorce standard as prescriptive shorthand.
According to Professor Schmitt, such an
approach “eases the evaluative process by
simply asking whether force has been used,
rather than requiring a far more difficult
assessment of the consequences that have
resulted.”22 According to this approach, the
Article 2(4) prohibition does not extend to
all forms of state coercion. For example,
the instruments of economic and political
coercion are not prohibited. 23 Less clear,
but generally accepted, is that the prohibition is not limited to “armed” force—it
may also encompass unarmed, nonmilitary
physical force, such as releasing water
from a dam.24 The International Court of
Justice highlighted this point in Nicaragua

42    JFQ / issue 67, 4 th quarter 2012

not result in physical harm.28 According to a
strict instrument-based interpretation, even
highly disruptive peacetime cyber operations
may not qualify as a use of force because they
lack the traditional kinetic characteristics
associated with armed force.29 Most commentators reject this strict interpretation because
of the potential widespread destabilizing
consequences of cyber operations. That said,
by focusing on consequences to determine
whether prohibited force has been used, these
commentators call Article 2(4)’s instrumentbased paradigm into question.
The perceived shortcomings of Article
2(4) have led many to propose a new treaty law
to govern cyber operations.30 Others counter
that states are unlikely to negotiate any
meaningful treaties in the foreseeable future.
They argue that divergent strategic interests
and significant attribution problems make
treaty enforcement unrealistic. They suggest
that existing international norms, though
imperfect, are adequate for extrapolating
general principles governing the use of force
in cyberspace and urge gradual expansion of
international norms within the Article 2(4)
framework.
Over the past two decades, proponents
of this gradualist approach have developed
several analytic frameworks to characterize
the legality of cyber operations. First is the

“effects-based” approach, which states that
the quantum of damage, and not the means
of attack, is all that matters. The advantage of
this approach—which is generally favored by
U.S. policymakers and military operators—is
that it is fairly simple to apply and it acknowledges that states are principally concerned
about consequences. The drawback is that it
represents a hard break from the Charter’s
instrument-based approach and thereby relies
on inherently subjective assessments among
states that have divergent strategic capabilities, vulnerabilities, and interests. A second
approach relies upon kinetic equivalency,
arguing that cyber operations constitute a
use of force only if the damage they cause
could previously have been achieved only by
a kinetic attack.31 This framework generally
adheres to the Charter’s instrument-based
approach, but it struggles to characterize
hostile gray area cyber operations—such as
projecting false targets on an adversary’s early
warning radars—that do not result in physical
damage. A third approach applies a “strict
liability” test for any cyber operations that
target a state’s critical infrastructure and vital
interests because of the severe consequences
that could result from such attacks. According
to this model, the mere penetration of such
systems—such as power production, stock
exchanges, and air traffic control—can constitute evidence of hostile intent and thereby
trigger the right of self-defense.32 This framework suffers from the inherent subjectivity
of defining what constitutes “critical infrastructure and vital interests,” and because it
expands the gray area to encompass activities
such as computer network exploitation that
are not currently prohibited by international
law. Professor Schmitt’s framework represents
the fourth major model.

Schmitt Analysis
Professor Schmitt recognized that
discerning the use-of-force threshold is really
about predicting how states will characterize
and respond to cyber incidents in light of prevailing international norms.33 To aid in such
predictions, his framework bridges the instrument- and consequence-based approaches.
In keeping with the Article 2(4) instrumentbased standard, his model consists of seven
factors that represent the major distinctions
between permissible (that is, economic and
political) and impermissible (armed) instruments of coercion.34 When applying these
factors, the more closely the attributes of a
ndupres s . ndu. edu

FOLTZ
cyber operation approximate the attributes
of armed force, the more likely states are to
characterize the operation as a prohibited use
of force. The Schmitt Analysis factors consist
of the following:

According to Professor Schmitt,
evaluating these factors is an imprecise and
subjective endeavor. The factors are useful
but not determinative, and they should not be
applied mechanically. Rather, they need to be
applied holistically according to the relevant
context—that is, which factors are important
and how they should be weighted will vary
on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, he never
intended the factors to be exhaustive, though
they are often treated as such.36 Finally, the
framework is more useful for post hoc forensic
analysis of particular cyber attacks than for
characterizing real-time operations.37
Professor Schmitt also acknowledged
that his adherence to the Article 2(4)

instrument-based paradigm appears tortuous, particularly given the appeal of simple
effects-based frameworks. However, he
reasoned that such adherence is necessary to
properly describe where the cyber use of force
threshold lies under prevailing standards—in
contrast to the other leading models, which
prescribe new standards for where the use of
force threshold should lie.38 He also believed
that “reference to the instrument-based shorthand facilitates greater internal consistency
and predictability within the preexisting
framework. . . . As a result, subscription by
the international community is more likely,
and application should prove less disruptive
and controversial.”39 In the end, the Schmitt
Analysis has generally stood the test of time
and remains one of the most commonly referenced frameworks for characterizing the use
of force in cyberspace.

Characterizing Stuxnet
Stuxnet has been described as a game
changer—the first digital “fire and forget”
precision-guided munition and perhaps the
first peacetime act of cyberwar.40 According

U.S. Air Force (Lance Cheung)

■■ Severity: Cyber operations that
threaten physical harm more closely approximate an armed attack. Relevant factors in the
analysis include scope, duration, and intensity.
■■ Immediacy: Consequences that manifest quickly without time to mitigate harmful
effects or seek peaceful accommodation are
more likely to be viewed as a use of force.
■■ Directness: The more direct the causal
connection between the cyber operation and
the consequences, the more likely states will
deem it to be a use of force.
■■ Invasiveness: The more a cyber
operation impairs the territorial integrity or
sovereignty of a state, the more likely it will be
viewed as a use of force.
■■ Measurability: States are more likely to
view a cyber operation as a use of force if the
consequences are easily identifiable and objectively quantifiable.

■■ Presumptive legitimacy: To the extent
certain activities are legitimate outside of the
cyber context, they remain so in the cyber
domain, for example, espionage, psychological
operations, and propaganda.
■■ Responsibility: The closer the nexus
between the cyber operation and a state, the
more likely it will be characterized as a use
of force.35

to reports, the Stuxnet worm was designed to
target gas centrifuges used in Iran’s uranium
enrichment program in Natanz. Specifically,
the worm exploited the software used in
programmable logic controllers (PLCs) manufactured by Siemens. These PLCs controlled
frequency converter drives that, in turn, controlled the speed of the centrifuges. By manipulating the speed of already temperamental
and frequency-sensitive centrifuges over time
(weeks and perhaps months), Stuxnet caused
as many as 1,000 of the centrifuges to break.
Estimates suggest Stuxnet set Iran’s nuclear
program back by several years.41
Although some have described Stuxnet’s
code as a relatively unsophisticated “Frankenstein patchwork of existing tradecraft,
code and best practices drawn from the global
cyber-crime community,” its true sophistication lies in the synergy of its components
and its method of infection.42 First, Stuxnet’s
designers required incredibly precise intelligence about Iran’s PLCs and frequency
converters, as well as the performance
parameters of its centrifuges.43 Second, the
malware was self-replicating and designed to
infect systems that were not connected to the
Internet (“air-gapped”), thereby requiring the
use of intermediary devices such as thumb
drives. Stuxnet also employed four “zero-day”
exploits44 and two stolen digital signatures
to gain access to targeted systems. Finally,
Stuxnet appears to have been designed to

44    JFQ / issue 67, 4 th quarter 2012

avoid collateral damage.45 If the malware did
not detect the specific software-hardware configuration associated with Iran’s enrichment
program, the program would lie dormant. It
was also designed to delete itself from thumb
drives after infecting three machines, and
it contained a built-in self-destruct feature.
Thus, even though the worm is reported to
have infected more than 100,000 hosts in 155
countries, 60 percent of the infections were
localized to Iran, and there are no reports of
physical damage outside of Iran.46 Although
no one has claimed responsibility for Stuxnet,
it has the signature of a state operation.47 Most
speculation and some anecdotal evidence
points to Israel, with possible support from
the United States and/or Germany.48
Although there is an emerging consensus that Stuxnet constituted a use of force,
there is value in looking beyond the physical
damage to see what the operation reveals
about the strengths and weaknesses of existing analytic frameworks, such as the Schmitt
Analysis. Accordingly, the following analysis
is offered not only to characterize Stuxnet, but
to help evaluate Schmitt’s framework.
Severity: According to this criterion,
Stuxnet is per se a use of force because it
caused physical damage. Moreover, the
damage was inflicted upon a critical Iranian
interest—its nuclear program. By setting
Iran’s nuclear program back several years,
the duration of Stuxnet’s consequences also

supports characterizing it as a use of force—
though this delay is due to sanctions that bar
Iran from legitimately acquiring new centrifuges. It is also worth noting that the scope
of the actual damage appears to have been
relatively minor and fairly discrete, and that it
posed no apparent risk of harm to personnel.
Immediacy: According to this factor,
Stuxnet would probably not be viewed as a
use of force. The attack, which consisted of at
least three waves over 10 months, took time
to evolve.49 More importantly, once a targeted
system was infected, it appears the damage
took weeks or even months to manifest. Given
the nature of how the attack unfolded, there
was and remains adequate opportunity for
Iran to mitigate the harmful effects and to
seek peaceful accommodation. That said,
given the physical damage inflicted, immediacy is probably not a factor that warrants
much emphasis in this analysis.
Directness: There appears to be a direct
causal connection between Stuxnet and the
damaged centrifuges.
Invasiveness: Stuxnet represents a
significant intrusion on Iranian sovereignty.
Not only does it appear to have crossed international borders, but it targeted sensitive and
highly secure systems that were air-gapped
from the Internet. That said, Stuxnet would
have been just as invasive if it had simply
collected intelligence on the inner workings
of the Natanz facility—an activity the internandupres s . ndu. edu

FOLTZ
Responsibility: Although no state has
claimed responsibility for Stuxnet, the worm’s
purpose and design strongly suggest state
involvement. That said, it is possible that
Stuxnet was created and launched by nonstate
actors—such as Iranian dissidents working
with freelance hackers—in which case it
would not be subject to international laws
governing the use of force.
On balance, the Schmitt Analysis suggests most states would characterize Stuxnet
as a use of force. The worm was highly invasive, caused direct and measurable physical
damage, lacked a clear presumption of legitimacy, and probably involved state support.
What does the foregoing analysis of
Stuxnet reveal about the continued usefulness of Professor Schmitt’s framework? Most
importantly, the model’s underlying analytic
approach appears sound—that is, discerning
the use of force threshold entails predicting
how states will characterize cyber operations.
That said, the analysis reveals several limitations with the framework, as well as opportunities for its expansion.
First, it appears that in any given
Schmitt Analysis, the characterization of

a cyber operation may be derived from a
single factor: severity of the consequences.
If true, then the framework could arguably
be reduced to an effects-based model with
little remaining affinity with the Article 2(4)
instrument-based paradigm. To illustrate the
point, what if instead of damaging Iranian
centrifuges Stuxnet achieved the same effects
by causing the centrifuges to operate inefficiently or not at all? Except for severity, each
of Schmitt’s factors would likely be evaluated
the same. It is debatable, though, whether
the international community would consider
such an operation a prohibited use of force.
This is not to suggest that the other factors
are irrelevant, but it highlights what Professor
Schmitt himself acknowledged: “severity is
self-evidently the most significant factor in
the analysis.”51
Next, the characteristics of Stuxnet
and its intended target suggest at least one
additional factor that may be relevant when
performing a Schmitt Analysis: apparent
compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict
(LOAC).52 Assuming reports are true, the
fact that Stuxnet was targeted so precisely
and designed to minimize collateral damage

U.S. Navy (Joshua J. Wahl)

tional community would likely not regard as a
use of force.
Measurability: Taking into account the
already high failure rate of Iran’s centrifuges,
the consequences attributed to Stuxnet appear
both quantifiable and identifiable.
Presumptive legitimacy: Stuxnet does
not enjoy presumptive legitimacy. Short of
UN Security Council authorization or actions
taken in self-defense—both of which would
constitute lawful uses of force—there is no
customary acceptance within the international community for damaging another
state’s nuclear facilities. Even so, it is worth
considering the effect of existing Iranian
sanctions upon this analysis. First, Iran
cannot import or export nuclear-related materials or technology. If such Iranian-owned
nuclear materials are discovered outside
of Iran, they can be lawfully seized and
destroyed. Second, prior to Stuxnet, Iran had
been operating its centrifuges for several years
in violation of multiple UN Security Council
Resolutions.50 Although these points may
relate more to whether Stuxnet constituted a
lawful use of force, they also seem to bear on
the factor of presumptive legitimacy.

reveals something about the identity and
intent of its creators. First, it reinforces the
notion that Stuxnet was a state-sponsored
operation, which is important because Article
2(4) only regulates state conduct. Second, it
suggests Stuxnet’s creators were concerned
about complying with LOAC, particularly the
principles of military necessity, distinction,
and proportionality.53 Thus, the responsible
state apparently regarded Stuxnet as the
equivalent of an armed attack and executed
the operation as such. Since an armed attack
constitutes a use of force, the implication is
that states are more likely to characterize
cyber attacks as a use of force if they appear to
comply with LOAC—even in gray area operations that do not result in actual damage.
A third observation involves one of
the most technically challenging aspects of
cyber operations: attribution. For Article 2(4)
and the principles of jus ad bellum to apply,

the responsible party must be identified as a
state.54 As noted above, without reliable attribution states generally must respond to cyber
operations as a law enforcement problem. Yet
each of the prevailing frameworks, including the Schmitt Analysis, treats attribution
as a condition precedent to any use-of-force
analysis.55 In other words, without attribution,
a Schmitt Analysis offers limited practical
value. But if state attribution can be established, it is questionable whether a Schmitt
Analysis would be necessary because more
revealing indicators should be discernable,
such as motive and intent.
Next, to the extent state attribution
bears on the characterization of cyber
operations, so too should the victim state’s
response. As the International Court of Justice
noted in Nicaragua: “it is the State which is
the victim of an armed attack which must
form and declare the view that it has been so

attacked.”56 Although Iran has acknowledged
the presence of Stuxnet in its systems, it
has denied any significant damage and has
never claimed that it was subject to an armed
attack. As U.S. Cyber Command’s top lawyer,
Colonel Gary Brown, has commented: “Iran’s
‘non-position’ on the Stuxnet event has been
frustrating to practitioners in the field of
cyberspace operations. Finally, there was a
well-documented, unambiguous cyber attack
to dissect! And yet there was little official
discussion of the issue because Iran passed up
its opportunity to complain of an unjustified
attack.”57 Unfortunately, Professor Schmitt’s
framework does not address the implications
of such state inaction. It remains to be seen
what, if any, impact Iran’s “non-position” has
on the development of use of force norms in
cyberspace.
A more significant observation relates
to Professor Schmitt’s premise that states
will principally rely upon existing norms,
particularly Article 2(4), when making useof-force determinations in cyberspace. As
some commentators predicted—and Stuxnet
demonstrated—Article 2(4) has proven to be a
“weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks.”58
This is due, in part, to the difficulty of observing, measuring, and attributing cyber operations. More importantly, it reflects the fact
that international law is not static and that the
principles of jus ad bellum are not the exclusive province of the UN Charter.59 Whereas
contemporary interpretations of Article 2(4)
reflect the distribution of traditional instruments of power—that is, political, military,
and economic strength—the current array of
cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities does not
mirror the traditional distribution.60 Consequently, states with significant cyber capabilities or vulnerabilities—regardless of their
political, military, or economic strength—are
likely to consider factors well beyond Article
2(4) when characterizing the legality of cyber
operations. Such additional considerations
may include relative cyber strengths and
vulnerabilities; strategic risks and opportunities; scope of potential consequences; ability
to control escalation; effectiveness of cyber
deterrence; potential reactions by adversaries, allies, and international organizations;
domestic politics; state declaratory policies;
emerging state practice (including state inaction); attribution problems; and other legal,
political, and technical constraints.61 Moreover, given the novelty of cyberspace, different

ndupres s . ndu. edu

FOLTZ
states will likely weigh their strategic risks and
opportunities very differently.
Perhaps these additional considerations
explain why there has been so little academic
debate about the legal implications of Stuxnet.
Even though most states would probably
agree that Stuxnet constituted a use of force
under Article 2(4), they may be reluctant to
characterize the attack as unlawful since, by
targeting an illicit program in a pariah state,
it was justifiable. In this regard, it is worth
noting that Stuxnet’s objective was consistent
with multiple UN Security Council mandates

dominate the analysis.63 In light of recent
events in Estonia, Georgia, and Iran, it
appears that time has come.
The Schmitt Analysis of Stuxnet also
has implications for the broader debate over
the use of force in cyberspace. For one thing,
the lack of discussion over the legal implications of Stuxnet demonstrates that states are
unlikely to reach consensus on what constitutes a cyber use of force any time soon. The
lack of a discernable threshold also suggests
that state-sponsored gray area cyber attacks
are more likely.64 Consequently, policymak-

policymakers and cyber practitioners must be prepared to
operate in an ambiguous and contested legal environment
and it promoted those mandates without
resorting to armed force. Thus, it remains
to be seen whether Stuxnet represents a new
form of tacitly condoned cyber vigilante-ism,
or whether the perpetrator(s) will eventually
be held in contempt. Either way, Iran’s “nonposition” has made it easy for the international community to sidestep the issue.

Conclusion
Although Professor Schmitt’s analytic
approach to characterizing cyber operations
remains sound, the analysis of Stuxnet reveals
several shortcomings with his model. These
include severity of the consequences as a
potentially determinative factor, attribution
as a condition precedent to a use of force
analysis, and failure to account for a victim
state’s “non-position” toward a particular
cyber operation. This analysis also reveals
at least one additional factor states may
consider when characterizing cyber operations—whether an attack appears to comply
with LOAC.
More importantly, this analysis suggests
the time has come to relax the model’s strict
adherence to the Article 2(4) instrumentbased paradigm. By tying his framework to
Article 2(4), Professor Schmitt anticipated
more consistent, predictable, and relatively
objective characterizations of force in cyberspace. However, state practice over the last
decade suggests that states will treat Article
2(4) as just one of several factors to consider
when characterizing cyber operations.62 As
Professor Schmitt himself acknowledged, as
state practice emerges, other considerations
and normative approaches—such as greater
emphasis on consequences—may come to
n d u p res s .ndu.edu

ers and cyber practitioners and their legal
advisors must be prepared to operate in an
ambiguous and contested legal environment,
while at the same time shaping new norms
of acceptable state conduct.65 In the end,
these evolving norms are not likely to be constrained by Article 2(4)’s narrow prohibition
on the use of force. Rather, they will likely
reflect the new realities and unique features
of cyberspace, such as cyber’s potentially
devastating consequences, the nontraditional
distribution of cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities, and the international community’s
response (or lack thereof) to seminal events
like Stuxnet. JFQ

As one commentator has noted, “Although
the application of the UN Charter Article 2(4) to
CNA [computer network attack] is an intellectually interesting question, there is reason to wonder
whether, as a practical matter, the issue ever will
arise in a context requiring an actual decision. The
most important obstacle may be the difficulty of
attributing CNA to State action. Moreover, even
if State use of CNA were to emerge as a recognizable phenomenon, such CNA would have to occur
in relative isolation in order squarely to pose the
relevant legal issue. Because this seems improbable,
it likely will be a long time, if ever, before the practice of States, decisions of the International Court
of justice (ICJ), or other recognized sources of
international law yield a clarification of how Article
2(4) applies to CNA.” Daniel B. Silver, “Computer
Network Attack as a Use of Force under Article

Latin for “right to the war,” more commonly
understood as the “right to wage war.” The principles of jus ad bellum are distinct from the related
principles of jus in bello—or the Law of Armed
Conflict (LOAC)—which govern how armed conflict is conducted.

For example, compare Article 39’s “breach of
the peace” and “aggression” thresholds; Article 41’s
“measures short of armed force” standard; Article
42’s “such action by air, sea, or land forces as may
be necessary” language; and Article 51’s “armed
attack” threshold for self-defense actions.

Ibid.,” 905–907. Opinio juris means a sense of
legal obligation. In the international law context, it
is used to judge whether State practice and adherence to norms is due to a sense of legal obligation,
vice political expediency, or convenience. Duhaime.
org Legal Dictionary, available at <www.duhaime.
org/ LegalDictionary/O/OpinioJuris.aspx>. When
opinio juris exists and is consistent with nearly all
state practice, customary international law emerges.
For example, Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice accepts “international custom” as a source of law, but only where
this custom is: (1) “evidence of a general practice,”
and (2) “accepted as law.”

Schmitt, interview by the author. In this

caused by adversaries. See also Schmitt, “Cyber

Professor Schmitt’s responsibility factor is
best understood as a measure of the degree of state
attribution, although he did not describe it as such.
State attribution is an important part of his model
because Article 2(4) and customary international
laws only govern the use of force between states.

As representatives from NATO’s Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE)
have noted: “it is the general murkiness, the lack
of clear policies and procedures, the lack of direct
evidence of the attacking entity’s identity that may
make such attacks even more attractive. In such
a volatile environment, by deliberately remaining
below the threshold of use of force and at the same
time using national policy cover as shield against
investigations and prosecution, an attacking entity
may believe there is less likelihood of reprisal even
if the attacker’s identity is suspected.” CCDCOE,
