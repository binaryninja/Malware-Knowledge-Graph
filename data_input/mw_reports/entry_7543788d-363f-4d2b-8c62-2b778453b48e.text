Russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic
National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition research on
GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to committee officials and
security experts who responded to the breach.
The intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNC’s system that they also were able to
read all email and chat traffic, said DNC officials and the security experts.
The intrusion into the DNC was one of several targeting American political
organizations. The networks of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump were also targeted by Russian spies, as were the computers of some Republican
political action committees, U.S. officials said. But details on those cases were not
available.

“I completely rule out a possibility that the [Russian] government or the government
bodies have been involved in this,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told the
Reuters news agency in Moscow.

The Republican candidate continues to dominate the presidential contest.

Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were
expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign, the committee
officials and experts said.
The DNC said that no financial, donor or personal information appears to have been
accessed or taken, suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage, not the work of
criminal hackers.
The intrusions are an example of Russia’s interest in the U.S. political system and its
desire to understand the policies, strengths and weaknesses of a potential future
president — much as American spies gather similar information on foreign candidates
and leaders.

The depth of the penetration reflects the skill and determination of the United States’
top cyber-adversary as Russia goes after strategic targets, from the White House and
State Department to political campaign organizations.

“It’s the job of every foreign intelligence service to collect intelligence against their
adversaries,” said Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike, the cyber firm called in to
handle the DNC breach and a former head of the FBI’s cyber division. He noted that it is
extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and
determined state such as Russia.

“We’re perceived as an adversary of Russia,” he said. “Their job when they wake up
every day is to gather intelligence against the policies, practices and strategies of the
U.S. government. There are a variety of ways. [Hacking] is one of the more valuable
because it gives you a treasure trove of information.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken favorably about Trump, who has called for
better relations with Russia and expressed skepticism about NATO. But unlike Clinton,
whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights, Trump has not been a
politician for very long, so foreign agencies are playing catch-up, analysts say.
“The purpose of such intelligence gathering is to understand the target’s proclivities,”
said Robert Deitz, former senior councillor to the CIA director and
a former general counsel at

the National Security Agency. “Trump’s foreign investments, for example, would be
relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those
investments” should he be elected, Deitz said. “They may provide tips for understanding
his style of negotiating. In short, this sort of intelligence could be used by Russia, for
example, to indicate where it can get away with foreign adventurism.”

Other analysts noted that any dirt dug up in opposition research is likely to be made
public anyway. Nonetheless, DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusion’s
discovery to contain the damage.
“The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the
campaigns and state parties we work with,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.),
the DNC chairwoman. “When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the
serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately. Our team moved as
quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.”
[Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Worst Week in Washington ]
Clinton called the intrusion “troubling” in an interview with Telemundo. She also said,
“So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into,” and added that
cybersecurity is an issue that she “will be absolutely focused on” if she becomes
president. “Because whether it’s Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more
countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage,” she
said.
A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred questions to the Secret Service.
DNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April. Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call
from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed
some unusual network activity.

“It’s never a call any executive wants to get, but the IT team knew something was awry,”
Dacey said. And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to
investigate.
That evening, she spoke with Michael Sussmann, a DNC lawyer who is a partner with
Perkins Coie in Washington. Soon after, Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor who
handled computer crime cases, called Henry, whom he has known for many years.
Within 24 hours, CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it
could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how.

The firm identified two separate hacker groups, both working for the Russian
government, that had infiltrated the network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike cofounder and chief technology officer. The firm had analyzed other breaches by both
groups over the past two years.

One group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear, had gained access last summer
and was monitoring the DNC’s email and chat communications, Alperovitch said.
The other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the network in late April
and targeted the opposition research files. It was this breach that set off the alarm. The
hackers stole two files, Henry said. And they had access to the computers of the entire
research staff — an average of about several dozen on any given day.
The computers contained research going back years on Trump. “It’s a huge job” to dig
into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before, Dacey said.
CrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in. The firm suspects they may have
targeted DNC employees with “spearphishing” emails. These are communications that
appear legitimate — often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone

trusted — but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious
software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer. “But we don’t have hard
evidence,” Alperovitch said.
The two groups did not appear to be working together, Alperovitch said. Fancy Bear is
believed to work for the GRU, or Russia’s military intelligence service, he said.
CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal
Security Service, or FSB, the country’s powerful security agency, which was once headed
by Putin.

The lack of coordination is not unusual, he said. “There’s an amazing adversarial
relationship” among the Russian intelligence agencies, Alperovitch said. “We have seen
them steal assets from one another, refuse to collaborate. They’re all vying for power, to
sell Putin on how good they are.”

The two crews have “superb operational tradecraft,” he said. They often use previously
unknown software bugs — known as “zero-day” vulnerabilities — to compromise
applications. In the DNC’s case, the hackers constantly switched tactics to maintain a
stealthy presence inside the network and used built-in Windows tools so that they didn’t
have to resort to malicious code that might trigger alerts. “They flew under the radar,”
Alperovitch said.
The two groups have hacked government agencies, tech companies, defense contractors,
energy and manufacturing firms, and universities in the United States, Canada and
Europe as well as in Asia, he said.
Cozy Bear, for instance, compromised the unclassified email systems of the White
House, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014, Alperovitch said.
“This is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time, a lot of resources,

and is interested in targeting the U.S. political system,” Henry said. He said the DNC
was not engaged in a fair fight. “You’ve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-tohand combat with trained military officers,” he said. “And that’s an untenable situation.”
Russia has always been a formidable foe in cyberspace, but in the past two years,
“there’s been a thousand-fold increase in its espionage campaign against the West,” said
Alperovitch, who is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “They feel under siege.”

Western sanctions, imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, have hurt
the economy and led the government to increase its theft of intellectual property to limit
the impact of import restrictions, he said. And Russia’s growing isolation has increased
the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other
countries, he added.
CrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation, said Sussmann, the DNC lawyer.
“But at this time, it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee, donor
or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers,” he said.

The firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to
detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again. “When they get kicked out
of the system,” Henry predicted, “they’re going to try to come back in.”
