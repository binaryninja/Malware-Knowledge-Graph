Spear phishing email is a major worry to any organization. Messages that appear legitimate
and specific fool us more often than random phishing attempts. Exploits that use patched
vulnerabilities delivered via spear phishing email are one of the most successful
combinations used by attackers to infiltrate targeted organizations and gain access to
confidential information.
During the last month, McAfee Labs researchers have uncovered targeted attacks carried
out via spear phishing email against a French company. We have seen email sent to a large
group of individuals in the organization. The attachments exploit the recently patched RTF
vulnerability CVE-2014-1761 and the previously patched ActiveX control vulnerability CVE2012-0158. Both of these vulnerabilities have been popular in several ongoing targeted
attacks.

\
The preceding spear
phishing emails come
from attackers using the
French Yahoo and
Laposte email services
and possibly
impersonating
employees of the
targeted organization.

RTF Vulnerability
These exploits target the recently discovered RTF zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-1761.
The flaw lies in the value of the “ListOverrideCount,” which is set to 25.
However,
according to
Microsoft’s RTF
specifications
this value
should be
either 1 or 9. This error eventually causes an out-of-bounds array overwrite that results in
incorrect handling of the structure by Word and leads to the attacker’s controlling an
extended instruction pointer (EIP).

Shellcode
McAfee Labs researchers discovered that all the bytes of the shellcode, the return oriented
programming (ROP) chain, are directly controlled by the attacker and come straight from the
RTF structure. Here is a high-level view of how the ROP chain is formed:
Next we see a
snapshot of the
parsed RTF
structure in
memory leading to
the control of the
EIP:
Successful
execution of the
shellcode opens
the decoy
document and
drops the malware
svohost.exein the

%TEMP%directoryandthen connects to the control server.
(McAfee Labs researchers Haifei Li and Xie Jun have already blogged on the technical
details of the vulnerability and the shellcode.)
In this cycle of spear phishing attacks we’ve also seen email targeting the same organization
with attachments that exploit the two-year-old CVE -2012-0158 vulnerability. The malicious
payload arrives in the innocuous-sounding article.doc.

The following API trace gives an
idea of the sequence of activities
once the exploit is launched on the
system:
Payload Analysis
Our analysis of the dropped binary
reveals that it was specifically
written to
gather
information
about the
network of
the target
organization
as well as
the
configuration
of the
endpoint—
leading us to
believe that
this is a
spear
phishing

reconnaissance. The payload seems to have been compiled on April 9:
The malware starts by retrieving the %Temp% path and prepares to log the communication
with its control server in the file %Temp%explorer.exe.
Subsequently, the malware collecting following information:
Hostname
Username
System type by resolving IsWOW64Process AP

Current TCP and UDP
connections and open ports
Organizational
information from the
registry key:

HKLM/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion,

CSDVersion,

Current running system services
Installed software from the registry key:
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall
Information about network adapters, IP configuration, netcard numbers, IP mask,
gateway, DHCP server, DHCP host, WINS server, and WINS host
Here is a high-level snapshot of the malware’s information gathering code:

Encryption is primarily done using the SYSTEMTIME structure. It forms the repetitive 256byte key using SYSTEMTIME information, shown below:
The
malware
converts
the key
into 16
bytes to

encrypt the information.

Once the buffer has been encrypted, it connects to the control server
sophos.skypetm.com.tw.

Command and Control Research
During our analysis of this exploit, sophos.skypetm.com.tw resolved to the IP address
66.220.4.100. located in the Fremont, California. McAfee sensors first observed the
outbound traffic to this domain on January 27, at which time it resolved to 198.100.113.27,
located in Los Angeles.
From our passive DNS data, we found following MD5 hashes connecting to the same
domain resolving to 198.100.113.27.

The whois record reveals that the skypetm.com.tw domain has been registered under the
email ID longsa33@yahoo.com. This ID also registered the domain avstore.com.tw, which
has been used as the control server.
We
have
seen

several other malware binaries communicating with the various subdomains of
skypetm.com.tw and avstore.com.tw. All of them have been identified as “PittyTiger”
malware, which appears in numerous CVE-2012-0158 exploits used in recent targeted
attacks. The same payload was used in the “Tomato Garden” APT campaign, uncovered in
June 2013, against Tibetan and Chinese democracy activists.
