Foreword
One year ago, Russia invaded Ukraine.
Since then, tens of thousands of people
have been killed, millions of Ukrainians
have fled and the country has sustained
tens of billions of dollars worth of damage.
Importantly, this marks the first time
that cyber operations have played such
a prominent role in a world conflict.

for 2023:

This includes a significant shift in various groups’ focus towards
Ukraine, a dramatic increase in the use of destructive attacks on
Ukrainian government, military and civilian infrastructure, a spike
in spear-phishing activity targeting NATO countries, and an uptick
in cyber operations designed to further multiple Russian objectives.
For example, we’ve observed threat actors hack-and-leak sensitive
information to further a specific narrative.
Second, Moscow has leveraged the full spectrum of information
operations — from overt state-backed media to covert platforms
and accounts — to shape public perception of the war.
These operations have three goals: (1) undermine the Ukrainian government; (2) fracture international support for Ukraine; and (3) maintain
domestic support in Russia for the war. We’ve seen spikes of activity
associated with key events in the conflict such as the buildup, invasion,
and troop mobilization in Russia. At Google, we’ve worked aggressively
across products, teams, and regions to counter these activities where
they violate our policies and disrupt overt and covert information
operations campaigns, but continue to encounter relentless attempts
to circumvent our policies.
Finally, the invasion has triggered a notable shift in the Eastern
European cybercriminal ecosystem that will likely have long term
implications for both coordination between criminal groups and
the scale of cybercrime worldwide.
Some groups, for example, have split over political allegiances and
geopolitics, while others have lost prominent operators. This will impact
the way we think about these groups and our traditional understanding
of their capabilities. We’ve also seen a trend towards specialization in

We assess with high confidence that Russian government-backed
attackers will continue to conduct cyber attacks against Ukraine
and NATO partners to further Russian strategic objectives.
We assess with high confidence that Moscow will increase
disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments
on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance — real
or perceived — towards Ukraine (e.g., troop losses, new foreign
commitments to provide political or military support, etc.). These
attacks will primarily target Ukraine but increasingly expand to
include NATO partners.
We assess with moderate confidence that Russia will continue
to increase the pace and scope of information operations to
achieve the objectives described above, particularly as we
approach key moments like international funding, military aid,
domestic referendums, and more. What’s less clear is whether
these activities will achieve the desired impact, or simply harden
opposition against Russian aggression over time.

It is clear cyber will now play an integral role in future armed conflict,
supplementing traditional forms of warfare. We hope this report
serves as a call to action as we prepare for potential future conflicts
around the world. At Google, we are committed to doing our part
to support collective defense and look forward to partnering
with others to drive continued progress and help organizations,
businesses, governments, and users stay safe online.

the ransomware ecosystem that blends tactics across actors, making
definitive attribution more difficult. Importantly, the war in Ukraine has
also been defined by what we expected — but didn’t see. For example,
we didn’t observe a surge of attacks against critical infrastructure
outside of Ukraine.

Section 1
Government-backed
attackers
Russia’s cyber preparations began long before the invasion
Russian government-backed attackers ramped up cyber operations beginning
in 2021 during the run up to the invasion. This led to a 250% increase in Russian
phishing campaigns directed against users in Ukraine in 2022 (compared to

a 2020 baseline). We attribute this increase to two primary factors: (1) some
attackers intensified their traditional focus on Ukraine and (2) others shifted their
focus towards Ukraine. To help counter these efforts, we disrupted phishing
campaigns against the Ukrainian government and military organizations,
as well as critical infrastructure, media and the information space.
Users in NATO countries face intensified targeting

through cyberspace. This effort includes a range of campaigns
designed to improve intelligence collection, deploy destructive
attacks against victim networks, and advance active measures
to shape the information environment in Moscow’s favor.

Waves of destructive malware hit Ukraine
Russian Armed Forces’ Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) -sponsored
actors have used destructive malware to disrupt and degrade Ukraine’s government and military capabilities. In parallel, we’ve seen similar attacks on civilian
infrastructure in an attempt to undermine the public’s trust in the government’s
ability to deliver basic services. We observed more destructive cyberattacks

A note on threat actor naming conventions
Our understanding of these groups is based on a
body of technical data that includes infrastructure,
malware, and the broader set of tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) threat actors use in their campaigns. Other analysts may use different methodologies to assess actor activity. There is no single industry standard for naming these actors, but we’ve listed
aliases where our group names align with others.
Attribution to the underlying entity behind the group
often comes later (if at all) from clues in the technical
data and other sources like media and publicly available government documents. It is not uncommon for

multiple actors representing distinct sets of technical
activity to eventually be attributed to the same ultimate organization, similar to the attribution we made
to GRU in this paper (see the threat actor deep dives).
We use the term “government-backed attacker”
instead of the term “advanced persistent threat”
(APT) to more clearly differentiate these groups
from other financially motivated actors discussed
later in the paper.

in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years
with a notable spike in activity at the start of the invasion. In contrast to NotPetya,
we’ve seen little evidence of a spillover effect outside Ukraine.
Russia uses cyber operations for multiple strategic objectives
We’ve observed a notable uptick in the intensity and frequency of Russian cyber
operations designed to maximize access to victim networks, systems, and data
to achieve multiple strategic objectives. For example, GRU-sponsored actors
have used their access to steal sensitive information and release it to the public
to further a narrative, or use that same access to conduct destructive cyber
attacks or information operations campaigns.
In this section, we outline trends in the threat landscape and then dive deeper
into specific Russian government-backed attackers and their behavior in 2022.

One exception was the cyber attack against the Viasat KA-SAT network hours
before the Russian invasion that resulted in a partial interruption of KA-SAT’s
satellite broadband service. The governments of the UK and US attributed the
attack to Russia, in order to ”disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the
invasion.” The incident also impacted tens of thousands of other fixed broadband
customers across Europe, and German energy company Enercon said a “massive
disruption” of satellite connections in Europe affected the operations of 5,800
wind turbines in central Europe.

Section 2
Information Operations

Moscow leverages full spectrum
of information operations to shape
public perception of war
We’ve seen significant changes in the information landscape as Moscow
leverages the full spectrum of information operations — from overt
state-backed media to covert platforms and accounts — to shape public
perception of the war. These operations have three goals: (1) undermine
the Ukrainian government; (2) fracture international support for Ukraine;
and (3) maintain domestic support in Russia for the war. We’ve seen spikes
of activity associated with key events in the conflict such as the buildup,
invasion, and troop mobilization in Russia. At Google, we’ve worked
aggressively across products, teams, and regions to counter these
activities where they violate our policies and disrupt overt and covert
information operations campaigns, but continue to encounter relentless
attempts to circumvent our detection and enforcement.

Russian IO focused on domestic audiences
The covert Russian IO we’ve disrupted on Google product surfaces primarily
focused on maintaining Russian domestic support for the war in Ukraine,
with spikes of IO activity occurring during the initial buildup, invasion, and
the troop mobilization in Russia.
IO actors using overt and covert methods
Covert messaging and disinformation surrounding Ukraine and the Russian
invasion continues to be spread by groups mimicking authentic users and
by self-described news entities that covertly tie back to Russian intelligence.
Google has disrupted overt and covert IO campaigns on Google product
surfaces, while Mandiant observed notable degrees of covert activity on
various social media platforms such as Telegram.
Resurgence of hacktivism
The range of actors involved in covert campaigns spans government-backed
actors discussed earlier, dedicated IO actors, and ideologically-motivated
hacktivists. The war has triggered an increase in declared hacktivist activity
and a rise in the use of hacktivist tactics, bringing a renewed and sustained
prominence to such activity.
Russian intelligence connection to hacktivists
Investigation of covert IO activity surrounding the war included the identification
of “hacktivist” groups suspected to be tied to Russian intelligence services,
raising the concern that these and others may be functioning as cutouts,
a longstanding Russian IO tactic. Such activity is one component of a pattern
of concurrent disruptive attacks, espionage, and information operations that
we have observed — likely the first instance of all three being conducted
simultaneously by state actors in a conventional war.

ing their techniques to target Ukraine.
In early 2022, the attackers shifted their focus
to targeting Ukrainian organizations, the Ukrainian
government, and European humanitarian and
non-profit organizations. The group’s targeting
wildly varied from European NGOs to less targeted attacks on Ukrainian government entities,
organizations and individuals. Rather uniquely, the
group demonstrates strong interest in breaching
businesses operating in the hospitality industry
of Ukraine, going as far as launching multiple
distinct campaigns against the same hotel chains.
This overlap of activity is likely to continue
throughout the conflict. As recently as December
2022, the Ukrainian CERT reported that a tool used
by the Cuba ransomware access brokers, dubbed
ROMCOM, was used to target users of the DELTA
military system used by Ukraine’s military.

Conclusion

In this report, we outlined Russia’s
multi-pronged effort to gain a decisive
wartime advantage in cyberspace
and use information operations to help
shape public perception of the war.
We also discussed the war’s impact on criminal groups and the
scale of cybercrime worldwide. Based on these observations,
we point to several broader, forward looking assessments for

At Google, we’ll continue to work

and security of online users and our

We assess with high confidence that Russian government-backed
attackers will continue to conduct cyber attacks against Ukraine

focus on the war.

disruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments
on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance — real
or perceived — towards Ukraine (e.g., troop losses, new foreign
commitments to provide political or military support, etc.). These
attacks will primarily target Ukraine but increasingly expand
to include NATO partners.
We assess with moderate confidence that Russia will continue
to increase the pace and scope of information operations to
achieve the objectives described above, particularly as we
approach key moments like international funding, military aid,
domestic referendums, and more. What’s less clear is whether
these activities will achieve the desired impact, or simply harden
opposition against Russian aggression over time.
