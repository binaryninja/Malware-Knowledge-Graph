Sofacy Phishing

Tactical Intelligence Bulletin – TLP: WHITE
Background
Our analysts follow the activities of a number of threat groups with a wide range of motivations. In this
bulletin we are sharing intelligence relating to a recent phishing campaign conducted by a group widely
referred to as ‘Sofacy’, named after the antivirus1 detection name for one of the malware families used by
the group.
Over the years there have been a number of papers discussing variations to the malware used by the
group, but little discussion of less sophisticated techniques employed by the same attackers.

Analysis
Sofacy has been discussed before as being used to target APEC members 2 and there has also been some
prior analysis of the malware itself3. Variants of the malware have been in use for a considerable amount
of time – for example, the screenshot below is from the decoy document loaded by one of the earliest
versions present on ThreatExpert4, from February 2010.

Sample 5e3bea788e89e0814e898b4a648b93c0b74f7e2c

Decoy documents are used in conjunction with malware droppers in order to make the target believe the
file they have just opened is legitimate. The documents often give an indication of the attackers’ intended
targets.
More recently, ESET have reported5 on related spear phishes using NATO/Ukrainian conflict themes and
watering hole attacks likely targeting the defence industry and a Polish finance company. It has been
publicly speculated before that Sofacy malware is Russian in origin. Indicators found in the malware
analysis referenced in the appendix, such as embedded resources and targeting would appear to support
this theory.

Targeting
Recently, we observed a number of new domain registrations by the Sofacy attackers, all of which are
closely related via shared WHOIS data and infrastructure. New domain registrations are usually
indicative of a new campaign, and so we were eager to find new samples of the malware which connected
to the infrastructure. The domain names chosen were almost identical to the legitimate domains of
several organisations, a common technique and, like carefully chosen decoy documents, often gives clues
as to the likely targets of the campaign. The new domain names mimicked organisations in the following
categories:
•

International and European diplomatic institutions

•

Popular providers of web services

•

Military institutions, contractors and conferences

•

Energy companies

•

News organisations based out of the United States and Central Europe

In addition to new malware samples, we also found examples where the attackers were using the simple
technique of phishing for credentials. The usage of malware in targeted attacks to steal information of
value to attackers has been widely reported, however the simple technique of phishing for credentials,
whilst still relatively common in targeted attacks, is still more typically associated with criminal attackers
involved in day to day cyber-fraud.
The pages used for phishing typically used obfuscated code to redirect the user to another webpage:

In some pages the malicious redirect was disabled by the attackers, by placing additional JavaScript on
the page which would redirect users to a legitimate site preferentially.
Fake login pages were observed both for webmail and two factor-authentication platforms. In the second
case this would require the attackers to log in at the same time as affected victims, showing a level of
dedication to the cause. As well as the domains used being similar to those of the targeted, the pages were
also made to appear the same as their legitimate counterparts, making it difficult for end-users to tell they
were being duped.
For example the screenshot below shows the contents of a credential phishing website designed to mimic
the legitimate OWA site of a defence contractor. The attacker’s version is on the left, the real version is on
the right:

Two of the domains we identified have previously been associated in open source with credential
phishing, although not attributed to this group of attackers:


In October 2013 the domain chmail[.]in was reported 6 as being used in widespread attacks
against users of the Iranian mail service chmail[.]ir



In January 2014 the domain google-settings[.]com was reported7 as being used in credential theft
against some gmail users.

Recommended Actions
As ever with phishing attacks, one of the most important preventative steps you can take is to educate
staff on how to identify suspicious emails – especially as there are fewer technical measures that can be
taken to prevent low distribution phishing attacks which aim to steal credentials than there are for similar
attacks involving malware.
Organisations with good logging for their e-mail data could attempt to detect activity relating to
compromised accounts by alerting on “impossible journeys”, where locations from which users log in are
monitored and where alerts are produced when a single user logs in from two separate countries in a short
period of time.

Snort Signatures
We have developed some SNORT signatures to detect the current template used by the attackers in their
phishing campaigns. The following signatures detect Javascript that is present on many obfuscated
redirects, not necessarily related to this activity but which may be indicative of Sofacy phishing:

The following comment occurs in many of the pages we’ve observed relating to this campaign, but can
also appear in some legitimate sites:
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Potential Sofacy Phishing Redirect";
