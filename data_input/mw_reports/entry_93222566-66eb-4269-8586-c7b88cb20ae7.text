Analysing Remcos RAT’s executable
krabsonsecurity.com/2018/03/02/analysing-remcos-rats-executable/

Posted on March 2, 2018
Remcos is a native RAT sold on the forums HackForums.net. It is an interesting piece of
RAT (and the only one that is developed in a native language other than Netwire) and is
heavily used by malware actors. Coded by the author, Viotto, it is self proclaimed to be a
legal administration tool. Whether that is true or not is to be understood by people who have
seen Remcos malware campaigns and the fact that the author also sells a crypter.
First thing we notice when looking at Remcos RAT is that it uses C++ and the CRT quite
heavily. This leads to the output file being rather large (though still small by some
standards) at 120kb.

Another interesting thing is that Remcos allows you to extract the license (which is most
likely based on the HWID) of the individual who created the stub easily by executing the file
with the -l switch. If the sample is packed by a crypter that does not pass the command line
parameter, you’ll have to unpack it first.

Static Mutex (compared across multiple bins), runtime detection and hooking as well as
memory signature anyone?

Simple resource loading using kernel32 APIs

Fragments from usage of the public password recovery tools developed by NirSoft (/stext is
a command line switch used to dump passwords to a text file, reference):

2/18

Public pasted runpe (almost identical to this, the only difference is that the Unicode API is
used and the input buffer is not freed at the end).

Disabling MSC via registry (I would be surprised if no AVs detect this as suspicious
behaviour)

3/18

Repeatedly loading the same string over and over again using the .c_str() function
(because one cannot store the same static string in a global/local variable and use it for
these calls rather than obtaining it again and again every time)

File installation implementation:

4/18

Starting the debug console

Very simple (and runtime detected) keylogger using SetWindowsHookExA (13 is the
constant for WH_KEYBOARD_LL)

5/18

Downloading file using URLDownloadToFileW and then dropping VBS file to replace old
executable with new executable for updating:

6/18

Resolving some APIs (I am rather curious as to why these specific APIs are resolved
dynamically when other suspicious APIs such as WriteProcessMemory and
SetThreadContext are imported directly from the IAT0.

7/18

Downloading DLL to buffer, map a new memory page and then loading the DLL:

8/18

It also seem that the RAT is somewhat modular, DLLs are sent from the controller (or
loaded from resource/.data) and functions from it are called.

The functions listed here are only found as strings in remcos samples, which confirms that
the module is custom.
Overall, Remcos is not advanced nor extraordinary and a killer for it can be easily be
developed when needed. Despite being rather unsophiscated, it is still heavily used by
cybercriminals to control infected devices and siphone money from those who are infected.

Nice review Mr. Krabs, but being the author of this software, I want to correct some
mistakes you made during your analysis. 1) Regarding the legality question: I don't
know where you live, but here in Europe what I am developing and selling is perfectly
legal. We don't allow malicious usage, and this is why, as yourself stated, the
customer licence is stored in the Remcos agent, and can be easily retrieved using the
-l command. Anytime we get a report of someone abusing our software and not using
it for legal means, we can promptly check and make his copy unusable anytime. We
have a dedicated email just for abuse reports: abuse@breakingsecurity.net 2) You
said: "size is quite large". 120 kb is large for a program which allows total control of
any part of the Windows OS? It is a tiny size expecially for today standards, where
most of the software is bloated. I don't think you'll find other remote control software
with a better size/number of functions ratio. Check TeamViewer, for example, which
has just a fraction of Remcos functions. 3) In the last part you stated: "Remcos is not
advanced and a killer can be easily developed when needed". Then still you forget
that our focus is on legal administration and surveillance, we don't aid cybercriminals
as you state. Actually, what you did is a criminal offence by european laws, which is
called defamation towards a company. If you need any other clarification, we are
always available. :) Best regards, Viotto BreakingSecurity.net administrator and

1) I said "Whether that is true or not is to be understood by people who have
seen Remcos malware campaigns and the fact that the author also sells a
crypter." for a reason. Quite a lot of malware campaigns that used Remcos so
far (statistics easily obtainable from honeypots and malware databases),
wouldn't you agree? 2) Well maybe you shouldn't claim that it is 90kb or 100kb
on your sites then because I saw that thus me making the comment 3) Maybe
you should work better on preventing abuse then because malware campaigns
which relies on Remcos is not uncommon at all, further more you are selling a
crypter yourself so please don't try to look innocent. :) 4) Well excuse me, I don't
know on what other forums do you advertise your product but HF is definitely
one of them

1) Yes, it happened that Remcos has been used in malware campaigns,
and anytime we got a report, we banned licence and immediately stopped
the whole campaign. Also guns get used for a lot of bad things, but if a
manufacturer produces a gun which works well, it is not his fault if it is
used in a robbery, isn't it? :) As gun manufacturers do, we do also print a
serial code on each one of the licenced software. We have got the majority
of customers who use our software respecting our contract and terms, is it
so strange? The majority of these attacks have been done using the
cracked version of our tool, so we have been a victim of it as well in those
cases. 2) The normal Remcos stub (if disabling compression), in v2.0.2 is
108kb. You analysed the relocation stub which is 120kb more. In the Free
version, size is even smaller, around 70 kb. So, in the site I wrote: around
100 kb, because it depends on settings such as stub type and
compression. In no case goes bigger then 120kb, which as you know is a
tiny size even for floppy disks standards. 3) Yes, and as Remcos, Octopus
Protector can be used for many different purposes. Same terms of
services applies to that. I think we did all possible measures to prevent
abuse, but if you have got some extra idea, I will hear ;) 4) We don't sell on
HackForums, that is just one of the places where we do advertise this
product. We do sell just on our own site. Then mostly we do cooperate with
companies which don't use forums. Best regards, Viotto

1: Why would a valid license be used in correlation with a distribution
campaign? Judging from your need of an invite code, you would be
expected to personally filter out any suspicious customers (assuming
the invite request is for customer validation). 2(referring to your point
3): Sales of such tools (Octopus Protector) wouldn't be so
aggravating if the toys associated with the tool wasn't so blatantly
forged. Crypters always have, and always will be used for illicit
purposes only; a legitimate network owner would never require such
a tool to bypass any third party protection under his/her own
command. If you wish to defend this claim with something along the
lines of "this tool is not for protection of malware, rather protection of
legitimate executables," then why has your official channel uploaded
a blatant AV bypass video?(https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=BVxQxSfNJXQ) Something a legitimate developer would never
need. Also referring to a line in your description: "An executable file
gets totally encrypted and protected from human and antivirus
analysis." preventing a human from tampering I would understand,
but why would a legitimate executable require protection from any
form of AV analysis procedures? Overall your attempt to claim your
malware legal, was extremely cringe. Anyone who sells a R.A.T
alongside a crypter, is clearly in it for blackhat money.

Hello mr Avira, late reply from me here but I just noticed your comment. Regarding
your points: 1: Yes, our customers can purchase just if registered (and registration
requires an invite code), so we do filter out suspicious customers, or ban them if we
notice malicious activity after they purchased. Many attacks have been carried out
using an old, cracked Remcos version, the cracker removed abuse protection so
unfortunately this wasn't under our control. We have been damaged by this as well,
since malicious users abused our software. 2: Crypters have many uses, such as
protecting files from analysis and cracking. Since I own a cybersecurity company
which involves hacking as well (in an ethical way), my Octopus Protector can be used
against many kinds of analysis, including AV analysis. This is however not illegal,
unless you are using it against unaware users. The video is a demonstration that even
stronger AV protections can be bypassed. If your point was true, then even Metasploit
would be illegal, but it isn't. Best regards, Viotto

Viotto, 1. You clearly say that "Also guns get used for a lot of bad things, but if a
manufacturer produces a gun which works well, it is not his fault if it is used in a
robbery, isn’t it?" In software, you have a lot more control over your customers,
guns are a physical piece of metal, which makes your argument invalid. In
software, you can place for example, an alert to the person launching the file on
another computer that they are executing a file that can take control of your
computer? Also you state "Yes, it happened that Remcos has been used in
malware campaigns, and anytime we got a report, we banned licence and
immediately stopped the whole campaign." Instead of only getting reports from a
third party, why aren't you taking any action yourself cracking on the
suspicious/malicious users? I clearly gave you an idea how to crack down on
ANY malicious campaign, but obviously you are not going to invent this,
because all your customers are using the product in a malicious manner, thus
you don't want to take any action against it other than the bad reports. 2. You
state "my Octopus Protector can be used against many kinds of analysis,
including AV analysis" Why does your product need to make the files "crypted"
in the crypter, undetected from anti-viruses? Only thing they do is analyze the
file, see if it can be used maliciously, if yes, they detect the file. Every update of
your product makes the stub undetected, which isn't required in order to control
another persons computer, since the anti-viruses can be disabled manually on
the "targets" PC. You made a video of an anti-viruses scanning your file after
you put it thru your "crypter". Why is this relevant? Why aren't any other native
packers making their programs undetected from anti-viruses if they are not used
in a malicious manner?

Why would any security product need to be bypassed in a controlled
environtment? Your "my Octopus Protector can be used against many kinds of
analysis, including AV analysis" could be argued against with something such
as: Why would you need to protect your customer's file from a legitimate
researcher? No one employed by a security company would wish to distribute
your file; they are checking whether it is a potential threat to their customer
base. If you really wished to portay a legitimate image, you could follow in the
footsteps of LuminosityLink by forcing a pre-installation watermark. Functions
such as: RunPE & "ReplacePE" play a major role in most modern malware
campaigns. How would these methods aid in preventing analysis of a
legimitmate file? Forgive the 8 day delay, and don't see this reply as a form of
attack. I am merely trying to get your side of things

"Only thing they do is analyze the file, see if it can be used maliciously, if yes, they
detect the file." Really? Are we all to believe that? Unfortunately I disagree, because
the AV industry has for a very very long time not done its homework regarding false
positives. Some of the assumptions made in AV heuristics are equally cringeworthy as
the apologetic tone of Viotto above. Nice wording, by the way. Something "can be
used maliciously" and AV vendors "detect the file". Sounds easy. But there isn't even
an industry-wide standard on what that first term means, let alone a standard on how
things get detected. Serious AV testing is just in its infancy, despite AV testers having
been around for quite some time. Oh, and a lot of things “can be used maliciously”,
but kitchen knives are still sold, despite having been used in murders (the same thing
goes for a lot of blunt tools from any workshop). Of course that’s the very reason you
decided to use "can be used malicously" as opposed to "is malicious". Because the
world is not black and white and you know it. But when it comes to false positives no
one cares and the world is black and white after all. Sure, detecting a RAT, even as
PUA, is perfectly (!) fine. But AV vendors' analysis capacities have long been been
overwhelmed. Which leads to copying of detections [1] within the industry, which is not
only evidenced by that infamous Kaspersky experiment a few years ago. But once
propagated throughout the industry, these detections rarely get corrected even if they
turn out to be false positives. Detections propagate, their removal in case of false
positives does not. That's a real problem. Both for small independent software
creators and their customers. Even though the original AV vendor, detecting an item
first, may correct the mistake, it takes considerable effort to remove such a detection
from all those dozens different AV products. And - as I pointed out - detections (all
types!) in the AV industry propagate. Now, while sample sharing is a good thing,
copying detections is not. There is a disparity between how easy it is for an AV to
detect a given executable file as malicious (and no, most users won't even bother
reading the fineprint, so: detected by AV == malicious) and for that detection to spread
throughout the industry and how effing hard it is to ever get a wrongful detection
(which often borders on the commercial equivalent of character assassination, given
that smaller companies are already disadvantaged as it is) out again. While in order to
end up in detection of just about every AV product out there all you need to do is that
you use some allegedly "shady APIs" or end up with some bored AV analyst looking at
your file and making the wrong decision within the short allotted time (assuming it's
not some inherently stupid sandbox with some heuristics created by equally bored
analysts mounted on top: AI ... automated imbecility), in order to get out again you'd
have to contact every single effing AV vendor individually and then it typically takes a
long time to receive a response, if any. Let alone the time it takes to get the detection
removed - if one manages it at all - or to "argue" one's case. This is an uphill battle for
any legitimate software vendor having his product(s) end up in detection. And no AV
vendor or the industry overall sees that as a problem. Because they act like a sheriff in
the wild west, embodying the law (or so they think) and therefore what they do must

17/18

be The Right Thing™. Even if it effectively amounts to slander and the commercial
equivalent of character assassination. Seriously, if AV vendors are the good guys,
then why the heck can't they even play by commonly accepted rules or by time-proven
paradigms such as "in dubio pro reo"? Now what the makers of Remcos RAT do is
shady. No doubt about it. And selling the crypter alongside the RAT doesn't make it
look any better. But PLEASE take off your rose-colored glasses, AV people! Small
independent software vendors have no legal department. Heck, open source
developers don't even have a sales or marketing department. Being detected by an
AV is the death knell to many small software creators and is very demotivating indeed
for open source developers. Don't take adding something INTO detection so lightly,
would ya? And get your act together to provide one single contact to report false
positives instead of having small ISVs running the gauntlet with understaffed "support
departments" trying to shield actual analysts from seeing false positive reports. [1]
And by copying I am not implying that this is done verbatim or so. Alone the difference
in how the various engines work would make that hard. However, the fact that files are
shared between AV vendors and that VirusTotal also shares files with the vendors
leads to the observation that one of the heuristics of whether a file ought to end up in
detection is apparently a.) the trust vendor A places in vendor X detecting that file
already and/or b.) a threshold value of how many AV vendors already have said file in
detection, leading to a vendor also detecting it. Now you should be able to see the
vicious circle this creates, not to mention the issue that the turnaround for detections
being copied is relatively fast, whereas alone the attempt by a smaller independent
software developer to have a detection of his/her software removed takes AGES in
comparison. Not to mention that you need to contact each and every AV vendor
individually. Great stuff!

Nice website. I especially like your Revcode posts.
5. hwac121Posted on 8:01 pm June 10, 2019
Who the hell wants to purchase a software that has a backdoor built-in purposely by
the developer so they can deactivate your software whenever they like? As for the
author of this article...ALL hacking tools are used by both white hat and black hat...the
only way to be a good white hat hacker and security professional is to understand and
be able to use the exact same tools the criminals do.
