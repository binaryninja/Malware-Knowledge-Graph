ITG18: Operational Security Errors Continue to Plague Sizable Iranian Threat Group

This blog supplements a Black Hat USA 2021 talk given August 2021.
IBM Security X-Force threat intelligence researchers continue to track the infrastructure and activity of
a suspected Iranian threat group ITG18. This group’s tactics, techniques and procedures(TTPs)
overlap with groups known as Charming Kitten, Phosphorus and TA453.
Since our initial report on the group’s training videos in May 2020, X-Force has uncovered additional
operational security errors by this group. Our continued analysis led to the discovery of a malicious tool
that has not been previously linked to this threat actor, a custom Android backdoor we named
“LittleLooter.” LittleLooter has only been observed being used by ITG18. X-Force is not aware of other
threat actors leveraging this backdoor.
Additionally, from August 2020 through May 2021, X-Force observed ITG18 successfully compromise
multiple victims aligned with the Iranian reformist movement. Given the timing and focus of the activity,
this may have been in support of surveillance objectives leaving up to the June 2021 presidential
elections in Iran. Finally, despite continued OPSEC errors, ITG18 appears to conduct a sizeable and
often successful operation that heavily focuses on compromising personal webmail and social media
accounts.

LittleLooter, ITG18’s Android Surveillance Tool
X-Force researchers discovered a file named “WhatsApp.apk” (md5:
a04c2c3388da643ef67504ef8c6907fb) on infrastructure associated with ITG18 operations.

Upon further analysis, X-Force determined “WhatsApp.apk” was Android malware that we named
“LittleLooter” based on its information stealing capabilities.
For C2 communication, LittleLooter attempts to establish communication to the C2 server via HTTP
POST requests and responses. The C2 server masquerades as an American flower shop and has
been active since July 2020. The communication between the malware and the C2 server is
compressed via GZIP, AES encrypted and BASE64 encoded. The AES key and initialization vector
(IV) are hardcoded into the sample:

LittleLooter is functionally rich, providing ITG18 operators the following capabilities on an infected

The LittleLooter sample X-Force analyzed had the version number “5”, as well as an update capability
if LittleLooter detected it was running a previous version. The tool updates itself by downloading a zip
file from a URL on the C2 server: “http[:]//[C2server]/updates/update_[class name].zip” and replacing
the old “classes.dex” file with the newer version from the zip file. Finally, LittleLooter is a modified
version of Android malware reported by third party researchers several years ago and has likely been
in use by ITG18 for years prior to our association with this threat group.

New Targeting Supports Possible Surveillance Objectives
In addition to the discovery of LittleLooter, X-Force researchers discovered ITG18 targeted Iranian
individuals from late summer 2020 through spring 2021, which supports ITG18’s long-standing
operations against Iranian citizens of interest. X-Force has found that despite public reporting of their

OPSEC mistakes, ITG18 continues to leave archive files containing exfiltrated victim information on
open servers and in open directories. The new analysis by X-Force revealed ITG18 exfiltrated roughly
120 gigabytes of information from approximately 20 individuals aligned with the Reformist movement in
Iran.
Similar to exfiltrated information X-Force observed ITG18 steal last summer, this new stolen data was
frequently extracted using legitimate utilities associated with the compromised accounts. Most recently,
those were Telegram accounts, one of the most popular instant messaging services used in Iran.
Telegram is one of the only foreign social media services permitted for use in Iran and was heavily
used during the 2009 Green Movement to organize protests. X-Force researchers believe the victims’
Telegram data was possibly targeted during the summer 2020 through spring-2021 time frame to
support monitoring any dissent or protests around Iran’s 2021 June Presidential Election.
While X-Force did not observe how initial access to the accounts was gained, ITG18 could have
leveraged LittleLooter’s capabilities or used phishing/social engineering to gather account credentials
from their targets.

Based on the exfiltrated information X-Force observed, most of the victims were associated with Iran’s
Reformist movement, a political faction within Iran that supports more leftist policies versus the current,
conservative regime. The stolen data contained photos associated with the victim, contact lists, group
memberships and conversations.

A Sizable Operation Marches On
The information X-Force has gleaned on ITG18’s activity, in conjunction with the training videos XForce found in the summer of 2020, continues to paint a picture of a threat actor that likely leverages a
considerable number of personnel. This is underpinned by how manual and labor-intensive ITG18
operations appear to be, from gaining initial access to individual victim accounts to carefully reviewing
exfiltrated data.
Several open-source reports have noted how ITG18 operators, beyond simply sending phishing
messages, will also attempt to chat, call, and even video conference with targets. This personalized
attention to each compromised individual likely requires hands-on work from a large number of
operators. While X-Force cannot confirm how many individuals and organizations ITG18 has targeted
recently, what has been observed so far in 2021 is identification of over 60 servers hosting more than
100 phishing domains, which suggests there may be a large number of victims.

X-Force has also observed how manual ITG18 operations can be when reviewing exfiltrated
information. Through some of the videos that X-Force discovered last summer, an ITG18 operator was
observed spending hours in manual work. They were seen validating credentials by copying and
pasting stolen victim usernames and passwords into a wide variety of websites, for just two victims. XForce alone has observed almost 2 terabytes of compressed exfiltrated data on publicly accessible
ITG18 servers since 2018. This likely represents only a small portion of the data actually stolen by this
adversary. Coupled with the training videos X-Force discovered, suggesting ITG18 has enough
turnover or growth to warrant training, this likely indicates ITG18 requires a significant number of
personnel for operations, as well as for processing and evaluating exfiltrated information.

Anticipate Activity for the Foreseeable Future
ITG18 operations persist despite numerous public disclosures of their insecure activity and stolen data,
speaking to the ability of this group to continue on its mission. X-Force researchers have high
confidence that ITG18 activity will continue regardless of public reporting due to their broad objectives
and continued success of their operations. We recommend reviewing the indicators below to identify
potential malicious activity on your networks and on mobile devices.
