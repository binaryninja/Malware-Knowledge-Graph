CTA-2018-0816

Scope Note: Recorded Future analyzed new malware targeting the Tibetan community, resulting
in a detailed analysis of the malware and its associated infrastructure. Sources include Recorded
Future’s platform, VirusTotal, ReversingLabs, and third-party metadata, as well as common
OSINT and network metadata enrichments, such as DomainTools IRIS and PassiveTotal. This
research is part of a series highlighting the breadth of sophisticated techniques used by the
Chinese state against perceived domestic threats.

Executive Summary
Following our research uncovering the Chinese RedAlpha campaigns targeting the Tibetan
community, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identiﬁed a novel Linux backdoor called “ext4,”
deployed against the same Tibetan victim group. By analyzing the backdoor, we uncovered
repeated attempted connections to the same compromised CentOS web server emanating
from infrastructure registered to Tsinghua1 University, an elite Chinese academic
institution.
We also identiﬁed network reconnaissance activities being conducted from the same
Tsinghua University infrastructure targeting many geopolitical organizations, including the
State of Alaska Government, Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources, the United Nations
oﬃce in Nairobi, and the Kenya Ports Authority. Additionally, we identiﬁed the targeted
scanning of German automotive multinational Daimler AG that began a day after it cut its
proﬁt outlook for the year, citing the growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. In
several cases, these activities occurred during periods of Chinese dialogue for economic
cooperation with these countries or organizations.
We assess with medium conﬁdence that the network reconnaissance activities we
uncovered were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors in support of China’s
economic development goals.

Key Judgments

Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246 engaged in network reconnaissance targeting
organizations in Alaska, Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia during times of economic
dialogue or publicity around China’s investment in foreign infrastructure projects
concerning China’s ﬂagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The network reconnaissance activity against Alaskan organizations increased
following the governor of Alaska’s trade delegation trip to China in late May.

Tsinghua University is also romanized as Qinghua University.

Organizations targeted by the reconnaissance activity were in industries at the heart
of the trade discussions, such as oil and gas.
The targeting of German automotive multinational Daimler AG was observed a day
after it announced a proﬁt warning in light of the growing U.S. and China trade
tensions.
The Tsinghua IP made at least one attempt to subscribe to a U.S.-based hotel’s
high-speed internet portal. We assess with low conﬁdence that this may
demonstrate an intent to breach Nomadix internet gateways within the hospitality
sector running vulnerable WindWeb servers.
The Tsinghua IP repeatedly attempted to connect with a Tibetan network that was
compromised with a highly sophisticated backdoor, “ext4.”
“ext4” only allowed incoming TCP 443 connections to the compromised network
during a 180-second window every hour, with packets requiring a unique
combination of TCP header options to successfully connect. In over 20 observed
attempts, the Tsinghua IP did not transmit the correct TCP options to activate the
backdoor. This suggested:
○ The threat actors connecting from the Tsinghua IP were ill-informed of the
correct “ext4” backdoor connection sequence and were making mistakes.
○ The targeting of the Tibetan network is not associated with the presence of
the “ext4” backdoor and the network was being probed in line with wider
geopolitical and economic network reconnaissance activity being conducted
by the Tsinghua IP.

Background
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) claims sovereignty over Tibet and regards all Tibetan
independence movements as separatist threats. While the PRC uses many forms of
coercion against the Tibetan community, cyberespionage against Tibetan targets has
become a frequently used tool, especially during times of heightened tensions. The ﬁrst
known incident of Chinese cyberespionage against Tibet, dubbed GhostNet, was in 2008.
This was part of a wider attempt to monitor foreign targets of national interest. There has
since been numerous cyberespionage campaigns documented against Tibetans, including
in Recorded Future’s recent RedAlpha report.
Tsinghua University is located in the Haidian District in Beijing. Dubbed “China’s MIT,” it is
one of China’s premier technical research universities. Chinese universities have often been
associated with Chinese state-sponsored cyber capabilities both directly and indirectly. In
2015, APT17 infrastructure was connected to a professor at China’s Southeast University,
and in 2017, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) partnered with Xi’An Jiaotong University to
create a cyber militia program. Tsinghua University is itself a state-owned institution and is

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

among the world’s top research and engineering schools. Its students’ oﬀensive cyber
capabilities are most famous through Blue-Lotus, a security research team composed of
Tsinghua University-aﬃliated individuals. The team ﬁnished second in DEF CON’s 2016
capture the ﬂag competition.
Research branches of Tsinghua University also have connections to state organizations
with a history of stealing U.S. technology. Tsinghua University’s Oﬃce of Scientiﬁc Research
and Development met with China CITIC Group for Communist Party meeting activities in
May 2018, during which they discussed strategic cooperation between enterprises and
research institutes to serve the development of the country. In the 1999 Select Committee
on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the PRC (the so-called
“Cox Report”), CITIC was linked to PLA covert operations and the theft of sensitive U.S.
technology. The Cox Report also cited an attempt in 1990 by CITIC to acquire a U.S. aircraft
parts manufacturer on behalf of the PLA in order to access U.S. export-controlled
aerospace technology. Further, CITIC’s former chairman, Wang Zhen, was involved in the
1996 Poly Technologies indictment stemming from the company’s attempt to smuggle
2,000 Chinese AK-47 assault riﬂes into the United States.
Tsinghua’s Institute of Information Systems and Engineering is also openly aﬃliated with
China’s National 863 and 973 programs. The 863 Program, also known as the State
High-Tech Development Plan, focuses on developing national capabilities within China’s key
technological industries, while the 973 Program, ﬁrst established in 1997, focuses on
developing the basic technologies required to achieve technological superiority in the key
industries. Both programs have had the eﬀect of making it easier for China to steal
intellectual property in order to achieve program goals.
In the past 10 years, a number of Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actors have been
identiﬁed conducting widespread cyberespionage directly reﬂecting China’s policy
directives to gain scientiﬁc, technical, and economic advantage in key strategic industries.
This activity can be observed most recently in operations by APT10, targeting managed IT
service providers, and APT17, which conducted massive supply chain attacks against the
popular software product CCleaner in 2017.

Recorded Future timeline of Tsinghua IP activity in correlation with Tibetan protests.

Threat Analysis
Recorded Future discovered the presence of the “ext4” backdoor during our ongoing
research into the targeting of the Tibetan community. This backdoor was conﬁgured to run
on a Linux web server running CentOS and was stealthily designed to be embedded within
a system ﬁle. The backdoor was mostly inactive other than during a three-minute window
every hour when it would activate and accept incoming connections on TCP port 443.
In total, Recorded Future’s unique coverage enabled us to observe 23 attempted
connections to the same compromised CentOS server between May and June 2018. Every
attempt originated from the same IP, 166.111.8[.]246, which resolved to the China
Education and Research Network Center. WHOIS records reveal that the IP sits within a
large /16 CIDR range registered to an address at “Tsinghua University.”

A unique selection of options in the TCP header, set at the maximum possible segment size
of 60 bytes, were observed in every packet that attempted to connect to the Tibetan
network from the Tsinghua IP, as noted in the PCAP below.

PCAP of connection attempt from Tsinghua IP to compromised Tibetan CentOS server.

The “ext4” code appears to be unique, with no prominent traces online for code or naming
similarity. Aside from our submission, no uploads of a backdoor resembling the key
characteristics of “ext4” were observed in leading multi-scanner repositories as of August 3,
2018. A detection ratio of 0/58 in VirusTotal conﬁrmed that the “ext4” sample we
discovered was a new and unique backdoor targeting the Tibetan community.
A detailed analysis of the “ext4” binary can be found in the Technical Analysis section of
this report.
Tsinghua University IP 166.111.8[.]246
This IP was ﬁrst observed in Recorded Future on March 23, 2018, and resolved to the
Chinese Education and Research Network Center (CERNET), according to several IP
enrichment sources. CERNET is one of China’s six major backbone networks and is a
catchall organization serving a large swath of addressable IP space reserved for Chinese
academic and research institutes. As noted previously, WHOIS records conﬁrm the IP sits
within a range registered to “Tsinghua University.”
Available port scan data revealed that the IP is currently conﬁgured with several actively
running services, including PPTP (TCP port 1723), MySQL (3306), and MAMP (8888), as well
as the more common OpenSSH (22), HTTP (80, 8080, 8008), SSL (443, 8443, 9443), and VPN
IKE (500) services, among others. The HTTP ports appeared to be conﬁgured as NGINX web
servers, likely as reverse proxies or load balancers, given the nature of the activity we have
observed from this IP. The large number of open ports and associated services indicate
that the Tsinghua IP may be an internet gateway or VPN endpoint.

Recorded Future Intelligence Card for Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246.

Recorded Future enrichments of the IP show that it has been the source of scanning,
brute-force attacks, and active exploitation attempts in the past. It has triggered several risk
rules, including being ﬂagged by the Taichung City Education Bureau in Taiwan, which
tracks Chinese-originating malicious cyber indicators, and appears in an AlienVault blacklist.
Metadata analysis of the IP further indicates that it is likely a gateway, NAT, or proxy, and
that the true originating machine for this activity lies behind this IP.
The same IP address was also observed conducting large-scale network reconnaissance of
organizations that were engaged in key trade discussions with Chinese state-owned entities
at the time. We believe these reconnaissance activities were not coincidental as they align
broadly with China’s strategic and economic interests.

“Opportunity Alaska”
Between April 6 and June 24, 2018, we observed over one million IP connections between
the Tsinghua IP and several networks in Alaska including:
●
●
●
●
●

The Alaska Communications Systems Group
Alaska Department of Natural Resources
Alaska Power & Telephone Company
State of Alaska Government
TelAlaska

The vast number of connections between the Tsinghua IP and the above organizations
relate to the bulk scanning of ports 22, 53, 80, 139, 443, 769, and 2816 on the Alaskan
networks and were likely conducted to ascertain vulnerabilities and gain illegitimate access.
The scanning activity was conducted in a systematic manner with entire IP ranges
dedicated to the organizations probed for the above ports.
This targeting of the the State of Alaska Government followed Alaska’s large trade mission
into China dubbed “Opportunity Alaska.” This trade mission occurred in late May and was
led by Bill Walker, governor of Alaska. During these talks, one of the highest-proﬁle
discussions occurred around the prospect of a gas pipeline between Alaska and China.
Despite fears of a China-U.S. trade war, Gov. Walker’s oﬃce stated that the trade mission
“represent[ed] some of the best Alaska has to oﬀer, and ... [highlighted] the wide scope of our
shared interests with our largest trade partner.” Opportunity Alaska consisted of delegates
from Alaskan businesses in the ﬁshing, tourism, architecture, and investment industries,
and made stops in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.

Network probing events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Alaskan institutions coinciding with Alaskan trade
delegation to China in May 2018.

Recorded Future ﬁrst observed the scanning activity against Alaskan networks in late
March, only a few weeks after Gov. Walker announced a trade delegation to China. The
activity picked up for a few days prior to the delegation arriving on May 20, 2018, and
dropped oﬀ as the delegation arrived. Probing of the Alaskan networks remained at low
levels until May 28 as the delegation concluded its activities, then ramped up considerably
as delegates left China. The spike in scanning activity at the conclusion of trade discussions
on related topics indicates that the activity was likely an attempt to gain insight into the
Alaskan perspective on the trip and strategic advantage in the post-visit negotiations.
There was a further surge in interest between June 20 and June 24 against the State of
Alaska and Alaska Department of Natural Resources networks. This was possibly in
response to Gov. Walker announcing on June 19 that he intended to visit Washington, D.C.
to meet U.S. and Chinese oﬃcials to raise his concerns on the growing trade dispute
between the two nations.
The “Belt and Road Initiative” and China’s Economic Goals
During the course of our research, we also observed the Tsinghua IP scan ports and probe
government departments and commercial entities networks in Mongolia, Kenya, and Brazil.

Each of these countries are key investment destinations as part of China’s Belt and Road
Initiative.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is one of President Xi Jinping’s most ambitious
programs. Envisaged to project China’s transformative geopolitical inﬂuence across the
world, the scale and scope of the project is unprecedented. Beijing has committed $4
trillion in investment to infrastructure and development projects in 65 countries, aﬀecting
70 percent of the world’s population and 75 percent of the world’s energy reserves. The
scheme is designed to connect major economic centers in Eurasia together over land and
sea, many of which historically served the ancient Silk Road two thousand years ago.
According to The Diplomat, “the BRI aims to stabilize China’s western peripheries, rekindle
its economy, propel non-Western international economic institutions, gain inﬂuence in
other countries, and diversify trade suppliers/routes while circumventing the U.S. pivot to
Asia.”

The BRI also aims to further strengthen China’s geopolitical and economic inﬂuence in
Africa, capitalizing on signiﬁcant infrastructure investments made across the continent.
Kenya in particular has commanded increased attention due to its strategic geographical
advantage in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) — the sea-based component of
China’s BRI initiative.
Earlier this year, Kenya announced that it would be lobbying for regional projects under the
BRI. China has already funded a 480-kilometer railway between the Kenyan port city of
Mombasa and its capital, Nairobi; the railway is eventually expected to extend to
neighboring countries Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi as well. However, in May 2018, Kenya
announced that it would not sign a free trade deal with China that had been under
discussion with East African Community (EAC) states, raising tensions between Beijing and
Nairobi.
In early June 2018, we observed the Tsinghua IP address aggressively scanning ports 22, 53,
80, 389, and 443 of various Kenyan internet-hosting providers and telecommunications
companies, as well as ranges dedicated to the Kenya Ports Authority, a state corporation
responsible for the maintenance and operation of all of Kenya’s seaports. Recorded Future
also identiﬁed network reconnaissance activities directed at the United Nations Oﬃce in
Nairobi, Kenya’s Strathmore University, and a broader national education network.
This chart below shows a clear spike in network reconnaissance activity against Kenyan
organizations from the Tsinghua IP. This spike occurred merely two weeks after Kenya
announced its intentions not to support the China-EAC free trade agreement.

Network recon events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Kenyan institutions overlayed with key China-Kenya
economic developments, March 2018 to June 2018.

In April of this year, President Xi added Brazil to the list of countries receiving Chinese
investment in infrastructure from the BRI. Funding for a new $520 million port in the
northeastern state of Maranhão was announced, building on the extensive 2016 Chinese
investment into the education and energy sectors in another Brazilian state, Amapá.
Our research uncovered repeated attempts from the Tsinghua IP to connect to the
Ministério Público do Estado Do Amapá in Brazil (Public Ministry of the State of Amapá)
between April 2 and June 11, 2018, just one month after Beijing-based China
Communications Construction Co. began construction on the Maranhão port.
We also observed repeated attempts to connect to organizational networks such as the
National Data Center Building in Mongolia and the Mongolian University of Science and
Technology between April 6 and April 12, 2018. Mongolia also plays a vital role in China’s
BRI plans; the overland component of the BRI, known as the Silk Road Economic Belt
(SREB), proposes a new Eurasia land bridge and no less than ﬁve new economic corridors,
including a China-Mongolia-Russia corridor.
We assess with medium conﬁdence that the consistent reconnaissance activity observed
from the Tsinghua IP probing networks in Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia aligns closely with

11

the BRI economic development goals, demonstrating that the threat actor using this IP is
engaged in cyberespionage on behalf of the Chinese state.

The Impact of Growing U.S. and China Trade Tensions
On June 20, 2018, German multinational automotive corporation Daimler AG was the ﬁrst
prominent company to cut its proﬁt outlook due to the escalating trade tensions between
the U.S. and China. The next day, on June 21, we observed network reconnaissance activity
speciﬁcally targeting ports 139, 22, 443, and 53 on networks resolving to Daimler AG. The
probes originated from the same Tsinghua University IP.

Interaction With U.S. Managed Hotel Network Solutions Provider
A Shodan query on the Tsinghua IP returned an HTTP 302 response serving a
“snap.safetynetaccess.com” redirection notice. Based in Needham, Massachusetts, Safety
NetAccess builds wireless networks for hotels, resorts, and other public properties; some of
its customers include Hilton, Marriott, Sonesta, and Wyndham hotel chains. According to
the Safety NetAccess website, SNAP is its “advanced back-end software program” which
provides Safety NetAccess’s agents “direct access to any and all managed equipment at any
location.” While the ﬁelds within the redirection notice may look obscure, they correspond
to portal page parameters for Nomadix Internet Gateways — Safety NetAccess’s primary
gateway and routing equipment provider.

Shodan query reveals Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246 “subscribed” to a Safety NetAccess portal.

The HTTP header response (above) showed that the Cox Communications IP
98.180.88[.]145 was originally requested by the “subscriber” (SIP), the Tsinghua IP
166.111.8[.]246. Navigating to the Cox Communications IP redirects users to a Safety
NetAccess guest internet portal at a Holiday Inn hotel based in Ocala, Florida.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

14

Breaking down the URL in the “Location” ﬁeld in the HTTP response gives us the MAC
address of the Tsinghua device (00:13:5F:07:87:D9), and the IP address of the Nomadix
device (68.105.161[.]74), shown as UIP in the URL. The UIP resolves to Cox Communications
in Ocala, Florida, and open-source research indicates that the device hosting this UIP is an
AG 3100 Nomadix rack-mounted internet gateway, supporting DNS and HTTP redirection
using a magic IP. This UIP also appears to be running a vulnerable WindWeb server on port
443. Shodan results show failed FTP login attempts to the internet gateway, as well as
Telnet events.
From the limited data available to us, we assess with low conﬁdence that the Tsinghua IP
was attempting to leverage the remote administrative access controls enabled by Safety
NetAccess’s SNAP portal for the Holiday Inn hotel in Florida.
Is the “ext4” Backdoor Associated With the Tsinghua IP?
The discovery of the “ext4” backdoor on a Tibetan device enabled us to identify the wider
targeting of the device from the Tsinghua University IP. However, none of the attempted
connections to the Tibetan device from the Tsinghua IP resulted in the successful activation
of the backdoor, leaving it unclear whether the threat actors behind the widespread
network recon activities were also responsible for the “ext4” backdoor.
That leaves us with two possible scenarios explaining the involvement of the “ext4”
backdoor on a Tibetan network with the Tsinghua IP:
1. The Tsinghua IP is being used by a threat actor to access the “ext4” backdoor, but a
technical fault or operator error is resulting in the misconﬁguration of the TCP
connection packets required to establish communication with the backdoor.
2. The Tsinghua IP is being used extensively to conduct network reconnaissance and
cyberespionage against strategic economic and national interests, not only targeting
countries that China is engaging with under BRI, but also targeting “Five Poisons2”
organizations, such as the Tibetan network. The “ext4” backdoor is therefore likely to
belong to another threat actor not engaged in the network scanning activity against
organizations outlined earlier in this report.

The “Five Poisons” are threats the Chinese Communist Party sees to its stability, including Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong,
the Chinese democracy movement, and Taiwan’s independence movement.

“ext4” backdoor key characteristics.

“ext4” is a novel Linux backdoor that was present on the victim network during the same
time that the Tsinghua IP reconnaissance activity was observed (May to June, 2018). In total,
23 attempts to connect to the victim device over TCP 443 were made from the Tsinghua IP
during this period.
The “ext4” backdoor was identiﬁed running within a legitimate system “cron” ﬁle on a
compromised CentOS web server aﬃliated with the Tibetan community. An analysis of
modiﬁed system ﬁles revealed that the “0anacron” “cron” ﬁle had been modiﬁed to execute
a non-standard binary called “ext4” located in the /usr/bin/ext4 directory on the
compromised server. The binary was conﬁgured to run hourly, and, interestingly, as a
background process. This would suppress any output from appearing on the Linux
terminal’s standard output, thus making it less detectable to the administrator of the web
server.

Modiﬁed etc/cron.hourly/0anacron script to include “ext4” backdoor function.

The “ext4” binary was relatively small at only 9511 bytes and was made up of simple
functions. It was dynamically linked to the libpcap library, which is present on Unix systems
to allow the capturing of packets (pcap ﬁles) typically used by “network sniﬀers.”
There were three primary functions that drive the operation of the backdoor: “main,”
“process,” and “my_pcap_handler.” All of these functions ﬂow together to perform the main
functionality of the backdoor.
Main Function
The main function performed three central tasks: to remove the ﬁle “tmp/0baaf161db39,”
to create a child process that executes the backdoor functionality, and to set a sleep timer
of 180 seconds. The process is terminated when the sleep timer limit is reached.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

17

Additionally, the main function also checked the command line arguments to determine
which network interface to monitor on the compromised network. By default, “ext4” used
“eth0.”
Process Function
The main purpose of the process function was to create a handle to capture network
traﬃc, which was done by use of the libpcap function, “pcap_open_live.”

Once the handle had been created, another libpcap function, “pcap_loop,” was executed,
which processed all of the packets sent to the interface speciﬁed in “pcap_open_live” and

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

18

sent them to the function “my_packet_handler” to parse and perform actions based on the
type of packet sent.
“my_packet_handler” Function
All packets sent to a speciﬁed network interface were received by the “my_packet_handler”
function. The handler then parsed the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers3 to perform a series of
checks to validate if it is a packet that it is meant to process. Once validated, the function
decoded the payload, which would typically be a command fed to a bash shell on the
compromised CentOS host.
The below steps demonstrate the parsing and validation criteria the function used to
ensure that it processed the correct packets. If at any point the function receives
unexpected results, the packet is dropped from the function and the next one is processed.

Check the ethernet header to ensure the type is IP (Type 2048).
IP header length is parsed from the IP header.
Parse the IP header to ensure the protocol is TCP (Type 6).
Parse the TCP header to ensure the destination port is 443.
Find the data oﬀset or the start of the payload.
Check that the TCP ﬂags equal 322, which equates to the following ﬂags being set:
NS (Nonce Sum), ECE (ECN-Echo), and SYN.

For reference, we have provided a table in Appendix A that shows the oﬀsets for the ethernet, IP, and TCP headers. This can
be used to help follow how this function parses the headers.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

19

The breakdown of the ﬂags is important, as it looks for the SYN and ECE to be set, as well as
the NS ﬂag. The NS ﬂag is used to protect against accidental or malicious concealment of
marked packets from the TCP sender.
The ECE ﬂag is responsible for indicating if the TCP peer is Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation
(ECN) compatible. ECN is an optional extension to TCP that prevents packets being dropped
due to congestion. While the use of ECN can be normal in larger enterprises with
ECN-capable routers, the use of the NS bit seems to be experimental and is not oﬃcially
used in any TCP implementations.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0816 |

20

If a packet passes all of the criteria, the function gets the length of the payload and checks
that it is between ﬁve and 1024 bytes. After that, it allocates memory and then saves the
payload into memory.
The payload is XOR-encoded, and the ﬁrst byte of the payload is the XOR key. The function
will use the ﬁrst byte of payload to decode the next ﬁve bytes and check to see if they equal
the string “anti:.”

If the decoded bytes equal “anti:,” then the rest of payload will be decoded and passed as a
ﬁnal argument to run a bash command using the execl call.

Outlook
China continues to use cyber operations to monitor and track threats to domestic stability,
neatly summarized as the “Five Poisons.” This focus on domestic threats enables security
researchers to identify new campaigns and tools being aggressively used against
persecuted communities. “ext4” is a sophisticated lightweight Linux backdoor designed to
enable the threat actor to access the compromised device and conduct further malicious
activity. It is also an example of a tool probably being used by Chinese nation-state actors
to target the Tibetan community.
Further, the widespread use of CentOS servers, many of which are unpatched and used in
production systems, highlights the breadth of the potential attack surface.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its long-term investment in African infrastructure has
enabled China to wield massive inﬂuence in those countries targeted by these policies. We
assess with medium conﬁdence that the widespread network reconnaissance activities
emanating from Tsinghua University infrastructure and targeting economic interests in
Kenya, Mongolia, and Brazil are state directed.
China has repeatedly conducted cyberespionage in support of its national economic
interests. In November 2017, the DOJ indicted three Chinese hackers found guilty of
economic cyberespionage. Further, in its recent report on Foreign Economic Espionage in
Cyberspace, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center highlighted Chinese
threat actors APT10, KeyBoy, and Temp.Periscope as having conducted extensive
cyberespionage in support of strategic national and economic beneﬁt.
Other than the discovery of the “ext4” backdoor targeting the Tibetan community, we have
not identiﬁed the presence of malware in any of the documented organizations in this
report, as the bulk of our analysis was based on third-party metadata. However, we assess
with medium conﬁdence that the targeted scanning and probing of networks during the
timeframe of bilateral trade and strategic dialogue between China and its Alaskan, Kenyan,
Brazilian, and Mongolian counterparts indicates the activity is being conducted by a threat
actor (or multiple threat actors with access to the same Tsinghua endpoint) directed by the
Chinese state.
Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures when
defending against hostile network reconnaissance and the potential deployment of a
CentOS backdoor from the Chinese threat actor detailed in this report:

hosts on networks for presence of the backdoor.
If applicable, ensure the “ext4” Yara rule is deployed to the endpoint protection
appliance used in your organization.
Scan Linux hosts for the presence of the “/usr/bin/ext4” and “/tmp/0baaf161db39”
ﬁles.

Additionally, we advise organizations to follow the following general information security
best practice guidelines:

Keep all software and applications up to date; in particular, operating systems,
antivirus software, and core system utilities.
Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.
Make regular backups of your system and store the backups oﬄine, preferably
oﬀ-site so that data cannot be accessed via the network.
Have a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan.
Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In particular, look
at which data anyone with access to an employee account or device would have
access to (for example, through device or account takeover through phishing).
Strongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide data access,
and restricting access to sensitive data.
Employ host-based controls — one of the best defenses and warning signals to
thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and intrusion detection
capabilities.
Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and controls like
network IDS, netﬂow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside human
monitoring of detection sources.
Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to monitor and
enforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an important part of any
organization’s security posture.
