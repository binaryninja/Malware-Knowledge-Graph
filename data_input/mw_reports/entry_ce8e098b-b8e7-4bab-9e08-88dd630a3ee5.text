Initial Access Brokers
Are Key to Rise in
Ransomware Attacks

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

This report provides an overview of the tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) used by cybercriminals on dark web and special-access sources to
compromise networks, deploy infostealer malware, and obtain valid credentials.
These threat actors, dubbed “initial access brokers”, represent a specialized
industry within the cybercriminal underground that enables a significant majority
of ransomware attacks. This report includes information gathered using the
Recorded Future​®​ Platform, dark web sources, and open-source intelligence
(OSINT) techniques. This is a high-level summary of the chain of events that
enable a ransomware attack. It is intended to provide an overview for cybersecurity
professionals with non-technical backgrounds or roles.

Background

Threat actors require remote access to compromised
networks to conduct successful attacks, such as malware
loader deployment, data exfiltration, or espionage campaigns.
These compromised access methods, often sold on dark web
and special-access forums, are the work of specialized threat
actors colloquially referred to as “initial access brokers” (IAB).
IABs use several tools and TTPs to obtain such access, including

Deploying Stealers

One of the most effective ways for ransomware operators to
gain access to victim networks is by either deploying infostealer
malware or obtaining logs exfiltrated by an infostealer on a
dark web or special-access source. This malware is deployed
through the use of acquired or compromised botnets, phishing,
the successful deployment of an obfuscated malware loader or
dropper, or through the purchase of compromised credentials
on dark web and special access sources.

Infostealers, generally considered to be a subgroup of
the banking or remote access trojan (RAT) malware category,
can capture a great amount of compromised information from
an infected device, including keystrokes and peripheral input
captures, session cookies, usernames and passwords from
browser stores, screen and video captures, local data, browser
history and bookmarks, clipboard data, and more. The most
common attack vectors by which infostealers spread is through
spam campaigns or phishing. Less commonly, but as evidenced
by the rapid spread of Mars Stealer in Q1 2022, infostealers can
spread via malicious Google Ads and pop-ups. These infostealer
payloads can be disguised within Microsoft Office documents
through the use of malicious macros; a dropper that encrypts
the payload as extra data; or a loader that communicates with
its command and control (C2) infrastructure over a web protocol
and uses a built-in command and scripting interpreter to remotely
execute code. Once an infostealer successfully infects a victim
device, it begins to log activities and collect compromised
information. These logs are then manually examined by the
infostealer operator for credentials that might be profitable (for
example, credentials for tools or platforms like RDP, VPNs, or
WordPress) on dark web or special-access sources. At this point,
an infostealer operator could become an initial access broker for
ransomware and data leak groups on dark web forums.

Compromised Valid Credentials
To easily obtain bulk compromised valid credentials and
session cookies, threat actors often rent access to a licensed
account for an infostealer malware. These licenses come in many
forms, but most often as web panels, source code, builders,
or standalone clients. Infostealers are often marketed directly
by their developers as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering
on top-tier dark web and special-access sources, messaging
platforms (such as Telegram), and social media. The information
harvested from infostealers, colloquially referred to as “logs” or
“bots”, is then sold on dark web shops, such as Genesis Store,
Russian Market, the now-defunct Amigos Market, and 2easy
Shop. The most common infostealers that appear on dark web
and special-access sources are RedLine, Vidar, FickerStealer,
Taurus, AZORult, and the now-defunct Raccoon.

According to CISA, Conti affiliates use a variety of initial access strategies against infostealer malware should be incorporated:
vectors including phishing, compromised credentials, malware
distribution, and exploiting vulnerabilities. CISA and the FBI
have observed Conti’s operators using Router Scan, a tool to
scan and brute-force network devices. The attackers would
also use kerberoasting to discover and crack administrator
hashes. Once they successfully achieve Domain Administrator
rights, they begin exfiltrating sensitive data using Rclone and
mega[.]nz. When the threat actors are satisfied with the data
they captured and the network defenses have been removed,
they begin preparing the network to deploy the ransomware.
As we saw with the BlackMatter case study, Conti will place the
ransomware executable in a location such as SYSVOL on the
Domain Controller and then set up a domain-wide scheduled
task to execute the ransomware under the highest privileges
achieved.

• Keep all systems current with the latest security patches
and updates.
• Invest in a solution that offers patch posture reporting.
This type of solution can provide insight into the
vulnerabilities that have received remediation measures
as well as the machines that have received those
patches.
• Install an antivirus solution, schedule signature updates,
and monitor the antivirus status on all equipment.
• Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion
prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense
mechanisms in place to alert on any malicious activity.
• Deploy a spam filter used to detect indicators of
phishing, such as viruses, blank senders, and keyword
text triggers.
• Deploy a web filter to block malicious websites.
• Monitor for suspicious changes to system file drives and
Registry that focus on the interception of keystrokes.
• Educate your employees and conduct training sessions
with mock phishing scenarios.
• Develop a password security policy that includes but is
not limited to password expiration and complexity.
• Require encryption for employees, especially employees
working remotely. This includes whole-disc, such as 256bit AES, and network encryption via SSL or TLS.
• For enterprises, Recorded Future can monitor for
potential typosquat domains weaponized in phishing
attacks. This includes not only the domains belonging to
one organization, but third-party partners and vendors
with enterprise network access.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

• The Recorded Future Platform can also assist with
the detection of compromised credential information
linked to valid accounts to assist in providing context
surrounding suspicious user behavior that may include
keylogging activity. Recorded Future Platform users can
continue to monitor underground sources to identify the
spyware and keylogging tools that are likely to be the
most harmful to their immediate infrastructure or supply
chain.

Ransomware
Maintain offline backups of your organization’s data and
ensure that these backups stay up to date to prevent data loss
in the event of a ransomware infection. Additionally, Recorded
Future recommends the following mitigations to reduce overall
risk:

• Through the use of process monitoring, monitor for the
execution and command of binaries involved in data
destruction activity, such as vssadmin, wbadmin, and
bcdedit.
• Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification
activity, particularly large quantities of file modifications
in user directories.
• Consider keeping sensitive client information on systems
disconnected from the internet or segmented from the
rest of the corporate network. Since ransomware will
encrypt all files on a victim system and often will search
for directories on the network (such as networked file
shares) to also encrypt, moving highly sensitive customer
data to a system with no internet access or access to the
rest of the network will minimize the access ransomware
would have to those files.

• Ransomware often follows a specific pattern of behavior
that can be detected with a robust threat intelligence
system, integrated with SIEM platforms.
• Implement YARA rules like the ones found in
Recorded Future Hunting Packages to identify
malware via signature-based detection or SNORT
rules for endpoint-based detections.
• The IOCs provided throughout this report can be
used to proactively query or scan environments
for items such as file hashes, registry keys, and IP
traffic associated with ransomware.
• Network segmentation can halt the propagation of
ransomware through an organization’s network. This
solution involves splitting the larger network into
smaller network segments and can be accomplished
through firewalls, virtual local area networks, and other
separation techniques.
• If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations,
all remote access services and protocols, such as Citrix
and RDP, should be implemented with two-factor or
multi-factor authentication.
• Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers
are also abused by threat actors to gain initial
access into a target’s network. Threat actors will
look for networks that have internet-facing servers
running RDP and then exploit vulnerabilities
in those servers or use brute-force password
attacks. Once inside the network, the threat actors
move laterally and install ransomware on target
machines, often disabling backups and other
protections.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outlook
Infostealer malware and exfiltrated logs will remain popular
among threat actors as a means to obtain credentials to gain
access to victim networks. While some infostealer variants,
such as RedLine, FickerStealer, and AZORult have endured, new
variants like Mars Stealer, MetaStealer, and Eternity will continue
to emerge. Dark web shops and marketplaces will also remain an
attractive source of infostealer logs for threat actors. However,
the most effective method by which a ransomware affiliate can
gain initial access to a compromised network is through the use
of an IAB on dark web and special-access forums. Other attack
vectors by which initial access is gained is through the use of
a RAT, phishing, spearphishing, and other social engineering
attacks. The process by which ransomware operators and
affiliates infect networks following initial access can be very
quick and often undetectable.
