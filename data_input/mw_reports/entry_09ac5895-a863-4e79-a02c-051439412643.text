Mirai, RAR1Ransom, and GuardMiner – Multiple Malware Campaigns Target
VMware Vulnerability
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/multiple-malware-campaigns-target-vmware-vulnerability
October 20, 2022

In April, VMware patched a vulnerability CVE-2022-22954. It causes server-side template injection because of the lack of
sanitization on parameters “deviceUdid” and “devicetype”. It allows attackers to inject a payload and achieve remote code
execution on VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager. FortiGuard Labs published Threat Signal Report about it
and also developed IPS signature in April.
We observed attacks in the wild since then. Most of the payloads focus on probing a victim’s sensitive data, for example,
passwords, hosts file, etc. But in August, there were a few particular payloads, which got our interest. They had the intention of
deploying Mirai targeting exposed networking devices running Linux, RAR1ransom that leverages legitimate WinRaR to deploy
encryption, and GuardMiner that is a variant of xmrig used to “mine” Monero.
In this blog, we will elaborate on how these malware leveraged the VMware vulnerability and the behavior after exploitation in
more detail.
Affected platforms: VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager
Impacted parties: VMware users
Impact: Attacker can exploit the vulnerability to launch a command injection attack by sending some messages with malicious
commands
Severity level: Critical

Mirai Variant
The complete payload from Mirai is shown in Figure 2, it enters temp directory and downloads Mirai variant from
http[:]//107[.]189[.]8[.]21/pedalcheta/cutie[.]x86_64, then executes with parameter “VMware”.
Figure 2 Attacking traffic capture
Figure 3 Decoded command
Like most Mirai botnets, this variant’s main jobs include deploying DoS and launching a brute force attack. We can decode part of
the configuration after we XOR the data with 0x54 and get C2 server is “cnc[.]goodpackets[.]cc”. Following is the decoded strings:
Figure 4 Decoded configuration string
We also identify the brute force function with encoded account and password strings:
Figure 5 Functions for brute force attack
The decoded passwords are listed below, they are commonly used passwords and also some default credentials for well-known
IoT devices:

After being executed, the variant shows hardcoded string “InfectedNight did its job”, and sends heartbeat along with parameter
“VMware”, then it will wait for further commands from C2 server. Below is the traffic session from heartbeat and brute force
attack.

Initialization Script for RAR1Ransom and GuardMiner
Another noticeable payload is from 67[.]205[.]145[.]142. It contains two sessions, each has different commands depending on the
victim’s operation system. One leveraged PowerShell to download “init.ps1”, the other uses curl, wget, and urlopen in Python
library to download “init.sh”.
Figure 8 Attack traffic capture for Windows
Figure 9 Attack traffic capture for Linux
From the PowerShell script file “init.ps1”, it includes a few links to cloudflare-ipfs[.]com for further attack and each file has its own
backup link to crustwebsites[.]net.
Figure 10 Download links in init.ps1
There are 7 files for initialization:
phpupdate.exe: Xmrig Monero mining software
config.json: Configuration file for mining pools
networkmanager.exe: Executable used to scan and spread infection
phpguard.exe: Executable used for guardian Xmrig miner to keep running
init.ps1: Script file itself to sustain persistance via creating scheduled task
clean.bat: Script file to remove other cryptominers on the compromised host
encrypt.exe: RAR1 ransomware
Figure 11 "start encrypt" section in init.ps1
In the “start encrypt” section shown in Figure 11, it first checks “flag_encrypt.flag” before launching RAR1ransom, if the flag file
existed and the “encrypt.exe” was also download before, it will delete “encrypt.exe” and go to the next stage. Otherwise, it checks
the file size to determine if the file path should be updated or not. Finally, it executes the ransomware after checking process. The
detail of RAR1 ransomware will be elaborated in the next section.
Then, the script starts the GuardMiner attack. GuardMiner is a cross-platform mining Trojan, which has been active since 2020.
And FortiGuard Labs has a detailed report covering it. In this version, it also drops the script file “init.sh” for Linux system.
Figure 12 “init.sh” for Linux
We also noticed that GuardMiner updates “networkmanager.exe” with the more recently vulnerability. From the name of each
exploit module, it might collect the exploit list from Chaitin Tech Github which is for security testing purposes.
Figure 13 rdata section contains vulnerability list in networkmanager.exe

RAR1Ransom
RAR1ransom drops “rar.exe” in C:/Windows/Temp folder which is legitimate WinRaR software to compress a victim’s files with a
password. It uses several default options in WinRaR to complete the encryption for efficiency, we can locate these processes from
Process Explorer in Figure 14.
Figure 14 Processes while RAR1Ransom encrypted files
The whole command is below, options “df” and “m0” mean delete files after adding files to archive without compression, “mt10”
means it will use ten threads, and “ep” means exclude path from name. The “hp” is to encrypt both file data and headers with
password.
C:/Windows/Temp/rar.exe a -df -m0 -mt10 -ep hpVbDsLHSfbomQiQ6YuP7m1ZaNP0LQqYpzrkjwvuNSjsnQlicOxNPi0iKzKeQO1Besbpbx1iKWNeOfFQDEw8qaoAGmN1Nx9i0vbUcr
"C:/Python27/Lib/json/MVXGG33EMVZC44DZ.rar1" "C:/Python27/Lib/json/MVXGG33EMVZC44DZ"
RAR1Ransom targets a compromised victim’s file with particular extensions as in Figure 15.
Figure 15 Target file extension
All the encrypted files will have an unique filename and “.rar1” extension, and it drops a text file “READ_TO_DECRYPT.txt” in the
same folder with message in Figure 17.

Figure 17 Ransom note
From the wallet string in the ransom note, which is identical with the one in the miner’s configuration shown in Figure 17. We can
tell the attacker intends to utilize a victim’s resources as much as possible, not only to install RAR1Ransom for extortion, but also
to spread GuardMiner to collect cryptocurrency.

Conclusion
Although the critical vulnerability CVE-2022-22954 is already patched in April, there are still multiple malware campaigns trying to
exploit it. Users should always keep systems updated and patched and be aware of any suspicious process in environment.
These Mirai variants, RAR1Ransom, and GuardMiner are not extremely complicated samples, but their methods are always
changing and evolving. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor and provide the latest updates.
