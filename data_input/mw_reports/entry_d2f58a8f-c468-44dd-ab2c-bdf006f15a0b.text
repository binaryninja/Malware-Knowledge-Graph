ESET researchers uncover a supply-chain attack used in a cyberespionage operation targeting
online‑gaming communities in Asia
UPDATE (February 3rd, 2021):
Following the publication of our research, BigNox have contacted us to say that their initial denial of the
compromise was a misunderstanding on their part and that they have since taken these steps to
improve security for their users:

1/20

use only HTTPS to deliver software updates in order to minimize the risks of domain hijacking and
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
implement file integrity verification using MD5 hashing and file signature checks
adopt additional measures, notably encryption of sensitive data, to avoid exposing users’ personal
information
BigNox have also stated that they have pushed the latest files to the update server for NoxPlayer and
that, upon startup, NoxPlayer will now run a check of the application files previously installed on the
users’ machines.
ESET assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided by BigNox.
During 2020, ESET research reported various supply-chain attacks, such as the case of WIZVERA
VeraPort, used by government and banking websites in South Korea, Operation StealthyTrident
compromising the Able Desktop chat software used by several Mongolian government agencies, and
Operation SignSight, compromising the distribution of signing software distributed by the Vietnamese
government.
In January 2021, we discovered a new supply-chain attack compromising the update mechanism of
NoxPlayer, an Android emulator for PCs and Macs, and part of BigNox’s product range with over 150
million users worldwide.
This software is generally used by gamers in order to play mobile games from their PCs, making this
incident somewhat unusual.
Three different malware families were spotted being distributed from tailored malicious updates to
selected victims, with no sign of leveraging any financial gain, but rather surveillance-related capabilities.
We spotted similarities in loaders we have been monitoring in the past with some of the ones used in this
operation, such as instances we discovered in a Myanmar presidential office website supply-chain
compromise on 2018, and in early 2020 in an intrusion into a Hong Kong university.

About BigNox
BigNox is a company based in Hong Kong, which provides various products, primarily an Android
emulator for PCs and Macs called NoxPlayer. The company’s official website claims that it has over 150
million users in more than 150 countries speaking 20 different languages. However, it’s important to note
that the BigNox follower base is predominantly in Asian countries.
BigNox also wrote an extensive blogpost in 2019 on the use of VPNs in conjunction with NoxPlayer,
showing the company’s concern for their users’ privacy.
We have contacted BigNox about the intrusion, and they denied being affected. We have also offered
our support to help them past the disclosure in case they decide to conduct an internal investigation.

Am I compromised?
Who is affected: NoxPlayer users.

2/20

How to determine if I received a malicious update or not: check if any ongoing process has an
active network connection with known active C&C servers, or see if any of the malware based on
the file names we provided in the report is installed in:
C:\ProgramData\Sandboxie\SbieIni.dat
C:\ProgramData\Sandboxie\SbieDll.dll
C:\ProgramData\LoGiTech\LBTServ.dll
C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\ieproxysocket64.dll
C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\ieproxysocket.dll
a file named %LOCALAPPDATA%\Nox\update\UpdatePackageSilence.exe not digitally
signed by BigNox.
How to stay safe:
In case of intrusion – standard reinstall from clean media.
For non-compromised users: do not download any updates until BigNox notifies that it has
mitigated the threat.

Timeline
Based on ESET telemetry, we saw the first indicators of compromise in September 2020, and activity
continued until we uncovered explicitly malicious activity on January 25th, 2021, at which point we
reported the incident to BigNox.

Victimology
In comparison to the overall number of active NoxPlayer users, there is a very small number of victims.
According to ESET telemetry, more than 100,000 of our users have Noxplayer installed on their
machines. Among them, only 5 users received a malicious update, showing that Operation NightScout is
a highly targeted operation. The victims are based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka.

3/20

Figure 1. Asia victimology map

We were unsuccessful finding correlations that would suggest any relationships among victims.
However, based on the compromised software in question and the delivered malware exhibiting
surveillance capabilities, we believe this may indicate the intent of collecting intelligence on targets
somehow involved in the gaming community.
It is important to highlight that, in contrast with similar previous operations such as the Winnti Group
activity targeting the gaming industry in 2019, we haven’t found indicators that would suggest
indiscriminate proliferation of malicious updates among a large number NoxPlayer users, reinforcing our
belief that this is a highly targeted operation.

Update mechanism
In order to understand the dynamics of this supply-chain attack, it’s important to know what vector was
used in order to deliver malware to NoxPlayer users. This vector was NoxPlayer’s update mechanism.

4/20

On launch, if NoxPlayer detects a newer version of the software, it will prompt the user with a message
box (Figure 2) to offer the option to install it.

Figure 2. NoxPlayer update prompt

This is done by querying the update server via the BigNox HTTP API (api.bignox.com) in order to
retrieve specific update information, as seen in Figure 3.

5/20

Figure 3. NoxPlayer client update API request

The response to this query contains update-specific information such as the update binary URL, its size,
MD5 hash and other additional related information as seen in Figure 4.

6/20

Figure 4. NoxPlayer server API reply

Upon pressing the “Update now” button from Figure 1, the main NoxPlayer binary application Nox.exe
will supply the update parameters received to another binary in its toolbox NoxPack.exe, which is in
charge of downloading the update itself, as can be seen in Figure 5.

After this is done, the progress bar in the message box will reflect the state of the download (Figure 6),
and when completed the update has been performed.

Supply-chain compromise indicators
We have sufficient evidence to state that the BigNox infrastructure (res06.bignox.com) was
compromised to host malware, and also to suggest that their HTTP API infrastructure (api.bignox.com)
could have been compromised. In some cases, additional payloads were downloaded by the BigNox
updater from attacker-controlled servers. This suggests that the URL field, provided in the reply from the
BigNox API, was tampered with by the attackers. The intrusion flow observed is depicted in Figure 7.

9/20

Figure 7. Intrusion flow sequence diagram

An overview of what’s shown in the sequence diagram above is the following:
1. On launch, the primary NoxPlayer executable Nox.exe sends a request via the API to query
update information.
2. The BigNox API server responds to the client request with specific update information, including
the URL to download the update from BigNox legitimate infrastructure.
3. Nox.exe provides the appropriate parameters to NoxPlayer.exe to download the update.
4. The legitimate update stored in BigNox infrastructure could have been replaced with malware, or it
may be a new filename/URL not used by legitimate updates.
5. Malware is installed on the victim’s machine. Contrary to legitimate BigNox updates, the malicious
files are not digitally signed, strongly suggesting that the BigNox build system was not
compromised, but just its systems that distribute updates.
6. Some reconnaissance of the victim is performed and information sent to the malware operators.

10/20

7. The perpetrators tailor malicious updates to specific victims of interest based on some unknown
filtering scheme.
8. Nox.exe will perform sporadic update requests.
9. The BigNox API server responds to the client with update information, which states that the update
is stored in the attacker-controlled infrastructure.
10. Further malware gets delivered to selected victims.
With this information we can highlight several things:
Legitimate BigNox infrastructure was delivering malware for specific updates. We observed that
these malicious updates were only taking place in September 2020.
Furthermore, we observed that for specific victims, malicious updates were downloaded from
attacker-controlled infrastructure subsequently and throughout the end of 2020 and early 2021.
We are highly confident that these additional updates were performed by Nox.exe supplying
specific parameters to NoxPack.exe, suggesting that the BigNox API mechanism may have also
been compromised to deliver tailored malicious updates.
It could also suggest the possibility that victims were subjected to a MitM attack, although we
believe this hypothesis is unlikely since the victims we discovered are in different countries, and
attackers already had a foothold on the BigNox infrastructure.
Furthermore, we were able to reproduce the download of the malware samples hosted on
res06.bignox.com from a test machine and using https. This discards the possibility that a MitM
attack was used to tamper with the update binary.
It is also important to mention that malicious updates downloaded from the attacker-controlled
infrastructure mimicked the path of legitimate updates:
Malicious update to attacker-controlled infrastructure:
http://cdn.cloudfronte[.]com/player/upgrade/ext/20201030/1/35e3797508c555d5f5e19f721cf94700.exe
Legitimate NoxPlayer update:
http://res06.bignox[.]com/player/upgrade/202012/1b31bced0a564bed9f60264f061dcdae.exe
Furthermore, registered attacker-controlled domain names mimicked the BigNox CDN network domain
name, that being cloudfront.net.
These indicators suggest that attackers were trying to avoid detection so that they could remain under
the radar and achieve long-term persistence.

Malware
A total of three different malicious update variants were observed, each of which dropped different
malware. These variants are the following:

Malicious Update variant 1
This variant is one of the preliminary updates pointing to compromised BigNox infrastructure. Our
analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 CA4276033A7CBDCCDE26105DEC911B215A1CE5CF.
The malware delivered does not seem to have been documented before. It is not extremely complex, but
it has enough capabilities to monitor its victims. The initial RAR SFX archive drops two DLLs into
C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\ and runs one of them, depending on architecture, via rundll32.exe.

11/20

The names of these DLLs are the following:
ieproxysocket64.dll
ieproxysocket.dll
It also drops a text file named KB911911.LOG to disk, into which the original name of the SFX installer
will be written. The DLL attempts to open and read this log file, and if not found will stop execution,
therefore implementing an execution guardrail.
The DLL will then check whether it has been loaded by any of the following processes; if it has, it will
stop its own execution:
smss.exe
winlogon.exe
csrss.exe
wininit.exe
services.exe
explorer.exe
The IP address of the machine will be checked to verify that it is neither 127.0.0.1 nor 0.0.0.0; if it is, it
will be rechecked in an infinite loop until it changes. Otherwise, it will proceed to extract the UUID of the
current machine via a WMI object query. This returned UUID is hashed using MD5 to serialize the
current victim. Account name information will also be retrieved and saved.
An encrypted configuration will be retrieved from the DLL’s resource. This configuration is encrypted
using a two-byte XOR with 0x5000. The encrypted configuration is partially visible given the weakness of
the key used:

Figure 8. Encrypted configuration in resources

The format of this configuration is the following (roughly):

0x14

0x198

0x38

Variable holding offset start of decoded configuration buffer

After the configuration has been parsed, the backdoor will check several times for network monitoring
processes before transferring execution to the C&C loop. Operation stops if the Operate flag is set or if
either of the following processes is running:
netman.exe
wireshark.exe
The backdoor can use either a raw IP address or a domain name to communicate with the C&C server.
After successful connection to the C&C, the malware will be able to perform the following commands:
Command ID

getfilelist-delete

Delete specified files from the disk

getfilelist-run

Run a command via the WinExec API

getfilelist-upload

Figure 9. Anatomy of malicious update variant 1

Malicious Update variant 2
This malware variant was also spotted being downloaded from legitimate BigNox infrastructure. Our
analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 E45A5D9B03CFBE7EB2E90181756FDF0DD690C00C.
It contains several files comprising what is known as a trident bundle, in which a signed executable is
used to load a malicious DLL, which will decrypt and load a shellcode, implementing a reflective loader
for the final payload.
The theme for this trident bundle was to disguise the malware as Sandboxie components. The names of
the bundled components are the following:
Filename

Description

C:\ProgramData\Sandboxie\SandboxieBITS.exe

Signed Sandboxie COM Services (BITS)

C:\ProgramData\Sandboxie\SbieDll.dll

Malicious hijacked DLL

C:\ProgramData\Sandboxie\SbieIni.dat

Malicious encrypted payload; decrypts a
reflectively loaded instance of Gh0st RAT

C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\delself.bat

Script to self-delete the initial executable

C:\Windows\System32\wmkawe_3636071.data

Text file containing the sentence Stupid
Japanese

We have encountered other instances of this same text file, dropped by a very similar loader in a supplychain compromise involving the Myanmar presidential office website in 2018, and in an intrusion into a
Hong Kong university in 2020.
The deployed final payload was a variant of Gh0st RAT with keylogger capabilities.

15/20

Figure 10. Anatomy of malicious update variant 2

Malicious Update variant 3
This update variant was only spotted in activity subsequent to initial malicious updates, downloaded from
attacker-controlled infrastructure. Our analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1
AA3D31A1A6FE6888E4B455DADDA4755A6D42BEEB.

16/20

Similarly, as with the previous variant, this malicious update comes bundled in an MFC file, and extracts
two components: a benign signed file and a dependency of it. The components are:
Filename

Description

C:\ProgramData\LoGiTech\LoGitech.exe

Signed Logitech binary

C:\ProgramData\LoGiTech\LBTServ.dll

Malicious DLL decrypts and reflectively loads an instance
of PoisonIvy

On the most recently discovered victims, the initial downloaded binary was written in Delphi, while for
previous victims the same attacker-controlled URL dropped a binary written in C++. These binaries are
the initial preliminary loaders. Although the loaders were written in different programming languages,
both versions deployed the same final payload, that being an instance of the PoisonIvy RAT.

Conclusion
We have detected various supply-chain attacks in the last year, such as Operation SignSight or the
compromise of Able Desktop among others. However, the supply-chain compromise involved in
Operation NightScout is particularly interesting due to the targeted vertical, as we rarely encounter many
cyberespionage operations targeting online gamers.
Supply-chain attacks will continue to be a common compromise vector leveraged by cyber-espionage
groups, and its complexity may impact the discovery and mitigation of these type of incidents.
