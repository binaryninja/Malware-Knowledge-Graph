May 11, 2021

The recent ransomware intrusion of a major US gasoline pipeline operator was the work of
an affiliate of DarkSide, a ransomware-as-a-service ring that has been responsible for at
least 60 known cases of double-extortion so far this year. DarkSide has struck several highprofile victims recently, including companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. But the
disruption of Colonial Pipeline’s network led to the company shutting down its operational
technology (OT) network as well—effectively cutting off a majority of the gasoline supply to
the eastern United States.
Colonial Pipeline’s shutdown is not the first critical infrastructure issue triggered by a
ransomware attack. Last February, a US-based natural gas facility was shut down for two
days by a ransomware intrusion that spread to its OT network. And DarkSide has not
avoided these types of companies, either, hitting a Brazilian energy company earlier this
year. But the Colonial incident has potentially greater real-world impact—and has apparently
made DarkSide’s operators more notorious than they’re comfortable with.
The Sophos Rapid Response team has been called in for incident response or to intervene
during an attack involving DarkSide on at least five different instances in the past year.

Coming over to DarkSide
DarkSide emerged last summer, gaining notice with its purported “honor among thieves”
approach: the gang claimed to have a code of conduct that forbid targeting industries and
non-profit organizations connected to the public interest.
The ring has struggled to keep its “honorable” reputation, using their leak site as a platform
to counter bad news. When ransomware recovery company Coveware warned that
DarkSide’s use of Iranian hosting posed potential peril of sanctions violations if companies
paid them, DarkSide’s operators posted a “press release” denying they used any Iranian IT
services. The Colonial Pipeline attack again has the DarkSide gang backpedaling, pleading
in a post on their web page that they are “apolitical” and that their goal is “to make money,
and not creating problems for society.”

The ransomware threat actors claim their actions are ‘apolitical’
The gang previously promised to spare healthcare organizations, as well as others involved
in vaccine distribution, because of the negative attention such attacks could potentially bring
from within the gang’s home country. Because of the way DarkSide operates, it’s not clear
how much control the keepers of the DarkSide brand have over the affiliates who do the
actual work of breaking into networks and launching their ransomware.

DarkSide’s affiliate ad: “Who are we looking for? A limited number of stable and adequate
partners who understand why it is necessary to upload data, what is backups and how to
delete them, Russian-speaking, with payouts from 500k.”
DarkSide follows in the footsteps of double-extortion ransomware operators such as REvil,
Maze, and LockBit—exfiltrating business data before encrypting it, and threatening public
release if the victims don’t pay for a decryption key. Like those other targeted operations,
DarkSide makes hefty ransom demands. In one case Sophos Rapid Response worked on
last year, the ring demanded $4 million (which went unpaid).
Beyond the business model, DarkSide follows generally the same tactics, techniques, and
procedures of many other targeted ransomware campaigns — a mix of native Windows
features, commodity malware (including SystemBC), and off-the-shelf system and exploit
tools (including Cobalt Strike). This is in part because of DarkSide’s affiliate model.
The creators of DarkSide outsource the initial compromise of targets and deployment of
DarkSide’s cryptographic ransomware to network penetration specialists, who hand off
ransom victim “customer service” to DarkSide’s core operators. Those affiliates likely have

prior experience playing the same role for other ransomware syndicates.
In Sophos’ experience in data forensics and incident response to DarkSide attacks, the initial
access to the target’s network came primarily as a result of phished credentials. This is not
the only way ransomware attackers can gain a foothold but it seems to be prevalent in cases
involving this type of ransomware, possibly as a result of the affiliates’ preferences.
Unlike some other ransomware players, DarkSide is capable of encrypting Linux computers
as well as those running Windows, which makes it a more desirable tool for threat actors
who want to target large enterprises.
While some recent targeted ransomware operations from other gangs have sprung quickly,
launching their attack within days, the actors behind DarkSide campaigns may spend weeksto-months poking around inside an organization’s network before activating their
ransomware payload.

Over the course of that dwell time, the intruders exfiltrate as much data as possible.
Darkside’s ransom notes claim the theft of large amounts of data, often from several
departments within an organization, such as Accounting and R&D. Using PSExec, Remote
Desktop connections, and (in the case of Linux servers) SSH to move laterally within the
network, the DarkSide actors uploaded archives of stolen files to the cloud storage providers
Mega or pCloud in cases we’ve investigated.

File system activity
The DarkSide ransomware performs specific steps to encrypt a document, first appending a
unique file extension to the name of every targeted document type before encrypting the file.
The malware checks whether the Windows 10 user account under which it is running has
administrative privileges; If it does not, the malware attempts to elevate its privileges using
the CMSTPLUA technique.
DarkSide retrieves the target computer’s network adapter MAC address, and then computes
CRC32 five times on the first six bytes of the adapters’ MAC address, where the initial seed
is 0xDEADBEEF. Because the first six bytes of a MAC address are registered to

manufacturers, many of the affected corporate machines would end up with the same file
extension appended to documents simply as a result of the machines being part of a bulk
purchase.
The attackers (likely the same affiliates involved in the initial access) also make an effort to
terminate software that, if it was running, might otherwise interfere with the encryption
process. We’ve observed them terminate the services relating to enterprise backup software
from Commvault and Veeam, shut down the mail server software MailEnable, and kill SQL
server database services, so they can encrypt any database they find. They also attempt to
uninstall or tamper with Sophos services if they’re present on the machine. Like other
ransomware, DarkSide also deletes Volume Shadow Copies, which could help recover some
of the encrypted data if left unmolested.
Encrypting every document file type on a hard drive takes time, and if the process gets
interrupted mid-way through, some of the unencrypted files could be recovered easily.
Renaming the file with a new extension before encrypting it gives an attacker the ability to
make it appear as though everything has been encrypted, as the file extension change cuts
the ties between the document file type and its associated application.
The encryption process for DarkSide always has followed these steps:

Solving the ugly icon problem
There are several benefits to the threat actors when ransomware appends a new or unusual
file extension to the files it encrypts. Of course, it decouples the encrypted documents from
their normally associated applications, which means the user can’t interact with them in the
usual way (by double-clicking). The unusual file suffixes represent both a signal to the
ransomware that a file has already been encrypted (so the ransomware engine doesn’t reencrypt or double-encrypt the same files), and carry a side benefit: it prevents other
ransomware (at least, the families that target the documents they will attack using hardcoded
lists of file suffixes—a lot of them) from encrypting those same files.
One downside to switching the file suffix is that, when it loses its association with its
application, the document no longer uses the icon tied to that association. So an encrypted
Word document, for instance, just has a blank icon rather than a pretty picture of a document
with a W on it.
DarkSide appears to be very concerned with this problem of the poor appearance of
encrypted hard drives, so they have worked out a solution.

Encrypted documents typically

receive a new file extension and are consequently no longer associated with the document’s
productivity application
DarkSide drops an image file — an icon — into the %APPDATA%\Local directory, named
after the same eight character extension the ransomware has used to rename every targeted
file. In this example, that extension is .c0d2f38a. It then writes out a Windows Registry key in
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT that associates files with the unique and peculiar file extension it
has generated to that icon file, so that encrypted files suddenly have a unique icon of their
very own.

Registering the ransomware file type extension …

…

and referencing it to the icon file
DarkSide’s .ico file is so thorough that it contains several icon sizes, so your computer will
display the appropriately sized icon according to your preferences. It comes in 64×64,
32×32, 24×24, and 16×16 pixels, and it looks like a black padlock.

So what happens is that a folder full of documents goes from looking like this:

Pictures not yet attacked by DarkSide ransomware.

…to looking like a folder full of “locked” files, like this:

Pictures encrypted by DarkSide with the lock icon.

After the encryption is complete
After the ransomware has concluded the file encryption, it drops this ransom note in each
folder that contains the newly scrambled files:

The ransom note, redacted.
The link takes the victim to the payment page, hosted on the dark web:

The ransom demand gives the target a handy conversion of the ransom demand into both
Bitcoin and Monero (Dogecoin not currently accepted for payment), a countdown lock to
when the ransom demand doubles, and a link to the page that hosts examples of “Your data
stealed.”

Attacking Linux, encrypting VMDK files
The DarkSide ransomware adversary not only attacks Windows machines, but also deploys
ELF binaries (Executable and Link Format) to attack data on Linux machines. The Linux
version of the DarkSide ransomware specifically targets VMDK files, which are virtual hard
disk drives to be used in virtual machines like VMware and VirtualBox.
Console output of the Linux version reveals this ransomware is specifically searching for file
extensions associated with virtual hard disk drives on Linux, including on hypervisor
operating systems like VMWare’s ESX, where the virtual hard drives for virtual machines are
stored under the /vmfs/volumes/ file path:

Turning away from the DarkSide
Sophos defends against DarkSide in multiple ways. There are behavioral and dynamic
protections, which include the CryptoGuard feature in Intercept X, and both conventional
endpoint detections for Windows (Troj/Ransom-GAZ, Troj/PShl-E, VBS/Agent-BGYV) and
Linux (Linux/Ransm-J) malicious executables, and next-gen detections for in-memory
functions (Mem/DarkSide-A, HPmal/DarkS-A) and behaviors (AMSI/Inject-H,
AMSI/PSRans-A, ML/PE-A) on Windows.
