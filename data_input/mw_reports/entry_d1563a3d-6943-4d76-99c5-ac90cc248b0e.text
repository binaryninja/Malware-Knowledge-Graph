Kaspersky today revealed it found a vulnerability in Yanluowang ransomware's encryption
algorithm, which makes it possible to recover files it encrypts.
The Russian cybersecurity firm has added support for decrypting files locked by the
Yanluowang ransomware strain to its RannohDecryptor utility.
"Kaspersky experts have analyzed the ransomware and found a vulnerability that allows
decrypting files of affected users via a known-plaintext attack," the company said today.
This ransomware strain encrypts files bigger than 3GB and those smaller than 3GB using
different methods: larger ones are partially encrypted in 5MB stripes after every 200MB,
while smaller ones are entirely encrypted from start to end.

Because of this, "if the original file is larger than 3 GB, it is possible to decrypt all files on the
infected system, both big and small. But if there is an original file smaller than 3 GB, then
only small files can be decrypted."
To decrypt your files, you need at least one of the original files:
To decrypt small files (less than or equal to 3 GB), you need a pair of files with a size
of 1024 bytes or more. This is enough to decrypt all other small files.
To decrypt big files (more than 3 GB), you need a pair of files (encrypted and original)
no less than 3 GB in size each. This will be enough to decrypt both big and small files.
To decrypt files encrypted by Yanluowang ransomware, you have to use the Rannoh
decryption tool available for download from Kaspersky's servers.

Yanluowang attacks high-profile enterprise targets
Yanluowang ransomware, first spotted in October 2021, has been used in human-operated,
highly targeted attacks against enterprise entities.
One month later, one of its affiliates was observed attacking US organizations in the
financial sector since at least August, using the BazarLoader malware for reconnaissance.
Based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in these attacks, this
Yanluowang affiliate was linked to the Thieflock ransomware operation developed by the
Fivehands group (tracked by Mandiant as UNC2447).
Once deployed on compromised networks, Yanluowang stops hypervisor virtual machines,
ends all processes, and encrypts files appending the .yanluowang extension.

It also drops ransom notes named README.txt that warn victims not to contact law
enforcement or ask any ransomware negotiation firms for help.
If the attackers' requests are not met, the ransomware operators threaten to launch
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the victims' networks and inform their
employees and business partners they were breached.
They also say they'll breach the victims' networks again "in a few weeks" and delete their
data, a common tactic ransomware gangs use to pressure their victims into paying the
ransom.
