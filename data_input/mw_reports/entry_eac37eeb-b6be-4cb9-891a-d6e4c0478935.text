blog.redteam.pl/2020/05/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware.html

We secured forensics evidence data in the form of disk images of VPS servers used by
cybercriminals behind Sodinokibi / REvil ransomware (we also found Maze ransomware
there):

In this short post we would like to share information about their TTPs / tools with the
community.
As an initial point of entrance attackers are exploiting Pulse Secure VPN vulnerability
[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510].
On beforementioned VPS servers that were used to connect to the victims we found
following tools:
ADRecon [https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon],
CrackMapExec [https://github.com/maaaaz/CrackMapExecWin],
ghost [https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost],
impacket secretsdump [https://github.com/maaaaz/impacket-exampleswindows/blob/master/secretsdump.exe],
mimikatz [https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz],
PentestBox with Metasploit [https://pentestbox.org],
plink.exe [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html],
PowerSploit [https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit],
Proxifier [https://www.proxifier.com],
PsTools (PsExec)
URLs are collected from web browser history installed on the VPS machine.
They are also using two executables Eventlog-v6-fw3.exe (.NET 3) and Eventlog-v6-fw4.exe
(.NET 4) that are transferred to the victim machines to view users login history (thx mak).
