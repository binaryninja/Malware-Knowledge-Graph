CALLISTO GROUP

TLP: White

SUMMARY
The Callisto Group is an advanced threat actor whose known targets include military personnel,
government officials, think tanks, and journalists in Europe and the South Caucasus. Their primary interest
appears to be gathering intelligence related to foreign and security policy in the Eastern Europe and South
Caucasus regions.
In October 2015 the Callisto Group targeted a handful of individuals with phishing emails that attempted to
obtain the target’s webmail credentials.
In early 2016 the Callisto Group began sending highly targeted spear phishing emails with malicious
attachments that contained, as their final payload, the “Scout” malware tool from the HackingTeam RCS
Galileo platform.
These spear phishing emails were crafted to appear highly convincing, including being sent from
legitimate email accounts suspected to have been previously compromised by the Callisto Group via
credential phishing.
The Callisto Group has been active at least since late 2015 and continues to be so, including continuing to
set up new phishing infrastructure every week.

INTELLIGENCE
INTRODUCTION
The Callisto Group is an advanced threat actor that, as far as we know, has never
been identified. The primary focus of the Callisto Group appears to be intelligence
gathering related to European foreign and security policy.
This report focuses on describing activity dating from late 2015 to the present day
that we have been able to definitively associate with the Callisto Group. Also, some
indications of loosely linked activity dating back to at least 2013 is provided in the
section “Related activity” (page 3). However, we do not currently attribute this older
activity directly to the Callisto Group.

ATTACK OVERVIEW
PHASE 1: CREDENTIAL PHISHING
In October 2015, the Callisto Group was observed sending targeted credential
phishing emails with the subject “Remove account [target’s Gmail address]”. These
emails purported to come from Google alerting the target that their Gmail account
was about to be removed. The emails requested the target to click a link to prevent
their account from being removed. If clicked, this link would lead to a phishing
website that attempts to harvest the target’s Gmail credentials.
The emails were designed to appear authentic and convincing. The domains used
Google or commonly known Google services in both the referenced links and the
sender’s email.
Based on our information, these emails were highly targeted and were only sent to
a handful of targets. At least some of the recipient Gmail addresses were personal
accounts of the target and not readily available to the public, suggesting thorough
reconnaissance by the attackers.
Known targets include European military personnel. We also have reason to believe
this or related phishing incidents targeted key personnel in European think tanks.

PHASE 2: SPEAR PHISHING WITH MALICIOUS ATTACHMENTS
In early 2016, the Callisto Group was observed sending targeted spear phishing
emails containing malicious attachments. These emails were sent from email
accounts of individuals likely to be familiar to the recipient. We believe these email
accounts were compromised in the previous phase of the attack, or in similar
related phishing attacks.
Known spear phishing emails made reference to a conference with relevance to
European security policy. The malicious attachments purported to be invitations
or drafts of the agenda for the conference. The compromised email accounts used
to send the spear phishing emails belonged to individuals involved in organizing
the conference. Combining this information together resulted in highly convincing
spear phishing.
Known targets of these spear phishing emails with malicious attachments include
military personnel, government officials, think tanks, and journalists in Europe and
the South Caucasus. We are currently not aware of any evidence suggesting any of
these individuals were compromised, just that they were targeted.
All known malicious attachments sent with these spear phishing emails were
Microsoft Word .docx files. None of the known files exploited any vulnerabilities.
Rather, the files utilize a feature of Microsoft Word that allows “objects” to be
embedded in docx files. In the case of these malicious files, the embedded object is
the malware executable.

IMAGE 3
Warning prompt shown to the user by recent versions of Microsoft Word

The malware will only be executed if the user clicks “OK”.

For the embedded malware to be executed, a user needs to click an icon in the
docx file (see Images 1 and 2 for examples). Additionally, in recent versions of
Microsoft Word, if a user clicks the icon for the embedded executable, Word will
prompt the user with a warning (see Image 3). The payload will only be executed
if the user acknowledges the prompt.

MALWARE USAGE
In all known malicious attachments, the final payload was a variant of the “Scout”
tool from the HackingTeam Remote Control System (RCS) Galileo hacking
platform. HackingTeam is an Italian software company that created RCS, which
they describe as “the hacking suite for governmental interception”.1 In July 2015,
news emerged that HackingTeam had been breached. One of the consequences
of this incident was the then latest version of RCS Galileo being leaked to the
public.2
As a result of the leak, both the source code and the ready-made installers for
the RCS platform were made available for anyone to use. Based on our analysis
of Callisto Group’s usage of RCS Galileo, we believe the Callisto Group did not
utilize the leaked RCS Galileo source code, but rather used the leaked readymade installers to set up their own installation of the RCS Galileo platform. The
process for using the leaked installers to set up an RCS Galileo installation has
been described online in publicly available blogposts, making the process trivial
to achieve.
In the known spear phishing attacks by the Callisto Group, they employed the
“Scout” malware tool from the RCS Galileo platform. The “Scout” malware tool is
a light backdoor intended to be used as an initial reconnaissance tool to gather
basic system information and screenshots from a compromised computer, as
well as enable the installation of additional malware.

CONSEQUENCES
If a target of the credential phishing described in “Phase 1: credential phishing” clicked a link in the
email and proceeded to input their email credentials on the resulting phishing website, this would
provide the Callisto Group with the target’s email credentials. Unless the target was using twofactor-authentication, the Callisto Group would then have full access to the target’s email account.
We are confident the Callisto Group used this type of access to a target’s email account for the
purposes of sending spear phishing to other targets. We also believe it is highly likely that the
Callisto Group would leverage the same access to read and monitor the target’s email activity.
If a target of the spear phishing described in “Phase 2: malware deployment” opened the email
attachment and, crucially, clicked on the icon in the attachment, this would lead to the target’s
computer becoming infected with the “Scout” malware tool from the RCS Galileo platform. This
malware tool would have gathered basic information on the target’s computer and delivered these
to the Callisto Group. This malware tool would have also enabled the Callisto Group to install
additional malware on the target’s computer.
In effect, this would have provided the Callisto Group with full remote access to the target’s
computer, and by extension, to any data accessible to the target via their computer.

TARGETING AND ATTRIBUTION
The most obvious common theme between all known targets of the Callisto Group is an
involvement in European foreign and security policy, whether as a military or government official,
being employed by a think tank, or working as a journalist. More specifically, many of the known
targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the
South Caucasus.
This targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign
and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that
would suggest a financial motive.
It is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated
with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances.
While we don’t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the
existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.
While the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s activity is a
nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to
infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal
element. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure
contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure,
and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.
It is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For
example, a cyber crime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit
of a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to
make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the
currently available information.

CONTINUING ACTIVITY
The Callisto Group continues to be active. While they have been last known to employ malware in
February 2016, they continue setting up new phishing infrastructure every week.
Should the Callisto Group be alerted to the fact that they have been noticed, we do not know
how they will react. They may stop everything or they may continue as if nothing has happened.
However, as long as they believe they are succeeding in staying unnoticed, we believe it is highly
likely that they will continue their phishing activity, and follow up any successful compromises with
additional malware attacks.

IDENTIFICATION, MITIGATION, AND REMEDIATION
IDENTIFYING CALLISTO GROUP ACTIVITY
Appendix A provides indicators of compromise that can be used to attempt to identify Callisto
Group activity. Every effort has been made to thoroughly document the tools, techniques, and
procedures of the Callisto Group, as well as possible methods of identifying whether an individual
or organization has been targeted or compromised by this threat actor. However, it is possible
that the Callisto Group is also using other tools, techniques, and/or procedures that would evade
identification by the provided methods.
It is highly encouraged that any, even slight, suspicion of compromise be thoroughly investigated.

MITIGATION AGAINST CREDENTIAL PHISHING
Using two-factor authentication for accessing
email would prevent the attackers from using
compromised credentials to gain access to a target’s
email account. However, the compromise of login
credentials, especially should the victim not employ
proper password hygiene (such as by reusing
passwords), is a security risk in itself.

REMEDIATION AGAINST CREDENTIAL
PHISHING
Should a user suspect having fallen victim to
credential phishing, immediate remediating
action should be taken to reset the suspected
compromised credentials and enable two-factor
authentication. Any other services where the
user may have reused the same username and/or
password should also have the credentials reset.
These immediate actions should be followed by a
thorough investigation to determine the extent
of the possible compromise, to understand what
data may have been compromised, what actions
the attackers may have taken with the help of the
compromised credentials, and what the implications
of these actions and compromise may be.

MITIGATION AGAINST SPEAR PHISHING AND
RCS GALILEO
The spear phishing emails used in the known attacks
by the Callisto Group were so convincing that even
skilled and alert users would likely have attempted
to open the malicious attachment. However, simply
viewing the attachment would not have resulted
in an infection as the document did not attempt to
exploit any vulnerabilities.
Actual infection would have required the user
to attempt to click a specific icon in the opened
attachment. Furthermore, at least recent versions
of Microsoft Word will prompt the user with an
additional warning stating that what the user is about
to do is dangerous. For the infection to succeed, the
user would either have to acknowledge the prompt
or be using an old enough version of Microsoft Word
to not be warned.
Additionally, the malware payload used, RCS Galileo,
is relatively well known. Therefore, most antivirus
solutions provide good protection against RCS
Galileo and would have blocked the execution of
the malware payload. Using an up-to-date antivirus
solution with all protection features enabled is the
most effective mitigation against highly targeted
attacks such as these.

REMEDIATION AGAINST RCS GALILEO
Should a user suspect having become infected with
RCS Galileo, their computer should immediately
be disconnected from the internet. However, care
should be taken to not power off the computer as
this would hinder the ensuing investigation into the
compromise.
Once the computer has been disconnected from the
internet, the malware will be unable to communicate
with its command and control server, thereby
disrupting the attacker’s ability to control the
computer. This should immediately be followed by
initiating a thorough forensic investigation into the
compromise.
Should the affected organization or individual not
have complete confidence in their ability to properly
perform such an investigation, they should employ
outside assistance.
