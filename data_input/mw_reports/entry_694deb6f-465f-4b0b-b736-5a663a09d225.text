THE XDEDIC MARKETPLACE
Version: 1.0 (15 June 2016)
Distribution: this document is WHITE. For more information on TLP,
please see https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp

Executive summary
Over last two years a new kind of underground market has flourished, and xDedic is a perfect example.
“xDedic” is a trading platform where cybercriminals can purchase any of over 70,000 hacked servers
from all around the internet. It appears to be run by a Russian-speaking group of hackers.
The forum provides members with tools to patch RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) servers to support
multiple user logins, as well as other hacking tools, such as proxy installers and sysinfo collectors. The
main goal of the xDedic forum is to facilitate the buying and selling of credentials for hacked servers
which are available through RDP.
From governmental networks to corporations, it is possible to find almost anything on xDedic for as little
as 6 USD per server. This one-time cost provides a malicious "customer" with access to all the data on
the server and endless other possibilities, such as using the access to launch further attacks.
To investigate xDedic, Kaspersky Lab teamed up with a European ISP. This research allowed us to collect
data about the victims and the way the marketplace operates.
This report in a nutshell:
 Description of the xDedic marketplace and its offering.
 Statistics about servers for sale and their profile.
 How the attackers get access to the servers.
 What tools and Trojans they install in the hacked servers.
 High profile victims with hacked servers on the market.
 Attribution of the administrators of the forum.

The Marketplace
The marketplace is located at the domain xdedic[.]biz and anyone can register to use it. New members
need to use their account within 72 hours of registration, otherwise the account is automatically
removed unless they pay a fee of 10 USD.

Figure 1. xDedic main login
During registration, the user is asked to provide either an e-mail address or a Jabber account. In the case
of Jabber-account based registration, a confirmation code is sent in order to validate the account.
We strongly advice not to register to the xDedic marketplace, as any activity in the marketplace might
be in dangerous or even illegal.
According to an analysis of the information available in the marketplace, the service was started some
time in 2014 and gained major popularity in the middle of 2015 when over 3,000 servers were added to
the marketplace. Since then many new offerings have been posted and re-posted on the forum.

Figure 2. Marketplace activity in number of new server offerings
Once logged into the forum, the user can access a Dashboard with general news as well as a page with a
list of servers available for purchase.

Figure 3. Servers purchase form
For each server, detailed information such as price, location, speed, anti-virus installed, etc. is provided.

Figure 4. Additional server details
The owners of xdedic[.]biz claim not to be related to the sellers of hacked server access, but only to
provide a secure trading platform for others. It is possible to see the seller´s nickname in the list of
available servers (see Figure 2).
As of May 2016, access to 70,624 dedicated servers worldwide was offered for sale.

Figure 5. Number of servers available

Detailed statistics of available servers
In March 2016, the sales inventory included access to 51,752 servers from 183 countries, located in
11,050 different subnets. There were 425 unique sellers on the marketplace.
In May 2016, we counted 70,624 servers from 416 unique sellers in 173 affected countries. This shows
that the database of users and servers is carefully maintained.

The RDP servers can be used by cybercriminals in many different ways. That´s why the marketplace tags
the RDP servers that have been proven, through specific testing, not to have been blacklisted by certain
online resources. The owners of xDedic owners have developed a tool that can automatically collect
information about the system, including websites that are available from it, any software installed and
so on.

In addition to the lists of public websites and common software, there is specific link to software that
could be used as a source of fraudulent money. While the criminals sometimes install additional
software in the controlled system (for newly created users only) the list of software below was preinstalled by the legitimate owner of the system. In the case of some proxifiers or mass-email sending
software, these pre-installed features can be leveraged by the criminals to send out spam or use proxy
software without arousing suspicion.
There is a strong interest in accounting, tax reporting and point-of -sale (PoS) software which apparently
opens up many opportunities for fraudsters.

The xDedic validator tool
There is a separate portal for the so-called “partners” of the xDedic forum. These are essentially the
sellers who are offering the hacked servers on the market. The partners’ portal is password-protected
and can be found at “partner.xdedic[.]biz”:

Figure 10. xDedic partners portal

The partner’s portal has a different set of tools available for download. From these, the most interesting
is “SysScan”. “SysScan” is a validator tool used by xDedic partners to profile servers which are to be
made available for sale on the main forum.
We were able to find several versions of “SysScan”, listed below by their MD5s:

F661b50d45400e7052a2427919e2f777

The “SysScan” tool connects to a C&C server in order to report information about the system once it is
executed. The information reported includes:
 Server_ID, Username
 Windows version
 System Language
 if system is 64 bits or not
 size of installed memory
 CPU type
 if ports 25 and 80 are open
 if the system is virtual or physical
 what type of VM software is used
 Antivirus software, if any
Then it checks the server´s upload and download speeds using a set of speed-check scripts.
Finally, it checks what kind of software is installed in the system (see the list of available software
above).

Figure 11. Example of software information gathered

After gathering all this information, the SysScan tool encrypts it with AES using a hardcoded derived
password (- k8iJGx3oGo) and posts the data to the C&C in the /manual_result path.
This tool also checks if the RDP service is available and patches it if needed. It also adds the following
modifications to the Windows registry:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v
UserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD /d
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer\WinStations\RDPTcp" /v UserAuhentication /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f& reg delete
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v
legalnoticecaption /f& reg delete
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v
legalnoticetext /f

The following is a list of all the known C&Cs that Syscan uses to send its results:

Interestingly, the C&C server at 191.101.31[.]126 has a very specific banner on port 8189:

Hacking the servers
When we started our investigation, the assumption was that xDedic partners use brute-forcing attacks
in order to get access to the servers they control. On a machine where the xDedic validator tool
(sysscan.exe) was detected, we also found tools that specialized in performing brute-force attacks
against RDP servers, such as DUBrute and XPC (detected as Hacktool.Win32.Bruteforce). Later, we were
able to confirm this hypothesis with one of the victims.

The SCCLIENT Trojan
Thanks to a partner in our investigation, we were able to analyse a server that had been hacked and put
up for sale on the xDedic market. This section provides some information about the very interesting
malware found on it.
Once the server was compromised by the attackers through RDP password brute-forcing, they installed
a custom piece of malware in the path “/Windows/System32/scclient.exe” and registered it as a service
that would start automatically upon system boot. Interestingly, the attackers also installed bitcoinmining software, to use the idle time while they waited for a buyer for the server.
This SCClient Trojan connects to one of eight C&C servers:

We were able to sinkhole five of them, which allowed us to collect information about other hacked
servers running the same malware. During the first 12 hours, we received connections from over 3600
unique IPs.

Figure 13. Victim servers hitting our sinkhole during the first 12 hours
We were able to identify some high profile victims such as Governmental entities and universities.
During the investigation, we worked with several partners which allowed us to notify some of the
victims about the infections in their networks.

xDedic Socks System tool
In one of the topics opened by the xDedic team in the forum vor[.]ac, another piece of software was
introduced. They call it the xDedic Socks System:

Figure 14. xDedic Socks System tool
This is actually a wrapper for a popular proxy tool known as “3proxy tiny proxy”. The xDedic Socks
System can install the 3proxy tool in the system with the click of a button.

The tool basically opens the chosen ports (by default 8975 for SOCKS and 8795 for HTTPS) on the
infected server, turning it into a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy, with or without password-protection.
The tool could be run as a service. In order to do that, it simply drops an instance of 3proxy as
\AppData\Local\Temp\pxsrvc\pxsrvc.exe and runs it with “shell execute” as a process or service, with
portnames set by the user via GUI.

xDedic RDP Client
The xDedic team also developed their own RDP Client for Windows:

Figure 15. xDedic RDP client
According to them:
“xDedic RDP Client is primarily designed to make life easier for our customers. Copying ip, login,
password into a rdp conection window takes long time. Now just go to your purchase history, and click
"Copy" on the contrary the server to which you want to log in. Then switch to program, press the button
"Paste", information about RDP will be inserted into the fields, then simply press a Connect button.”

xDedic tools: KSN statistics
We were able to get statistical information about the geographical distribution of all the xDedic tools
described above from Kaspersky Security Network.
The first chart provides the geographical distribution based on all detections:

Figure 16. xDedic detections, geographical distribution
The second chart provides geographical detection for servers:

Figure 17. xDedic server detections, geographical distribution

The final chart provides geographical detection based on desktop detections:

Figure 18. xDedic desktop detections, geographical distribution
As can be seen above, there are more detections on desktop users than on servers, as antivirus is much
more popular on desktops.
Detections of xDedic tools on servers prevail in three regions: Europe, US and Middle East. In total we
found these tools on servers from more than 50 different countries.
Desktop detection statistics are very interesting in two countries: Russia and Ukraine. This supports the
theory that this service was initially founded by Russian-speaking people.
Kaspersky Labs products detect this set of tools as Hacktool.Win32.Rpdpatch.gen

The service also provides a Jabber server for support, running on xdedic[.]tk (87.236.215[.]18).
This server (87.236.215[.]18) is known for spreading malware in the past.
The previous email at e-investhost[.]com was also used to register other domains, such as
Xdedic[.]biz, viagra-purchase[.]org, wertor[.]info, omerta[.]cc, pharmaplus[.]biz, qualitypillsnorx[.]com.
The person behind them uses different Russian addresses and telephone numbers.

Wertor[.]info (scam website) and viagra-purchase[.]org domain information provide a different name:
Alex Pilsner.

Pivoting on this new name, we find a new interesting domain:

Figure 19. Omerta[.]cc – A carders forum

With the new Omerta email address we find yet more new domains and a new alias (Chi Cha):

Regarding the domain used in the original registration email, the website “E-Investhost[.]com” is a wellknown bullet-proof hosting site for Russian cybercriminals. An excerpt from the website description
(translated from Russian):
“BulletProof Hosting - for hyip, surf, warez, adult websites DDOS Protection (DDOS protection). Protect
your site, coordinate already under DDOS attack! We register Abuse-resistant domains (blocking
probability is minimal)”.

Conclusion
The existence of shady forums dedicated to cybercrime is old news. However, it is interesting to see how
the main focus of cybercriminals has changed over the last few years, the high degree of specialization
achieved by the administrators of the forums and what the relevance of such services might be in the
era of APTs.
We will start with the last point. The vast amount of servers for sale on the xDedic marketplace offers a
very likely alternative for APT actors with low resources, willing to fly under the radar or having
difficulties in getting a foothold in any of its victims. 8 USD is a very cheap price to pay for full access to
potential high profile targets. Usually overlooked, servers that have been hacked using brute-force
methods might present an opportunity for APT actors that doesn’t arouse suspicion.
Other than the implications for APTs, the marketplace´s statistics show a consistent number of servers
available for sale in very different locations. The tagging system makes it easy for opportunistic attackers
to find new targets according to their needs, and the bitcoin mining might be a nice side-line for the
criminals.
All in all, not only can this successful model be easily replicated, but we expect to see even more
specialized marketplaces appear where APT-as-a-service becomes a reality.
