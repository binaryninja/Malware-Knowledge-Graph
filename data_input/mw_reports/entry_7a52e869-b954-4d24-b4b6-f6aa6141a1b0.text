Executive Summary ­
As organizations implement additional security controls and detections, threat actors adjust to bypass them. Since our initial investigation into a
Lorenz ransomware intrusion that exploited a Mitel MiVoice VoIP appliance, we have observed a shift in the group’s Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs).
The Arctic Wolf Labs team recently investigated additional Lorenz ransomware intrusions, which also exploited a Mitel MiVoice VoIP appliance
vulnerability (CVE-2022-29499) for initial access. In at least one case in late-2022, we observed the threat actors leveraging a compromised
VPN account to regain access to the victim’s environment and execute Magnet RAM Capture—a free tool that is typically used by law
enforcement and forensic teams to capture the physical memory of a victim’s device—on a Mitel Digital Voicemail system (running Microsoft
Windows Server 2016). The threat actors leveraged Magnet RAM Capture to bypass the victim’s EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response).
Arctic Wolf Labs has informed Magnet Forensics about the known abuse of their tool by the Lorenz group.
We have published a compiled list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and related artifacts we observed in this intrusion to our GitHub here.
Also included in our GitHub are Sigma and YARA rules that our team developed to assist defenders in detecting unexpected use of Magnet
RAM capture on their hosts.
Note: Arctic Wolf Labs has deployed detections in our platform to identify potential malicious activity associated with the Lorenz ransomware
group, including the TTPs mentioned in this blog.

Key Findings
The Lorenz ransomware group targeted the same victim and adapted their TTPs to successfully bypass security controls when the first
attempt was not successful.
This is the first Lorenz ransomware intrusion publicly documented where the threat actors leveraged Magnet RAM Capture to dump
memory.

Substantive Analysis
In at least one intrusion, the Lorenz ransomware group was not able to start the encryption process due to their registry modification attempts
and PowerShell commands being blocked by the EDR. The techniques and procedures in this intrusion were almost identical to the Lorenz
ransomware case we investigated in September 2022.
We observed the use of the Chisel tunneling tool, dumping of LSASS, and encryption attempts via BitLocker Drive Encryption. Notably, data
exfiltration did not occur until the threat actors noticed their PowerShell commands were being prevented by security controls. Approximately
two hours after unsuccessful data encryption, we observed the threat actors download and execute FileZilla on multiple systems to exfiltrate as
much data as possible. Like other Lorenz intrusions, the threat actors exfiltrated the data to Digital Ocean IP addresses.
However, data exfiltration and extortion were not enough for Lorenz, and approximately a month later, the threat actors leveraged
compromised VPN credentials to regain access. The compromised VPN credentials were tied to a vendor account used to service the Mitel
infrastructure, which were obtained via activity from the previous incident when the credentials had been reset but set to “User must change
password at next logon,” which prompted the threat actors to change the password when logging in via the vendor account.
Ultimately this access allowed Lorenz to pivot into the Mitel environment and set up Chisel as a SOCKS proxy as well as obtaining additional
credentials and creating accounts for persistence.

3/7

Operating within kernel mode gives an adversary access to the most privileged areas of an operating system. To obtain kernel-level privileges
threat actors often leverage a technique known as “Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver” (BYOVD). BYOVD allows a threat actor full kernel
memory read and write operations and gives them the ability to evade endpoint security solutions by removing telemetry sources. Multiple
threat actors have leveraged BYOVD to bypass and disable endpoint security solutions, including Lazarus, AvosLocker, and BlackByte.
Well-known vulnerable driver exploits are easily detected by most EDRs, forcing advanced threat actors to research kernel driver
vulnerabilities and develop exploits, which can be a time-consuming and tedious task.
Lorenz, however, did not use a vulnerability to gain kernel access; instead, they leveraged Magnet RAM Capture, a user-mode application
which comes equipped with a signed kernel driver, like many other RAM acquisition tools, to directly access the physical memory. The use of
Magnet RAM Capture allowed the threat actor to bypass the EDR on the victim host and enabled them to obtain a memory dump of the host.
Although a RAM capture is not completely structured, threat actors can extract sensitive information like credentials via readily available
memory forensics tools.

Example of obtaining credentials from RAM Capture

Conclusion
The Lorenz ransomware group consistently shows inventive ways to achieve their objectives. This added technique demonstrates how the
Lorenz threat actors are willing to adjust their TTPs to evade security controls. In this case, they relied on a known RAM Capture tool to bypass
an EDR solution.
Many security vendors provide free tools to help security professionals perform better research and security investigations. Even with access
controls, threat actors will continue to find ways to obtain and abuse legitimate tools to bypass security controls.

Recommendations
Ensure Secure Password Reset After a Compromise
When leveraging the “User must change password at next logon” ensure all accounts that received the prompt have successfully changed
their password and logged in; this includes user, service, and vendor accounts.
If not, threat actors could leverage previously compromised credentials to reset the password and obtain access again, negating the password
reset. Administrators should also understand all accounts tied to the service so that all resets can be tracked and recorded.
For user or vendor accounts that are tied to individuals outside of your organization, consider not using the “User must change password at
next logon” feature. Instead, reset the password directly with a new value and send the password to the account holder out of band. Ensure
the user resets the password upon logging in to the account.
Implement Multi-factor Authentication
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible within your environment, especially VPN accounts. Multi-factor authentication
reduces the impact leaked or compromised credentials have on an organization.
Conduct Network and Host Baselines to aid in Monitoring of Malicious Traffic and Binaries
Understanding your environment can help you identify malicious traffic and binaries in a more efficient manner. For example, if your
organization does not use Magnet RAM Capture for legitimate business purposes or there is no purpose for it to be present on a target system,
the use of the binary could potentially be a good indicator that malicious activity is present in your environment. Understanding your
environment’s baseline and approved software will ensure malicious activity is caught earlier in the kill chain.
Audit or Block Unwanted Drivers using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)
Organizations can consider auditing or blocking unwanted drivers via Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC). Microsoft has detailed
many methods of restricting unwanted drivers in their “Microsoft recommended driver block rules” article.

Hunting for Execution
Magnet RAM Capture requires admin privileges and can either be executed via GUI or the command line.
Both types of execution can be identified by leveraging PE header metadata for process execution events, as these details have been defined
by Magnet Forensics and have been consistent over various identified versions of the tool.
Example Process Create Event
Process Create:
Description: Magnet RAM Capture
Product: Magnet RAM Capture
Company: Magnet Forensics Inc.
OriginalFileName: MRC.exe

If execution is done via the command line, defenders can monitor for Magnet RAM Capture parameter invocations.
Parameter

Description

/accepteula*

Accepts the EULA (no user interaction required)

/go*

<optional output path, including output file name> – No user input required; start RAM capture immediately, saving to a .raw
file in the current folder unless a path is provided (if the path contains spaces, use quotes around the entire path).

/split

500MB|1GB|2GB|4GB – Split the RAM capture into segments of 500MB, 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB (e.g. /split 2GB) – requires /go
parameter.

/silent*

Captures RAM in the background; no interface or progress displayed – requires /go parameter.
