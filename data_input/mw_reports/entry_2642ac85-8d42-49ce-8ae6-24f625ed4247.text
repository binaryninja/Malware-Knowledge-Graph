Introduction
• Investigation started from an Xnote sample connected to Operation
DRBControl’s domain name
• …found more samples, and different malware families
• …noticed other platforms being targeted
• …figured out some targets
• …found some infection vectors
• …etc etc
• This talk is the result of this investigation

Infection vector – XSS and fake installer
• Persistent cross-site scripting in legitimate website to load a
Javascript script from a third-party server

• The script does some checks and displays a message stating
that the Flash player version is too old
• Then it calls Xss.php script, and redirects to a website linking
a malicious installer
10

Infection vector – XSS and fake installer
• Xss.php script probably collects some statistics about the
victims
• Malicious installer’s website is in Chinese language

11

Infection vector – XSS and fake installer
• Server hosting JS and PHP script also hosts a login page

• “Xss平台” (Xss píng tái) means “XSS platform”
• Message mentions XSS results and free online XSS platforms
12

implementation
• PuppetDownloader, C++ malware downloading second stage

Malware toolkit – PuppetLoader
• Stage 1 – Stealthy Loader
• Starts loading a legitimate DLL from Windows\System32 directory
• Replace it with malicious code on the fly
• Hook NTDLL’s:
• NtQueryAttributesFile, NtOpenFile, NtCreateSection, NtMapViewOfSection,
NtQuerySection and ZwClose

• Use undocumented ntdll’s APIs – RtlPushFrame, RtlPopFrame and
RtlGetFrame to avoid recursive hooking problem

Malware toolkit – PuppetLoader
• ‘LDFM’ frame

• Base address of malicious payload; buffer size; SizeOfImage;
file name lz32.dll; file name asycfilt.dll; handle to open
lz32.dll

LdrLoadDll asycfilt.dll
NtOpenFile: if asycfilt.dll is being open, then replace it with lz32.dll
NtCreateSection: if FileHandle matches to previously opened lz32.dll, then fix
section’s MaximumSize to correspond the size of the malicious payload
NtMapViewOfSection: fix pViewSize to be the same as new SizeOfImage; copy
malicious payload
NtQuerySection: compute the difference between loaded and preferred
ImageBase; if not equal return STATUS_IMAGE_NOT_AT_BASE
LdrLoadDll rebases malicious payload, load all dependencies

36

Gateway (traffic forwarder)
Communication (tcp, stcp, sudp)
Runs local server, registers ‘routes’
Attacker directly connects
to the infected machine and
executes commands via GET/POST requests

Malware toolkit – Xnote/HelloBot
•
•
•
•

Malware families reported in 2015 and 2018
Not known to be used for espionage
Typical RAT features
Both families embed a XOR-encrypted configuration file
• Contain campaign identifiers/notes
• Some of them related to gambling

• Contain Chinese comments (HelloBot)

38

Malware toolkit – Xnote/HelloBot
• Command seen in multiple HelloBot configurations:
cmd0=“fuser -k /tmp/.wq4sMLArXw”
• Such command is run periodically by the malware’s monitoring process,
and it kills every process accessing “/tmp/.wq4sMLArXw” file
• “/tmp/.wq4sMLArXw” is a file created by Xnote malware to check if the
system is already infected

• Thus, HelloBot kills running Xnote instances
