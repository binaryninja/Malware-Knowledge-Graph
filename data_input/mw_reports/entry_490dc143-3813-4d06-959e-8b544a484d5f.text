Fidelis Threat Advisory #1013
RAT	  in	  a	  jar:	  A	  phishing	  campaign	  using	  Unrecom
May 21, 2014
Document Status:
1.0
Last Revised: 2014-05-21

Executive Summary
In the past two weeks, we have observed an increase in attack activity against the U.S. state and local
government, technology, advisory services, health, and financial sectors through phishing emails with
what appears to be a remote access trojan (RAT) known as Unrecom. The attack has also been observed
against the financial sector in Saudi Arabia and Russia.
1

As Unrecom is a comprehensive multi-platform Java-based remote access tool, currently not detected by
most AntiVirus products, it presents a risk to a large number of potential victims, regardless of operating
system. The following is a screenshot of the Unrecom RAT v.2.0 (Version in Spanish):

Over time, various reports in the community have documented the evolution of this tool. This evolution is
to be expected, but its low detection rate, recent use this month through phishing emails campaigns
against multiple sectors in the U.S. and association with past campaigns involving a variety of RATs
captured our attention. The evolution of Unrecom RAT dates from its beginnings as a tool known as
Frutas RAT, subsequently branded as Adwind RAT, and now Unrecom RAT.
In 2013, it was reported that Frutas RAT was used in phishing email campaigns against high profile
2
companies in Europe and Asia in sectors such as finance, mining, telecom, and government .

Unrecom RAT provides the attacker with full control over the compromised system, once infected. It has
some of the following capabilities:
-

Collection of System Information (e.g. IP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version,
Computer Name, User account compromised, etc.)
Upload & Execute additional malware, typically exploiting vulnerabilities derived from collected
system information
Capture Webcam and Microphone, without user notification
Remote Desktop to watch user activity
File Manager allowing access to files in the context of the current user
Browser Password theft
Keylogging to capture passwords otherwise obscured from viewing

In the past, variants of the DarkComet and AcromRAT malware have also been observed beaconing to
the same Command & Control (CnC) servers used by the Unrecom RAT in this campaign.
This document will provide information about the recent phishing campaigns observed with this RAT and
some of the network indicators.

Threat Overview
The increased threat activity against the U.S. state and local government, technology, advisory services,
and health sectors in the past two weeks is of great concern to us as it is being carried through phishing
emails with what appears to be a tool known as Unrecom RAT.
The phishing emails try to trick the users into thinking the emails are legitimate by attaching the RAT with
the some of the following names: Payment Invoice.jar, Payment details.jar,
POR#94586.zip/POR#94586.jar, INV#94586.zip/INV#94586.jar, Invitation.jar, reports-pdf.jar, US$25k.jar,
and DBC_BANK_IMG_23456_156.jar, and lremit_Transfer_Error_Page.jar.
Some of the email message subjects observed during this campaign are:

It appears that the latest version of this RAT is 3.2 and is being sold at “unrecom[.]net” for $500
(Enterprise Version) and $200 (Full Version).
We find it interesting that on their website, the authors of this software recommend Unrecom RAT buyers
to not scan created servers (malware deployed to Victim systems) at Virustotal nor Metascan. This is

indicative of the adaptive, counter-intelligence techniques being adopted as threat actors become aware
that many security researchers use these services to gather threat intelligence.

Significantly, malware objects seen in previous campaigns like DarkComet and ArcomRAT have also
been observed beaconing to the same CnC servers Unrecom RAT is currently using. DarkComet is
6,7
known to be a popular RAT used in threat activity in the Middle East .

Risk Assessment
A remote access tool provides an attacker with full control over the victim system. Once a system has
been compromised, the attacker may install one or more backdoors. These backdoors provide a
persistent foothold, using a separate command and control channel; allowing future access less likely to
be correlated to the original activity.
Through its modular plugin framework, this particular tool lets the attacker obtain System Information (e.g.
IP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version, Computer Name, User account compromised,
etc.), Upload & Execute additional malware, Capture Webcam, Remote Desktop, File Manager, Browser
Password Recovery, Capture Microphone, Keylogger, etc.

Further Analysis And Correlation
One simple example of how the emails in this phishing campaign are related is that the Command and
Control node (184.22.201[.]27) that the malware communicates with is shared by two separate phishing
emails in this campaign, as shown in the diagram below.
Beginning at the top of the diagram and working down, on the left side of the diagram are two phishing
emails, the details of which are referenced in the pages above as item numbers 2 & 3. Of note, these
phishing emails were sent to users at two separate and unrelated organizations. As you can see, when
compared to each other, these messages appear completely unrelated, other than the fact they both
contain jar files that are sophomorically “obfuscated” as pdf.jar files.
Note that both the subjects, “Transfer investigation report” and “Confirm transactions before release” are
comparatively unique as are the senders , "Police Department" cmmds@sbt.co[.]in and Arthur Anderson
alexanderharolds@arthurandersen[.]com. In addition to the fact that the emails share no attributes, the
malicious attachments are also unrelated.
Finally, and of most interest in this diagram, the central node at the bottom of the diagram, represents the
Command and Control node (184.22.201[.]27) used by these two examples. While this shared resource
is noteworthy, of particular interest is that it has also been used in other campaigns.

On the right side of the diagram are files used in two other campaigns using the ArcomRAT and
6,7
DarkComet , The fact that they share the same command-and-control infrastructure as the UnrecomRat
campaign make this central node all the more interesting.
