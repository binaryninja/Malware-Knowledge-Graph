Operation SpoofedScholars: A Conversation with TA453

2/9

July 13, 2021 Joshua Miller, Crista Giering, & the Threat Research Team

Key Takeaways
TA453, an Iranian-state aligned actor, masqueraded as British scholars to covertly target individuals
of intelligence interest to the Iranian government in what Proofpoint has dubbed
Operation SpoofedScholars.
The email conversations were benign until TA453 provided a link to a compromised website hosting
a credential harvesting page.
The use of a legitimate but actor-compromised website is an increase in sophistication compared to
TA453’s historical Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of using actor-controlled credential phishing
websites.
Proofpoint has worked with the appropriate authorities to conduct victim notification.

Overview
Masquerading as UK scholars with the University of London’s School of Oriental and African
Studies (SOAS), the threat actor TA453 has been covertly approaching individuals since at least January
2021 to solicit sensitive information. The threat actor, an APT who we assess with high confidence
supports Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence collection efforts, established
backstopping for their credential phishing infrastructure by compromising a legitimate site of a highly
regarded academic institution to deliver personalized credential harvesting pages disguised as
registration links. Identified targets included experts in Middle Eastern affairs from think tanks, senior
professors from well-known academic institutions, and journalists specializing in Middle Eastern
coverage.
These connection attempts were detailed and extensive, often including lengthy conversations prior to
presenting the next stage in the attack chain. Once the conversation was established, TA453 delivered a
“registration link” to a legitimate but compromised website belonging to the University of London’s SOAS
radio. The compromised site was configured to capture a variety of credentials. Of note, TA453 also
targeted the personal email accounts of at least one of their targets. In subsequent phishing emails,
TA453 shifted their tactics and began delivering the registration link earlier in their engagement with the
target without requiring extensive conversation. This operation, dubbed SpoofedScholars, represents one
of the more sophisticated TA453 campaigns identified by Proofpoint.

Chatting with TA453
In early 2021, a TA453 persona, “Dr.Hanns Bjoern Kendel, Senior Teaching and Research Fellow at
SOAS University in London,” used email address hannse.kendel4[@]gmail.com to solicit
conversations with targets. The following is a brief summary of an example conversation observed by
Proofpoint Threat Research:
TA453 sent an initial email trying to entice the target with a prospective invitation to an online conference
on “The US Security Challenges in the Middle East.” TA453 strived to connect with the individual via
phone to discuss the invitation; however, after the target hedged and emphatically stated that they
wanted a written proposal with the details, TA453 acquiesced with conference specifics. After a little back
and forth that verified the target’s interest, TA453 provided a detailed invitation to the fake conference
(Figure 1). The conversation concluded with TA453 attempting to get the target to connect
via videoconferencing.

Conversation Analysis
Throughout the conversation, Proofpoint identified a few interesting themes:

5/9

TA453 demonstrates passable English skills and is open to voice communication via
videoconferencing.
TA453 demonstrates an interest in mobile phone numbers, possibly for mobile malware or
additional phishing.
TA453 repeatedly demonstrated a desire to connect with the target in real-time.

Personal Targeting
In addition to Hanns’ solicitations, at least one target received a credential harvesting email to their
personal email account. This attempt did not masquerade as Dr. Kendel but did still attempt to harvest
credentials from the target. Currently, Proofpoint does not have more information on this specific kill
chain.

Campaign Breakdown
Targets
TA453 targets in Operation SpoofedScholars can be clustered into three main categories that are
consistent with the IRGC’s historical collection priorities.
Senior think tank personnel
Journalists focused on Middle Eastern affairs
Professors
These groupings consistently have information of interest to the Iranian government, including, but not
limited to, information about foreign policy, insights into Iranian dissident movements, and understanding
of U.S. nuclear negotiations, and most of the identified targets have been previously targeted by
TA453. Targeting appeared to be highly selective, with less than ten organizations targeted, according to
Proofpoint data.
Infrastructure
Once TA453 established a time for the target to activate their invitation, the TA453 persona provided the
personalized link to the intended victim. The link led to a “Webinar Control Panel” on a legitimate but
compromised website belonging to University of London’s SOAS, a research institution. According to
Proofpoint research, while TA453 does appear to have elevated privileges allowing them to create
credential harvesting pages at soasradio[.]org, other pages on the site continue to host legitimate SOASaffiliated content.
TA453 strengthened the credibility of the attempted credential harvest by utilizing personas masquerading
as legitimate affiliates of SOAS to deliver the malicious links. The displayed webpage (Figure 2) offers
users the ability to use “OpenID” to log in with the following mail providers; Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,
iCloud, Outlook, AOL, mail.ru, Email, and Facebook. The website
URI was hxxps://soasradio[.]org/connect/?memberemailid= [RedactedInitials of Target]-[String of
alphanumeric characters].

When a particular provider is clicked, a pop-up box (Figure 3) displays the actual credential phishing box.
Of the options, Google, Microsoft, and Email buttons prefilled the target’s email address. Based on the
variety of email providers along with TA453’s insistence that the target log on when TA453 was online,
Proofpoint assesses that TA453 was planning on immediately validating the captured credentials
manually.

Hanns Kendel was not the only SOAS scholar spoofed by
TA453 during Operation SpoofedScholars. Months later, TA453 began spoofing Tolga Sinmazdemir,
another individual associated with SOAS. These emails solicited contributions to a “DIPS
Conference” and would have likely followed a similar kill chain discussed above. In midMay, TA453 returned, using a different email (hanse.kendel4[@]gmail.com) to recruit for a webinar.

Attribution
As discussed previously in Proofpoint’s research on TA453’s BadBlood campaign, Proofpoint analysts
cannot independently confirm that TA453 is part of the IRGC. However, the tactics and techniques used
by the group and their overall targeting detected by Proofpoint is in line with IRGC intelligence collection
priorities, which gives us high confidence in our assessment that TA453 operates in support of the
IRGC. The IRGC, specifically the IRGC Intelligence Organization, collects intelligence and conducts
operations in support of a variety of assigned responsibilities. According to the Meir Amit Intelligence and
Terrorism Information Center’s November 2020 report, some of the IRGC IO’s responsibilities include
foiling political subversion, combating western cultural penetration, and supporting the arrest of Iranian
dual nationals.
Likewise, attribution specifically for Operation SpoofedScholars is based on TTP similarities to previous
TA453 campaigns and consistency with TA453’s historical targeting. TA453 often uses free email
providers to spoof individuals familiar to their targets to increase the likelihood of successful compromise.
Additionally, as previously discussed, TA453 concentrates their credential phishing to specific individuals
of interest to collect intelligence through exfiltration of sensitive email and contacts or initial access for
future phishing campaigns.
Mitigation
For specific mitigations against Operation SpoofedScholars, Proofpoint recommends investigating
network traffic to soasradio[.]org, specifically URIs starting with hxxps://soasradio[.]org/connect/?
memberemailid=. Additionally, emails
from hanse.kendel4[@]gmail.com, hannse.kendel4[@]gmail.com, and t.sinmazdemir32[@]gmail.com should
be considered suspect and investigated.
Broader mitigation efforts against TA453 campaigns include increased awareness and investigation of
unusual communication from professional contacts. Academics, journalists, and think
tank scholars should practice caution and verify the identity of the individuals offering them unique
opportunities, especially if those opportunities occur virtually. Using multifactor authentication provides
another layer of protection against TA453 credential harvesting.

Conclusion
TA453 illegally obtained access to a website belonging to a world class academic institution to leverage
the compromised infrastructure to harvest the credentials of their intended targets. The use of
legitimate, but compromised, infrastructure represents an increase in TA453’s sophistication and will
almost certainly be reflected in future campaigns. TA453 continues to iterate, innovate, and collect in
support of IRGC collection priorities. While some of the identified selectors no longer appear to be active
in TA453 operations, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA453 will continue to spoof
scholars around the world in support of TA453’s intelligence collection operations in support of Iranian
government interests. Academics, journalists, and think tank personnel should practice caution and verify
the identity of the individuals offering them unique opportunities.
