A "Naver"-ending game of Lazarus APT
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/naver-ending-game-lazarus-apt

Zscaler’s ThreatLabz research team has been closely monitoring a campaign targeting users
in South Korea. This threat actor has been active for more than a year and continues to
evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); we believe with high confidence that
the threat actor is associated with Lazarus Group, a sophisticated North Korean advanced
persistent threat (APT) group.
In 2021, the main attack vector used by this threat actor was credential phishing attacks
through emails, posing as Naver, the popular South Korean search engine and web portal.
In 2022, the same threat actor started spoofing various important entities in South Korea,
including KRNIC (Korea Internet Information Center), Korean security vendors such as
Ahnlab, cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, and others. Some details about this
campaign were published in this Korean blog, however they did not perform the threat
attribution.
Even though the TTPs of this threat actor evolved over time, there were critical parts of their
infrastructure that were reused, allowing ThreatLabz to correlate the attacks and do the
threat attribution with a high-confidence level. Our research led us to the discovery of
command-and-control (C2) domains even before they were used in active attacks by the
threat actor. This proactive discovery of attacker infrastructure helps us in preempting
the attacks.
In this blog, we will share the technical details of the attack chains, and will explain how we
correlated this threat actor to Lazarus.
We would like to thank Dropbox for their quick action in taking down the malicious
accounts used by the threat actor, and for also sharing valuable threat intelligence that
helped us with threat attribution.

Attack chains
This threat actor has frequently updated its attack chains over the last two months. We
identified three unique attack chains used by the threat actor to distribute the malware
in emails:
Figure 1: Attack flow

Spear phishing emails distribution
1/11

During our analysis, we discovered that at least one of the IP addresses (222.112.127[.]9)
used by the threat actor to log in to the attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts was also used
to send spear phishing emails to the victims in South Korea.
Below are examples of two such emails that were sent from the IP address 222.112.127[.]9.
Note: This IP address is related to KT Corporation, a Korean telecom provider. Multiple
IP addresses related to KT Corporation were abused by this threat actor during the current
attack.
Email #1
In this email, a macro-based document was sent to the victim.
Figure 2: Email sent to the victim
Figure 3 below shows that the decoy content of the document is related to Menlo
Security company. This is consistent with other decoy contents used by the threat actor. For
instance, in the document with MD5 hash: 1a536709554860fcc2c147374556205d, the decoy
content used was related to Ahnlab - a Korea-based computer security company. This is
done for the purpose of social engineering.

Email #2
In this email, a password protected macro-based XLS file was sent to the victim. The
password for the file was mentioned in the email body.
The theme of the file is related to cryptocurrency investments. This theme is consistent with
other documents sent in this campaign as well. Lazarus Group is known to have a keen
interest in attacking cryptocurrency users, asset managers, and companies.

Figure 5 below shows the sender's IP address in the email headers as indicated by the
X-Originating-IP field.

Threat attribution
In order to perform the threat actor attribution, we did a correlation of the below data points.
1. C2 IP addresses
2. Attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts’ registrant email addresses
2/11

3. C2 domains’ registrant email addresses
4. Passive DNS data
5. Sender's email address in credential phishing attacks
6. Sender's IP address in credential phishing attacks
Note: OSINT information related to the above data points was also used in correlation
analysis.

# Correlating different attacks to same threat actor
As described in the network communication section later in the blog, the Stage-3 binary
initially connects to an attacker-controlled Dropbox account to fetch a C2 domain which is
used to perform further network communication.
In collaboration with Dropbox, we were able to discover the email addresses associated with
the attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts used during this attack. One such email addresses
was: peterstewart0326@gmail[.]com
This same email address was recently mentioned in Prevailion's blog. It was linked to several
domains which were used during Naver-themed phishing activity.
Also, according to this blog from 2021, this same email address was also used to send Naverthemed credential phishing attack emails to users in South Korea.
Correlating the above data points, we can say with a high confidence level that the attack
chains we have described in this blog are also related to the same threat actor.

# Attribution to Lazarus APT
According to the threat infrastructure mapping done in Prevailion blog, the IP address
23.81.246[.]131 belongs to one of the critical nodes used by the threat actor during Naverthemed phishing activity. One of the domains linked to this IP address was
navercorpservice[.]com. If we check the passive DNS data for this domain, we find two
other IP address resolutions: 172.93.201[.]253 in November 2021 and 45.147.231[.]213
in September 2021.
The IP address 172.93.201[.]253 was recently used to host the domain disneycareers[.]net which was attributed to Lazarus APT in Google TAG blog.
Further, what caught our attention was the IP address 45.147.231[.]213. This IP address
was earlier used by North Korea-based APT threat actor. Recently, we also had a new domain
resolution alert for this IP address as part of our C2 infrastructure tracking. If we pivot on the

3/11

passive DNS data for this IP address, we can see that the domain:
www.devguardmap[.]org was hosted on this IP address in Jan 2021 which was attributed
to Lazarus APT as per this tweet from ESET and Google TAG blog.
Correlating all the above data points, we reached the conclusion that the attack-chains we
discovered are related to Lazarus threat actor. To the best of our knowledge, at the time of
writing, this threat actor attribution has not been publicly documented yet.

Technical analysis
For the purpose of technical analysis we will consider the attack chain starting with a
Compiled HTML file having MD5 210db61d1b11c1d233fd8a0645946074.

[+] Stage 1: Compiled HTML file
The CHM file contains a malicious binary embedded inside it. At runtime, this will be
dropped on the filesystem in the path: C:\\programdata\\chmtemp\\chmext.exe
and executed.
The code responsible for extracting, dropping and executing the binary is present inside
1hh.html as shown below.
Figure 6: HTML code dropping and executing the binary

[+] Stage 2: Dropper
The dropper on execution performs the following operations:
1. Detects sleep patching to identify controlled execution environment such as Sandbox
execution
2. Checks the name of all the running processes and terminates if it finds a process running
with the name "v3l4sp.exe". This process name corresponds to the security software
developed by Ahnlab (a popular and frequently used security vendor in South Korea).
3. Creates file in the path "C:\ProgramData\Intel\IntelRST.exe"
4. XOR decodes the embedded PE from a hardcoded address
5. Writes the decoded PE to the file created in Step-3
6. Modifies PEB to masquerade itself as explorer.exe
7. Executes IntelRST.exe
8. Creates RUN registry entry for persistence

4/11

Value: IntelCUI
Data: C:\ProgramData\Intel\IntelRST.exe

[+] Stage 3: Dropped binary
The file IntelRST.exe dropped by the Stage-2 dropper is an ASpacked binary. On execution it
performs the following operations:
1. Similar to the dropper binary it tries to detect sleep patching to identify controlled
execution environment
2. Collects machine information and stores using the specified format which is later
exfiltrated and used as machine identifier.
String format:
[decoded_string]_[username]_[volume_serial_number_post_8_bytes]
decoded_string: (encoded string) ^ (key) [encoded_string_byte_offset%keySize]
username: GetUserName()
volume_serial _number: Using DeviceIoControl with
IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY (0x2d1400)
3. Checks name of all the running processes and terminates if there is some process running
with the name "v3l4sp.exe" or "AYAgent.aye" or "IntelRST.exe"
4. If running with administrator privileges then it executes a PowerShell command using
cmd.exe to add WindowsDefender exclusion.
PowerShell command: Powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath
"C:\ProgramData\Intel\IntelRST.exe
5. Finally it starts the network communication

[+] Network communication
The network communication occurs in the following sequence:
1. Send a GET request to the URL
"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k288s9tu2o53v41/zs_url.txt?dl=0".
2. Query the file size and send another network request to read the file content.

5/11

Note: The file content points to the C2 domain to be used for rest of the network
communication.
3. Using the extracted C2 domain, send a POST request to the path "/post.php" and exfiltrate
collected user information.
Exfiltrated user information format:
uid={string_generated_in_Step-2_of_Stage3_binary}&avtype=%d&majorv=%d&minorv=%d
4. Finally send a GET request to the path "/{decoded_string_from_step-2_of_Stage3_binary}/{formated_string_from_step-2_of_Stage-3_binary}/fecommand.acm"
Note: At the time of analysis we didn't get any active response from the C2 server for the
above network request.
