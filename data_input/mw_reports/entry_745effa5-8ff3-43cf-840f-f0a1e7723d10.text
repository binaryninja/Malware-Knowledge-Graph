Cybercrime
The cyberattacks against the Ukrainian electric power industry continue. Background
information on this story can be found in our recent publications:
Yesterday (January 19th) we discovered a new wave of these attacks, where a number of
electricity distribution companies in Ukraine were targeted again following the power outages
in December. What’s particularly interesting is that the malware that was used this time is not
BlackEnergy, which poses further questions about the perpetrators behind the ongoing
operation. The malware is based on a freely-available open-source backdoor – something no
one would expect from an alleged state-sponsored malware operator.

Details of the cyberattacks
1/5

The attack scenario itself hasn’t changed much from what we described in our previous blog
post. The attackers sent spearphishing emails to potential victims yesterday. The email
contained an attachment with a malicious XLS file.

Spearphishing email from January 19, 2016

The email contains HTML content with a link to a .PNG file located on a remote server so that
the attackers will get a notification that the email was delivered and opened by the target. We
have observed the same interesting technique used by the BlackEnergy group in the past.

Just as interestingly, the name of PNG file is the base64-encoded string “mail_victim’s_email”.

The XLS file used in attacks

The malicious macro-enabled XLS file is similar to the ones we’ve seen in previous attack
waves. It tries, by social engineering, to trick the recipient into ignoring the built-in Microsoft
Office Security Warning, thereby inadvertently executing the macro. The text in the document,
translated from Ukrainian reads: Attention! This document was created in a newer version of
Microsoft Office. Macros are needed to display the contents of the document.
Executing the macro leads to the launch of a malicious trojan-downloader that attempts to
download and execute the final payload from a remote server.

Disassembled code from dropped executable

The server hosting the final payload is located in Ukraine and was taken offline after a
notification from CERT-UA and CyS-CERT.
3/5

We expected to see the BlackEnergy malware as the final payload, but a different malware
was used this time. The attackers used modified versions of an open-source gcat backdoor
written in the Python programming language. The python script was converted into a standalone executable using PyInstaller program.

Obfuscated code of GCat backdoor

This backdoor is able to download executables and execute shell-commands. Other GCat
backdoor functionality, such as making screenshots, keylogging, or uploading files, was
removed from the source code. The backdoor is controlled by attackers using a GMail account,
which makes it difficult to detect such traffic in the network.
ESET security solutions detect the threat as:
VBA/TrojanDropper.Agent.EY
Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.CBC
Python/Agent.N

Thoughts and conclusions
Ever since the first blogposts following our discovery of these cyberattacks, they have gained
widespread media attention. The reasons for that are twofold:
It is probably the first case where a mass-scale electrical power outage has been caused
by a malware cyberattack.
Mainstream media have popularly attributed the attacks to Russia, based on claims of
several security companies that the organization using BlackEnergy, a.k.a. Sandworm,
a.k.a. Quedagh, is Russian state-sponsored.
The first point has been a subject of debate as to whether the malware actually caused the
power outage or whether it only “enabled” it. While there is a difference in the technical
aspects between the two, and while we’re naturally interested in the smallest details when
conducting malware analysis, on a higher level, it doesn’t really matter. As a matter of fact, it is
the very essence of malicious backdoors – to grant attackers remote access to an infected
system.
The second point is even more controversial. As we have stated before, great care should be
taken before accusing a specific actor, especially a nation state. We currently have no
evidence that would indicate who is behind these cyberattacks and to attempt attribution by

4/5

simple deduction based on the current political situation might bring us to the correct answer,
or it might not. In any case, it is speculation at best. The current discovery suggests that the
possibility of false flag operations should also be considered.
To sum it up, the current discovery does not bring us any closer to uncovering the origins of
the attacks in Ukraine. On the contrary, it reminds us to avoid jumping to rash conclusions.
We continue to monitor the situation for future developments. For any inquiries or to make
