Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for July: WICKED
SPIDER
July 26, 2018
Adam Meyers Research & Threat Intel

WICKED SPIDER (PANDA) is a suspected China-based adversary that likely operates
as an exploitation group for hire. The use of two cryptonyms for this group exemplifies
how this adversary has demonstrated two different motivations for conducting malicious
cyber operations.
WICKED PANDA refers to the targeted intrusion operations of the actor publicly known as
“Winnti,” whereas WICKED SPIDER represents this group’s financially-motivated criminal
activity. Originally, WICKED SPIDER was observed exploiting a number of gaming
companies and stealing code-signing certificates for use in other operations associated with
the malware known as Winnti. Now, Winnti is commonly associated with the interests of the
government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

The flexibility of the cryptonym system used by CrowdStrike to track adversaries is
highlighted by the case of WICKED PANDA/SPIDER. In this instance, one set of activity
associated with criminal motivations can be easily separated from a second set of
behaviors by the same actor when operating in the interest of a nation-state.
The WICKED PANDA adversary makes use of a number of open-source and custom
tools to infect and move laterally in victim networks. Analysis of these tools and
infrastructure linked to WICKED PANDA operations has traced these operations back to
contractors who count multiple Chinese government agencies as clients, including the
Ministry of Public Security (MPS). Observed targeting by the WICKED PANDA adversary
has focused on high-value entities in the engineering, manufacturing and technology
sectors, aligning with the PRC’s strategic economic plans. WICKED PANDA has also
targeted chemical and think tank sectors around the world.
Most recently, our cyber threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting teams identified
ongoing activity by WICKED PANDA targeting organizations in the mining sector, where
they attempted to perform lateral movement and credential harvesting before being
contained by customer responders and the CrowdStrike Falcon® endpoint protection
platform.
As for WICKED SPIDER, earlier this year the Falcon OverWatch team identified malicious
activity on the network of a company operating in the technology sector. The incident
involved the PlugX malware, as well as a scanning and exploitation tool for the
ETERNALBLUE vulnerability with support for DOUBLEPULSAR.

Wicked Spider’s Targets
WICKED SPIDER has been observed targeting technology companies in Germany,
Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the
United States, and elsewhere. Notably, WICKED SPIDER has often targeted gaming
companies for their certificates, which can be used in future PRC-based operations to sign
malware. Ongoing analysis is still evaluating how these certificates are used — whether
WICKED SPIDER hands the certificates off to other adversaries for use in future campaigns
or stockpiles them for its own use.
