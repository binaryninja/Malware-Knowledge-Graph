The Curious Case of the Malicious IIS Module
trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/The-Curious-Case-of-the-Malicious-IIS-Module/

Recently, we've seen a few instances of a malicious DLL that is installed as an IIS module
making its rounds in forensic cases. This module is of particular concern as it is currently
undetectable by almost all anti-virus products. The malware is used by attackers to target
sensitive information in POST requests, and has mechanisms in place for data exfiltration.
Encryption is circumvented as the malware extracts this data from IIS itself. This was seen
targeting credit card data on e-commerce sites, however, it could also be used to steal
logins, or any other sensitive information sent to a compromised IIS instance. Please note
that this is not related in any way to the recent 'Pony' malware that was reported. Pony
targets the end-users, while this malware goes after the web servers themselves.
One of my YARA rulesets that I created for this family of malware triggered, leading me to
the following:

As it turns out, this happens to be the original installer for the IIS module I'm referring to,
and it seemed like the perfect time to throw a write-up together. I decided to write this post
for a couple of reasons:

1/7

1. At the time of writing this post, anti-virus do not currently detect any of the IIS modules
dropped by this malware. Even the installer is only picked up by a handful of anti-virus
products, and in all cases it's simply generic heuristic detection. I'm using this post as
a way of notifying anti-virus vendors so that specific detections for this malware may
be written.
2. I think the malware is pretty neat.
So with that, let's talk about this thing. For the sake of my own sanity, I'm going to be
referring to this malware as 'ISN' going forward, as this three character string is referenced
in all of the malware's exfiltration commands.
Let's take a look at the installer first. The file can take a number of arguments, as you can
see below:
-path : [Location where malware is installed]
-i : [List of URI paths to be targeted, such as '/sensitive.aspx'
-u : [Uninstall malware]
-is632 : [Manually instruct malware that victim is IIS6 32-Bit]
-is664 : [Manually instruct malware that victim is IIS6 64-Bit]
In truth, the installer is quite simple. It has four embedded DLLs (in the PE resource section)
that are dropped depending on the victim. There are IIS modules for the following:
IIS6 32-Bit
IIS6 64-Bit
IIS7+ 32-Bit
IIS7+ 64-Bit
Additionally, the ISN malware has a VBS file that is also embedded as a PE resource (See
the reference section below for full output and VirusTotal link). This VBS file is used to install
or remove the DLLs as an IIS module.
Once run, ISN will perform the following:
1. Drop the VBS file to the location specified by '-path', or the current working directory.
This file is removed before the ISN installer is finished.
2. Create a configuration file ([filename].cfg) in the same directory. This file contains a list
of
3. URIs that are targeted by the malware.
4. Detect the IIS version as well as the victim architecture.
5. Drop the appropriate DLL to the installation directory.
6. Call the VBS file in order to install the DLL as an IIS module.
The malicious IIS module is installed as whatever the name of the executable is. For my
demonstration, I've named the malware 'isn.exe', which results in the following:

2/7

As the installation process takes place, a log file named '[filename].log' is created and a
number of debugging statements are written to it.

Once the module is successfully installed, it will monitor the URIs specified in the
configuration file and dump any POST requests encountered to the '[filename].log' file. The
module will also monitor the QUERY_STRING parameter, and can accept a number of
commands. I've setup a simple IIS instance to demonstrate how this process takes place.
As we can see below, I've created a simple web form that would mimic an actual ecommerce site. A user would enter their name and credit card number and submit the
information, which is simply replayed back to them in '/buy.aspx'.

3/7

I've also setup a self-signed certificate so that all of the communicate takes place over SSL.

4/7

However, this transaction took place on an IIS instance with the ISN malware. The
configuration has been set to track POST requests to '/buy.aspx'. As we see below, when
this POST request occurs, the ISN malware creates a log file with this information stored in
the clear.

Now, I mentioned earlier that the ISN malware monitors QUERY_STRING parameters.
Specifically, it will look for the following commands:
isn_getlog – return the contents of the isn.log file
isn_logdel – delete the isn.log file
isn_logpath – return the path of the isn.log file
These commands can be sent remotely simply by providing them as a GET parameter.
'isn_getlog' example:

'isn_logdel' example:

Overall, this malware does not appear to be widely spread and has only been seen in a few
forensic case instances. However, the extremely low detection rate in collaboration with the
malware's targeted functionality makes this a very real threat.
Trustwave's WebDefend and ModSecurity can be used to both block the initial point of
infection for this malware and detect whether sensitive user data such as credit card
numbers appear in outbound data.
