Introduction
ESET and Group-IB researchers have seen and analysed a good deal of Russian malware, but some of
the most interesting examples have been malicious programs that steal money from Remote
Banking Systems (RBS), targeting major companies that carry out thousands of financial transactions
a day. This type of malware was discussed at some length in a presentation at CARO 2011 on
“Cybercrime in Russia: Trends and issues” and some later presentations.
In November 2011, we examined some interesting modifications to Win32/Carberp, discussing the
use of the Zerokit bootkit builder – also associated with the Rovnix bootkit – and considering the
likelihood that the gang concerned is working on the development of more effective ways of evading
antivirus detection.
In December, we published another blog discussing the dramatic rise in Carberp-related incidents
and linking it with the Black Hole exploit kit, as well as with the parallel development and evolution
of SpyEye, indicating the way in which cybercriminal activity has been growing and evolving with
respect to various payment systems, in Russia in particular.
This paper summarizes this information in a single document, and also includes a resources list for
further reading.

Deep Diving
In November 2011 we discovered new information on a new modification of Trojan of
Win32/TrojanDownloader.Carberp family. This trojan is notorious as one of the most widely spread
malicious programs in Russia, stealing money from remote banking systems and primarily targeting
companies which perform a huge number of financial transactions a day. We already shed some
light on this malware in our CARO 2011 presentation “Cybercrime in Russia: Trends and issues”. The
cybercrime group behind this Trojan is very active in the territory of Russia and the former Soviet
republics. We spotted the first cases related to the Carberp trojan around the end of 2010 and in the
middle of the summer of 2011 we can see from the following graph that there was a big spike in the
number of detections, a pattern which has been repeated at the beginning of the fall.

The Russian Federation is the country where the largest number of installations of Carberp has been
seen, as confirmed by the statistics below:

The criminal gang behind Carberp is one of the biggest cybercrime groups engaged in banking fraud.
The group’s average weekly income is estimated to be several million US dollars. Furthermore, these
guys are heavily investing money in the development of malware technologies, as is confirmed for
instance, by the evolution of the Hodprot dropper: this has been implicated in installations of
Carberp, RDPdoor and Sheldor. RDPdoor, by the way, installs Carberp to open a backdoor in the
infected system and manually perform fraudulent banking transactions. We have ascertained that
these examples of malicious software are products of single cybercrime group.
At the beginning of this year advertising appeared on some cybercrime forums for a new bootkit
builder which wasn’t detected by antivirus software. The price of the builder was estimated to be
tens of thousands of US dollars and seemed incredibly high compared with that of the SpyEye and
Zeus Trojans.

It isn’t known how many groups bought the builder. We managed to obtain a sample of the
compiled dropper with the builder which loads a stub driver. The code in the sample is identical to
those of some other examples of malicious software. At the time the only known malware utilizing

the same bootkit component was the Rovnix bootkit (http://blog.eset.com/2011/08/23/hasta-la-vistabootkit-exploiting-the-vbr). Testing of the Carperb Trojan with bootkit functionality started early in
the fall and during this period its distribution was very limited. There are two facts that suggest that
the bot is working in the test mode. The first is that there is an abundance of debugging and tracing
information relating to bot installation and the binary’s behavior. Secondly we managed to gain
access to log files from the bot C&C server that also support the probability that Carberp was under
test:

C&C for tested bot version
There is also a lot of debugging information to be found in the installer of the new version of
Carberp:

The bootkit component of the new version remains the same and is almost identical to that of
Rovnix bootkit. You can also find technical details of the Rovnix bookit in the slides of the "Defeating
x64: Modern Trends of Kernel-Mode Rootkits" talk given at the Ekoparty 2011 Security conference.
At the same time, its installer has been changed significantly. Besides installing the bootkit in the
system it tries to exploit several vulnerabilities in the target system so as to escalate its privileges.
Carberp utilizes these exploits as it requires administrative privileges in order to install the bootkit.
Primarily, the Carberp Trojan targets corporate users using RBS (Remote Banking Systems) software
which in many cases lack administrative privileges, so that a social engineering attack isn’t applicable
or sufficient in this scenario. Therefore the installer exploits the following vulnerabilities in the
system software in order to escalate privilege:
MS10-073 (win32k.sys KeyboardLayout vuln)
MS10-092 (Task Scheduler vuln)
MS11-011 (win32k.sys SystemDefaultEUDCFont vuln)
.NET Runtime Optimization vulnerability (http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/71013)

Yet another interesting feature of the installer of the new version of Carberp is that it removes
various hooks from the following list of system routines just before installing the trojan or bootkit
onto the system:

This is done with the intention of evading sandboxes and other monitoring software that employs
user-mode hooks.
The bootkit itself is intended to load a kernel-mode driver which in turn injects a malicious DLL into
address spaces of processes running on the system. In the new version of Carberp we found only a
32-bit kernel-mode driver, but the technology in use makes it possible to load a 64-bit unsigned
kernel-mode driver on 64-bit operating systems.
After unpacking the injected kernel-mode driver we can find the compiler version and date of build:

www.eset.com

Based on the data provided above the driver was built at the beginning of November and is being
tested right now. The linker has left an interesting string in the driver binary containing the path to
debugging symbols on the developer’s computers:

It seems that this is not the first and possibly not the last version of the malware to appear recently.
Since there are only two known examples of malware (Carberp and Rovnix) employing this particular
bootkit technique, the development of which requires highly qualified specialists, it is possible that
the group which originally developed this bootkit is currently supporting it.
As was mentioned earlier in this article, the main task of the driver is to inject its payload into usermode address space of the process in the system.

After unpacking the DLL injected by the kernel-mode driver we can see that the date of its
compilation is different to that of kernel-mode driver.

www.eset.com

Inside the binary we found a string pointing to other directory containing debugging symbols. We
can see “GSVSoft” as the name of a root-level directory.

Since the dates of compilation and paths to debugging symbols directories are not the same it may
be that there are two independent groups of people working on the malware. By the way, there is a
real company with the name “GSVSoft” (gsvsoft.ru) but we don’t have enough information to draw
any conclusions from that.
The main functionality of the injected library is very close to that of the previous version of Carberp.
Its main task is to inject JS-scripts into internet banking webpages, downloading additional plugins
and communicating with the C&C server.
Based on the information presented above we can conclude that the authors of the malware aren’t
satisfied with current methods of concealing malware in the system, and so are investing money into
developing their own techniques for bypassing antivirus software. The evolution of this malware led
Carberp to become the number one malware attacking the clients of Russian banks (there also
governmental organizations that became victims of this trojan). The new version of Carberb with
bootkit can be compared to such advanced malware as TDL4 and Rovnix.
Even though Carberp is currently targeting only Russian banks, this situation might rapidly change as
there are no obstacles to applying the same fraudulent techniques in order to target banks in other
countries. A possible reason that the cybercrime group doesn’t attempt to target other regions is
that it is satisfied with current conditions and revenue, at least until a new partnership draws them
to spread to other parts of the world. In the last year we have noticed some Carperp activity in
Europe, but this declined rapidly.
In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in the Russian region in the number of sites
redirecting users to the Black Hole exploit kit In most cases, successful exploitation of a vulnerability
in client software leads to the installation onto the victim’s machine of either the trojan
Win32/TrojanDownloader.Carberp or or of Win32/Carberp (the version updated to incorporate
bootkit functionality, as described in http://blog.eset.com/2011/11/21/evolution-of-win32carberpgoing-deeper). One of the most intriguing aspects is that distribution of the malware was restricted
to the most popular web sites for people managing finances in companies: these sites are visited
several hundred thousand times a day. The statistics presented below clearly reflect an increase in
Carberp detections in the Russian region during November. This trojan takes fifth place in the list of
the most widely spread malware: Win32/TrojanDownloader.Carberp.AF - 1.73 %.
The number of detections of the Carberp family in general has more than tripled in November:

The distribution model is essentially a standard approach, but what makes it interesting is the
number of legitimate web resources used to deliver Carberp onto the victim’s computers. The
distribution scheme is depicted below:

Based on the statistics obtained from one of the nodes hosting an active Black Hole exploit pack, the
most frequently exploited vulnerabilities leading to system infection with malware are found in Java
software.

www.eset.com

11

In the last year Java has outpaced last year’s “leaders” in exploitable application formats such as
PDF and SWF (Adobe Flash file format), which are now more or less equal in second place (Figure 3).
The vulnerabilities in Java are easier and more consistently exploitable than those in PDF and SWF.
The code required for aworking exploit is fairly small, and may be only a page in length. The
exploited vulnerabilities aren’t really new: some of them are more than a year old.
Below you can see a screenshot demonstrating the configuration window for an address to which
users are redirected from legitimate web sites. There may be many such addresses. Sometimes the
address is generated dynamically, based on parameters determined from the victim’s browser.

Once the vulnerability has been successfully exploited the dropper is executed: in this case it is
Carberp that is being dropped. To prevent antivirus software detecting the dropper the Black Hole
exploit kit includes functionality for measuring dropper detections by the most widely used antivirus
software. When the number of detections reaches a defined value the dropper is repacked by the
service responsible for it.

As we can see this is quite an effective system for exploiting vulnerabilities and installing malware on
the victims’ machines. The price for Black hole – including support – is in the order of several
thousand US dollars, but cyber criminals offer rather flexible pricing: thus, it is possible to rent the
service for up to a day.
This is what exploitation of a Java vulnerability looks like:

13
And this is a gate configuration file for distributing the Carberp dropper:

Recently we’ve been finding targeting plugins installed by Carberp in case it detects SberBank and
CyberPlat payment software in the system.
In most cases the plugins are stored in publicly accessible directories and are downloaded by the
malware on demand. In order to conceal the functionality of the downloaded modules they are
downloaded encrypted. Here is the script to encipher the plugins:

An RC2 cipher and BASE64 encoding algorithm are used to encrypt data. In most cases the
encryption key is stored inside BASE64-encoded data.
Another malicious program worth some attention is SpyEye. From the following chart we can see
that its activity has increased significantly in November.

www.eset.com

Figure 9
SpyEye is distributed by regions as shown in the next chart:

Russia takes second place in distribution of SpyEye. There is a reason for this: we’ve recently
detected a SpyEye sample which downloaded plugins into the system for stealing money from
Russian RBS (Remote Banking Service) systems.

A more interesting feature is that the configuration file includes rules for taking screenshots which
contain not only names of banks but also of big Russian companies:

All these features indicate that cybercriminal activity has been growing and evolving with respect to
various payment systems.
