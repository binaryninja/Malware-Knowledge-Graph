Back to School: BEC Group Targets Teachers with
Payroll Diversion Attacks

Discover how threat group Chiffon Herring leverages impersonation and spoofed email
addresses to divert paychecks to mule accounts.
Fall in the northern hemisphere is marked by a variety of things: leaves changing colors, the
sun setting earlier, and the ubiquitous return of pumpkin spice flavoring. For many parents
and their children, it’s also time to go back to school—whether they’re ready for summer to
be over or not.
Unfortunately, some scammers exploit the back-to-school season for their own nefarious
purposes. Like most financially-motivated cybercrime, business email compromise (BEC)
attacks are generally industry agnostic, meaning attackers don’t specifically target certain
industries or companies. Rather, financially-motivated cybercriminals try to maximize their
return on investment by casting a wide net of potential victims.
However, our Abnormal team has identified a specific group bucking this trend, which we call
Chiffon Herring. The group has been active since at least March 2022 and mainly targets
local school districts and universities in the United States.

Their targets have ranged from large public universities to small community colleges, and
from sprawling urban school districts to an individual all-girls preparatory school. Based on
our research, Chiffon Herring actors are likely located in Nigeria and South Africa, both of
which are typical hotbeds for BEC scammers.

A Background on Payroll Diversion
Payroll diversion is a popular form of business email compromise where an attacker targets
a human resources administrator and impersonates an employee (usually an executive) to
request a change to the employee’s direct deposit account information.
In its early days, payroll diversion attacks almost exclusively targeted organizations in the
United States. But in recent years, these attacks have shifted and are now targeting
employees across the world—specifically in Western Europe and Australia.
The payroll diversion landscape is primarily driven by the use of mule accounts, or accounts
that receive fraudulent funds, at non-traditional financial technology institutions. Accounts
linked to prepaid cards or third-party apps like Green Dot or CashApp make up an
overwhelming percentage of the mule accounts associated with payroll diversion attacks.

Setting the Hook: A Look at Chiffon Herring’s Emails
Chiffon Herring is notably unique in that the group almost exclusively targets local school
districts and universities.
The general structure of an attack from this group is similar to many other payroll diversion
attacks. However, instead of impersonating company executives, Chiffon Herring generally
poses as non-executive employees like teachers and professors and sends the attacks to
the department head at a university or office staff at a school district. Because their names
and email addresses are publicly listed on most school websites, these individuals can be
incredibly easy to impersonate and target.
An initial email from Chiffon Herring indicates the impersonated teacher has recently
changed banks and needs to update their direct deposit information. The email also
mentions that the previous account will be inactive a few days before the next payday,
injecting some urgency into the request.
Example of an initial Chiffon Herring email
A notable tactic used by Chiffon Herring is spoofing the email address of the teachers they
impersonate, which makes the email seem as if it’s coming from a teacher’s legitimate email
account. Behind the scenes, however, the reply-to address is a Gmail or mail.com account
controlled by the attacker, which is where any subsequent communications would be sent.

Schools can often be an easier target for attackers because they are unlikely to have
stringent cybersecurity protocols—unlike large enterprises or government entities. In the
case of the institutions targeted here, there is either no published DMARC record in place or
it is not configured to reject unauthorized senders. This allows the attackers to use the exact
domain and thus bypass legacy systems that check only for this header information to detect
attacks.
In addition to spoofing impersonated teacher email addresses, an analysis of email headers
reveals Chiffon Herring also leverages GoDaddy infrastructure to send the attacks. The
“Workspace Webmail 6.12.10” user agent string referenced in the headers indicates the
emails are coming from GoDaddy’s webmail service, and the domains referenced in the
header “return-path” field signals a potentially compromised domain. The abuse of GoDaddy
domains to send malicious email campaigns is a longstanding problem that has been around
for years.

Reeling It In: Where the Stolen Teacher Paychecks Go
If a targeted employee responds to the initial email from Chiffon Herring, the attack moves
into the second stage. In this stage, the attacker provides details for a mule account to which
they want the impersonated teacher’s paycheck diverted.
Our team conducts active defense engagements with BEC actors to better understand the
full cycle of BEC attacks, including identifying mule accounts scammers use to receive
fraudulent funds. In this case, we were able to identify one of the accounts associated with
this group.

Chiffon Herring almost exclusively provides Green Dot accounts as an initial “replacement”
direct deposit account, which are generally linked to prepaid cards. Prepaid cards are
commonly used in payroll diversion attacks because many card issuers offer the option to
receive direct deposits up to 48 hours before a payday. This means that the threat actors
have access to the diverted funds for multiple days before the teacher even realizes anything
is wrong.
The accounts are also relatively easy to open. A prepaid card can be obtained at a big box
store like Walmart, and then once the card is “registered,” a checking account is created that
can be used to receive funds. An account can also be opened online using a fake identity
and the new account details are emailed to a scammer.

Securing Schools Against Cybercrime
3/6

Threat actors continue to execute these attacks because they work. They have spent years
perfecting the writing of these emails to make them look as legitimate as possible. And
because they are not often the target of coordinated cyberattacks, many schools may not be
aware that they are being targeted by these scams.
To ensure protection against payroll diversion attacks, it is critical that all staff (and
particularly those in finance and human resources) are trained to detect the signs of phishing
attacks. They should be reminded to read through emails carefully, and pay close attention to
the email addresses to make sure they are actually coming from the sender—especially
when discussing something related to finances.
It’s also important to implement an email security solution that can detect signs of attacks
and block malicious emails before they reach their intended recipient. Innovative solutions
use behavioral AI to analyze identity and content and then separate legitimate messages
from dangerous threats. By baselining known-good behavior and detecting anomalies,
modern email security solutions can block the socially-engineered attacks that bypass legacy
systems.
