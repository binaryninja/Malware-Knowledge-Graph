Detecting MaliBot, a fresh Android banking trojan, with a Fraud Protection solution
Flubot is dead, and the new evil is detected and crowned, the first of his name – MaliBot.
Well, in fact this new MaliBot is a revised follower of another Android banking trojan –
S.O.V.A. MaliBot malware, usually disguised as a cryptocurrency mining application, targets
Android devices and uses overlay attacks to outfox MFA/2FA, capture messages and SMS,
and steal banking and crypto credentials.
By this moment, it has mainly threatened financial sector companies in Spain and Italy.
Obviously, it has an ominous ambition and surely still untapped potential to infuse into other
industries and conquer new territories.
In this article we will tell in more detail what techniques exist against such attacks, and give
you a live demonstration of how Group-IB Fraud Protection stops MaliBot or other similar
threats.

Challenging anti-fraud professionals
As you can clearly see, this malware is powerful and tricky, which makes it a real challenge
to detect this attack and other similar to MaliBot malwares with an average anti-fraud tool.
That’s actually why the financial sector is such fertile soil for threat actors successfully
stealing money from banking and cryptocurrency accounts.
MaliBot operators harness a variety of distribution campaigns: they promote cryptocurrency
applications in the form of APKs that victims are supposed to download and install manually;
they clone real projects like TheCryptoApp (1M+ downloads on Google Play Store);
operators also use smishing (SMS phishing) and other methods to multiply their chances to
succeed.
Even though the overall context looks scary, fear not because advanced solutions and
tactics, developed to respond to similar web injection threats and this particular one, do exist,
and one of them is almost at your doorstep.

Proven tactics to respond
There are at least two major countermeasures to leverage against such fraud attacks.
According to your case, you have a choice between fraud intelligence and behavioral
analysis. Let us explain to you what’s the difference and how it works.
The signature-based analysis utilizes the abilities of fraud intelligence to collect information
about the application and compare its certification deviation to other application certificates.
Once information about installed applications is gathered, it is essential to match them with
already known trojan signatures.
Here are some examples of suspicious Android permissions:

RECEIVE_SMS
Another way to thwart such attacks is a so-called behavioral analysis that
comprises overlay or accessibility service detections;
realizes default SMS application monitoring;
captures the slightest deviations in the user's behavior routine.

Every tiny derogation matters here: the speed of movement, pressure on the screen while
using the app, and other factors that could drop an alert about anomalies.
