In late October and early November, 2017, CrowdStrike® Falcon Intelligence™ observed
People’s Republic of China (PRC)-based actors conducting espionage-driven targeted
attacks against at least four Western think tanks and an additional two non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). This marks a significant increase in China-based activity from
months prior, as the majority of observed activity in Q3 was predominantly focused on
Southeast and East Asia. The previous “smash-and-grab” type of cyber operations, which
typically characterized a majority of pre-2016 PRC espionage cases, appear to have
ceased in favor of much more targeted intrusions focused on specific outcomes.
Previous operations targeting think tanks resembled the digital equivalents of so-called
smash-and-grab robberies: the attackers indiscriminately exfiltrated data, vacuuming up
whatever information was available. However, in these most recent incidents, threat actors
specifically targeted the communications of foreign personnel involved in Chinese economic
policy research and the Chinese economy, as well as users with noted expertise in defense,
international finance, U.S.-Sino relations, cyber governance, and democratic elections.

The majority of these intrusions leveraged the China Chopper webshell and/or credential
harvesting tools targeting the Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure such as Mimikatz to
compromise credentials for lateral movement in victim networks. Typically, the adversary
also retrieved second-stage tools from an external staging server. Actors often searched for
very specific strings, such as “china”, “cyber”, “japan”, “korea”, “chinese” and “eager lion” —
the latter is likely a reference to a multinational annual military exercise held in Jordan.
In at least two cases, adversaries were observed conducting email directory dumps for a full
listing of departments within the victim organizations. Not only does this tactic help refine a
list of targeted personnel within the organization, but access to a legitimate email server can
provide a platform for conducting future spear-phishing operations. Nearly all the affected
organizations likely maintain close ties to Western government officials. This makes them
an attractive target for mounting further attacks against government-supporting sectors,
since the intruders can masquerade as trusted sources when sending spear-phishing
emails.

PANDA vs. Falcon
An interesting case study was observed by both CrowdStrike Services and the Falcon
OverWatch™ managed hunting team in late October 2017, when a China-based adversary
attempted to compromise the web server of a think tank. The specific target appeared to be
related to an ongoing military research project. As with many of the currently observed
Chinese targeted intrusions, the adversary attempted to use China Chopper for
reconnaissance and lateral movement after logging in via an account compromised by
spear phishing. As is prevalent among CrowdStrike customers, webshell blocking was
enabled in the Falcon endpoint protection platform, which prevented the actor from using
the webshell to run any commands.
The operator attempted to access the server using the China Chopper shell for four days in
a row, showing particular dedication to targeting this endpoint. The actor attempted several
whoami requests during normal Beijing business hours. On the fourth day, after repeated
failures, subsequent access attempts occurred at 11 p.m. Beijing time. This after-hours
attempt was likely conducted by a different operator, or possibly someone called in to
troubleshoot the webshell. After a quick series of tests, the activity ceased and no attempts
were made over the weekend. Except for the 11 p.m. login, the observed activity suggests
that the adversary is a professional outfit with normal operating hours and assigned tasks.
On the following Monday, the actors returned, logging into the same user account and
attempting a different shell, however, this attempt was also quickly staunched by
CrowdStrike Services. After being forced out again, the actor appeared to switch tactics and
returned via the same account to conduct a SQL injection on the web server. When the
attempt failed yet again, the user signed out and a separate host began conducting a lowvolume DDoS attack on the think tank’s website.

2/5

This case is notable for several reasons. First, the adversary showed a high degree of
persistence and dedication to compromising the target, over the course of a week. Also,
they used a different shell, failed, and then attempted to conduct a SQL attack on the
server. While this may not be unusual on its own, the short timeline in which it was carried
out shows the adversary’s skill at adaptation. The multiple attempts to gain access also
highlight the likely importance of the project and/or reveal that the adversary was under
specific time constraints.
The final step of conducting a DDoS attack on the think tank’s site was unusual when
viewed in the context of an espionage operation. The purpose of the attack is unclear, as it
did not appear to benefit the espionage objective. Given the timing and subsequent failures
at gaining access to what is presumably a high-value target, this DDoS attack could have
been done out of frustration.
This is believed to be the first time CrowdStrike has observed a China-based adversary
engaging in a disruptive attack against what was previously (and likely, still is) an espionage
target as a follow-on to normal espionage activities.

Outlook
China’s renewed interest in targeting Western think tanks and NGOs is hardly surprising
given President XI Jinping’s call to improve China’s think tanks, a response to myriad new
strategic problems facing China as it seeks greater influence as a global player. The
targeting of these six organizations may signal a more widespread and active campaign to
collect sensitive material and enable future operations. Individuals and enterprises that
maintain relationships with Western think tanks and NGOs are advised to take appropriate
precautions — system security review, additional user awareness training, and ensuring
comprehensive endpoint visibility are critical to identifying and preventing threats from
advanced adversaries. The increase in operational tempo by Chinese associated intrusion
actors that was observed during 2017 is covered in more detail in the upcoming
CrowdStrike Global Threat Report 2017.
