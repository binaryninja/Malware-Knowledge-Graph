“Keeper” Magecart Group Infects 570 Sites
Previous Next

Key Findings
Gemini discovered that the “Keeper” Magecart group, which consists of an
interconnected network of 64 attacker domains and 73 exfiltration domains, has
targeted over 570 victim e-commerce sites in 55 different countries from April 1, 2017
until the present. The Keeper exfiltration and attacker domains use identical login
panels and are linked to the same dedicated server; this server hosts both the
malicious payload and the exfiltrated data stolen from victim sites.
Over 85% of the victim sites operated on the Magento CMS, which is known to be the
top target for Magecart attacks and boasts over 250,000 users worldwide. The country
hosting the largest selection of these victim e-commerce sites was the United States,
followed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Gemini uncovered an unsecured access log on the Keeper control panel with 184,000
compromised cards with time stamps ranging from July 2018 to April 2019.
Extrapolating the number of cards per nine months to Keeper’s overall lifespan, and
given the dark web median price of $10 per compromised Card Not Present (CNP)
card, this group has likely generated upwards of $7 million USD from selling
compromised payment cards.
The Keeper Magecart group has been active for three years, over which time it has
continually improved its technical sophistication and the scale of its operations. Based
on this pattern of successful Magecart attacks, Gemini assesses with high confidence
that Keeper is likely to continue launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against
online merchants across the world.

Background
In mid-2020, Magecart attacks have become a daily occurrence for small to medium-sized ecommerce businesses in the United States as well as the rest of the world. Operating on an
outdated content management system (CMS), utilizing unpatched add-ons, or having
administrators’ credentials compromised through sequel injections leaves e-commerce
merchants vulnerable to a variety of different attack vectors. Over the past six months, the
Gemini team has uncovered thousands of Magecart attacks ranging from simple dynamic
injection of malicious code using a criminally hosted domain, to leveraging Google Cloud or
GitHub storage services and using steganography to embed malicious payment cardstealing code into an active domain’s logos and images. The criminals behind this threat
constantly evolve and improve their techniques to prey on unsuspecting victims who do not
emphasize domain security.
As has been previously reported, there are numerous stand-alone Magecart groups that
actively use unique methods to target hundreds and thousands of e-commerce sites yearly.
One such group was responsible for compromising a Volusion CMS, in turn infecting over
6,000 e-commerce sites with payment card-stealing scripts for nearly a month in the third
quarter of 2019.
While analyzing numerous Magecart attacks, Gemini successfully established a full link
between an active Magecart group, its techniques, indicators of compromised (IOCs),
evolving tactics, victims, and an estimated number of cards offered for sale. The Gemini
team has named this group “Keeper” based on its repeated usage of a single domain called
fileskeeper[.]org to inject malicious payment card-stealing JavaScript (JS) into the website’s
HTML code, as well as receive compromised card data. Analysis revealed that the Keeper
group includes an interconnected network of 64 attacker domains used to deliver malicious
JS payloads (see Appendix A) and 73 exfiltration domains used to receive stolen payment
cards data from victim domains (see Appendix B). This network targeted over 570 victim ecommerce sites in 55 different countries from April 1, 2017 until the present.

In-Depth Analysis
3/11

Keeper
The Keeper group, much like many other Magecart groups, attempted to disguise its
malicious attacker domains as legitimate services, or, in this case, even legitimate sites.
Several of the attacker domains attempted to closely imitate legitimate site names by
changing the top-level domain or several characters within the domain name. For example,
the attacker domain closetlondon[.]org attempted to imitate closetlondon.com. In addition to
imitating legitimate site names, this group also attempted to imitate popular website plugins
and payment gateways.
Gemini determined that Keeper’s exfiltration and attacker domains use identical login panels
and are linked to the same dedicated server; this server hosts both the malicious payload
and the exfiltrated data stolen from victim sites. Below is an example of how a dedicated
server is used to host Magecart infrastructure responsible for collecting compromised card
data from numerous e-commerce domains.

connected to a single dedicated server.
Over 85% of the victim sites operated on the Magento CMS, which is known to be the top
target for Magecart attacks and boasts over 250,000 users worldwide. The country hosting
the largest selection of these victim e-commerce sites was the United States, at 28%,
followed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

Through the analysis of the dedicated server and numerous hosted exfiltration and attacker
domains, Gemini was able to identify over 570 individuals attacks on numerous e-commerce
sites across the world that occurred between April 2017 and the present (see Appendix C).
By analyzing victim domains and the payload scripts that were used to infect them, analysts
discovered the evolution of obfuscation and data collection methods.
April 1, 2017: One of the initial attacks was carried out against dressedinwhite.com
through the attacker domain js-storage[.]click. The Keeper group utilized public
obfuscation methods, which made it simple to decode. The JS payload was created to
focus primarily on two specific payment card data fields (card number and expiration
date), but also to gather all other available fields on the checkout page.
August 9, 2018: The online bicycle merchant milkywayshop.it was infected by the
attacker domain dobell[.]su. The malicious JS payload was hiding in plain sight and did
not have any private or public obfuscation and displayed the payload in cleartext. The
payload collected all of the data from the fields commonly seen on the checkout page,
such as card data, billing information, and additional personally identifiable information
(PII).

November 26, 2018: From November 2018 to the present, the threat actors have used
custom obfuscation methods. This was first identified in the infection of
casterdepot.com. The JS payload was injected by the attacker domain
swappastore[.]com and collected information from all commonly seen fields on the
checkout page, such as card data, billing information, and additional PII.

January 6, 2019: The attacker script was modified and it appeared to be much cleaner
and more concise with no displayed line breaks. This was seen in the infection of
nomin.net by the attacker domain scriptvault[.]org. The Keeper group currently uses
this format for its payloads and denotes specific payment card, billing address, and
additional information fields that it collects.

During the analysis of an ongoing infection in one of the victim URLs, fiushafashion.com,
Gemini conducted a test transaction with fictitious data and decrypted, then decoded the
malicious payment request. Gemini analysts noted that the payment card data, billing
information, additional PII, and source URL were exfiltrated to the Keeper exfiltration domain
assetstorage[.]net.

Total Revenue
During the historical analysis of the Keeper group, Gemini uncovered an unsecured
access.log on the Keeper control panel on April 24, 2019. This access log stored 184,000
compromised cards with time stamps ranging from July 2018 to April 2019. This likely
indicated the total number of cards collected from numerous Keeper infections during this
time period. Based on the provided number of collected cards during a nine-month window,
and accounting for the group’s operations since April 2017, Gemini estimates that it has
likely collected close to 700,000 compromised cards. Given the current dark web median
price of $10 per compromised Card Not Present (CNP) card, this group has likely generated
upwards of $7 million USD from stealing and selling compromised payment cards in its full
lifespan.
Targets
The 570 victim e-commerce sites were made up of small to medium-sized merchants and
were scattered across 55 different countries. Gemini analyzed the size of the victims’ sites
using Amazon’s Alexa Rank, which generates a basic score based on daily unique visitors
and the number of pageviews. Victims with the top Alexa Global Ranking received anywhere
from 500,000 to over one million visitors each month and were responsible for selling
electronics, clothing, jewelry, custom promotional products, and liquor. The table below
provides several examples of the most affected merchants with top Alexa Global Ranking
(meaning more traffic per website).

Conclusion

10/11

The Keeper Magecart group has been active for three years, over which time it has
continually improved its technical sophistication and the scale of its operations. It has
verifiably compromised hundreds of domains and likely extracted payment card information
from many more that have yet to be uncovered. With revenue likely exceeding $7 million and
increased cybercriminal interest in CNP data during the COVID-19 quarantine measures
across the world, this group’s market niche appears to be secure and profitable. Based on
this pattern of successful Magecart attacks, Gemini assesses with high confidence that
Keeper is likely to continue launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against online
merchants across the world.
