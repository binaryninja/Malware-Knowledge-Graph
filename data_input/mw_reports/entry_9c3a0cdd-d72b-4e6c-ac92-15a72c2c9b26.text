Last Friday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of nine
Iranians who worked for an organization named the Mabna Institute. According to
prosecutors, the defendants stole more than 31 terabytes of data from universities,
companies, and government agencies around the world. The cost to the universities alone
reportedly amounted to approximately $3.4 billion. The information stolen from these
universities was used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or sold for profit
inside Iran.

PhishLabs has been tracking this same threat group since late-2017, designating them Silent
Librarian. Since discovery, we have been working with the FBI, ISAC partners, and other
international law enforcement agencies to help understand and mitigate these attacks.
The details of the phishing attacks identified by PhishLabs give a broader sense of the
overall threat posed by this group when read alongside the crimes outlined in the indictment.
While the indictment details the finely-crafted spear phishing campaigns targeting university
professors, the attacks tracked by PhishLabs also involved the general targeting of university
students and faculty to collect credentials for the victims’ university library accounts. In light
of the news from Friday, we are sharing insights and research that provide additional context
to the Mabna Institute indictment.

History and Targets
PhishLabs began compiling attacks, lures, and other information tied to Silent Librarian in
December 2017. Starting with just two domains that hosted nearly two dozen university
phishing sites, we used PassiveDNS analysis, Whois data, SSL certificate monitoring, and
open source research to identify more phishing sites linked to the same group. To date, we
have identified more than 750 phishing attacks attributed to Silent Librarian dating back to
September 2013. These attacks have targeted more than 300 universities in 22
1/10

countries. While most of the targeted universities are located in the United States, Canada,
United Kingdom, and Australia, there have also been schools targeted in other countries in
Western Europe and Asia.

Countries targeted by Silent Librarian phishing attacks.
Looking at the list of university targets, it is clear that they are not randomly selected. All of
the universities targeted in the Silent Librarian campaigns are generally prominent research,
technical, or medical universities. Some schools in particular have been targeted numerous
times over the past four-and-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in
Australia, has been a popular Silent Librarian target. The university has been targeted more
than two dozen times by the group since the beginning of 2017. In addition to universities,
Silent Librarian has also targeted non-academic institutions, such as Los Alamos National
Laboratory, Electric Power Research Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ohio
State Wexner Medical Center, and Thomson Reuters.

Silent Librarian Lures
One of the notable aspects of Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that their tactics have
barely changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor spelling errors, the content
of the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely reason for this
consistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high enough that

there was no need for them to evolve. From a research perspective, though, the static
nature of the group’s lure made it easier for us to identify past campaigns and track new
campaigns as they occurred.

Overall, the lures constructed by Silent Librarian are remarkably authentic-looking. Spelling
and grammar, two of the primary indicators of a malicious email, are nearly perfect. The
message in the lures are contextually legitimate, meaning it is an email a recipient could be
reasonably expected to receive.
Most of the Silent Librarian lure emails contain spoofed sender email addresses, which make
them appear as if they’re coming from a legitimate source. Some of the phishing emails,
though, have been sent from temporary Gmail addresses. A small number of lures have
even been sent from what appear to be email accounts at various Turkish universities.

Each of the Silent Librarian lures ends with a very realistic looking closing signature
containing contact information for the target library. This information is collected through
open source research conducted by the threat actors. In some cases, all of the contact
information can be found together on one webpage; however, some of the information is in
different locations, indicating the actors are likely performing manual reconnaissance to
gather the information.
At least a third of the Silent Librarian lures identified use fictitious personas to add a sense of
authenticity to the emails. The names of these personas have evolved over time; however,
the group has used the personas “Sarah Miller” and “Susan Jackson” frequently in recent
campaigns. The group also changes the names of the personas to match the location of the
target university. For example, a recent campaign targeting an Australian university used the
persona “Jonathon Dixon,” while the persona identity “Shinsuke Hamada” was previously
used in an email lure targeting a Japanese school.

Like the overall content of their lures, the subject lines of Silent Librarian phishing emails
have remained consistent over time. Since the beginning of 2017, 97 percent of lures
contained the subject “Library Account,” “Library Notifications,” or “Library Services.”
Sometimes the name of the target university has been appended to the subject to add more
perceived authenticity to the attack vector.

Phishing Pages
We have identified 127 different domains used to host Silent Librarian phishing sites since
2013. Like a growing number of phishing sites, domains registered by Silent Librarian
generally use Freenom top-level domains (TLDs) (.TK, . CF, .GA, .GQ, .ML) because they

5/10

are available at no cost. The group has used domains on other TLDs, though rather
sparingly. Some of the other recent TLDs associated with Silent Librarian domains include
.IN, .IR, .INFO, .LINK, and .TOP.
Like their lures, the phishing sites crafted by Silent Librarian are very realistic. The URLs
associated with the phishing pages closely mirror the full legitimate URL path of the account
login page for the target university library.

The content of Silent Librarian phishing pages is almost identical to the legitimate target
sites. The actors likely scrape the original HTML source code from the legitimate library login
page, then edit the references to resources used to render the webpage (images, JavaScript,
CSS, etc.) to point back to the original page, a common tactic among phishers.

At the beginning of 2017, Silent Librarian began to regularly obtain free Let’s Encrypt SSL
certificates for their phishing pages. This technique, which we have previous discussed at
length in blog posts from November and December, is used to create more realistic-looking
phishing pages.

For a few of the Silent Librarian attacks, we identified and collected the phish kits that were
used to construct the phishing sites and left on the malicious server. Phish kits contain all of
the files necessary to stand up a phishing site quickly, such as HTML files, PHP mailing
scripts, and other resources (image files, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Because these kits are
essentially the “recipe” of how a phishing site is created, they can provide valuable
intelligence into the back-end functionality of the site. One of the best pieces of evidence that
can be collected from a phish kit is the PHP mailing script, which contains the location where
compromised information is sent, usually an email address. An analysis of the Silent
Librarian kits identified two email accounts that were used to receive compromised victim
credentials. One was a Gmail email address and the other was an email address with
Vatanmail, an Iranian email service provider.

What Happens to the Stolen Credentials?
As outlined in Friday’s indictment, in addition to being passed to the IRGC, some of the
stolen credentials were also sold on two Iranian websites, Megapaper[.]ir and Gigapaper[.]ir.
Similarly, the credentials stolen in the Silent Librarian phishing attacks we identified were
sold on an Iranian website; however, it is not one of the sites specified in the indictment.
Using a combination of technical and open source research, we identified another website,
Uniaccount[.]ir, that was used to sell the credentials compromised in the Silent Librarian
phishing attacks. The Uniaccount website is likely run by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named
in the recent indictment as a “prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the
Mabna Institute.”

On the Uniaccount website, credentials are offered for dozens of universities around the
world. Visitors are asked to send an email to a specified Gmail address to request the price
of a password for a specific university. Notably, the website also mentions that all accounts
that are purchased have a one-month warranty, so if the account is cut off during that period,
the purchaser will be given a new account to use.

In addition to

buying an account for a specific university, a visitor on Uniaccount can also simply purchase
research journal articles individually. The cost of a single article on Uniaccount is 2,000
Tomans, or approximately 60 U.S. cents. Ebooks and standards documents are also
advertised for sale on the site.

PhishLabs continues to collaborate with universities, law enforcement, and ISAC partners as
we discover more information about this group.
