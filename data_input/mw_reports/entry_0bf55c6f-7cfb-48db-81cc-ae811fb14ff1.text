Welcome
NCCIC

ICS-CERT

With the continued increase
in the frequency and
sophistication of cyber
threats against America’s
critical infrastructure (CI),
the National Cybersecurity
and Communications
Integration Center’s (NCCIC)
role as the Nation’s 24x7
cyber situational awareness,
incident response, and
management center grows
ever more important.

As time and technology
advance, and as Americans
increasingly rely on CI to
provide many important
services, the Industrial
Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team
(ICS-CERT) continues to
pursue its mission to reduce
cybersecurity risk to the
Nation’s CI.

In 2015, the NCCIC as a whole received 145,566 reports of
cybersecurity incidents. Also this year, because of NCCIC’s
central importance to the Department of Homeland
Security’s (DHS) cybersecurity mission, DHS Secretary Jeh
C. Johnson emphasized the focus upon the NCCIC within
the DHS structure. In January, President Barack Obama
visited the NCCIC watch floor in Arlington, Virginia, to
announce his proposal for new cybersecurity legislation.
In August, the NCCIC’s third and latest watch floor went
operational in Pensacola, Florida.
2015 was clearly a big year for the NCCIC. After the
President’s speech on the NCCIC watch floor in January, he
thanked NCCIC personnel for doing a great job and said,
“You are helping to keep the nation safe and secure.” I
agree. I am proud of the hard work and commitment of the
NCCIC team, and I am excited about the opportunity to play
a part in the important work they do. We look for ways to
be more effective every day, and we count on a continuing
dialogue with our partners in government, industry, and
the critical infrastructure community to inform that path to
effectiveness.
Sincerely,
John Felker, Director of Operations
NCCIC
Department of Homeland Security

In this 2015 Year in Review,
we look back on the accomplishments of ICS-CERT and
see continued growth and success. In May, ICS-CERT
was announced as runner-up for the 12th Annual U.S.
Government Information Security Leadership Awards
(GISLA) Community Awareness Award for its Action
Campaign to educate CI asset owners about the BlackEnergy
and Havex malware threat. This recognition exemplifies
the dedication of the ICS-CERT to protecting critical
infrastructure.
In FY 2015, ICS-CERT responded to 295 cyber incidents,
handled 486 vulnerabilities, performed in-depth analysis
on 175 malware samples, conducted 112 assessments,
released two new versions of the Cyber Security Evaluation
Tool (CSET®), upgraded the Virtual Learning Portal, hosted
multiple regional trainings around the country, and hosted
two successful Industrial Control Systems Joint Working
Group (ICSJWG) meetings in Washington, D.C., and
Savannah, Georgia.
As we review ICS-CERT’s work at the close of another
year, I am once again impressed with the ICS-CERT team
and proud of what they have accomplished. As we move
forward, ICS-CERT will continue to work toward its mission
and defend against whatever new cyber threats the year
2016 brings.
Best regards,
Marty Edwards, Director

NCCIC/ICS-CERT Introduction
The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National
Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)
is a 24x7 cyber situational awareness, incident response, and
management center that is a national nexus of cyber and
communications integration for the Federal Government,
intelligence community, and law enforcement. The NCCIC shares
information among public and private sector partners to build
awareness of vulnerabilities, incidents, and mitigations. The
NCCIC vision is a secure and resilient cyber and communications
infrastructure that supports homeland security, a vibrant
economy, and the health and safety of the American people.
The NCCIC mission is to reduce the likelihood and severity of
incidents that may significantly compromise the security and
resilience of the Nation’s critical information technology and
communications networks.
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team
(ICS-CERT) is one of NCCIC’s four branches. ICS-CERT’s mission
is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure (CI) by
strengthening control systems security and resilience through

public-private partnerships. The United States depends on CI
to support national defense, public health and safety, economic
vitality, and overarching societal well-being. Disruptions or
significant damage to CI could result in potentially catastrophic
and cascading consequences to the Nation. Presidential Policy
Directive-21 (PPD-21) identifies 16 CI sectors (see table below).
ICS-CERT works closely with government at all levels and the
private sector to coordinate and share capabilities, services,
and tools that help control systems owners and operators to
prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover
from cyber threats and incidents. ICS-CERT’s activities include
four operations functions and four risk reduction functions.
Operations functions include watch floor operations (Page 4),
incident response (Page 6), vulnerability coordination (Page 7),
and technical analysis (Page 8). Risk reduction functions include
cybersecurity assessments (Page 10), distribution of the Cyber
Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) (Page 11), training (Page 12),
and Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)
activities (Page 14).

The NCCIC vision is a secure and resilient cyber
and communications infrastructure that supports
homeland security, a vibrant economy, and the
health and safety of the American people.

FY 2015 Highlights and Accomplishments
• The President on the NCCIC Watch Floor: On January
13, 2015, the President of the United States visited
the NCCIC watch floor to discuss his proposal for new
cybersecurity legislation. In his 10-minute speech, the
President emphasized that cyber threats pose an enormous
challenge to the Nation and highlighted the need for
greater trust and information sharing and collaboration
between the government and the private sector.
• ICS-CERT Runner-up for Industry Award: In
May, ICS-CERT was announced as runner-up for the
12th Annual U.S. Government Information Security
Leadership Awards (GISLA) Community Awareness
Award. ICS-CERT received the runner-up GISLA award
for its Action Campaign to educate CI asset owners
about the BlackEnergy and Havex malware threat.
• Incident Response: In FY 2015, ICS-CERT responded
to 295 cyber incidents. This represented a 20 percent
increase over FY 2014. The Critical Manufacturing
Sector nearly doubled to a record 97 incidents,
becoming the leading sector for ICS-CERT in FY 2015.
The Energy Sector had the second most incidents with
46 incidents, and the Water and Wastewater Systems
Sector was third with 25.
• Vulnerability Coordination: ICS-CERT handled 486
vulnerabilities. The vulnerability coordination team also
reduced the average number of days to close a ticket
from 108 days in 2014 to 55 days in 2015 and closed
76 percent of tickets that have been open over 365 days.
• Assessments: ICS-CERT conducted 112 onsite
cybersecurity assessments across eight of the 16 CI
sectors in 22 states and Washington, D.C. Of these

112 assessments, 38 were CSET assessments, 46 were
Design Architecture Review (DAR) assessments, and 28
were Network Architecture Verification and Validation
(NAVV) assessments. In August, the assessments team
also released its annual report, “Industrial Control

NCCIC Arlington watch floor.

Watch Floor Operations
NCCIC’s watch floor operations are the primary entry point
for threat, vulnerability, and incident reporting, as well as
classified and unclassified information dissemination from
ICS-CERT to its stakeholders. Watch floor operations serve
as the operational “traffic cop” between stakeholders and
ICS-CERT by ingesting, triaging, and tracking incidents
to resolution. Approximately two dozen analysts and
incident handlers staff the NCCIC watch floor across three
geographically separate watch floor locations. NCCIC
maintains watch floor operations capabilities in Idaho
Falls, Idaho; Pensacola, Florida; and Arlington, Virginia. The
Pensacola watch floor is the newest, becoming operational
in August. Arlington watch floor operations are a physically
integrated component of and co-located with the primary
NCCIC watch floor, while Idaho Falls and Pensacola are
networked into NCCIC so that they can assume continuity of
operations responsibilities during emergencies.
NCCIC’s watch floor operations ensure proper operating
tempo, coordinating with other ICS-CERT and NCCIC
components, the law enforcement and intelligence
community, and other external partners. NCCIC’s watch
floor operations provide all aspects of incident response
4

services, including digital media analysis and onsite
response; recovery and mitigation support; vulnerability
coordination and disclosure; and situational awareness
alerts and advisories to warn of cyber threats affecting the
Nation’s CI.
ICS-CERT works closely with Information Sharing and
Analysis Centers (ISACs), researchers, vendors, SectorSpecific Agencies (SSAs), industry associations, and other
partners across the Nation’s 16 CI sectors to coordinate
cyber risk reduction efforts. In fact, it is these strong
partnerships with key stakeholders across all sectors and
government agencies that put ICS-CERT in the unique
position of providing clear situational awareness of the
threat landscape and associated defensive measures. Timely
and accurate information is essential to cybersecurity
preparedness.
Other core watch operations functions include providing
input for briefings to senior government officials; supporting
the cybersecurity common operational picture by providing
threat information and analysis inputs; and leading
operational information management processes, including
operation of ICS-CERT’s incident management system.

In FY 2015, ICS-CERT continued significant outreach efforts
to raise awareness of a sophisticated malware campaign that
has compromised several industrial control systems (ICS)
environments using a variant of the BlackEnergy malware,
named BlackEnergy2. This malware activity has been ongoing
since at least 2011, with the most recent activity observed in
late September 2014.
ICS-CERT conducted 6 webinars, 200 presentations,
and 136 teleconferences for stakeholders to help them
understand the threats to CI. At the request of stakeholders,
ICS-CERT published and distributed a presentation titled
“Current Risks to Industrial Control Systems.” Included
in the presentation was additional instruction specifically
intended to assist recipients in briefing their organization
with this information. The presentation is located in our
secure portal and was distributed to all SSAs and formally
recognized ISACs. The presentation is intended to be
shared within stakeholder organizations to raise awareness
for control system personnel, information technology
personnel, and up to C-Level executives (high-ranking
executives, e.g., CEOs, CFOs, COOs).
At this time, DHS has not identified any attempts to damage,
modify, or otherwise disrupt any of the BlackEnergy 2 victim
systems’ control processes. ICS-CERT has not been able to verify
if the intruders expanded access beyond the compromised
human-machine interface (HMI) into the underlying control

system, but the investigation is still ongoing. As of January
2016, open-source reports have circulated alleging that a
December 23, 2015, power outage in Ukraine was caused by
BlackEnergy Malware. ICS-CERT and US-CERT are working
with the Ukrainian CERT and our international partners to
analyze the malware and can confirm that a BlackEnergy 3
variant was present in the system. Based on the technical
artifacts ICS-CERT and US-CERT have been provided, we cannot
confirm a causal link between the power outage with the
presence of the malware.

Incident Response
Incident response is fundamental to ICS-CERT’s mission to
reduce risk to the Nation’s CI. The incident response team
responds to and helps mitigate cybersecurity incidents
impacting ICSs in each of the 16 CI sectors across the
United States. At the request of private industry asset
owners, ICS-CERT provides incident response services to
assess the extent of the compromise, identify the threat
actor’s techniques and tactics, and assist the asset owner to
develop strategies for mitigation, recovery, and improving
cyber defenses for the future.
ICS-CERT also collaborates with international and private
sector Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)
to share control systems-related security incidents and
mitigation measures. The coordination among these
partners provides ICS-CERT with a unique perspective
of the overall cyber risk landscape and emerging threats.
ICS-CERT conveys this information through outreach
activities, briefings, and information products, such as
alerts and advisories, as well as technical information papers
recommending strategies for improving cyber defense.
Every year, new malware families target ICS-specific
functionality, underscoring the evolving landscape and
the recognition by adversaries of high-stakes ICS targets.
ICS-CERT provides onsite incident response support,
conducts technical analysis of artifacts and malware,
develops mitigation strategies for owners and operators, and
provides configuration analysis on new systems to ensure
sufficient detection and prevention of the evolving threats.

Incident Response in FY 2015
In FY 2015, ICS-CERT received and responded to 295
incidents. The Critical Manufacturing Sector accounted for
97 of these incidents, while the Energy Sector had 46 and
the Water and Wastewater Systems Sector had 25. Spearphishing represented 37 percent of these incidents, making
it the leading access vector for FY 2015 incidents reported
to ICS-CERT. Network scanning and probing accounted for
11 percent of ICS-CERT’s FY 2015 incidents. Federal partners
were once again the leading reporting source for incidents.
They reported 179 incidents, which accounted for 61 percent
of FY 2015 incidents reported to ICS-CERT. Asset owners
were the second largest reporting source with 34 incidents,
accounting for 12 percent of incidents reported. Researchers
reported 30 incidents, accounting for 10 percent (see
Incident Response FY 2015 Metrics on Page 17).

Vulnerability Coordination
The primary objective of ICS-CERT’s vulnerability
coordination work is the timely mitigation of vulnerabilities
to reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber attack against
the Nation’s CI. Vulnerability coordination requires technical
expertise, documentation, and close trusted partnerships
with key ICS community stakeholders, including vendors;
manufacturers; integrators; CI owners; researchers; federal,
state, and local government organizations; and international
partners. ICS-CERT’s vulnerability handling process involves
five basic steps:
Detection/Collection. The vulnerability team collects
vulnerability reports through vulnerability analysis,
monitoring of public sources, and direct receipt of
vulnerability information. Upon learning of a vulnerability
or receiving a report, the team first eliminates duplicates
and false alarms and then catalogs each vulnerability.
Analysis. Once the vulnerabilities are catalogued, the
vulnerability team and vendor analysts work to understand
the vulnerabilities by examining and identifying the issues,
as well as the potential threat.
Mitigation Coordination. After analyzing a vulnerability, the team
works with the vendor for mitigation and patch issuance.
The vulnerability team works with vendors to allow
sufficient time to effectively resolve and perform patch
regression testing against any given vulnerability.

Disclosure. After coordinating with vendors and gathering
technical and threat information, the team takes the
appropriate steps to notify end users about vulnerabilities.
ICS-CERT strives to disclose accurate, neutral, objective
information, and will reference other available information
and correct misinformation when possible.

Vulnerability Coordination in FY 2015
In FY 2015, the ICS-CERT vulnerability coordination
team handled 486 vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT reduced the
average number of days to close a ticket from 108 days
in 2014 to 55 days in 2015 and closed 76 percent of
tickets that had been open over 365 days. The vulnerability
coordination team gave presentations on two high visibility
vulnerabilities at the DEF CON conference held in Las Vegas.
The presentations covered the Uconnect Jeep Fiat auto hack
and Hospira medical pumps. ICS-CERT released six alerts
as a result of its attendance at the DEF CON and Black Hat
conferences. The vulnerability team again saw an increase in
medical device vulnerabilities. Notably, the team successfully
coordinated the release of patches and advisories for
medical devices with Baxter, Hospira, and the Food and
Drug Administration.

Application of Mitigation. The vulnerability team works with
vendors to allow sufficient time for affected end users to
obtain, test, and apply mitigation strategies prior to disclosure.

Technical Analysis
The Advanced Analytical Laboratory (AAL) provides
technical analysis in support of ICS-CERT’s mission to
reduce risk to the Nation’s CI. Technical analysis includes
all aspects of malware analysis, digital analysis, reverse
engineering and longer-term analysis; exploring systemic
vulnerabilities and potential future threats, tactics,
techniques, and procedures; and more intractable long-term
problems.
The AAL also provides research and analysis capabilities
in support of the incident response, assessment, and
vulnerability coordination activities of ICS-CERT. The AAL’s
expert cybersecurity researchers can respond to cyber
incidents with both onsite and remote capacity. When
possible, analytical efforts are performed remotely in a
laboratory environment using custom tools and techniques.
In some cases, however, onsite analysis is required, and a
team is deployed to perform analytical efforts directly on
the owner’s network.

Technical Analysis in FY 2015
In FY 2015, the AAL performed in-depth analysis on 175
malware samples. This work helped uncover sophisticated
threat actor techniques and tactics and allowed ICS-CERT to

8

publish multiple alerts warning the ICS community of the
threat and provide information for detecting and mitigating
intrusion activity.
Also in FY 2015, the AAL continued to focus on automating
and streamlining the lab’s analytical capabilities. Initial
efforts have begun to shift the AAL’s output to a Structured
Threat Information Expression (STIX) based format. When
completed, this effort will allow the AAL to provide threat
information in an automated, machine-readable format that
will reduce the amount of time necessary to provide this
data to customers.

The AAL has continued work on the automation and
integration of forensic analysis tools in a suite called
the Analyst Network Tool (ANT). ANT brings together
custom and commercial forensic tools in an integrated
environment, allowing multiple drive images to be
processed simultaneously, reducing the amount of analyst
hands-on time. ANT has greatly reduced the turnaround
time for digital forensic analysis, providing faster results
to customers responding to a compromise. The AAL
has also begun adding additional capability to meet the
growing demand by our customers for our services. This
has included hiring additional staff, expanding the physical
space where we operate our laboratory, and both adding
and prototyping new tools.

Sandia National Laboratory
Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) performs year-round
research work and develops prototype tools on behalf of
the ICS-CERT. In addition, SNL assists the AAL with malware
analysis when requested. SNL’s recent efforts have been aimed
at developing tools and methods to examine firmware and
business logic on programmable logic controllers for signs of
tampering and to examine Modbus protocols on the network
for out-of-bounds conditions.

Air Force Institute of Technology
For the past five years, the Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) has conducted significant research efforts supporting
ICS-CERT. As a research-based graduate school, AFIT’s
contributions for FY 2015 include nine Masters students
and one PhD student working toward safer and more
reliable industrial control and automation systems. AFIT’s
highlights for FY 2015 include three journal articles
that investigate ICS honeypot development and wireless
defenses. Students also presented their work at the 9th
Annual International Conference on Critical Infrastructure
Protection. Current graduate research is advancing the fields
of ICS incident response, cyber insurance models, reverse
engineering, wireless vulnerability assessment, and the
development of ICS cyber range technology.

Assessments
As a core part of its mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s
CI, ICS-CERT provides onsite cybersecurity assessments to CI
asset owners and operators to strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of their ICS. ICS-CERT assessments are based on
standards, guidelines, and best practices and are provided
to CI asset owners and operators at no cost using our
Congressional funding. The assessment methodology
provides a structured framework that asset owners and
operators can use repeatedly to assess, re-assess, protect,
detect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their
ICS networks. The information gained from assessments also
provides stakeholders with the understanding and context
necessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for
enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
ICS-CERT’s onsite cybersecurity assessment services include
guided Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) assessments,
Design Architecture Review (DAR) assessments, and
Network Architecture Verification and Validation (NAVV)
assessments.
CSET is a stand-alone software tool used to conduct
cybersecurity assessments (see CSET section on Page 11.)
The DAR assessment provides ICS asset owners with a
comprehensive evaluation and discovery process, focusing
on defense strategies associated with an asset owner’s
specific control systems network. The DAR includes an
in-depth review and evaluation of the control system’s
network design, configuration, interdependencies, and its
10

applications. ICS-CERT provides a detailed DAR report, and
with expert consultation, positions the requesting facility’s
ICS for improved security and resiliency.
The NAVV assessment provides a sophisticated analysis of
network packet-data, which is collected by the asset owners
from within their control system network environment.
ICS-CERT passively analyzes the data using a combination
of open source and commercially available tools, and
develops detailed representation of the communications
flows and relationships between devices. The NAVV also
provides a practical method for asset owners to baseline the
deterministic network traffic occurring within the control
systems environment. In addition, the service offering
provides asset owners with a means to identify anomalous
and potentially suspicious communications sourced from,
or destined for, control systems assets.

Assessments in FY 2015
In FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted 112 onsite cybersecurity
assessments across eight of the 16 CI sectors in 22 states
and the District of Columbia. Of these 112 assessments, 38
were CSET assessments, 46 were DAR assessments, and 28
were NAVV assessments (see Assessment FY 2015 Metrics
on Page 18).

CSET®
The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) is a stand-alone
software tool that guides asset owners and operators
through a step-by-step process to analyze their ICS and
IT network security practices using many recognized
government and industry standards and recommendations.
CSET provides a systematic, disciplined, and repeatable
approach for evaluating an organization’s security posture.
ICS-CERT released two new versions of the CSET tool in
2015: CSET 6.2 in January, and CSET 7.0 in August.
CSET 6.2 introduced two new standards: 1) the Committee
on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 1253
(ICS), Security Categorization and Control Selection for
National Security Systems, Baseline Update; and 2) the
North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) Critical
Infrastructure Protection (CIP), Revision 5. Additional
enhancements included revisions to the network diagram
interface, the ability to model multiple services in a single
component on the diagram, Grass Marlin integration,
additional Department of Defense (DOD) identification
fields and export capabilities, and the addition of a new
Security Assurance Level determination wizard that allows
users to add special factors from the National Institute

of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication
800-60.
CSET 7.0 introduced three new standards: 1) the
Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2), Version
1.1; 2) DOD Instruction 8510.01, Risk Management
Framework (RMF) for DOD Information Technology (IT);
and 3) the National Institute of Standards and Technology
Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628 Volume 1, Revision
1, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity. Additional
enhancements included a complete redesign of the interface
for a more intuitive experience, increased use of tabbed
sections throughout the application, additional instructional
“landing pages” at each major step in the process,
consolidation of existing tabs on the diagram screen to
refine network drawing time, improved responsiveness
of the questions screen, the ability to support multiple
screen resolutions (including mobile and large resolution
capability), and encryption capability within CSET.
In FY 2015, ICS-CERT distributed 7,565 copies of CSET
in 120 countries. In addition to independent assessments,
CSET was used in 38 assessments performed by the
ICS-CERT assessment team.

ICS-CERT Training presented this course 12 times in FY 2015
and hosted 484 students.

As part of its mission to continually provide first-rate
response to reported cybersecurity incidents, ICS-CERT
conducted a job and task analysis for the NCCIC incident
handler job functions. Based on results from the analysis,
a new training program is being developed to incorporate
both onsite and remote incident response responsibilities.
In FY 2015, the Virtual Learning Portal (VLP) was upgraded.

ICS-CERT ICSJWG 2015 Spring Meeting.

Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group
ICS-CERT established the Industrial Control Systems Joint
Working Group (ICSJWG) to enhance collaboration
between ICS stakeholders and facilitate partnerships between
the Federal Government and private sector owners and
operators in all CI sectors. The working group is a principal
component of the Strategy for Securing Control Systems,
providing a coordination group for sharing information and
facilitating stakeholder efforts to manage cybersecurity risk.

networking and collaboration is what sets the ICSJWG
meetings apart from a mere conference with presentations.
ICSJWG members consistently give the face-to-face
meetings high ratings for their relevance and value to
members’ professional lives.

The more recently developed webinar series is a direct
result of feedback received from the ICSJWG membership.

2015 Spring Meeting
The ICSJWG 2015 Spring Meeting was held in Washington,
DC, on June 23-24 and brought together over 200
people, including asset owners and operators, government
professionals, vendors, systems integrators, and academic
professionals from around the globe. Key highlights from
the meeting included a Q&A session with Director Marty
Edwards and a classified threat briefing. The meeting also
covered a wide variety of topics in plenary presentations,

ICSJWG Webinars
FY 2015 Webinars included ICS-CERT focused information
sharing with restricted access due to the nature of the
briefing. During FY 2015, ICSJWG webinars covered various
topics, including the following:
• Action Campaign Briefing 4 (TLP:AMBER)
• A Call to Action: Current Risks to Industrial Control
Systems (TLP:AMBER)
• BlackEnergy and Havex Briefing for Partners
(TLP:AMBER)
• Protecting M2M Systems at the Edge.

Moving Forward
In 2016, ICS-CERT will continue to improve cybersecurity
capabilities and extend services in support of all ICS
stakeholders in the 16 CI sectors. ICS-CERT will continue
coordination efforts with industry and government partners
to mitigate cyber risks to CI through timely and effective
sharing of situational awareness information and focused
mitigation strategies.
To handle increased demand for onsite assessments,
ICS-CERT is hiring additional personnel and will pursue
more one-on-one engagements with CI asset owners on
the use of DARs and NAVVs and assist them in identifying
gaps and developing strategies for improving their defensive
posture. A new responsibility in 2016 is to assist federal
facilities with control systems assessments. Federal facilities
are becoming more aware of vulnerabilities and threat
vectors that can impact their control systems operations
similar to private sector CI facilities.
Other goals for 2016 include improving and expanding
ICS-CERT incident response technical teams and tools,
which will provide greater value during incident response
and assessment activities. We will continue to refine and
update training offerings that will allow CI asset owners
to better meet the demands of challenging and evolving
technical issues in control system security.

16

ICS-CERT will expand its presence in Pensacola beyond
watch operations to include incident response and site
assessment personnel. ICS-CERT will continue to hold
biannual ICSJWG meetings in 2016 as we continue our
public private partnership collaboration. Through our
interactions with asset owners, vendors, and researchers,
we receive many requests for more information about
our work, so we will provide a 2015 version of our site
assessment work similar to what we published for 2014.
In addition, we plan to develop vulnerability and incident
response reports with detailed information from our work
in 2015.
It is uncertain what new cybersecurity threats will emerge
in 2016, but ICS-CERT stands prepared to react quickly and
evolve to meet the challenge. We will continue our efforts
to help CI asset owners prevent attacks or mitigate their
harmful effects like we have for over a decade. We will make
our alerts and advisories more actionable with additional
information, e.g., Yara Rules and instructions for Yara use, to
further assist CI asset owners. In addition, we are looking to
improve the distribution of our information through newly
formed ISACs in oil and natural gas (ONG) and foresee the
development of additional Information Sharing and Analysis
Organizations (ISAOs) to share with the private sector. If you
have additional ideas about how we can better assist you in
your cybersecurity efforts, please email us at ics-cert@hq.dhs.
