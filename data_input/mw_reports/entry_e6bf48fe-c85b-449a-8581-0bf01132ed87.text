Editor’s Note: When many people think of the U.S. Secret Service, they picture the unruffled
agents who protect the president and other dignitaries. But the agency’s founding mission—
and one that it still carries out—is to safeguard the U.S. financial system from counterfeiting
and other crimes. Over the last few decades, many of those crimes have shifted online:
Hackers breach companies for financial information, sell stolen credit card numbers, encrypt
corporate data until a ransom is paid, and trick victims into wiring funds to scam accounts. As
a result, cybercrime has become the focus of much of the Secret Service’s work, and the
agency plays a key role in investigating a range of computer-related incidents.
The details of this work sometimes emerge in court cases and law enforcement actions.
Secret Service agents are often the ones who investigate and arrest high-profile hackers,
darknet vendors, and other perpetrators of computer-related crime. But much of their work
happens in the shadows, with undercover agents, million-dollar bounties, and other methods
that can sound like they’re lifted from the pages of a spy thriller.

Until recently, Richard LaTulip was one of the Secret Service’s special agents who went
undercover to better understand cybercriminals. On occasion, he would even befriend
hackers. “I opened the door and there on the other side was the target standing with a liter of
vodka… a gift from their home country,” he recalled. LaTulip, who left the agency in July to
join the private sector, opened up about his experiences at the Secret Service in a recent
interview with Recorded Future expert threat intelligence analyst Dmitry Smilyanets. The two
first met in 2012, when Smilyanets himself was interviewed by LaTulip in relation to his
involvement in a major data breach investigation. The interview below was conducted via
email, and has been lightly edited for clarity.
Dmitry Smilyanets: You recently retired and are now a civilian after 22 years of service
with the U.S. Secret Service. Do you miss your badge yet?
Richard LaTulip: When I reflect back and contemplate my career, I can honestly say it was
a rewarding and meaningful experience. Along the way, I was able to contribute at all levels,
gained a lot of invaluable knowledge, and traveled extensively. During this time period, I met
a wide range of people, professionally and privately. These opportunities left an impression
in my life and it was regardless of the length of time spent with these people. For example,
some I may only have spent hours with, others were moments in time, and still others whom
I now consider friends impacted my life because I learned from their experiences, gained an
understanding from their perspective, understood more about their cultures and this allowed
me the unique opportunity to grow as a person and to mature. Far too often we move
through life; experience unique things and forget to stop and truly appreciate the experience
and opportunity. This prepared me for the other adventures in my life I had yet to know or
understand or even knew were coming my way. During my career, I learned how to better
appreciate people, places, cultures, and countries. This has made me a better person and I
am forever thankful for this chance. But your question was do I already miss the badge? To
some degree, I will always miss the badge. Working as a special agent was a large part of
who I am and what I represented. However, because I was fortunate enough to be employed
by the U.S. Secret Service, I feel I can now take these experiences and share them with
others. This is a new page in a long novel, and I am looking forward to meeting new people
and continuing to grow and share.
DS: What were some of your most exciting experiences at the Secret Service? Which
were most challenging?

RL: My career spanned 25 years, but 22 years were with the U.S. Secret Service so as one
can imagine I had a lot of exciting experiences. But I can say the most exciting was working
the various cybercrime investigations and of course this included my time working on the
various underground online forums. From 2005 through approximately 2009, I worked online
as an undercover U.S. Secret Service agent who purported to be a buyer of stolen data. In
order to establish a level of credibility, I relied on the guidance of an informant. This informant
was and had been working in the underground community for a period of time and became
established within a specific group of online cybercriminals. The informant provided a level of
bona fides within the community and I was able to seize this opportunity and expand upon it.
The informant was by my side often, then not too much, and then at various points in time to
assist in the investigation, but we’ll come back to this later.
Working online as a cybercriminal by night and then a U.S. Secret Service agent by day
represented challenges that are not easy to explain. I had to translate the successes from
the online world to understandable and meaningful language to those who have not
experienced nor understood the challenges. In addition, and unlike what is seen at times in
the movies or TV, I was writing reports, recording evidence, documenting online

3/15

conversations, participating in conference calls with USSS headquarters representatives.
You know, all the nitty-gritty work that is not as glamorous but was required to ensure a
successful investigation and eventual successful prosecution.
Anyhow, the informant and I worked odd hours because the case was global. We needed to
match time zones and seize on the opportunities when others, the target of the investigation,
were online and working. Now talking online and creating rapport behind a computer
represented challenges but our goal was different. Our goal was to be the first investigation,
at that time, to take our online behind the computer undercover world, the digital world, and
turn this into real-world operations. We planned and designed the case so we would travel,
as needed, too far away destinations and meet face-to-face with those with whom I was
speaking to online on a regular basis. Obviously, this presented unique challenges—we
contemplated “the Who” to meet, “the where” to meet, and tempered this with “Where” we
were able to meet. The planning and preparing for this style of operation was exciting,
demoralizing, interesting, stressful, and rewarding all at the same time.
Because I was able to establish a positive relationship with the informant—one that, in my
opinion, was based on mutual respect and understanding of each other—I feel because I
gained the respect of the informant this translated to a higher level of devotion and more
energy was invested to meet the investigative goals. Again, we speak of challenges, on one
hand you have those that live in the world of law enforcement, those who chose an opposite
path than those in law enforcement, and then the rest of the world. So, if you were going to
be successful, you needed to have a unique personality, in order to bridge the gap between
the rest of the world and those who chose the other side of law enforcement. One needed to
establish a level of mutual respect. I will say not everyone is geared for this and to be able to
work between these worlds is not easy. But for me, I saw it differently. I saw everyone,
probably because of my fortitude to travel extensively, as good people—some just chose a
different direction, but still they are good people. Therefore, I did everything in my power to
never treat anyone differently or treat them in a way I would not want to be treated. For me,
this worked well because when I spoke with a member of law enforcement—U.S. or
International, a citizen or a “cybercriminal”—I treated them all with the same level of respect.
But where is this all going or where did it end within three months, we were able to arrange
the first International meetings which are a completely different and interesting story on their
own.
Now, I spoke about a lot of what I did but let’s not forget everything I did or accomplished
relied on the guidance, assistance, goodwill, hard work, and determination of my colleagues
in the USSS, other U.S. government agencies, and international partners. Without this
assistance and goodwill, I would not have been able to achieve this level of success.
However, what I described to you was the most exciting and challenging time in my career.

DS: You were not just a Special Agent—you were one of the most experienced in the
Service’s Cyber Intelligence Section. Can you please explain the significance of CIS?
What are the main differences between CIS and the Criminal Investigative Division?
RL: So, to understand the significance I should start by explaining the CID. In the U.S.
Secret Service, there are several different divisions, and CID is one of the divisions. CIS is
an investigative section within CID. Over time, CIS has gone through several name branding
changes. However, the assessment was that the USSS field offices had a lot of
responsibilities, management identified a gap, and determined the USSS needed a group of
dedicated professionals who either assist or manage the USSS’s most significant
investigations. From the beginning, management’s vision was that CIS will be reserved for
the USSS’s most accomplished investigators and specifically designed to investigate, locate,
identify, and arrest the advanced persistent threat. This same group of dedicated
professionals is not only tasked with managing significant investigations, but these agents
were also tasked with debriefing the arrested top-tiered cybercriminals, building relationships
with international partners, managing significant operations, act as liaisons with federal
prosecutors, working with federal, state, and local partners and ultimately crunch the data.
Reality is inside the data, and from the data is how the APT is eventually identified and
arrested. With this group focusing on top-tiered cybercriminals, they quickly established
themselves as subject matter experts. This elevated the status, added value, and over time
gained the respect from our partners specifically as it relates to investigative matters
performed by members from CIS. I spent just over three years at CIS, and during this time I
was fortunate enough to participate at all levels in a variety of significant investigations. This
provided opportunities to debrief a wide range of cybercriminals and liaison with our many
international partners. My knowledge expanded, interview techniques were sharpened, and
my analytical skills refined. With this additional experience, I again continued to progress and
gain a higher level of personal and professional growth. I believe this growth was key to help
solidify relationships, and guided me through some of the most interesting results and
experiences of that time.
DS: If you were the director of USSS, how would you improve the cyber intelligence
process and cybercrime investigations?
RL: This is an interesting question and one that is not easy to answer. To be Director of the
USSS’ would be challenging, rewarding, and an honor. The USSS has a long and prestigious
history. Along the way there have been some missteps, but the USSS learned from this and
ultimately became a better organization. When I think back on my career, I know the men
and women who served in the USSS take pride in their work, understand the magnitude of
the responsibility, know the importance of properly implementing the mission, represent the
organization with pride, and carry out its mission with honor. Ultimately, when we speak of
the USSS we must recognize this organization is charged with and required to successfully
manage two distinctly different missions. On one hand, we have the mission the USSS is
most known for: protection. This mission means the USSS is responsible to protect the U.S.

5/15

President, Vice President—current and former—those designated by the U.S. President, and
international heads of state while in the United States. When we speak of investigation within
the USSS, it is unique. I say this because we are ultimately an agency with two missions,
both of which are very important, and neither can be forgotten when we contemplate the
organization as a whole. Since the USSS has the responsibility of a dual mission, I believe
an approach that will holistically help the organization is to create three verticals: protection,
investigation, and support. Each vertical will have domains, but ideally protection and
investigations only focus on that specific mission. Protection, the larger of the verticals, along
with those who work within this vertical, only are assigned protective missions that support
the vertical. The agents would be regionally positioned, in fewer locations but located in the
larger cities. Ideally, these larger cities have regional airport hubs, which can lower travel
costs, and then the Agents work and travel from there to support the region.
The concept is the same for investigations, however the investigative vertical is smaller and
will have more postings in the U.S. Of course, the support vertical is just that—support. But
this will provide support for both the investigative and protective vertical. Another experience
I had during my career is the USSS statistically does not promote or seek out opinions of
personnel who devote their career to the investigative mission. I believe if verticals were
created, then those who work in those verticals will promote within the vertical. This will
assist in development as management will be more aligned to the concerns of an
investigative agent. Diversity was always a focus but, in my opinion, this rarely included a
difference of thought. To be truly diverse I would believe we need to have different positions,
experiences, and thoughts. I saw mostly that promotions focused mainly on a similar line of
thoughts. Again, this is just an opinion and frankly, some items are easier said than
implemented, but I truly believe to holistically move an organization forward we must include
more well-thought-out ideas which include at times a difference of thought. This, in turn, can
have a positive effect on an organization’s morale and for a period of time, the USSS
suffered a moral issue.
DS: I know one of the areas you investigated was Eastern-European hackers. If you
can, please share a couple of the more exciting stories from your undercover days.
What are some of the most important skills for successful undercover operatives
online?

debrief cybercriminals. Courtesy of Richard LaTulip.
RL: So, I have reflected on this over time and of course my thoughts change along with the
opinions. What is or were some of the most important skills that assisted me during my
undercover days? Was I successful because I was that believable? Was it my upbringing?
Was it luck? Or was it because I was social enough and experienced enough to be able to
straddle the line between being a special agent during the day and a cybercriminal during the
evening? Actually, it could have been one, two, a combination, or none of them. Bottom line,
this is historical because everything is different today. However, at that time, this was
something not so well known to law enforcement in general. Cybercrime as we think of it
today was much different during this time. Yes, a computer was involved, so you had the
technology. And of course online instant messaging was not new, but as widely distributed as
this technology is in today’s environment, the answer, at that time, was no.
So we looked for a skimmer, which was popular at the time but dangerous for those who
worked this type of criminal activity. I say dangerous because of how closely connected an
individual was to the stolen credit card data. But to now see in the wild people using full track
data that was compromised via a network intrusion? This was new to law enforcement, and
to be honest we had to get caught up. Luckily for everyone involved, the cybercriminal was
having just a difficult time. Can you imagine: “Hey world, I have just hacked a company and

7/15

stole full credit card track data. I am offering $5.00 per track. Anyone?” I recall in some of the
debriefs with hackers, them telling me how in the early days they were having trouble
vending the stolen data. People were not so trusting. Can you imagine? “Let me understand,
you want me to send money to I do not know who or where, oftentimes halfway around the
world to a city I never heard of and in exchange I will get full credit card track data? Yeah
right.” That was often the answer. Most people, during those initial days, were not trusting
hackers. So to counter, the hackers gave away data. The hacker received, as payment,
cigarettes, alcohol, or very insignificant amounts of money. This did not last long. When you
consider what is in the news today, one can now understand how far we have progressed
and imagine how much a hacker earns today.
So, going back to when I started and proposed undercover operations specifically to move
from the digital world, which was the most common type of undercover operation, and to
move that operation to the real world… This was not something most organizations were
contemplating, especially at a global level. I would say from the introduction—early 2000s—
to when we operated—mid-2000s—we knew more, understood the areas the cybercriminals
operated, so this operation was not a simple move into our “backyard.” In order to be
successful, we were getting on airplanes and going to far-off distant locations. This was a big
deal, not just for the USSS, but for everyone in law enforcement, and so we put our heads
together, thought about what we needed, and focused on the task at hand. Remember, this
was new to law enforcement. The USSS had a policy, but this policy was not designed for
international in-person real-life undercover operations. At that time, the USSS had no official
training program, so everything we did was going to be groundbreaking, exciting,
challenging, stressful, and extremely dangerous. We, in fact, heavily relied on our
international partners, and fortunately for me and those involved we had reliable, dedicated,
and trustworthy partners.
To set the stage we needed to brainstorm and answer all types of questions and come up
with answers. One of the bigger questions—please remember we were not always dealing
with individuals who had the highest set of morals—was related to the consumption of drugs.
For example, if offered, do I accept, take, and consume drugs? Well, this was easy for me, I
have never taken drugs, therefore I was not going to start today. But I needed to develop
rapport so this meant I could not be the first one to bed. So, I focused on other areas in order
to develop that required level of rapport. Understanding the cultures helped focus on the plan
of action. If the target was from an Asian culture, then we focused on gambling, eating, and
hanging at nightclubs. If the target was from a Western culture, then we focused on beaches,
eating, and hanging at nightclubs. Small difference, but one had to understand the audience.
Following that we needed to find that place in which the target wanted to go. This often
meant tropical resorts and those that can supply the typical things most cultures and people
would want. Gambling, girls, booze, bars, sandy beaches, warm weather, and clear clean
blue water. Sometimes you could not get everything on the list—but gambling, bars, good
food, and girls were a must, and easier to check off the list.

8/15

Now, this dovetails into an interesting side note. Of course, everyone wanted to go to tropical
resorts. I mean how many people are interested in going to some far-off destination and not
doing anything interesting? Well, some management started complaining and indicating why
we are always going on these types of operations. So as the relationships grew and were
becoming more popular, I was invited to a destination that was not a resort. More of a city
tour but not so popular with tourists. I thought to myself, excellent! Here is the opportunity to
show we are not only seeking what is considered by some as a government-paid holiday.
However, the response by the same who complained was now why would anyone go here
on a holiday. So, this message was clear—no way of winning, so let’s just keep focusing on
what works and go to the beach resorts.
In essence, I was running two parallel lives; these lives had to intersect at times, just so I
could keep everything straight in my own mind but reflect back on what I was just
mentioning. This will all make sense soon. On one of the operations, we decided to meet and
hang out at one of the beach resorts. Of course, nothing was running smoothly, and we were
waiting for the target’s arrival. Delays and timing were not matching to what was spoken or
planned for earlier in the planning stages. As you can imagine, some people were getting
nervous. Thoughts raced through some minds—maybe the operation was compromised or
maybe the target just decided, last minute, to not travel. Anything was possible, but then out
of nowhere a knock at the door. I opened the door and there on the other side was the target
standing with a liter of vodka. The vodka was a gift from their home country. This was not
expected, as I thought—really everyone thought—I would get an instant message or similar
type of notification. Regardless, none of that mattered, we were in play and moving.
Thankfully, we did not move too far, just to the lobby for a late dinner along with some drinks.
Finished with that, one thought was, “Ok, this is ending, everyone from the flight must be
tired and in need of some sleep.” Just as I thought this, there was an invitation to continue
drinking in the room. Who was I to say no? It can’t be me who goes to bed first, so off to the
target’s suite. This was not optimal, however it was a positive sign I was to be trusted. And
trust is the place we wanted to be specifically with this target. Once inside, it was right back
to a good conversation and drinks. This was going on now for a while and the minibar was
getting low, so it was on to stronger drinks. Regarding the conversation, it was my intention
to speak about new topics, old topics, and ensure we intertwined business into the
discussions. Anyhow, I was relating a personal story—of course, the names and locations
were changed but nonetheless still something that occurred in real life. The target keenly
listening to my story immediately understood it was not something that aligned with what I
spoke about online. So he called me out and challenged my story and asked why there was
a difference. At this point, one can say, I was uncovered and exposed. Remember as well
that it was late, we had more than one drink, and I was for the most part alone with the
target. Thinking quickly or being a magician of words could have been the difference
between success and failure. And failure was not an option. Another topic to consider, which
at times is beyond a person’s control, is nonverbal communication. What did I look like from
the target’s perspective? Was I sweating, twitching, or did my eye blink one too many times?
Moments may have seemed longer than they actually were, but then again we did have
9/15

more than one drink, so this all could have been normal. Regardless, in the end none of it
mattered. In retrospect, I was too quick to respond and everything I stated just resonated.
Everything I stated was the truth, plain and simple. I lied. To understand completely, the
online world is what you want it to be. Trust is as deep as all the 1s and 0s that make up the
internet. I can be what I want to be when I want to be it and how I want to be. So deeper than
mere words, “I lied” was the second stage of the conversation. The reason for the lie was
simple—we spoke online. Today we sit in front of each other and have an opportunity to
really know each other. The online world is filled with lies, and misstatements. This is real life
now, face-to-face. Now is the time to build real trust and understanding of each other.
Everything was true and the target knew it, participated in it, and understood it. So on to
more important items. More conversation drifted on into the night and early morning hours.
We watched the sun come up and after there was no more to drink it was off to bed. I think
this was when everyone decided it was time to work the other more hidden aspects of the
operation in shifts. No one was interested in staying up all night.
Now I know you asked for a few, but I will save the other stories for another time and place.
DS: Who are the top five cybercriminals on your list? Which hacking groups do you
think are the most dangerous currently?

cybersecurity and digital evidence collection class to the Bangladeshi police. Courtesy of
Richard LaTulip.
RL: I do not really prescribe to or have a “top five” cybercriminal list. I have seen and
experienced a lot to know that at any moment, any number of people can be today’s most
highly sophisticated and successful hacker. As you know, there are a lot of intelligent and at
times self-taught programmers, analysts, and cybersecurity penetration testers, and the list
goes on and on. Some have chosen to use these skills to ensure the internet is a safer place
for everyone. Others, for their own reason, have chosen a different path. I was fortunate
enough, during my career, to arrest and debrief some of whom we termed as the most
10/15

successful online cybercriminals. With this success, some believed we made an impact. And
to some extent, we did make an impact. These cases—and a lot I was not involved with in
any capacity—were impactful. However, I knew it was only a matter of time before any
cybercriminal’s position was filled by another cybercriminal. Also, the world is highly
competitive. Some want a level of fame and fortune, add in that today’s world is also
dependent on social media, which translates to status. This status is where some seek to be
confirmed and validated. Move from the open social media and dive deeper into the “dark
web” and we find forums. These forums have all types of members—some are legendary,
some are ok with being amongst the crowd, and then others want to become legendary.
When I was working online undercover, I thought most, not all, aligned with me, about the
forums. The forums were more or less social media websites but in another format.
What I just spoke about extends to criminal hacking groups—they are all potentially
dangerous. Hacking groups all have various levels of talented coders, programmers, or
support personnel. These groups have time on their side and can slowly examine networks,
find weaknesses, can leverage off-the-shelf penetration testing programs to assist in
exploitation, and eventually over time are successful. When I was working in law
enforcement, some took it personally; I never took this type of crime personally. They had
chosen their career path and I had chosen mine. Their job was to be successful and create
havoc online, exfiltrate something of value, and monetize the item of value. My job, at that
time, was to correlate the intrusion to the individual who I needed to identify, locate, and
arrest. As you know, this was without regard to where the person was located, so long as
they compromised or utilized infrastructure in the U.S Regardless, I enjoyed my career, and I
had a lot of success.
DS: What is your opinion of state-sponsored hackers and groups? How does the
Russian GRU and FSB recruit new talent, in your opinion? Do they run these recruits
or do they control them in other ways?
RL: I have many opinions about state-sponsored hackers or groups. However, I think
everyone has an opinion and most probably the answer is “it depends.” Regardless you can
be sure that talent is everywhere and just like in most nations, there are those who desire to
serve their respective countries. National pride is something I have seen interwoven into the
underground community. For example, when online one can sense an “Us-vs-Them”
ideology. Some will immediately think “us” means the online criminal community and “them”
most definitely can mean law enforcement, the corporate world, or other injustices, perceived
or real. However, this is not entirely what I am speaking about. The way some criminal actors
write—in the online posts, links to articles—one can feel at times the “us” is them and their
country and the “them” means most other countries. I gather from this information that to a
degree they believe they are serving their country. I have even read, from historical chats, of
online cybercriminals who claim by day to be hacking Western companies, but at night
receive direction and are working on campaign X or Y for their country. Ultimately, the pride
of the nation can be a method of recruitment.

11/15

Other recruitment methods can be very simple—for example, conducting investigations that
will cross paths with top-tier talent. I also know from experience top tier talent will
inadvertently post a “here I am” sign right on their homes. Not literally, but if you are from a
small village and typically are seen cruising around on public transportation or driving an
outdated vehicle, and then tomorrow everyone in the town sees you driving a brand-new
Mercedes, Porsche or BMW… Well, this attracts the attention of everyone in the town, which
includes those who work in security services. From here the next steps are not too difficult for
an inquisitive and well-trained investigator to understand something is afoot.
Regarding the direction of a new recruit, I would surmise the officer or agent provides
guidance, including over-the-shoulder direction. In addition, the person could be brought into
the larger group, including a place to work from and operational funding. It is not a secret that
oftentimes nation-state cybercriminal actors are well-funded and trained and—since the task
is mission-specific—patient.
DS: In your view, how sophisticated are ransomware operators and their affiliates?
RL: My opinion is they are very adaptive, are able to adjust tactics, and overcome various
obstacles. Yes of course you will have your one-offs, but overall the groups are very well
organized. All of this leads to one conclusion: Certain ransomware groups are sophisticated.
We have seen over time, referring to what I previously mentioned, an adjustment to tactics
and deployment methodologies. This transformation did not happen overnight. For example,
when ransomware was first deployed, it was encryption followed by a ransom demand. The
demand was preset and pretty much this was forwarded to any victim. This lasted for a
period of time, but the groups were successful, and they were successful at getting rather
handsome cryptocurrency payments. So, companies prepared for the possible ransomware
deployment cross-network. This assisted corporations specifically when the victim
corporation refused to pay the ransom demand. So, as the pendulum swings from one side
to the other this meant the advantage was to the corporation’s benefit. The ransomware
groups added a new fold that could not be so easily ignored. Groups started exfiltrating
corporate data followed by an encryption event and ransom demand. This demand usually
identified the theft of proprietary data, but as with before the demand was for a
predetermined amount of cryptocurrency. And the cat-and-mouse game continued as each
side postured and adjusted. In today’s environment, we are seeing specifically-crafted
ransom demands, a key indicator of pre-attack victim research. Also comes threats to
release or vend data to competitors, as well as the burning of infrastructure. Some
ransomware groups even have blogs where they name and shame the latest victims, provide
levels of decryption support and allow for “victim” feedback related to the successful
decryption of data. With their success, the techniques translate to other less sophisticated
groups entering the market. Inside the dark web community, the information is shared, which
includes profits. Profits other cybercriminals imagine or desire to have, and so they join the
already crowded field of ransomware. I even know of hacking groups changing the entire
business platform, switching the gears so-to-speak, and moving wholly to ransomware

12/15

deployment. Anyhow, this is not something to be ignored and corporations must account for
the potential compromise. Otherwise, when the music stops, the unprepared will be left with
very few options.

DS: You are currently working in cybersecurity for the private sector—does your
experience as a federal agent help you? What are the biggest threats to your industry,
and what will be your major focus in the new role? Are you prepared for the new
challenges?
RL: I spent a long time working for the government, almost exclusively conducting
investigations related to financial and computer crimes. Over my career, I worked undercover
targeting cybercriminals, investigated online cybercriminals, debriefed vendors of stolen data
or products, hackers, bot herders, and others, worked as a diplomat in Europe and in the
U.S. Secret Service’s Cyber Intelligence Section. I also participated in the U.S. Secret
Service’s critical systems protection program. Along the way, I picked up several advanced
certifications which include the ISC2 Certified Information Systems Security Professional
(CISSP) and ISACA’s Certified Information Security Manager (CISM). So, I feel I am
prepared for new challenges and look forward to them. I know I have a lot to still learn and
this is exciting for me. I feel when you stop learning, sit back, and relax you are already
13/15

missing the issues. Missing an issue can be the difference between successfully thwarting or
succumbing to a cybersecurity event. I also know part of my responsibility is to share my
experiences with industry leaders, provide the information that can be leveraged to make a
well-informed decision. As I have learned, providing the wrong information at the wrong time
leads to incorrect decisions. To be valuable, the information has to be timely, informative, and
relevant otherwise the information becomes useless. Our leaders need honest, at times
blunt, evaluations of the current state. Otherwise, decisions may not include a holistic
approach that positively affects the company. My new role or mission will be to support
business leaders and I know, as I explained, that my past experiences will be essential for
this success. In addition, I will say it does not matter where you work—the threat landscape
is applicable to all parts of the industry. Corporations that ignore or believe it will not happen
to them are simply ignoring the facts and the data. Whether working in the government or
private industry we must be serious, understand the adversaries, apply best practices,
incorporate defense-in-depth, and diligently review, analyze, and interpret the data. In the
data will be the artifacts and these artifacts tell the story to the analyst or forensic investigator
who then needs to dig deeper and interrogate the network.
DS: Tell me a secret.
RL: I should have been a cryptocurrency millionaire… I guess I need to give some context
for you to understand completely. While working undercover I was involved in, among other
things, moving money. This, of course, was used to purchase stolen data. And to move
money I used all types of methods, which included traditional—such as bank transfers—and
non-traditional methods—such as e-Gold, Liberty Reserve, or cryptocurrency. These were,
depending on the time period, the accepted forms of payment. But working in the
government meant this was extra work. I had to account for every dollar and how one day I
could be up and then the next day I was down. It was frustrating and time-consuming to say
the least. Anyhow, I participated in the community and the community was all-in when the
market shifted to cryptocurrency. So just like everyone online I positioned myself as a “true
believer” in cryptocurrency. Behind the scenes, I did not trust cryptocurrency. I had many
chances to invest and instead I did the opposite. I mean I was following the rise of
cryptocurrency, but I felt, “Where is the value? Where is this going? What coin do I buy?” And
so time got away and my trust or lack thereof did not change. Thus, as opposed to investing
a few thousand dollars, not much really, and get say 20 or 30 coins, I purchased none of
them. Not to mention probably many other opportunities to continue and purchase additional
coins. Anyhow, the cryptocurrency bus pulled up and asked me to get on board. I saw the
destination but, not being a true believer, I did not get on board. Today one can see the
record prices for cryptocurrencies, and I think back—I should have boarded that
cryptocurrency bus.
