Each month, the Intel team provides Red Canary customers with an analysis of trending,
emerging, or otherwise important threats that we’ve encountered in confirmed threat
detections, intelligence reporting, and elsewhere over the preceding month. We call this
report our “Intelligence Insights” and share a public version of it with the broader infosec
community.

Highlights
As we’ve done for the past few months, we again looked at the 10 most prevalent threats
encountered in the environments that Red Canary monitors. These prevalence rankings are
based on the number of unique customer environments in which we observed each threat.
Here’s how the numbers shook out for December 2021:

Observations on trending threats
For the fourth consecutive month, we have a new threat at the top of our prevalence
rankings. This time SocGholish made the ascent. The emergence of BLISTER malware as
a follow-on payload (more on that below) may be related to this rise, and the 1.8% of
customers affected is SocGholish’s high water mark for the year.
2/7

Cobalt Strike, a mainstay of the top five spots every month this year, curiously
dropped all the way down to the twelfth spot. Only ~0.5% of customers saw Cobalt
Strike detections in December, after 11 straight months of over 1% seeing Cobalt Strike,
with a peak of 3.2% of customers back in June. It remains to be seen if this represents a
shift in tooling or TTPs by adversaries, or if this was merely a holiday lull for both red
teamers and post-exploitation adversaries. In any case, Red Canary detection engineers
are maintaining a vigilant watch on these and other threats.
New Conficker detection analytic identifies old persistence. Speaking of expanded
detection coverage, you may have noticed Conficker, that years-old nuisance, creeping into
the bottom of our rankings. This is not a re-emergence of a new threat, but an artifact of
deploying a new detection analytic to shine a light on an old persistence technique hidden
in a dark, and often overlooked, corner. In most instances, the malicious DLL payload of
these Conficker cases was likely removed by antivirus long ago. However, the lingering
persistence mechanism attempting to launch those randomly named libraries tends to
languish in the labyrinth of the registry long after antivirus declares the threat removed.
Expanding detection coverage does not just uncover new and novel threats, it also adds
layers of defenses to ensure more complete and thorough clean-up of the closed out cases
of the past.
Accordingly, we can add Conficker to the compendium of older threats with worming
capabilities that are still finding their way into places they don’t belong. If you’re seeing
Conficker detections, one way to harden your attack surface is to ensure you’re running an
up-to-date OS. You may also want to consider disabling AutoRun and checking over those
firewall rules one last time, just to make sure you aren’t haunted by any residual Conficker
infections wandering about come the next holiday season.

Detection opportunity: Rundll32 executing with command lines consistent
with Conficker
process_ name == rundll32.exe
&&
command_line_contains == rundll32\.exe [a-z]{5,8}\.[a-z]{1,3},[a-z]{5,8}
Note: If you are having trouble getting this detection opportunity to work in your
environment, you may find additional success by focusing only on processes where
taskeng.exe or svchost.exe are the parents of rundll32 .

Adversaries find a juicy Log4j target in VMware Horizon

3/7

Since public disclosures of the Log4j vulnerabilities began on December 9, we’ve been
tracking threats that have exploited them. We realized the attack surface using Log4j was
huge, but in the first several weeks, the activity we observed consisted mostly of scanning,
testing, and coinminers.

Detection opportunity: PowerShell listing VMBlastSG service names
This analytic identifies PowerShell executing a command to return a list of service names
containing VMBlastSG . This may assist in identifying post-exploitation as described in this
excellent NHS alert, similar to the following, which invokes Get-WMIObject on
win32_service to return service names:
powershell -c "$path=gwmi win32_service|?{$.Name -like """VMBlastSG"""}|%
{$.PathName -replace '"""', '' -replace """nssm.exe""","""lib\absgworker.js"""}

process_name== powershell.exe
&&
command_line_contains == VMBlastSG
The nature of recently disclosed Log4j vulnerabilities may have contributed to the
volume and delayed timing of activity observed in the wild. One of the reasons we did
not observe a large volume of exploitation in the first few days may be that these
vulnerabilities are highly application-specific, depending on how Log4j is implemented in
them. This means an adversary could not have crafted a single exploit that would have had
a broad impact on many types of applications at once.
Toward late December and early January, however, we observed an uptick in
adversaries exploiting internet-facing VMware Horizon servers running versions
affected by the Log4J vulnerabilities. While we couldn’t attribute all activity to named
adversaries, we observed likely PROPHET SPIDER activity in one environment, and
patterns suggesting a potentially different adversary in other environments. Others in the
community, including the UK NHS and Microsoft, observed the same pattern of adversaries
targeting VMware Horizon. This supplements earlier reporting about Conti ransomware
operators exploiting VMware vCenter during lateral movement in an environment. When
viewed together, this reporting and our direct visibility suggests VMware Horizon is a top
choice for adversaries to narrow their Log4j targeting, likely because it is widely used and
often internet-facing. We recommend everyone using VMware Horizon immediately
apply updates and evaluate whether it needs to be internet-facing.

SocGholish causing BLISTERs?

4/7

In December, Elastic Security published research exposing BLISTER, a newly discovered
loader that may contain Cobalt Strike beacons or other remote access tools. This threat
evades static signatures by splicing malicious code into a legitimate Windows executable
while preserving most of the original executable’s structure and content. Elastic observed
BLISTER coming from malicious installers, and we observed a slightly different pattern:
SocGholish deploying BLISTER. In at least one instance in December, we observed
SocGholish deploying BLISTER, which deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon.
This development shows that adversaries are actively using multiple methods to
distribute BLISTER and its subsequent payloads. BLISTER itself is evasive, hindering
static analysis and detection rules.

Managing the increase in ManageEngine vulnerabilities
In December 2021, Red Canary observed activity associated with the likely exploitation of
vulnerabilities in two Zoho ManageEngine products: ADSelfService Plus and ServiceDesk
Plus. The FBI also reported in-the-wild exploitation of a vulnerability in a third
ManageEngine product, Desktop Central. Given the frequency with which vulnerabilities in
ManageEngine have been recently disclosed and the speed at which adversaries can
exploit these newly reported weaknesses, Red Canary focuses on identifying and detecting
post-exploitation behavior, and we recommend others do the same to identify malicious
activity, regardless of how adversaries accessed the environment.

Detection opportunity: Java.exe writing msiexec.exe to disk
process_name == java.exe
file_modification == msiexec.exe
ADSelfService Plus (CVE-2021-40539)
As noted previously in our December Intelligence Insights, we’ve consistently observed
operators dropping web shells and using keytool.exe , a Java utility, after exploiting what
appears to be CVE-2021-40539. Separately, in one incident response engagement, our
partner observed a ransomware attack after operators gained initial access via exploitation
of CVE-2021-40539.
ServiceDesk Plus (CVE-2021-44077)
We’ve also observed CVE-2021-44077, a vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus,
likely exploited to upload a malicious executable and conduct post-exploitation
reconnaissance. Behavior exploiting this vulnerability—in concert with a binary
masquerading as msiexec.exe —appears to overlap with the TiltedTemple campaign
recently reported by researchers at Palo Alto Unit 42.
5/7

Desktop Central (CVE-2021-44515)
The FBI released a FLASH notification detailing APT exploitation of a third ManageEngine
vulnerability, this time in a Desktop Central MSP server, part of ManageEngine’s Desktop
Central product. Following successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the FBI reported that
adversaries drop a web shell, conduct reconnaissance, and use BITSAdmin to download
additional tools.
Though Red Canary has not observed successful exploitation of this vulnerability first-hand,
credible reporting from CISA and the FBI highlights the risks associated with the follow-on
activity successful exploitation can enable. Tracking public reporting on vulnerabilities such
as CVE-2021-44515 allows us to add context to threats associated with common software
and tailor our detection coverage to cover tradecraft highlighted by other sources in the
community.
ManageEngine products are widely used among IT departments, presenting a large
attack surface for adversaries. Organizations using ManageEngine products in their
environment should update accordingly. Patches for all of the vulnerabilities listed here
have been released and are available via ManageEngine.
As always, the assessments in this report represent our best thinking based on our current
visibility. To this end, we welcome the receipt of conflicting or contradictory information on
these threats and acknowledge that our assessments are subject to change over time as
we incorporate new information. To submit additional information for consideration, please
