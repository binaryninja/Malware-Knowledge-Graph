In a certain month of 2013, during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key
domestic department, researchers from the Pangu Lab extracted a set of advanced
backdoors on the Linux platform, which used advanced covert channel behavior based on
TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding, and self-destruction design. In case of
failure to fully decrypt, It is further found that this backdoor needs the check code bound to
the host to run normally. Then the researchers cracked the check code and successfully ran
the backdoor. Judging from some behavioral functions, this is a top-tier APT backdoor, but
further investigation requires the attacker's asymmetric encrypted private key to activate the
remote control function. Based on the most common string "Bvp" in the sample and the
numerical value 0x47 used in the encryption algorithm, the team named the corresponding
malicious code "Bvp47" at the time.
In 2016 and 2017, “The Shadow Brokers” published two batches of hacking files claimed to
be used by "The Equation Group". In these hacking files, researchers form Pangu Lab found
the private key that can be used to remotely trigger the backdoor Bvp47. Therefor, It can be
concluded that Bvp47 is a hacker tool belonging to "The Equation Group".

Through further research, the researchers found that the multiple procedures and attack
operation manuals disclosed by "The Shadow Broker" are completely consistent with the
only identifier used in the NSA network attack platform operation manual [References 3 and
4] exposed by CIA analyst Snowden in the "Prism" incident in 2013.
In view of the US government's prosecution of Snowden on three charges of "spreading
national defense information without permission and deliberately spreading confidential
information", it can be determined that the documents published by "The Shadow Brokers"
are indeed NSA, which can fully prove that "The Equation Group" belongs to NSA, that is,
Bvp47 is the top-tier backdoor of NSA. Besides the files of "The Shadow Brokers" revealed
that the scope of victims exceeded 287 targets in 45 countries, including Russia, Japan,
Spain, Germany, Italy, etc. The attack lasted for over 10 years. Moreover, one victim in Japan
is used as a jump server for further attack.
Pangu Lab has a code named "Operation Telescreen" for several Bvp47 incidents.
Telescreen is a device imagined by British writer George Orwell in his novel "1984". It can be
used to remotely monitor the person or organization deploying the telescreen, and the
"thought police" can arbitrarily monitor the information and behavior of any telescreen.
The Equation Group is the world's leading cyber-attack group and is generally believed to be
affiliated with the National Security Agency of the United States. Judging from the attack
tools related to the organization, including Bvp47, Equation group is indeed a first-class
hacking group. The tool is well-designed, powerful, and widely adapted. Its network attack
capability equipped by 0day vulnerabilities was unstoppable, and its data acquisition under
covert control was with little effort. The Equation Group is in a dominant position in nationallevel cyberspace confrontation.
