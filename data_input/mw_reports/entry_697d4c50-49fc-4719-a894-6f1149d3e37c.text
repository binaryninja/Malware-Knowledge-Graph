Malware coders are advertising a new Android trojan that can be used for phishing banking
credentials, intercepting SMS messages, locking devices with a password (ransomware-like
behavior), and more.
The trojan's name is Exo Android Bot, or Exobot, and is being advertised and sold via
Jabber/XMPP spam, via hacking forums, Dark Web marketplaces, and even on the public
Internet via a dedicated website.
According to the information we were able to unearth, the trojan has been sold as early as
mid-June 2016, when its creator (or one of its creators) had opened a topic on a Russianspeaking hacking forum (image below).

Shortly after, a listing appeared on AlphaBay, the largest Dark Web marketplace for illegal
products.

In October, someone had also registered a domain on the public Internet, where he now
hosts a website, peddling the malware.

In November, we also came across Jabber/XMPP spam advertising Exo.

4/8

The trojan is currently sold at different prices, depending where you see an ad for it, but Exo
is rented out on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.
According to its creator(s), Exo is worth its price. First of all, Exo works on Android versions
4, 5, and 6. In some ads, it's also advertised as working on Android 7, but this may be just
false advertising, since not all listings advertise this feature.
Furthermore, crooks boast that the trojan doesn't need root access to work and that users
can't uninstall it manually, meaning they need to do a complete phone reflashing to get rid
of Exo.
Other features, taken from the AlphaBay listing are embedded below [original, unaltered
text]:
- SMS intercept (send the sms content to admin panel in real time. If is desired with jabber
notifications too, can be configured for a target or by sender phone numbers)

The same AlphaBay listing provides a short FAQ section, which also provides a hint on
Exo's origins [original, unaltered text] [text in bold]:

a vps/server root access to install frontend/proxy script

As you can see, the Exo author is providing a control panel for managing infected bots, but
which buyers can access only via a proxy client installed on their own servers. Below are
two GIFs depicting the Exo control panel, included in some of the ads.

6/8

Bleeping Computer reached out to one of the contacts listed in many of the ads, and we
stumbled upon a person that admitted he was only a reseller, meaning Exo already runs its
own affiliate system.
Bleeping Computer also reached out to Exo's creator(s), but we have not received any reply
at the time of publishing.
In the original hacking forum ad, Exo's creator had listed the times of day during which he
wanted to be contacted: "14:00 â€” 20:00 MSK". MSK stands for Moscow Time, which is a
pretty reliable (not definitive) clue on the hacker's location, taking into account the ad was
initially listed on a forum for Russian-speaking hackers.
Furthermore, Exo includes a feature that prevents the trojan from executing on devices from
users located in former Soviet states, and the US. This filter is likely there so the author
may avoid getting on the radar of Russian or US law enforcement agencies.
Bleeping Computer has reached out to several security providers and inquired about
campaigns distributing Exo, as to assess the status of this current malware family, either as
a marginal player or as an active threat.
