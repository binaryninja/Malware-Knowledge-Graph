Executive Summary
During the analysis of the xHunt campaign activities, we identified a Kuwait government
organization’s webpage used as an apparent watering hole. The webpage contained a
hidden image which was observed between June and December 2019, and referenced
domains associated with malicious activity conducted by the xHunt campaign operators.
We believe that the same threat actors involved in the Hisoka attack campaign compromised
and injected this HTML code into this website in an attempt to harvest credentials from the
website’s visitors; specifically, gathering account names and password hashes. While we

cannot confirm this, it is possible that the actors intended to crack these hashes to obtain the
visitor’s passwords or using the hashes gathered to carry out relay attacks to gain access to
additional systems.
If successful in harvesting account credentials, the compromised data has a plethora of uses
for the attackers and can allow them to breach an organization to steal sensitive information.
Furthermore, because they'd be using trusted credentials, it can allow attackers to go
undetected for long periods of time, enabling them to infiltrate other parts of an organization
and even implement backdoors, like RATs, to get back into a system even after being
removed. This can result in significant damage to an organization over a prolonged period of
time.
During this same timeframe, we observed an indication of DNS redirect activity on
infrastructure used by these same operators. The domains observed in redirect activity
primarily contained subdomains referencing an association with their organizational email
servers further implying an interest in user credential harvesting.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from this threat. Our
Threat Prevention Platform with WildFire detects activity associated with these threat groups
while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the URL filtering for malicious
and/or compromised domains that have been identified. AutoFocus customers can continue
to track xHunt Campaign activity by using the xHunt tag.

Use of Responder on Kuwait Government Website
During open-source research of the xHunt Campaign, we identified a website belonging to a
government organization in Kuwait referencing an image hosted on Hisoka associated
command and control (C2) infrastructure. Beginning in May 2019, the image referenced the
domain microsofte-update[.]com but changed to learn-service[.]com in December 2019. As
of January 2020, this image is no longer referenced on the webpage.
We analyzed the HTML code on this website, shown in Figures 1 and 2, in order to try and
better understand how this organization’s website would attempt to load an image from a
domain known to host a C2 server used for malicious activity. Figure 1 shows the webpage’s
attempt to load an image from the URI file:///\\microsofte-update[.]com\c$\. This URI does not
display to the website visitor due to the “visibility:hidden” style attribute. The URI uses the
“file” URI scheme with the fully qualified domain microsofte-update[.]com as the host and the
“c$” as the path to the image. We found this path particularly interesting, as the HTML would
attempt to load the “C:” drive file share as an image on the remote server. Logically, the
legitimate inclusion of this code does not make sense as the “C:” drive itself would not load
as an image. Figure 2 shows the December 2019 change in the URL hosting the image file,
however, the rest of the code remained the same.

We believe that the actors likely included this line of code in an attempt to passively harvest
account credentials in the form of NTLM hashes from the webpage’s visitors. Windowsbased machines can use NTLM hashes when authenticating with a server. It is possible that
when visiting the webpage containing this code, the user’s browser will attempt to load the
image by accessing the file share on the remote server. To access this remote file share,
Windows will perform an NTLM challenge-response authentication attempt. If the actorcontrolled server specified in the URI is configured to emulate the NTLM handshake and the
website’s visitor is on a local network that allows internal Windows networking protocols to
reach the actor controlled server, such as Server Message Block (SMB) and NetBIOS, then
the actors could capture NTLM hashes and other system information for that visitor. After
capturing the NTLM hashes, the actor could crack the hash to obtain the user’s password or
use the hash in a relay attack. This could also enable a full breach of an organization and
allow the attackers to go undetected for long periods of time.
To test this theory, we set up the Responder tool on a server in our lab and configured the
environment to have the domain microsofte-update[.]com resolve to the server. We then
visited the website from another system in our lab that had the HTML code injected and
observed the Responder tool gathering the domain name, user name, IP address and NTLM
hashes from the system on which we visited the website, as shown in Figure 3.

DNS Redirects
During the analysis of the Responder collection activity on the Kuwait organization’s
webpage, we observed an indication of DNS redirect activity in related infrastructure analysis
within AutoFocus. As shown in Figure 4 below, in May 2019, the domain belonging to an
organization within Kuwait began resolving to infrastructure within a netblock utilized by the
xHunt operators during that same timeframe.

Pivoting on this activity within RiskIQ PassiveTotal, we were able to identify an additional
Government organization in Kuwait with the same resolution change in April 2019.

Figure 5. RiskIQ PassiveTotal indication of DNS redirect activity
These changes led us to additional DNS Redirect infrastructure associated with the xHunt
activities. We were able to identify DNS redirect activity surrounding both the 2018 Sakabota
activity as well as the 2019 Hisoka activity. All redirects observed were associated with the
Kuwait government and private sector organizations. Figure 6 shows a sample timeline of
the activity where the top row shows the target organizations, the middle row shows the
infrastructure change and the bottom row shows the related xHunt domains.

Similar to the activities reported by FireEye, Crowdstrike, and Cisco Talos, we too observed
the creation of one or more Let’s Encrypt certificates created during the same time as the
changes in domain hosting, all of which contained the name of the redirected domain. It is
unknown whether or not the DNS redirects were successful in capturing visitor information.
This activity further led us to take a look at the infrastructure previously reported in DNS
redirect activities. We identified several interesting resolutions within the same IP range
although not a direct overlap with other xHunt infrastructure activities. One particular
resolution of interest is with the Sakabota related domain sakabota[.]com. This domain
resolved to the IP address 185.15.247[.]140 in September 2018. Between December 2017
and January 2018, this IP was used in DNS hijacking activities. We also noted both OilRig
and Chafer resolutions within these same IP ranges over varying timeframes. Many of the
redirected domains contained the subdomain mx, mail, or owa, indicating that these
operators were likely targeting mail credentials. These infrastructure similarities are shown in
the Appendix below.

Conclusion
The injected HTML code identified on the Kuwait organization’s website indicates a likely
attempt to harvest credentials from the website’s visitors; specifically, gathering account
names and password hashes. We believe that the same threat actors involved in the Hisoka
attack campaign conducted these activities.

Similarities in infrastructure utilized by cyber threat operators targeting the Middle East are
not new. Infrastructure has often been reused and even shared in the past. The overlaps in
DNS redirect activities with the xHunt Campaign and known threat operators show a
continued interest in this attack method within that region.
Our Threat Prevention Platform with WildFire detects activity associated with these threat
groups while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the URL filtering for
malicious and/or compromised domains that have been identified. AutoFocus customers can
continue to track xHunt Campaign activity by using the xHunt tag.
