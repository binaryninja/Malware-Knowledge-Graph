WIZARD SPIDER is an established, high-profile and sophisticated eCrime group, originally
known for the creation and operation of the TrickBot banking malware. This Russia-based
eCrime group originally began deploying TrickBot for the purpose of conducting financial
fraud in 2016, but has since evolved into a highly capable group with a diverse and potent
arsenal, including Ryuk, Conti and BazarLoader. Their toolset covers the entirety of the kill
chain, from delivery to post-exploitation tools and big game hunting (BGH) ransomware,
enabling them to conduct a wide range of criminal activities against enterprise environments.
WIZARD SPIDER has developed their tools over a number of years, and they continue to
evolve the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) needed to monetize their criminal
operations in an efficient and effective manner.
Over recent months, WIZARD SPIDER has demonstrated their resilience and dedication to
criminal operations by operating multiple ransomware families with differing modi operandi,
using TrickBot and BazarLoader to infiltrate victim environments and reacting to attempts to
stop them in their tracks. The group has made significant improvements to their arsenal

recently and has both developed new tools and modified existing ones. The key observations
covered below are based on CrowdStrike® Intelligence analysis of BazarLoader, Conti and
Ryuk operations.

TrickBot
TrickBot has remained a primary tool for WIZARD SPIDER and has grown to infect upward
of one million systems worldwide. TrickBot has played an integral part in enabling BGH
operations and poses a severe threat across all sectors and geographies. This has made
WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot malware an extremely prevalent and widely tracked target.
On September 21 and 22, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a non-standard
configuration file being distributed to victims infected with TrickBot. The configuration files
instructed infected hosts to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server address
0.0.0.1 on TCP port 1 . This action resulted in an unknown number of bots being
isolated from the TrickBot network and unreachable through the standard C2 channel.
This week, widespread public reporting has attributed this disruption attempt against TrickBot
to multiple cybersecurity vendors. The operation against the TrickBot network was
orchestrated to take down the botnet, thus reducing BGH infections by WIZARD SPIDER’s
Ryuk and Conti ransomware families, with an ultimate goal of protecting the forthcoming U.S.
elections from ransomware operations.
Since the disruption operation began on September 21, 2020, we have observed a definite
impact on the TrickBot network, with almost 10,000 unique downloads of the non-standard
configuration identified. However, in spite of this, TrickBot activity has returned to its usual
rapid pace, and the impact of the disruption operation was manifested as a short-term
setback for WIZARD SPIDER.

In a timely turn of events following a short break, MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet malware has
resumed spamming activity this week, and we have since observed MUMMY SPIDER
deploying TrickBot to Emotet-infected hosts. Downloaded TrickBot samples since October 14
have used group tags prefixed with mor — for example, mor131 . This is very likely an
attempt by TrickBot to replenish their victim base to offset any losses they may have
experienced as a result of the takedown attempt.

BazarLoader Takes to the Stage
In addition to the continuation of TrickBot activity, WIZARD SPIDER has increased their use
of the initial access tool BazarLoader, which is now being distributed in spam operations and
used as an additional infection vector to enable WIZARD SPIDER’s post-exploitation activity.
Newly identified BazarLoader spam runs consist of emails containing a link to a Google Docs
file (Figure 2). The Google Docs file commonly contains a link to the BazarLoader payload
hosted on an external site.

The spam emails are often business-related, with themes that reference purported phone
calls, meetings, customer complaints or employment termination. An example email is
provided in Figure 3.

BazarLoader (aka Kegtap) consists of a loader and a backdoor component. The loader is
responsible for installing and executing the backdoor element. The latest version of the
loader contains a large amount of string and code obfuscation, and it has been observed

4/8

utilizing a novel technique of mimicking legitimate software for persistence. CrowdStrike
technical analysis has specifically revealed the loader mimicking communications software
such as Softphone.
The backdoor component is capable of executing arbitrary payloads, batch and PowerShell
scripts, exfiltrating files from a victim, and terminating running processes. In addition to the
backdoor component, we have observed WIZARD SPIDER deploying and utilizing the
CobaltStrike post-exploitation framework.
In September 2020, the group distributed a PowerShell version of BazarLoader that contains
similar functionality to that of the executable version and is likely a pursuit to be compatible
with their extensive, PowerShell-friendly toolset.

Ryuk’s Return
Since September 2018, WIZARD SPIDER’s Ryuk ransomware has been the group’s most
lucrative operation for siphoning money from its victims through extortion. The U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has estimated that victims have paid over USD $61 million to
recover files encrypted by Ryuk. In March 2020, WIZARD SPIDER ceased deploying Ryuk
until mid-September.
From March to September 2020, WIZARD SPIDER did not cease operating but instead
switched to Conti ransomware. We first observed Conti being deployed in June 2020. It is
unknown why WIZARD SPIDER paused operating Ryuk, but it is likely they took a break
from their operations to reorganize and reevaluate their methodologies. It is also currently
unclear how WIZARD SPIDER intends to use both Conti and Ryuk. It is possible that Conti
and Ryuk may continue to be used simultaneously by WIZARD SPIDER, with either one
being deployed depending on particular characteristics of the victim organization. What is
clear is that WIZARD SPIDER is now running multiple ransomware operations.
From a code perspective, little has changed between Ryuk binaries compiled in March and
those compiled in September. The functionality has remained overall static since introducing
features for targeting hosts on a local area network (LAN). The most notable change to Ryuk
is the introduction of code obfuscation. The code obfuscations appear to be designed to slow
down the reverse engineering process by using anti-disassembly and code transformation
obfuscation techniques.
These obfuscation techniques are not as advanced as those observed in Conti and
BazarLoader. This is likely due to the age of the Ryuk code base and build process, which
dates back to the end of 2018. Conti and BazarLoader are newer WIZARD SPIDER projects
with obfuscation likely part of the build process. Ryuk’s code obfuscation appears to be
macro-based, with macros inserted at the start of a function or in-line.

Conti: New, Developing, Persistent
5/8

WIZARD SPIDER operations were notably reduced and sporadic during the first half of 2020,
but recent months have seen a resurgence of WIZARD SPIDER activity and the introduction
of Conti ransomware. In August 2020, the actor began using a data leak site (DLS) for Conti.
Conti has been continually improved by WIZARD SPIDER and has already been used to
compromise over 120 victim networks, with stolen data listed on the Conti DLS. Conti victims
span multiple sectors and geographies, the vast majority of which are based in North
America and Europe (Figure 4). This opportunistic targeting is indicative of WIZARD SPIDER
and wider ransomware operations.

Conti has been under active development throughout WIZARD SPIDER’s deployment of the
ransomware in BGH campaigns. Additional features, obfuscation techniques and code
changes are integrated on an almost weekly basis. In August 2020, Conti’s technique shifted
from fully encrypting files with AES-256 to a more strategic and efficient approach of
selectively encrypting files with the ChaCha stream cipher. Conti’s host discovery and
network share targeting functionality has also continued to evolve and is now comparable to
that of Ryuk’s.

6/8

WIZARD SPIDER’s ongoing development of Conti is equally focused on the evasion of
traditional, signature-based antivirus software and to hinder malware analysis efforts. Conti’s
utilization of compiler-based obfuscation techniques, such as ADVobfuscator, provide code
obfuscation when the ransomware’s source code is built. Portions of Conti’s source code are
restructured or rewritten regularly with the intention of avoiding detection and disrupting
automated malware analysis systems.

Outlook
The ultimate goal of the disruption operation against the TrickBot network was to impact and
prevent ransomware infections — however, Ryuk and Conti continue to be used in BGH
campaigns against organizations across multiple sectors and geographies. Over a dozen
confirmed WIZARD SPIDER ransomware cases have been identified since the disruption
began. While the valiant efforts of the cybersecurity teams involved in this complex operation
undoubtedly had a short-term impact on WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot network, the response
by the criminal actors has been swift, effective and efficient. TrickBot activity continues at a
progressive rate, BazarLoader is increasing in prevalence, and BGH ransomware operations
proceed as normal with Ryuk and Conti.
WIZARD SPIDER, with its diverse and effective toolset, has proven to be a highly capable
adversary and continues to be resilient, reactive and resolute as they continue to run their
formidable criminal enterprise. The resilience of advanced criminal threat actors like
WIZARD SPIDER make it increasingly important that we, as an industry, continue to fight
back. Any attempt to increase the cost for the criminals contributes to a more secure
cyberspace.
