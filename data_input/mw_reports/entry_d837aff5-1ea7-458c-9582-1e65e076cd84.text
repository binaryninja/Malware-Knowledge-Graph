CASE STUDY

Cobalt Strikes Out
Cisco Talos IR and SecureX team up with client to repel attack
In 2020, an employee at a publicly traded company with
more than $8 billion in revenue going through a merger and
acquisition downloaded a malicious document containing
the commodity banking trojan Qakbot. Unfortunately, the
host was configured to trust and enable macros on all Excel
documents on the internet. Therefore, there was no warning
of the macros’ existence before they were automatically
executed. Shortly after downloading the maldoc, a user
opened it and a macro attempted to download a payload
from an actor-controlled URL. It was saved to the victim
machine and executed using a legitimate Windows
component: rundll32.exe.
Shortly afterward, the adversary used PowerShell to
download penetration-testing tool Cobalt Strike onto the
victim machine. CTIR observed the adversary executing
multiple Cobalt Strike-encoded commands reaching out
to their command and control (C2) over ports 80, 443 and
8080. The adversary also engaged in some initial profiling
and system discovery, using PowerShell to enumerate
Domain Controllers on the domain, and the open-source
Active Directory profiling tool Bloodhound to identify users
and systems within the domain.
Shortly after Bloodhound was downloaded, a .JSON file
was created in a user’s Downloads folder, likely containing
the output of information about the users within the
domain from the Bloodhound execution. The adversaries
then dropped a Cobalt Strike executable on two Domain
Controllers and used open-source Active Directory profiling
tool ADFind to enumerate other hosts. Similar to the
Bloodhound .JSON output file, the adversary also directed
the output of their AdFind enumeration commands into a
.CSV file. The adversary later deleted this file.
Analysis of the Cobalt Strike beacons revealed they
were executed from the ADMIN$ share, such as “\
ADMIN$\9b0c536.exe,” suggesting this executable was
executed remotely from another system. One of the Cobalt
Strike payloads was also installed on a host as a service
and executed — additional evidence of the adversary’s
ability to execute payloads remotely.
CTIR observed the suspicious PowerShell activity in
their SecureX telemetry, and sent a notification to the

customer warning that the TTPs were consistent with
pre-ransomware activity. This alert contained the specific
hostname and indicators observed in SecureX that
indicated a Cobalt Strike beacon reaching out to a C2.
After notification, CTIR began forensic analysis focusing
on three key systems including patient zero and the two
compromised Domain Controllers. CTIR was given access
to the customer’s Cisco Secure Endpoint console to search
for malicious activity in the environment. CTIR then notified
the customer of the affected hosts which had activity
related to this incident. All of the affected hosts had already
been found and remediated by the customer’s team.
This customer had an existing IR Retainer with CTIR and
a strong relationship that was formed over extensive
pre-incident engagements and drills. Similar to the case
above, the customer’s alacrity in implementing CTIR
recommendations avoided a disastrous outcome. CTIR
recommendations included:

•

Reimaging the patient zero endpoint to a known good
image with up-to-date patches installed, placed on a
VLAN that cannot route to the infected VLAN to prevent
reinfection.

•

Credential reset, similar to the case above, to prevent
reinfection of affected hosts.

•

Issuing a Group Policy Object limiting macro execution
in Microsoft Office documents, which would prevent a
similar attack from leveraging that infection vector.

•

Instituting multi-factor authentication for all critical
services to prevent remote-based compromise and
post-compromise lateral movement.

•

Issuing a Group Policy Object limiting the use of Windows utilities, such as PowerShell PSExec and Remote
Desktop, to trusted accounts.

The collaborative, joint incident response between the
customer’s IR team and CTIR led to a quick containment
and full eradication of the active adversary in the
enterprise IT environment that had the capability to deploy
ransomware to complete actions on objective.
