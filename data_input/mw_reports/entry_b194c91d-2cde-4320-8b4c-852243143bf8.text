UpHelpers.exe is an information-stealing/reconnaissance tool disguised as a Naver One Time
Password, (OTP) generator app. Naver is a South Korean web portal that first debuted in 1999 and
offers a number of services.

The tool collects drive and directory information on the victim system through PowerShell, as well as
gathering system information using systeminfo.exe. The stolen system information is uploaded to a
C&C server.

High-Level Overview

Figure 1: Malware Flow
Upon execution, UpHelpers.exe drops three executables as seen in Figure 1. The
OTPGenerator.exe file is dropped into ~\AppData\Local\Temp. AWastUI.exe and rdpclipe.exe are
dropped into the created folder ~\AppData\Local\MICROS~1\Outlooka. Shortcut files of the previous
two files are dropped into the Startup folder to maintain persistence.
The computer name, username, and local IP are written to a file named nlashine.ini. Figure 2
provides an example of collected information after running the sample in a sandbox.
Upon execution, rdpclipe.exe ensures nlashine.ini is on the system, and if not, creates it.
Additionally, the file contains the ability to log keystrokes and write what was captured to
COMMA1UP_RKey.txt. The contents of the text file are written to a .dat file, and retrieved by the C2.

AWastUI.exe is responsible for collecting system data and communicating with the C2. After running
the systeminfo command, the output is saved in a PDF file titled SysInfo_UP_day_hour_min.
Next, a hardcoded PowerShell command enumerates the drives of the victim system. This
information is also written in the PDF file mentioned above.
powershell $dir = 'C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\MICROS~1\Outlooka\';$gps =
@('A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','H','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W
($gp in $gps){$drv = $gp + ':\';if([System.IO.Directory]::Exists($drv)){$path = $dir +
'\UP' + $gp;tree /f "$drv" | Out-File -Encoding default -FilePath $path -Width 5000;}
}

As can be seen in the above code block, the tree command is used to collect the directory structure
and folders within the C drive.

Network Indicators
The attacker infrastructure may have been taken down by the time I stumbled upon this sample as
no useful network information was found.
Running a strings tool of your choice does however provide a window into the threat actors’
infrastructure as well as URL paths to your blocklist.
The following network information was found throughout all the associated files:
/ESOK/up2.php
/ESOK/post2.php
/ESOK/dwn.php?downfname=
/ESOK/del2.php?delfname=

The above IP address belongs ASN AS40021 – CONTABO, Contabo Inc., and has ports 80, 443,
and 3389 open. Figure 3 lists the most recent domain resolutions identified by RiskIQ:

Conclusion
Although Naver is widely used in South Korea, the group’s brand has grown to a global audience.
The threat actor(s) is targeting data from specific individuals who would use this app. Possible
groups targeted could range from customer data to individuals affiliated with the
government/military.
It is likely the threat actor would decide his/her next move based on the information collected and
sent to the C2. I am unable to make a guess as to what follow-on infections there may be at this
time.
