Executive Summary
2018 was a year that has brought significant changes in the cyberthreat landscape. Those changes had as
source discrete developments in motives and tactics of the most important threat agent groups, namely
cyber-criminals and state-sponsored actors. Monetization motives have contributed to the appearance of
crypto-miners in the top 15 threats. State-sponsored activities have led to the assumption that there is a
shift towards reducing the use of complex malicious software and infrastructures and going towards low
profile social engineering attacks. These developments are the subject of this threat landscape report.
Developments have been achieved from the side of defenders too. Through the emergence of active
defence, threat agent profiling has led to a more efficient identification of attack practices and malicious
artefacts, leading thus to more efficient defence techniques and attribution rates. Initial successes
through the combination of cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) and traditional intelligence have been achieved.
This is a clear indication about the need to open cyberthreat intelligence to other related disciplines with
the aim to increase quality of assessments and attribution. Finally, defenders have increased the levels of
training to compensate skill shortage in the area of cyberthreat intelligence. The vivid interest of
stakeholders in such trainings is a clear indicator for their appetite in building capabilities and skills.
Recent political activities have underlined the emergence of various, quite novel developments in the
perceived role of cyberspace for society and national security. Cyber-diplomacy, cyber-defence and cyberwar regulation have dominated the headlines. These developments, when transposed to actions, are
expected to bring new requirements and new use cases for cyberthreat intelligence. Equally, through
these developments, existing structures and processes in the area of cyberspace governance will undergo
a considerable revision. These changes will affect international, European and Member States bodies. It is
expected that threat actors are going to adapt their activities towards these changes, affecting thus the
cyberthreat landscape in the years to come.
In summary, the main trends in the 2018’s cyberthreat landscape are:


Mail and phishing messages have become the primary malware infection vector.



Exploit Kits have lost their importance in the cyberthreat landscape.



Cryptominers have become an important monetization vector for cyber-criminals.



State-sponsored agents increasingly target banks by using attack-vectors utilised in cyber-crime.



Skill and capability building are the main focus of defenders. Public organisations struggle with staff
retention due to strong competition with industry in attracting cybersecurity talents.



The technical orientation of most cyberthreat intelligence produced is considered an obstacle towards
awareness raising at the level of security and executive management.



Cyberthreat intelligence needs to respond to increasingly automated attacks through novel
approaches to utilization of automated tools and skills.



The emergence of IoT environments will remain a concern due to missing protection mechanisms in
low-end IoT devices and services. The need for generic IoT protection architectures/good practices
will remain pressing.



The absence of cyberthreat intelligence solutions for low-capability organisations/end-users needs to
be addressed by vendors and governments.

All these trends are included in the content of the ENISA Threat Landscape 2018 (ETL 2018). Identified
open issues leverage on these trends and propose actions to be taken in the areas of policy, business and

07

research/education. They serve as recommendations and will be taken into account in the future
activities of ENISA and its stakeholders. An overview of identified points is as follows:
Policy Conclusions:


The EU will need to develop capabilities (human and technical) to address the needs for CTI
knowledge management. EU Member States are requested to introduce measures to increase its
independence from currently available CTI sources (mostly from outside the EU) and enhance the
quality of CTI by adding a European context.



As CTI is perceived as a public good, capabilities will be required to offer “baseline CTI” to all
interested organisations. EU governments and public administrations are requested to share
“baseline CTI”, covering sectorial and low-maturity needs of organizations.



Regulatory barriers to collect CTI exists and should be removed. Coordinated efforts among EU
Member States is required in the collection and analysis of CTI, as crucial activity in the
implementation of proper defence strategies.

Business conclusions


Businesses will need to work towards making CTI available to a large number of stakeholders, with
focus on the ones that lack technical knowledge. The security software industry needs to research and
develop solutions using automation and knowledge engineering, helping end-users and organizations
mitigating most of the low-end automated cyberthreats, with minimum human intervention.



Businesses will need to take into account emerging supply chain threats and risks. The technology
industry needs to introduce qualitative measures into its production processes, perform end-to-end
security assessments and adhere to certification schemes.



Businesses will need to bridge the gap in security knowledge among the operated services and endusers of the service. The consumption of CTI knowledge is a major step to achieve this goal.

Technical/research/educational conclusions


The ingestion of CTI knowledge needs to be enlarged to include accurate information on incidents and
information from related disciplines. CTI vendors and researchers have to find ways to enlarge the
scope of CTI, while reducing necessary manual activities.



CTI knowledge management needs to be the subject of standardisation efforts. Of particular
importance are the developments of standard vocabularies, standard attack repositories, automated
information collection methods and knowledge management processes.



Research needs to be conducted to better understand attack practices, malware evolution, malicious
infrastructure evolution and threat agent profiling. Advances in those areas may significantly reduce
exposure to cyberthreats and advance CTI practices.



Much more training offerings need to be developed in order to satisfy the current market needs in CTI
training.

In the last chapter of this document (see chapter 6), a number of important issues leading to the above
conclusions are mentioned, providing more elaborated conclusions. It is proposed to consider these
issues and identify their relevance by reflecting them to the own situation and elaborate on it accordingly.
The figure below summarizes the top 15 cyberthreats and trends in comparison to the landscape of 2017.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

1. Introduction
This is the 2018 version of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL 2018) yearly report. It is the seventh in a
series of ENISA reports analysing the state-of-the-art in cyberthreats based on open source material1. This
report is the result of a one-year long collection, analysis and assessment activity of cyberthreat related
information found in the public domain. Moreover, it captures experience gained through interactions
with experts during various ENISA events on the topic of Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI)16,19. The time span
of the ETL 2018 is ca. December 2017 to December 2018 and is referred to as the “reporting period”
throughout the report.
In essence, ETL 2018 has maintained the structure of the previous ETL2 by using the same template for the
description of the assessed cyberthreats.
As part of the annual improvement process, some adaptations have been applied to the ETL 2018. These
improvements, originated from discussions with internal/external experts, helped increasing the
efficiency in generating the report, collecting and disseminating the information and establishing better
coherence among a variety of ENISA materials on cyberthreats. As opposed to the ETL 2017, in 2018 these
advancements are merely content-oriented. Firstly, we included some work performed by ENISA in the
area of CTI Maturity Model. Secondly, the assessment of threats has been brought into a wider basis,
leveraging upon contributions of additional experts who have supported the information collection and
the assessment exercise.
An additional step in advancing ETL 2018 has been the inclusion of CTI knowledge obtained within related
ENISA events. Both the ENISA - FORTH Summer School and the ENISA event of CTI (CTI EU)3 have
delivered valuable insights into the trends governing current CTI state-of-the-art. This knowledge has
been integrated in this report by means of content related to CTI State-of-Play, the assessed cyberthreats
and the conclusions drawn.
The channels used for information collection, ENISA has used information provided by the MISP
platform4, by CERT-EU5 and by also using threat intelligence of the cyber-security portal CYjAX6, granted
as access pro bono to ENISA. Confidential information found in these platforms has been taken into
account in our analysis without any disclosure or reference to this material.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that in 2018 ENISA has advanced with an established liaison with the EU
agencies with cyber-security on the mandate. This involves the European Defence Agency (EDA), CERT-EU
and EC3. This has been implemented by means of discussions for a more enhanced cooperation among all

1

It is worth mentioning, that in this chapter some parts of the ETL 2017 text have been reused, in particular
regarding the sections policy context and target group. These two topics are considered mostly identical to the
previous landscapes. Some changes have been added to policy context to reflect recent developments in EU–
regulations.

four organisations, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding that has been signed in the
reporting period7.
The links to these institutions already existed at a working level. ENISA has a tight cooperation with CERTEU in the area of threat information. This is implemented by means of mutual reviews of cyberthreat
assessments, use of CERT-EU services and by intensive personal communication.
While with EC3 and EDA a working relationship already exists, this year cooperation in the area of CTI has
advanced with the ENISA CTI EU event that was commonly supported by all four institutions. In addition,
in 2018, ENISA has intensified its cooperation with the Commission services by engaging resources from
DG Connect and European Security and Defence College within its CTI EU event16.

Policy context
The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU8 underscores the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends
in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape contributes towards the achievement of objectives
formulated in this strategy, in particular by contributing to the identification of emerging trends in
cyberthreats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see 2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).
Moreover, the ENISA Regulation9 mentions the need to analyse current and emerging risks (and their
components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with
statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the
new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses to current and emerging
network and information security risks and threats”.
ETL 2018 also relates to the context of the NIS-Directive10, as it contributes towards the provision of
cyberthreat knowledge needed for various purposes defined in the NIS-Directive (e.g. article 69).
Moreover, it comprises a comprehensive overview of cyberthreats and as such, it is a decision support
tool for EU Member States used in various tasks in the process of building cybersecurity capabilities.
Of particular interest is, however, the important role of threat landscaping and threat intelligence within
the proposed new ENISA regulation/ ENISA mandate11. Article 7.7 foresees that “The Agency shall prepare
a regular EU Cybersecurity Technical Situation Report on incidents and threats based on open source
information, its own analysis, and reports shared by, among others: Member States' CSIRTs (on a
voluntary basis) or NIS Directive Single Points of Contact (in accordance with NIS Directive Article 14 (5));
European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol, CERT EU.”. ENISA’s work in the area of threat analysis (as
exemplified by this report) largely satisfies this requirement, while articles 9 and 10 states the role of
emerging cyberthreats, both to perform long-term analysis and feed research initiatives. Despite the fact
that this proposal may be modified during the review process, the role of threat analysis assigned by this
draft regulation is indicative for its future importance.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

Concluding the entire policy context with regard to cybersecurity, one has to mention an announcement
of the Commission services that puts all cybersecurity related initiatives in the context policy areas in the
EU space12. Besides repeating some of the policy documents mentioned above, this source touches upon
domains that are related to cybersecurity, thus underlying the importance of understanding the emerging
threat landscape. Of particular interest are the developments in the area of cyber defence, being one of
the most dynamic ones in the current and forthcoming Commission activities13.

Target audience
The information in this report has mainly strategic and tactical relevance14 of approximately one year. It is
directed at executives, security architects and security managers. Nonetheless, the information provided
is also of use by non-experts. For all these target groups, ENISA has developed a web application that will
facilitate the use of the ETL information.
Looking at the details provided by this report and ETL in general, one can distinguish between the
following information types and target groups:


The first part of the document found in chapter 2 is a description of the current state-of-play in
cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). It reflects discussions performed in 2018 with the ENISA Threat
Landscape Stakeholder Group (ETL SG) and within the ENISA event on Cyberthreat Intelligence in the
EU (CTI EU)16. This information targets security professionals or scholars interested in open/emerging
issues of CTI.



The top cyberthreats may find a wider group of potential stakeholders who are interested in
understanding the threat landscape in general or deepen their understanding to cover particular
threats and their aspects. Hence, decision makers, security architects, risk managers, auditors clearly
belong to the target group. Scholars and end-users who wish to be informed about the where-about
of various cyberthreats may find this material useful. Finally, ETL 2018 can be a useful tool for
professionals of any speciality who are interested in understanding the state-of-play in the area of
cyberthreats.

Besides the information on cyberthreats, ETL 2018 is offering an overview of the entire cybersecurity
threat “ecosystem”, by covering the relationships of various objects, such as threat agents, trends and
mitigation controls. These interconnections make up the context of cyberthreats and can be used in
various other activities, such as, any kind of security assessment, identification of protection needs or
categorization of assets.
Together with ETL 2018, interested readers may find a series of publications analysing cyberthreats based
on contemporary incidents. These reports are published as Cybersecurity Infonotes15, issued in a regular

2. Cyberthreat Intelligence and ETL
Cyberthreat Intelligence: State of Play
In 2018, Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI) has continued improving with regard to good practices, tools,
training courses and standards. These developments are the response to an increasing demand for
contextualized and actionable information about threats. Just as in 2017, large organisations continue to
be the main customer base for CTI. It is worth mentioning, that CTI has matured in concert with other
related cybersecurity disciplines, such as Security Operation Centres (SOC), threat hunting and Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM). Nevertheless, CTI experts worry about the differences
between cycles of cybersecurity related processes. In particular, syncing CTI with Incident Management,
Vulnerability Management and Risk management seems to be a necessity in order to keep the focus on
incidents that matter for the protection of respective “crown jewels”19.
Though higher maturity levels are gradually implemented in large organisations, experts argue about the
appropriateness of CTI in terms of a positive contribution to the enhancement of the level of defence16,17.
The main concerns here are the increasing technical nature of CTI, the variability between CTI and other
cybersecurity management disciplines in the organisation (e.g. Risk Management) and the potential
diversification of objectives among them. Shortage of CTI skills aggravates these deficiencies18. The
immense interest of experts in CTI trainings is a clear indicator of the market need for CTI trainings19.
Moreover, the adequacy of CTI for small and medium organisations is a valid concern within CTI experts.
Through the analysis of CTI publications20,21, but also through a series of consultations with experts, ENISA
has identified the following topics as a summary of current CTI state of play.
Some positive CTI developments:


Pretty good information collection of publicly available CTI: information collection engines and tools
exist, comprising of comprehensive collections in some cases grouped according various threat/attack
types22,23,24.



Good information sharing, especially for low confidentiality incidents/threats: there are already either
ad-hoc or established CTI information sharing networks25,26,27. Loosely coupled individuals and user
groups establish repositories with CTI information for the most common threats.



Sufficient training opportunities for most aspects of CTI: both professional and non-profit
organisations offer comprehensive trainings on CTI4,28,29. Although available trainings cover most of
the market needs, it seems that additional elements regarding the use of CTI towards non-technical
stakeholders are still necessary.



Good CTI practices with very comprehensive content: various state, academic and private
organisations have issued CTI good practices (CTI-related frameworks, e.g. MITRE ATT&CK
FRAMEWORK30, CTI maturity models31,32). The high degree of uptake of these good practices
manifested through references in publications and presentations.



Good support of tools at the collection and correlation levels, especially for operational CTI:
numerous tools (both commercial and open source) do exist that facilitate correlation of CTI feeds
and the identification of corrective actions to mitigate threats33.

Despite the positive developments in CTI, experts argue about several issues that are not optimally
settled. Areas where CTI could do better are:


Sharing of CTI information about higher confidentiality incidents: it has been argued, that CTI needs
yet to penetrate important areas of cybersecurity. In particular, the use of CTI in emergency response
has not been yet sufficiently addressed34. Examples on the use of CTI in the Commission blueprint on
Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises35, or the use of CTI in the area
of Industrial Control Systems36.



Legal requirements regarding actions during collection of CTI information (e.g. vulnerability
assessment): the legal frameworks for the collection of CTI needs to be further analysed. While in
some countries/sectors this matter is regulated37, in many others, collecting intelligence is considered
a crime, putting thus limitations to corresponding activities of white hat actors38,39. This issue is acute

as regards to all activities related to vulnerability management40 (e.g. penetration testing, brute force
attacks to running systems).


Better/accurate identification of operational environment (crown jewels): CTI should not only follow
technological trends. It needs to connect to business as early as possible41. Of particular importance is
the identification of “crown jewels” to be protected42. Albeit being a tedious task due to its dynamic
nature, asset identification introduce risks when threat-hunting/incident management activities lead
to the recognition of (mostly intangible) assets that for some reason (nefariously or unintentionally),
have been omitted from asset identification efforts.



Asynchronous cycles among cybersecurity disciplines: due to the inherent agility of CTI and related
disciplines (incident management, incident response, threat hunting, and vulnerability management),
it does not properly connect to enterprise risk management cycles41. It is necessary to interlink these
cycles in order to avoid a mismatch between these disciplines, to avoid diversified, technologycentred viewpoints2 and lose the benefit from its synergies.



Relevant CTI stakeholders need to be identified and integrated into CTI cycle: as it has already been
identified in previous points, this is one of the main concerns of CTI professionals for the time
being2,41. The solution seems to rely on better interaction with stakeholders during the requirements
analysis phase. Though this matter is not new in cybersecurity processes, it seems that it lags behind
the desired maturity. This might be a result of technology bias from cybersecurity experts and the
need for increased management attention.



Strategic CTI needs to be better communicated to business at a strategic level: CTI needs to adapt to
the vocabulary of business and strategy1. One step towards this goal is the use of standardised
terminology30 and its proper communication to the executive level.



CTI needs to be better interfaced to thematic areas: there is no one-size-fits-all CTI. CTI makes better
sense if targeted towards a particular thematic, business or IT components of an organisation. In
accordance with the mentioned areas, it becomes evident that CTI needs to be tailored to the
peculiarities of businesses and certainly to the dependencies of the “crown jewels” under protection.



Presentation, use and analytics of CTI reports need to be enhanced: not much effort has been
invested in making CTI available to a wider audience than the CTI team. This may require a style-guide
for CTI information depending on the audience it is directed to41. Main elements of such a style-guide
are visualisations, analytics and Bottom-Line Up First (BLUF)41. ENISA released this year a smart
cybersecurity search engine named Open-CSAM43. A tool developed aiming the continuous monitor of
sources, highlighting trending stories and news regarding cybersecurity threats, using artificial
intelligence (AI).



CTI Skill profiles and roles need to be developed and adapted to the CTI (maturity) model adopted: it
is a matter of fact that there is a skill shortage in CTI44. During the reporting period, some proposals

have been made including a combination of automated tools45,46 and more precise CTI skill profiles for
the various levels of CTI maturity levels. Although this proposal may lead to a better coverage of CTI
skills, existing CTI skill profile descriptions47 are not considering the requirements of various CTI
maturity levels (see also corresponding conclusion point in this chapter).


Interlink between intelligence and CTI: to date, most CTI good practices are based on technical issues
of information collection and analysis. Yet, in 2018, the relevance of CTI and traditional intelligence
has come to the forefront48. Experts argue that bridging these two disciplines will bring CTI closer to a
number of non-technical stakeholders, while at the same time, enhance the quality of assessments.



CTI to be understood as a function: CTI needs to depart from a purely technological discipline to be
rooted in the economic, geographic, regulatory, economic and strategic areas as a discrete function.
For this purpose, various roles of experts need to be defined aiming at the increase of visibility and
usability of CTI.

Concluding the state-of-play of CTI, we would like to mention a few topics that have been identified and
regard the necessity for a European engagement in this area. After a discussion with experts in the field, it
is considered that European businesses, Member States and organisations would need to initiate activities
for establishing the following CTI artefacts.


European raw data repositories: CTI is based on large amounts of collected information from
operational systems. An important tool already operating in this area is Shadowserver49. Despite the
major sponsorship from US companies, Shadowserver also collects European data. It is imperative for
Europe to develop similar information collection capacities in order to develop its autonomy in this
critical sector. Such capability will help resolving overseas geopolitical dependencies and will allow an
independent mobilization of this resource in cases of emergencies within the EU.



Leveraging on EU CTI capabilities (planning, collection, collation, analysis, evaluation, dissemination):
Europe needs to develop its’ own CTI capabilities to achieve an independent CTI knowledge base.
Once developed, these European CTI capabilities need to be included as a function in various
European initiatives that requires CTI feeds for the resolution of emergencies. This will include Law
Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), CSIRTs, Cyber Defence, European Research and crisis management
capabilities, just to mention a few.



CTI Maturity Model: together with national and international partners, a CTI maturity model needs to
be developed. Given the novelty of such activity, involved actors may contribute with their
requirements, views or experience, thus leading to a good practice guide that is actionable for a
variety of CTI needs. In the reporting period, ENISA worked on the development of such model
together with EU and US partners. The involvement of experts has been achieved through the
mobilization of members of the ENISA Threat Landscape Stakeholder group. A first overview of the
work conducted by ENISA is presented in the next chapter (see chapter 2.2).



Development of CTI skill profiles/roles according to maturity levels: it is necessary to define various
CTI roles and profiles50 and adapt them to the maturity model. A European activity in this area would

lead as a basis for relevant educational activities. This, in turn, would strengthen the European CTI job
market and would increase Europe’s independency on CTI resources.


CTI capabilities, CTI-as-a-Service (CaaS) for small and medium enterprises: Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) are the majority engaged in implementing IT systems, either directly or via supply
chains. Given their role in the digital economy, SMEs are an important recipient of CTI knowledge. Yet,
due to the absence of skills, CTI is barely consumed by this type of organisations. Novel models of CTI
using tools and automation need to be developed and implemented for this purpose. Potentially, the
results of existing Horizon 2020 projects could build a good basis for this effort51,52.



Promoting a CTI culture: CTI practitioners need to organize themselves as a community to promote a
“CTI culture” based on good practices, knowledge and experience sharing.

These and other topics have been debated in the ENISA CTI EU event, a CTI expert’s forum. Interested
individuals may find the event material in the corresponding web site16 and/or attend the event.

Cyberthreat Intelligence Maturity Model
The interest in CTI increased during the last five years, largely due to the need to have a better
understanding about threats, adversary’s behaviour, tools and techniques in anticipation of cyberattacks.
With the adoption of automated monitoring and response solutions (based on AI and ML), cybersecurity
professionals and decision makers are looking into new ways to prevent potential attacks. Part of the
solution is to obtain data and information that allows them to analyse and investigate the intention,
behaviour, tools, tactics and techniques of adversaries shifting from reactive to a proactive defence
strategy. The answer is to implement a CTI Program within the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the core
elements and its interdependencies in a CTI Program.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

A Cyberthreat Intelligence Program covers the implementation of a Process and Capabilities
aiming at the continuous production of relevant, contextualized and actionable information, in
support of the organizations’ ability to prevent cyberattacks.
The Objectives of a CTI Program are:
Promote resilience to
cyber security threats.

Mitigate the risks from cyber
security threats.

Promote a culture of awareness
over cyber security threats.

By implementing such a program, the organization realizes a number of significant benefits, including:
•

Proactive identification of threats in the environment;

•

Increased efficiency of security and technical resources;

•

Improved communication of threats with sectorial, business and geographical context;

•

Increased capability for disseminating cyberthreat intelligence;

•

Improve communications with business Executives;

The expectation around the results produced by the CTI Program will ultimately depend on the how the
program is planned, managed and evaluated. Much of the success in reaching the objectives will rely on
the governance model adopted during the first steps of the program. The following list captures some of
the core elements required to implement a CTI Program.


The Stakeholders ultimately define what is expected from a CTI Program. A CTI Program to be
effective requires the alignment of information needs from stakeholders with the reality of the threat
landscape and the business context. The critical success factors rely on the capture of internal needs,
aligned with the ones from key stakeholders, to build people, process and technology that is fit for
purpose.



To implement a CTI program, the appointment of a Team is required. The size of the team depends
on the scope of the Program, requirements from stakeholders and resources available in the
organization to produces CTI. In smaller organizations, security related activities are typically
performed by someone from the ICT team, an outsourced company (e.g. cloud- based or service
provider) or an information security officer. In this situation, a program manager should be appointed
to interface with the various technical and non-technical stakeholders, identify the requirements and
assess the resources required. In larger organizations, the CTI Program team typically remains within
the Security Operation Center (SOC) under the Security Management Team. Considering the CTI
Program as a function, separate from the purely technical disciplines, positions the CTI Program Team
closer to business and the risk management as a discrete function.



The Scope of the Program refers to the various elements that may affect the production of CTI. The
definition of the scope helps the CTI Program Team to select the sources, collect the information and
analyse it in context to the needs of the organization and its operating environment. Examples of
technical infrastructure, future adoption of technology, policy, business strategy, among others are
strong candidates to outline the scope of the program.



The Outcomes of a CTI Program are dependent on the scope and stakeholders intelligence
requirements, classified into four categories: strategic, operational, technical and tactical. Strategic

19

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

CTI is considered high-level information, consumed by senior management of an organization.
Operational CTI is relevant to the work of security staff such as defenders, penetration testers and
incident responders. Technical CTI typically feeds the ICT staff to adjust the monitoring systems with
security configuration requirements. Tactical CTI is often referred to as Tactics, Techniques and
Procedures (TTPs) produced internally or obtained from external sources.


The Process progresses through five clearly defined steps. The first step establishes the governance
structure of the program. The following steps include the collection, processing and analysis of data
and information from various sources. The last steps focus on the evaluation, sharing and distribution
of the CTI produced.



The Capabilities required for the implementation of the Program are multiple and include the
management of stakeholders, scope, requirements, sources of information, ingestion of structured
and unstructured data and information, production, evaluation and dissemination of CTI. Not all
organizations possess the resources and organizational structure required to implement a complete
CTI Program. In this case, the decision might be to narrow the scope and requirements or to
outsource some of the capabilities. In any case, the aforementioned objectives are still valid.



Each capability requires the execution of Activities with well-defined inputs, processing and outputs.
Certain activities can be supported by systems - more automated solutions based in software - or
manual procedure - less automated. The option to adopt a system or a manual procedure depends on
the workload and resources available to the CTI program.

A CTI Maturity Model helps in evaluating the state of play of the Program within an organization. The
model here proposed evaluates the process and each capability required to achieve the expected
outcomes.
The following fourteen questions try to ascertain whether certain preconditions are met in the
implementation of a CTI Program.
1. Is the CTI Program known internally to the organization?
2. Are the CTI Program objectives clearly defined and aligned with those of the organization?
3. Does a process exists to identify and maintain information from relevant stakeholders?
4. Does a process exists, to register and/or maintain stakeholders’ priorities and intelligence
requirements?
5. Does the information about systems, digital assets and critical information exists and is accessible to
the CTI Program team?
6. Is there an assessment and planning of resources required for the implementation of the CTI
Program?
7. Does the CTI Program team has access to the organization’s security information and event
management data?
8. Does a clearly defined process exists for collecting structured and unstructured threat data and
information?
9. Does an internal repository for threat data and information collected exists?
10. Does the CTI Program team uses threat analysis and modelling techniques to produce CTI?
11. Does the organization has an internal/external CTI dissemination policy?
12. Does a process exists to support and manage the internal and external dissemination of CTI?

20

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

13. Does an independent process of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of CTI exists?
14. Is there a clearly defined process of continuous learning and improvement, leading to proactive
response to threats?
From the answers obtained, it will be possible to identify the level of maturity of each capability and the
general state of the CTI Program. The maturity model considers four levels of evaluation:
•

Initial - An initial level, where the process is informal and information is generated in an unpredictable
and reactive manner. There is no internal knowledge of the Program and no expectation or value
drawn. CTI is generated based on external information provided by third parties, particularly through
alerts from specialized press or security vendors alerts.

•

Managed - A more advanced level, with greater control over the management of the program. A
process involving stakeholders is established to discuss and agree on their expectations and
intelligence requirements, although CTI is sporadically used. At this level, data (IoCs mainly) and
information is collected from internal sources into a single repository, and later enriched with
external information. An internal sharing process is established mainly based on distribution lists.

•

Repeatable - With greater management control, the next level considers the qualitative and
quantitative evaluation of the results obtained, ensuring that these are aligned with those of the
organization and its stakeholders. Recommendations and course of actions (CoA) are produced based
on analytical models through the association, correlation of data and information about motives,
capabilities, targets and behaviour of adversaries. CTI is integrated automatically into stakeholders
systems and processes.

•

Optimized - The last level considers the constant improvement of the Program with the main focus on
learning and optimization. The program success results from the collaboration and effort from all
stakeholders and the CTI program team. CTI is recurrently used by all the stakeholders for decisionmaking and action.

The following table maps the evaluation criteria defined to the levels and capabilities of the maturity
model.

3. Top Cyberthreats
The fifteen Top Cyberthreats reviewed in this year’s edition of the ETL results from the analysis of
information collected throughout the reporting period. The information collected - mainly from publicly
available sources (Open source intelligence - OSINT) and some other references from commercial
providers - covers the majority of the most remarkable events and developments relevant to the study of
the top cyberthreats. However, ENISA does not claim exhaustiveness of the topics from the information
collected53.
Continuing the trend from previous years, incidents and advancements in defence and attack tactics have
increased in the reporting period. Among the many interesting developments in 2018, ransomware and
cryptocurrency attacks have dominated the threat landscape. A further remarkable development is the
massive increase in the number of phishing/spear phishing attacks: it has now covered the gaps created
by lawful takedowns of malicious infrastructure components such as botnets and exploit kits, while the
role of the latter has been significantly downgraded. The success of these methods is manifested by the
new record in data breaches reported in 2018.
Reference to the tight cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA permanent stakeholders group and CYjAX
Intelligence Portal (access provide pro-bono) manifested in the support provided during the collection
process for this research. Moreover, malware information has been taken into account through the
malware information sharing platform MISP54. Though the information taken into account contained
some classified information, this material has not been disclosed. It has just been taken into account
during the analysis process, e.g. in the validation of performed assessments.
The presentation of the fifteen top cyberthreats follows the same structure defined for last year’s ETL.
The following list presents the structure of the ETL description template:


a short description of the cyberthreat as it has manifested during the reporting period;



a list of interesting points with remarkable observations for this cyberthreat;



trends and main statistics including geographical information, when relevant;



top incidents within this threat category;



specific attack vectors used to launch this threat;



specific mitigation actions;



kill chain for this cyberthreat and



authoritative references;

It is worth mentioning that the above elements might change depending on the findings and nature of
each threat. Under certain conditions, kill-chains and mitigation actions (vectors) have been reused from
previous ETL reports, adapted accordingly, with new evidence as deemed necessary.

53

Due to the surging number of information on cyber-security incidents and threats and the limited available
resources, it is likely that many articles, reports, white papers, etc. have escaped our attention. It may also be the
case that missing reports have been intentionally left out from our references because they had significant overlaps
with used references.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

The fifteen top threats assessed reflect the dominance of the landscape during the reporting period. The
list presents one new entry and relevant changes in the ranking. The changes reflect the incidence of
threats throughout the reporting period. Some interesting observations regarding the researched
cyberthreats and their ranking are as follows:


It is considered that data breaches and identity theft are not typical cyberthreats. Rather, they are
consequences of successful threats (i.e. actions on objectives, if formulated according to the killchain). In other words, in order to breach information, one has to successfully launch one or some of
the other cyberthreats addressed in this chapter. As such, data breach and identity theft are
maintained in our top list because they are found throughout the analysed material.



Some of the 15 cyberthreats belong to same distinct threat category. Hence, they represent instances
from 12 threat types, according to the threat taxonomy used55. Ransomware, for example, is a
specialization of the threat type malware. Therefore, all malware protection measures must apply
with additional measures that are specific for this threat, i.e. in this case ransomware. The same is
true for Identity Theft that is a special category of Data Breach. Nonetheless, it is handled separately
because this threat is launched by special malicious artefacts.



Cyber espionage is more a motive than a cyberthreat. It has been maintained mainly because it unites
almost all of the other cyberthreats in addition to some high-capability threats that are specially
crafted by state-sponsored organisations, such as advanced hacking tools, vulnerability discovery and
combination of military/law enforcement intelligence methods.



The ranking in the list is indicative. The position is based on the number of incidents, impact and role
played for other cyberthreats in the landscape. It was not considered the possibility of cyberthreats
sharing the same position in the ranking. This leads to the interesting situation where - although a
threat increases - it is being ranked lower just because another cyberthreat has been ranked higher,
impacting thus the ranking of the ones below.

A web-based tool is available for consultation of the findings from each multiannual ETL report. The tool
provides interactive and detailed cyberthreat information in a quicker and more efficient manner,
allowing a better and more intuitive use of the ETL report.

Malware
3.1.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Malware is the most frequently encountered cyberthreat and somehow involved in 30% of all data breach
incidents reported334. During the reporting period, there are no evidences of a global malware outbreak
similar to the ones that happened during 2017 (i.e. WannaCry and Petya). We have observed, though, the
malware landscape evolved and malware authors are adjusting their TTPs in order to maximize their
profits and effectiveness rates. Notable observations include the shift from ransomware to cryptojacking,
the blurred lines between cyber criminals and cyber espionage actors, the high effectiveness of fileless
attack techniques, the decline of exploit kits resulting in increased difficulty of delivering malware as well
as the growing mobile threat landscape.

3.1.2 Interesting points


Advances in Command and Control (C2) communication. The use of encrypted C2 communication
has increased by 300% during the reporting period193, a development that creates challenges for the
blue teams (especially the ones that have not implemented TLS interception56). Moreover, the (ab)use
of legitimate encrypted channels is also growing, making the threat detection even more difficult as
domain and certificate intelligence are useless193. The percentage of malware samples that used
legitimate C2 services increased from 4% in 2008 to 9% in 201659. Finally, an emerging trend for C2
infrastructure is the use of blockchain technology that is decentralised and difficult to take down57. It
is expected that threat actors will continue (ab)using encrypted legitimate channels for C2
communication, while the use of blockchain technology is expected to be leveraged (not widely
though) by cyber criminals58,59.



Malware authors increasingly targeting IoT devices. One of the noteworthy events of 2018 was the
VPNFilter malware60,61,62 campaign. VPNFilter is a multi-stage malware that targeted home and small
office routers and NAS devices. At the time of writing, it has compromised around 500.000 devices
worldwide and thus created a huge anonymisation network for its creators409. Just like what

happened with Mirai63, it is expected that VPNFilter malware will create copycats427 , aligned with the
volumes of attacks and vulnerabilities related to router and IoT devices during 201864,65,66,67.


The blurred lines between nation state actors and cyber criminals68. It has been always the case that
cyber criminals follow and adopt TTPs used by nation state actors. During the reporting period, it has
been observed that lines between actors are blurring and cyber criminals adopt advanced TTPs used
by nation state actors411,425. Major TTPs that have been leveraged include fileless malware69 and
attacks against the RDP protocol70. Financial institutions and the retail sector are the most prominent
targets328 and it is highly likely that cyber criminals will continue to leverage advanced TTPs initially
used by nation state actors.



The mobile malware landscape is steadily increasing. Mobile malware threats increase year-overyear and the continued use of older operating systems amplifies the problem248,418. Major mobile
threats include credential theft71, mobile remote access trojans421 and SIM card abuse/hijacking
(followed by adware72 and cryptomining248, especially for Android devices454). Mobile threats are
expected to increase due to the mobile market growth, users’ shift to mobile banking and the
upcoming rollout of the 5G mobile standard241. Moreover, it is expected that cyber criminals will put
effort on increasing sophistication421 of mobile malware as well as its’ delivery vectors (e.g. Roaming
Mantis spreading via DNS hijacking73). Finally, advanced cyber actors will further focus on high-end
malware/spyware (e.g. Pegasus74 and Dark Caracal75,76) and exploit mobile vulnerabilities.



Cyber criminals are moving from ransomware to cryptojacking458. While the growth of ransomware
has been slowed245, threat actors have moved to cryptojacking as it is simpler, more profitable and
less risky for them244. It is expected that cyber criminals will be leveraging cryptojacking at scale,
continue embedding cryptoming capabilities to malware families435 and mostly focus on targeted

ransomware campaigns. More information on cryptojacking and ransomware threats can be found in
the respective sections of this report (see Ransomware threat in chapter 3.14).


Fileless attack techniques are the new norm. Fileless malware techniques operate without placing
malicious executables on the file system77. Fileless attacks are divided into 4 major techniques78: 1)
malicious documents (e.g. Microsoft Office with malicious macros, PDF files containing malicious
JavaScript and abuse of DDE79), 2) malicious scripts (e.g. PowerShell, VBScript, batch files and
JavaScript), 3) living-off-the-land techniques (e.g. WMI, LOLBins and LOLScripts80) and 4) malicious
code in memory (e.g. PowerSploit93, Doppelgänging81). During the reporting period, we have observed
increasing fileless attack detections82 the prevalence of which is so high that 77% of the attacks that
successfully compromised organizations utilized fileless techniques82. We expect that fileless attack
techniques will continue to be used by cyberthreat actors due to their effectiveness in evading
detection by organisations’ security controls. For more information about fileless attack-vector,
please consult chapter 5.4.



A consistent year-over-year decline of financial trojans248. While financial trojans are still one of the
most prevalent consumer threats, the number of detections over the years is falling248. This can be
attributed to improved security controls, law enforcement activities and the shift of cyber criminals
towards other ways of making profit. It is interesting that some financial trojans do not only steal
banking credentials but also cryptocurrency wallet logins83, while some have also added cryptomining
capabilities172,436. Most prevalent financial trojans during 2018 are Zeus, Emotet84, URLzone, Ursnif
and Trickbot85. It is expected that financial trojans will continue to be a key threat in the financial
sector while cyber criminals are focusing on alternative ways to generate profits241.



The first malware targeting safety systems of critical infrastructure. During the reporting period, we
have observed Triton which is the first malware that targets Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)86,87,88.
Safety instrumented systems are designed to shut down industrial processes when unsafe operating
conditions are reached. Successful exploitation of such systems could lead to serious implications (see

Stuxnet89 and Industroyer90). It is expected that the ICS/SCADA domain will be increasingly targeted by
advanced threat actors having the capability and intent to execute such operations.


Continued growth in the usage of open-source malware59. The “Githubification”91 of Infosec gave the
opportunity for everyone to access hacking tools and frameworks like Mimikatz92, Powersploit93,
Metasploit94, Empire95, PowerShell96, PHP webshells97, etc. Cyber-crime groups as well as cyber
espionage groups have been extensively leveraging open source and publicly available tools for their
campaigns. The goals of this approach are to make attribution efforts harder and to reduce their
toolset development costs. We expect the continued usage and customization of such tools by both
cyber espionage and cyber-crime actors.



Exploit kits in the back seat of preferred attack vectors. While exploit kits are still a threat, cyber
criminals prefer other attack vectors to deliver their malicious payloads428. This trend has been
observed since 2016 when the disappearance of three prevalent exploit kits took place: Angler,
Nuclear and Neutrino242. The decline of exploit kits poses additional challenges to cyber criminals in
order to deliver their malware454. Major exploit kits now are RIG EK, GrandSoft EK, Magnitude EK,
GreenFlash Sundown EK, KaiXin EK and Underminer EK98. The identified low threat posed by exploit
kits has resulted in not including this threat in the Top 15 of this ENISA Threat Landscape 2018 report
for the first time since 2013.

3.1.3 Trends and main statistics


Although adware is one of the easiest ways to distribute malware and more often ignored by users,
there has been few developments of this threat during the reporting period428.



According to Verizon DBIR334, the frequency of detected malware types is: .js (37,2%), .vbs (20,8%),
Windows executable (14,8%), MS Office (14,4%), .pdf (3,3%) other (7,0%).



A prevalence of polymorphic malware has been observed in the last years as 94% of all malicious
executables have been polymorphic417.



79% of the detected malware in organisations were targeting Windows, 18% Linux and 3% Mac
systems436.



The first Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) malware has been discovered in the wild99.



Most of the mobile malware was hosted in 3rd part app stores and the app categories that most
mobile malware was found were Lifestyle (27%) and Music & Audio (20%)248.



On the positive side, a decline has been observed in the detections of PUA (Potential Unwanted
Applications) tracking user behaviour454.



During 2018, there have been published a number of “celebrity” chipset vulnerabilities: Spectre and
Meltdown100,101, AMDFlaws102 and Foreshadow103.



During the reporting period, the trend of pre-installed malware455 has been observed in cases such as
RottenSys104 and Triada banking trojan105.



Remote Access Trojans are on the rise having FlawedAmmyy as the first ever RAT to appear in the top
ten malware list106.



Endpoints are increasingly targeted and this is the result of the blurring organisation perimeter and
mobility334. By targeting endpoints, attackers can conduct reconnaissance, move laterally and further
execute their malicious actions. The figure below provides a historical perspective of cyber attack’s
targets over past years.

3.1.5 Specific attack vectors
Again this year, it comes as no surprise that compromised email (phishing, spam and spear-phishing) is
the dominating attack vector for malware infections. According to Verizon DBIR334, email compromise
was the attack vector for 92,4% of detected malware, web and browser was the attack vector for 6,3%
and 1,3% has been attributed to other attack vectors. Moreover, a non-negligible amount of malware still
spreads via the web implying that web and browser based attack vectors such as exploit kits, malvertising,
drive-by and strategic web compromise are not dead. Besides email and web, special attention should be
given to the abuse of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as an attack vector. The FBI has already published
reports on the increasing usage of RDP to spread malware and more specifically ransomware70. Finally,
supply chain attacks is another attack vector can be utilised for delivering the malicious payload to
targeted organisations107.

3.1.6 Specific mitigation actions
The mitigation vector for this threat contain the following elements:


Relying exclusively on end-point or server malware detection and mitigation is not sufficient. Malware
detection should be implemented for all inbound/outbound channels, including network, web and
application systems in all used platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal computers and
mobile devices).



Establish interfaces of malware detection functions (intelligence led threat hunting) with security
incident management in order to establish efficient response capabilities.



Use available tools on malware analysis as well as sharing of malware information and malware
mitigation (i.e. MISP)108.



Develop a security policies that specify the processes followed in cases of infection. Involve all

Web Based Attacks
3.2.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Web based attacks are those that use web systems and services as the main surface for compromising the
victim/target. This includes browser exploitations and injections (including extensions), websites, Content
Management System (CMS) exploitation, and web services. For instance, drive-by, watering-hole,
redirection and man-in-the-browser attacks are a few known categories of such attacks. Web based
attacks continued to be observed as one of the most important threats due to their wide spread surface
across the threat landscape, from general ad related spamming campaigns to banking trojans117 and
multiple Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups118 facilitating such attacks as their techniques to target
victims. This threat is expected to increase as more malware and exploitation techniques rely more
heavily on it, as a delivery mechanism, during the end-to-end attack path.

3.2.2 Interesting points
Below are some interesting points about web based attacks:


APTs, malware campaigns and potential usage of watering-hole attacks. During March 2018 a
security firm investigated a major telecommunication company in Hong Kong and identified a flash
exploit (CVE-2018-4878) on their group’s corporate website – a great example of watering-hole
attacks119. In addition, roughly during the same time, another campaign was identified targeting
national datacentres in central Asia potentially to conduct watering hole attacks, targeting employees
and governments120. Since September, another aggressive attempt to get into Adobe ColdFusion
vulnerable servers was observed which for now, are not yet used for any malicious purposes. Security
researchers believe that these will be used for staging phase as watering-hole or delivering spearphishing attacks121. On the other hand, in March 2018 the group behind Promethium (a.k.a
StrongPity) had abused the deep packet inspection hardware, used by Turks telecom, redirecting
customers in Turkey and Syria to download spyware122.



New Financial malware with new web-based capability. During Q1 2018, Dridex made a return and
was found to be more active as a financial malware with its script injection/redirect capability to steal
credentials. Emotet was observed delivering spam and financial malware payloads123 while BackSwap
appeared in Q2124 with a more interesting technique - this banking trojan was observed using WinAPI
to open the console of the developer mode and inject scripts in the page or browser by emulating
keystrokes. Further updates to this trojan added the capability of using the same technique to inject
the script to the address bar.



Browser Extensions and different Targets. Around June 2018, the “Desbloquear Conteúdo” Chrome
browser extension was identified targeting Brazilian’s using online banking with the purpose of
collecting banking credentials125. Moreover, fake extensions pretending to masquerade legitimate

extensions started compromising end-users by asking for elevated access levels during their
installation126. Not surprisingly with the hype of cryptocurrencies, a Chrome Extension was identified
by TrendMicro with multiple capabilities (FacexWorm - around April 2018) namely: injecting miners
(.js), stealing credentials for crypto-trading platforms, hijacking transactions and hijacking traffic to
attacker’s referral links (for crypto related referral programs)127.


Content Management Systems (CMS) compromises on the rise. Early this year several attacks were
observed against Drupal delivering browser-based cryptocurrency miners and social engineering
toolkits128. Later on, in September 2018, a wave of attacks was seen targeting Wordpress vulnerable
websites129 and related plugins, delivering multiple threats to the client-side (i.e. malicious JavaScript,
malicious code in the wp_posts table etc.).



The trend of web browser based (drive-by) exploit-kits is continuing. According to Malwarebytes
spring and summer report, the majority of exploit kits were observed in Asia. This might be related to
the continued use of Internet Explorer (Japan, South Korea) in this part of the world. Apart from
known browser type exploit-kits, researchers observed an increase in drive-by downloads labelled as
“pseudo exploit-kits”. These type of exploit-kits typically miss a solid infrastructure and often result
from a single malicious software developer/actor copy and pasting from leaked or POC-type
exploits130.

3.2.3 Trends and main statistics


In the topic of browser type exploits, Internet Explorer (CVE-2018-8174) and Flash (CVE-2018-4878)
have been the most weaponised vulnerabilities for this type of web-based attacks131.



By Q2 2018:
o

A total of 351.913.075 unique malicious URLs were identified132, representing an increase in the
number of malicious URLs compared to Q1 totalling 282.807.433133. This is in contrast with the
stats from 2017 Q1134 and Q2135 where the trend was showing a decrease over these quarters.

o

The US (45,87%), Netherlands (25,74%), Germany (5,33%) and France (4,92%) were the top four
source countries for web-based attacks136, representing an increase not only for each country
compared to Q1 2018137 but also to 2017138 (figure 5).



According to G-Data security research139 more attacks are web based. Although the number of attacks
is fluctuating, they are becoming more targeted140.

The overall trend of web-based attacks in 2018 is INCREASING.

Figure 5: Web-Based Attack distribution by source Country (Q2, 2018)141

3.2.4 Specific attack vectors


Browser exploits: are forms of malicious code that take advantage of a flaw or vulnerability in an
operating system or piece of software with the intent to breach the browser security by altering the
settings without the user’s knowledge. Malicious code may exploit ActiveX, HTML, images, Java,
JavaScript, Flash and other Web technologies and cause the browser to run arbitrary code.



Drive-by downloads: is a common method of spreading malware as cybercriminals look for insecure
web sites to plant a malicious script into HTTP or PHP code on one of the pages. This script may install
malware directly onto the computer of someone who visits the site, or it may take the form of an
IFRAME that re-directs the victim to a site controlled by the cybercriminals. In many cases, the script
is obfuscated, to make it more difficult for security researchers to analyse the code. Such attacks are
called ‘drive-by downloads’ because they require no action from the victim — beyond simply visiting
the compromised web site: they are infected automatically (and silently) if their computer is
vulnerable.



Malicious URL’s: are URL’s created with malicious purposes, among them, to download any type of
malware to the affected systems, which can be contained in spam or phishing messages, or even
improve its position in search engines using Blackhat SEO techniques.



Water-holing: Is a malware attack in which the attacker observes the websites often visited by a
victim or a particular group and infects those sites with malware. A watering hole attack has the
potential to infect the members of the targeted victim group using specific configurations for the
malware to be able to select the targets from the infected users (based on their IP for example).



Content Management System (CMS) Compromise. Although this category might be briefly touched
upon in other vectors, it is noteworthy that these types of compromise usually refers to plugins and
functionalities on vulnerable system. Vulnerabilities that are subsequently exploited to deliver
malicious content/malware to the victim directly or indirectly by redirecting the victim to malicious
content.

3.2.5 Specific mitigation actions
The mitigation vector for this threat type includes:


Use web-traffic filtering to detect and block malicious payloads and destinations (IP’s, URL’s).



Use web-traffic encryption technologies such as SSL/TLS.



Update/patch web-browsers and web-server technologies and products regularly.



Update/patch CMS based websites regularly (i.e. WordPress, Joomla or Drupal) and avoid the
utilisation of third-party plugins (usually responsible for most of the attacks against CMS’s).



Protect all endpoint systems from unpatched software containing known vulnerabilities.



Avoid the installation of malicious programs through potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).



Monitor the behaviour of software to detect malicious object, such as web browser plug-ins.



Use web address, web content, files and applications reputation solutions, blacklisting and filtering to
establish risk-oriented categorization of web resources.



Check the application and web-browser settings to avoid unwanted behaviour based on default
settings (esp. for mobile devices) to provide a more secure environment (i.e. disabling unused
features, extensions and plugins – particularly from untrusted/unverified sources).

Web Application Attacks
3.3.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Web Application Attacks are regarded as direct or indirect attempts to exploit a vulnerability or weakness
in the services and applications on the web, abusing their APIs, runtime environments or services. In other
words, the simple abuse of an active or passive component of a software available via web. Notably,
these types of attacks overlap with web-based quite often due the shared services on the application side
and attack surface on the threat side. Web applications are becoming more interesting targets for
adversaries as more businesses and firms are becoming dependent on web services, both in revenue and
reputation. However, the trend of attacks during the reporting period shows a slight decrease in these
type of attacks142. Nevertheless, more firms are seeing what OWASP categorises as automated attacks143
during their first sixty day of appearance144, showing more efficient and automated exploiting capabilities
on the adversary side. On the other side as web applications represent a large part of attacks on the
internet145, enterprises and organisations are investing more on web applications detection, protection
and defense systems in 2018, which presents a positive move in the industry146.

3.3.2 Interesting points


SQL injection continues to lead the attacks types. SQLi attacks dominate the attack types in the web
application category by 51% although they are one of the most understandable by both attackers and
defenders. This include targeted (and non-targeted) scanning activity, which can easily be hidden
from the sight of defenders due to amount of noise generally caused.



Local File Inclusion and Cross-Site-Scripting count for the second and third most prominent attacks
with 34% and 8% respectively of the attacks in the wild during summer 2018.



Orphan routes and APIs representing security blind spots. “Dead code”, also known as orphan
routes/APIs are deprecated or abandoned parts of (web) applications with zero business purpose or
value, in other words: “blind spots”. Thus, the increase in usage of APIs and the business
interconnectivity concepts affects the attack surface (cause by blind spots) to rise exponentially147.



Fewer vulnerabilities observed for Finance, Retail and Healthcare. Although the number of critical
vulnerabilities in web apps grows year by year, White Hat security suggests that in 2018 less web
applications were found with critical vulnerabilities comparing to 2017 which is potentially reflecting
the investment of these industries in application security area148.



Legacy web application exploits are still among the top 20. According to Fortinet Q3 2018 research,
top 20 most prevalence web application exploits publish dates goes back to 2005. PHP injection as the
second on the list with 33,6% dating back to 2012 (CVE-2012-2311, CVE-2012-1823)149.

3.3.3 Trends and main statistics


SQLi attacks still dominate the attack types this year by 51%150, although this has almost stayed the
same since Q2 2017151.



Similarly, LFI and XSS were the second and third most prominent attacks with 34% and 8%
respectively of the attacks in the wild during summer 2018. The trend remained almost the same
since Q2 2017 (33% and 9%) and somehow a slight decrease in SQLi attacks (with 36%) if we want to
compare the trend to Q4 2017152.



According to a research by Edgescan team over vulnerability exposures and taxonomies: 29% of web
application vulnerabilities were associated with insecure configuration/deployments, 24% were
client-side related (i.e. XSS), 20% information leakage (i.e. default pages), 12% injections (i.e. SQLi),
6% authentication (i.e. CSRF), 5% authorisation weaknesses (i.e. file path traversals), 3% exposed
interfaces (i.e. APIs) and 1% denial of services153.



Web Application attacks dominated the trend in EMEA regardless of source with 42% among the
other attack types in 2018. Moreover, this type of attack is often linked to major data breaches
worldwide154.



The United States continued to lead the chart based on the web application attack source by 30,1% (
ca. 238 million attacks/alerts) and the Netherlands by 11,9% ( ca. 94 million attacks/alerts).
Subsequently China, Brazil and Russia each contributing with 7,1%, 6,2% and 4,4% were the major
attack sources geographically speaking in the first half of 2018155. These are relatively close figures to
web application attack during Q4 2017.



During Q3 2018, 1.114 detections were reported per firm in the topic of web application attacks
raising the overall index by 2%. However, 65,4% of the firms reported a severe malicious attempts
(web) which is a 6,6% decrease comparing to same period in 2017 (79% Q3 2017156 and 72% in Q4
2017157)158.

Phishing
3.4.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Phishing is the mechanism of crafting messages that use social engineering techniques so that the
recipient will be lured and "take the bait". More specifically, phishers try to lure the recipients of phishing
emails and messages to open a malicious attachment, click on an unsafe URL, hand over their credentials
via legitimate looking phishing pages, wire money, etc. Phishing is the preferred way of compromising
organisations179 and it has been reported that 75% of EU’s Member States disclosed cases of phishing241.
Phishing is so heavily leveraged that over 90% of malware infections and 72% of data breaches in
organisations originate from phishing attacks334.

3.4.2 Interesting points


Phishing attacks became more targeted. It is reported that while the traditional spam-related
phishing still exists, the number of targeted phishing attacks continue to grow411. The volumes of
hacked and leaked personal data give the opportunity for phishers to conduct convincing and
targeted phishing campaigns162 at scale (e.g. targeted sextortion scams163). Organised criminal groups
also target rich individuals, people with access to financial accounts or sensitive business data or even
public authorities that handle PII related data428 (PII is becoming a juicy target in the age of GDPR). We
assess that this trend will continue and phishing attacks will become increasingly targeted in the
future.



Shift from consumer to enterprise targets. While phishers mostly targeted consumers during the
previous years, an evolution has been observed that malicious actors are focusing on enterprise
targets241. This significant shift in threat actor motivations is profit-driven since enterprise data can be
leveraged in multiple and more profitable ways compared to consumer data (e.g. extortion, selling
data in underground marketplaces, etc.)421. This trend also aligned with the fact that, email services
(e.g. Microsoft O365164) and online services (e.g. DocuSign165 and Dropbox166) were the top phishing
target (26%) for first time above financial institutions (21%)421.



Steady growth in mobile phishing attacks. Phishing attacks on mobile devices have grown by an
average of 85% year-over-year since 2011167. Mobile devices give opportunities for cyber criminals to
utilize more attack vectors instead of email phishing. It has been observed that phishing via SMS,
mobile messaging (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.) and social media apps (e.g. Instagram) has
grown significantly167. More specifically, phishing of social media users has tripled during 2017 with
phishers exploiting the inherent trust relationship between users and the social media platforms421. A
new mobile attack method has been appeared (URL padding) that takes advantage of the small screen
size of mobile phones421. Finally, during the reporting period, we observed advanced threat actors
using mobile phishing techniques e.g. Dark Caracal168 and Pegasus169. We assess that due to the attack
surface that mobile devices provide as well as the increasing adoption of 2-factor authentication,
phishing attacks against mobile devices will continue to evolve in sophistication and increase in
occurrence.



Rapid increase in phishing sites using HTTPS. It has been reported that one third of phishing web
sites have been served via HTTPS during 2017 compared to 5% during 2016421,454,170. During the
reporting period it was observed that, phishers are shifting techniques and used free certificate
services (e.g. Let’s Encrypt171 or Comodo172) to challenge the misconception that, sites using HTTPS
are secure, safe and trustworthy. This shift follows the trend with the Internet’s wider adoption of
HTTPS173 and the fact that some browsers are starting to flag HTTP sites as “Not Secure”174. We expect
that the usage of HTTPS for phishing sites will continue to grow.



The problem of Business Email Compromise (BEC)241. BEC is a type of phishing attack (also known as
whaling) targeting C-level executives and employees in finance or human resources aiming to steal
money from their organisations. From October 2013 to May 2018, ca. 78.000 BEC attacks have been
reported worldwide responsible for US $12,5 billion of reported losses175. During the reporting period,
the majority of BEC attacks have targeted the real estate sector175 (fraud cases happening during the
property transaction) as well as employees working in human resources334. Due to the fact that 65%
of Member States have observed BEC phishing attacks241, this type of crime has gain the attention of

numbers of BEC attacks will remain stable339 and proportional179 to the total number of phishing
attacks.


Spearphishing is the de facto delivery method for APT groups. It is reported that 71% of APT groups
have used spearphishing as infection vector248. During the reporting period, the most high profile
organised crime groups were FIN7180,181 and Cobalt Group182. Furthermore, nation state actors still use
spearphishing as their primary infection vector for their espionage and disruption operations183,184.



Trends in malicious attachments. During 2017, phishers used 28% more malicious attachments
compared to malicious URLs within phishing emails183. The most common malicious file types in
phishing emails were Microsoft Office documents, archive files, JavaScript files, Visual Basic Scripts
and PDFdocuments 248,193,334. Phishers also used some new types of malicious attachments and some
that were used in new ways185: .arj (“Archived by Robert Jung”186), .z (GNU Gzip187), .iqy (Internet
Query Files188,189), and .pdf190 files. Legitimate platform features have also been exploited with most
notable the Microsoft Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)191. The most common vulnerability
exploited in phishing campaigns was CVE-2017-0199192 , targeting Microsoft Office OLE features.



Τhe most popular registrar of phishing domains during the first quarter of 2018 was GoDaddy170.



For large enterprises, it has been reported that for every legitimate brand registered domain, there
are 20 suspiciously registered ones (typosquatted) that can be used to impersonate the brand183.



Phishing domains used for typosquatting include the following variations: 41% have an individual
character swap, 32% have an additional character, 13% have added/removed leading or final
domain’s characters, 6% have removed a character and 5% are exact domain match but
hyphenated183.



It has been reported that organisational susceptibility rates for phishing campaigns in 2017 (10,8%)
have been reduced 2% compared to 2016 (12,%)201. This indicates the effectiveness of security
awareness campaigns within organisations.



Vishing was mostly reported within the financial sector while it was only one third of the EU Member
States reporting this type of attack 241.



Social media phishing has increased by 200% from 2016 to 2017. Social media accounts are useful for
phishers as they can be leveraged to conduct further cybercrime activities421.

The overall trend of phishing attacks in 2018 is INCREASING.

3.4.4 Top Phishing Themes
Given the nature of phishing, top phishing artefacts are characterised by topics addressed by phishing
messages. Top 20 phishing themes183 include:
1. Dropbox account phishing

3.4.5 Specific mitigation actions


Organisations should educate their staff to identify fake and malicious emails and stay vigilant. They
should also internally launch simulated phishing campaigns to test both their infrastructure and the
responsiveness of their staff.



Use a security email gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam,
anti-malware, policy-based filtering).



Consider applying security solutions that use machine learning techniques to identify phishing sites in
real time.



Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at the
email clients and update them frequently.



SPF (Sender Policy Framework)202, DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &
Conformance)203 and DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)204 are the three email security standards for
the reduction in spam. Relevant implementation of the aforementioned standards should be
deployed in the organisations.



Implement a fraud and anomaly detection system at network level for both inbound and outbound.



Ensure that users do not click on links or download attachments if you are not absolutely confident
about the source of an email.



Ensure that users do not click on random links and especially short-links found in social media.



Avoid the over-sharing of personal information in social media, e.g. time of absence from office or
home, flight information etc. as it is actively used by threat actors to collect information about
targets.



Check the domain name of the websites you visit for typos, especially for sensitive websites, e.g. bank
websites. Threat actors usually register fake domains that look similar to legitimate ones and use
them to “phish” their targets. Looking only for an https connection is not enough.



Enable two factor-authentication whenever applicable. Two factor-authentication can prevent
account takeover.



Use strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using the same password in various
services is a serious security issue and should be avoided at all times. Using strong and unique
credentials in every online service limits the risk of a potential account takeover to the affected

service only. The use of a password manager software would make the managing of the whole set of
passwords easier.


In case of wiring money to an account, double-check the bank information of the recipient through a
different medium. Unencrypted and unsigned emails should not be trusted, especially for sensitive
use-cases like these.



Implement multiple controls (including two-factor authentication) for critical financial transactions.

Denial of Service
3.5.1 Description of the cyberthreat
(Distributed) Denial of Services is one of the highly impactful threats in cyber landscape that has been
targeting almost any business or organisation. It has been quite clear that preserving a solid defence for
such threat has become extensively important for different organisations. According to Arbor Networks,
the strong demand for mitigation services provided by managed service providers in this field is notable
with financial services, e-commerce, cloud providers and governments on the top205. Also, Law
enforcement activities in this realm have played a key role for fighting against such malicious activities by
running operations to take down services like “webstressor.org”206 during the first half of 2018. Although
this has been a great achievement, DDoS for hire services like this are not few and still the landscape is
seeing activities with similar characteristics. On the other side the increase in the number of connected
services globally and their dependency on the Internet of Things (IOTs) to run and facilitate such services
raised concerns over threats like DoS attacks to potentially cause nation wide failures for businesses and
critical systems. One example of such services is the concept of connected hospitals and related
services207. Yet with all the mitigation and preventative activities across the world reports and researches
suggest that the number of DDoS activities are on the rise (16% increase). Although we might not be
observing too many large attacks208.

3.5.2 Interesting points


BCP38 and DDoS. Activities and research209 on Implementing ingress traffic filtering to avoid IPaddress spoofing in ISPs has been seen as a positive approach from different organisations and
government entities (i.e. NCSC UK). This approach prevents the ISPs infrastructure to be part of
(generate) DDoS attacks which are facilitating the spoofed-IP technique210.



Internet of connected Services. More organisations are depending on technologies and accordingly
higher demand for connected services and information. Multiple reports emphasise the fact that APIs
are becoming a popular attack surface for malicious actor in order to interrupt services in different
organisations211. Also, researchers in CERT-EU predicted that health organisations are at risk of denial
of service due to the same concept (connected hospitals with 80.000 publicly available medical
devices).



DDoS and geo-politics landscape. In Mexico a presidential candidate’s website (Ricardo Anaya) was
under a DDoS attack while he was running a television debate. This has been attributed (unverified) to
an activity of a Russian based botnet by the candidate’s campaign. Similar activity has been observed
targeting the website of the Ukraine president when the authorities started blocking access to Russian
media. On the other hand, a large DDoS attack caused operation failure to the largest (and state-run)

train service provider in Denmark (Services disrupted included mobile application, ticketing machines
and the website). During April 2018, law enforcement agencies from the US and UK announced that
they have identified a considerable number of infected devices (in EU, US and Australia) attributed
and ran by Russian hackers ready to run state sponsored attacks. Just in matter of days a website
owned by a Russian political party (United Russia) went down for two days by a DDoS campaign212.


Largest reflection-amplification attacks – Still on the rise. GitHub became a victim of a 1.35Tbps
(126.9 million pps) amplified DDoS attack213. The attack was originating from different autonomous
systems misusing memcached services (UDP port 11211). Five days after that incident, on 5th of
March 2018 Arbor networks announced214 a 1.7Tbps attack targeting a US service provider facilitating
the same memcached technique. Interesting enough since the first incident on GitHub the number of
vulnerable memcached servers was cited publicly as 17000 and only 500 were remained vulnerable by
June 2018.



Filtering at the Service provider level will help the defenders. Researchers at akamai believe that
deploying few strategies at the telecoms or service provider lever will block a good amount of DDoS
attacks at the source and prevent the ongoing infection on the customer side of ISPs. For instance,
blocking DNS based C&C communication queries of a botnet (i.e. Necrus) in the provider’s network
can ideally prevent the complete DDoS functionality of that botnet. Other strategies like securing
cloud assets and keeping residential address space clean were proposed215.



One of many DDoS for hire services taken down (Operation Power-Off). With the rise in providing
such services the price for running individual DDoS attacks was found to be as small as US $5. Thus
more frequent attacks leads to a better business for the malicious service provider. Not surprisingly
the price varies based on different capabilities of the service such as parallel attacks, limits per day
and different vectors to flood the target with216. April 2018, the United Kingdom’s major law
enforcement agency (National Crime Agency) along with the Dutch crime unit (Dutch National High
Tech Crime Unit) took down a major DDoS platform known as “webstresser.org” hosting more than
136,000 users. It was reported that 4 to 6 million attacks worldwide were initiated using this
platform217.


Multi-Vector DDoS attacks were observed with different characteristics. As mentioned above,
DDoS-for-hire is among the most popular services. Due to its nature, time constraint is one of the
main characteristics of these services. Akamai reported a specific attack series targeting DNS
servers of the organisation for almost 2 days intermittently which also included another vector
(PSH/ACK - TCP based) peaking at 120 Gbps (18.6Mpps). Additionally, a young malicious actor
introduced a set of traffic generators in a YouTube tutorial peaking at 170 Gbps (65Mpps). When
the attack was not as effective as desired, the traffic moved from targeting a single IP to flooding
the full /24 subnet using a SYN ACK flood reflected off of legitimate servers across a host of

geographies. Other multi vector reflected attacks misusing IKE and IPMI protocols brings back the
theory that “Mirai” code is still progressing218.


Looking forward in the DDoS landscape. No Surprise to see larger and more destructive attacks,
Considering the addition of empowered mobile devices (5G and more processing power) and IOTs.
Relatively application level attacks are predicted to rise219.



IoTs and DDoS attacks. During the first quarter of 2018 a spike was observed over the number and
duration of DDoS attacks. Researchers at Kaspersky labs believe that was linked directly to Darkai and
AESDDoS220 IoT botnets. Moreover, in Q3 Fortinet reported activity of Mirai and Gafgyt after receiving
new updates in addition to Bushido IoT botnet which was mainly inspired from Mirai brute forcing
through telnet and IRC enabled devices221.

3.5.3 Trends and main statistics


Reports suggest an increase (16%) in the total number of DDoS attacks in Summer 2018 comparing to
same season in 2017222.



An Annual survey suggested that top motivations for DDoS attacks are: Online Gaming, attackers
presenting their niche capabilities and extortion223.



4% increase observed in reflection type attack and almost 16% in network type attacks (Layer 3 and 4)
in 2018224. Bearing in mind, 99% of the recorded attacks were infrastructure related in 2017225.



52% attacks were utilizing multiple vectors (at least two) in Q2 2018. These attacks were observed to
target multiple services like Email and IPSEC misusing GRE and SNMP protocols226.



While some reports227 suggested that “Webstreessor.org” (the biggest DDoS for hire service) take
down reportedly had a dramatic impact on decrease of DDoS attacks (~60%) in Europe, others
reflected that DDoS activity rose after this action in the second half of 2018228.

accounted for 44,72%. 4,62% lasted longer than 1.200 minutes. The average duration was 318,10
minutes, while the longest attack lasted 6 days, 5 hours, and 22 minutes.



In terms of highly targeted regions, though during second quarter of 2018, China remains the most
attractive targets covering 52,36% of the total number of unique attacks since 2017. US with 17,75%
and Hong Kong with 12,88% comes as the second and third attractive targets.

According to Netscout, the maximum number of DDoS attacks observed during the first half of 2018
increased (174%) compared to the same time period in 2017234. The frequency though decreased by
13%.
The overall trend of denial of service attacks in 2018 is INCREASING.

3.5.4 Top 5 DDoS attacks


Memcached (reflected) amplification attacks. A legitimate service which is developed for handling a
distributed memory caching system (using UDP) can be easily exploited to reflect the traffic to target
with an amplification factor of 50.000 times of the original request.



Multi target DDoS. When the attackers are not seeing the desired impact on their target they tend to
extend their impact to the wider network range to have a more distributed impact and potentially
keep the defence teams busier. This methodology was observed by facilitating multiple DDoS vectors
(i.e. SYN floods, amplification and application layer) targeting the entire /24 subnet.



Cache Busting DDoS. In this type of attack the malicious actor aims to bypass the application’s
caching capability by sending random (or not recognizable) GET requests to flood the application
server with requests to handle.



Persistent DDoS Attacks (i.e. multi-day). This type of DDoS is famous for its two stages of infecting
hosts and creating botnet of zombies who pretend to be a well defended endpoint and the attack
phase that has been seen to take from minutes to over multiple days. The vector varies from network
type attacks to application layer attacks235.



Encrypted Attacks. The rise of using encrypted services and traffic (SSL) on the web has attracted
different levels of DDoS attacks. This includes attacks on the application level (flood attacks,
bruteforce etc.), network level and the protocol level (i.e. SSL renegotiation or downgrade) making it
harder for defenders and toolsets to recognise malicious traffic from legitimate236.

3.5.5 Specific attack vectors
According to Nexusgaurd Q2 2018 report, most of the attacks were focused on hit-run tactics and
specifically during peak times to strike their targets with UDP, TCP (SYN) and ICMP floods being the top 3
vectors. The duration of these malicious attempts were mostly recorded as lasting less than 90 minutes
and the longest to more than 6 days.

3.5.6 Specific mitigation actions


Assess the requirements for considering DDoS managed services (either through internet service
provider or directly)



Promote the appropriate use (implementation, detection, update) of different defence technologies
like firewalls, web application firewalls, IPS/IDS systems, network flow, Access Control Lists and
Intelligent DDoS mitigation tools or services on the network (perimeter, cloud or hybrid)238.



Remediate the information leakages related to the infrastructure (leak path) helping defenders
reducing or even preventing a potential attack239.



Promote proactive activities by the provider to filter and clean their infrastructure playing a key role
in preventing impactful denial of service attempts. Facilitating cache servers or dropping DNS queries
at source are good examples of such proactive approaches240.



Identify the critical devices, processes and design by implementing and testing a service failure
response and recovery plan in line with the broader Incident Response (DDoS Runbook).



Internet Providers, carries and cloud providers play a key role in mitigating DDoS malicious attempts.
Collaboration and communicating with such providers are key to a successful mitigation.

Spam
3.6.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Spam is the abusive use of email and messaging technologies to flood users with unsolicited messages.
Spam dates back to the beginning of the Internet and is mainly distributed by large spam botnets.
Although it is continuously reducing in volume, spam is still one of the major attack vectors observed in
the wild. During the last years spam has evolved, (i.e. spam via social media and messengers) and it is
assessed that it will continue to be used241. Spam is regarded a threat because of its low cost to send
messages while it is time consuming and costly for spam recipients and service providers in terms of
network bandwidth and storage. The good news here is that, the coordinated law enforcement activities
for botnet takedowns and the advances in anti-spam technologies have resulted in lowering the spam
numbers during the last years.

3.6.2 Interesting points


Consistent decrease in spam activity during the past decade. During the past decade, a consistent
decrease in spam activity has been observed. This could be attributed to the efforts of law
enforcement as well as the changing economics for the underground spamming ecosystem242.

Figure 14: Spam as a percentage of total inbound email242



Stable spam rate activity during the past 12 months. Based on the statistics of the total number of
daily emails compared to the total number of daily spam emails during the past 12 months, the spam
rate is almost stable as can be seen in the figure below243:

ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

Figure 15: Total number of daily emails vs total number of daily spam emails (in billions)243



Necurs is the top spamming botnet. 88%249 of spam comes from botnets and the top 3 spamming
botnets are: Necurs, Gamut and Cutwail244. During 2016 and 2017, spam-borne malware comes
almost entirely from Necurs242 and it is reported that 75%244 to 97%245 of total spam comes from
Necurs. During 2017, Necurs has sent out almost 15 million emails in total while it has sent ca. 67.000
emails per day in the second half of 2017248. Necurs operates in shorts bursts of heavy spamming that
are followed by dormant periods242. During its periods of full activity, the botnet sends spam from ca.
200.000 to ca. 4.000.000 unique IP addresses daily242. Although a decrease in Necurs activity has been
observed, the start-and-stop nature of Necurs makes it difficult to make safe conclusions about
potential decrease in the size of the botnet or actual decrease in its activity242.



Spam via messengers and social networks. It has been reported that spammers have been using
WhatsApp to distribute their content (mostly fictional lotteries, airplane ticket giveaways, popular
retailers, etc.)250. Social networks are also abused to deliver spamming content via fake celebrity and
company accounts, viral threads or even via the advertising mechanisms offered by the social
network250. A recent survey reported that 47% of social media users are seeing more spam in their
feeds246 (79% of which believe that spam content on social media includes fake news).



GDPR-themed spam. A large number of GDPR-themed spam emails have been observed during the
first quarter of 2018247. This spam activity included mostly paid seminars, webinars and workshops
related to the new EU’s privacy regulation.



Larger organisations have higher spam rates. It has been reported that, during 2017, employees of
large organisations receive more spam emails compared to the employees of smaller ones248.



Spam is getting more “international”. While one year ago 96% of the spam was in English, the levels
of spam in English have fallen to 90%249. This indicates a trend that spam is getting more
“international” and localized.



Double email headers. During the second quarter of 2018, spammers tried to tamper the email
header in order to evade filtering250. More specifically, they used two “From” fields in the email
header: a first email address from a well-known organization that has undoubtedly good reputation
and subsequently, their real email address. The goal of spammers was to fool the email filters and to
be perceived as legitimate. However, modern anti-spam solutions can detect spam emails not only
based on the header details but also based on content.



Abuse of subscription forms for spamming. Another interesting technique that spammers used
during the reporting period was the abuse of the subscription forms. Spammers used a script that
auto-filled subscription forms of regular websites and inserted the target email address in the “Email”
form as well as a short message with a spam link in the form of the “Name”. Thus, the targets
received an automatic “list subscription” confirmation email that contained a spam link instead of
their name. Spammers wanted to fool email filters since usually the content of “list subscription”
confirmation emails is normally allowed.



Common spam types. 75% of spam emails is comprised of the following 3 categories: health related
spam (26,6%), spam delivering malware (25,7%) and spam for online dating sites(21,4%)242. Following
spam types include: stock spam (4,6%), phony job offers (3,5%), phishing spam (2,1%), financial spam
(1,9%), adult spam (1,5%), etc.242.



Spam gangs. It is reported that 80% of the spam targeting Internet users is coming from 100
persistent spam gangs251. Top spam gangs include: Canadian Pharmacy, Blaze Media Solutions,
PredictLabs, Guangzhou-Seoul Information Technology Co. and RR Media.

3.6.3 Trends and main statistics


Spam emails from webmail services are not very common as only 0,7% of spam is sent from webmail
accounts like Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail249.



Spam emails are small in size since 40% of spam emails were 2Kb in size252.



The Mining, Construction and Manufacturing sectors had the highest spam rate during 2017248.



The average daily spam volume is 295,62 billion, while the average daily legitimate email volume is
51,18 billion243. Thus, legitimate email volume is 14,76% of the total email volume while spam volume
is 85,23% of the total email volume.



The Top Level Domains (TLDs) that are the riskiest and spammy-est on the Internet are the following:
.gq , .cf , .loan , .tk , .ml , .ga , .men , .faith , .top and .racing253,254.

The overall trend of spam attacks in 2018 is STABLE.

3.6.5 Specific mitigation actions
The mitigation measures for spam and spam-based threats are the following:


255

Use a security email gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam, antimalware, policy-based filtering).

https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/botnet-cc/, accessed October 2018.

57

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019



Disable the automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at
the email clients and update them frequently.



Implement SPF (Sender Policy Framework)256, DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication,
Reporting & Conformance)257 and DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)258 email security standards for
the reduction of spam.



Implement reputation filters, content filters, RBL (Real-time Blackhole List) and other measures.



Use AI and specifically machine learning and anomaly detection techniques.



Educate users, e.g. to ask themselves, e.g. if they know the sender, if they feel comfortable with the
attachment content and type, if they recognize the subject matter of the mail, etc.



The most important threat (impostor email) is still the most difficult to identify and mitigate as it does
not rely on technical means but rather on social-engineering, and the abuse of the inherent trust in a
known email partner. Therefore, user awareness and training is the first step in fighting it. In that
respect, there are training services that mimic tactics used by malicious actors. Such trainings aim to
identify individuals that might fall for them and essentially educate them on how to recognise and
counter similar attacks.

Botnets
3.7.1 Description of the cyberthreat
During 2018, botnets were observed to be active and serving different malicious activities. From Necurs
and Gamut covering almost 97% of the spam related attacks259 to the variation of IoT related botnets,
social media260 and ads, which were driving sales for botnets261. On a different note, although the Mirai
creators were arrested262, its technique and source code inspired many other actors to take the same
approach and build more sophisticated IoT botnets. Tori-bot is one of the good examples with 6 different
persistency techniques targeting multiple architectures. Another interesting trend in 2018 was the
updates and patches, which were delivered to these botnets for enhanced functionalities like VpnFilter
and Hide and Seek botnets. In addition to these credential stuffing/reusing attacks saw a dramatic
increase according to Akamai’s September report. Below we will briefly cover interesting points and
trends of 2018 followed by top attacks and mitigation techniques.

3.7.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points for botnets are as follows:


Another face of Necurs. For more than 6 years263 since its existence, Necurs has shown different faces
from delivering sophisticated banking malware to huge spam campaigns. Since September 11, IBM XForce spamtraps caught new cyber extortion campaign from Necurs aimed at blackmailing users who
are supposedly watching adult content264.



Fbot tracking Crypto mining Botnets. Since September 2018, researchers from Netlab observed a
new botnet activity with three specific interesting characteristics: aimed at removing crypto mining
related malware/botnets, using blockchain based DNS to resolve C2s and quite bounded to the
original Satori botnet265.



Torii IOT botnet. Different from the Mirai and other Mirai-inspired botnets, Tori-bot keeps
persistency by using 6 different techniques without providing any typical services like DDoS or cryptomining (at least not yet). However, it provides a modular architecture for retrieving and executing
commands and exfiltration capabilities as well as multi-layered encrypted communication
mechanism. It also targets multiple computer architectures (x86_64, x86, ARM, MIPS, Motorola 68k,
SuperH, PPC etc.)266.



Chalubo botnet. Sophos researchers identified the activity of another Linux-based botnet in their
honeypots trying to brute-force SSH to gain access. After the infection, the bot (Lua script) seems to
be focusing mostly on DDoS attacks (DNS, UDP and SYN floods).



Botnets Updated: VpnFilter, a multistage and modular botnet originally developed to target the
Modbus protocol, receive an update. Partially attributed to Fancy Bear267, this botnet presents 7 new
features including: network discovery, larger coverage on endpoint exploitation and obfuscating the
source of the attack. Researchers found this botnet infecting Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, TP-Link and
QNAP NAS network devices268. In addition to VPNFilter updates, Hide and Seek (HNS), which was
initially found targeting IP cameras269, also received an update to cover android devices by exploiting
Android Debug Bridge (ADB), similar to the Fbot botnet270. It is noteworthy that devices manufactured
in Taiwan, China and Korea are typically distributed with this functionality enabled. For more
information on multistage and modular threats, please consult chapter 5.5.



Botnets and credential reuse attacks. Researchers at Akamai reported that in 2018 (between MayJune) 8,3 billion malicious login attempts using automated bots were identified. The main objectives
of these malicious attempts were to forge Identities, information gathering and capturing goods or
money271.



Botnet to Lease. Renting out botnets was observed to be a reliable source for malicious actors to
monetize their activities. Occasionally, these providers create some additional regular income by
providing extra support packages with their lease options. As an example, Blow-bot was seen costing
US $750 to US $1,200 based on the support and features needed272.



Social Media, a platform to run and advertise botnets. It has been reported that, different profiles on
Instagram are selling access to many IoT type botnets along with stolen or compromised data.
Although this trend was mostly common on fraud and money laundry activities, now it seems that
malicious actors are turning to these platforms due to huge coverage of potential customers with
minimal content moderation273. On the other hand, Proofpoint researchers investigated a botnet that
was misusing an old Facebook API and a third-party app to run spam campaigns. For instance,
gathering likes and followers for Facebook branded posts and pages274.



Predictions made regarding botnets. Besides the above interesting points, some predictions
regarding botnets have been assessed in the reporting period. These are:

o

Swarmbots and hivenets. Recent reports predict that the evolution of botnets could be tied
closely with swarm type of attacks275, considering that these are scalable in architecture and
autonomy. The concept of sharing collected intelligence between bots is to remove the
dependency on the “bot master” or “bot herder”, to provide commands. This type of activity has
the potential to overwhelm the defence systems and teams by not only decreasing the time
needed for different stages of an attack by the attacker but, simultaneously attacking different
devices or infrastructure and exploiting vulnerabilities en-mass276. Hide and Seek botnet
enhancements providing bidirectional commands in a peer-to-peer way is a small example of
such capabilities.

o

Blockchain and Botnets. Researchers at Fortinet predicted the usage of blockchain in Command
and Control (C2) communications in the near future due to the characteristics and cost effectivity
of blockchain based communications. However, no sign of adoption of such methodology has
been seen in the cybercriminal landscape277.

3.7.3 Trends and main statistics


In Q1 2018, the number and duration of DDoS attacks rose compared to Q4 2017 and Kaspersky
researchers believe that can be directly linked to 2 linux-based botnets known as Darkai and
AESDDoS278.



The percentage of Linux-based botnet decreased slightly compared to Q4 2017 (from 71% to
66%)279.



Regarding credential reuse in botnets, Akamai reported that each botnet is creating 300.000
malicious login attempts per hour with US, Russia and Vietnam as the top 3 sources of the
attacks280.



According to McAfee’s September report, the United States is the top country for hosting botnet
control servers (36%) followed by Germany (14%) and Russia (5%) in the second and third
place281.



Gamut botnet by far was the dominant spam botnet in Q2 2018 with 86%. Most spams were
“Canada Revenue Agency” followed by bogus job offers and money Mule.



Source code of 7 variants of Mirai was leaked via a twitter handler in first half of 2018: Akiru,
Katrina_V1, Sora, Owari, Saikin, Josho_V3, and Tokyo282.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

The overall trend of botnet attacks in 2018 is INCREASING.

3.7.4 Top Botnet Attacks


A new botnet was created in just one day by exploiting at least 18.000 Huawei routers using the old
CVE-2017-17215 vulnerability. The code of this botnet was then used in Satori and Brickerbot botnets
reportedly283.



Necurs 2018 activity represents its multiple faces: after a typical stream of spams, in August 2018 the
Necurs botnet targets more than 3.701 banking domains284. During the same month, the botnet was
observed delivering Marap, which is a malware loader/dropper, to first fingerprint the infected device
and then deliver the main malware at later stage, based on the objectives of the attack285. Later on, in
September it was observed delivering language targeted adult-related extortion scams286, as reported
by X-Force research team, in one instance it was seen sending 3 million messages to German
recipients287. Still one of the most dominant botnets.



A credential reuse botnet attacked one fortune 500 financial services and made more than 8,5 million
malicious login attempts in just 48 hours, with a third of the traffic originated from Vietnam and the
United States288. Also as previously mentioned, the general credential stuffing/reusing attacks
between May and June 2018 were around 8.300 million attempts.

3.7.5 Specific attack vectors
Botnets are unique in different ways when it comes to attack vectors. The infected machines (zombie
networks) are created by exploiting common vulnerabilities, brute-forcing and other common infection
techniques. Furthermore, the “botnet herder” facilitates and provides a platform for different malicious
attacks. Examples range from distributing spam, malware infections, credential reuse, crypto-mining and
most commonly DDoS.

3.7.6 Specific mitigation actions
As discussed Botnets are used in different types of attacks. DDoS attacks are a common scheme for usage
of Botnets and we discussed the mitigation techniques in the chapter 3.5, describing the DDoS threat.
Moreover, mitigation vectors for this threat include:


Install and configure a network and application firewall.



Perform traffic filtering to all relevant channels (web, network, mail).



Install and maintain an IP address blacklist.

Data Breaches
3.8.1 Description of the cyberthreat
When it comes to threats and the cyber landscape, Data Breach is the only topic that does not specifically
apply to a threat but reflects a successful malicious attempt, which led to an incident from the
compromise or loss of data. Defined as a collective term for a successful incident from the leakage or
exposure of data (including sensitive information related to organisations or simply personal details of
individuals, i.e. medical information), it relates directly to the outcome from other cyberthreats.

3.8.2 Interesting points


Healthcare and Social Media. Six social media breaches, including the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook
incident, accounted for over 56% of the total number of records compromised293. The Healthcare
sector continues to lead in the number of incidents (27%). The largest incident was reported by 211
LA County, disclosing the exposure of 3,5 million records from accidental loss.



Data is exposed or compromised every day. According to the "breach level index report”, more than
25 million records were compromised or exposed every day during the first six months of 2018294. In
the United States alone, 22 million records were lost or stolen until July 2018.



Encryption is broken. Only 1% of all the data leaked, lost or stolen was encrypted which presents a
decrease compared with 2017.



Web Applications attacks and breaches. Researchers suggests that web-application attacks often
result in larger data breaches295. Not surprisingly, cloud infrastructure seems to be the most attractive
target for malicious actors.



Costs of a cybersecurity breach. The average cost of a cybersecurity breach increased 6,4% in 2018.
Notably, the average size of a data breach is typically amplified by 2,2%. Third-party involvement and
extensive cloud migration at the time of a breach increases the cost386. Factors such as incident
response and encryption are repeatedly identified as key to reduce the costs of a data breach296.



Insiders still play a big role. Different reports suggest that 48% of data breach incidents involved
outsiders and 27% were caused by human factor or negligence. This leaves 25% for system errors and
glitches (business processes and IT)297.



The 2018 prediction on data breaches. The enforcement of GDPR in Europe predicted an increase in
the number of extortion attacks, targeting private/personal data covered by this directive. In other
words, malicious actors will increase the number of data breach attempts298 threatening with GDPR
penalties deriving from the disclosure. Furthermore, multiple reports suggest that data breaches will

cause additional problems especially to US-companies299, due to the introduction of new data
protection regulations in different countries300. Gemalto suggested that the implementation of
Australian regulation (Notifiable Data Breach) had an impact on the number of breaches, increasing
from 18 to 308 in the country301. Considering the number of social media breaches, this trend is
expected to increase as more sectors are leveraging from these platforms to reach audiences301.

3.8.3 Trends and main statistics


Data Breaches compromised 4.500 million records in first half of 2018.



Europol reported that external individual malicious actors carried out 73% of the breaches and 50%
were attributed to organised crime groups. Additionally, the industry believes that state sponsored
actors were involved302 in ca. 12% of the data breaches.



Social media ranks top for the number of records breached (56%) due to the high-profile customer
data compromised from Facebook and Twitter, involving 2.2000 million and 336 million respectively.



Healthcare continues to lead in number of incidents (27%). The largest of such incident, 211 LA
County, exposed 3,5 million records through accidental loss.



Identity theft continues to be the leading type of data breaches (56%). This has been the leading
factor since 2013, according to Gemalto.



Considering the geographic landscape:
o

North America is considered the most popular target representing 57% of the breaches and 72%
of the records exposed.

o

Europe observed a 36% decrease in the number of incidents but a 28% increase in the number of
records breached, with UK organizations being the most affected in Europe.



In terms of breach costs, Canada leads in direct costs and the United States has the highest indirect
costs (US $81 per compromised record in Canada and US $152 in US)386.



The number of incidents with data breaches declined comparing the first half of 2017 (171) with 2018
(123). However, the number of records breached increase exponentially, from 2,7 million in the first
half of 2017 to 4.5 billion in the first half of 2018.301



Ca. 48% of the breaches identified, used hacking techniques such as malware ca. 30-51% and email as
a delivery mechanism ca. 49%302.

The overall trend of data breaches in 2018 is INCREASING.

victims of data breach incidents with different types of personal identifiable information (PII)
exposed, emphasising the growing number incidents in 2018.311

3.8.5 Specific attack vectors
SQL Injections Attack. This type of attack remains the most popular and commonly used web application
attack. Also referred as cloud malware injection attacks312, these are gaining popularity from an increasing
demand for cloud hosting services.
Phishing Attacks. Attackers are targeting companies by trying to impersonate a partner or a vendor
through an email that asks users to take an action. These emails are giving attackers an access point to
critical data or information.
Insider threat. This category includes any kind of unauthorised or malicious use of organisational
resources. Although most of the attacks are facilitated by external actors, insiders (with or without
privileged access) are playing a key role in data breaches.
Physical theft and loss. This refers to intentional or unintentional loss of data due to physical or social
engineering attacks.

3.8.6 Specific mitigation actions
Due to the wide nature of threats that can lead to a data breach, the below-mentioned mitigation
controls overlap with other cyberthreats. The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following

their legal, reputational and financial impact.



Enforce security awareness programs within the organization by developing and delivering training
courses to users. Train employees to identify and report suspicious emails or to call the IT department
if anything unusual is identified.

3.8.7 Kill Chain
Kill chain is not relevant for this threat: this is a “composite” threat consists of many cyberthreats
spanning all the phases of the kill chain, just as cyber espionage.

Insider threat
3.9.1 Description of the cyberthreat
The insider threat may exist within every company or organisation. Any current or former employee,
partner or contractor that has or used to have access to the organisation’ digital assets, may intentionally
or unintentionally abuse this access. The three most common types of insider threats are the - malicious
insider - who acts intentionally - the negligent insider - who is just sloppy or does not comply with the
policies and security instructions and the - compromised insider - who acts unintentionally as the means
for the true attacker314. All these three types of insider threats must be studied in depth, as the
acknowledgement of their existence and their modus operandi should define the organisation’s strategy
for security and data protection.
Analysis concludes that the insider threat trend decreased in 2018315 mainly due to the infrequent publicly
disclosure of incidents from inside the organizations.

3.9.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points for the insider threat are as follows:


Insider threat perception changed with GDPR. In 2018, the number of reported incidents with insider
threat reduced compared with previous years. This can be justified by the way these incidents are now
classified, shifting to data breaches with the introduction of GDPR.315.
 The GDPR compliance rally within the EU is also changing the perception of handling data breaches
originated from insider threat incidents in the US316. In the realm of EU GDPR, the new California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will get into effect on January 1, 2019317.

3.9.3 Trends and main statistics


Over half (60,8%) of the insider threat incidents impacting US Federal Organisations involved fraud,
with an average financial impact between US $75.712 and US $317.551. Only in 2018, three fraud
incidents (9,4%) resulted in a financial impact of ca. US $1 million318.



Ca. 44% of the payload for the User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) within an organisation
came from insider threats315.



Ca. 70% of the Chinese companies were relying on User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) for
insider threats315.



Ca. 50,6% of the healthcare organisations and 47,3% of medium-sized companies (up to 250
employees) rated the insider threat as their primary security concern315.



Ca. 77% of the companies’ data breaches are caused by insiders319.

Figure 22: Types of insider threats and their risk level324

According to a study conducted with cybersecurity experts working for companies or organisations,
phishing (67%) is the biggest weakness in the case of unintentional insider threats. Weak or reused
passwords (56%), unlocked devices (44%), password sharing practice (44%) and unsecured WiFi networks
(32%) were also part of the list. The study also revealed that the main reason that makes the company
they work for vulnerable to insider threats, is the excessive access privileges given to many employees323.

3.9.6 Specific mitigation actions
Specific actions for the insider threat contain the following elements:


Implement human behaviour-driven data loss prevention (DLP) software by applying user activity
monitoring, behaviour analytics and forensics in order to increase the effectiveness of a traditional



Apply the 80/20 rule for the company’s resources319. A company or an organization facing a security
incident must not exhaust its available resources; a part of the resources must become available for
other incidents taking place simultaneously (the case where one incident is the smokescreen for a
more serious attack) or for recovery.



Implement a Single-Sign-On (SSO) access for the company’s applications326.



Implement a multifactor authentication method326.



Define a security policy addressing insider threats, particulary based on user awareness, one of the
most effective controls for this type of cyberthreat.



Use identity and access management (IAM) solutions by also implementing segregation of duties (e.g.
according to defined roles).

Physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss
3.10.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Although physical attacks are not a real cyberthreat, they are still possible within businesses today.
Physical attacks may not be as popular as other types of cyberthreats, they can still lead to data breaches
(even in a less subtle way). Companies are increasingly concerned about the data residing within the
devices and most specifically about the loss of PII data and Intellectual Property, especially in the age of
GDPR. Although storage encryption would suffice to mitigate major risks of physical attacks, the number
of companies that have a consistent enterprise-wide encryption strategy is stable. Finally, physical access
to a device still gives the opportunity to attackers to conduct their malicious activities, e.g. ATM fraud and
POS attacks.

3.10.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points for physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss are as follows:


Digital theft has overtaken physical theft with respect to corporate fraud327. Physical theft of assets
was the most prevalent type of corporate fraud for the last 10 years. However, information theft, loss,
or attack has been reported in 2017 as the most prevalent type of fraud compared to physical theft.



The widespread adoption of cloud storage. A recent reported indicated that 80% of organisations are
already using cloud storage and file sharing services while 16% of organisations are planning to use
them in the next couple of years328. The aforementioned widespread adoption of cloud storage results
in a limited number of reported physical thefts by major companies329.



The GDPR effect. The GDPR330 is relevant to organisations that handle personal data in a digital as well
as physical format. Recent privacy regulations have increased the compliance-driven activities and thus,
taking into account the potential fines outlined, companies will be interested in investing more in
information security331. GDPR is expected to have a direct impact on improving the physical security of
organisations.



The slow progress in storage encryption technologies. According to a survey327: establishing a storage
encryption solution is one of the most effective controls in data protection, for many managers from
the surveyed companies. The survey identified that only 43% of the companies currently have a
consistent enterprise-wide encryption strategy332. The aforementioned percentage is the same as last
year indicating slow progress for wider adoption of encrypted storage practices. Compliance with
regulations is a significant driver for deploying encryption technologies according to half of the surveyed
companies. Finally, according to a research327, physical theft or loss of Intellectual Property is a top
concern for executives. A fact that will definitely help towards a wider adoption and deployment of
storage encryption technologies.



Consumers care more about lost data rather than lost devices. 57% of the people that lost a personal
device were mostly concerned about the data (pictures, documents, messages, etc.) residing within the
gadget rather than the gadget itself333.



Locations of theft. The victim’s work area or employee’s private vehicles were the most common
locations of theft334 followed by theft in airports and hotels335.



Assets lost or stolen. Paper documents and laptops are the most prevalent assets found in physical
theft or loss incidents334.



Physical security policies and controls. According to survey conducted by an industry player polling IT
professionals across different sectors, almost one-third of the organisations lack a physical security
policy to protect laptops and mobile devices335. It also concluded that, 42% of the organisations have
fully implemented different security measures for the physical security of critical IT systems336.
Moreover, more than half of the organisations do not utilize physical locks to secure IT equipment335.



ATM physical attacks on the rise. During 2017, almost 3.600 physical attacks against banking ATMs
were reported in Europe337. An increase of 73% is therefore observed compared to 2012 and 20%
compared to 2016. The European Association for Secure Transactions (EAST) reported that “black box”
attacks in Europe increased 307% compared to 2016338. Finally, the increase of “ATM jackpotting”
attacks in US is another indication of a trend with physical attacks against banking ATMs334.

the reported data breaches in the retail sector334. Petrol stations terminals are the major target of
payment card skimmers in the retail sector (in 87% of the reported card skimming attacks)334.

3.10.3 Trends and main statistics


According to Verizon334, 11% of reported data breaches involved physical actions.



TrendMicro339 reported that 16% of data breaches were caused by physical loss. ITRC reported that
physical theft is the root cause of 4,5% of data breaches and 0,8% of records stolen within 2017340.



Barkly reported that the theft of information assets is the third most costly consequence of successful
endpoint attacks after IT/end-user productivity loss and system downtime341.



Healthcare, Public and Financial sectors are the top sectors for data breaches reported, due to physical
theft or loss334.



25% of data breaches in the financial sector are due to the loss or theft of devices as well as the major
cause for data leakages (taking into account the sensitivity of financial and customer data stored)342.



46% of businesses feel vulnerable for the exposure to risks coming from mobile device loss343.



UK’s data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) reported that 20% of data
security incidents recorded between January and June 2017 were due to the physical theft or loss344.
While the majority of the incidents resulted from the loss or theft of paperwork (14% of reported data
security incidents), the loss of unencrypted devices is the cause of 5% of reported data security
incidents.



44% of organisations find it challenging to deploy encryption technologies while 34% find it difficult to
classify which are their critical data that need to be encrypted332.

The overall trend of physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss attacks in 2018 is STABLE.

3.10.4 Specific mitigation actions


Use of encryption in all information storage and flow that is outside the security perimeter (devices,
networks, cloud services, etc.). This will eliminate the impact from this threat.



Use asset inventories to keep track of user devices and remind owners to check availability.



Limit the access to areas with sensitive information or equipment.



Implement well-documented physical security policies and integrate physical security measures with
digital devices to obtain a holistic approach.



Consider using insurance to cover losses connected to both physical and related cyber- risks.



Develop user guides for mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) and use good practices345.



Establish well-communicated procedures for the physical protection of assets, covering the cases of
loss, damage and theft.



Consider transferring the risks from this threat to an insurance.



Put all necessary processes to reduce the time for the management of theft/damage/loss incidents.

Information Leakage
3.11.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Information leakage is one of the significant cyberthreats covering a wide variety of compromised
information, from personal data collected by internet enterprises and online services to business data
stored in IT infrastructures.
When security breaches become headlines on bulletins, blogs, newspapers, and technical reports, the
focus is either on adversaries or on the catastrophic failure of cyber-defence processes and techniques.
However, the indisputable truth is that despite the impact or the scope of a breach, is usually caused by
an individual’s action, or by a process failure inside the organisation346. Occasionally, a technical error or a
misconfiguration may also cause a leak347. A recent report illustrates that unintended disclosure is the
profound reason for information leakage in 2018348.

The identified interesting points for information leakage are as follows:


Geopolitics become an even stronger jigsaw puzzle. Information leakages often drive bi-lateral
agreements352. Targeted or nation-state sponsored attacks are multiplying resulting in information
disclosures353.



A busted myth. The most reported reasons for information leakage are hacking and malware,
however, device losses still count for ca. 50% of all breaches354.



Users voluntarily forget their PII ownership. In some cases, the digital services’ privacy policies drive
users to waive ownership interest in their data voluntarily and, therefore, consent to data disclosures.
Hence, the services operators may be able to benefit by ‘monetising’ this data355,356,357,358,359.



Human error is the most crucial factor for data disclosure360.



Governmental organizations take the majority of data leakage incidents. Approximately 60% of data
leakage incidents take place in government and education institutions, banks and healthcare
organisations360.

(according to GDPR) could see a 90-fold increase, from £1.4bn in 2015 to £122bn366.



The total amount of business data being stored is estimated to double every 12 to 18 months. Hence,
the potential data exfiltration is increasing accordingly366.



While the forensic costs are often less when data is unintentionally disclosed, the cost to insurers can
still be substantial due to the high notification and credit monitoring costs366.



Internal actors are 29% of those who are involved in data disclosures. In detail, 26% of the internal
actors are system administrators, 22% are end-users, 12% are doctors or nurses and 22% are others367.



16% of any data disclosure is due to miscellaneous errors, 13% due to privilege misuse and 7% due to
lost or stolen assets367.

The overall trend of information leakage in 2018 is INCREASING.

3.11.4 Top data leaks incidents


In January, information collected by the mobile fitness tracking and sharing app Strava has highlighted
the locations of secret Russia, UK, and US military bases in Syria and Afghanistan. The personal fitness
tracker Fitbit, linked to the user’s Strava accounts revealed the information368.



The marketing and data aggregation firm Exactis left about 340 million records exposed on a publicly



In late summer, a Chinese hotel chain exposed the data of ca. 130 million customers including the
information about names, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account numbers, and booking
details 364.



In September, a security researcher found an exposed database containing customer records of
Veeam, a Swiss vendor of data backup recovery, and virtual infrastructure monitoring software. The
database was not password-protected, constituting an easy target for any malicious actor. The
compromised details included ca. 400 million email addresses and other records collected/created
over a period of four years between 2013 and 2017 364.



Sungy Mobile Ltd., one of the world’s leading mobile application developers, leaked the details on ca.
50 million consumers due to a misconfigured backup database364.



In mid-November, Google faced a significant incident from a routing protocol hijack which resulted in
the interception of network traffic and, thus, in an information leakage (i.e., Border Gateway Protocol
leak). In detail, the incident affected a Nigerian ISP (MainOne Inc.), peering at IXPN (Internet Exchange
Point of Nigeria) in Lagos where Google and China Telecom are also members. The incident occurred
when 212 network addresses, which aggregated more than 500 BGP announcements, were erroneously
rerouted over the Russian ISP TransTelecom, to China Telecom, toward the Nigerian ISP Main One372,373.

3.11.5 Specific attack vectors
The primary attack vector in information leakage is insiders. This term is often used to describe a person
with interest to exfiltrate important information on behalf of a third-party entity. Other common attack
vectors used by this threat are misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and human errors. For more information
on attack vectors, please see chapter 5 in this report.

3.11.6 Specific mitigation actions
The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements:


Anonymise, pseudonymise, minimise and encrypt data according to the provisions of the European
Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act374,375.
Always check the regulation commitments for counterpart entities who do not come under bi- or
multilateral initiatives376,377,378.



Identity Theft
3.12.1 Description of the cyberthreat
Identity theft is the fraud committed from the theft of personal identifiable information strengthened by
the massive digitisation of people’s personal data which most of the times, include information related to
their legal and civil substance383. Nowadays, bank accounts, home addresses, accounting records, health
records and a slew of other personal information stored in own devices or organization’s/companies’
databases and, they are, thus, vulnerable to cybercriminal activity.
Identity theft is a procedure rather than an isolated incident; the attackers need several elements of
personal information to accurately “build” a full profile of a particular person. Thus, identity theft
associated with various types of data such as health records, personal web accounts, bank account
information, personal information, and information of contacts. If this information “bits and pieces” is not
enough for a complete profile, the data is exchanged between attackers via the Dark Web384 , so that the
identity theft may be complete in the future.
The identity theft threat is strongly associated with data breaches in companies or organisations across all
industry sectors (Figure 31)385. Data breach attacks are in most cases targeting the company’s customer
records. The information leaked through these attacks may be sufficient for the next step, which is the
identity fraud. Since the average number of records breached in 2018 has increased by 2,2%386, it is safe
to conclude that the identity theft trend is also increasing in the reporting period.

3.12.2 Interesting points
The interesting points for this threat in the reporting period are as follows:




GDPR to the rescue388. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced
for all European Union’s public and private companies and organisations. The GDPR defines the rules
and requirements for regulators or processors to set personal data protection policies at the Member
States level and the failure of compliance may cost up to 4% of the annual company’s turnover in
penalties. Some of the policy elements include data encryption and the dual-factor authentication.
Additionally, the GDPR dictates a formal report of any data breach of the company’s assets to the
regional Data Protection Agency (DPA). The basic points of the GDPR are the following:
o

Describes the frame for handling EU residents’ data.

o

Enforces resident’s consent regarding data collection and use.

o

Defines the types of personal data that can be stored and used by the company/organisation.

o

Enforces the use of open file formats for data transferring.

o

Allows individuals to delete or rectify their data.

o

Requires a ‘liaison’ officer for the collaboration between the company/organisation and the DPA.

o

Enforces the formal reporting of breaches within a few days of the event.

Legitimate software extensions used in campaigns. In May 2018, the Unimania campaign389 was
revealed. It has been noticed that via popular Chrome extensions’ such as the Video Downloader for
Facebook (ca. 170.000 users), the PDF Merge (ca. 125.000 users) and others installed on this browser,
collected personal information based on user’s behaviour (i.e. posts, tweets, YouTube videos
watched, user IDs and location data). These extensions, developed with attention to detail, included
an End-User License Agreement (EULA). Although the developer is still unknown and more
importantly, who was the recipient of the intercepted information, the EULA mentioned the company
name Unimania, Inc. located in Tel-Aviv, Israel. An estimate indicates that more than 420.000 users
may have been affected by this incident.
In July 2018, the Big Star Labs campaign390 was also revealed. The Big Stars Labs was not distributed
only via Chrome but also via other legitimate software extensions, such as the Block Site (Android
application and Firefox extension with ca. 100.000 users each, Chrome extension with ca. 1,4 million
users), the AdBlockPrime and several more Android and iOS applications, Chrome and Firefox
extensions. The Big Star Labs campaign may have infected more than ca. 11 million users, 26 times
more users than the ones affected by Unimania.
As in the case of Unimania, also in the Big Star Labs campaign, it was not clear who were the targets.
However, certain parts of the embedded code pointed out the involvement of an Israel-based web
analytics company.



Open government has exposed citizens data. In September 2018, the US based news channel CNN
reported the exposure of people’s personal details (i.e. social security numbers, citizenship status,
criminal records) by the public portal FOIA.gov. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) portal of the
US Environmental Protection Agency, operating as an intermediate between citizens and

governmental agencies, processes personal information from applicants. A flaw on the FOIA.gov
complex of servers allowed unauthorized searches on FOIA’s records, without neither the agency’s
nor the applicant’s permission. CNN alerted the US Environmental Protection Agency, which then
fixed the issue and stopped the exposure. A similar situation took place in August 2016, when the
Kennesaw State University, authorized to support the elections, exposed voters’ registration data.
The USA is not the only country that faced this type of incident in 2018. In March 2018, a software
flaw in a third-party site for the Canadian government leaked ca. 7.000 documents and in August, the
UK government exposed data found by Google. In the same month, more than ca. 2,3 million Mexican
healthcare records were exposed due to a database misconfiguration391.

3.12.3 Trends and main statistics


10% of the UK healthcare organisations have been breached more than 10 times in the last year392.



3% of the T-mobile customers’ records (2,3 million individuals) were breached in August 2018393. The
customers’ personal information, such as name, billing address, and account number were stolen.



The cost of fraud for 2018 only for the USA is estimated to exceed US $7.4 billion, a 32% growth of the
recorded US $5.6 billion cost in 2016383.



38% of the organisations have cloud user accounts that were compromised394.



More than five employee identities where spoofed in each case of the 57% of the targeted companies
(10% more companies than the year before)395.



30% more phishing links were detected in social media396.



141% increase in North America, 22% decrease in Europe and 36% decrease in Asia, in compromised

3.12.4 Top identity theft threats


Skimmers. An identity theft method where fraudsters place devices (known as skimmers) over card
readers at registers checkout, gas stations or ATMs. Skimmers store credit and debit card information
so fraudsters can use this data to make counterfeit cards, use them for online purchases or sell them
on the black market400.



Dumpster divers. Fraudsters dig through trash or mailboxes, looking for bank statements, copies of
tax returns and other documents that have personal information401.



Telephone impersonators. Fraudsters may contact a bank's call center many times, each time gaining
a different piece of information until they have enough information to impersonate an actual bank
customer and gain account access402.



Network administrator impersonators. A new form of identity theft targeting network
administrators’ accounts, is performed by attackers in an attempt to circumvent mitigation tools and
policies and access the company’s database. By the use of legitimate network tools, such as
applications for remote access or remote back-ups, the attacker was able to steal the administrator’s
identity and operate as the legitimate administrator within the company’s network. This style of
attacking, namely the malwareless attacks, exceeded 49% of this year’s data breach incidents. 388.



Phishers and spear-phishers. Phishers use authentic-looking emails and websites to trick users to
click on a link or open an attachment that will download malware onto their computers and leave
confidential information vulnerable403. In a targeted phishing attack (spear-phishing), the attacker is

not interested in just stealing personal information, but also on taking over the control of the
computer or the network that the computer is connected.

3.12.5 Specific attack vectors






The cloud as an attack interface for customers’ data. Although companies and organizations are
accountable for the safekeeping of customers’ personal information, a gap is revealed since most of
the times, a part of the company’s digital assets are stored in cloud services or virtual machines.
In the case of cloud computing, the company would face financial and legal consequences even in
cloud provider’s data breaches. Most providers have security policies and tools, but, still, the
company that hosts its digital assets in a provider’s infrastructure has no control over them. It has
been reported that 73% of the cloud providers had misconfigurations in their security policies that
could lead to a data breach394.
Moreover, attacks on the cloud infrastructure are highly profitable, therefore attractive to hackers
and cyber criminals, making them extremely likely.
Phishing tools. The group of cyber criminals mostly focused on the theft of identity’s information is the
phishers. Some of the main tactics404 that were used by phishers to intercept user credentials were:
o

Domain squatting. Fraudulent domains that are similar to a valid one, for example,
0racle[dot]com.

o

Domain shadowing. Fraudulent subdomains hidden in a valid domain, for example,
shadow[dot]oracle[dot]com.

o

Malicious domains. Domains that lure users to register and via the registration intercept personal
information.

o

URL shorteners. A shortened URL is used to hide the domain. Shorteners are used by valid
domains, for example goo[dot]gl and the users are familiarized with this trend. This assists the
phishers to pass their shorteners as valid.

o

Subdomain services. A malicious site in a valid domain server, for example
malicious[dot]blogspot[dot]com.

These URLs are either intercepting random visitors or are sent via email to lure specific individuals or
groups of users. For more information about phishing and spear-fishing, please refer to section 3.6.


W2 scam. The W2 scam is another attack aiming at companies’ records to access sensitive
information. The scam starts by spoofing an executive member of finance or HR department for
employees’ records. These records are then used for identity theft. The scam is named after the US
W2 tax form used to report employee’s wages. This social engineering scam, although old (first
reported in 2016 by IRS), is resurfacing with an increase of 10% more incidents than last year395.



Email fraud. In this type of attack (also known as Business Email Compromise or BEC) the sender of
the email impersonates an executive member of the company or a partner organization and asks for
sensitive information. It is just a query-mail, which makes it harder to detect in advance or prevent it.
However, the attackers tend to use specific keywords on the mail’s subject that gives a hint of the
type of information they are after. The most common keywords are ‘Payment’, ‘Request’, ‘Urgent’,
and ‘FYI’. The companies and organisations that are mostly targeted by BEC are retail, healthcare and
government organisations396.

ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019



LokiPWS. Although LokiPWS (also known as Loki Bot) is a malware, it is also used as a password
stealer. This technique also applies to other malware such as Pony, Emotet, KeyBase and AZORult397.
For more information about the use of malware for identity theft, please refer to the section 3.1.



Software and hardware vulnerabilities. Hard- software vulnerabilities may leave the user’s data
exposed. Some of the vulnerabilities recorded in 2018, which were associated with identity theft, are
the CVE-2018-14787 of Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) devices that allowed interception of
the patient’s medical information405, the CVE-2018-11776 of Apache Struts software and the CVE2018-7445 of MicroTik RouterOS that both allowed remote code execution and several exploits have
been used406,407.

3.12.6 Specific mitigation actions


Sensitive information such as patient records should not be stored in handwritten notes to prevent
loss or misplacement384. It is better to give digital files a small lifespan and then to destroy them
effectively.



Apply ‘threat hunting’ within a company to strengthen the security plans. Threat hunting392 is
conducted by skilled members of the Security Operation Centre (SoC) team to proactively identify
vulnerabilities and prevent breaches.



Introduce policies such as velocity-based rules to mitigate identity fraud, especially for payment card
transactions383. The machine data of valid transactions can provide sufficient information for the
optimal policy definition.



Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication methods, when available, allowing a user to access
several applications with the same set of digital credentials. It is highly recommended to minimize the
number of user’s accounts and the stored credentials408.



Introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to overcome the password hacking or loss and ensure
the authentication process with multiple keys. The adaptive MFA optimizes the authentication
process based on user’s behaviour and context408.



Produce compulsory checks to URLs that are sent via email or randomly visited, before any further
step is taken404. Checks based on IP address, the ASN that associates with the IP, the owner of the
domain and the relation between this domain and others.



Organizations that are adopting cloud services should have strong cloud security operations and
prefer an architecture of on-premises storages, private cloud storages and public cloud storages
simultaneously to protect their customer’s personal information394.



Implement the use of strong and updated encryption methods for sensitive data such as TLS 1.3 (uses
ephemeral keys), to prevent hacking394.



Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or digital ones) against unauthorised
access.



Identity information should not be disclosed to unsolicited recipients and their requests by phone,
email or in person.



Password protect devices, ensure good quality of credentials, and secure methods for their storage.



Users should pay attention when using public Wi-Fi networks, as fraudsters hack or mimic them. If
one is used, it should be avoided accessing sensitive applications and data. A trusted VPN service
should be used when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks.



Transactions documented by means of bank statements or received receipts should be checked
regularly upon irregularities.



Content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, emails with malicious content, spam and
unwanted network traffic should be installed.



Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also block execution of files
appropriately (e.g. block execution in Temp folder).



Ensure good quality of credentials and secure methods for their storage.



Use of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions.

Cryptojacking
3.13.1 Description of the cyberthreat
2018 can be characterized as the year of cryptojacking409. Cryptojacking (also known as cryptomining) is a
new term that refers to the programs that use the victim's device processing power (CPU or GPU410) to
mine cryptocurrencies without the victim's consent. This processing power is used to solve cryptographic
puzzles that are recorded in the blockchain. The Cybercrime-as-a-Service sector is always innovative and
looking for new ways to generate revenue411 and to apply the "follow-the-money" principle: cyber
criminals take advantage of the victims' processing power (usually 70% to 80% unused processing
power412) to mine cryptocurrencies and earn real world money, monetized after legal exchanges and
transactions.

3.13.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points for cryptojacking threats are as follows:


Shift from ransomware to cryptojacking458. Since the fourth quarter of 2017, a clear trend for cyber
criminals to move from ransomware413 to cryptomining as the preferred way to make profit242 has
been observed. The spike in the value of Bitcoin and the fact that cryptocurrencies became a
mainstream feature of society414, encouraged cyber criminals to target cryptocurrencies (via
cryptomining or stealing users' cryptocurrency) for various reasons. First, cryptojacking is simpler and
more straightforward due to the low barrier for entry (e.g. a couple of source code lines is enough for
a browser based cryptominer)244. Second, it is less risky, stable and a less disruptive way to make
money while it allows cyber criminals to fly under the user radar since the latter are not prompted to
make any payment and may not notice the cryptomining activity. Third, every system can potentially
be a victim (including fully patched systems)248. Fourth, they have attracted minimal law enforcement
attention242. Finally, monetization is easier for the cyber criminals since no intermediary and no fraud
schemes are required.



The prevalence of anonymity cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin became the most popular cryptocurrency415,
however, many new cryptocurrencies have been developed416. Most notable of alternative
cryptocurrencies are Monero417 418, Ethereum419 and Zcash420 as they provide higher levels of
transaction anonymity for cyber criminals compared to Bitcoin. They can also be mineable in a
distributed way, which matches with the modus operandi of cyber criminals (via infected

machines/bots)421. Monero has been by far the most preferred cryptocurrency as it has much lower
“difficulty rate” for mining compared to Bitcoin422. XMRig423 open source Monero mining software has
been one of the most popular mining programs used by cyber criminals455. Finally, Monero miners
have also been leveraged by advanced threat groups like Lazarus424 and Iron Tiger425.


The economics of cryptojacking. During the first half of 2018, it was estimated that cryptominers
have monetized for their users more than US $2.5 billion455. Smominru mining botnet that has
infected more than 500.000 Windows machines has already mined Monero, valued between US
$2.8M and US $3.6M426. It was estimated that an adversary controlling 2.000 victim computer systems
with Monero miners could generate US $500 per day or US $182.500 per year427.



Cryptocurrencies’ market price and cryptojacking detections correlation. During the past 12 months,
it has been observed that the trend in cryptominers closely follows the money flow and valuation of
cryptocurrency market prices428. The figure below presents a positive correlation between Bitcoin’s
market price and the detections of cryptojacking malware. One can assess (with moderate
confidence) that a potential big increase or decrease in the cryptocurrencies’ market price could
directly influence the numbers of cryptominer detections428.



Drive-by cryptomining. Cryptomining can be browser-based using technologies such as JavaScript430
and WebAssembly431 (a newer browser technology that is faster and more efficient than JavaScript).
Since Coinhive432 released its JavaScript based technologies in September 2017, it has been injected
into thousands of websites455 by cyber criminals and website administrators (usually this happens via
3rd party websites435). It is reported that 2,2% of the top 100 Alexa433 websites have been found to use
cryptomining scripts242. Coinhive is also marketed as an alternative way for websites to make revenue
instead of using ads248. It is understood that many Coinhive copycats have emerged due to Coinhive’s
success416. Finally, a major advance in web-based cryptomining is a new technique for persistent
mining that maintains the process running even after the browser window is closed434.



Cryptomining capabilities in existing trojans and botnets. During the reporting period, we have
observed existing trojans and botnets to incorporate cryptomining capabilities435. Examples of such
trend include TrickBot436, Dridex435, Neutrino437 and CodeFork/Gamarue438. Malware authors can
effortlessly and quickly push these cryptomining capabilities into their existing malware in order to
make more profit.



Cryptojacking hits cloud’s high-powered resources. Cryptojacking is one of the major issues found in
cloud environments as 25% of organisations have been affected439. The recent incident with
cryptojacking activity in the cloud environments of Telsa440, Aviva, Gemalto441 and LA Times442 are
indicative of the trend. Moreover, cloud threats also include cryptomining via Docker and
Kubernetes443 as well as hacked serverless functions444.



Cryptojacking goes mobile. Although mobile devices do not have the processing power of PCs,
cryptomining is an emerging threat with overall growth for mobile devices458. Cryptominers have

managed to enter Google Play445 and Apple’s App Store446 and thus subsequently banned by Google447
and Apple448. During the reporting period, we have observed malicious multi-featured mobile apps449
(having capabilities from DDoS, adware, banking trojan to cryptomining) that can brick mobile
devices450.


Cryptojacking in critical infrastructure. In February 2018, the first incident of cryptomining malware
that was found in SCADA systems of a water utility451, connected to the Internet has been reported.
This incident was not unique as the numbers in the figure below present. Moreover, this worrying
overall trend for critical infrastructure can have impact on the stability and responsiveness of the
operations of such systems452.

Figure 35: Share of ICS computers attacked by cryptomining malware452



Cryptojacking and law enforcement. Cryptojacking activity has attracted limited law enforcement
attention since the beginning of the reporting period242. This comes as a result of the questionable
legality of this activity (browser cryptomining is not illegal), the limited reporting of such crimes as
well as due to the fact the victim’s damages are hard to quantify and investigate242. It is expected that
more cases of illegal cryptomining will reach to law enforcement this year, given the prevalence and
exploitation of this threat453.

3.13.3 Trends and main statistics


During the 1st quarter of 2018, cryptojacking malware grew 629%244 (from 400.000 samples in the
fourth quarter of 2017 to 2,9 million samples in the first quarter of 2018)248.



Cryptocurrency mining continues to rise as one can observe from the figure below:

Figure 36: Half-year comparison of cryptocurrency mining detections339



The distribution of cryptominers by operating system during 2017 was as follows: Windows miners
(55,44%), browser miners (44,13%), Linux miners (0,25%), Android miners (0,15%) and macOS miners
(0,03%)454. During the first quarter of 2018 the distribution of cryptominers by operating systems was:
Windows miners (84,69%), browser miners (15,06%), Android miners (0,17%), Linux miners (0,07%)
and macOS miners (0,01%)454. The above numbers show that Windows is the cryptomining platform
of choice for cyber criminals.



During the first half of 2018, cryptominers have affected 42% of organisations globally compared to
20,5% at the end of 2017455.



It is estimated that Bitcoin cryptomining consumes globally per year the same amount of energy as to
Switzerland’s total annual energy consumption456,457.



The amount of cryptocurrency mining is also dependent on the number of cryptojacking victims. From
April 2017 to March 2018, the number of these victims were ca. 400.000 to 600.000 per month458.



An increase in cryptominer detections has been observed on Mac computers, mostly on consumer
hardware. 60% of the detections mentioned above, during 2017, have been attributed to
JS.Webcoinminer variants248.



On the Dark Web one can purchase a cryptomining toolkit with just US $30248.



The rise of “insider miners” is something that is expected to come as we see more and more examples
of employees using their organisations (super) computers for their own profit459.

The overall trend for cryptojacking attacks in 2018 is INCREASING.

3.13.4 Top 5 cryptojacking threats
During the first half of 2018 the top cryptomining malware455 globally is as follows:


Coinhive432 (30%),



Cryptoloot460 (23%),



Jsecoin461 (17%),



XMRig423 (7%) and



Authedmine462 (6%).

It is interesting to see that apart from XMRig, that is file-based cryptominer, all the others are browserbased.

3.13.5 Specific attack vectors
Cyber criminals have used the following techniques to deliver cryptominers:


by incorporating cryptojacking capabilities in existing malware435 and botnets463 464;



via drive-by cryptomining465 and compromised websites248;



via browser extensions466;



via spam467.












Implement content filtering to screen out unwanted attachments, emails with malicious content and
spam.
From a network perspective, organisations should implement filtering of the Stratum mining protocol
as well as blacklisting the IP addresses and domains of popular mining pools435.
Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also blocking execution of files (e.g.
block execution in Temp folder).
Conduct regular security audits on corporate networks looking for anomalies.
Implement robust vulnerability and patch management.
Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the end-points.
Invest in user awareness especially with regard to secure browsing behaviour.
Identify your external exposure; Internet connected systems should have proper access control for
management ports, should be fully patched and continuously monitored for abuse/misuse.
Less obvious targets, such as queue management systems, POS terminals, and even vending machines
can be hijacked to mine cryptocurrencies. Make sure they are patched at least against Eternal Blue
exploit.
Implement process monitoring and blacklisting of common cryptomining executables.

Ransomware
3.14.1 Description of the cybe-threat
Ransomware attacks have been committed against a vast variety of organisations every year by financially
motivated attackers for more than a decade474. The ransomware attacker gains ownership of files and/or
various devices and blocks the real owner from accessing them. To return the ownership the attacker
demands a ransom in cryptocurrency475.
Ransomware attacks are nowadays evolving from stand-alone to cyber-adversary campaigns. This
morphing is mostly due to the level of sophistication of attackers, often elevated by leaked or stolen
classified tools developed by government agencies476. The victims of these attacks not only suffer certain
financial losses, but they also lose their credibility. This motivates the existence of an accurate and
updated prediction and prevention plan within every organization.
According to several security researchers groups, there has been a decrease in ransomware incidents this
year, while an increase in cryptocurrency mining attacks has been observed475. In cryptocurrency mining,
the attacker is more focused on assuming the control of the machine’s computational power and
producing currency units indefinitely, than being paid a ransom amount once. For more information
about cryptojacking, please consult chapter 3.13.
Even though the ransomware landscape is changing, many sectors still suffer from these attacks. For
example, over than 85% of the malware targeting medical devices in 2018 was ransomware477.
Additionally, 973 out of a total of 30.362 security breach incidents (3,2%) in all sectors was due to
ransomware478. This keeps ransomware as a threat that cannot be ignored.

3.14.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points for ransomware are as follows:


From ransomware to cryptojacking. In early 2018, a trend towards cryptojacking rather than
ransomware attacks has been observed. In cryptojacking, the intruders invade a computer in a way
similar to ransomware, but instead of demanding a ransom, they install malicious software to start
cryptocurrency mining without the computer owner’s noticing. The first indication was that, although
the coin mining software (coin miners) known samples were approximately 400.000 in Q4 2017, they
grew to more than 2,9 million in Q1 2018. Only in the first half (H1) of 2018, the cryptocurrency
mining detections increased by 96% compared to the total detections recorded in 2017479.
Cryptojacking is simpler and less risky for the attackers who begin to monetise on the victim’s system
without any delay or without risking the victim’s denial. In Q1 2018, Lazarus, an international

cybercrime group responsible for several ransomware attacks since 2016, deployed a cryptocurrency
scheme called HaoBao480.


Ransomed medical devices: an ongoing threat. As predicted in the past478, this year more than 85%
of all the malware that affected healthcare organizations was ransomware. Unfortunately, the
healthcare sector provides an easy target to attackers due to the usual lack of integration between IT
policies and the core hospital operations. Additionally, the nature of such organisations in many cases
forces them to give in to ransom demands, putting a swift end to the attack. These reasons make the
healthcare organisations appealing to ransomware attackers.



Ransomware ‘DIY’ is now available for everyone. In most ransomware attacks, such as Cerber481, the
use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as a backdoor allows the attacker to gain access to the victim’s
computer. The sophistication of the criminal community on the use of RDP has reached a point that
criminals develop a ‘ransomware interface’ named WYSIWYE482. This interface allows users to select a
network computer to attack, a specific set of folders in a computer to lock, any email address to
contact or hack within the network, etc. Thus, it also allows someone to become a ransomware
criminal with minimum technical skills. This indicates that in the future, many more people with
considerably less sophistication will unleash ransomware attacks.



The Dark Web is recycling. Security Intelligence experts have shown that there is a trend of ‘open’ use
of malware by multiple threat actors. Their analysis counted more than 3 million registered Dark Web
users in 25 sites that are offering access to tools and information for attacks. The content shared was
considered sufficient for any wannabe attacker, regardless the technical knowledge or experience.
Noteworthy that, 12% of the available Dark Web material was ransomware-related. Moreover, the
cost for accessing the material is extremely low. This environment allows anyone with just a small
amount of money to be able to conduct attacks using already developed tools and methods483. This
trend of “sharing” malicious tools via the Dark Web has shifted the nature of ransomware attacks
from individuals to global groups of attackers. Such coordinated attacks provided the tools used to
target the Ohio Police and Fire Department and the Minnesota Psychiatric in June 2018479, where
both critical and personal services were compromised.



Nations are getting involved. The ransomware attack campaigns WannaCry and NotPetya, organized
by nation-state actors, were initiated in 2017 and continued throughout 2018. In both cases, the main
goal of the attacks was the destruction of information or just causing a distraction rather than
receiving a specific ransom. This demonstrates that in nation-state attacks the recovery may not be a
possibility for the victims. Although the attacks were allegedly orchestrated by a state, in many cases
the actor was a malicious individual or a group - the Lazarus group delivered the WannaCry campaign
organized by the North Korean state479. This use of ransomware may indicate a future trend where
governments or regimes get actively involved in the cyberwarfare.

3.14.3 Trends and main statistics

3.14.4 Top ransomware threats


WannaCry is a ransomworm that is based on the combination of technically simple exploits namely
the EternalBlue (developed by the NSA496), the DoublePulsar and cryptocurrency miners. WannaCry is
replicated without any human interference and spreads from one computer to others on the same
network. A global WannaCry attack targeting healthcare organisations started in May 2017 and
managed to infect more than 200.000 computers spread in 150 countries474, including systems of the
National Health Services of Great Britain496. It was estimated that more than 312 ransom payments
were made for WannaCry attacks497. The Boeing aircraft manufacturing company suffered a
WannaCry attack in March 2018498. In many cases, WannaCry has been used by regimes in search of
funding in foreign currency or in cryptocurrency 490.



GandCrab was used for the first time in January 2018 and infected more than 50.000 systems in less
than a month. Since then, GandCrab is taking the lead on ransomware attacks; it was the secondhighest detected ransomware globally from March to July 2018499. It operates similarly to Locky481 and
Jaff481, as it is based on malicious macros hidden in files which in turn are delivered as email

attachments. However, the GandCrab ransom payments are done on Dash rather than on Bitcoin
cryptocurrency480. GandCrab has been developed based on the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
model and allows the developers and criminals to share the profit500. GandCrab targeted mostly
Scandinavian and English-speaking countries501.


NotPetya or Nyetya first arrived in June 2017. It is a combination of the EternalBlue and the
EternalRomance exploits and it also includes a credential harvesting code476. NotPetya was first
unleashed in the Ukraine infecting more than 1 million computers in 2.000 different companies497.
NotPetya in most cases was used as a disk wiper after stealing data, disguising the attacker’s true
motive: the data490.



SamSam, a highly sophisticated ransomware that first appeared in 2015, is still used with high
amounts of money stolen as ransom. The attackers using SamSam are specifically keen on hiding any
digital trace of their actions and avoid investigation. The SamSam encryption tool renders thoroughly
the victim’s data files and in most cases, the recovery is impossible even by reimaging or reinstalling
the software. More than US $6 million where lost due to SamSam in India during these past three
years502. SamSam incidents affected healthcare and government organizations in 2018 such as the city
of Atlanta (US $17 million damage in recovery cost), the LabCorp. and the Colorado Department of
Transportation (US $1,5 million damage in recovery costs)503.



Lokibot is a banking Trojan and info-stealer targeting smart mobile devices with Android OS.
However, Lokibot is also used for ransomware on mobiles because it allows the attacker to lock the
device. Lokibot was among the three ‘most wanted’ mobile malware in the first half of 2018504.



PyLocky first appearance in August 2018, delivered via spam email, targeting European countries505.
PyLocky has certain similarities with Locky481, for example, the same ransom note. However, the main
difference is the programing language (Python) used in writing the packaged executables. PyLocky
features advanced capabilities such as anti-machine learning.



BlackRuby is a new attack that combines ransomware and cryptojacking and was first used in
February 2018. The attacker locates the victim’s position by utilizing API to achieve better decryption
pricing and initiates XMRig CPU miner at the same time506.



CryptoWall first appeared in late 2015 victimizing hundreds of computers of a major South East Asian
company490. CryptoWall has so far more than 36.000 victims who paid more than US $18 million in
ransoms488. CryptoWall was being delivered via existing drive-by downloads in compromised websites
and not via an emailed attachment.

3.14.5 Specific attack vectors
One of the reasons why individuals, companies or organisations are vulnerable to ransomware attacks is
the use of outdated or unpatched software and operating systems474. The vulnerabilities of the OS or the
software, if not treated, may be exploited in a ransomware incident.
The most recent vulnerabilities with an association to the ransomware threat are the CVE‐2018‐8174507
that was exploited by the GandCrab508 and the Magniber505, the CVE-2018-14787 of Philips IntelliSpace
Cardiovascular (ISCV) that may leave exposed critical patient’s clinical information509, the CVE2018-7600
that is exploited by the XMRig CPU miner in the BlackRubby ransomware510 , the CVE-2018-4878 exploited
by the GandCrab511 and the CVE-2018-1010, CVE-2018-1012, CVE-2018-1013, CVE-2018-1015, CVE-20181016 vulnerabilities of the Flexera Software512.

3.14.6 Specific mitigation actions
Specific actions for mitigating a ransomware attack are the following:


Implement the use of network segmentation, data encryption, access control, and policy enforcement
for minimum exposure of data476.



Implement the use of methods such as monitoring for fast identification of infections476.



Monitor the access and status of the public infrastructure used497.



Assure the existence of a Security Operation Centre (SOC) manned with skilled security staff within
every organisation or company486.



Implement the use of appropriate and updated tools for ransomware prevention486.



Define and implement a minimum set of user data access rights in order to minimize the impact of
attacks (i.e. less rights, less data encrypted).



Introduce a reliable back-up off-line scheme that is tested and is in a position to recover user data in a
timely manner.



Implement a robust vulnerability and patch management system.



Implement a content filtering solution to filter unwanted attachments, emails with malicious content,
spam and unwanted network traffic.



Install an end-point protection solution by means of anti-virus programs but also blocking execution
of files (e.g. block execution in Temp folder).



Introduce policies to control external devices and port-accessibility.



Implement whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the end-points.



Invest in user awareness especially in the promotion of secure browsing behaviour.

Cyber Espionage
3.15.1 Description of the cyberthreat
During the reporting period, various reports from global security research organisations revealed that
cyber espionage (or else “nation-state-sponsored”) is becoming increasingly popular among certain
nation states514. This threat typically targets industrial sectors, critical and strategic infrastructures across
the world including government entities, railways, telecommunication providers, energy companies,
hospitals and banks513,514,515. Cyberespionage focuses on driving geopolitics, stealing state and trade
secrets, intellectual property rights and proprietary information in strategic fields. It also mobilises actors
from the economy, industry, foreign intelligence services, as well as actors who work on their
behalf516,517,518,519,520,521. In a recent report517, threat intelligence analysts were not surprised to learn that
71% of the organizations are treating cyber espionage and other threats as a "black box" and are still
growing and expanding their knowledge over them.
During the reporting period, the number of nation-state-sponsored cyberattacks that focused primarly on
the economy has grown, and is likely to continue this way. In detail, nation-state-sponsored and other
adversary-driven attacks on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are increasing in the utilities, oil and
natural gas (ONG), and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, advanced persistent threat (APT)
cyberattacks indicate that many financial attacks are motivated by espionage. Using tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs) akin to their espionage counterparts, groups such as Cobalt Group, Carbanak and
FIN7 have allegedly been targeting large financial institutions and restaurant chains successfully.

3.15.2 Interesting points
The identified interesting points516,517,522 for cyber espionage are as follows:


The European Parliament’s Committee of the Foreign Affairs calls the Member States to establish a
cyber defence unit523 and to jointly work on their common defence524. The US President Trump calls
on “proactive offensive tactics” regarding the Homeland security544.



Cyber espionage groups and tools are becoming increasingly attractive among government officials
forming a new open-market area525.



Vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the
Internet-of-Things (IoT) generate interest among nation-states to support cyber-espionage activities
through exploitation. A recent report disclosed a letter from the Israeli government addressed to USbased exploit developers inquiring about “advanced Vulnerabilities R&D and zero-day exploits for the
use of its law enforcement and security agencies for a wide variety of target platforms and
technologies”526.



Nation-states use various means to anonymise attacks making attribution extremely difficult.



Threat actors motivated by financial, political, or ideological gain will increasingly focus attacks on
supplier networks with weaker cybersecurity programs. Cyber espionage adversaries have slowly
shifted their attack patterns to exploiting third- and fourth-party supply chain partners.



Software supply chain infiltration threatens the critical infrastructure sector and is poised to threaten
other sectors.



Weak foreign laws could enable Intellectual Property theft. For example, when US companies do
business in China then valuable company data is stored in China and government approval is required
prior to transferring this data outside China. Another example is Russia who demands source code
reviews for all foreign technology being sold inside the country.



According to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), state-sponsored hackers employed by
hostile nations carry out most of the attacks. They are also tackling several phishing sites targeting
British consumers.



The UK has developed a new categorisation framework to ensure that the appropriate handler
manages an incident: C1 attacks are national emergencies; C2 attacks can have a serious impact on a
large portion of the population, economy or government; C3 attacks can have a serious impact on a
large organisation or wider government; C4 attacks could threaten a medium-sized organisation; C5
attacks include threats to a small organisation; C6 attacks on individuals and the response would be
led by law enforcement agencies, such as the local police force.



The United States is projected to be a net oil and gas exporter by 2022 and if this projection comes to
fruition, the United States will directly compete with Russia in the European market. Russian state
actors could sponsor disruptive or espionage-related cyber operations or support hacktivists in the
name of protecting the environment to contain this new competition in one of the largest energy
market.



Newly imposed sanctions on Iran are likely to push the country to intensify state-sponsored
cyberthreat activities in pursuit of its geopolitical and strategic objectives at a regional level,
particularly if Iran fails to keep its European counterparts committed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action (JCPOA) agreement.

3.15.3 Trends and main statistics
As figure 41 illustrates, cyber espionage decreased overall by ca. 2% in 2018527.

Figure 41: Distribution of attack motivations (2017-2018)528



66% of the oil and natural gas (ONG) IT managers said digitisation has made them more vulnerable to
espionage compromises517.



China, Russia, and Iran stand out as 3 of the most capable and active cyber actors tied to economic
espionage516,517.



87% of the security professionals believe that recent activity emanating from Russia, China, and North
Korea has made U.S. enterprise data less secure515.



43% of the security professionals believe that a potential attack by large nation-states is the greatest
threat to US critical infrastructure515.



The time spent by security professionals preventing attacks from cyber espionage or surveillance by
foreign governments or competitors decreased from 6% (2017) to 3% (2018)515. For the same threat, the
professionals’ concern has also decreased from 11% (2017) to 9% (2018)515.



Operational technology (OT) networks of industrial enterprises is a field of glory for espionage threat
actors. These actors use remote administrator tools (RATs) which are already installed in the industrial
control systems (ICS). A recent report529 reveals the top 20 countries in which RATs were used at least
once on espionage incidents during the H1 of 2018.



ZooPark is a cyber espionage operation which targets Android users in Asia and Middle East. ZooPark
can perform keylogging, steal GPS location and clipboard data (incl. audio, photos, text and data from
messaging apps). Several generations of this espionage malware are active since June 2015. ZooParck
incidents during the reporting are associated with the independence referendum in Kurdistan and
focused on victims in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran532.



FIN7 (also known as, Carbanak group and Cobalt) cyber espionage threat-group continues to
innovate, but it has been less active in 2018 compared with previous years. However, there are new
incidents of the Bateleur, HALFBAKED, BELLHOP malware, Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike BEACON in
2018517.



POWERSTATS malware family activity is on the rise and continuously evolving, as seen in targeted
attacks that have been dubbed “Muddy Water”. This threat group continuous to focus in West and
Southwest Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, most prominently in Saudi Arabia517.



PIPEFISH (aka OilRig) cyber espionage threat-group continues to be active and advancing its toolset.
This threat group has been mostly targeting Middle Eastern entities for surveillance and espionage
objectives in the energy sector517. Also, the PRB Backdoor, which targets companies in Egypt,
matching previous threat-actor interest in civil aviation organizations in the region. The OopsIE trojan
has the ability to execute remote commands and to upload and download files from the victim
system517. New ISMDoor variants appeared in early 2018; these variants included an information
stealer and a remote administration tool (RAT)517.



Unofficial Android marketplaces, such as Myket, use malware families to attack using update lures.
These have been mostly targeting users of messaging and social media platforms (such as Telegram,
Twitter, and Facebook). It is an Iranian espionage campaign discovered in 2018517.



TEMP.Periscope (or else “Leviathan”) cyber espionage group escalates its detected activity targeting
engineering and maritime entities, especially those connected to South China issues during March
2018. This advantage includes the utilisation of a large library of malware including AIRBREAK,
BADFLICK, PHOTO, HOMEFRY, LUNCHMONEY, MURKYTOP, China Chopper, and Beacon533.



Operation Parliament attackers’ acts involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial
bodies, military and intelligence agencies and large trading companies around the world, especially
the Middle East and North Africa. This targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of
2018534,535.

DustSquad is a Russian-language cyber espionage group. In April 2018, Official authorities demanded
the demolish of Octapus, a malicious Windows program that pretends to be a Telegram, against
diplomatic entities in Central Asia537.



APT27 (also known as, Emissary Panda and LuckyMouse) is a Chinese cyber espionage group. In June
2018, a national campaign is detected targeting governmental data centres and other resources538.



APT28 (also known as, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, STRONTIUM and Tsar Team) is
a cyber espionage group most probably sponsored by the Russian government. During 2018, the
Fancy Bear group targets the US Senate, the German Elections, the Emmanuel Macron campaign, the
Turkish and Montenegro Parliaments, as well as Foreign Affairs Agencies and Embassies in Europe and
Russia539,540. In August 2018, researchers exposed the fact that for many years, Fancy Bear had been
targeting the email correspondence of the officials of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople541. This espionage activity is also correlated with the Ukraine amid efforts to
disassociate Ukraine’s Orthodox church from its association with the Russian church542. Researchers
also attributed this year spread of VPNFilter malware and Lolajack attack to this group.543

November’s midterm elections545.

3.15.5 Specific attack vectors
In cyber-espionage attacks, threat agents often use complex pieces of malware and repurposed
ransomware. In most cases, common spreading and infecting methods, such as phishing, are used. For
more details about attack vectors, please see chapter 5.

3.15.6 Specific mitigation actions
Due to the comprehensive nature of this threat, several mitigation measures found in other threats of this
report could be employed. The following advice517,546,547,548 proposes baseline mitigation controls for this
threat:


Hire talented individuals to manage and support AI-based technologies at the upstream level.



Identify mission critical roles in the organisation and estimate their exposure to espionage risks.
Espionage risks are being evaluated based on business information (i.e. business intelligence).



Create security policies that accommodate human resource, business and operational security
controls to cater for risk mitigation. This will include rules and practices for awareness raising,
corporate governance and security operations.



Establish corporate practices to communicate, train and apply the developed rules and keep
operational parts up and running.



Develop an evaluation criterion (KPI) to benchmark the operation and adapt it to upcoming changes.



Implement whitelisting development for critical application services, depending on the risk level
assessed.



Conduct regular vulnerability assessment and patching of used software, especially for systems that
are in the perimeter.



Implement a need-to-know principle for access rights definition and establish controls to monitor
misuse of privileged profiles.



Implement a content filtering solution for all inbound and outbound channels (e.g. email, web,
network traffic).

3.15.7 Kill Chain
Kill chain is not relevant for this threat: this is a “composite” threat consists of many cyberthreats
spanning all the phases of the kill chain, just as data breaches.

Visualising changes in the current threat landscape
This chapter provides a visualization of the changes assessed in 2018’s landscape in comparison with the
previous year (see table 4). Besides the changes in ranking, the table also displays the trends identified for
each threat. The interesting phenomenon of having some threats with stable or decreasing trend
remaining in the same ranking (i.e. Insider Threat, Physical manipulation/damage/theft/loss, Cyber
Espionage), is mostly due to the fact that, albeit stagnation, the role of this threat in the total landscape
was maintained (through volume of infections, identified incidents, breaches attributed to the threat,
etc.).

4. Threat Agents
Threat agents and trends
Threat agent matters have been one of the most interesting areas of the 2018’s threat landscape. Albeit
until the middle of 2018 developments in this area advanced, they did so in analogy to the increasing
maturity of CTI practices. Around the end of the year, however, we have seen some quantum leap results
in attributions549,550. These developments were mostly caused by increasing efforts to tackle terrorism551,
but also by the increasing preparedness to politically and diplomatically thematise subliminal activities of
countries towards cyber-warfare and cyber-espionage. Numerous politically motivated initiatives came to
amplify the appetite of governments in looking into underground operations of opponents and use them
within international diplomacy campaigns to accomplish their objectives552,553.
As in other domains of CTI, the developments observed in the area of threat agents are due to a widening
of the scope of cyberthreat intelligence to other related areas such as threat intelligence and generic
intelligence. Definitely, the role of LEAs within cybersecurity operations but also the increasing role of
National Cyber Security Centres has contributed towards enhancing CTI’s scope. Moreover, it became
apparent that the impact of cyber-incidents affects the physical space. This has led inevitably to the
manifestation of the importance of attribution. Hence, the identification of threat agents has become a
central element in cyberthreat mitigation.
By looking at the trends/advancements in the areas of threat agents from the defenders point of view, it
is noticeable that:


In 2018 we have seen approaches aiming at a better understanding of the “attacker perspective”554.
Such approaches are based on the visualisation of the motives and identification of methods (TTPs)
and modus operandi encountered in series of attacks555. Given the existence of recurring threat agent
behaviours (methods, tools and tactics), this approach leads to good rates of recognition of kind and
origin of threat agents.



In 2018 there have been increasing efforts to penetrate the infrastructure of threat agents. By using
intelligence, some actors try to create trustful personas allowing them to enter into hacker fora556.
Moreover, various nation state organisations try to hack back to be in the position to monitor actions

of threat agents and/or disrupt their infrastructures557. Finally, through the combination of
cyberthreat intelligence and intelligence skills, some impressive successes regarding unveiling of state
sponsored agents have been achieved558,559.


Efforts to simulate threat agent tactics have been assessed in 2018. Via a series of tools, cybersecurity
companies try to enhance awareness and preparedness of their customers in defending a cyberattack560,561. Though not directly related to threat agents, this approach may contribute towards less
successful threat agent activities.



Cyberthreat Intelligence experts have underlined inefficiencies of defending strategies based on the
kill-chain562. In particular, defender activities are mostly triggered at a late stage of the kill-chain563,
that is, after the adversaries have performed the infiltration of the target. In other words, defence is
based on the late phases of the kill-chain (i.e. command and control, action on objectives), while
defence in the early phases are often neglected in the defence strategies (i.e. reconnaissance,
weaponization, delivery, exploitation and installation).

2018 has also brought quite a few new developments from the side of threat agents:


It is assumed that traditional state sponsored threat agents are currently repositioning themselves in
the changing geopolitical space564: though activities of some groups seem to decrease, new types of
campaigns assigned to new actors may stem from known actors who have changed tactics and
targets, but they are using similar tools, malicious sites and vulnerabilities.



In 2018, attack tactics have shifted to malware-less attacks with email and impersonation attacks
being the main infection vector565. In the enhanced threat agent capabilities belong time related
attack tactics (e.g. kind of phishing according to week days), selective phishing via refined social
engineering tactics, payload installed via remote access tools (e.g. Remote Desktop Protocol (RPD)
interfaces)566, targeted attacks tailored to sectors, etc.567.



Just as in 2018, the discovery of vulnerabilities continues increasing568. Until first half of 2018,
vulnerabilities have reached an all year high and it is expected that 2018 in total will top all other

years. This trend has also positive effects569: in 2018, patching of vulnerabilities from software
vendors has grown. Moreover, concepts such as vulnerability taxonomy are useful tools for end users
to perform vulnerability-based mitigation570.


Threat agents introduce new methods for evading attribution and detection of attacks. File-less and
memory-resident threats as well as use of common attack tools seem to be efficient ways in achieving
objectives, while at the same time effectively hide their traits571. This a generic trend that is
manifested in various attack patterns on the one hand and the decline of activities of known threat
groups.



Threat actors, especially advanced ones, are making progress in using the supply chain to achieve
their objectives572. In 2018, a hardware attack has made headlines573 and led to controversial
discussions574. Despite this single incident, numerous supply chain attacks are assumed to take place,
mainly launched by high capability agents575. Assessments hereto have led to the conclusion that
supply chain attacks are to be considered as a “key threat”.

Some of the above points are taken up in the conclusions of this report (see chapter 6).

Top threat agents and motives
In this chapter, we present an outline of top threat agent groups. It includes observations about their
motives and main trends assessed with regard to their capabilities. This is a complementary view to the
threat assessments (including tools, methods and tactics) presented within the top cyberthreats (see
chapter 3) and the attack vectors (see chapter 5).
Before going into the developments in each particular threat agent group, it is necessary to explain the
complex dynamics in this field. Increasing maturity in threat agent profiling demonstrates that the
characteristics of the threat agent groups are in a permanent flow576. Albeit ideological matters may be
the main motives to let a person enter to whatever hacker group, personal developments, political
environment, skills and monetary ambitions may be the drivers causing people to change their minds over
time. These forces may affect the motives of threat agents and make them change their group. Criminal
profiling may be the necessary tool to understand these shifts/changes. Though not applied in
understanding cyberthreat agent group dynamics, these techniques start penetrating the threat
landscape577. It is expected that this trend will persist in the coming years and will further facilitate
attribution.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018
ETL 2018 | 1.0 | External | January 2019

Just as in previous threat landscapes, we consider the following threat agents’ groups: cyber-criminals,
insiders, cyber-spies, hacktivists, cyber-offenders, cyber-fighters, cyber-terrorists and script-kiddies. It
should be noted that the sequence of mentioning these actors is according to their engagement in the
threat landscape578,579.
The assessed cyberthreat agent groups are as follows:
In 2018, Cyber-criminals remained the most active threat agent group in cyber-space. The activity of this
threat agent group increased from the previous year, being responsible for over 80% of the incidents578.
The economics of cybercrime estimate that ca. 0,8% of the gross domestic product is impacted by this
threat agent group580. Overall, the activities of cybercriminals have demonstrated an increase in
complexity and sophistication. On the top of used TTPs resides the propagation of malware through
emails581. Over 60% of email traffic contained malicious content. Email was involved in more than 90% of
the cyber-attacks. Business email compromise (BEC) is responsible for a loss of over US $12 billion since
2013581. A further new development regarding monetization in 2018 is the use of
cyptojacking/cryptomining malware579 and cryptocurrencies attacks582. In 2018, ca. US $880 million losses
have been attributed to cryptocurrencies attacks583. Although the losses are not attributed to
cybercriminals only, there is a clear trend in 2018 of cybercriminals targeting cryptocurrencies. While
cryptojacking/cryptomining has risen in 2018 to replace ransomware from the top of malware584, the
monetisation achieved is not very high585. Another clear trend in cybercrime attacks in 2018 has been the
refinement of phishing by using social engineering techniques586. Remarkable are the trends towards
attacking Software-as-a-Serice (SaaS), the rates of phishing using social engineering (tripled in 2018) and
the continuous innovation towards persuading users for the originality of phishing scams587. As regards to
geographical issues, cybercriminals still target mostly USA users with phishing attacks586 with ca. 86% of
registered incidents. Despite the increase in attack complexity, simple/classic scams are still a popular
method, since even low success rates allow penetration in targeted infrastructures. As a final element of
the dynamics of this threat agent group, one should mention the innovation trend of Cybercrime-as-aService platforms579. Besides improvements of offered services, these developments lead to a higher
usability and popularity of these services. This may lead to more efficient attacks by all other threat agent
groups.

ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018

The insider threat (see also description as cyberthreat) is attributed to the threat agent group insider. This
group consists of malicious and negligent insiders. Insiders may be users, privileged users and service
providers/contractors. According to reports analysed in 2018, this group is the second source of
compromise in the threat landscape after cybercriminals567,588,589. Breach statistics show that around 25%
of incidents are attributed to insiders588 in corporate environments. Yet, businesses perceive the insider
threat as being the most prevalent one, with 64% of them investing in deterrence measures against
insiders590. The difference in perception between the actual impact of actual insider misuse is causing
non-proportional security expenses to organisations w.r.t. the effect of the implemented controls.
Assessments found in 2018 regarding insiders reveal that privilege misuse is the second source of
incidents and miscellaneous errors are at the 6th 591. For the breaches resulting from these incidents,
however, the sequence is inverted, that is, errors are leading to a higher number of breaches than
privilege misuse. This might be due to the higher exploitation of errors by adversaries of all types. While
monetization is the main motive of this threat agent group, most of the damage seems to be caused by
unintentional actions of employees592. These being accidental disclosure of data (e.g. use of wrong email
addresses), failures in recognising phishing attacks or misconfiguration errors593. Finally, it is worth
mentioning that insider threat may directly or indirectly materialize in supply chain attacks594,595.
In 2018, the activity of Nation States in cyberspace has been encountered multiple times in the
international headlines. Undoubtedly, this was due to geopolitical developments/tensions among various
countries, such as China, USA, North Korea, Russia, Germany and UK, just to mention the most important
ones596. Hence, 2018 is the year where it becomes evident that cyberespionage has to be analysed by
taking into account diplomatic, military and geopolitical developments. Moreover, by further advancing
their capabilities, nation states will continue bridging their cyber activities with all other affairs of national
relevance both within and outside the country. In 2018, we have seen these bridges being established by
coupling intelligence capabilities with threat and cyberthreat intelligence559. As regards the activity of this
threat agent group, 2018 has brought some noticeable changes. Firstly, it has been assessed that in 2018
the activity of some known threat agent groups has declined578. Yet, a comprehensive analysis of nationsponsored threat agents indicated that this inactivity may be explained as a step back towards
reorganizing their infrastructures and tactics597. Given the high level of investments in this area and the
need to stay under the radar, this assumption seems to be plausible. Another interesting development in
2018 was the attempt to increase impact of attacks. This has been manifested via high capability
campaigns aiming at destroying critical infrastructures598. An increase of attacks in the Industrial Control

Systems (ICS) may be interpreted as indicative of this trend599,600. Another trend of 2018 are attacks of
state sponsored agencies to banks, until now typical cybercrime targets583. It is assumed, that with such
attacks nation states try to avoid the negative impact of sanctions restricting their access to international
currencies601. Concluding the developments of this threat agent group, one has to mention a trend that
has been identified in 2018 regarding outsourcing of surveillance to foreign partners602. This trend may
weaken governmental oversight over surveillance activities, thus causing additional, difficult to mitigate
privacy risks. As a final note, one should consider corporations using almost the same techniques as
nation state agents. This is due to the vicinity of commercial organisations with strategic role in a country
to state sponsored resources in order to obtain competitive knowledge from competitors603.
Hacktivists continue their activity in 2018 at a similar pace as in the previous year578. They continue
defacement campaigns based on target web sites and are using DDoS attacks to victims web services to
draw the attention of media. Driven by protest actions against political/geopolitical decisions affecting
national and international matters, hacktivists had in 2018 sufficient reasons to unfold their activities.
Women rights and gun violence have been some remarkable events that triggered protests604. Hacktivists
still perform cyber-activism as independent, loosely associated cells605. A comprehensive resource on
hacktivists activities provides sufficient information on defacement techniques used604,606. According to
this report, the main defacement technique used is web site hacking. Through an extensive analysis of
hacktivist activities over the last 18 years, the main techniques identified are SQL injection, unpatched
system vulnerabilities and password stealing. Linux and Apache have been the main web platforms
compromised607. However, monetization is not the main motive behind hacktivist attacks, their access to
compromised web sites (ca. 10 Million) may be misused for this kind of motive. Similar incidents have
been identified in the past608. This potential may create links to other threat agent groups aiming at profitdriven activities. Besides defacement, hacktivists are still active in disclosing confidential information
found in hacked web sites. Moreover, they are extensively using DDoS at tacks, especially due to the wide
availability of this attack vector in underground markets. Hacktivism was the second motive as regards
the use of DDoS related attack vectors609.
In 2018 we have not found sufficient reports on the motive Cyber Fighters per se, that is, on religiously
motivated groups. It seems that this motivation is currently being assumed to belong to Cyber Terrorists

and in some particular cases to state-sponsored actors610. This evidence has led us to merge Cyber
Fighters and Cyber Terrorists to a single group under the name of Cyber Terrorists. This decision is also
seconded by the fact that the term Cyber Fighters is now associated with cyber defence groups that are
mandated with the development of tactics related to cyber warfare defence611. Having said that, in 2018
cyber and terrorism continue their convergence: terrorists continue using legitimate services to perform
propaganda w.r.t. their efforts to recruit new members and perform fund rising to finance their
operations. Together with the motive of performing cyber-attacks, monetisation and recruitment are the
main aims of this threat agent group579. It seems that defending cyber terrorism will require a tighter
cooperation among law enforcement agencies, as well as public and private companies. The main concern
will be a better the scrutiny of social media (for recruitment and fund raining) for the identification of
rogue actors612. Another important element is the observation of money flows, especially the ones
regarding cryptocurrencies579. As regards cyber terrorist capabilities in performing cyber-attacks, it is
believed that despite the existence of malicious tools in dark market, this threat agent group still
maintains low capabilities. Apparently, their ability to access cyber-attack knowledge remains at a low
level613. Despite the assessed low level of capabilities, several states have put counterterrorism protection
on the agenda of state defence614,615,616. Given the availability of Crime-as-a-Service and the potential to
recruit hackers for their objectives, it is indicative that assessments show cyber terrorism picking up
significantly in the years to come617. If seen in relation to weaknesses in industrial control systems (ICS)
systems, this predictions sound rather plausible599,618.
The threat agent group script kiddies has been maintained in 2018’s assessments for a variety of reasons.
Firstly, some incidents emanating from this threat agent group have been encountered in 2018619,620.
Though these incidents are just a minor part of the threat landscape, they clearly demonstrate the
potential impact this threat agent group could may create. Secondly, the large amount of available tools

and source code leakage bear the risk of misuse by minors621,622,623,624. Such tools may become a powerful
instrument in the hands of low capability groups. Moreover, when trying to quantify the available
knowledge and striking power of script kiddies, one may have a look at various cyber security
challenges625: young individuals having some guidance may become very efficient in hacking. If taken as a
mirror of capability levels that can be acquired by “entry level” hackers, these events are a clear indication
at what levels a teenager may arrive when utilising existing tools. Though cyber-security challenges are
definitely the right instruments to engage talented individuals, one should assume that not all hacking
minors will be engaged in such events. These assumptions are funded by similar assessments in the cybersecurity community626 and should be taken seriously by the cyber-security community.

Threat Agents and top threats
The involvement of the above threat agents in the deployment of the identified top cyberthreats is
presented in the table below (see table 5). The purpose of this table is to visualize which threat agent
groups are involved in which threats. This information is targeted towards stakeholders who are
interested in assessing possible threat agent involvement in the deployment of threats. This information
might be useful in identifying the capability level can be assumed behind the top threats and thus support
in decisions concerning the strength of the security controls that are implemented to protect valuable
assets. The table below is very similar to the one of ETL 2017627, apart from some minor
changes/adaptations based on the engagement of threat agents in 2018’s incidents.
The table visualizes the various capability levels of various threat agent groups: threat agents who are the
source of many primary threat actions are the ones with higher capabilities, while with ones with more
secondary or no cyberthreat assignment are possess lower capabilities.

5. Attack Vectors
The deployment of the different cyberthreats assessed in the previous chapters is done by the use of one
or more attack vectors.
“Specifically, an attack vector is a path or means by which a threat agent can gain access to a computer or
network server, abuse weaknesses or vulnerability on assets (including human) in order to achieve a
specific outcome”628.
The description of an attack vector is essential in order to understand the various tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTP) used by threat agents described earlier. It gives a structured way for threat analysts to
describe a threat agent’s behaviour and defenders to implement appropriate defences, following a
“Course of Action”.
In this ETL report, the primary attack vectors identified in various security incidents have been categorised
in a taxonomy presented in topic 5.1. Attack vectors analysed in previous ENISA Threat Landscapes are
still valid. To this extent, the current chapter provides additional vectors that have been encountered in
the reporting period.
Out of the sum of encountered attack vectors, three attack vectors are analysed in this report, namely
“Misinformation/Disinformation”, “Web and browser-based attack vectors” and “Fileless or memorybased attacks”. The last section of this chapter reviews current trends with attack vectors encountered in
modular and multi-staged threats.

Attack vectors taxonomy for this year’s threat landscape
The list below provides a categorization of the most predominant and noteworthy attack vectors
observed by ENISA throughout the year. A full knowledge base of cyber adversary behaviour and
taxonomy for adversarial actions maintained by MITRE is available at ATT&CK website629.

Misinformation/Disinformation
The alleged inference by foreign nation states in the US and French Presidential elections, in an organized
fashion, constitute the hybrid threats of the 21st century630. The range of methods used includes
propaganda, deception, misinformation/disinformation and other non-conventional tactics that have long
been used to destabilise adversaries in the physical space. What is new about the attacks seen in recent
years is their transposition to cyberspace, hence their speed, scale and intensity, facilitated by rapid
technological change and global interconnectivity.
This type of attacks has highly targeted business and individuals. Every day, unscrupulous characters
publish hundreds of made-up stories online to gain a financial advantage, sway opinion or cause damage.
More than 2,000 identified online news sources publish false, outlandish, extremist, extremely slanted or

satiric information each day. Most fake news stories that appear on social media originate from those
fake news sites631.
The analysis of attack vectors used in misinformation/disinformation campaigns highlights the growing
importance that this cyber capability plays in the threat landscape.
Online trolling – The definition of online trolling is the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive or
disruptive manner using internet platforms (social media, messaging and blogs) with no apparent
instrumental purpose.
The online spread of fake news – Online fake news consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes
spreading via online platforms. Attackers can amplify their content and messages using social media,
clickbait, and advertising. Furthermore, access to data and analytics on content performance and visitor
demographics enable the accessibility of targets and hone the viral nature of the launched messages.
The abuse of social media and search engines algorithms - Algorithms are processes in (computational)
calculations and/or operations. Social media and search engines use various algorithms to predict what
users are interested in seeing and generate user engagement. Based on a user's habits and history of
clicks, shares and likes, algorithms filter and prioritise the content that the user receives. When used
maliciously, algorithms have the power to amplify the impact of misinformation/disinformation
campaigns, in a more precise and effective way.
Illegitimate social bots - A social bot is an automated account programmed to interact like a user in
particular on social media. For disinformation purposes, illegitimate social bots can be used to push
certain narratives, amplify misleading messaging and distort the online discourse.
Example security incidents related to this attack vector:


In May 2018, a social media user shared a warning about a popular brand for makeup-remover
disposable cloths, claiming that the product caused a violent allergic reaction. Within a few days, the
post632 was shared tens of thousands of times, making it impossible for the company to contest the
claim and stop the spread.



The smartphone messaging application WhatsApp was used as a tool to target millions of Brazilian
voters ahead of the October 2018 presidential election, deluging political messages. The missives,
spread through the country by the millions, targeted voters before the election. A study633 of 100,000
WhatsApp images found more than half, containing misleading or flatly false information.



When data from 87 million Facebook users634 (including that of 2.7 million EU citizens) were
improperly shared with the political consultancy company Cambridge Analytica, data about sexual
orientation, race, and intelligence were gathered by algorithms and used to micro-target and mobilise
voters in the US presidential election and the UK referendum on EU membership635.

Cyber espionage

Web and browser based attack vectors
The high number of incidents with malicious cryptomining in 2018 requires revisiting and complementing
what was described in last year ETL report about “compromising the web and browsers” attack vector.
With the first introduction of JavaScript cryptocurrency miners running directly from browsers, it was
quickly exploited by cyber-criminals. Since then, malicious cryptomining has been considered as a top
threat, added into the top 15 in this year’s ETL report. Cryptomining refers to a process in which, each
time a cryptocurrency transaction is made, a miner is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of
information and updating the blockchain digital ledger, in return of a financial reward. Basically, cybercriminals use their victims’ resources such as computing power, connectivity, and electrical power by
exploiting their web browser to perform mining operations. More information about cryptojacking can be
found in chapter 3.13.
A simple cryptokacking attack is illustrated below:

Figure 44: A cryptojacking attack

Example security incidents related to this attack vector:


Researchers discovered636 a new Linux crypto-miner botnet dubbed PyCryptoMiner spreading over
SSH. The Monero miner botnet is based on Python and leverages Pastebin as command and control
server when the original C&C isn’t available. If all C&C servers of the botnet are not accessible, all
newly infected bots are idle, polling for the botmaster’s Pastebin page.



The Blackberry Mobile site was hacked exploiting a vulnerability of Magento. The attackers install a
Monero miner using the Coinhive library637.

A report638 published by the SANS Technology Institute reveals that attackers are exploiting a critical
Oracle WebLogic flaw (CVE 2017-10271) to inject Monero cryptocurrency miners on victim’s
machines.



A security researcher revealed the details of a RIG exploit campaign distributing malware coin miners



Researchers discovered641 a newly malicious URL redirection campaign that infects users with the
XMRig Monero cryptocurrency miner. The campaign has already victimized users between 15 and 30
million times.

Related cyberthreats:
Malware, ransomware, web application attacks, phishing, data breaches and drive-by-download attacks.

Fileless or memory-based attacks
Also known as “living-off-the-land”642, fileless or memory-based attack is one in which an attacker uses
existing software, allowed applications and authorized protocols to carry out malicious activities. Fileless
attacks are capable of gaining control of computers without downloading any malicious files.
Characteristics of a fileless attack:


Has no identifiable code or signature that allows typical antivirus tools to detect it. It also does not
have a particular behaviour; therefore, heuristics scanners cannot detect it.



Lives in the computer's RAM.



Uses processes that are native to the operating system in order to carry out the attack.



Can be paired with other malware.



Able to circumvent application whitelisting. Fileless malware takes advantage of approved
applications that are already in the system.



May include a “dropper” or a script used in early attack stages for malware installation and for a wide
variety of post-exploitation activities.

A simple fileless attack is illustrated below:

Figure 45: A fileless attack

Example security incidents related to this attack vector:


In January 2018, security researchers uncovered643 a campaign, dubbed Operation PowerShell
Olympics, targeting organizations involved in the South Korea winter games, with the aim to control
the infected machines. The researchers noted that the attacks used an open source stenography tool,
to embed the PowerShell script into the image file, allowing the attackers to implant additional
malware from a remote server.



A security researcher identified644 fileless attacks targeting servers and workstations, using
PowerGhost and CactusTorch malware. PowerGhost, an obfuscated PowerShell script, plants itself in
the targeted system’s random access memory. Uses the WMI tool and the Mimikatz data extraction
tool to escalate privileges and set up its mining operation. The CactusTorch fileless malware executes
and loads malicious .NET files straight via the memory.

Related cyberthreats:
Malware, ransomware, malicious scripts and data breach.

Multi-staged and modular threats
Recent trends in multi-staged and modular malware attacks reveal how this type of attack is becoming
increasingly sophisticated, versatile and persistent. VPNFilter, BlackEnergy, and CobInt are good examples
of this type of attack. It uses different vectors, depending on a pre-assessment conducted to the victim’s
infrastructure, to initiate the attack. The VPNFilter, for example, is able to support the collection of
intelligence about the victim and from the analysis, download additional malware to shape the attack
dynamically.

In July 2018, security researchers described VPNFilter as a sophisticated malware affecting 500,000
networking devices.645. The malware - initially affecting Ukrainian hosts - spread over 54 countries at an
alarming rate. Researchers attributed this malware to a Russian state-sponsored hacking group Sofacy
(also known as Fancy Bear and APT28).
The versatile and persistent behaviour of this malware on networking devices generated great concern
among security professionals and authorities around the world. In its multi-stage and modular
capabilities, it is able to support the collection of intelligence, misattribution and destructive cyberattack
operations. Moreover, it has a range of capabilities including data exfiltration, spying on traffic and
ultimately rendering the infected device unbootable. According to the researcher, the malware code
overlaps with versions of the BlackEnergy malware, which was responsible for multiple large-scale attacks
that targeted devices in Ukraine.



Installation – The attacker injects malware into devices running firmware version based on Busybox
and Linux. The main purpose is to gain a persistent foothold and enable the download and
deployment of additional malware in a persistent way.



Command & Control - Utilizes multiple redundant C2 mechanisms to discover the IP address of
deployment servers, making this malware extremely robust and capable of dealing with unpredictable
C2 infrastructure changes.



Actions on Objectives – The attack is executed using a variety of capabilities such as file collection,
command execution, data exfiltration, device management and firmware overwrite among others.
Additionally, the malware introduces multiple modules serving as plugins providing additional
functionality. The researcher identified two plugin modules: a packet sniffer for collecting traffic that
passes through the device including theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA
protocols and a communications module over the TOR network.

Typical attack vectors used:
1) Network propagation/lateral movement.
2) Exploitation of vulnerabilities.

6. Conclusions
Main CTI-related cyber-issues ahead
This chapter summarizes the CTI-related issues that have been identified during the 2018’s threat
assessments. They are either related directly to the assessed threats or they are consequences of those
assessments. Moreover, some of those issues arise from experiences from the state-of-the-art in CTI, as
they have been communicated/discussed within various interactions with CTI-practitioners. As opposed
to some potentially interesting/valuable sources of threat predictions646,647,648,649, this chapter does not
provide any predictions per se. Instead, it consolidates identified needs that have to be performed in
order to enhance efficiency of CTI. These activities are a consequence of the current threat landscape and
the current CTI practices. Although some causality may be evident in the sequence of the points below,
they are not listed according to any priority scheme, nor having any a weighting factor in mind. The issues
mentioned below imply the conclusions provided in the forthcoming chapter (see chapter 6.2). They have
been categorised according to their relevance with policy, business and technical matters.
In the reporting period, it has been assessed that state-sponsored agents are allegedly changing attack
practices. They shifted their modus operandi towards lower levels of infrastructure components. This is
being implemented through both hardware abuse and compromise of general-purpose components that
are often outside the protection zones of organizations, such as ISPs, information brokers, cloud
providers, network management services, etc. Just this year, several governments650,651 introduced a ban
and campaigned against the involvement of tech-giants such as Huawei and ZTE in building their 5G
infrastructure, under the pretext of posing serious risks to their national security. Another element of
their novel attack tactics includes targeted attacks at the user level: through social engineering, effective
spear phishing attacks are being crafted. These changes in attack methods render sophisticated and
expensive network intrusion methods obsolete and can be implemented with commonly available
techniques and procedures. At the same time, their operations are difficult to spot, as they fall into the
vast mass of attacks originated from other threat agents such as cybercriminals and hacktivists. These
developments make evident that detection and mitigation methods for these types of attacks need to be
accordingly adapted.
Non-targeted threats spreading contagiously in the cyberspace tend to last longer (or not to disappear at
all). This is mainly due to the reduced adoption by individuals and organizations of cyber hygiene practices
(cryptographic keys and user credentials protection, etc.), adherence to good security practices (revised
security policies, two face authentication (2FA), etc.) and systems still operating without any security
updates, to name a few. The same is valid to justify the lengthy time taken by many organizations to
acknowledge and respond to an incident. This situation urges organizations to include cybersecurity into
their risk management functions and identify clear strategies to anticipate and/or respond to crises.

Due to increased automation of many attack vectors, end-users are under permanent exposure to a vast
number of attacks652. Given the weak protection in many end-user systems, it is likely that targeted
individuals may experience a successful attack. The existing gap in cybersecurity knowledge and CTI in
particular, makes affected end-users feel left alone with the mitigation of impact from successful attacks.
It is imperative to close this gap by disseminating related knowledge to all intermediate elements in the
delivery of services. CTI is definitely an important missing element in the protection of the entire chain of
service delivery. New models of CTI knowledge delivery and automated means of cyberthreat mitigation
are necessary in order to bridge this gap. Otherwise, the trust of end-users is at risk, especially when
monetary impact is caused by successful attacks. An increasing number of such incidents have been
encountered in the reporting period653,654.
The above is also true for SMEs: the complexity of cyberthreats is raising with the combination of multiple
payloads and stages, scalable architecture and a combination of a variety of delivery vectors in one single
attack. Cyber criminals are also combining technical and non-technical attack vectors to make their
campaigns more effective. The diversity of profiles, skills and competencies required to formulate and
implement a complete end-to-end cyber security strategy goes beyond the capabilities of the great
majority of small and medium organizations. Novel and affordable solutions will be required to automate
many of the time-consuming manual tasks. Such solutions may be implemented via threat intelligence
driven Managed Security Services or via seamless integration of threat intelligence services into enddevice security solutions (i.e. CTI-as-a-Service).
Cybersecurity awareness and knowledge flows are often failing in the transitions between domains of
responsibility. Variations in terminology, understanding of requirements and variating speed of relevant
management cycles are the most common grounds for these failures. Numerous techniques have been
identified to avoid such failures. These include the better interconnection among the various
cybersecurity stakeholders, the better identification of “crown jewels”, the use of horizon scanning
activities and the use of scenarios as basis for cybersecurity assessments. Other factors enabling better
knowledge flows are sectorial cybersecurity assessments, more targeted reporting and better sharing
practices of relevant information. Nonetheless, in cases of distributed governance655 it is necessary to
implement measures that allow for the formulation of coordinated incentives, common understanding of
strategic objectives and strategic requirements. It is clear that in those cases, the effort of connecting to
stakeholders and anticipating the multiple perspectives involved in decision-making processes is key to
success.
Cybercrime is reportedly originated from geographies with less restrictive laws/regulations to combat and
prevent illegal activities outside their countries. The future protection of the digital economy, of a free
and open Internet and transnational cybercrime reduction will require more effort for coordinated cyberdiplomacy, LEA and defence cooperation, enforcing the international law in cyberspace and create
homogeneous regulatory geographies. Current activities in this direction are indicative of the importance
of this issue. Yet, the abstention of some key cyberspace actors from those initiatives is a source of

concerns towards the achievement of this goal656. Moreover, because cybersecurity is considered to be a
utility, governments need to guarantee its continuous availability for all citizens. To this extent, CTI
capability constitutes a common good that will need to be delivered to all interested parties, at least at a
baseline level. Last but not least, differences in legal frameworks are a burden in collecting cyberthreat
intelligence. In some countries, assessing the weaknesses of publicly available services is considered to be
a criminal act. In order to facilitate the collection and maintenance of CTI, it will be necessary to remove
such regulatory barriers.
While building CTI capabilities is a mainstream activity worldwide, European bodies/organisations and
member States are still at a low level of CTI maturity. This fact is manifested by weak or missing
references to CTI within policy documents and by the limited level of investments in relevant
infrastructures and services. With most CTI sources being developed outside Europe (e.g. US), European
organisations are significantly dependent on capabilities maintained mainly outside the continent. This is
a threat to its sovereignty and its ability of self-determination with regard to the assessment of the
cyberthreat landscape and the establishment of appropriate protection measures. And although some
approaches to European CTI capabilities do exist16,657,658,659,660, Europe lacks an overall strategy for the
development of such capabilities and the enhancement of relevant skills. The establishment and further
development of such capabilities is therefore seen as a high priority topic at the European level. Europe
needs independent CTI capabilities based on self-collected data from the EU space. Moreover, response
to CTI events has shown that there is a high demand for bonding activities among European and
international CTI providers; and the exchange of information/experience on CTI good practices is very
high in the wish list of various types of organisations.
Attacks to the supply chain have dominated the headlines for some time in 2018573. Supply chain attacks
are happening in the transition phases of the development of complex systems and are targeting the
weakest link in the chain. Though not new, these attacks have attracted the interest of cybersecurity
experts due to their detection difficulty and efficiency661. The mounting pressure to have shorter time-tomarket, to meet the demand and be cost effective, may lead to compromises during the initial stage of
product research and development. But production phases are also at stake, especially due to
globalisation of industrial production to geographic areas that are outside the political and diplomatic
influence of western high developed industrial nations. The uncertainty about the successful
implementation of cybersecurity and quality standards will persist, especially due to the emergence of IoT
that connects cyber and physical spaces. The threat landscape emerging from supply chain attacks is a
major cybersecurity concern, especially for low-cost devices.
Just as other cybersecurity disciplines, CTI has not yet been properly “synchronised” to other important
management cycles in organisations, such risk management, corporate governance and data protection.
Although asynchronous cycles are the root of problems in the communication of surfaced risks, it is also

natural in all technology driven activities: often, technological projects develop own lives within
organisations and may easily evade the attention of decision makers662. This shortcoming has been
recognised among CTI experts. The mobilization of multidisciplinary stakeholders seems to be the right
way for its resolution. Yet, a discussion forum where these stakeholders can voice their concerns needs to
be created. Again, this is an opportunity for Europe to create such a forum and deliver a competitive
advantage for the European internal market.
Cyberthreat intelligence has evolved in the last 7-8 years from the need to follow up on a rapidly changing
cyberthreat landscape. This rapid development was purely technology driven and narrowly scoped. Its
relevance highly matured traditional intelligence has been recently recognized. The advantages that can
be materialised when coupling traditional intelligence and cyberthreat intelligence have not yet been
implemented. Individual events in the reporting period549 have demonstrated the increases in efficiency
when combining these two disciplines. Though the deployment of cyberdefence practices may facilitate
mutual fertilization between these two disciplines, public and private organisation will need to benefit
from these synergies too. This is yet another opportunity for Europe - but also for international players -to
implement a synergy that will boost cybersecurity to new quality and maturity level.

Conclusions and recommendations for this year’s ETL report.
In this section, the conclusions of this year’s ETL are being presented. They are divided into three
categories, namely policy, business and research/education. This differentiation is indicative for the type
of actors that would need to take up actions to cope with the points made below. Though there is a large
variety of organisations matching each of these categories, they are not further specified in this report.
This would go beyond the scope/purpose of this document. We believe, however, that it is quite
straightforward for interested readers to understand what type of organisation would be relevant for the
points made in each category, especially when national, sectorial and educational peculiarities are being
taken into account. This year’s conclusion are not overlap-free to the ones of previous years. However,
new developments have helped us to make them more specific/targeted.

Policy conclusions


Governments, EU Member States and EU Institutions need to facilitate training of CTI staff. Moreover,
due to the increased market needs for this skill and the competitive packages offered by industry,
administrations will need to develop employment conditions that can attract talents and lead to staff
retention.



EU and EU Member States will need to invest in CTI capability building by means of skills development
and infrastructure (technical, human). Such activity will contribute towards the necessary
improvement of European CTI capabilities and will increase independence. This will enhance the level
of CTI knowledge quality and turn it to a more effective resource towards successfully managing
critical events within Europe, especially the ones targeting critical infrastructures.



The quality of CTI knowledge heavily depends on the ingested information. Several barriers do exist in
Europe and worldwide that hinder access to such information: the existence of diversified regulatory
spaces, the unavailability of reliable incident information and deficiencies in information sharing. A
Policy should enable better ingestion of information to produce CTI by removing legal and regulatory
barriers.



To a certain extent, CTI is considered a public good. Administrations will need to subsidize the
creation of CTI knowledge centres and support the development of good practices and tools for
various types of organisations. This will be a direct contribution to enhance the protection of critical
assets.



Currently, many players join cyber-activities in the cyberspace. Administrations will need to take
proactive measures to avoid distortions that may be caused by overlapping activities and
responsibilities663. Such actions should contribute towards CTI information sharing and avoidance of
duplication of work among states.



Administrations will need to make efforts to close the gap between end-users and high-end CTI
operators. This will require the availability of CTI knowledge and services in a form that is digestible by
non-expert users.



High-level horizon scanning activities that are based on emerging cybersecurity challenges and
emerging threats need to be introduced and taken into account when policy decisions are being
made. Such activities should be based on scenario development and may provide valuable insights for
impact assessments made in the framework of regulatory activities.

Business conclusions


Businesses will need to develop viable CTI services to cover a wide range of enterprises that possess
low to no CTI skills. Such services may be oriented towards various maturity levels and provide
seamless automation for the protection of assets based on CTI information.



Businesses will need to define processes for CTI knowledge management. Such processes need to be
in sync with other cybersecurity processes and in particular with risk management. They aim at
enhancing the agility of processes is to follow the agility of CTI knowledge management.



Businesses need to respond to the trend of cyber-attack automation. The developed solution should
consist of tools that automate the adaptation of controls based on CTI-feeds. Such solutions will be
tailored to the needs of enterprises with low security budgets.



Businesses should estimate the risks emerging from potential cyber-attacks to their customer base by
extrapolating their impact. By taking into account potential losses that can be experienced by users,
they will reduce attack surfaces and help end-users protecting their assets. Such an approach will
enhance user trust and remove barriers to technology deployment. This is particularly important in
areas such as IoT, eHealth and mobile computing.



Businesses should be aware of supply chain threats. Such threats are prevalent in complex product
development processes involving multiple providers. While the development of qualitative criteria for
the various development phases may help, it is important to assess the end-to-end characteristics of
used components. Light certification processes of the components used may be a further option for
the reduction of exposure to such threats.

Technical, Research, Educational conclusions


Developing threat assessments on a sectorial basis will be necessary. Such assessments will be
oriented towards specific technology areas and will help users of these sectors managing threats on
those environments.



Cyber-crime evolves towards professionalization in various verticals. Moreover, cyber-criminals
combine their skills to increase automation and efficiency of attack vectors. Defenders will need to
better understand these developments and provide new methods for detection. Novel disruption
methods need to be developed. Such methods will need to take into account defences for all phases
in the kill-chain, as opposed to current practices that are triggered mostly after exploitation has been
detected.



There is a pressing need for common vocabulary in the area of CTI. Currently available threat
taxonomies664 and common frameworks91, however, they are often side-products of threat
assessment projects and are not systematically maintained/updated and/or consolidated.



Efficiency of cyber-attacks depends on the existence of vulnerabilities in targeted systems.
Vulnerability management practices need to be part of defence strategies. This is manifested through
a large number of vulnerabilities in end-user systems and services and the long time-windows for
patching known vulnerabilities. The cyber-security community will need to develop better means for
the detection and removal of vulnerabilities by also covering geographical viewpoints (e.g. the
European space).



There are many improvements necessary at the ingestion level of CTI knowledge. Better sharing
schemes and better analysis of known incidents are major avenues to achieve this goal. It is necessary
to combine incident reporting and CTI processing. This will enhance the quality and accuracy of CTI.



CTI needs to be combined with related disciplines to enlarge scope and include additional sources. In
2018, the combination of CTI and traditional intelligence has shown a great potential towards threat
mitigation. Yet, mutual fertilisation from the combination of these two areas is at an initial
development stage. The development of methods combining these areas needs to be enforced.
