Mini Analysis of the TinyBanker Tinba

Today we’ll have a look at Tinba (Tiny Banker), the smallest banker in the world. Without
the use of a packer or crypter Tinba is around 20 KB, default configuration and web injects
included. A few days ago the source code of Tinba 1 was released on a closed
underground forum. Reference.
Tinba uses MiTB (Man in The Browser) tricks and web injects to change the appearance
of certain webpages. Objective: circumvent two factor Authentication and/or trick the victim
in giving up additional sensitive data.
Tinba uses RC4 encryption to communicate with its C&C servers. The key and the servers
are hardcoded into the binary. Before downloading updates from the C&C server, Tinba
sends out an RC4 encrypted string.
I accidentally found this sample of Tinba because the author used the same crypter as
ZeuS GameOver Reloaded. The sample was submitted to VirusTotal the same day as the
new ZeuS GameOver and seems to be the payload of a spam email targeting mainly
users from Poland and the Czech Republic. We can find back traces of the crypter in the
memory space of Tinba:
0x987041 (17): OU___Enemy %d ,
0x987053 (13): OU___Bomb %d

Along with the following strings:
0x14562a8 (11): LoadBitmapA
0x14562d0 (13): IntersectRect
0x1456342 (18): CreateCompatibleDC
0x1456358 (22): CreateCompatibleBitmap
0x145637c (14): ImageList_Draw
0x145638e (19): ImageList_AddMasked

1/10

The executable is 88.0 KB (90,112 bytes) and contains an RCData resource with the ID
56. The size (9479176 bytes) is fake; it’s bigger than the size of the executable. This will
cause a warning in Olly and makes it harder to extract the resource.

2/10

The resource with the ID 56 contains a fake JPG header. JPEGsnoop, a free windows
application able to examine and decode the inner details of JPEG images, reports an
unknown marker at the offset 0x000004B1 and notifies of existing data after EOF. Hiding
an executable in a resource is a method to evade anti-virus detections.

Upon execution TINBA.EXE [PID 2724] launches an instance of itself [PID 3004]. Note the
size of the executable: 20KB.

After approximately 1 minute (I noticed the SLEEP command in the code but didn’t time it)
TINBA.EXE will launch an instance of TASKMGR.EXE (Windows Task Manager), inject
code into the newly created process and exit.

Before terminating its process, TINBA.EXE contained the following Section:

3/10

\BaseNamedObjects\redhot
The same Section is found back in the TASKMGR.EXE process.

TASKMGR.EXE:
Reads the Volume Name and Serial Number
Creates a directory named "AdobeChk" in the %APPDATA% folder
Renames TINBA.exe to %APPDATA%\AdobeChk\chk.exe
c:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\AdobeChk\chk.exe
Date: 7/14/2014 4:36 PM
Size: 90,112 bytes
Creates the following Registry entry so that CHK.EXE runs each time Windows
starts:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
"AdobeChk"
Type: REG_SZ
Data: C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\AdobeChk\chk.exe
Sets tabs and frames to run within the same process in IE:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main
"TabProcGrowth"
Type: REG_DWORD
Data: 01, 00, 00, 00

4/10

TASKMGR.EXE will establish a little routine in case the file or the Registry keys are
deleted but the procedure looks a bit flawed to me. The injected process attempts to
create a folder that already exists (resulting in a name collision) and checks for a file called
"empty" in the folder where TINBA.EXE was located.

Tinba sends out an RC4 encrypted string to the C&C located at plsecdirect.ru and
receives a 403 Forbidden. The decrypted string is EHLO.
