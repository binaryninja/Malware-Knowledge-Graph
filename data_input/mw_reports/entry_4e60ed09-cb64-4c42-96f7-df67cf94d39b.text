Or as the FBI put it: “simply defined, intelligence is information that
has been analyzed and refined so that it is useful to policymakers in
making decisions – specifically, decisions about potential threats to
our national security.”

Cyber Threat Intelligence
Purpose of Intelligence

 To reduce the degree of uncertainty about an adversary, or
potential adversary, situation or threat which may be experienced by
decision makers.

 To convey the truth to decision makers and provide managers
with accurate information so they can make informed,
reasoned, and timely decisions.
