German Task Force for COVID-19 Medical Equipment Targeted in Ongoing Phishing
Campaign

Incident Response June 8, 2020
By Claire Zaboeva 3 min read
During the course of ongoing research on coronavirus-related cyber activity, IBM X-Force
Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) uncovered a COVID-19 related phishing
campaign targeting a German multinational corporation (MNC), associated with a German
government-private sector task force to procure personal protective equipment (Task Force
Schutzausrüstung). The group has been commissioned to use their international contacts
and expertise to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and
medical gear, particularly from China-based supply and purchasing chains.
IBM X-Force IRIS’ research indicates that the threat actors behind this campaign targeted
more than 100 high ranking executives in management and procurement roles within this
organization and its third-party ecosystem. Overall, IBM X-Force IRIS observed
approximately 40 organizations being targeted in this campaign. Given the extensive
targeting observed of this supply chain, it’s likely that additional members of the task force
could be targets of interest in this malicious campaign, requiring increased vigilance. IBM XForce IRIS has notified CERT BUND about this activity to further ensure members are
aware.
This discovery represents a precision-targeting campaign exploiting the race to secure
essential PPE. Based on our analysis, attackers likely intended to compromise a single
international company’s global procurement operations, along with their partner
environments devoted to a new government-led purchasing and logistics structure.

Targeting New Medical Equipment Procurement Structures
On 30 March 2020, German government officials met with several top German MNCs to
establish new ‘framework agreements’ to commission these nine companies to leverage their
access to foreign markets to purchase and facilitate the delivery of PPE on behalf of various
German Ministries.
Our research shows that, on this same date, suspicious activity from a Russia-based IP
address toward the MNC began. Specifically, IBM X-Force IRIS discovered over 280 URLs
tied to the suspicious Russia-based IP address 178[.]159[.]36[.]183, with more than a third
including Base64 encoded email addresses belonging to suspected targets at the MNC and
its third-party supply chain partners. Approximately half of the encoded email accounts
belong to executives associated with operations, finance, and procurement within the
targeted corporation. The remaining half belong to executives at third-party partners,
including European and American companies associated with chemical manufacturing,
aviation and transport, medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, finance, oil and gas, and
communications.
As of the time of publication, this campaign remains an ongoing operation.

Credential Harvesting
IBM X-Force IRIS discovered that the URLs redirect the target emailed to a fake, actorcontrolled Microsoft login page designed to steal and exfiltrate user credentials to several
different Yandex email accounts.
It is unclear how many of these phishing attacks were successful, however through
credential harvesting, threat actors could gain access to the victims’ email accounts with the
potential to collect or exfiltrate data of interest, and/or move laterally through the network to
fulfill other actions on objectives.

Global Race for Resources
A global rush to obtain essential PPE for health care personnel has resulted in an
unprecedented leap in prices and competition for now-critical medical resources. To secure
vital supplies, nations across the globe have launched a bevy of national buying programs,
emergency state export statutes, and contracting initiatives to acquire the essential
equipment to address the rapid spread of coronavirus.

3/5

Given the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and fears of a pending second wave of infection, it
is highly likely criminal and state-sponsored actors alike will seek to exploit global
procurement and supply chains with the intention of either profiting from the crisis or
supporting the acquisition activities of their host nation.

Preparation, Planning and Practice
In this extraordinary time, many organizations across the globe are being called upon to
perform essential tasks to outfit, equip and support medical professionals on the frontlines of
a global crisis. These companies are now part of an emerging high value target group whose
reliance on digital technology to enable business practices provides a potential means of
compromise to malicious cyber actors. Now, perhaps more than ever, businesses must have
an actionable Incident Response Plan in place to prevent, react and recover from a cyber
emergency.
IOCs associated with this campaign are available via our Enterprise Intelligence
Management platform.
This campaign also underscores the need for organizations to address the risks from
phishing attacks. Phishing was the initial infection vector in nearly one-third of all cyber
incidents we investigated last year. Please read our previously published blog “State of the
Phish: IBM X-Force Reveals Current Phishing Attack Trends” to review ways to help mitigate
this threat.
