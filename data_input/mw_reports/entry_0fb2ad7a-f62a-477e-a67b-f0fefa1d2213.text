A new variant of Echobot botnet has been spotted to include over 50 exploits leading to
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in various Internet-of-Things devices.
Echobot was discovered in May and analyzed by security researchers at Palo Alto Networks,
who found that it incorporated 18 exploits at the time.
A week later, Larry Cashdollar from Akamai published his analysis, where he revealed that
the number of exploits in Echobot increased to 26, most of them being RCEs in several
networked devices.
The latest Echobot variant was found by security researcher Carlos Brendel Alcañiz, and
uses 59 different RCE exploits to propagate, according to a tweet he published today.

Just a couple hours ago I received an exploit targeting Asus devices. Nothing
interesting so far. The "richard" file is a shitty dropper, but the malware is just a bot that
propagates itself using 61 different RCE exploits. I guess Richard is trying hard to get
popular ^^ pic.twitter.com/xA1Tn2o3z1

Brendell says that he made the discovery after receiving weaponized code that targeted
security flaws in Asus devices. The list of payloads compiled by the researcher shows that
the operator relies on known exploits, some as old as 2010.
The malware dropper is hosted on an open server, in a file called Richard.

The interesting part is that the author seems to have thrown in exploits without targeting a
specific category of products. The code incorporated is available from multiple public exploit
repositories.
Brendel provided BleepingComputer with the exploits he found in this Echobot variant and
the products they target include an odd mix of hardware and software solutions: routers,
cameras, smart home hubs, network-attached storage systems, servers, database
management software, Zeroshell distribution.

It should come as no surprise that this botnet includes such a high number of payloads. The
malware is one of the hundreds of spin-offs from Mirai botnet, whose code is publicly
available, built for distributed denial-of-service attacks. This enables anyone to modify it to
their own liking.
It is unclear what the author of this variant is trying to achieve, but their endeavor definitely
shows how easily one can pick up malicious code and adapt it to their own needs.
