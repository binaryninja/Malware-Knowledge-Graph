While it's not kernel 0days or EMET bypasses, credential phishing has been a go-to in
attackers toolboxes for many years, rising to prominence during the run up to the 2016 US
Presidential Elections. Being able to access a target's email or files stored in the cloud
without burning your prized 0day has proven to be too much for even the most advanced
attackers to pass up. In this talk, we will look at how attackers have evolved and adapted
their credential phishing operations over the past 10 years, from changes in delivery
mechanisms to changes in persistence and exfiltration and how defenses have evolved
during that same time.
