AhnLab's ASEC analysis team is monitoring the situation in which about 47 companies and
institutions, including defense companies, are being infected with the malicious code
distributed by Lazarus Group in the first quarter of 2022, and seriously judges this situation.
It was confirmed that malicious behavior was generated by the INITECH process
(inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe) in the affected companies.
The following items were first checked for inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe on the victim system.
The inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe file is
It is an executable file of INISAFE CrossWeb EX V3, a security program of INITECH.
It has the same hash value as a normal file.
(MD5:4541efd1c54b53a3d11532cb885b2202)
It is a file normally signed by INITECH.
INISAFE Web EX Client was installed in the system before the breach, and no trace of
tampering was found.
It is executed by iniclientsvc_x64.exe at system boot time, and it was executed in the
same way on the day of the breach.
The confirmed inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe file is a normal file that has not been tampered with.
As a result of checking the process execution history and the code of the malicious code
SCSKAppLink.dll, it was found that SCSKAppLink.dll was injected into
inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe and operated.
SCSKAppLink.dll contains code that branches according to the injected host process. The
branch code is written to download and execute additional malicious code by accessing
hxxps://matric.or.kr/include/main/main_top.asp?prd_fld=racket when it is injected into
the inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe process and operates.
In the rest of the branches, it is supposed to determine whether svchost.exe, rundll32.exe,
and notepad.exe are injected, but the branch statement does not contain executable code, so
it is not considered to be a complete malicious code.
The inisafecrosswebexsvc.exe injected with SCSKAppLink.dll connects to the malicious code
distribution site, downloads the downloader malware main_top[1].htm file to the Internet
temporary folder path, and copies it to SCSKAppLink.dll.

The same malware was mentioned on a Symantec blog a few days ago. A blog titled “Lazarus
Targets Chemical Sector”, published on April 15th, describes the Lazarus attack group
attacking the chemical sector. It seems that Lazarus' attacks are expanding targeting major
industries such as domestic defense and chemical industries. ( https://symantec-enterpriseblogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lazarus-dream-job-chemical )
