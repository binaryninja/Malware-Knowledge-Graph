Emotet (also known as Geodo and Heodo) is a banking trojan, but it is also a modular
malware that can be used to download other malware as Trickbot and IcedID [8, 9, 13].
Emotet was observed for the first time in 2014 [9]. In January 2021, in a combined effort by
Interpol and Eurojust, Emotet was taken down [12]. However, Emotet rose again in
November 2021, and it has shown more activity since 2022) [6, 7].
Even though Emotet was born as a banking trojan, it evolved in time and became highly
modular threat. This evolution granted adversaries a tool for different purposes. Emotet can
be used as an initial payload and remain inactive for extended periods of time until the
adversaries decide to leverage it [10]. This feature of Emotet gives the adversaries the
flexibility to carry out a multi-stage infection process. This means that Emotet can act as
banking trojan, but also has been observed to drop additional malware in the infected
systems [1]. Emotet has the capability to gathering information of the infected systems and
the adversaries can evaluate the value of the asset [14, 15] Some analysis shows that
Emotet can drop CobaltStrike, which then drops ransomware [11]. For example, one of the
ransomware dropped by Emotet is Ryuk [9].

In the past few months, Emotet malware has been observed in the wild, and its detection
growth considerably [1]. Even though this Emotet re-appearance happened at (almost) the
same time as Log4J vulnerability was discovered, there is not enough evidence that these
two things are related. However, CobaltStrike, which is known to be related to Emotet, was
using Log4J vulnerability [4].
The reappearance of Emotet motivated our deeper research and effort to update the
detection ability for Global Threat Alerts customers. As a result of it, the customers of Cisco
Secure Network Analytics and Secure Endpoint using GTA get better coverage of the threat
now.
We summarize in this blog Emotet threat, it’s lifecycle and typical detectable patterns. In the
second part of the blog we show how to use GTA to detect the Emotet.

Summary of Emotet characteristics
Modular banking trojan
Downloader/Dropper
Polymorphic – can evade signature-based detection
Virtual machine aware

Emotet behavior
The attack flow is detailed in Figure 1. According to the analysis presented by Brad Duncan
[2], the attack vector seems to be phishing, via an email with an attached file (1). The file
contained in the phishing email, is an Office document (2). When the victims open the office
document files and enable macros (3) the Emotet DLL is downloaded in the victim’s device
(4). After downloaded, this DLL file is executed (5) and it generates the connection with
Emotet Command and control (6) [5, 7].

Attached files and PowerShell execution
Once the victim opens and executes the infected files and enables the macros (mainly with
docx or xml extensions), a command is executed to obtain and execute a HTML application.
The pattern of the URL observed for this step is the following:
hxxp://{IP address}/[yy]/[y].{html|png}
Where “yy” are usually two alphabetical characters.
For example, one of the of the URLs founded in the wild:
hxxp://91.240.118[.]172/hh/hello.png
Then, it downloads PowerShell payload then it leads to downloading Emotet binary, which is
a dll file from any of the given URLs contained in the URL described above. The format, in
this case can vary, some of the URL’s patterns look like this:
http://ttisecurity[.]com/cgi/7RFeiqkgymCs/
Where the regex is:
.*/(gci/){0,1}[a-z0-9\_]{3,20}$
Another pattern related to Emotet was
.*/(wp-admin/){0,1}[a-z0-9\_]{3,20}$

During the download of the Emotet payload, user agent pattern was, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows
NT; Windows NT %; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.%
DLL execution and Emotet C2
Once the DLL files is in the infected system, it downloads a PE file and then establishes a
communication with its Command and Control, using HTTP or HTTPS protocols, on ports 80,
8080 and 443 [2]. Even though some researchers claim there is no relationship between
Log4J vulnerability and Emotet, there are some common behaviours, as the use of the same
IPs for C2. For example, those IP addresses are both related to Emotet and Log4j:
250.21[.]2 and 116.124.128[.]206 founded in [4]
94.252[.]3
31.163[.]17
178.186[.]134
79.205[.]117

Detecting Emotet with Global Threat Alerts
GTA (Global Threat Alerts) detects Emotet as a High-risk threat. The threat description
includes the MITRE software code and the techniques used by Emotet.

Figure 2. Detail of Emotet description in GTA
The threat detail (see Figure 3) contains also extra information regarding the files that could
have been modified, deleted, or created by a particular threat. This information is enriched
with the analysis of Emotet samples in Cisco Threat Grid [16]. The patterns of the files that
could have been modified by Emotet, the probability of the malware behaviour, and the
severity level for each one of the events are provided. This extra information helps network
administrators and security teams to mitigate the threat not only in the network, but also in
the devices.

from Emotet. Includes probability of the event occurrence and severity level.
Figures 4, 5, and 6, show different asset details from Emotet Alerts. It is possible to observe
there the traffic from the infected device to malicious IPs, hosts, and domains that are known
to be related to Emotet. In the first case, the asset established communication with the
hostnames 201.213.32[.]59, 45.55.82[.]2 and 89.32.150[.]160 (Figure 4). In the second
example, the asset communicated with the hostnames robertmchilespe[.]com and
vbaint[.]com (Figure 5). In the third example, the detection found communication to the
domain 104.131.148[.]38 (Figure 6).

Emotet mitigation
To prevent Emotet, we suggest the following measures:
Block emails with any attachment files that are suspicious
Scan suspicious files before opening them
Isolate the infected devices from the rest of the network to avoid spreading
Restrict the use of PowerShell and remote tools if possible
Reset all the user’s passwords in the infected devices
Consider use 2FA (such as Cisco DUO)

Conclusions
We conducted research to find not only new IOCs (IPs, domains and samples) but also URL
patters related to this new Emotet wave to keep our customers up to date on the latest
threats evolutions. The processed IOCs are also seeds to machine learning GTA algorithms
which help to further enrich the detections. GTA users of Secure Endpoint and Secure
Network Analytics can detect Emotet in their systems, execute mitigation actions and stay
safe from the evolution of this threat.
