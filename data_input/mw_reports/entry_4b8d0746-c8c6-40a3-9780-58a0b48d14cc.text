Threat Analysis: Poison
Ivy and Links to an
Extended PlugX
Campaign
Key Points & Assessment:
Japan CERT identified a new Poison Ivy RAT variant
(SHA1 44073031790e5ba419374dc55f6ac1cba688b06c)
with updated C2 functionality.
The malware was created in September 2014 and uploaded to
Virus Total in January 2015. It uses the dynamic DNS-provided
C2 getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com. This domain has
resolved to at least 3 IP addresses: 210.121.164.186,
27.255.71.200, and 27.255.94.224.
I identified several decoy documents (see Maltego graph) that
deliver the PlugX malware and call-out to one of two IP
addresses mentioned above. These documents were reportedly
used in a campaign identified by SOPHOS that spanned from
September 2014 to February 2015. India was one target of the
campaign.
Given the infrastructure and timing overlaps, the Poison Ivy
sample discussed in this post was likely just one payload
involved in a broader campaign targeting India, the Tibetan
community, and others, that spanned from approximately
September 2014 to February 2015.
The Poison Ivy sample in this case thus appears to be tied to

attacks by one or more adversaries acting on behalf of
Chinese interests.

Poison Ivy: New C2 Proxy
Functionality
Poison Ivy (PIVY) is a well-known, fully-featured remote access tool
(RAT) that has existed since about 2005. It offers a user-friendly GUI,
a variety of plugins to enhance functionality, and can be found online
by any prospective attacker.
And, although anyone can acquire the tool, PIVY is often associated
with actors who have a nexus to China.

Threat Analysis: Poison Ivy and Links to an Extended PlugX Campaign – CYINT Analysis

The malware has been extensively documented–including its use in
espionage-motivated intrusions–and continues to show signs of active
development [1]. A recent blog post from Japan CERT (JPCERT)
details new Poison Ivy communications functionality. According to
JPCERT, the malware now uses HTTP POST requests (earlier variants
use a custom HTTP CONNECT request method) and supports proxy
authentication to command-and-control (C2) servers.
Because JPCERT has already tackled this variant’s communications
functionality, I will examine other aspects of the malware.

File & Execution Details
Unfortunately, we do not know the delivery vector or target. The
intended target may have been one or more Japanese organizations,
given that JPCERT was the first to dissect this PIVY sample.
Alternatively, it is just as likely that JPCERT simply observed attacks
against other victims.

The sample will write the file vscrta0ps.log to C:\Documents and
Settings\All Users\AppData\. There appear to be no legitimate
applications that would write this file to disk.
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\AppData\vscrta0ps.log

It will also run the below command:
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn Update Assist" /tr "\"C:\Do
cuments and Settings\All Users\AppData\vscrtapp.exe\"" /ru "system
""

This command will create a scheduled task named “Update Assist.” I
assume this is a non-English speaker’s attempt to create an “Update
Assistant” task name. This task will run the malware every minute on
the victim’s machine as vscrtapp.exe in the %AppData% directory.
The task therefore serves as a basic method of persistence, ensuring
that the malware runs regularly. I found no indications that the
malware creates any registry keys; the scheduled task appears to be
the malware’s only means of persistence.
It is not clear what, if any, legitimate EXE vscrtapp.exe is attempting
to mimic. One possibility may be NetApp’s Virtual Storage Console
(VSC) for VMWare (note that the below image is not the query I ran; I
simply wanted to show the similarity between the names). Although
developers of PIVY could easily change the name, the presence of the
vscrtapp.exe filename could serve as a simple host-based method of
detection.

The malware will set a mutex (it imports the function CreateMutexA),
although I was unable to determine the value.

PIVY Infrastructure
C2 communications will be made to
getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com using HTTP POST requests. It is
important to note that the domain jumpingcrab[.]com is a dynamic
DNS (DDNS) service. While not inherently malicious, DDNS
providers are often abused by threat actors so they do not have to rely
on static infrastructure; IP resolution for a host could change at any
time.
Analysis of an attacker’s infrastructure is thus made more difficult.
The use of DDNS also means that the relevancy and reliability of any
infrastructure pivots must be carefully considered.
Taking the use of DDNS into consideration, here are current and
historical resolutions for getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com

04:36:15

The timing of the earliest known resolution–210.121.164.186–
directly correlates with the first submission time of the sample. The
Passive Total heat map (shown below) tells us there were almost no
active resolutions for this host from February until late July suggesting
that the adversary may have observed the submission and deactivated
DNS for the host on or around January 19. (Unfortunately, the 12 day
gap between January 19 and the beginning of February is an
unknown.)

The host briefly resolved to 27.255.71.200 for one day in March and,
as of publication, points to 27.255.94.224 where we see eight
additional hosts (which also use DDNS domains):
www.yahoo.4pu.com
www.google.zzux.com
www.winupdate.ddns.ms
freemoney.ignorelist.com
www.micrsoft.ddns.ms
office.onmypc.org

Both winupdate[.]ddns[.]ms and www[.]micrsoft[.]ddns[.]ms
are undoubtedly attempting to resemble legitimate Windows and
Microsoft sites, respectively. However, it is unknown if any of these

hosts are related to the actors who created
getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com.

Related Threat Activity
There are several documents that appear to target victims interested in
Chinese affairs, attempt to install the PlugX malware (aka Korplug,
SOGU), and communicate to two of the above identified IP addresses
(210.121.164.186 or 27.255.71.200). PlugX is another ubiquitous
RAT commonly linked to Chinese threat actors.
Below are the documents and their relevant metadata (some details
were not available).

Two of the above RTF files (CHINA NEWS BRIEF 09 of 2015.doc
and Draft contract CMS Trg System.doc) exploit CVE-2012-0158
to install PlugX (aka Korplug/SOGU), which then calls
to 210.121.164.186, the IP that getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com
pointed to in January. The “China News Brief” document is shown
below.

I have not yet concluded what the contents of SHA1
c9f72a2d9f97951a1e73f8bb58d9846877757269 are. The
document contact list.doc (shown below) also installs PlugX
(SHA1 7d71593a7d159c754055e16c26b844112e7b4132, MD5:
5730866b34ef589bd398c9a9b6d7e307). This PlugX sample is
identified in a June 2105 Citizen Lab post about attacks on the Tibetan
diaspora in Hong Kong. (I hope to explore this connection in greater
details in a follow-on post.)

Interestingly, both CHINA NEWS BRIEF 09 of 2015.doc
and Draft contract CMS Trg System.doc are mentioned in a
February 2015 SOPHOS report. The report discusses PlugX attacks on
a variety of targets including those on India. The attacks reportedly
took place between September 2014 and February 2015. Our PIVY
sample was compiled on September 14, 2014 and submitted to Virus
Total on January 19, 2015.
In addition to the infrastructure overlap, this correlation in timing also
suggests that the Poison Ivy sample was just one payload involved in a
much broader, 5-6 month campaign targeting India, the Tibetan
community, and likely others of interest to China.
According to the SOPHOS report:
Not surprisingly, just like with several other campaigns, in this
case it was observed that different malware families
were distributed using similar carrier documents; only
the encrypted payload was replaced at the end of the file. The
shellcode used in the carrier was very convenient for this
purpose: the length and location of the final payload was stored
at the end of the file. It was possible to swap the payload
without needing to modify the exploit condition and the
shellcode itself.

Thus, our Poison Ivy sample in this case appears to be tied to extensive
attacks by one or more adversaries acting on behalf of
Chinese interests.
