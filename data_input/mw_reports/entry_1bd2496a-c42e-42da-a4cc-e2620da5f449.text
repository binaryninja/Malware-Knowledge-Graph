Instagram is on its way to hitting a billion users this year and with that kind of popularity
comes a lot of traffic. But lurking among all of many, many harmless comments that get
posted each day, there's also the occasional post instructing Russian malware how to get in
touch with its controllers. Because of course there is.
The Slovak IT security company ESET Security released a report yesterday detailing a
cleverly hidden example of such a post. And its hideout? A Britney Spears photo. Among the
nearly 7,000 comments written on the performer's post (shown below) was one that could
easily pass as spam.

The malware was situated in a Firefox browser extension pretending to be a security feature
and it would search for hidden links in order to connect back to its control server. And the
comment, now deleted, was actually a web address that required a fairly complicated, multistep process to decipher.
In this case, the malware went through all of the comments on Spears' Instagram photo and
computed a number, or a "hash," for each one, while it looked for a specific hash. When it
found the comment with the right hash, it would check it out for particular characters, grab
the letters that came after those characters and turn them it into a link. That link would then
let the malware connect to its controllers. Such a method allows the controllers to change
where it meets up with the malware without having to change the malware itself.
ESET Security said they thought this particular post was just a test and linked the malware
scheme to a group called Turla, a cyber espionage group that the company says has
targeted governments, government officials and diplomats for some time.
So, while that weird comment on your latest selfie might look like junk, it could actually be a
conduit for some Russian malware and the subject of some upcoming breaking news. Happy
posting.
