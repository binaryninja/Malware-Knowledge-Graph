Campaign
CryptoMix is another ransomware family that is trying to earn money by encrypting victims
files and coercing them into paying the ransom.
Until recently it was more known as CryptFile2, but for reasons unknown to us it was
rebranded and now it’s called CryptoMix.
It was observed in the wild being served by the Rig-V exploit kit.
This malware stands out from among others, but not necessarily in a good way.

Price
First unusual thing about this family is very large amount of money requested – 5 bitcoins is
an insane amount of money (especially considering that CryptoMix is really primitive under
the hood, but we’ll get to it). We don’t know how many victims have paid, but probably few
were desperate enough.
Additionally we have stumbled upon following comment discouraging anyone from paying
the ransom:

1/4

DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!!
we were infected and they asked for 10 bitcoins, after some negotiations the price was
lowered to 6 bitcoins. they provided 1 decrypted file to prove concept. we paid 6
bitcoins and they asked for another .6 as the c&c server will not provide the key due to
late payment. after promptly paying another .6 bitcoins (about $4800 in total) there has
been no communication from them! its been 2 weeks and nothing.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT TRUST THEM, THEY WILL NOT DECRYPT YOUR
FILES!!!!
We can’t verify if this is true, but it sounds plausible – if someone is desperate enough to pay
6 bitcoins for his files, he probably can be coerced into paying even more. As usual, we
discourage anyone from supporting the criminals by paying the ransom.

Payment portal
Additionally CryptoMix doesn’t have any payment portal in the Tor network. Or any payment
portal, for that matter – victim have to write an email and literally wait some time before
malware operators kindly send the decryption keys
(assuming that they will do it, instead of bargaining for even more money).
For example, ransom message can look like this (most recent variant):
Or like this (older variant):
We don’t think that this strategy was well thought out. First of all, using emails for
communication with victims is bothersome and need constant attention.
Automated portal would be much more reliable and secure for both sides. Additionally,
emails are prone to being deleted/locked, effectively cutting malware authors from their
“clients”.

Charity
Content of exchanged emails is very unusual too. Actors claim to be a charity organization (!)
that is going to sponsor presents and medical help for children. For example:
That’s really original, but unfortunately also obviously false.
Leaving aside strange quirks of ransomware “interface”, let’s get more technical. In its heart,
CryptoMix is just a bare bones encryptor – it doesn’t have any fancy features, it doesn’t have
a web portal, it doesn’t change user wallpaper, the only thing it does is encrypting every file
on the victim’s disk and on the mounted network drives.
CryptoMix is protected by a very primitive packer – the real binary is stored in resources, and
xored with a hardcoded key. For some reason, Cuckoo has problems with automatic
unpacking of cryptomixer, so we had to write our own unpacker. Using pefile and Yara is very

2/4

easy:
After decryption ransomware checks whether it’s being debugged – but no antiVM
techniques are employed, so everything works as it should under VirtualBox.
Before file encryption starts, the ransomware checks internet connectivity (using
InternetOpenUrl function). If everything is ok, an encryption key is generated on victim’s PC
and sent to the C&C server.
Otherwise, depending on malware version, either a hardcoded encryption key is used or
malware is spinning in an infinite loop until the internet connection is restored.
The main function can be expressed as follows:
After encryption key is generated/selected, it is stored in windows registry. Registry key used
for malware specific data varies depending on version, but for example
SoftWare\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Nodes Slots,
SoftWare\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\FlashPlayerPluginK or Software\Adobe Reader
LicensionSoftWare\AdobeLicensionSoftWare can be used (malware probably tries to hide its
presence by impersonating another software).
The list of supported extensions constains more than 1250 entries:
That’s quite a lot of extensions, but nothing special (for comparsion: CryptXXX supports 933
extensions, CrypMIC 901). Most unusual thing here is inclusion of another ransomware
extensions (for example .zepto, .locky, .crypt, .locked, .cryptolocker, .cryptowall, etc).

Encryption
Let’s get back to ransom message for a while:
Malware claims that our files are “encrypted with 2048bit RSA KEY”. Well, it’s not entirely
true. Yes, 2048bit RSA key is generated with windows Crypto API – but after RSA key is
selected, it is hashed with SHA256 to create a real encryption key and every file on disk is
encrypted with that key. Encryption algorithm used is AES 256 in CBC mode without
initialization vector.
Encryption routine can be summarized with this (simplified) code:
This function is called for every file, so hashing rsaKey and deriving AES key every time
doesn’t make much sense. But there is bigger problem with it – there is no need for such
things as “public” and “private” keys, because this encryption routine is entirely symmetric –
RSA serves here just as (unnecesarily slow) random number generator.
So yes, in a way RSA is “used for encryption”, but files are not encrypted with RSA and
encryption is entirely symmetric.

3/4

UserID given by CryptoMix is not random – it is generated from username and serial number
for first disk.
This doesn’t seem like a good idea, because UserIDs absolutely have to be unique, and
neither username nor volume serial number is designed to be unique – so userID collisions
are possible and very plausible (after taking low entropy of userID and birthday paradox into
account).
Why is this a problem? Because when UserID collision happens, malware creators have no
way of distinguishing two users apart – so they don’t know which encryption key belongs to
which user, and can’t send the right one. It’s also possible that in case of collision old key will
be overwritten in database and lost.
Finally, CryptoMix achieves persistence by copying itself to user documents and writing to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SoftWare\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key.
As a final measure, all shadow copies are removed (if user doesn’t have admin account,
UAC window is shown before):

Cryptomix Decryptor
Due to a cryptographic flaw in encryption, we are able to decrypt CryptoMix (and CryptFile2),
but only sometimes and only if files were encrypted with a vulnerable version.
If your files were encrypted by CryptoMix and you don’t want to pay a ransom, you can
contact us at [email protected] and we’ll see what we can do.
Please attach a single encrypted file without changing it’s filename after encryption (for
example warnings.h.email[[email protected]]id[7e5973f5e0ce337d].lesli).
