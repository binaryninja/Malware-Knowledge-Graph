In our earlier Protecting Against Active Directory DCSync Attacks blog post, we have seen
how attackers can replicate permissions and completely control Active Directory (AD)
infrastructure using DCSync attacks. Another devastating technique that attackers explore
against AD is the DCShadow attack. It is a method of manipulating AD data, including
objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the
behavior of a legitimate Domain Controller (DC).
A DCShadow attack allows an attacker with domain or enterprise admin privileges to create
rogue DC in the networks. Once registered, a rogue DC is used to inject domain objects
(such as accounts, access control lists, schemas, credentials, or access keys) and replicate
changes into AD infrastructure.

How Does a DCShadow Attack Work?
DCShadow attack shares similarities with the DCSync attack, which is already present in the
lsadump module of an open-source tool Mimikatz. A post-exploitation attack requires domain
admin or enterprise admin privileges on an endpoint. The following attack flow was
demonstrated with detailed steps at the Bluehat IL 2018 conference by Vincent LE TOUX
and Benjamin Delpy.
1. Registering the DC by creating two objects in the CN=Configuration partition and
altering the SPN of the computer used.
2. Pushing the data, triggered using DrsReplicaAdd , Kerberos Credentials Collector
(KCC), or other internal AD events.
3. Removing the object previously created to demote the DC.
Attackers can perform a DCShadow attack by installing Mimikatz on a compromised
Windows endpoint and starting the mimidrv service. To play the role of fake Domain
Controller, an attacker can execute the following commands to register and start a service
with appropriate privileges.

Let us take one scenario and see how an attacker attempts a persistence attack by
modifying the primaryGroupID attribute. An attacker can run the lsadump::dcshadow
command to modify the value of primaryGroupID to 512.

The following command can make domain standard users be a member of the domain admin
group.
lsadump::dcshadow /object:POC User5 /attribute:primaryGroupID /value:512

First, let us verify the primary group ID value before pushing AD data. As shown in the image
below, we can use the net group command to verify and confirm that the user POC
User5 is not part of the Admin group.

We will replicate the changes from the rogue domain controller to the legitimate one by
executing the following command.
lsadump::dcshadow /push

Let us verify again net group command output. As you can see, the same user POC
User5 will be part of the Domain Administrator group.
net group "Domain Admins" /domain

It is just as simple as shown above. Once an endpoint is a member of a domain
administrator or privileged group, it gets higher privileges in the domain and can compromise
the entire domain.

TrickBot is an example of a modular malware that used Mimikatz’s lsadump module to collect
valuable information and carry out attacks, such as DCSync, DCShadow, and the Kerberos
Golden Ticket compromise.

Detecting a DCShadow Attack
The DCShadow technique can avoid detections and bypass SIEM logging mechanisms
since changes from a rogue DC are not captured. The technique changes or deletes
replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. The SentinelOne
Singularity™ Identity solution detects DCShadow attacks targeting AD and identifies
suspicious user behaviors. The solution also triggers high-fidelity alerts and reports on rogue
Domain Controllers that can pose a serious risk to the organization’s domain information.

Mitigation Strategies
Security administrators can examine what real or rogue DC is as a mitigation strategy. Delete
the computer object that is not a genuine Domain Controller. It is also important to verify the
presence of computer objects in the Domain Controller OU and nTDSDSA objects in the
configuration partition of the AD.
The following investigation steps can also help security administrators to mitigate DCShadow
attacks.
Capture network traffic and analyze the packets associated with data replication (such
as calls to DrsAddEntry , DrsReplicaAdd , and especially GetNCChanges )
between DCs as well as to/from non-DC hosts.
Investigate Directory Service Replication (DRS) events 4928 and 4929 using Event
Viewer on the DC. Observe Destination DRA and Source DRA distinguished name
(DN) and validate the legitimate DN from Active Directory Users and Computers. Find
out any unauthorized DRA replication between domain controllers.
Monitor for Mimikatz command usage, for example, lsadump::dcshadow .
Monitor for SPN scanning tools usage. For example, the simple command setspn -Q
HTTP/* allows an attacker to find HTTP SPNs.

Investigate the usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs). Two types of SPNs
can clearly indicate DCShadow attack. A SPN is beginning with “GC/” is associated
with services by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU) and a SPN
associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface
(GUID E3514235–4B06–11D1-AB04–00C04FC2DCD2).

Conclusion
Attackers can utilize the DCShadow technique and perform more advanced attacks to
establish backdoors for persistence. The organization must implement continuous monitoring
solutions, regularly review system activities such as monitoring AD object creation/replication
and alert the security team to take necessary mitigations.
