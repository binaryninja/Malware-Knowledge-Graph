The Australian government has just recognized digital currency as a legal payment method.
Since July 1, purchases done using digital currencies such as bitcoin are exempt from the
country's Goods and Services Tax to avoid double taxation. As such, traders and investors
will not be levied taxes for buying and selling them through legal exchange platforms.
Japan, which legitimized bitcoin as a form of payment last April, already expects more than
20,000 merchants to accept bitcoin payments. Other countries are joining the bandwagon,
albeit partially: businesses and some of the public organizations in Switzerland, Norway, and
the Netherlands. In a recent study, unique, active users of cryptocurrency wallets are pegged
between 2.9 and 5.8 million, most of which are in North America and Europe.
But what does the acceptance and adoption of digital currencies have to do with online
threats? A lot, actually. As cryptocurrencies like bitcoin gain real-world traction, so will
cybercriminal threats that abuse it. But how, exactly? What does this mean to businesses
and everyday users?

What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is an encrypted data string that denotes a unit of currency. It is monitored
and organized by a peer-to-peer network also known as a blockchain, which also serves as a
secure ledger of transactions, e.g., buying, selling, and transferring. Unlike physical money,
cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means they are not issued by governments or
other financial institutions.

Cryptocurrencies are created (and secured) through cryptographic algorithms that are
maintained and confirmed in a process called mining, where a network of computers or
specialized hardware such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) process and
validate the transactions. The process incentivizes the miners who run the network with the
cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin isn’t the be-all and end-all
There are actually over 700 cryptocurrencies, but only some are readily traded and even less
have market capitalization above $100 million. Bitcoin, for instance, was created by Satoshi
Nakamoto (pseudonym) and released in 2009 as open-source code. Blockchain technology
made it all work, providing a system where data structures (blocks) are broadcasted,
validated, and registered in a public, distributed database through a network of
communication endpoints (nodes).
While bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency, there are other popular alternatives.
Ethereum took “smart contracts” up a notch by making the programming languages needed
to code them more accessible to developers. Agreements, or conditional/if-then transactions,
are written as code and executed (as long as requirements are met) in Ethereum’s
blockchain.
Ethereum, however, earned notoriety after a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Digital
Autonomous Organization (DAO) running on Ethereum’s software, siphoning US $50 million
worth of ether (Ethereum’s currency). This resulted in the development of Ethereum Classic,
based the original blockchain, and Ethereum, its upgraded version (via a hard fork).

There are also other notable cryptocurrencies: Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero. Litecoin is a
purportedly technical improvement of Bitcoin that is capable of faster turnarounds via its
Scrypt mining algorithm (Bitcoin uses SHA-256). The Litecoin Network is able to produce 84
million Litecoins—four times as many cryptocurrency units issued by Bitcoin. Monero is
notable for its use of ring signatures (a type of digital signature) and CryptoNote application
layer protocol to protect the privacy of its transactions—amount, origin, and destination.
Dogecoin, which was initially developed for educational or entertainment purposes, was
intended for a broader demographic. Capable of generating uncapped dogecoins, it also
uses Scrypt to drive the currency along.

Cryptocurrency mining also drew cybercriminal attention

2/7

Cryptocurrencies have no borders—anyone can send them anytime anywhere, without
delays or additional/hidden charges from intermediaries. Given their nature, they are more
secure from fraud and identity theft as cryptocurrencies cannot be counterfeited, and
personal information is behind a cryptographic wall.
Unfortunately, the same apparent profitability, convenience, and pseudonymity of
cryptocurrencies also made them ideal for cybercriminals, as ransomware operators showed.
The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies coincide with the incidences of malware that
infect systems and devices, turning them into armies of cryptocurrency-mining machines.
Cryptocurrency mining is a computationally intensive task that requires significant resources
from dedicated processors, graphics cards, and other hardware. While mining does generate
money, there are many caveats. The profit is relative to a miner’s investment on the
hardware, not to mention the electricity costs to power them.
Cryptocurrencies are mined in blocks; in bitcoin, for instance, each time a certain number of
hashes are solved, the number of bitcoins that can be awarded to the miner per block is
halved. Since the bitcoin network is designed to generate the cryptocurrency every 10
minutes, the difficulty of solving another hash is adjusted. And as mining power increases,
the resource requirement for mining a new block piles up. Payouts are relatively small and
eventually decrease every four years—in 2016, the reward for mining a block was halved to
12.5 BTC (or $32,000 as of July 5, 2017). Consequently, many join forces into pools to make
mining more efficient. Profit is divided between the group, depending on how much effort a
miner exerted.

and IP cameras became bitcoin-mining zombies]

Cryptocurrency-mining malware use similar attack vectors
Bad guys turn to using malware to skirt around these challenges. There is, however a caveat
for cybercriminal miners: internet-connected devices and machines, while fast enough to
process network data, don’t have extensive number-crunching capabilities. To offset this,
cryptocurrency-mining malware are designed to zombify botnets of computers to perform
these tasks. Others avoided subtlety altogether—in 2014, Harvard’s supercomputer cluster
Odyssey was used to illicitly mine dogecoins. During the same year, a similar incident
happened to US agency National Science Foundation’s own supercomputers. In early
February 2017, one of the US Federal Reserve’s servers was misused to mine for bitcoins.
Cryptocurrency-mining malware employ the same modus operandi as many other threats—
from malware-toting spam emails and downloads from malicious URLs to junkware and
potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). In January 2014, a vulnerability in Yahoo!’s Javabased advertisement network was compromised, exposing European end users to

malvertisements that delivered a bitcoin-mining malware. A month before it, German law
enforcement arrested hackers for purportedly using malware to mine over $954,000 worth of
bitcoins.

We’ve seen the emergence of hacking tools and backdoors related to cybercriminal bitcoin
mining as early as 2011, and we’ve since seen a variety of cryptocurrency-mining threats that
add more capabilities, such as distributed denial-of-service and URL spoofing. Another even
tried to masquerade as a component for one of Trend Micro’s products. In 2014, the threat
crossed over to Android devices as Kagecoin, capable of mining bitcoin, litecoin, and
dogecoin. A remote access Trojan (RAT) njrat/Njw0rm readily shared in the Middle Eastern
underground was modified to add bitcoin-mining functionality. The same was done to an old
Java RAT that can mine litecoin.
This year’s notable cryptocurrency-mining malware so far are Adylkuzz,
CPUMiner/EternalMiner, and Linux.MulDrop.14. All exploit vulnerabilities. Adylkuzz
leverages EternalBlue, the same security flaw that WannaCry ransomware used to
destructive effect, while CPUMiner/EternalMiner used SambaCry, a vulnerability in
interoperability software suite Samba. Linux.MulDrop.14, a Linux Trojan, targets Raspberry
Pi devices. These threats infected devices and machines and turned them into moneromining botnets.

Cryptocurrency-mining malware’s impact makes them a credible
threat
Cryptocurrency-mining malware steal the resources of infected machines, significantly
affecting their performance and increasing their wear and tear. An infection also involves
other costs, like increased power consumption.
But we’ve also found that their impact goes beyond performance issues. From January 1 to
June 24, 2017, our sensors detected 4,894 bitcoin miners that triggered over 460,259
bitcoin-mining activities, and found that more than 20% of these miners also triggered web
and network-based attacks. We even found intrusion attempts linked to a ransomware’s
attack vector. The most prevalent of these attacks we saw were:
Cross-site scripting
Exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft’s Internet Information
Server (IIS)
Brute force and default password logins/attacks
Command buffer overflow exploits
Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) arbitrary code injection
4/7

SQL injection
BlackNurse denial of service attack
These malware can threaten the availability, integrity, and security of a network or system,
which can potentially result in disruptions to an enterprise’s mission-critical operations.
Information theft and system hijacking are also daunting repercussions. These attacks can
also be the conduit from which additional malware are delivered.
Internet of Things (IoT) devices are also in the crosshairs of cryptocurrency-mining malware
—from digital video recorders (DVRs)/surveillance cameras, set-top boxes, network-attached
storage (NAS) devices, and especially routers, given their ubiquity among home and
corporate environments. In April 2017, a variant of Mirai surfaced with bitcoin-mining
capabilities. Mirai’s notoriety sprung from the havoc it wrought in IoT devices, particularly
home routers, using them to knock high-profile sites offline last year. Over the first three
quarters of 2016, we detected a bitcoin-mining zombie army made up of Windows systems,
home routers, and IP cameras.
From January 1 to June 24, 2017, we also observed different kinds of devices that were
mining bitcoin, although our telemetry cannot verify if these activities were authorized. We
also saw bitcoin mining activities surge by 40% from 1,800 triggered events daily in February
to 3,000 in March, 2017.
While bitcoin mining isn’t inherently illegal (at least in many countries), it can entail a
compromise if it doesn’t have the owner’s knowledge and consent. We found that machines
running Windows had the most bitcoin mining activities, but also of note are:
Systems on Macintosh OSes, including iOS (iPhone 4 to iPhone 7)
Devices run on Ubuntu OS, a derivative of Debian Linux OS
Home routers
Environment-monitoring devices, used in data centers
Android-run smart TVs and mobile devices
IP cameras
Print servers
Gaming consoles

Cryptocurrency-mining malware can make victims a part of the
problem
Cryptocurrency-mining malware can impair system performance and risk end users and
businesses to information theft, hijacking, and a plethora of other malware. And by turning
these machines into zombies, cryptocurrency malware can even inadvertently make its
victims part of the problem.
5/7

Indeed, their adverse impact to the devices they infect—and ultimately a business’ asset or a
user’s data—makes them a credible threat. There is no silver bullet for these malware, but
they can be mitigated by following these best practices:
Regularly updating your device with the latest patches helps prevent attackers from
using vulnerabilities as doorways into the systems
Changing or strengthening the device’s default credentials makes the device less
prone to unauthorized access
Enabling the device’s firewall (for home routers), if available, or deploying intrusion
detection and prevention systems to mitigate incursion attempts
Taking caution against known attack vectors: socially engineered links, attachments or
files from suspicious websites, dubious third-party software/applications, and
unsolicited emails
IT/system administrators and information security professionals can also consider application
whitelisting or similar security mechanisms that prevent suspicious executables from running
or installing. Proactively monitoring network traffic helps better identify red flags that may
indicate malware infection. Applying the principle of least privilege, developing
countermeasures against web injections, securing the email gateway, implementing best
practices for corporate mobile devices, and cultivating a cybersecurity-aware workforce are
part of a defense-in-depth approach to reducing an enterprise’s exposure to these threats.
Ultimately, however, the security of internet-connected devices against cryptocurrencymining malware isn’t just a burden for their users. Original design and equipment
manufacturers also play vital roles in securing the ecosystems they run in.
