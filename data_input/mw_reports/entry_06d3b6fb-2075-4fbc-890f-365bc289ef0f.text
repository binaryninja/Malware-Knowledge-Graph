Shining a Light on DarkOxide

Falcon OverWatch Team

September 15, 2021

Since September 2019, Falcon OverWatch™ has been tracking an as yet unattributed actor,
conducting targeted operations against organizations within the Asia Pacific (APAC)
semiconductor industry. CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks this activity cluster under the name
DarkOxide.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has not yet determined the motivation of this activity cluster, but its
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and target scope indicate it is more likely focused on
the theft of sensitive information than on direct financial gain.

Telltale TTPs Reveal a Cluster of Activity
The DarkOxide cluster exhibits a very specific set of TTPs that have changed very little over the
last two years.
Initially, the actor engages a target via a business-oriented social media platform under the
guise of carrying out a recruitment drive (to read more about this technique, see
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003/). The target is then encouraged to download a
lure document purportedly relating to a job opening. In reality, this file is a malicious executable

1/6

with a double file extension. The executables in these lures have used non-standard executable
file extensions such as .PIF (program information file) and .SCR (screensaver). As Windows, by
default, hides the extension of known file types, these files initially appear to be legitimate
document files when viewed in Windows File Explorer.
To date, the targets of the phishing attacks have included engineering staff with access to
sensitive documents and source code, indicating that theft of intellectual property is the likely
motivation for these operations.
The following screenshot shows the detection that appears in the CrowdStrike Falcon UI when a
victim runs one of these malicious screensaver files. In this case, the customer had enabled
preventions, allowing the pattern of activity to be recognized by the sensor and terminated
before the actor could complete the installation of their remote access software.

When the payload is executed, it utilizes a number of scripting interfaces, including PowerShell
and Visual Basic Script, to download a further malicious binary executable. This second
executable, also with a .PIF or .SCR extension, in turn installs a copy of the legitimate remote
access tool, Remote Utilities, with a preconfigured command-and-control (C2) address. In a
small number of cases in addition to Remote Utilities, the actor also installed the Total Manager
Pro file manager. It is likely that this was in order to conduct file system searches, or to package
files for exfiltration.
Although the Remote Utilities binary, rutserv.exe , is a legitimate signed binary, its use is
relatively rare across CrowdStrike’s customer set.
As of at least March 2020, this TTP has been slightly modified, removing the first stage
downloader and moving directly from the initial phishing attack to the installation of the Remote
Utilities software.

The following table shows how these TTPs have been shared across a number of intrusions
and how they map to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.

In June 2021, the cluster was observed deploying additional tooling to a host. Again these tools
were commercial off-the-shelf software. The tooling observed included:
Total Spy: a commercial spyware suite with capabilities including keylogging, screen
capture, messaging capture and social network capture
RDP Wrapper: an open source tool allowing RDP access to the host
DWServe: an open source tool allowing the host to be remotely controlled from a web
browser
In almost all cases, the cluster’s activity has been frustrated, either by preventions enabled by
the customer, or by early notifications from Falcon OverWatch, allowing the affected systems to
be contained before the actor could take further actions on objectives. In the single case where
follow-up activity was observed, it consisted of modifications to the registry in order to allow
further access to the host via Remote Desktop Protocol. (To read more about these techniques
see: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/ and https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/.)
Since CrowdStrike began tracking DarkOxide, the activity cluster has continued to conduct
operations against a number of semiconductor companies, almost exclusively located within the
South Asia region.

Your Best Defense Against DarkOxide
Over the past two years, Falcon OverWatch, alongside CrowdStrike Intelligence, has been
tracking an activity cluster, DarkOxide, actively targeting the semiconductor industry. Although
the actor’s TTPs have remained largely consistent, they have demonstrated the capacity to

3/6

adapt and improve their processes, having recently streamlined their activity by removing the
need for a first-stage downloader in their intrusion process.
Defenders in the semiconductor industry should be particularly alert to this activity, which drives
home the need to enlist end users as the first line of defense. The actor is actively targeting
employees via social media to gain initial access. Well-trained staff can be an asset in
combating the continued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.
As noted above, the Falcon platform can identify and prevent actors’ use of malicious files with
double extensions, but it is crucial the sensor is rolled out across the environment with
appropriate prevention settings turned on. Defenders can slow down malicious activity by
employing strict user account management based on the principle of least privilege.
Finally, but most crucially, this activity shows the lengths to which threat actors go in their
attempt to evade automated detections. Whether by gaining access through phishing activities,
or by using legitimate tooling to achieve actions on objectives, threat actors are always looking
for new ways to pierce an organization’s defenses. A managed threat hunting service, like
Falcon OverWatch, provides the continuous monitoring that is required to identify and disrupt
malicious activity before the damage is done.
