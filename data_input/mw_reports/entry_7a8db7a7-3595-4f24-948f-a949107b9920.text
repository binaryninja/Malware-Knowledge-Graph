BlackMatter: New Data Exfiltration Tool Used in Attacks
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/blackmatter-data-exfiltration

At least one affiliate of the BlackMatter ransomware operation has begun using a custom
data exfiltration tool in its attacks. Exmatter, which was discovered by Symantec’s Threat
Hunter Team, is designed to steal specific file types from a number of selected directories
and upload them to an attacker-controlled server prior to deployment of the ransomware
itself on the victim’s network.
This is the third time a custom data exfiltration tool appears to have been developed by
ransomware operators, following the earlier discovery of the Ryuk Stealer tool and StealBit,
which is linked to the LockBit ransomware operation.

Exmatter in action
Exmatter is compiled as a .NET executable and obfuscated. When run, it checks its
command line arguments for the following strings: "nownd" and "-nownd". If either is found, it
attempts to hide its own window by calling the "ShowWindow" API as follows:
ShowWindow(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainWindowHandle, 0);
In order to identify files for exfiltration, it will retrieve the drive names of all logical drives on
the infected computer and collect all file path names, disregarding anything under the
following directories:

1/5

C:\Documents and Settings
C:\PerfLogs
C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection\Classification\Configuration
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps
C:\ProgramData\Application Data
C:\ProgramData\Desktop
C:\ProgramData\Documents
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft
C:\ProgramData\Packages
C:\ProgramData\Start Menu
C:\ProgramData\Templates
C:\ProgramData\WindowsHolographicDevices
C:\Recovery
C:\System Volume Information
C:\Users\All Users
C:\Users\Default
C:\Users\Public\Documents
C:\Windows
It will also exclude files of less than 1,024 bytes in size and files with the following attributes:
FileAttributes.System
FileAttributes.Temporary
FileAttributes.Directory
It will only exfiltrate files with the following extensions:
.doc
.docx
.xls
.xlsx
.pdf
.msg
.png
.ppt
.pptx
.sda
.sdm
.sdw
.csv
It attempts to prioritize files for exfiltration by using LastWriteTime.

Files that match the criteria are then uploaded to a remote SFTP server using the following
parameters:
Host: 165.22.84.147
Port: 22
Exmatter also includes SOCKS5 configuration, but this is not used:
Host: 10.26.16.181
Port: 1080
When it has finished exfiltrating data, Exmatter starts the following process to remove any
trace of itself:
Filename: "powershell.exe"
Arguments:
-WindowStyle Hidden -C $path =
'[FILEPATH_OF_THE_EXECUTING_SAMPLE]';Get-Process | Where-Object
{$_.Path -like $path} | Stop-Process -Force;[byte[]]$arr = new-object byte[]
65536;Set-Content -Path $path -Value $arr;Remove-Item -Path $path;
This will attempt to overwrite an initial chunk of the file before deleting it.

Newer variants
Multiple variants of Exmatter have been found, suggesting that the attackers have continued
to refine the tool in order to expedite exfiltration of a sufficient volume of high value data in as
short a time as possible.
In a second variant, the directory “C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection\Classification\Configuration” has been replaced with “C:\Program Files\Windows
Defender Advanced Threat Protection" on the exclusion list. The file types “.xlsm”, and “.zip”
were added to the inclusion list.
A third version of note added a WebDav client. The code structure suggests that SFTP
remains the first choice protocol, with WebDav acting as a backup. The WebDav client uses
the following URL:
https://157.230.28.192/data/
The following file types were also added to the inclusion list:
.json
.config
.ts
3/5

.cs
.js
.aspx
.pst
In addition to this, Exmatter is configured to skip exfiltration for files with names containing
any of the following strings:
OneDriveMedTile
localeSmallLogo
VisualElements
adobe_sign
Adobe Sign
core_icons
A fourth variant contained updated SFTP server details:
Host: 159.89.128.13
Port: 22
The WebDav client used the following updated URL:
https://159.89.128.13/data/
Finally, the list of files for inclusion was updated by removing “.png”.

Veteran ransomware operators
BlackMatter is linked to the Coreid cyber crime group, which was previously responsible for
the Darkside ransomware. For the past 12 months, it has been one of the most prolific
targeted ransomware operators and its tools have been used in a number of ambitious
attacks, most notably the May 2021 Darkside attack on Colonial Pipeline that disrupted fuel
supplies to the East Coast of the U.S.
Coreid operates under a RaaS model, working with affiliates to conduct ransomware attacks
and then taking a share of the profits. Like most ransomware actors, attacks linked to Coreid
steal victims’ data and the group then threatens to publish it to further pressure victims into
paying the ransom demand. Whether Exmatter is the creation of Coreid itself or one of its
affiliates remains to be seen, but its development suggests that data theft and extortion
continues to be a core focus of the group.
