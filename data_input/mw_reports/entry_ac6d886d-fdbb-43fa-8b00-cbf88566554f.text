BitRAT malware has launched a new campaign targeting people who try to activate pirated
versions of Windows operating systems for free through unofficial license activators.
The criminals behind the campaign reportedly distribute the payloads in the guise of
Windows 10 Pro license activators and push them on webhards, online storage services
popular in South Korea.
Webhards are frequently used to create direct download links, which are then posted on
communication platforms such as Discord and various social media services. Due to their
widespread use and versatility, they have slowly become one of the most pervasive malware
distribution channels among hackers.
In the newly discovered campaign, the malicious file, named W10DigitalActiviation.exe,
mimics a simple, one-button unofficial Windows 10 activator. Upon pressing the faux
“Activate Windows 10” button, victims trigger the download of the BitRATpayload, which is
then deployed to %TEMP% as Software_Reporter_Tool.exe,configured to run at excluded
from Windows Defender’s detection mechanisms.
After the downloader performs the operations above, it deletes itself from the infected
computer in an attempt to wipe its tracks.
Judging from the campaign’s distribution manner and the presence of Korean characters in
some of its code snippets, security experts suspect Korean threat actors are behind the
operation.

BitRAT is a notorious remote access trojan (RAT) marketed on underground cybercriminal
web markets and forums. Its price tag of $20 for lifetime access makes it irresistible to
cybercriminals and helps the malicious payload spread.
Furthermore, each buyer’s modus operandi makes BitRAT even harder to stop, considering it
can be employed in various operations, such as trojanized software, phishing and watering
hole attacks.
BitRAT’s popularity arises from its versatility. The malicious tool can perform a wide range of
operations, including data exfiltration, UAC bypass, DDoS attacks, clipboard monitoring,
gaining unauthorized webcam access, credential theft, audio recording, XMRig coin mining
and generic keylogging.
