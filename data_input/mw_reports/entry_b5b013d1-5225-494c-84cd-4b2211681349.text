Iran’s domestic espionage: Lessons from recent data
leaks

By the Intel 471 Global Research Team.
In the last decade, Iran has undergone a quiet revolution. Since the“Green Movement”
uprising in 2009, more Iranians have dared to openly oppose their regime. The reasons
include accusations of elections tampering, global sanctions, increased inflation, heavy
investment of state funds in the nuclear and arming programs, and ambitious regional
policies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and others, amid a deteriorating socioeconomic
situation of the average Iranian.
There was a lot of talk in the past about Iran’s espionage measures and offensive cyber
activities targeting other countries. However, growing domestic unrest prompted the Iranian
regime to invest more resources in developing espionage capabilities aimed against its own
citizens. Additionally, the regime carried out tough measures against civil uprisings such as
cutting off the internet in the country for long periods of time and killing hundreds of
protestors.
During the past year, a number of online activists have leaked what they claim to be inside
information about the regime’s surveillance methods, in an attempt to expose the unethical
tactics used by Iranian security forces. Among the top whistleblowers are operators of the
Lab Dookhtegan (translated in Persian as “stitched lips”) Telegram channel and an activist
named Masoud Molavi. Molavi, assassinated by Iranian agents in November 2019, was a
former cybersecurity official behind the Black Box Telegram channel that was responsible for
many notable leaks of Iranian government information.
The series of leaks uncovered hundreds of documents that offer a glimpse into the way Iran is
spying on its own people. According to the leaked information, the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence Services (MOIS) developed
numerous tools, malicious software, surveillance systems and data analysis platforms, in
order to control citizens in Iran and abroad. Much of this activity allegedly was conducted in
the Rana Intelligent Computing Institute, an organization working under the Iranian MOIS,
involved in internal espionage by developing unique tools and gaining access to a variety of
foreign countries’ infrastructure.

Tools and Techniques used for Domestic Espionage
According to the information shared by these whistleblowers, Iran is heavily investing in the
development of customized tools and malicious software for domestic espionage. For
example, the Iranian regime developed a surveillance system dubbed Abi, which allegedly

was used to spy on political activists, human rights lawyers, regime opponents and protesters
by intercepting Bluetooth communications. According to an Iranian blog called
Arezooyenatamam, (translated in Persian as ‘an unfinished dream”), this system has been
installed on pickup trucks posted in strategic locations in Iran such as university campuses or
protest centers.

The Iranian regime also developed customized malware used for stealing information from
citizens. One example found in those leaks was called WinspySuite, a remote access and
information stealing malware that reportedly was used specifically to spy on suspects
arrested by the regime. Internally referred to as Peyvand, the malware allegedly was loaded
onto a target’s computer via a USB flash drive during interrogations or sent via a malicious
link to a victim’s email address. The regime also developed a remote access tool for Android
and iPhone mobile devices as part of a project dubbed Project 220. The malware purportedly
was able to steal sensitive data from a victim’s device, including call data, text messages,
contacts and locations.

Another malware project dubbed Project 420 aka Dolphin developed, deployed and
controlled an undisclosed mobile malware capable of collecting and analyzing information
about the activities of individuals and groups on social media networks including Facebook,
Twitter, and Instagram, and on messaging applications such as Telegram.
According to leaked information, the regime not only developed tools for stealing sensitive
data from its citizens, but also created designated platforms for the collection and analysis of
the data. A system dubbed Payamak was developed to store and analyze text messages from
targeted subjects. A software called Seraj was used as an analytical search engine for data on
suspects, employees, intelligence operations and arrests related to the MOIS. Another system
mentioned in reports dubbed Shojreh includes a mapping of family relations of Jewish
people in Iran and abroad.

Additionally, the IRGC and MOIS gained unauthorized access to legitimate services or
websites to spy on Iranian citizens. For example, the MOIS would compromise Iran’s
National Library computer network seeking to obtain personal information about users,
mainly students and political prisoners, and their topics of interest. The MOIS allegedly also
abused this access to send phishing emails with malicious attachments from the library’s
official email account.

Tracking Iranians Abroad
In addition to all of the above, the Iranian government is making great efforts to monitor
citizens going abroad by surveying and analyzing location data obtained from Iranian cellular
operators with a system called Pouya, and by compromising the infrastructure of foreign
companies.

In 2019, an unknown activist or group of activists launched a site called “Vagheyatepenhaan”
(translated in Persian as ‘the hidden facts’) to expose Iranian regime espionage-related
activity. The site contains a large section about espionage enterprises outside Iran that was
conducted to monitor the movement of Iranians traveling abroad. According to this
information, the regime gained access to computer systems of numerous airline companies in
Bahrain, Dubai, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Thailand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for data collection on flights of Iranian
citizens. In another case, leaked documents showed the government worked on a project that
aimed to compromise hotel websites in the Republic of Georgia, a neighboring country and a
popular holiday destination for Iranians.

While they can be considered revealing, It should be noted that these leaks provide a very
narrow window into the full extent of the Iranian regime’s priorities. However, the
information disclosed provides evidence that as time goes by, motivation to expose these
activities likely will remain high.
