Malware authors and distributors are following the ebbs and flow of the threat landscape.
One campaign we have tracked for a numbers of years recently introduced a new scheme to
possibly completely move away from drive-by downloads via exploit kit.
In this quick blog post, we will look at this new attack chain and link it with previous activity
from what we believe are the same threat actors.

FakeUpdates (SocGholish) lookalike
Our researcher Fillip Mouliatis identified a malvertising campaign leading to a fake Firefox
update. The template is strongly inspired from similar schemes and in particular the one
distributed by the FakeUpdates (SocGholish) threat actors.

However distribution and implementation are very different. Unlike FakeUpdates which uses
compromised websites to push their template, this one is driven via malvertising. Please note
the IP addresses involved in the redirection infrastructure as we will come back to them in a
moment.

The template itself is much more simplified and appears to be in development with a fake
Firefox update that contains a couple of scripts that pull down an encrypted payload. The
initial executable consists of a loader which retrieves a piece of Adware detected as
BrowserAssistant. This payload was seen before and interestingly through a similar
malvertising campaign involving the RIG exploit kit.

MakeMoney connection
The malvertising infrastructure is essentially the same one that was used in numerous driveby campaigns with exploit kits since late 2019. For some reason the threat actors are reusing
the same servers in Russia and naming their malvertising gates after different ad networks.
Security researcher @na0_sec saw the “MakeMoney gate”, named after the domain
makemoneywithus[.]work (188.225.75.54), redirect to the Fallout exploit kit in October 2020,
although it mostly used RIG EK for several years. Probably the earliest instance of this threat
group was seen in December 2019 via the gate gettime[.]xyz (185.220.35.26).

Looking at this infrastructure shows that the group reused a few servers quite predictably
during these years between AS59504 vpsville and AS9123 TimeWeb. For example,
gettime[.]xyz was hosted on the same server (185.220.35.26) as makemoneyeazzywith[.]me.
Staying with the MakeMoney theme, we see makemoneywith[.]us on 188.225.75[.]54. That
server was likely hosting a Keitaro TDS given such hostnames as keitarotrafficdelivery[.]xyz.
There is also activity on 185.220.33.3, 185.230.140.210 and 188.225.75.54 hosting a
number of impersonation hostnames such as magicpropeller[.]xyz (PropellerAds),
magicpopcash[.]xyz (PopCash).

We find it interesting that the same threat actors remained faithful to RIG EK for so long
during a period where exploit kits were going out of business. They also seemed to poke fun
at the same ad networks they were abusing, unless the choice for names associated with
their gates was motivated by sorting out their upstream traffic.
We don’t believe we have seen the last of this threat group. Having said that, their latest
social engineering scheme could use some improvements to remove some blatant typos
while their server-side infrastructure could be tidied up.
