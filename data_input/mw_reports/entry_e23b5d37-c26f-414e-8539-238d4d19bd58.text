The Many Roads Leading To Agent Tesla
trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/the-many-roads-leading-to-agent-tesla/

Agent Tesla is a common Remote Access Trojan (RAT) discovered in 2014. This threat is
capable of keylogging, screen capture, form-grabbing, and stealing credentials from a wide
range of FTP, VPN, browser, and email clients. The exfiltration method depends on what the
attacker sets on the configuration.
During the past months, we have found a resurgence of this malware being distributed via
spam, as a payload of other threats, and as attachments to the malspams themselves. In this
blog, we present three recent, yet quite different, spam campaigns leading to this threat. The
first two campaigns deliver Agent Tesla via interesting downloader attachments whereas the
third one distributes Agent Tesla directly in the malspams. The Agent Tesla samples we
observed send the stolen information through SMTP and FTP.

Figure 1: The process flow of spam campaigns leading to Agent Tesla malware

1st CAMPAIGN: Through a PowerPoint Slide Show (PPSX) Loader
The malspams relating to the first campaign contain a PPSX attachment that exploits an old
vulnerability - CVE-2017-0199 which allows attackers to perform remote code execution using
Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).

Figure 2: The malspam containing a PPSX attachment with CVE-2017-0199
The offending object inside the attachment AS_FedEx_AWB_00117980920AS.ppsx is
slide1.xml.rels. It contains a script moniker that, when triggered, executes a PowerShell
command.

Figure 3: The PowerShell command at object slide1.xml.rels
Once the PowerPoint file is opened, it initializes the script moniker and runs the encoded
PowerShell script. Decoding the PowerShell script reveals that it downloads an executable
hosted at discordapp[.]com, saves it to the %appdata% folder as NPHBEK.exe, then executes
it.

Figure 4: Decoded PowerShell command from Fig. 2
The downloaded file %appdata%/NPHBEK.exe is the Agent Tesla malware. It exfiltrates data
via SMTP. The data includes the username, computer name, and other system information. In
addition to that, stolen data will also be included in the email such as key captures, and stolen
credentials.
Attacker’s email address: b*****@wezbrd.xyz
Password: Ma************di
SMTP server: smtp.privateemail.com

2nd CAMPAIGN: Downloaded via a Compiled HTML (CHM) File
A Compiled HTML (CHM) Help file contains a collection of HTML pages with an index
compressed into a binary format. This file format is mainly used for documentation and help
guides. On rare occasions, this file format is also used by cybercriminals to distribute malware.
This second spam campaign has a CHM file contained inside an archive attachment, paving
the way to the distribution of Agent Tesla.

The CHM attachment 70127_YK90054_Consulta_del_cliente.chm has one HTML object.
When the CHM file is executed, the HTML object d5sd00.htm will be loaded by the Microsoft
Help Viewer (hh.exe). As the HTML Help window shown in Fig. 6 is displayed, the malicious
behavior of the CHM attachment starts to manifest in the background.

Figure 7: The PowerShell command triggered when CHM is executed
The HTML d5sd00.htm contains a Javascript code that will deobfuscate then launch the
PowerShell code also enclosed in the HTML file. The PowerShell then retrieves and processes
the obfuscated data at hxxp://egen[.]com[.]tr/7F[.]jpg which is again PowerShell code.

Figure 8: The data obtained from the URL shown in Fig. 8 and its deobfuscated code
The second PowerShell code contains 2 binaries – the first is the waves.dll file which is
obfuscated and the second is the GZip archive containing the Agent Tesla executable. When
this second-stage PowerShell runs, the binary waves.dll will inject the Agent Tesla malware into
MSBuild.exe.

In this Agent Tesla sample, the exfiltrated data will be delivered via FTP.

3rd CAMPAIGN: The “AstraZeneca” Agent Tesla
In the early days of the Coronavirus pandemic, we observed one of the malwares commonly
distributed via this theme was Agent Tesla. Recently, we have seen another spam campaign
taking advantage of the pandemic.

attachment

Attached to the emails is a RAR or ZIP archive file containing an executable file. The
executables we gathered from the malspams are .Net compiled around 700-900KB in size.
Statically examining the executables, we noticed the file properties were associated with the
company AstraZeneca, one of the Coronavirus vaccine makers.

Figure 11: The executable files obtained from the 3rd campaign
Using the tool DNSpy, we observed that the .Net files shown in Fig. 11 were compiled on the
same day the malspams were distributed. As the executables have encrypted data in the next
section, we used the tool MegaDumper to extract the objects wrapped in them. The extracted
objects are .Net Agent Tesla malware of which some were compiled a month earlier.

Fig.10
Just like in the first campaign, the data stolen from the infected system will be exfiltrated via
SMTP.
