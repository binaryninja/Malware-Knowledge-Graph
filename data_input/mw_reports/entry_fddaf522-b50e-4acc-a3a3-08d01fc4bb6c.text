Bottom Line Up Front
Recently, ZDNet exclusively reported a leak posted on a cybercrime community
containing details and credentials of over 900 enterprise Secure Pulse servers
exploited by threat actors
Since this leak represents an ever-growing ransomware risk, KELA delved into both
the leak’s content and the actors who were involved in its inception and circulation
This short research targets a specific tier of cybercriminal actors – Initial Access
Brokers. These are mid-tier actors who specialize in obtaining initial network
access from a variety of sources, curating and grooming it into a wider network
compromise – and then selling them off to ransomware affiliates
With the affiliate ransomware network becoming more and more popular and affecting
huge enterprises as well as smaller ones, initial access brokers are rapidly
becoming an important part of the affiliate ransomware supply chain
The list leak mentioned above seems to have been circulating between several
initial access brokers in cybercrime forums, and have been exposed by a LockBit
affiliate who regarded the actors as unprofessional
This event showcases the breadth of information that’s exchanged on cybercrime
communities and, in KELA’s eyes, emphasizes the need for scalable and targeted
monitoring of underground communities

RaaS Ecosystem 101
For the past year or so, the threat intelligence community has been closely tracking the
ongoing changes to the ransomware landscape – noting the shift in business models and
TTPs employed by ransom actors. While vendors may choose different terms – “humanoperated”, “multi-stage”, “targeted” and more – they all carry the same meaning: ransomware
actors are opting to go for targets that have more means and more incentive for payment, so
they can demand higher ransom amounts.
One major aspect of this trend, commonly mentioned in the media for its inherent flare and
optics, is the naming-and-shaming leveraging tactics used to further push ransomware
victims to pay.
Another aspect is the cooperation between actors facilitated by the rise of targeted
ransomware: in order to support work in scale, ransomware operators turn to partners and
affiliates to fulfill their remote access needs. This cooperation results in two distinct

stakeholders in the targeted ransomware-as-a-service supply chain: the ransomware
developers who supply the infrastructure, and the partners who supply the network intrusion
opportunities and deployment of the ransomware itself.

Generally speaking, the affiliates working directly with ransomware operators are highly
vetted, professional actors. At any given moment, most ransomware developers are
recruiting only a handful of affiliates – essentially creating a pyramid-like hierarchy; some
RaaS developers are very keen on their affiliates’ KPIs, with underperforming affiliates being
removed from the program.

Essentially, affiliates may be perceived as mid-level management. Facing constant scrutiny
from the developers and commission-based salary that’s dependent on successful network
intrusions, the affiliates’ needs to constantly gain more network access gave rise to another
actor type: the initial access broker.

Initial Access Brokers
Initial access brokers are generally lower-tier, opportunistic actors supplying the
affiliates with access-as-a-service: they obtain initial access to organizations and then
offer it for sale on the same underground forums occupied by RaaS affiliates. Affiliates then
buy these initial accesses, pivot and move laterally until enough control is obtained so the
ransomware can be spread and computers be locked.
Brokers and affiliates are not necessarily differentiated by their level of skill or expertise, but
rather by the monetization channels they choose to employ. While affiliates or ransomware
actors monetize networks by locking them and demanding ransom, initial access brokers are
use-case agnostic: they sell network access to any actor – financially-motivated APTs (such
as FINx groups), ransomware actors, data brokers, nation state actors trawling the
cybercrime underground for leads or essentially any threat actor that has a way to monetize
said access.

Monetizing network access in the cybercrime financial ecosystem is nothing new, and
initial access brokers existed long before the rise of targeted ransomware. However, they
tended to have less clients. Monetizing network access can be hard, since fraud actors –
who make up the lion’s share of active actors on most communities – are more interested in
credentials that can be easily converted to cash in hand, whereas sophisticated actors who
can monetize access to an obscure network were not, up until lately, in abundance. The
recently-established RaaS programs have simplified the process and provided easy
monetization channels for network access. These programs have enabled the entire
chain of actors to increase profits, as high demand for network access (by affiliates) creates
a higher supply of brokers dedicated to gaining network access.
In 2019, due the rising tide of RaaS operators, threat intelligence research efforts
started shifting towards access brokers as well. One of the notable actors to attract
major attention was the loose collective known as FXMSP, which operated across multiple
handles and communities. Others, such as “bc.monster” or “sheriff”, are currently becoming
increasingly active across Russian-speaking communities. Initial access brokers are, in fact,
becoming exponentially more prevalent in cybercrime communities; the amount of posts and
offers dedicated to monetizing network access has risen drastically in 2020.

The Value Proposition of Access Brokers
Key enabling factors for the prevalence of access brokers (and, indirectly, to the rapid
rise in targeted ransomware) are the automation and servitization of cybercrime.
Let’s take Remote Desktop Protocol – a key vector in targeted ransomware. A few years
ago, threat actors needed to employ a wide variety of tools to get access to a valuable,
functioning RDP server belonging to a corporation – including much time spent on
reconnaissance, brute forcing and nitpicking victims.
Today, one only needs to obtain an invite to one of the many Remote Access Markets and
browse the continuously-updated selection of compromised machines offered for sale. One
of the major RDP markets has lately also added a “CORP” flag – servers that are part of a
corporate network are marked (and priced) differently, so actors can easily spot them and get
the most bang for their RDP buck.

This wide selection of goods allows actors a higher volume of work. For a few hundred
dollars, initial access brokers can acquire multiple RDP corporate servers; from that selection
they can “groom” the ones that look interesting – perform some reconnaissance, escalate
privileges or install further tooling. Once a target is ripe and ready, it can be offered for
thousands of dollars on cybercrime markets where ransomware affiliates can acquire it and
move forward with the final attack.

This model creates different stakeholders in the supply chain – each with their own expertise,
scale of operations and profit margins. During each step of the process both the scope and
price of the access get bigger – yielding profits to each stakeholder, and creating small, selfcontained ecosystems that can support large-scale cybercrime efforts.
On August 4, 2020, ZDNet, in collaboration with KELA’s tools, exclusively reported on a
threat actor exposing a list of over 900 compromised Secure Pulse VPN servers – including
credentials, session keys and other sensitive information being exposed. This was an
interesting event for several reasons. First and foremost, the actual leakage provided
visibility into targeted servers being used as potential ransomware targets – which has great
intelligence monitoring value. Second, the leak – and the story behind it – provides an
interesting behind-the-scenes look into the activity on an initial access broker.
First, in order to understand the story behind the recent leak, one needs to get familiar with
the threat actors involved. The first – a man from Ukraine who, according to his posts,
started his hacking activities in 2016 – goes by the handle “Bassterlord”. According to the
actor’s own accounts, after launching spam campaigns designed to deliver trojans and
infostealers, he switched to targeting organizations under the mentorship of an unknown
threat actor who hired him in 2019 and provided counselling.
In a competition of hacking-related articles held on a Russian-speaking underground forum,
Bassterlord shared a writeup of his original story, of how his mentor offered him around $300
a month to send spam emails containing malicious attachments to banking and financial
organizations. The actors have targeted 12,000 companies over almost one year, though
they managed to infect only two of them. “Nothing worked for me, I was desperate,” shared
Bassterlord in this write-up. This was when his mentor taught him how to compromise
organizations via RDP. At the same time, Bassterlord claims that his mentor “got access to
Sodinokibi” – probably referring to the mentor becoming a Sodinokibi affiliate, showcasing
the typical relationship between an affiliate and a soon-to-be initial access broker. Eager to
get more money, Bassterlord switched to another TTP.
Bassterlord’s current primary TTP involves the use of an automated script weaponizing CVE2019-11510, an arbitrary file read vulnerability affecting Pulse Connect Secure SSL VPN,
which has lately become popular with ransomware actors. Moreover, he states that he
continues to work with his mentor and former employer, which is apparently still involved in
Sodinokibi operations.

Another threat actor involved in the story is named “uhodiransomwar” (from Russian – “Go
away, ransomware”), previously known as “m1x”. He is a veteran actor, active since 2009
(though freshly banned) on the same underground forum as Bassterlord. A major part of
uhodiransomwar’s latest activity is small-scale ransomware: he mostly shares data from
organizations he claimed to breach once no payment is received. It seems that he
sometimes acts independently, and is also self-associated with known RaaS actors – such
as LockBit.

In the last few weeks, Bassterlord and uhodiransomwar have been publicly clashing in the
forum – showing the contrasting views of a novice initial access broker and a ransomware
affiliate, respectively. These ongoing clashes have led to the credentials leak mentioned
above.

Setting the Stage: a Not-So-Great Initial Access Broker
On July 27, 2020, Bassterlord offered network access to a US-based, state-level government
organization for USD 8,000. The post claimed that the initial vector was VPN access which
then was leveraged into RDP. First responder to the thread was uhodiransomwar, who
claimed that the infiltrated network was shared between a few different actors – implying that
the backdoor Bassterlord was offering wasn’t exclusive and that he himself has access to the
server already, and therefore may be worth less than the price asked.

sale.

The actors continued their public discussion, with Bassterlord admitting that the initial VPN
access was indeed public knowledge – implying that multiple actors knew about it to begin
with. He later made the case that even though multiple actors may be aware of the access
itself, he’s not aware of the inner workings on the network – only to his own access,
leveraged into RDP. He also claims that in his eyes, network access – even if shared –
9/15

should be “first come, first serve”: the first actor to leverage it into a full-blown attack gets the
spoils. This exemplifies the role of an initial access broker in the ransomware supply
chain: they are the function that can take an initial lead to a vulnerability, and work it into a
full blown network access. Thus, several actors working on the same initial access may
come up with different results – creating an arms race between brokers and the affiliates who
drive them.
This dialogue, though appears to be superficial, showcases that uhodiransomwar was able
to identify the victim only through Bassterlord’s description of it – meaning he had actual
access to it as well. This fact implies that, somewhere, initial access brokers and affiliates
may have access to some shared database of breached entities.
Very quickly this proved to indeed be the case, as on August 3, 2020, uhodiransomwar
published the aforementioned Pulse Secure leak. In his main post, the actor claimed to be
tired of other actors posing these so-called “public” compromises as private access to
corporations and trying to profit off of them – hinting towards Bassterlord’s latest offers.

Bassterlord’s Little Black Book
Upon investigating the content of the leak, KELA was quickly able to match against several
network accesses offered by the actor – proving that the leak indeed was the source of
multiple (if not all) of Bassterlord’s offers as an initial access broker. Specifically, we were
able to trace servers back to the government entity mentioned in the paragraph above
– as well as another of Bassterlord’s victims: a university to which he sold access for
USD 12,000 on July 12.
After identifying several victims, we tried to get to the bottom of the list; where did it originate,
and was it really passed between actors who were discreetly sharing compromises? Digging
a bit back into previous posts by the actor, we found a reference in which Bassterlord
stated that he has potential access to at least 77 organizations known to be vulnerable.
In this thread, Bassterlord, somewhat braggingly, likened himself to Andrey Turchin – the
main figure behind the notorious initial access broker FXMSP – stating that “in the news,
they write that he [FXMSP – KELA] got access to more than 130 corporations. So… I’m
almost caught up with him”. To this post, Bassterlord attached a heavily redacted screenshot
of an Excel file that seems to contain dozens of entries, each one representing an initial entry
vector (assumed to be a vulnerable Pulse Secure server) to an organization.

Bassterlord’s post and a snapshot of his access list

The fact that Bassterlord was maintaining an active list of VPN-based accesses, coupled
with the fact that uhodiransomwar claimed to have knowledge and access to it, implies that
some version of this list was being shared or circulated internally between actors.
At times it seems that Bassterlord was trying to break out of the initial access broker
cage and monetize his network accesses via direct extortion demands. A now-deleted
tweet from July 11 by the actor taunts a Spain-based firm to pay within 5 days, or risk GDPR
fines. However, it’s unclear whether this claimed attack was carried out via actual
ransomware or manual extortion. Another hint to Bassterlord’s attempts to deploy
ransomware is his post from July 12, where he discontinued the sale of access to a Thailand
media company because it was “locked by me [him] personally”.

What’s in a List?
The full files leaked by uhodiransomwar and covered by ZDNet were in fact an archive,
containing over 900 txt files – each pertaining to an exploited Secure Pulse server, and
accompanied with notes taken by the actor who compiled the archive.
For example, 49 of the 900+ servers are noted to require two factor authentication in order to
login to the admin panel:

Raw notes from the leaked archive, mentioning servers with 2FA

Of the remaining servers, around 250 are noted to be “bad”, “invalid” or otherwise
inaccessible – and over 150 are noted as “need hash” (probably referring to a lack of a key
data point – a password hash or a key – within the data obtained from the server, probably
rendering it not as easily accessible).
Overall, it seems that around 400 of the servers included in the list are potentially valid and
can be leveraged to deploy ransomware. Of these, some have notes mentioning the name of
the company and, quite commonly, the organization’s revenue as well:

Notes mentioning potential victims’ revenue in a shortened notation. For example, “17m” (row 7) means
USD 17 million, and “3b” means USD 3 billion

13/15

Sifting through these notes, one can easily trace several multi-million dollar companies –
several of them public – as well as a few with over a billion USD in revenue. These findings
showcase the threat level that big, seemingly well-protected organizations may face
from relatively novice actors acting as initial access brokers.
Researching victims’ revenue is a very common practice for initial access brokers, whose
posts lately tend to mention revenue of their victims in order to entice potential buyers –
based on an assumption that organizations with higher revenues would have the potential for
a multi-million dollar ransom.

Sales posts made by initial access brokers noting their victims’ revenues

The real question to try and answer is: How many of the entries in the archive made it
past initial access brokers to ransomware affiliates – suffering a full-blown
ransomware attack. Here, the main obstacle in finding an answer is the sheer amount of
ransomware attacks that go unreported by the victims.
Still, we were able to track leads to several companies that are publicly known to have
suffered a breach that were mentioned in the files. For example, the file contains a mention
of a company known to have impacted by a naming-and-shaming ransom actor; while we
14/15

can’t corroborate a direct cause-and-effect relationship here, this leak still serves as a
reminder that monitoring cybercrime sources can prove crucial for organizations.
