Description

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi." When executed, "
for the user’s exchange and then loads a legitimate cryptocurrency trading platform with no signs of malicious activity.
CelasTradePro is extremely similar in appearance to a version of an open source cryptocurrency trading platform available around the same timef
Bitcoin Trader (screenshots 3 and 4). In addition to similar appearance, many strings found in CelasTradePro have QT Bitcoin Trader references a
to “Celas Trade Pro” including but not limited to:
--Begin similarities-String_ABOUT_QT_BITCOIN_TRADER_TEXT=Celas Trade Pro
QtBitcoinTrader
String_ABOUT_QT_BITCOIN_TRADER_TEXT=Celas Trade Pro is a free Open Source project developed on pure C++ Qt and OpenSSL.
julyighor@gmail.com (note: Ighor July is one of the developers of QT Bitcoin Trader)
--End similarities-The strings also reference the name “John Broox” as the author of CelasTradePro.
While the CelasTradePro application is likely a modification of QT Bitcoin Trader, the legitimate QT Bitcoin Trader for Windows is not available for
only as a Windows portable executable. This is a singular file named "QtBitcoinTrader.exe" and does not install or run any additional programs. Th
contains "CelasTradePro.exe," the modified version of QT Bitcoin Trader, as well as the additional "Updater.exe"
(bdff852398f174e9eef1db1c2d3fefdda25fe0ea90a40a2e06e51b5c0ebd69eb) executable not included with the original QT Bitcoin Trader.

Description

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi." "Updater.exe" has
as CelasTradePro. Updater.exe was likely developed under the name “jeus” based on the build path “Z:\jeus\downloader\downloader_exe_vs201
found in the code (partial origin of the name AppleJeus).
"Updater.exe" collects victim host information and sends it back to the server. At launch the malware first checks for the “CheckUpdate” paramete
the program. This is likely to evade detection in a sandbox environment. If the "CheckUpdate" parameter is found, the malware creates a unique i
following the format “%09d-%05d." It then collects process lists excluding the “System” processes and queries the registry at “HKLM\SOFTWARE
NT\CurrentVersion” for the following values:
--Begin values-ProductName (Windows OS Version)
CurrentBuildNumber (Windows 10 build version)
ReleaseID (Windows 10 version information)
UBR (Sub version of Windows 10 build)
BuildBranch (Windows 10 build branch information)
--End values-After collecting this information, "Updater.exe" encrypts the data with the hard-coded XOR key “Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y," prepends the encrypted data
header) and sends the data to "celasllc.com/checkupdate.php."
The malware also uses a hard-coded User-Agent string “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0” and multipart form dat
malware receives a response with HTTP code 200, it will decode the base64 payload, then decrypt the result using the hard-coded RC4 decryptio
“W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd." The raw data is then written to a file prepended with the “MAX_PATHjeusD” string.

Description

This OSX program from the Celas LLC site is an Apple DMG Installer. The OSX program has very similar functionality to the Windows program an
valid digital signature from Comodo. Again the installer appears to be legitimate, and installs CelasTradePro as well as a program named “Update
“/Applications/CelasTradePro.app/Contents/MacOS/” folder. The installer contains a postinstall script (see figure 6).
A postinstall script is a sequence of instructions which runs after the successful installation of an OSX application. This script moves the hidden “.c
file from the installer package to the LaunchDaemons folder. This file is hidden because the leading “.” causes it to not be shown to the user if the
Finder application. Once in the LaunchDaemons folder, this plist file will be ran on system load as root for every user. This will launch the Updater
CheckUpdate parameter.
As the LaunchDaemon will not run automatically after the plist file is moved, the postinstall script then launches the Updater program with the Che
runs it in the background (&). The package also has “Developed by John Broox. CELAS LLC” in the Info.plist properties file.

an encrypted and obfuscated binary which eventually drops FALLCHILL onto the machine and installs it as a service.
The FALLCHILL sample found by the cyber security organization had two default C2 server addresses:
196.38.48.121 – South Africa Internet Solutions, AS3741
185.142.236.226 – Netherlands Amsterdam Blackhost Ltd ISP, AS174 Cogent Communications
The C2 185.142.236.226 resides in the same Autonomous System Number (ASN) and ISP as the celasllc.com domain. Furthermore, these IP ad

FALLCHILL malware uses a RC4 encryption algorithm with a 16-byte key to protect its communications. According to reporting from the cyber-sec
published the original AppleJeus report, the key extracted from the FALLCHILL variant used in the Celas Trade Pro application is “DA E1 61 FF 0
EA E3 82 2B." This RC4 key has also been used in a previous version of FALLCHILL used by DPRK actors, as further documented in the US-CE

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
