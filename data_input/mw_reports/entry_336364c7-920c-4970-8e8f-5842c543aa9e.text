The Compact Campaign

SuMMARY
Phishing campaigns continue to utilize the disruption of the pandemic to target victims, and a new
campaign takes advantage of Zoom's rising popularity. Since December, the "Compact" Campaign
has been targeting thousands of users by impersonating a Zoom invite and is estimated to have
collected over 400,000 Outlook Web Access and Office 365 credentials. This campaign is unique
in its use of trusted domains to ensure delivery of phishing emails and preventing phishing pages
from being blocked. This is especially worrisome for organizations who will struggle to defend
against this attack.

The WMC Global Threat Intelligence team has analyzed the entire attack, including PHP code
used on the website, and has recovered stolen credentials harvested by the threat actors. The
analysis has linked email addresses to the responsible threat actors and found a history of these
threat actors performing attacks since the start of 2020.

IN DEPTH analysis
Email

1/17

This phishing lure delivery method was via email and appeared to be using an extensive email
address spam list to target victims. It's estimated that as many as 11% of users fall for phishing
campaigns and given the size of this attack it is logical that a large number of users fell victim to
the phishing site.

Figure 1: Initial Email Lure
The team reviewed exposed credential logs and estimated that approximately each campaign
collected 3,700 unique credentials. With multiple campaigns identified, the threat actor could have
upwards of 400,000 unique username password values.
The send field was spoofed to show it has come from Zoom but using
noreply@<companyName>.tld.
For example, from WMC Global, we would expect to see a from address, such as:
From: Zoom <noreply@wmcglobal.com>

DELIVERY
Many of the emails were sent using compromised SendGrid accounts. WMC Global worked
closely with SendGrid to terminate the sending accounts which were then restored back to their
rightful owners. We saw in later campaigns the threat actors pivoting away from SendGrid and
moving to MailGun to send the emails. We suspect this is due to the efficiency of us sending
accounts to SendGrid for termination.

Phishing site
The phishing site has distinctive fingerprints within the code. As a result, the WMC Global Threat
Intelligence team monitored and detected the phishing sites as soon as the landing page
infrastructure was available.

Figure 2: Initial HTML Code
There were two phishing landing sites in use in the December 2020 and January 2021 phishing
campaigns. In December, the landing page impersonated the Outlook Web App brand to trick
targets into entering their credentials. In January, the attacks changed to mimic Office 365 brand,
likely to capture more employee credentials.

Figure 3: OWA Lure
The source code contains several layers of encoding from the escaped source. When first
decoded, it reveals the headers, although there is a second encoding layer for HTML and CSS
elements. The header contains key information to assist in tracking the threat further.
While these campaigns always have the same double encoded content, the top header variables
change as the campaigns evolve or websites are taken down or detected.

3/17

Figure 4: Exfiltration Locations HTML
There are three primary inputs into the code:
1. The media host store - Which collecting images for the phishing page:
media = 'hxxps://applink[.]host/media/mediarounds/';
1. The exfiltration POST script – To POST credentials to and always stored on a different
domain:
b = 'hxxps://kedai27[.]com//appspy/gle21/off2/compact.php';
1. The redirect domain redirects the user once they have completed entering their credentials:
rdr = 'hxxps://login.microsoftonline[.]com';
The URLs above have been defanged for safety in this blog.

Figure 5: Decoded Source
The team tracked and monitored the website source code for this header, extracted the indicators
of compromise (IoCs), and then recovered victims from the exfiltration locations.

Exfiltration & Logs
Exfiltration is the method attackers utilize to move compromised credentials away from the initial
phishing website to locations where they can then access the credentials without revealing
information that could compromise identity. This attack used numerous legitimate compromised
websites to host the exfiltration code. This campaign used static .txt files for Exfiltration logs.

Figure 6: Victim File

The controlling threat actors periodically wiped and removed the credential file logs to prevent
other threat actors or security teams from discovering the phishing attack victims. The WMC
Global Threat Intelligence team monitored credential logs and identified multiple victims from large
and notable companies.
In mid-January 2021, the team tracked a pattern that emerged in a small number of logs
submitted and concluded a credential poisoning operation was being conducted to dilute the
legitimate credentials harvested by the threat actors. Some cybersecurity companies use
credential poisoning to hide legitimate credentials in pools of fake logins, causing the threat actor
difficulty detecting the authentic logins. Some threat actors may also poison the results of their
competitors. Many threat actors are cognizant of credential poisoning operations and frequently
validate credentials automatically upon ingestion flagging inauthentic credentials.

5/17

Exfiltration Code
This threat actor made a mistake and left a misconfigured exfiltration script, allowing WMC Global
to analyze the source code of the PHP file. At a later date, the threat actors left a web shell
exposed on the website enabling download of further copies of the exfiltration code.

Figure 7: Webshell #1

Figure 8: Webshell #2
Reviewing the script gave the team a complete understanding of how the threat actors handle the
POST data. The workflow is simple, but the code shows unusual complexities for credential
phishing actors, allowing WMC Global to assert that the threat actors possess a higher technical
aptitude. Initially, the POST information checks to ensure data is being POST to the page. A 404status page can occur when the page receives a GET request or an incorrect POST format. If the
data is in the correct format, the username, password, and "desc" inputs are assigned variables,
and the username and password are then automatically validated.

6/17

Figure 9: Message Write
The validation occurs by the threat actors attempting to log in to the user's IMAP email account.
The login attempt occurs within the code, and establishes an initial connection to a Microsoft email
server on port 993. The code then uses the built-in PHP function imap_open to open a connection
stream to the mailbox. If the connection succeeds, the email stream returns; otherwise, an error
occurs. This technique allows the threat actors to know which compromised users' credentials are
valid and have access to their email accounts externally. The result of the login test write to the log
file.

Figure 10: imap Code
$ipdat = @json_decode(file_get_contents("http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp?ip=" . $ip));
The attacker uses the geoPlugin service for IP enrichment. IP enrichment is a popular tool used
by threat actors to get additional metadata on an IP. The reason this data is required is due to
many large companies performing IP checking for login attempts. As a result, threat actors will use
VPNs and proxies to ensure they are in the same geographical region according to their IP
address when they attempt to access a user's account. Using the gathered metadata and checked
credentials, the data writes to the host's log file and emails a copy to the controlling threat actors.
The threat actors' emails are hardcoded and are referred to in the code.
$config['adminEmail'] = 'spyblessings2021@gmail.com,postmaster@spy224.host';
Above are two email addresses linked to the threat actors: SpyBlessings2021 and postmaster.
Because there is no digital footprint, WMC Global asserts these emails were registered solely to
receive the phishing logs. Three of the scripts were identified as used by the threat actors but are

7/17

only different in the email subjects. So far, the team has observed the following email subjects
being used:
"Off 365- Scrt@hed !nvesments"
"365-Inves!ment"
"Off 365- !nvesm3nt!s Cont@cts"
The team found three exfiltration scripts on two separate infrastructures used in the same
campaign using the same two email addresses. However, a third email address was found in an
unrelated campaign.

Code Overlap
While performing threat hunting, the team discovered a phishing kit targeting Office365 customers
using an identical exfiltration script as seen in the other campaigns.

Figure 11: Phishing Page from Code Overlap
The TTPs used in this phishing site differ vastly from the other campaign. However, there is
substantial code overlap. The admin email address was different within the script file, and the
email subject also differed, but the rest of the code was identical to the other campaign.
$config['adminEmail'] = 'john.broomfield640@gmail.com'
$subject = "New Data Received"
This code overlap implies two hypotheses:
1. The controlling threat actors utilize several different TTPs to distribute their phishing
campaigns, making tracking the actor more complicated. Ultimately, the phishing sites are
still controlled by the same threat actors each time.
8/17

2. Multiple threat actors are using the same phishing kit, which results in numerous TTPs. In
this case, the phishing kit is maybe for sale to various parties, or the phishing kit is old and
was not previously analyzed.
All the IoCs are available in IoC section at the end of this post.

History
The latest email campaigns have caused considerable attention to be drawn to the attackers.
However, the WMC Global Threat Intel Team has found evidence the same threat actors have
been active before, using the same TTPs but different phishing themes. Around August 2020,
several themes appeared impersonating Excel, Outlooks Web App (OWA), and Outlook Web
Access Exchange.

Figure 12: Excel Lure

9/17

Figure 13: OWA Exchange
Around the end of September, a new Office365 lure started to be used by the group, which is still
in circulation and is the more prevalent lure used. Additionally, there is evidence of some small
campaigns using lures, including 1&1 Ionos and Rackspace; however, these were smaller and
only saw a few runs.

Ionon Lure

These discoveries help the team understand the motives behind the threat actor group. They have
been in the cybercrime space for some time and are re-using effective TTPs, having gone
undetected and under-investigated previously.
