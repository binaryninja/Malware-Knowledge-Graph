your enterprise on a daily basis. Their goals range from espionage for technology
advancement and disruption of critical infrastructure to for-profit theft of trade secrets and
supporting a political agenda. You no longer have a malware problem, you have an
adversary problem, and you must incorporate an intelligence-driven approach to your
security strategy.
During this CrowdCast, you will learn how to:
Incorporate Actionable Intelligence into your existing enterprise security infrastructure
Quickly understand the capabilities and artifacts of targeted attacked tradecraft
Gain insight into the motivations and intentions of targeted attackers
