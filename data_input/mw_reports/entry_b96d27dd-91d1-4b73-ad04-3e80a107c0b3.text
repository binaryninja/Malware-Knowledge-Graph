While tracking the activities of the SideWinder group, which has become infamous for targeting the South Asia region and its surrounding
countries, we identified a server used to deliver a malicious LNK file and host multiple credential phishing pages. We learned that these pages
were copied from their victims’ webmail login pages and subsequently modified for phishing. We believe further activities are propagated via
spear-phishing attacks.
The group’s targets include multiple government and military units, mainly in Nepal and Afghanistan. After the gathered credentials are sent,
some of the phishing pages will redirect victims to different documents or news pages. The themes and topics of these pages and documents
are related to either Covid-19 or recent territory disputes between Nepal, Pakistan, India, and China. Furthermore, it seems that these lures
are distributed via phishing links.
We also found multiple Android APK files on their phishing server. While some of them are benign, we also discovered malicious files created
with Metasploit. One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political
map dispute, which seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spear-phishing portion. We believe these applications
are still under development and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future.
SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to
attack mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China using lure files related to Covid-19.

Analysis of the malicious document
The use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common infection vectors. We collected several different samples from the
campaign, including:
1.

An LNK file that downloads an RTF file and drops a JavaScript file

2.

A ZIP file containing an LNK file, which downloads an HTA file (with JavaScript)

3.

An RTF file that drops a JavaScript file

4.

A PDF file with an embedded JavaScript stream

5.

A DOCX file with an external link to an OLE object (RTF file), which contains and drops a JavaScript file

1/11

Figure 1. An example

of a downloaded ZIP file containing an LNK file that is used to download a malicious HTA file
All of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of files and then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used
to install the main backdoor + stealer.
The downloaded RTF files exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a file named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor +
stealer into a folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to execute the dropped files at a later time.

Figure 2. A scheduled task with a command to execute the
dropped backdoor + stealer
The content of the newly created folder contains a few files, including Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard,
FA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326ED850), which is a legitimate Windows application.

Figure 3. List of dropped files
This application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports.

Figure 4. DUser library as DelayImport of shell32 library

However, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp file in the
same directory.

Figure 5. Algorithm for

decrypting both main backdoor + stealer and configuration
The decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the first 32 bytes from the encrypted file and the payload are the remaining bytes.
The decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.

2/11

Figure 6. Decrypted main SystemApp with listing its classes and resources

In Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted configuration. After decryption (using the same principle as with the main
backdoor + stealer), the configuration reveals which file formats the attackers are targeting.

Figure 7. The decrypted configuration

The main functions of the backdoor + stealer are:
1) Downloading the .NET executable and running it
2) Collecting system information and uploading it to the command-and-control (C&C) server
3) Uploading selected files to the C&C server
The collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes
information such as privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs, running processes, processor information,
operating system information, timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop,
Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads, Users\%USERNAME%\Documents, Users\%USERNAME%\Contacts, as well as information on all
drives and installed apps.

The spear-phishing attack
We found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The
subdomains of these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their victims’ mail servers. For example, “mailnepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain “mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”. Digging deeper, we
found that it hosted several phishing pages.
These pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then modified for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login
credentials. Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the victims, finding the original webmail servers that they
copied to make these phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting.
Analysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims
sent out their login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to documents or news pages. These documents and
news are probably interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and log in to the phishing pages. While several of
the documents are related to Covid-19, we also found some documents or news related to territorial issues in South Asia, including:
“India Should Realise China Has Nothing to Do With Nepal’s Stand on Lipulekh” – a news article that discusses India-China conflicts in
May.
“India reaction after new pak map.pdf” – a document talking about India’s response to the new political map revealed by Pakistan in
August.
“Ambassador Yanchi Conversation with Nepali_Media.pdf” – a document describing an interview with China's ambassador to Nepal
regarding Covid-19, the Belt and Road Initiative, and territorial issues in the Humla district.
The following table shows their targets, related phishing domains, and lure documents used in each of the phishing attacks.

Android applications
We also identified multiple Android APK files on their server. Interestingly, these Android applications still seem to be under the initial
development phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no practical function for users.

Figure 11. The default Android icons used by the APKs
We noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP
demonstrates login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling application for the Indian-Nepalese political map
dispute. The first application is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one starts with an explanation of “Opinion
Writing,” followed by a survey.

Figure 12. Non-malicious applications “My First

APP” and “Opinion Poll”
Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will load extra code from the remote server configured in the sample.
While we were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests numerous privacy-related permissions like location,
contacts, call logs, etc., we can infer that it goes after the user’s private data. These two samples appear to be debug versions as they have no

activities or any other component except Metasploit.

Permissions
We also identified a malicious version of the My First APP application that added Metasploit whose class names have been obfuscated.

Figure 14. Malicious version of My First APP, which adds Metasploit

SideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs
disguised as photography and file manager tools to lure users into downloading them. Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the
malicious APKs launch a series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to stealthily deploy the payload, as well as
exploiting CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to gather information from the
compromised device and then send it back to its C&C server.

In the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on
the Google Play Store, all the APK files found on their server are not mature enough for a deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the
initial stage, and the payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being refined further.

Conclusion
As seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending
topics like Covid-19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise their targets. Therefore, we recommend that
users and organizations be vigilant and follow social engineering best practices to protect themselves from these kinds of campaigns.
