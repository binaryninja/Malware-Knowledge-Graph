Recent reports have shown thatTrojan.Bayrob is scamming people again. The latest victim
lost over€5,000 to the scam but luckily was able to track down where the moneyhad been
sent. Unfortunately the final destination for the money was aWestern Union outlet in
Greece, after having been first sent through amoney mule in the US.
Once Trojan.Bayrob is executed on a user’s system it can interceptall traffic to eBay. It can
then show the infected user any contentthat it chooses instead of the real pages and it can
also alterinformation that is shown to the user from the real pages.Trojan.Bayrob is used to
scam people who are trying to buy cars oneBay.
The attack is a targeted attack and as such it is difficult toestablish the exact methods that
are used to distribute the Trojan;however, from evidence gathered thus far the attack works
in a mannersimilar to the following:
• The attacker posts an auction on eBay.
• This auction is used to gain information about potential buyers/victims.
• Anyone who asks a question about the auction may become a target.
• If a user asks a question about the item the attacker will reply,sending the Trojan disguised
as further pictures of the car for sale.In the past we have seen the file name
DisplayPics.exe used.
• The email may also give a plausible explanation as to why the car isa great offer. The
email also states that the car has been re-listed oneBay since it did not sell during the
previous auction.
• When the user opens “Displaypics.exe” the Trojan shows a slide showof the car for sale,
using “Kodak Viewer Express” however it also dropsanother file silently in the background
and executes it as well.
The images that were used in this case were for a Jeep:

At this point the Trojan is running in the background. All trafficdestined for eBay.com is now
silently intercepted by the Trojan. Then adecision is made as to whether the infected user
should be shown thereal eBay pages or if fake eBay pages should be displayed
instead.Anytime the infected user tries to view pages that are related to thecar they are
interested in buying, the Trojan will make the decision toshow fake pages instead of the real
eBay pages. These fake pages canshow a variety of fake information, including inflated
ratings for theseller and fake positive feedback for the seller.
The Trojan is specifically designed to make sure that the user does notnotice any difference
between the real content and the altered contentthat the Trojan returns. This all leads the
infected user to trust thatthe car auction and seller are trustworthy and to proceed to buy
thecar. While the auction looks completely legitimate on the infecteduser's machine, if the
same auction is viewed from a non-infectedmachine the difference can be seen
immediately.
For example, here is a screen shot taken from an infected user's machine:

In this shot the Trojan has silently altered the page returned fromeBay, it shows that the
seller has a feedback rating of 13, howeverwhen viewed from a non-infected machine the
seller had a feedback ofjust 1.
Since it was first discovered in March the Trojan has been underfurther development. The
Trojan can now intercept and alter trafficdestined for sites other than eBay! The ability to
intercept trafficfor the following sites has been added to the new version of the Trojan:
• www.carfax.com
• www.autocheck.com
• wwwapps.ups.com
• escrow.com
• my.escrow.com
• ecart.escrow.com
• www.escrow.com
This is very worrying as it shows the lengths that the Bayrob gangwill go to in order to
convince infected users that what they areseeing is real. Now even if a (infected) shopper is
very cautious anddecides to check the car out at sites outside of eBay (in this
casecarfax.com or autocheck.com) they will receive fake results also.
It is also very interesting to see that traffic for ups.com is alsointercepted; can the Trojan
also show fake information about apackages’ delivery status? We have not been able to
confirm this as yetbut it would fit with the pattern of this Trojan.

3/5

The site escrow.com has also fallen into the crosshairs of thisTrojan. It appears that even if
the user wished to pay via the escrowsite so as to protect their money, the gang behind
Trojan.Bayrob willbe able to detect this and intercept or alter that traffic also.
Of course the Trojan can still intercept traffic destined for the following eBay sites also just
as it could before:
• my.ebay.com
• cgi.ebay.com
• offer.ebay.com
• feedback.ebay.com
• motors.search.ebay.com
• search.ebay.com
• us.ebayobjects.com
• pages.ebay.com
• pages.motors.ebay.com
• motors.listings.ebay.com
• cgi1.ebay.com
From analysis of the sample involved in this case it is clear thatthis was a targeted attack
against a single user. This can be seen dueto the fact that there are specific details related
to the victimembedded in the executable. This means that every time the gang want toscam
a new victim they create a new, slightly different, Trojan thatcontains the specific details of
the new victim. This shows that thegang behind this Trojan are very involved in each
particular scam thatis perpetrated.
The most recent case of the fraud sheds more light on how the scamworks and what
happens to the money after the auction has ended. Moneymules in the US are recruited
before the scam takes place so that thevictim will not be suspicious about the destination of
the money forthe auction. Most people would be sceptical of sending money to Greecefor a
car on sale in the US for example. By using money mules in the USthe scammers avoid
raising suspicions about the auction until the moneyhas already been delivered to the
attackers via the mules. I suspectthat the attackers did not collect the money in Greece
themselves butrecruited other people to collect these payments also.
Money mules normally receive funds to their own bona fide USaccounts then withdraw it in
cash and send it to the operators of thescam via Western Union (in this case) taking a
percentage of the amountfor their part. The mules are often recruited in work-from-home
typescams – much has already been written on that subject elsewhere.
In the latest disclosed case the victim realized they had beeninfected by the Trojan when
the user posted to the eBay forum stating ascam had occurred. When other eBay users
checked the details of the bidthey informed the user that they were seeing different
information ontheir computers than what was being shown on the infected machine.

4/5

When the user viewed the bidding history on the infected machine, afake eBay page was
returned by the Trojan and this fake page showedthat the user had bid on a Jeep and had
won the auction. However, whenthe same page was viewed from an uninfected machine
there was no recordof the user's purchase of the Jeep.
The gang behind this Trojan have shown themselves to be veryorganized and skilled and
they possess many different abilities; theyare able to code in php, write Trojans, recruit
money mules, andorganize money drops. This is a sophisticated operation that has
becomemore advanced since it was first discovered in March with the additionof other sites,
such as carfax.com, ups.com, and escrow.com.
The Trojan is currently known to use the following servers:
• wmwbc.com
• vam-ars.com
• cameradealsusa.com
• michelleorea.com
Other servers are also being investigated as being part of the scam. Afirewall should be
used to deny access to the above addresses. EBayusers that have been affected by
Trojan.Bayrob are encouraged tocontact eBay and local law enforcement to report the
scam.
