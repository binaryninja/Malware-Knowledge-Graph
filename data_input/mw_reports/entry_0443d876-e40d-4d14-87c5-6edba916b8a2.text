RANSOMWARE REMAINS AN ONGOING THREAT
TO INDUSTRIAL AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
ENTITIES GLOBALLY
Although many ransomware strains impacting industrial control systems (ICS)
and related entities are IT-focused, such ransomware can have disruptive impacts
on operations. Ransomware can directly impact the operational technology (OT)
environment if it is able to bridge the gap between enterprise and operations due to
improper security hygiene. Ransomware can also have indirect access on operations
by impacting resources such as logistics, fleet management, sales operations and
fulfillment, or loss of view to enterprise resource management tools. Additionally,
in 2019 and through 2020, ransomware strains began incorporating ICS-focused
mechanisms, such as containing code that can stop industrial processes, which can
have potentially disruptive effects. Attackers are becoming increasingly hostile in
terms of attack behavior, including stealing data before deploying ransomware and
threatening companies with its release if ransomware is not paid.
Dragos monitors cyber events impacting ICS entities. IBM Security X-Force provides
incident response and intelligence services to organizations across a range of
verticals, including those with ICS and OT networks as part of their infrastructure.
Dragos and X-Force have observed a real appreciable rise in the number of both nonpublic and public ransomware events affecting ICS environments and operations.
Through joint collaboration, intelligence analysts mapped publicly known and
internal client incidents of ransomware attacks on industrial entities from 2018
through October 2020. The goal of this research is to identify trends, impacts, and
consequences of ransomware on ICS.
Dragos and IBM assessed 194 confirmed ransomware attacks against ICS and
supporting entities. Researchers found ransomware against ICS entities and
supporting organizations increased 75% in this timeframe, with activity peaking in
May 2020. Of the attacks in which the scope of impact is known, 56% of ransomware
attacks affected operations functionality at victim organizations, including in some
cases weeks-long downtime. Manufacturing was the most targeted industry,
followed by utility companies.
The information shared in this report is based on publicly available information as
well as data from incidents identified and responded to by X-Force and Dragos’
Services team. It is worth noting that entities who experience disruptive ransomware
events frequently do not report them unless compelled by regulators. Thus, publicly
reported details of ransomware attacks on ICS and related entities neglect to
provide a full picture of the threat landscape.

RANSOMWARE IN ICS ENVIRONMENTS

KEY FINDINGS
• Ransomware attacks on industrial entities
increased more than 500% from 2018 to
2020.
• Manufacturing entities comprise over onethird of confirmed ransomware attacks
on industrial organizations, followed by
utilities, which make up 10%.
• Newer ransomware strains have the ability
to stop industrial processes.
• Ransomware operators are increasingly
incorporating data theft and extortion
operations into their attack techniques,
potentially posing even greater impact from
ransomware than disrupted operations
through leaked intellectual property and
other critical data.
• Data stolen and leaked on publicly available
websites could provide ICS-targeting
attackers with victim data that could inform
or guide future ICS-disruptive attacks.
• Asset owners and operators should engage
in effective defense-in-depth security
strategies. Ensure an understanding of
network interdependencies and conduct
crown jewel analysis to identify potential
weaknesses that could disrupt business
continuity and production.

Ransomware Against ICS:
Definition, History, Implications
Malicious software that encrypts files and
disrupts computer operations for monetary

extortion, known as ransomware, has existed
for decades. It is a large and increasing threat
to ICS operations as ransomware attackers
recognize the value of targeting organizations
that have little tolerance for downtime—
including many manufacturing and energy
companies—and capitalize on that low tolerance
in an effort to more consistently extract ransom
payments from victims.
The WannaCry and NotPetya worms in 2017
crystalized the threat that ransomware and
disruptive IT malware posed to enterprise – and
in many cases industrial – operations. These
state-sponsored cyberattacks disrupted global
operations—from automotive production lines
to shipping and logistics to semiconductor
manufacturing. With automated functionality
leveraging vulnerabilities in Windows
computers, these worms spread quickly and
haphazardly across the globe.
Historically, cybercrime operators largely
t a r g e t e d v i c t i m s w i t h r a n s o mw a r e
indiscriminately and actors aimed to get
money from individual victims who would pay
to get their sensitive data – such as financial
or personal information – unlocked. In 2018,
criminal operators began shifting to what
is known as “big game hunting.” Human
operators specifically targeted a smaller pool
of corporate and government victims with
ransomware in an effort to receive a higher
payoff. The assumption was organizations
and corporations would be willing to pay larger
ransoms to prevent extensive downtime and
loss of productivity or revenue. An October
2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation alert
described the issue thus: Since early 2018,
the incidents of “broad, [indiscriminate]
ransomware campaigns [have] sharply declined,
but the losses from ransomware attacks have
1
increased significantly.”

RANSOMWARE IN ICS ENVIRONMENTS
Ransomware can be particularly disruptive to
industrial operations that rely on computerized
systems for things like production, automation,
quality assurance, monitoring, and safety.
Compromising the availability or visibility of
such industrial processes causes significant
downtime and can cost companies hundreds
of millions of dollars. Commodity ransomware
is generally designed to target Windows
machines due to the proliferation of such
devices throughout enterprises. And often
the technology within operations networks

– such as human machine interfaces (HMIs) or
engineering workstations – run on Windows
software and can be disrupted if attackers are
able to access it.
Concerningly, some ransomware types such
as EKANS have begun to adopt the ability to
disrupt industrial equipment.2 Written within
the code are mechanisms that can force stop
processes on certain HMIs, data historian,
and licensing servers, and the list of targeted
devices grows as new strains are found.

R A N S OMWA R E IMPAC T ING INDU S T R I A L
A ND R EL AT ED EN T I T IE S
Dragos and IBM identified ransomware attacks impacting industrial and related entities from 2018
through October 2020. Analysts have observed a real, appreciative rise in ransomware targeting
industrial organizations, and many of the incidents have resulted in disruption to industrial
operations.
Between January 2018 and October 2020, the number of tracked ransomware incidents impacting
industrial companies increased over 500%. In addition, analysis of the frequency of ransomware
attacks on industrial organizations per month indicates that attacks have been trending slightly
upward over time—with an all-time high in May 2020.

Figure 1: Percent of total ransomware attacks on organizations with or supporting ICS networks, 2018 - 2020

The increase in ransomware events in 2020 appears to coincide with the spread of the coronavirus
pandemic globally. Ransomware adversaries leveraged coronavirus-themed phishing lures for initial
access operations, preying on users’ concern for health and safety.3 In some cases, ransomware
adversaries are targeting cold storage facilities and biomedical, and pharmaceutical manufacturers
researching and developing virus vaccines and distribution methods, which could disrupt the
development and distribution of the vital drugs. 4

Analyst Note: Dragos and X-Force did not
include healthcare facilities and hospitals in
this research as they are not in scope of our
definition of industrial operations. However,
analysts must acknowledge the major
disruptions to healthcare and hospitals due to
ransomware, and the significant harm caused
by these events.5 The amount and scope of
attacks on healthcare entities is concerning
and Dragos assesses with high confidence
these attacks will continue, especially while
the industry remains under stress from the
pandemic.
Most ransomware attacks occurred in North
America, followed by Europe and Asia. In
fact, North America saw nearly half (45%)
of ransomware attacks on ICS-connected
networks since 2018, followed by Europe at
31% and Asia at 18% of total attacks we have
tracked.
The largest increase in targeting was observed

in the manufacturing sector, with the number
of incidents in that sector tripling from 2018 to
2020. Manufacturing was also the hardest hit,
experiencing 36% of all ransomware attacks
on ICS-related networks from 2018-2020.
Utility companies came in second, at 10%
of attacks—a percentage that has increased
dramatically since 2018.
Of incidents in which the scope of impact
is known, 56% of ransomware attacks
affected operations functionality at victim
organizations. Sodinokibi, Ryuk and Maze were
the most commonly observed ransomware
strains compromising industrial organizations
from 2018-2020. Specifically, Sodinokibi
accounted for 17% of the ransomware attacks
against industrial organizations where the
ransomware strain was known, while Ryuk
made up 14% and Maze 13%. Doppelpaymer
and WannaCry tied for fourth, at 7% of
ransomware attacks against industrial
organizations.

COMMON ATTACK PATHS

organizations with or supporting ICS networks, 2018 - 2020

RANSOMWARE DATA
Dragos and X-Force identified 194 confirmed
ransomware attacks impacting industrial
entities. The dataset includes managed service
providers and telecommunications companies
as these industries greatly support industrial
processes. Their functionality – including
mobile and satellite infrastructure and data
management and processing – can be deeply
integrated into OT environments.
A disruption to such integrations due to a
ransomware attack can potentially impact the
operations environment. Additionally, the data
includes ransomware attacks on government
entities only if they impacted utility operations.
The dataset only includes organizations
which experienced confirmed ransomware
attacks. It does not include organizations
listed on ransomware leak sites if attempted
or successful ransomware deployment and file
encryption could not be confirmed.

Despite the large number of ransomware
types, ransomware strains share many
commonalities in initial access, credential theft,
lateral movement, and encryption techniques.
According to data collected by Dragos and
X-Force, the most common initial access vectors
are phishing, remote services compromise
such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and
exploiting software vulnerabilities like virtual
private network (VPN) concentrators and
enterprise network equipment.
An April 2020 Microsoft assessment of common
human-operated ransomware families found
groups using common tools or built-in services
for credential theft and lateral movement
including Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, PSExec, and
the abuse of Windows service accounts and
management tools.6
Many human-operated ransomware strains
including LockerGoga, Maze, and EKANS
encrypt systems in the same effective manner:
Windows Active Directory compromise. Active
Directory is used for a variety of authentication,
security, and administrative services within
Windows environments, and a compromise
can enable an attacker to quickly encrypt
computers across the entire organization’s
domain.
The good news for organizations is that it is
possible to defend against many types of
ransomware by practicing proper security
hygiene as described in the Recommendations
section of this report.
The surge in attacks and attention paid on
ransomware has prompted companies to be
more proactive in their defense against the
threat. Such activities – like maintaining offline

CASE STUDY
One of the most common types of ransomware
attacks against ICS-connected infrastructure
is Sodinokibi (also known as REvil)—a malware
strain that accounted for more than one in six
ransomware attacks against industrial networks
from 2018-2020, according to X-Force and Dragos
data tracking. Sodinokibi first appeared in April
2019, and nearly 20% of the ransomware actor’s
claimed victims are in the manufacturing sector—
currently the top attacked vector by these threat
actors. Transportation, construction, and utilities
companies have also been targeted by Sodinokibi
ransomware.
Sodinok ibi operates as a Ransomware-asa-Ser vice (RaaS) car tel, where the malware
developers contract with other malicious actors
who infiltrate and deliver the ransomware to
victims—with the malware developers taking a cut
of the proceeds after a ransom payment is made.
Thus, the tactics, techniques and procedures
associated with Sodinokibi ransomware attacks
vary significantly, with each contracting threat

group using its own set of tactics to compromise
a victim.
X-Force and Dragos have both remediated
Sodinok ibi ransomwar e a t t ack s , and have
observed several sets of techniques associated
with these actors. In some cases, attackers gain
entrance to a network through vulnerabilities in a
Citrix server and then deploy CobaltStrike malware
and move laterally before deploying the Sodinokibi
ransomware. In other instances, attackers have
employed phishing techniques with malicious
attachments and then downloaded a Carbanak
backdoor to pave the way for a ransomware
deployment. In one Sodinokibi attack on an ICS
organization, attackers initially gained access
through a vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol
connection and were able to move laterally into
a portion of the network governing operational
technology. Once there, the at tackers were
able to encrypt several sensitive systems in the
OT environment—underscoring the threat of
ransomware to OT networks.

backups, developing incident response plans,
and practicing proper security hygiene – can
enable quick remediation and response in
the event of a ransomware attack. However,
this reduces the opportunity for ransomware
operators to make money, and many are now
incorporating data extortion into their attack
behaviors.
With this method, attackers will steal data from
a target company before encrypting affected
machines and then threaten to publish the
data online either on attacker-run websites
or hacking forums if a ransom demand is not
paid. Multiple ransomware strains leverage
the hack and leak technique including Maze,
DoppelPaymer, Sodinokobi, Netwalker, and
Cl0p.
Ransomware actors may collaborate with
other cybercriminal entities either via enlisting
hackers via Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
operations like Sodinokibi7 and Netwalker8, are
collaborating on leaking victim data by creating
“extortion cartels,” such as the Maze gang with
other operators.9
Sometimes the ransomware attackers may
not achieve encryption but will still hold data
for ransom. For instance, in August 2020,
Sodinokibi ransomware attackers targeted
a U.S.-based spirits and wine company. The
firm identified and stopped the attack before
systems were encrypted, but attackers still
stole sensitive information and leaked some of
the data on the Sodinokibi leak site.10

Ransomware attackers adopting the hack
and leak method is concerning for a variety of
reasons, including:
• Victims are unable to confirm whether data
is destroyed.
• Data stolen or leaked by attackers could
contain sensitive information on the target
company and customers that could aid in
future attack planning.
• Different regulatory and legal issues arise
from data breaches than ransomware.
• Data leaks provide additional incentive for
victims to pay a ransom—yet, when paid,
ransoms validate cybercriminals’ business
model and encourages additional attack
activity from ransomware cartels.
• Once information is stolen, victims generally
have no control over, or visibility into, what
attackers do with it.
• Releasing sensitive intellectual property
– for instance manufacturing details
– could enable counterfeit products
being produced. People can copy the
manufacturing process more specifically
creating better counterfeits.

STOLEN DATA PERSISTS
LONGER THAN
RANSOMWARE’S EFFECTS
Traditionally, ransomware attackers will
provide decryption keys to victims once a
ransom is paid, which confirms the criminal
upholds their end of the transaction. The issue
can be addressed within the confines of the
impacted network, with the victim maintaining
visibility into malicious activities. Data theft
and extortion activities introduce additional
uncertainty into the calculus, particularly since
an organization loses complete control over
sensitive data once it is released publicly. In
addition, the timeframe for potential damage is
not finite as with ransomware, but can extend
to months or even years. There is no way for
a victim organization to know with certainty
what a data theft has done with the victim’s
sensitive data, or what the attacker may do
with it in the future.

ATTACK PLANNING
Multiple ransomware and data leak incidents
identified by Dragos and X-Force have included
attackers leaking data relating to a victim’s
customers, including in the manufacturing,
utility, defense, and aerospace industries.
Although ransomware attackers may only be
interested in leveraging such data for financial
purposes – i.e. encouraging the company to
pay the ransom – attackers interested in
specifically targeting ICS could use the leaked
data to aid in attack development. Additionally,

even if data is not shared publicly, adversaries
could potentially buy data from ransomware
attackers. Sodinokibi, for instance, created an
auction site for interested parties to buy stolen
data with no limits on what will be done with
it. 11
An attacker focused on infiltrating or
potentially disrupting ICS could use stolen
victim and customer data to identify potential
opportunities for third-party or supply
chain compromise. Customers or employees
could be likely targets for phishing activity,
or sensitive financial data that could aid in
espionage operations. An attacker could also
use data like schematics, network diagrams,
or other internal documentation to identify
targets for operational gain and assess the
level of obscurity a target has from internal and
external resources.
For example, Dragos reviewed select files from
a compromised oil and gas services company
published on the Maze ransomware leak
website and identified multiple items of interest
in the publicly available data leak. This included
lists of companies that used the firm’s services,
employee information, natural gas flow data,
information related to a Canadian government
energy regulator, and geospatial data which
could be related to companies’ sites of current
upstream and midstream operations.
It is possible to see the value of such data
when mapped to frameworks such as IBM’s
Cyberattack Preparation Framework and
MITRE’s PRE-ATT&CK tactics. Data leaks
can facilitate external reconnaissance—a key
component of the “Prepare Attack” phase that
aligns with MITRE’s PRE-ATT&CK tactics12 of

infrastructure network.13 Public companies will
also report ransomware incidents that have
material business impacts in financial filings
with federal agencies but otherwise attacks
frequently go unreported.
Data breach laws vary globally, and not every
country has them. But such laws generally
require companies to publicly report incidents
when people’s sensitive data is lost or stolen,
including personally identifiable information
like email addresses, passwords, and human
resources records.14 In Europe, for instance,
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
rules govern data breach notification laws, and
in North America and Australia, privacy statues
vary between federal legislation and state or
territorial rules.

Figure 4: Cyberattack preparation framework
as mapped to MITRE PRE-ATT&CK

Ultimately, a company impacted by a cyber
data breach faces more legal hurdles and will
face more scrutiny than one impacted by a
ransomware attack alone—potentially causing
more financial and reputational damages.

LEGAL ISSUES

RANSOMWARE AND STATE

Government agencies globally encourage
companies to report ransomware and other
cyberattacks to authorities, but informing
customers, users, or the general public is
not required, except in some circumstances.

Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure
Protection (NERC CIP) regulations require
electric organizations supporting the Bulk
Electric System (BES) to report downtime and
remediation efforts if it involves the critical

Multiple government agencies attributed the

on industrial entities in Taiwan in May 2020. Known as ColdLock ransomware, the attacks targeted
Taiwanese companies in the natural gas, petrochemical, and semiconductor industries. Following
the attacks, Taiwanese authorities said that Winnti was responsible for the event.16
Dragos has explored the possibility that the 2019 LockerGoga ransomware incident that disrupted
operations at the aluminum manufacturer Norsk Hydro may have been linked to state-directed
activity.17 However, definitively linking or identifying ransomware attacks as potential cover for
state-sponsored activity is difficult, due to the commonality of the threat and similarities in behavior
across ransomware adversaries. It is likely that operators working on behalf of government-backed
actors will use ransomware in the future as part of their operations to obscure goals related to
espionage, disruption, or destruction of systems.

FUTURE PREDICTIONS
Ransomware will continue to be a major
threat to industrial operations in the future.
Despite efforts to improve security hygiene
across multiple business sectors, poor security
practices including improper segmentation
between enterprise and operations networks
will enable the infection and propagation of
ransomware across business and ICS systems.
Additionally, attacker behavior is adapting to
corporate ransomware security efforts and
expanding behaviors to include data theft and
extortion.
Ransomware operators will likely continue to
incorporate data theft and extortion techniques
into their ransomware campaigns—potentially
at increasing rates going forward, particularly if
current threat actors using this technique find
the business model to be successful. Dragos
and X-Force also anticipate that ransomware
attacks in the future will be used as a cover for
state-sponsored operations.
Dragos and X-Force assess with high confidence
that the threat of ransomware attacks to
ICS and OT-connected networks is likely to
increase, as future attacks build on the new
efforts of ransomware such as EKANS, capable
of disrupting industrial processes. This trend
is also driven by the growing adoption of “big
game hunting” efforts as well as data breach
components forcing companies to publicly
report incidents of compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS
• Conduct architecture reviews to identify all
assets, connections, and communications
between IT and OT networks. Identify

D R AG O S , I n c .

Demilitarized Zones (DMZs) to restrict
traffic between enclaves. Critically examine
and limit connections between corporate
and ICS networks to only known, required
traffic.
• Engage in effective defense-in-depth
securit y strategies. Especially for
ransomware attacks, having effective
preventative, detective, and corrective
controls in place is critical for reducing
risk. Even if malware can evade anti-virus
detection, endpoint detection systems and
other controls can stop the threat before it
spreads.
• Enforce Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
wherever possible. Focus critically on
connections to integrators, maintenance,
vendor personnel, and crown jewels such
as safety equipment. Ensure that critical
network services, such as Active Directory
(AD) and the servers hosting it, are welldefended and that administrative access to
hosting devices is restricted to the greatest
degree possible.
• Ensure remote access services such as
virtual private network (VPN) and Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections use
industry standard secure credentials and
cross to a separate OT domain.
• Ensure employees are trained to detect
phishing attempts and report to security
personnel when observed.
• Ensure backups of enterprise and
operations network systems are maintained
on a daily basis and test backups during
disaster recovery simulations. For greatest
security, store backups offline, but if this
is not cost effective, ensure that any main
network access to backups has only read—
not write—access to prevent attackers
from encrypting or destroying backup
files. Testing backup reconstitution plans
is critical.
12

RANSOMWARE IN ICS ENVIRONMENTS
• Create an ICS-specific ransomware incident
response plan and test this plan under
pressure using a tabletop or cyber range
exercise. These attacks move quickly, so
developing your security team’s muscle
memory is critical and can make all the
difference in preventing millions of
dollars’ worth of damage. Additionally,
these experiences can help address the
psychological impact of a breach event.
• Establish an alternate location from
which critical business functions can run
temporarily should a destructive malware

or ransomware attack occur. Organizations
that have been able to restore even some
business operations following a destructive
or ransomware attack have fared better
than their counterparts. This capability
allows your business to run even as attack
remediation is ongoing.
• Leverage industrial-specif ic threat
detection mechanisms to identify malware
within OT and reinforce defense in depth
strategies at the network level, leading
to a more robust investigation ability by
defenders and analysts.
