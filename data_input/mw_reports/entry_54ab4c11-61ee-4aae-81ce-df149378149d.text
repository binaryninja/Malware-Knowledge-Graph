Comments
Gheg, also known as Tofsee or Mondera, came across our radar in October 2008. It is not
as sophisticated as some of the other bots like Rustock or Srizbi, for example it does not
use a rootkit to hide itself. But it does a reasonable job sending spam at approximately 7000
messages per hour per bot using a template-based spamming engine. Gheg tends to
concentrate on pharmeceutical spam, using an Outlook Express template formatted in either
plaintext or HTML.

Features
Template Based spamming engine
Uses port 443 (SSL) to send and receive encrypted commands, spam templates and
download executable files.

Spamming Rate
7,000 msgs per hour per bot

Command and Control
The Gheg bot connects to its control server using a non-standard SSL connection on port
443. Samples we have analyzed connect to 208.72.168.140, establishing a connection to its
control server using the HTTP request like the one below:

1/3

GET /1464 HTTP/1.0
Host: <C&C server IP Address>
GET /3164 HTTP/1.0
Host: <C&C server IP Address>
After a successful connection, Gheg receives encrypted commands and spam templates
from the control server.

Malware Behavior on Host
Gheg drops a copy of itself in the following folder:
%userprofile% (C:\Documents and Settings\<username>)
%SystemRoot%\system32\ (C:\Windows\System32)
The malware filename format is 4-6 random characters with .EXE extension, for example:
%UserProfile%\rkux.exe
%SystemRoot%\system32\cvfjt.exe
A batch file was temporarily created to delete the main executable, it uses the following
format:
%temp%\removeme<4 random digit>.bat (where %temp% is Windows default
temporary folder).
To automatically execute the trojan in the system start-up, it adds the following registry
entries:
HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
"Userinit" = "%SystemRoot%\system32\userinit.exe, %userprofile%\<random
filename of malware.exe>"
HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
"<Random>.exe" = " %SystemRoot%\system32\<random>.exe"
Gheg also lowers Internet Explorer Security settings by modifying the following registry
entries:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings
WarnOnPost = hex:00,00,00,00,
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings\Zones\2
MinLevel = dword:00000000
2/3

RecommendedLevel = dword:0000000
1004 = dword:00000000
1201 = dword:00000000
1609 = dword:00000000
Gheg also sets itself to bypass the Windows firewall by using NETSH command (netsh
firewall set allowedprogram "<name of malware>") and to identify itself in the infected
machine, Gheg creates a mutex named "ghegdjf" - from which its name derives.
