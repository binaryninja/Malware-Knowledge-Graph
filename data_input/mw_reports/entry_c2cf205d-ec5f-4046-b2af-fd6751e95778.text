Rook ransomware is relatively recent, and one of the advantages of this line’s other threats is the multithreading engine that pulverizes the
encryption speed during its execution. In this article, we will go through the details of rook, describe the most effective techniques, and provide
some measures to fight ransomware in general.
Rook is a recent malware and a fresh variant of the leaked Babuk ransomware code. The source code was leaked in a Russian underground
forum in September 2021, and now criminals can perform changes or simply improve their arsenal by using the intelligence of this piece.

The malware was observed during a threat hunting activity by malware experts on VirusTotal. On Nov. 30th, 2021, the Rook operators claimed
the first victim: a Kazakh financial organization where criminals stole 1,123 GB of information.
As usual, this kind of threat is often implanted on internal networks via CobalStrike after a well-succeeded cyberattack. However, security
researchers found some phishing emails and torrent downloads with MS Office files infected with CobalStrike beacons to distribute the threat
around the globe.
At first glance, the executable seems to be packed with UPX according to the section names, and a string with suspicious length can be
observed — probably related to the key used during the encryption process.

Rook — technical details
After executing on the target machine, Rook tries to find a specific mutex “asfgjkl878645165456fa888” to avoid re-infection or simply create it if
the machine is a good candidate.

Drives and network resources with multi-threading power
Next, the malicious process continues, and the network resources and local drives are enumerated. After that, a multi-thread mechanism is
used to speed up the encryption process, as observed in Figure 4 below.

In detail, the malware calculates the number of threats that it needs to encrypt the files simultaneously (24 times the number of processors).

Preparing the encryption process
One of the main tasks before starting the encryption process is the creation of the RSA asymmetric keys. The ransomware uses the
RegCreateKeyExW API call to open the Software subkey available on “HKEY_CURRENT_USER.” If the public key exists, Rook uses it. On
the other hand, an RSA key pair is generated: “RookPublicKey” and “aRookprivatekey,” and the values are stored on the Windows Registry.
The described process is illustrated in Figure 6 below.

Terminate services and processes and skip folders and files
As observed in other ransomware families, Rook has hardcoded a list of services to be terminated before starting the encryption task,
preventing, thus, any errors affecting the encryption process.

The complete list of services is presented below.

Some specific folders can’t be encrypted and damaged during the ransomware execution, or the entire operating system breaks. A list of target
folders and files is also coded in a wide char array by Rook operators, as observed in Figure 9.

Ransomware note and encrypted files
A file called “HowToRestoreYourFiles.txt” is dropped during the ransomware execution with the instructions (ransomware note) to follow to
recover the damaged files.

In addition, the extension “.rook” is also appended to the damaged files.

Rook – darkweb website
As observed with other ransomware threats, initially, a demand for payment to decrypt the damaged files is suggested. If the victims don’t pay
the ransom, the Rook operators leak the exfiltration data by parts in an extended extorsion schema. This type of extortion scheme creates
tension and fear, forcing the victims to pay the ransom for the data.

Learning about rook ransomware
Rook ransomware is a recent threat within the malware landscape. It is based on the babuk leaked code and tunned into a powerful weapon
that can encrypt a target machine in minutes due to its multi-threading mechanism. Although there is no perfect formula to stop ransomware
infections, the implementation of monitoring and the usage of endpoint security solutions, updated antivirus, and the increasing use of canary
files are some of the mechanisms that could prevent the dissemination of these threats in the wild.
