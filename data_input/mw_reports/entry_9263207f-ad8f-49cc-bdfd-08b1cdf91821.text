Ransomware Groups Use Tor-Based Backdoor for
Persistent Access

Counter Threat Unit Research Team

In 2020 and 2021, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed
several threat groups using the official Tor client to create a backdoor with persistent access
to compromised networks via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Third-party researchers
documented similar activity during a mid-2018 intrusion. The Tor client can be used to create
a local SOCKS proxy that allows proxy-aware applications to access the Tor network. Tor
1/6

can also create Onion Services (originally known as hidden services) that can then be
accessed through the Tor network. The threat actors create an Onion Service that allows a
remote attacker to connect to the RDP service on the compromised host.
By default, Tor stores metadata used to maintain a connection to the Tor network in the
%APPDATA%\tor directory. The location of this directory can be changed by modifying the
DataDirectory directive in the configuration file. An alternative path to a configuration file can
be provided to the Tor client at runtime with the -f command-line parameter. The folder's
creation time is the moment Tor was first executed by the user. Within this directory, the
"lock" file's modification timestamp matches the time the Tor client was last executed. Tor
periodically updates the "state" file; its modification timestamp can vary up to a few minutes
from the Tor client's last activity.
While running, the Tor client maintains an open session with the Tor network that brokers
inbound connections to the Onion Service. When a remote attacker connects to the onion
address and port pair registered as the Onion Service, the connection is redirected to the IP
address and port specified in the HiddenServicePort configuration directive. When the
HiddenServicePort directive is configured as the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1), the
connection is redirected to the localhost.
Beginning in mid-2020, CTU™ researchers analyzed several incidents where threat actors
leveraged an Onion Service on a compromised system to redirect inbound requests to the
local RDP service. The financially motivated GOLD WATERFALL threat group perpetrated
two of these incidents, one of which included deployment of the Darkside ransomware. The
threat actors installed Tor into the C:\Windows\Inf\Usb folder and executed it via the following
command line:
C:\Windows\Inf\Usb\Tor\tor.exe -f C:\Windows\Inf\Usb\config.dat

To maintain the Tor client's persistence, GOLD WATERFALL used the Non-Sucking Service
Manager (nssm.exe) to install Tor as a service. Figure 1 shows the Tor configuration.

CTU researchers discovered another victim that had a domain controller containing an
identical setup installed during or before April 2020. This victim's network was not infected
with ransomware. It is unclear if GOLD WATERFALL had access to this host, but at the time
the group was a REvil ransomware affiliate.

In a separate incident observed in February 2021, a threat actor distributing the Snatch
ransomware set up a Tor backdoor using the configuration in Figure 2. The configuration file
and other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) match details in a June 2020 thirdparty report on Snatch ransomware activity.

To keep the Tor client running, the threat actors executed a service.bat Windows batch script
to create a service using the Service Control (sc.exe) command-line utility (see Figure 3).

Although the threat actors used these backdoors in all of the analyzed intrusions, it is
possible that the backdoors were created by initial access brokers (IABs) who compromised
the victims' networks. The IABs sell the credentials, a summary of the victim's environment
(number of endpoints, etc.), and the onion address hosted within the network.
The Windows event log writes the following three events when a threat actor successfully
authenticates via RDP exposed using this type of Tor backdoor. The data in the figures is
contrived for demonstration purposes.

Event 4624 Logon Type 3 (network) is written to the Security log. The account name is
the user whose credentials are compromised, and the workstation name is the
computer name used by the attacker (see Figure 4).

Event 1149 is written to the Terminal Services Remote Connection Manager log. The
expected source network address is the remote IP address of the connecting user, but
this activity uses loopback address 127.0.0.1 (see Figure 5).

Event 25 is written to the Terminal Services Local Session Manager log. This event
also contains the anomalous loopback address in the source network address field
(see Figure 6).

Tor is designed to operate within adversarial environments where governments or other wellresourced entities attempt to deny or monitor internet communication. Blocking published Tor
entry nodes at network egress points may be effective against Tor clients that use the default
protocol. Tor clients that use bridges and pluggable transports are much more difficult to

block because the infrastructure is more dynamic and cannot be compiled into easily
consumed lists. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are often capable of performing the deep
packet inspection necessary to identify obfuscated Tor traffic.
To mitigate exposure to this threat, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and possibly restrict access using the indicators in Table 1.
Additional information about the GOLD WATERFALL threat group that operates the Darkside
ransomware is available in the public threat profile.
