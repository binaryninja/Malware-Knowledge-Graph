In late 2020, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed a threat
actor exploiting an internet-facing SolarWinds server to deploy the SUPERNOVA web shell.
Additional analysis revealed similarities to intrusion activity identified on the same network
earlier in 2020, suggesting the two intrusions are linked. CTU™ researchers attribute the
intrusions to the SPIRAL threat group. Characteristics of the activity suggest the group is
based in China.

SPIRAL threat group’s SUPERNOVA deployment
During a November 2020 incident response engagement, Secureworks analysts observed a
threat actor exploiting a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion Platform to deliver the
SUPERNOVA web shell. CTU analysis indicates that this activity is unrelated to the
SUNBURST supply chain attack that trojanized the SolarWinds Orion business software
updates. CTU researchers attribute the SUPERNOVA activity to the SPIRAL espionage
group.
The threat actor exploited a SolarWinds Orion API authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE2020-10148) to execute a reconnaissance script and then write the SUPERNOVA web shell
to disk (see Figure 1).

commands executed on the host. (Source: Secureworks)
The reconnaissance script consisted of a series of commands concatenated using “&”. The
script wrote the output to C:\inetpub\SolarWinds\license.txt (see Figure 2).

The SUPERNOVA web shell was written to disk using a PowerShell command (see Figure
3). SUPERNOVA is written in .NET C# and is a trojanized version of the legitimate DLL
(app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll) used by the SolarWinds Orion Platform.

The attacker interacted with the SUPERNOVA web shell to conduct additional
reconnaissance activity using net, dir, and whoami commands. The threat actor obtained
credentials by dumping the content of the LSASS process using the legitimate comsvcs.dll
library (see Figure 4). The output of this process dump was also piped to the license.txt file,
which the attacker subsequently retrieved and then deleted from disk.

The threat actor then mapped network shares on two hosts: a domain controller and a server
that could provide access to sensitive business information. The immediate and targeted
nature of the lateral movement suggests that SPIRAL had prior knowledge of the network.
Intervention and remediation by Secureworks incident responders blocked additional
malicious activity.

Similarities to previous intrusion activity
Earlier in 2020, Secureworks incident responders identified intrusion activity on the same
network. Analysis suggested that the threat actor initially gained access as early as 2018 by
exploiting a vulnerable public-facing ManageEngine ServiceDesk server. The attacker used
the access to periodically harvest and exfiltrate domain credentials. In August 2020, the
threat actor returned to the network via the ManageEngine ServiceDesk server, harvested

credentials from two servers (see Figure 5), likely exfiltrated these credentials through the
ManageEngine server, and then used them to access files from Office 365-hosted
SharePoint and OneDrive services.

CTU researchers were initially unable to attribute the August activity to any known threat
groups. However, the following similarities to the SPIRAL intrusion in late 2020 suggest that
the SPIRAL threat group was responsible for both intrusions:
The threat actors used identical commands to dump the LSASS process via
comsvcs.dll and used the same output file path (see Figure 6).

November 2020 incident. (Source: Secureworks)
The same two servers were accessed: a domain controller and a server that could
provide access to sensitive business data.
The same ‘c:\users\public’ path (all lowercase) was used as a working directory.
Three compromised administrator accounts were used in both intrusions.

Connections to China?
CTU researchers have associated Chinese threat groups with network intrusions involving
the targeting of ManageEngine servers, maintenance of long-term access to periodically
harvest credentials and exfiltrate data, and espionage or theft of intellectual property.
Although SPIRAL activity shares these characteristics, the characteristics are insufficient for
attributing SPIRAL’s country of origin. However, an additional characteristic of the August
2020 intrusion strengthens the Chinese connection.
A Secureworks endpoint detection and response (EDR) agent checked in from a host that
did not belong to the compromised organization and used an IP address geolocated to
China. The naming convention of this host was the same as another host used by the threat
actor to connect to the network via a VPN connection. This ‘<Username>-PC’ naming
convention is the default hostname for a Windows 7 host, but it is not the victim’s standard

naming convention for hosts. CTU analysis suggests the threat group likely downloaded the
endpoint agent installer from the network and executed it on the attacker-managed
infrastructure. The exposure of the IP address was likely unintentional, so its geolocation
supports the hypothesis that the SPIRAL threat group operates out of China.

Conclusion
Similarities between SUPERNOVA-related activity in November and activity that CTU
researchers analyzed in August suggest that the SPIRAL threat group was responsible for
both intrusions. Characteristics of these intrusions indicate a possible connection to China.
The abuse of vulnerabilities in both intrusions reinforces the importance of applying security
updates as soon as possible. However, network breaches can occur even with preventative
measures in place. Organizations should consider implementing an EDR solution for realtime network monitoring and alerting. CTU researchers also advise organizations to prepare
and test a robust incident response plan.
Attribution is difficult, and members of the security community often have varying insights
and perspectives. To facilitate information sharing, the CTU research team has published
threat group profiles since May 2020. Fostering discussion within the community can lead to
a better understanding of the threats. CTU researchers welcome insights about the SPIRAL
threat group and its activity (threatgroupfeedback@secureworks.com).
