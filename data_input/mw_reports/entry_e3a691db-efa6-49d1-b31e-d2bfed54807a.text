Lojack Becomes a Double-Agent

by ASERT Team on May 1st, 2018

Executive Summary
ASERT recently discovered Lojack agents containing malicious C2s. These hijacked agents
pointed to suspected Fancy Bear (a.k.a. APT28, Pawn Storm) domains. The InfoSec
community and the U.S. government have both attributed Fancy Bear activity to Russian
espionage activity. Fancy Bear actors typically choose geopolitical targets, such as
governments and international organizations. They also target industries that do business
with such organizations, such as defense contractors. Lojack, formally known as
Computrace, is a legitimate laptop recovery solution used by a number of companies to
protect their assets should they be stolen. Lojack makes an excellent double-agent due to
appearing as legit software while natively allowing remote code execution. Although the
initial intrusion vector for this activity remains unknown, Fancy Bear often utilizes phishing
email to deliver payloads. NOTE: Arbor APS enterprise security products detect and block
on all activity noted in this report.

Key Findings
ASERT researchers identified Lojack agents containing command and control (C2)
domains likely associated with Fancy Bear operations.

Proof of concept in using Lojack as a backdoor or intrusion vector date back to 2014.
Its continued use suggest attackers could have used it in long-running operations.
Initially, the Lojack agents containing rogue C2 had low Anti-Virus (AV) detection which
increased the probability of infection and subsequent successful C2 communication.
The distribution mechanism for the malicious Lojack samples remains unknown.
However, Fancy Bear commonly uses phishing to deliver malware payloads as seen
with Sedupload in late 2017.

UPDATE
May 3, 2018 – After the disclosure of the malicious Lojack binaries, many AntiVirus vendors have been quick to respond in properly marking samples as
"malware" and "DoubleAgent", rather than "Riskware" or "unsafe" (Figure 2).
May 4th 2018 – UPDATE FROM ABSOLUTE SOFTWARE:
"The analysis of the samples provided by Arbor shows all were based on an
illicitly modified old version of the LoJack agent from 2008 and no
customers or partners have been impacted. For customers who wish to
confirm no legacy agents are present in their environment, we have
published an advisory with steps to verify all installed agents are legitimate
copies of the LoJack product.
May 9th 2018 – Disclaimer:
Prior reports have misidentified LoJack instead of Absolute LoJack for
Laptops, also known as Computrace. LoJack for Laptops and Computrace
are products of Absolute, not LoJack or CalAmp.

Lojack Summary
Absolute Software, the creator of Lojack, says on its website
(https://www.absolutelojack.com/) that the agent can locate and lock a device remotely.
Additionally, it can delete files, making it an effective laptop theft recovery and data wiping
platform. Lojack can survive hard drive replacements and operating system (OS) reimaging. The agent achieves this persistence through a modular design as noted by Vitaliy
Kamlyuk, Sergey Belov, and Anibal Sacco in a presentation at Blackhat, 2014 (Figure 1):

The aforementioned researchers suggest the binary modification of the "small agent" is
trivial. The Lojack agent protects the hardcoded C2 URL using a single byte XOR key;
however, according to researchers it blindly trusts the configuration content. Once an
attacker properly modifies this value then the double-agent is ready to go. This is not the
only aspect that makes Lojack an appealing target. Attackers are also concerned about AV
detection. Looking on VirusTotal, some anti-virus vendors flag Lojack executables as
”unsafe”, but as noted as of May 3, many AV now flag the binaries as malware and
DoubleAgent (Figure 2).

Originally, the low AV detection, allowed the attacker to hide in plain sight, an effective
double-agent. The attacker simply needs to stand up a rogue C2 server that simulates the
Lojack communication protocols. Finally, Lojack’s “small agent” allows for memory reads and
writes which grant it remote backdoor functionality when coupled with a rogue C2 server.

Lojack Double-Agent
ASERT has identified five Lojack agents (rpcnetp.exe) pointing to 4 different suspected
domains. Fancy Bear has been tied to three of the domains in the past.

Table 1: Lojack Double-Agents on VirusTotal

Binary Comparisons
ASERT believes all these binaries are rpcnetp.exe (small agent) due to the following
characteristics:
Size matching: 17,408 bytes
Yara match on either:
“TagId” and “rpcnetp.exe”
Set of op codes
Matching export function “rpcnetp” in the binaries.
After confirming the stage of the Lojack agent, binary comparison analysis confirmed that
they were legitimate Lojack samples. The comparison also highlighted that the attacker did
not graft additional functionality into the binary. ASERT used the presence of
search.namequery[.]com in the binary and the yara rule to identify legitimate Lojack
samples. Lojack’s Absolute Software Corp. owns search.namequery[.]com; we have no

evidence the legitimate site has been used for nefarious purposes. NOTE: All samples, both
rogue and the two “clean” samples (below), matched 100% based on Diaphora’s function
matching algorithm. “Clean” Samples:
1. e78e3b0171b189074d2539c7baaa0719
2. ac1a85d3ca1b6265cad4ed41b696f9b7
Only the presence of the rogue C2's make the samples in Table1 malicious. The attackers
are merely hijacking the communication used by Lojack, thereby granting themselves
backdoor access to machines running the software.

Fancy Bear Attribution
ASERT assesses with moderate confidence that the rogue Lojack agents are attributed to
Fancy Bear based on shared infrastructure with previous operations. The following domains,
extracted from the rogue Lojack agents trace back to Fancy Bear operations:
1. elaxo[.]org
2. ikmtrust[.]com
3. lxwo[.]org
4. sysanalyticweb[.]com (Figure 3 & Figure 4)
Researchers from Jigsaw Security, based on leads from Talos in late 2017, traced the
domains elaxo[.]org and ikmtrust[.]com and the tool Sedupload, to a Fancy Bear operation.
The domain lxwo[.]org appeared in a blog post from Threat Intel Recon that resolved to an IP
address within a document attributed to Fancy Bear. The rogue Lojack samples containing
the sysanalyticweb[.]com domains were only recently spotted in the wild (April 2018).
Despite the hijack of this software being a publicly known tactic, there are many similarities in
the binary comparisons (above) and infrastructure analysis (below) that increase the
probability it is the same actor(s):
All the listed domains are associated with the same Lojack agent utilizing the same
compile time.
The domains in question all contain nonsensical Registrant information where the actor
tends to copy/paste the same information in multiple fields.
Each domain includes a Registrant Name (often a nonsensical word), but additionally
includes a similar word in the Registrant Organization field.
This is interesting because that is a field that is often skipped when a Registrant
Name is present, but this actor(s) regularly utilizes both fields

Conclusion & Recommendations
7/8

Hijacking legitimate software is a common enough tactic for malicious actors. A key factor
making this activity so devious is the malicious Lojack samples were simply labeled "unsafe”,
"suspicious", or "DangerousObject", rather than malware. As a result, rogue Lojack samples
could fly under the radar and give attackers a stealthy backdoor into victim systems. ASERT
recommends scanning for rogue Lojack agents using the Yara signature listed in the
Appendix (below) and blocking the domains contained within this blog.
