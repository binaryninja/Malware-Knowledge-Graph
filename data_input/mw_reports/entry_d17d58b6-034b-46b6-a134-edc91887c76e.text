New 'pymafka' malicious package drops Cobalt Strike on
macOS, Windows, Linux
blog.sonatype.com/new-pymafka-malicious-package-drops-cobalt-strike-on-macos-windows-linux

This week, Sonatype's automated malware detection bots have discovered malicious Python
package 'pymafka' in the PyPI registry.
The package appears to typosquat a legitimate popular library PyKafka, a programmerfriendly Apache Kafka client for Python. The development follows our discovery of another
typosquat targeting the Apache Kafka project from earlier this month.
1/7

PyKafka includes Python implementations of Kafka producers and consumers, and has been
retrieved over 4,240,305 times by user-initiated downloads and mirrors/bots alike. By
contrast, malicious 'pymafka' shows a download count of around 300 as Sonatype timely
reported the finding to PyPI.

PyMafka drops Cobalt Strike on Windows, macOS
On May 17th, a mysterious 'pymafka' package appeared on the PyPI registry. The package
was shortly flagged by the Sonatype Nexus platform's automated malware detection
capabilities.
The package, 'pymafka' may sound identical to the popular PyKafka, but its insides reveal a
different story.

The 'setup.py' Python script inside 'pymafka' first detects your platform. Depending on
whether you are running Windows, macOS, or Linux, an appropriate malicious trojan is
downloaded and executed on the infected system.
The trojan in question is a Cobalt Strike (CS) beacon. Cobalt Strike is a pen-testing software
tool typically used by red teams and ethical hackers for simulating real-world cyberattacks,
especially during security assessments.
But, time and time again attackers, including ransomware groups like LockBit, have abused
Cobalt Strike to infect victims.

Interestingly, as evident from the code below, on Windows systems, the Python script
attempts to drop the Cobalt Strike beacon at 'C:\Users\Public\iexplorer.exe'. Note, this
misspelling stands out as the legitimate Microsoft Internet Explorer process is typically called
"iexplore.exe" (no 'r' at the end) and isn't present in the C:\Users\Public directory.

The malicious executables being downloaded are 'win.exe' [VirusTotal], and 'MacOS'
[VirusTotal], with their names corresponding to their target operating systems. Both of these
are downloaded from the IP address 141.164.58[.]147, commissioned by the cloud hosting
provider, Vultr.
These executables attempt to contact China-based IP 39.106.227[.]92, which is assigned to
Alisoft (Alibaba).
Less than a third of antivirus engines detected the samples as malicious at the time of our
submission to VirusTotal, although that's still a better detection rate than zero-detections
seen in some of our earlier discoveries.

3/7

On Windows, we observed the payload also kept persistently surveying the '/updates.rss'
endpoint and sending encrypted cookie values in requests, a behavior consistent with Cobalt
Strike beacons.
GET /updates.rss HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Cookie: mZoD7LYrA/...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows Phone OS 7.5; Trident/5.0;
IEMobile/9.0; LG; LG-E906)Host: 39.106.227.92:8445
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cache-Control: no-cache
For Linux systems, the Python script attempts to download and run an "env" executable from
the IP address 39.107.154[.]72 (also Alibaba-owned), which at the time of analysis was
down.
We reported these findings to the PyPI registry shortly after catching and analyzing the
package and the malicious package was taken down yesterday, just before reaching ~300
downloads.

Nexus Firewall users remain protected
It's been a busy start to the month already.
Due to the heavy influx of malicious packages lately, we have launched This Week in
Malware digests, published every Friday, and delivered automatically to blog subscribers.
Earlier this month, Sonatype reported attackers typosquatting the popular npm library
'colors', and not for the first time either. Last week, we came across even more 'colors'
typosquats and a malicious Rust package 'rustdecimal' that uses elusive XOR encryption to
drop malware.
We further analyzed a different Apache Kafka typosquat and reported several dependency
confusion packages to both npm and PyPI registries, thereby keeping the open source
community and our customers safe.
And as predicted, the attacks on open source registries are continuing to surge as the
cybersecurity community from across the world is focused on battling the ongoing
international crisis.
Between March & April, we reported on a sharp uptick in open source attacks after
discovering a 'fix-crash' info-stealer and 500+ malicious npm packages. That was on top of
the 400+ packages targeting Azure, Airbnb, and Uber developers discovered recently.
Users of Nexus Firewall can rest easy knowing that such malicious packages would
automatically be blocked from reaching their development builds.

Nexus Firewall instances will automatically quarantine any suspicious components detected
by our automated malware detection bots while a manual review by a researcher is in the
works, thereby keeping your software supply chain protected from the start.
Sonatypeâ€™s world-class security research data, combined with our automated malware
detection technology safeguards your developers, customers, and software supply chain
from infections.
