TIN WOODLAWN used a customized version of Cobalt Strike to evade configuration-based
detections, but a combination of strategic and tactical countermeasures identifies the activity.

During a focused investigation into malicious use of the legitimate Cobalt Strike penetration
testing tool, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers explored how
government-sponsored threat groups leverage it during intrusions. These groups use various
tactics to operate with stealth.
Secureworks incident responders observed the TIN WOODLAWN cyberespionage group
using a modified version of Cobalt Strike to evade countermeasures that rely on the default
configuration for detection. CTU™ research indicates that this group is likely operated or
tasked by the Vietnamese government to steal intellectual property and trade secrets. The
threat actors have also targeted individuals deemed to be of interest to the Vietnamese
government, including journalists and political opponents.
TIN WOODLAWN uses Cobalt Strike extensively during intrusions, often delivering it via
spearphishing emails containing malicious document attachments. These documents include
macro code that registers a scheduled task. This scheduled task uses the Windows mshta
utility to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon PowerShell stager that executes in memory. This
method avoids writing a portable executable to disk, making in-memory detection the only
way to identify this phase of the intrusion.
CTU researchers observed TIN WOODLAWN deploying a custom stager that created a
named pipe, using a command-line parameter as the pipe name. CTU researchers dubbed
this stager 'CommaChameleon' because it uses the '-comma' PowerShell command-line
switch. This switch is short for the '-command' switch string, which indicates that a
PowerShell command follows. As of this publication, TIN WOODLAWN is the only threat
group known to use the shortened command-line switch and a randomized uppercase and
lowercase spelling (e.g., POWersHEll -cOmmA).
The stager waits for an RC4-encrypted executable payload to be written to the named pipe
and then injects the payload into a legitimate Windows executable randomly selected from a
hard-coded list in the stager code. In one campaign, Cobalt Strike injected the Windows
esentutl.exe Extensible Storage Engine utility with an RC4-encrypted Mimikatz credential
harvesting payload for credential theft.
Cobalt Strike can offer a threat actor anonymity because it is so widely used. Custom
implementations may indicate activity by a sophisticated threat actor trying to evade security
controls. In this incident, TIN WOODLAWN's custom stager evaded detections for generic
Cobalt Strike stagers, downloaded and executed a secondary payload in-memory to
minimize host artifacts, and injected an encrypted portable executable into a Windows utility
process instead of leveraging the standard Cobalt Strike shellcode.

Table 1. MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by TIN WOODLAWN.
Direct observation of TIN WOODLAWN's techniques allowed CTU researchers to combine
strategic countermeasures that detect generic behaviors with tactical countermeasures that
identify customized activity. The resulting detections indicated this was targeted activity by a
targeted government-sponsored threat actor rather than the work of an opportunistic
cybercriminal. By integrating these countermeasures into the Secureworks Taegis™ XDR
platform, CTU researchers and network defenders can identify attempts by governmentsponsored threat actors to weaponize Cobalt Strike in targeted environments. Preview
