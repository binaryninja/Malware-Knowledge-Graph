The attackers behind the Sodinokibi Ransomware are applying pressure on Travelex to pay
a multi-million dollar ransom by stating they will release or sell stolen data that allegedly
contains customer's personal information.
In a New Year's Eve ransomware attack on Travelex, the Sodinokibi Ransomware operators
allegedly stole 5GB of unencrypted files and then proceeded to encrypt the foreign currency
exchange company's entire network.
In a conversation with BleepingComputer, the Sodinokibi Ransomware actors state that
they were demanding a $3 million ransom or they would release the data containing "DOB
SSN CC and other". This amount was later changed to $6 million.
In a statement by Travelex, the currency exchange company is stating that there is no
evidence that any data was stolen.
"Whilst the investigation is still ongoing, Travelex has confirmed that the software virus is
ransomware known as Sodinokibi, also commonly referred to as REvil. Travelex has
proactively taken steps to contain the spread of the ransomware, which has been
successful. To date, the company can confirm that whilst there has been some data

encryption, there is no evidence that structured personal customer data has been
encrypted. Whist Travelex does not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has
been encrypted, there is still no evidence to date that any data has been exfiltrated."
The Sodinokibi actors, though, paint a different picture.
When told that Travelex was denying any data was stolen, they told BleepingComputer that
they were currently negotiating the ransom price with Travelex and that they would benefit
even if a ransom is not paid.
"If this were true, they would not bargain with us now. On the other hand, we do not care.
We will still benefit if they do not pay. Just the damage to them will be more serious."
When we were told this, it was not 100% clear how the ransomware operators would
benefit.
This became clear in a recent forum post to a Russian hacker and malware forum where
the public representative for the REvil/Sodinokibi Ransomware stated that if Travelex does
not pay the ransom, they will sell the stolen PII information of their customers to other
attackers.

Sodinokibi post to a Russian hacker forum
This post translated to English as:
There are no seats. And not planned. Travelex recommend starting to raise funds for
payment, or DOB + SSN + CC will be sold to anyone.

The statement "There are not seats." in Unknown's post means that REvil is not accepting
any new affiliates at this time.
The user named 'Unknown' is the public-facing representative of
the Sodinokibi Ransomware and has made forum posts in the past when the ransomware
first launched and they began building a team of affiliates composed of veteran malware
distributors.

2/5

Ransomware operators have been threatening to release stolen data for some time, but
none carried out their threats until the Maze Ransomware group released the stolen data of
Allied Universal.
Since then, Unknown has also stated that Sodinokibi Ransomware will adopt the tactic of
releasing stolen data as leverage to get victims to pay.

Unknown's post about releasing stolen data
To this date, Sodinokibi has not released any stolen data and it is not known for sure if they
will release Travelex's if the ransom is not paid.
However, if the data is released, it will open up a whole new world of business problems for
Travelex
The Sodinokibi actors are right, too. No matter what happens, Travelex will incur further
damage; either through the payment of a ransom, the public release of their data, or by the
data being sold to other threat actors.
If the data is released, the attack will need to be classified as a data breach, notifications
and free monitoring services will need to be offered, GDPR fines would be likely as are the
risks of class action lawsuits.
BleepingComputer has contacted Travelex with questions regarding this story, but has not
heard back.

Transparency in ransomware attacks is necessary

3/5

When an organization suffers a ransomware attack, they usually try to hide the attack or
downplay its impact to prevent customer concerns, damage to brand image, and a plunging
stock price.
This commonly, though, backfires as the severity of the attacks ultimately leak and make
the company look worse than if they had been transparent about it in the first place.
Now that many ransomware attackers are claiming to steal data before encrypting devices,
it is more important than ever to be transparent about these attacks as they could now be
classified as data breaches.
By hiding this information, companies are more likely to be hit with government fines and
lawsuits as customers' personal information is compromised.
Instead, companies should follow Norsk Hydro's lead and be fully transparent during a
ransomware attack by providing timely updates, customer notifications, and public
information.
This approach not only made Norsk Hydro customers feel better but also increased their
brand image.
