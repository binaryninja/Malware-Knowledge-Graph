How was Search.searchetan.com set in Google Chrome?
Search.searchetan.com is configured by the Easy Television Access Now extension. This
extension is promoted through adware programs that display pop-up advertisements. One of
the advertisements that is displayed is for the Easy Television Access Now extension.
If Chrome's new tab page is configured to use Easy Television Access Now and you do not
find it useful, you can remove the extension from Chrome. As this extension is commonly
advertised by adware, you may want to use the removal guide below to scan for and remove
unwanted programs for free as well.

To terminate any programs that may interfere with the removal process we must first

please download RKill to your desktop from the following link.

of RKill from the rkill download page. All of the files are renamed copies of RKill, which you
can try instead. Please note that the download page will open in a new browser window or
tab.
Do not reboot your computer after running RKill as the malware programs will start
