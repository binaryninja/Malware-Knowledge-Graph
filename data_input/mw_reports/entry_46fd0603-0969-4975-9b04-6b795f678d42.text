On June 10, 2020, FortiGuard Labs came across a global malicious spam campaign that is
targeting users who may be sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement that began in
the United States. With all of the calamity of 2020, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
and the numerous protests in the United States and elsewhere, attackers are leveraging the
global news cycle to lure unsuspecting victims to download and open malicious
attachments.
The campaign uses a variety of subject lines for emails with an attached malicious Microsoft
Word document to compel the user into opening the attachment. The content of the body is
written in haste and uses poor grammar, but the Black Lives Matter subject is used to compel

victims into opening the attachment:

Claim in attached file
These emails utilize variations in subjects and sender names to either circumvent spam
filters or to simply create confusion. An example of the variety of subjects and senders being
used is shown below:

Technical Details of the Malicious Spam Campaign Using Black Lives
Matter to Lure Victims
The attachment is a standard Microsoft Word document with a generic image enticing the
user to enable macros.
Figure 2. Image in Word Document Compelling User to Enable Macros.
When we try to examine the macro, we find that it is protected by a password, as is the case
with many malicious documents. This adds an additional layer of protection to prevent casual
analysis. And after extracting the macro, we also see that an obfuscated string is used to
hide the payload.
Figure 3. Obfuscation to hide payload
Once it goes through the deobfuscation process, we can see that it is using injection to
deliver its malicious payload. In this case, it is loading the stage 1 downloader.
Figure 4. Thread created after call to VirtualProtectEx that contains the injection instruction to
download and execute Trickbot
Once a memory region is created by the call to VirtualProtectEx, a thread is created and
executed. This new thread contains the actual payload to execute assembly instructions in
memory. It then unpacks itself and proceeds to contact C2 servers in order to download and
execute Trickbot.
The campaign utilizes that same strategy as previous Trickbot attacks. The individuals
behind Trickbot have used trending topics before to lure victims and extend their installed
base. The campaign just prior to the current one leveraging the Black Lives Matter
movement in the United States, was focused on COVID-19, which we previously analyzed.
Performing OSINT research, it appears that the command and control servers used by the
actors behind this latest campaign have also compromised two specific sites, a city
government website based in South East Asia using the Joomla CMS, and a manufacturer in
the United States that is using WordPress as its CMS.

At the time of discovery, FortiGuard Labs was one of a handful of vendors who had detected
the sample used in this analysis:

Global Spread
Analyzing the domains and infrastructure used by the threat actors, we find that they are all
hosted in the Czech Republic (CD-Telematika a.s.). While this does not mean anything in
terms of attribution, it is still interesting that this is the ISP chosen by the actors behind this
latest Trickbot campaign. Scouring our passive DNS records has revealed nothing in terms
of past campaigns originating from the identified servers, which is increasingly the case
given the reality of easy-to-spin-up virtual private servers and on-demand cloud
infrastructures.
We can also see that a spike developed quite noticeably on the day this was discovered
(June 10th). This is true for all domains related to this specific campaign:

While the US and Canada are its primary targets, we have detected variations of this
campaign affecting other countries as well. Here is a brief breakdown of what we have
discovered.
Name: mnjcszrh.monster
Address: 82.202.65.177
Figure 7: Domain Name - mnjcszrh.monster
Based on our telemetry, the top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign are Canada
(48%) and the United States (46%), with France, Cyprus, and Italy having seen activity
averaging less than one percent.
Name: shmbidgp.monster

The top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign are Canada (48%) and the United
States (46%). This time, France, Thailand, and Cyprus have seen less than 1% of activity.
Name: ygzggxeh.monster
Address: 82.202.65.125
Figure 9: Domain Name - ygzggxeh.monster
We can now see a pattern developing. The top countries targeted by this specific campaign
are again, the United States (46%) and Canada (45%), this time with Italy, Cyprus, and
Oman averaging less than one percent of activity. While the US and Canada are clearly the
primary targets, Cyprus is consistently included in the spillover.
Name: vmrriktf.monster
Address: 89.203.251.79
Figure 10: Domain Name - vmrriktf.monster
Interestingly, based on our telemetry, there were only 4 countries targeted by this specific
campaign. And other than the usual targets of the United States (49%) and Canada (48%),
the other countries impacted this time are Rwanda and United Kingdom, averaging less than
one percent of activity.
Name: copsbiau.monster
Address: 89.203.248.175
Figure 11: Domain Name - copsbiau.monster
Finally, our telemetry shows that the top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign again
include the United States (61%) and Canada (36%), and with Italy and Cyprus again
showing up, but this time with Germany included. These three countries have also seen
activity averaging less than one percent.

Mitigation of the Malicious Spam Campaign
FortiGuard Labs recommends that all AV and IPS definitions are kept up to date on a
continual basis, and that organizations maintain a proactive patching routine when vendor
updates are available. If it is deemed that patching is not feasible, it is recommended that
IPS be used for proximity control, also known as virtual patching, and that a risk assessment
is conducted to determine additional mitigation safeguards within an environment.

In the meantime, organizations are strongly encouraged to conduct ongoing training
sessions to educate and inform personnel about the latest phishing/spearphishing attacks.
They also need to encourage their employees to never open attachments from someone
they don’t know, and to always treat emails from unrecognized/untrusted senders with
caution.
Initial Access Mitigation: FortiMail or other secure mail gateway solutions can be used to
block specific file types such as the ones outlined in this blog. FortiMail can also be
configured to send attachments to our FortiSandbox solution (ATP), either on-premises or in
the cloud, to determine if a file displays malicious behavior. FortiGate firewalls with anti-virus
enabled, combined with a valid subscription, are able detect and block this threat if properly
configured.
Execution: Since it has been reported that this threat has been delivered via social
engineering distribution mechanisms, it is crucial that end users within an organization are
made aware of the various types of attacks being delivered using this method. This can be
accomplished through regular training sessions and impromptu tests using predetermined
templates by internal security departments within an organization. Simple user awareness
training on how to spot emails with malicious attachments or links could stop initial access
into the network.
Fortinet Solutions: If user awareness training fails and a user opens a malicious
attachment or link, FortiEDR is able to prevent TrickBot from executing. FortiClientrunning
the latest up-to-date virus signatures will also detect and block this file and associated
files.The file(s) highlighted in our report are currently being detected with the current
definition:
78.072 (Added Jun 10, 2020)
Exfiltration and C&C: A FortiGate located at each of your ingress and egress points with its
Web Filtering service enabled, and with up-to-date definitions and/or Botnet Security enabled
will detect and block any observable outbound connections if configured correctly.
Web Filtering: All network IOCs in this report have been placed on the block list by the
FortiGuard Web Filtering service.
Malicious Word Document Protection: FortiGuard CDR (Content Disarm &
Reconstruction) supported by FortiMail and FortiGate, processes all incoming files,
deconstructs them, and then strips all active content from those files in real-time to create a
flat, sanitized file. CDR fortifies zero-day file protection strategies by proactively removing
any possibility of malicious content in your files.
Other Fortinet Safeguards: It is important to note that as attacks continue to become more
sophisticated they can sometimes circumvent your security defenses. This is why it is
important to ensure that, in addition to a layered security strategy, you also have the ability to
5/9

detect anomalous activity that could be malicious.
In addition, our Enterprise Bundle addresses this and similar attacks. The Enterprise Bundle
consolidates all the cybersecurity services you need to protect and defend against all
cyberattack channels, from the endpoint to the cloud, including IoT devices, providing you
