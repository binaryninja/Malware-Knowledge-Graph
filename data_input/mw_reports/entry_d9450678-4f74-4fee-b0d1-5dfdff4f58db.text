[CB19] Cyber Threat Landscape in Japan – Revealing Threat in the
Shadow by Chi En Shen (Ashley) Oleg Bondarenko

Share
Presentations & Public Speaking
For the past few years, Asia Pacific and Japan have continued to be a regular target of cyber
threat actors. From 2018 to 2019, we have observed several threats targeting Japan
involving cyber espionage and underground activities. Some of the adversaries and
campaigns are revealed in OSINT, however, some are still lurking in shadow.
In this talk, we will reveal the TTP's (tactics, techniques and procedures) of espionage threat
actors interested in Japanese electronics, chemical and 5G equipment manufacturing
companies. One campaign leverages a malware attributed to APT41, a prolific Chinese
cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with
financially motivated operations. Beside the Chinese actors, we have also observed a group
which historically focused on the EMEA region shift to showing interest in Japan. In addition,
we will also disclose details of underground activity involving a target in the Japanese
financial industry.

7. 7. ©2019 FireEye | Private & Confidential 7 Top 10 Malware Families. Emotet. ▶
Emotet is a modular credential theft Trojan that primarily collects usernames and
passwords for accounts at financial institutions. The malware downloads and executes
various modules from hard-coded C&C servers. The modules are not written to disk but
loaded directly from memory and include web browser and email client credential
harvesters, an email scraper for Microsoft Outlook, and a spam engine. FireEye
iSIGHT Intelligence researchers have recently identified newer variants of the Emotet
malware that contain a self-propagation module and other notable host- and networkbased indicator changes.

collects usernames and passwords for accounts at financial institutions; ▶ downloads
and executes various modules from hard-coded C2s; ▶ loaded directly from memory;
▶ include Web browser and email client credential harvesters, an email scraper for
Microsoft Outlook, and a spam engine; ▶ Secondary Payloads in 2018 - Trickbot,
IcedID, and ZeusPanda;

LokiBot is a .NET launcher that executes an embedded credential stealer. It can
download and then drop, load, or execute other binaries to the system. It is also
designed to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that information
to a C&C host via HTTP POST. The compromised data includes stored passwords,
login credential information from web browsers, FTP/SSH, email, poker clients, and a
variety of cryptocurrency wallets. It is designed to work on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and
has a Linux option.

FormBook is a data stealer/form grabber that has been advertised on HackForums by
its developer "Ng. Coder" since early 2016. The malware injects itself into various
processes and installs function hooks to log keystrokes, steal clipboard contents, and
extract data from HTTP sessions. The malware can also execute commands from a
C&C server. The commands include instructing the malware to download and execute
files, start processes, shut down and reboot the system, and steal cookies and local
passwords. It also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path,
filename, file extension, and the registry key used for persistence.

70. 70. ©2019 FireEye Conclusion 70 § Espionage actors from various countries still
having a lot interests in targeting Japan. § With the improving dwell time, actor are
devoting extra effort on bypassing detection products. § Organizations should consider
thread hijacking as a possible attack vector in their red/blue/purple team scenarios. §
We see actor shows increasing interests in chemical, 5G technology, manufacturing
and energy sectors. § International events such as the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the
2020 Tokyo Olympics / Paralympics will continue to attract attack groups to Japan. §
The threat hunting and monitoring should not overlook the underground forums aspect.
