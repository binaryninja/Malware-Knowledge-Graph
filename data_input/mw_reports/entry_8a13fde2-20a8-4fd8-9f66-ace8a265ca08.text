Ransomware attack is growing at an alarming rate thanks to Ransomware as a Service
(RaaS) operations. Read this blog and learn what is RaaS and how the threat actors operate
these attacks to help you understand why ransomware attribution is an industry problem, and
the preemptive measures you need to take to protect your organization.

Introduction
We, as an industry, are continuously tracking how ransomware groups attack, and who the
newest victims are. We do this by monitoring their leak sites, documenting the way they
perform the attacks (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures – aka TTPs), and analyzing their
toolsets. However, we sometimes forget to look at how all these groups work behind the
scenes, what kind of resources they use before and after an attack, from affiliate services to
“client support” platforms.
During the recent Rootedcon conference in Spain, we delivered a talk about this subject, and
this blog post serves as a commentary of the insights presented about Ransomware as a
Service (RaaS): how it really works; how the threat actors operate these attacks; and how
organizations can analyze the attacks and take preemptive measures in the event of future
attacks.

We also took a deep dive into the activities of a particularly nefarious RaaS group called Hive
(sometimes known as The Hive Gang); the in depth report will be published shortly so watch
this space.

Targeted ransomware
As we mentioned in the history of ransomware blog post, the ransomware ecosystem has
evolved enormously in the past years. Operating a banking botnet used to be the most
popular way to get rich in the cybercriminal world, until CryptoLocker was taken down in
2014 and Slavik’s earnings were published. Cybercriminals realized ransomware was a
profitable business, and so the ransomware boom began.
Since then, threat actors have been adapting their toolset, techniques, and underground
services offering to better support and launch targeted ransomware attacks. Advanced
attackers methodically penetrate corporate networks and move laterally to study the
system(s). The malware is then deployed in a calculated manner designed to cause the
biggest obstruction to business operations possible thereby maximising the chances of being
paid.
With this in mind, the targets of ransomware operations have adjusted and are no longer
domestic users but big corporations who can pay substantially higher amounts in ransom.
This change started with a few ransomware families like BitPaymer back in 2017, but
targeted ransomware is widespread today.

Advanced attackers would often use their own unique ransomware families. However, this
lead to perpetrators being easily attributed as the source. In 2019, the FBI announced
sanctions against Evil Corp, a Russia based group, after it was identified as the culprit of the
extensive use of DRIDEX-based malware attacks.

In a bid to better cover their tracks and avoid further sanctions, the group tried a new
strategy: continuously using different malware families. This included BitPaymer,
WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix Locker, PayloadBIN and Macaw Locker malwares.
Mandiant recently uncovered multiple Lockbit intrusions, an RaaS offering, which they
connected with Evil Corp. While this is uncharacteristic of the group, it highlights another
potential shift in strategy for the group as an attempt to distance themselves further from the
risk of sanction.
Excluding Evil Corp, the majority of threat actors performing targeted attacks today make use
of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) offerings to get their hands on the ransomware binary.
RaaS is now by far the most popular business model, allowing cybercriminals to swiftly set
up their attack operations.

Ransomware as a Service
Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) is a more specialized version of the old Malware as a
Service (MaaS) model, where a provider supplies a client with the malware binary, access to
the backend to manage the botnet, and, in some cases, other additional services. When
talking about RaaS the only difference is that the provided malware is exclusively a
ransomware family.
There are different actors involved in the RaaS model, as can be seen in the following
graphic:

Administrators
(Image 2 in orange)
The Administrators provide the affiliates with access to the malware, the infrastructure and
sometimes even support in negotiations with the victims. Depending on the group, the
infrastructure might be different, but it might include a leak site where victim information can
be published, an affiliate portal where the affiliate will manage victims and generate malware
binaries, the victim portal where victims will access to communicate with the cybercriminals,
and, sometimes, even some internal servers for internal communication (internal IM, for
instance).

4/8

The Administrators will get a cut from the affiliates’ operations (80-20 is quite common), but
they will not attack directly any victims.

Sellers
(Image 2 in blue)
If the RaaS offering is private, negotiations will be handled through private messages in
forums or IM chats, and only accessible to certain cybercriminals with a particular reputation.
The rest of RaaS offerings need to be advertised to potential “clients” and this is where the
sellers and resellers are
useful. Those actors will be in charge of managing the sales side of the operation and
obtaining new affiliates, and this will be achieved advertising the RaaS in underground
forums.
In this context, it is important to highlight that ransomware conversations were banned from
popular underground forums, like Exploit or XSS, in May 2021. This was mainly due to
political/law enforcement pressure into ransomware operators and the fear of a shutdown of
the forums. Other reasons were more philosophical. For instance, the administrator of XSS
argued that the RaaS model is hurting the innovation in the cybercriminal community and
that this was a good reason for the ban too.

As it is normal in the underground ecosystem, when a service or forum disappears a new
one appears the next day. This is what happened with the ban of ransomware conversations.
In July 2021 a new forum called RAMP appeared where ransomware offering
advertisements were more than welcome.

Affiliates

The affiliates are the real attackers in a targeted ransomware operation. They will manage to
get access to the targeted organization, by their own means or using Initial Access Brokers,
and deploy the ransomware provided by the RaaS. They need to have enough experience to
move laterally between systems, avoid detections, exfiltrate stolen information and deploy
the ransomware in several systems at the same time.
Depending on the RaaS program, the affiliates will need to register their victims, including
information about the victim and the operation, upload the stolen information to the leak site
and communicate with the victims.

Initial Access Brokers
(Image 2 in black)
Initial Access Brokers (IABs) are financially motivated threat actors that profit through the
sale of remote access to corporate networks in underground forums, like Exploit, or XSS.
The types of access tools offered are mostly Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Virtual Private
Network (VPN), web shells, and remote access software tools offered by companies such
Citrix, Pulse Secure, Zoho, or
VMware. However, threat actors are also selling information and tools to perform intrusions
into companies through SQL injections, remote code execution (RCE) exploits, and other
vulnerabilities.

Read more on how ransomware groups use IABs
Affiliates of RaaS offerings might use IABs services in order to facilitate and streamline the
targeted ransomware operations, so they just need to focus on the intrusion, as the initial
access and the malware were already given to them. IAB advertisements detail the industry

sector, location and revenue of the targets so affiliates can easily choose among them.

Victims
(Image 2 in green)
No person or organization wants to be the target of any malware attack, but of course they
do not get a choice, they are a critical part of it. Without these victims, or “clients” as the
ransomware operators call them, this business model would not work. The RaaS model
exists because victims pay: there is no other option for them if they want a chance of
surviving the attack. And for some companies, even if they pay, they are not guaranteed
access to their systems and data. Regardless if they get access back or not, they are still at
significant risk of bankruptcy. It’s not just the cost of the ransom, consider additional
damages like the cost of downtime, business reputation and more.

RaaS and attribution problems
Threat attribution is crucial. Digging into the exact who, what, where, when and how of the
attack provides valuable insights to better prevent attacks in the future.
As we have laid out above, different actors have different parts to play in the RaaS model.
The nature of this business model, where actions are spread across different and separate
actors, makes
life much more difficult for analysts and researchers who try to accurately put the pieces of
the attack together and tie it to a group. Of course, we can attribute Indicators of
Compromise (IOCs) and TTPs to the RaaS offering itself, as most of us do, but we should
probably not call that accurate attribution.
In most of the cases, RaaS administrators will not attack victims directly, they will provide
affiliates with the needed elements to perform the targeted attack. Meaning that the
attribution should point to the affiliate and not to the RaaS provider.
However, an affiliate might have used the help of an IAB to access the targeted organization.
This means that the IAB has probably scanned the organization looking for security
weaknesses and maybe even exploiting a specific vulnerability. In this case, this
scanning/exploiting activity should be attributed to the IAB, but not to the affiliate.
Let’s break down this example flow of an attack:
Actor A breaches the company and sells access to Actor B, an affiliate of Lockbit

7/8

Actor B requests a new payload to deploy and infect the company with ransomware
The company contacts Lockbit about the infection
Lockbit provides support and oversees the transaction
Some questions that will need answered:
Given the IoCs that were retrieves from the infection, which belong to whom?
Is the IP shown in the firewall logs to be associated with Actor A or Actor B?
Does the payload belong to Lockbit or Actor B?
Ideally, an analyst wants to be able to differentiate between all these behaviors and IOCs,
and correctly assign them to the corresponding actor.
Attribution of ransomware attacks is extremely tricky because we don’t have enough
information to accurately trace all the elements of an attack, tending to connect all indicators
and attacking behavior to the RaaS itself, causing probably even more confusion for future
analysis.

Conclusions
Knowing your enemy is key to effectively organize your defenses. Targeted ransomware
operations are here to stay and they will continue threatening businesses indiscriminately.
Understanding how these groups operate behind the scenes, how the RaaS model works
with its different actors, and how they negotiate is information that every potential
ransomware target should be aware of. Threat intelligence services and insights are crucial
to know more about the attackers that might target an organization in the future, helping to
mitigate as much as possible the impact of an attack.
The RaaS model makes even harder the attribution of attacks, as IOCs and TTPs can be
attributed to the wrong actors in the RaaS scheme. There is no vendor with 100% of visibility
into threats, and that’s why industry collaboration is extremely important to fill the gaps and
win together the fight against ransomware.
