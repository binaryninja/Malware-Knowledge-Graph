The ASEC analysis team has once again discovered the distribution of LockBit ransomware
using phishing e-mail, and disguising itself as copyright claims e-mail which was introduced
in the previous blog. The filename of the attachment in e-mail had password included, which
is similar to that of phishing e-mail distributed last February (see the link below).

As shown in Figure 2, the phishing e-mail has a compressed file as an attachment that
contains another compressed file inside.

Upon decompressing the file in the compressed file, an executable disguised using a PDF
file icon is found.

As shown in Figure 4, this file is confirmed to be a NSIS File. Looking into the nsi script
detail, it decodes the data file ‘162809383’ and performs malicious behaviors through
recursions and injections.

This ransomware prevents recovery by deleting volume shadow copy. Furthermore, to make
sure the ransomware runs continuously, it registers Run Key to registry and drops
LockBit_Ransomware.hta on the desktop to keep it running even after a desktop change or a
reboot.

The encryption happens after certain services and processes are terminated. If the drive type
is DRIVE_REMOVABLE, DRIVE_FIXED, or DRIVE_RAMDISK, it will also be encrypted.
Extensions and name of folders or files that are excluded from encryption are as follows:
system volume information, windows photo viewer, windowspowershell, internet explorer,
windows security, windows defender, $recycle.bin, Mozilla, msbuild, appdata, windows and
etc.
Table 4. Folders excluded from encryption
.mp4 .mp3 .reg .ini .idx .cur .drv .sys .ico .lnk .dll .exe .lock .lockbit .sqlite .accdb .lzma
.zipx .7z .db and etc.
Table 5. Extensions excluded from encryption
Encrypted files have an extension named .lockbit and a certain icon. Also, a ransom note
named ‘Restore-My-Files.txt’ is created in the encrypted folder.

Figure 8. When infected by ransomware
As shown above, the distribution of ransomware disguised as copyright-related claims has
been continually done in the past. Because emails distributing such malware types may
include names of actual illustrators, users may run attached files without realizing it. Hence
they should take extreme caution.
