Home appliances giant Whirlpool suffered a ransomware attack by the Nefilim ransomware
gang who stole data before encrypting devices.
Whirlpool is one of the world's largest home application makers with appliances under its
name and KitchenAid, Maytag, Brastemp, Consul, Hotpoint, Indesit, and Bauknecht.
Whirlpool employs 77,000 people at 59 manufacturing & technology research centers
worldwide and generated approximately $20 billion in revenue for 2019.
Over the weekend, the Nefilim ransomware gang published files stolen from Whirlpool
during a ransomware attack. The leaked data included documents related to employee
benefits, accommodation requests, medical information requests, background checks, and
more.

In a statement to BleepingComputer, Whirlpool confirmed the attack and that their systems
have been fully restored from the attack.
"We live in a time when Illegal cyber crimes are all too prevalent across every industry. Data
privacy is a top priority at Whirlpool Corporation and we invest in the technology and
processes to help protect our people, our data and our operations."
"Last month Whirlpool Corporation discovered ransomware in our environment. The
malware was detected and contained quickly. We are unaware of any consumer information
that was exposed. There is no operational impact at this time," Whirlpool Corporation told
BleepingComputer in an email.
Nefilim is not a particularly active ransomware operation but is known for attacks on other
large and well-known victims in the past.
Other victims attacked by Nefilim include Orange S.A., Dussman Group, Luxottica, and Toll
Group.
Updae 12/28/20: Whirlpool's systems are fully restored, not slowly recovering as initially
stated.
