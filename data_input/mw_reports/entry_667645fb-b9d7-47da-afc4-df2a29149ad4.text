TikTok Spyware
zscaler.com/blogs/research/tiktok-spyware

A recent threat to ban TikTok in the United States has taken the internet by storm and
received mixed reactions from social media and internet users. U.S. President Donald
Trump has ordered ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to sell its U.S. TikTok assets
and also issued executive orders that would ban the social media apps TikTok and WeChat
from operating in the U.S. if the sale doesn’t happen in the next few weeks. On the other
side, ByteDance has filed a lawsuit suing the Trump administration.
When popular applications come under fire and are featured prominently in the news,
hackers get excited as these newsworthy apps can become their latest target. And TikTok is
no exception.

Generally, after an application gets banned from an official app store, such as Google Play,
users try to find alternative ways to download the app. In doing so, users can become
victims to malicious apps portraying themselves as the original app. Recently there was a
huge wave of SMS messages, as well as Whatsapp messages, making the rounds asking
users to download the latest version of TikTok at hxxp://tiny[.]cc/TiktokPro. In reality, this
downloaded app is a fake app that asks for credentials and Android permissions (including
camera and phone permissions), resulting in the user being bombarded with
advertisements.
Recently, we have come across another variant of this app portraying itself as TikTok Pro,
but this is a full-fledged spyware with premium features to spy on victim with ease. (Please
note this is a different app and not the same as the one being spread by
hxxp://tiny[.]cc/TiktokPro.)

Technical Analysis
App Name :

TikTok Pro

Hash :

9fed52ee7312e217bd10d6a156c8b988

Package Name :

com.example.dat.a8andoserverx

Upon installation, the spyware portrays itself as TikTok using the name TikTok Pro. As soon
as a user tries to open the app, it launches a fake notification and soon the notification as
well as the app icon disappears. This fake notification tactic is used to redirect the user's
attention, meanwhile the app hides itself, making the user believe the app to be faulty.
This functionality can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1: App icon and fake notification.
Behind the scenes, there are number of process occurring simultaneously. First, an activity
named MainActivity fires up, taking care of hiding the icon and showing the fake notification.
It also starts an Android service named MainService.
The spyware also appears to have an additional payload stored under the /res/raw/
directory. This is a common technique used by malware developers to bundle the main
payload inside the Android package to avoid easy detection. As seen in Figure 2, the app
tries to open the payload from the /res/raw/ directory and generate an additional Android
Package Kit (APK) named .app.apk :

Figure 2 : The decoy code for the fake TikTok.

Upon analysis, we discovered that this is a decoy functionality and no new payload is
generated. The conditions to build an additional payload are never met. Going one step
further, we rebuilt the malware to execute the apparent functionality of generating a
payload, but discovered that the APK stored in the /res/raw/ directory is empty. The
placement of the decoy functionality is likely designed to confuse the malware researchers.
It is also possible that this functionality is under development, making this
placeholder code incomplete.
Coming back to the execution flow, once the spyware hides itself, it starts an Android
service named MainService. Android services are components that can be made to execute
independently in the background without the victim's knowledge. MainService is the brain of
this spyware and controls almost everything—from stealing the victim's data to deleting it.
All of its capabilities are discussed later in this blog.

Figure 3 : Code showing the hiding icon and starting service.
As MainService is the main controller, the developer has taken the appropriate actions to
keep it functional and running at all times.
The malware developer uses various tactics to do so, and one of them is using Android's
broadcast receivers. Broadcast receivers are components that allow you to register for
various Android events. In this case, it registers three broadcast receivers:
MyReceiver - Triggers when the device is booted.
Intercept Call - Triggers on incoming and outgoing calls.
AlarmReceiver - Triggers every three minutes.
MyReceiver and AlarmReceiver start the MainService whenever appropriate events occur.
This tactic is very common among malware developers to ensure the malware is not killed
by the Android OS or by any other means.
Figure 4 shows MyReceiver in action where it eventually calls the MainService service.

Figure 4 : MyReceiver broadcast receiver.
The InterceptCall receiver is triggered whenever there is an incoming or outgoing call. It
sets particular parameters in relation to call details and a further service named calls takes
the control as seen in Figure 5.

5/12

Figure 5 : Code for the calls service
As seen above, the calls service stores incoming call details in .mp3 format in
the /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/ directory with file name appended with "In_'' for incoming calls and
"Out_'' for outgoing calls. How these recorded calls are sent to the command and control
server (CnC) is taken care of by MainService, which is discussed next.
MainService is the central controller of this spyware. It controls each and every functionality
based on the commands sent by the command and control (C&C) server.
As soon as this service is started, it creates two processes that take care of connection and
disconnection to the C&C server. This functionality can be seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6 : The timer task.
MainService has the following capabilities:
Steal SMS messages
Send SMS messages
Steal the victim's location
Capture photos
Execute commands
Capture screenshots
Call phone numbers
Initiate other apps
Steal Facebook credentials, etc

6/12

All of the above functionalities take place on the basis of commands sent by the attacker.
Stolen data is stored in external storage under the /DCIM/ directory with a hidden subdirectory named ".dat".
Below is the list of all the commands catered by the C&C server.

We don't have the space to cover all of the commands, but let's take a look at some of the
major ones.

Facebook phishing
One of the interesting features of this spyware is the ability to steal Facebook credentials
using a fake login page, similar to phishing.
Upon receiving the command GUIFXB, the spyware launches a fake Facebook login page.
As soon as the victim tries to log in, it stores the victim's credentials in /storage/0/DCIM/.fdat

Figure 7 : Fake Facebook login

8/12

The second command is IODBSSUEEZ, which further sends stolen credentials to the C&C
server, as seen in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Sending data to the attacker.

This functionality can be easily further extended to steal other information, such as bank
credentials, although we did not see any banks being targeted in this attack.
Calling functionality
Command PHOCAs7 initiates calling functionality. The number to call is received along with
the command, as seen in Figure 9.

Figure 9 : The calling functionality.

9/12

The phone number is fetched from a response from the C&C server and is stored in str3
variable, which further is utilized using the tel: function.
Stealing SMS
The Gxextsxms command is responsible for fetching all the SMS messages from the
victim's device and sending it over to the C&C server.

Figure 10: Stealing SMS messages.
Similarly, there are many crucial commands that further allow this spyware to perform
additional functionality, such as executing commands sent by the C&C, clicking photos,
capturing screenshots, stealing location information, and more.
Further analysis
Upon further research, we found this spyware to be developed by a framework similar to
Spynote and Spymax, meaning this could be an updated version of these Trojan
builders, which allow anyone, even with limited knowledge, to develop full-fledged spyware.
Many of the functionalities seen in this spyware are similar to Spynote and Spymax based
on the samples we analyzed with some modifications. This spyware sample communicates
over dynamic DNS. By doing so, attackers can easily set up the Trojan to communicate
back to them without any need for high-end servers. Other common functionalities include
executing commands received from the attacker, taking screenshots of the victim's device,
fetching locations, stealing SMS messages and most common features that every spyware
may poses.

Stealing Facebook credentials using fake Facebook activity is something we didn't observe
in Spynote/Spymax versions but was seen in this spyware.

10/12

This framework allows anyone to develop a malicious app with the desired icon and
communication address. Some of the icons used can be seen below. We found 280 such
apps in the past three months. A complete list of hashes can be found here.

Figure 11: Icons used to pose as famous apps.
All of these apps are developed by the same framework and hence have the same package
name and certificate information as seen in Figure 12.

Conclusion
Due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices and the widespread use of Android, it is very
easy for attackers to victimize Android users. In such situations, mobile users should always
take the utmost precautions while downloading any applications from the internet. It is very
easy to trick victims to fall for such attacks.
Users looking forward to using the TikTok app amidst the ban might look for alternative
methods to download the app. In doing so, users can mistakenly install malicious apps,
such as the spyware mentioned in this blog.
The precautions you take online have been covered extensively in almost all of our blogs;
even so, we believe this information bears repeating. Please follow these basic precautions
during the current crisis—and at all times:
Install apps only from official stores, such as Google Play.
Never click on unknown links received through ads, SMS messages, emails, or
the like.
11/12

Always keep the "Unknown Sources" option disabled in the Android device. This
disallows apps to be installed on your device from unknown sources.
We would also like to mention that if you come across an app hiding it's icon, always try to
search for the app in your device settings (by going to Settings -> Apps -> Search for icon
that was hidden). In the case of this spyware, search for app named TikTok Pro.
