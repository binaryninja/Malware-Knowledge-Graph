Executive Summary
Since September 2020, Unit 42 researchers have observed Egregor ransomware affecting
multiple industries globally, including those within the U.S, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin
America, following the decline in operations utilizing the Maze ransomware. Egregor
operations mimic that of Maze operations, leading us to believe that although Maze
operators announced a shutdown of the “Maze Team Project,” the operators behind those
activities have simply developed a new ransomware to move their objectives forward.

Due to the surge in Egregor ransomware activity, we’ve created this general threat
assessment for overall threat awareness. Full visualization of the techniques observed and
their relevant courses of action can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.

Malware Overview
Egregor is a variant of the Sekhmet ransomware family. It has been observed since at least
September 2020, around the same time when Maze ransomware operators announced an
intent to shut down their operations. Affiliates who utilized the Maze ransomware to conduct
their activities now appear to have likely moved on to Egregor to avoid disrupting their
operations.
Maze ransomware leveraged malware such as Trickbot, and Egregor has followed suit, using
commodity malware such as Qakbot, IcedID and Ursnif for initial access. Ryuk ransomware
also leveraged both Trickbot and BazaLoader in a similar fashion to gain initial access to a
victim system.
After initial infection, scripts are used to modify victim firewalls and enable Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP). Cobalt Strike is used to conduct network reconnaissance, move laterally
across the network, exfiltrate data and prepare for execution.
During our analysis, we observed a ZIP file containing a PowerShell script (Figure 1) that
attempts to uninstall a McAfee endpoint agent. It then uses BITS to download the Egregor
DLL from a malicious server and execute the payload using Rundll32.

Figure 1.PowerShell script used to download Egregor ransomware.
Egregor uses multiple anti-analysis and evasion techniques, such as disabling a system’s
antivirus software and heavily obfuscating the payload. Also, the payload can only be
executed with a key using the expected command-line argument, in this case “passegregor10”. When run on the victim’s system, Egregor changes the files’ extensions to a
random set of characters. When the encryption of files is complete, the ransomware creates
the ransom note file “RECOVER-FILES.txt” in all folders that contain encrypted files.

Figure 2. Egregor’s “Hall of Shame.”
The ransom note provides instructions with a three-day deadline to pay the ransom. If no
contact is made within that timeframe, the victim risks exposure of all exfiltrated data on the
Egregor “Hall of Shame” (Figure 2). Visible on the Hall of Shame is a visitor number and a
progress percentage apparently referring to uploading data. We suspect that these numbers
are used to aid the threat actors’ ransom negotiations.
More information on ransomware can be found in the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat
Report.

Conclusion
In the short period of its observed activities, Egregor ransomware has compromised
industries globally, including those within the U.S, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Organizations should be aware of and monitor the use of commodity malware, such as
Qakbot, IcedID and Ursnif, that could end up delivering Egregor ransomware as a secondstage payload. Like Maze and other current variants, Egregor ransomware affiliates use
double extortion. They host an extortion website called the “Hall of Shame” site to create
additional pressure and shame their victims into paying the ransom.

5/6

With the fall of Maze ransomware and the rise of Egregor, we suspect the group behind this
ransomware will remain active in the following months and will continue their efforts to target
high-profile organizations.
Indicators associated with this Threat Assessment are available on GitHub, have been
published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed and are viewable via the ATOM Viewer.
In addition to the above courses of action, AutoFocus customers can review additional
activity by using the tag Egregor.
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of
compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members
