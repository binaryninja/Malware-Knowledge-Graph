Recorded Future analyzed an intrusion into one of our client’s networks and collaborated
with Rapid7 to determine the scope of a cyberespionage campaign assessed to be
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, APT10. This report details the
campaign using data acquired from targeted host networks, the Recorded FutureⓇ
Platform, network metadata, VirusTotal, Farsight DNS, Shodan, and other OSINT
techniques.
Norwegian company Visma, who was targeted in the attack, and U.S. company Rapid7
provided support and extensive expertise throughout this research. Industry collaboration is
a vital enabler in illuminating threats and offering protection to organizations at risk from
hostile, state-sponsored economic cyberespionage.

This report will be of most value to network defenders and corporate risk executives within
companies that utilize services from managed IT service providers and cloud hosting
providers. The report will also be of interest to companies with an exposed third-party
supply chain.

Executive Summary
A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United
States and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November
2017 and September 2018. Based on the technical data uncovered, and in light of
recent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on the ongoing activities of
Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, we assess with high confidence that these
incidents were conducted by APT10 (also known as Stone Panda, menuPass, CVNX) in
an effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain
commercial advantage.
The targeted companies included:
IT and business cloud services managed service provider (MSP) and Recorded
Future client and supplier, Visma, a billion-dollar Norwegian company with at
least 850,000 customers globally
An international apparel company
A U.S. law firm with strong experience in intellectual property law with clients in
the pharmaceutical, technology, electronics, biomedical, and automotive sectors,
among others
In all three incidents, the attackers gained access to networks through deployments of
Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials. The
attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim
networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on
APT10 to deliver malware. During the Visma intrusion, APT10 deployed their Trochilus
malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4
and Salsa20 streaming ciphers rather than the typically observed RC4 variant. On the
two other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT
(ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
APT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR (deployed
by the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows
command-line tool. The same Dropbox account was also accessed in a similar fashion
by the attackers during the apparel company intrusion. Dropbox was also used to
store exfiltrated documents from the third victim, a U.S. law firm, with the files again
exfiltrated using identical TTPs and uploaded using cURL for Windows.
We believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to
global corporations known to date. On top of the breadth, volume, and targets of
attacks that APT10 has conducted since at least 2016, we now know that these
operations are being run by the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State
Security (MSS).

Utilizing actors working for shell companies such as Huaying Haitai Science and
Technology Development Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司), and under the direct
supervision of their regional bureau in Tianjin, the MSS has conducted an
unprecedented campaign, dubbed “Operation Cloud Hopper,” against managed IT
service providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary
attacks against their clients. Access to the networks of these third-party service
providers grants the MSS the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds, if
not thousands, of corporations around the world. We assess that APT10 likely
compromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their
client networks, and not of stealing Visma intellectual property.
In this same time frame, APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and an international
apparel company, likely to gather information for commercial advantage. In all three
incidents, APT10 actors used previously acquired legitimate credentials, possibly
gained via a third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access to the
law firm and the apparel company.

Key Judgments
We have identified a new variant of Trochilus malware, with its C2
communications encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream
ciphers.
An UPPERCUT backdoor was identified in the targeting of an international
apparel company and U.S. law firm. The backdoor was deployed using the
Notepad++ updater and sideloading malicious DLL, as noted in APT10’s targeting
of Japanese corporations in July 2018.
In addition to using Trochilus and UPPERCUT, APT10 utilized a series of
3/21

previously known and associated attack TTPs for all three of these intrusions.
Some of these TTPs include:
Transferring tools from the C2 to the host using BITSAdmin-scheduled
tasks into C:\ProgramData\temp
Use of DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed
malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload
into memory
Use of legitimate credentials, possibly acquired through previous MSP
compromises, to log in to accessible Citrix Remote Desktop clients in
targeted organizations

Background
APT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. It has historically
targeted healthcare, defense, aerospace, government, heavy industry and mining, and
MSPs and IT services, as well as other sectors, for probable intellectual property theft.
In early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service
providers (MSPs) that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their
customers’ networks. During this operation (dubbed “‘Cloud Hopper” because of the
group’s use of popular western cloud-based services), APT10 utilized both new
malware (Quasar RAT, Trochilus, RedLeaves, ChChes) as well as some familiar old tools
(Poison Ivy, PlugX).
Most recently, on December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two
hackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) with global
computer intrusion campaigns targeting intellectual property. This indictment
attributed the intrusions to APT10, a group that had been conducting the malicious
activities for over a decade on behalf of the MSS, China’s civilian human intelligence
agency. Some of the material included within the indictment corroborated information
detailed in the Intrusion Truth blog that provided strong evidence attributing APT10 to
the Tianjin State Security Bureau, a provincial bureau of the Ministry of State Security.
In the blog, Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having utilized several Tianjin-based
companies, including Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd.
and Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd.

The use of suspected shell companies as a front for MSS-enabled cyber activity isn’t a
new observation, however. Our research from 2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC
(and therefore the MSS) directed the activities of a company named Boyusec, which
was identified as a shell company for APT3.

The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious activities breached
at least 45 companies and managed service providers in 12 countries, including Brazil,
Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab

Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

About Visma
Visma offers software and services that simplify and digitize core business processes
in the private and public sector. The Visma group operates across the entire Nordic
region along with Benelux, Central, and Eastern Europe. With 8,500 employees, more
than 850,000 customers, and a net revenue of NOK 8,537 million (approximately $1
billion USD) in 2017, Visma is one of Europe’s leading software companies.

Intrusion Overview
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for several years, focusing
specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure
providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017. We were particularly
interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were
subsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access through
compromised MSP networks.
In September 2018, one of our clients (and a supplier as well), Visma, reached out to us
for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a
breach notification by Rapid7. Visma provided us with malware samples and network
logs from the event. Analysis of the data revealed that Visma’s Citrix infrastructure had
been probed and subsequently accessed using stolen credentials as early as August
17, 2018. This was followed by an initial exploitation, network enumeration, and
malicious tool deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial
access. The theft of enterprise login credentials was conducted within two and a half
weeks of initial access.
On August 30, 2018, APT10 deployed their first modified version of Trochilus that had
its C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more
common RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild. This sample, similar to other
Trochilus samples, was deployed using a DLL sideloading method utilizing three files,
uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory
TA17-117A (last revised on December 20, 2018). This method involves the use of a
legitimate binary (File 1) used to load a malicious DLL (File 2). The malicious DLL is
renamed to match the name of an expected DLL to be loaded by the executable. The
malicious DLL then decrypts and decompresses shellcode contained within a third file
placed by the attackers in the same temporary folder. The configuration file then loads
the Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process. This
method of malicious payload installation is a well-documented TTP of APT10.
The attackers used Mimikatz (pd.exe) to enable credential theft and made use of
scheduled tasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility to transfer files from their C2 to
the Visma network. The attackers preferred to upload their malicious tooling to the
C:\ProgramData\temp or C:\ProgramData\media directories and executed commands
using batch files (x.bat). A full list of the filenames of the suspected attacker tooling can
be found in the report appendices.

BITSAdmin example commands used by the attackers.
In order to exfiltrate the compromised data, the attackers employed custom malware
that used Dropbox as its C2. They also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows, both often
renamed, to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the
Dropbox API.
Our research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and found that the
attackers had used the same account to store exfiltrated data from a global apparel
company. They also identified broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a
U.S. law firm specializing in intellectual property law. The firm has a dedicated China
practice aimed at assisting Chinese companies entering the U.S. market.
Rapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in late 2017, followed by
the apparel company a few months later, and finally, the Visma attack in August 2018.
In one of the attacks, Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in
order to run the payload script on the victim desktop. Interestingly, in all three attacks,
the targeting of Citrix remote desktops was a common thread. Additionally, the same
DLL sideloading technique observed in the Visma attack was used, and many of the
tools deployed by the attackers shared naming similarities as well (1.bat, cu.exe, ss.rar,
r.exe, pd.exe). Most interestingly, Rapid7 observed the use of the Notepad++ updater
gup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to
deploy a variant of the UPPERCUT backdoor (also known as ANEL). APT10 used this
approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese corporations in July 2018.

The Visma Attack
APT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around August 17, 2018.
Examination of network logs revealed an employee’s credentials were stolen and used
to authenticate to the network outside of her normal working hours. While we are
confident that APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using stolen
employee Citrix remote desktop credentials, it is not clear how or when these
credentials were initially compromised.
Throughout August 2018, the APT10 actors regularly logged in to the Visma network
via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were
consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
On each occasion, the logins were from one of eight VPN endpoints that resolved to IPs
in the following tightly defined subnets:
Subnet

VPN Consumer Network is an ambiguous Panama-registered entity. Based on
information in WHOIS registration records, the website for the company is
vpnconsumer.com, which is a nondescript landing page only containing the abuse
contact details and a physical address in Panama. BGP routing information shows that
the organization manages 44/24 subnets hosted around the world, many of which
resolve to low-cost VPN services, such as ExpressVPN.
Insikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN endpoint IPs revealed
consistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs
starting on August 17, 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s
network was made using stolen credentials.
After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the
network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL
sideloading technique. Two separate infection chains leveraging this specific DLL
sideloading technique were identified on the Visma network using legitimate known
good binaries that had DLL search-order path issues. This means that APT10 actors
had two separate access points into the Visma network.

Infection Chain 1: August 30, 2018
Once on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to
copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on
173.254.236[.]158 to the \ProgramData\temp\ directory on the infected host.
The copied files included:
A legitimate binary for the uninstaller for PDF printing application PDF-Xchange
2011 Lite DE, renamed from unins000.exe to CASTSP.exe
(f6e0f076e27391a6e6eb23f23f77c2ff078488875113df388640aca8bf4dd64b)
An accompanying malicious DLL, version.dll
(10182f0e64b765db989c158402c76eb1e0e862cab407f7c5cec133d8e5cb73e3)
A DES-encrypted shellcode configuration containing the Trochilus implant into
the same folder
(42b5eb1f77a25ad73202d3be14e1833ef0502b0b6ae7ab54f5d4b5c2283429c6)
After the files were copied across the attacker-executed CASTSP.exe, this file
sideloaded and ran version.dll, which in turn decrypted and decompressed the
encrypted shellcode and injected the Trochilus payload into memory.

Infection Chain 1.

Infection Chain 2: September 4, 2018
A few days later, APT10 used an almost identical approach used during Infection Chain
1 to deploy Trochilus onto another part of Visma’s network. While the deployed DLL
and the encrypted shellcode were named differently, the underlying method of
malware installation was the same as Infection Chain 1. The files remotely copied into
C:\ProgramData\temp\ using BITSAdmin included:
Another dropper renamed to “CASTSP.exe” that this time was a legitimately
signed Microsoft Visual Studio binary TailoredDeploy.Host.exe (also known as
TailoredDeploy.exe)
(fc6a130504b54fa72cfc104c656fe2cd92d7998f42ca064e22167e1d402a1514)
A malicious DLL, vcruntime140.dll
(eed0c7f7d36e75382c83e945a8b00abf01d3762b973c952dec05ceccb34b487d)
A DES-encrypted Trochilus payload
(e6280de09f9adf79212409529eb25c0c2ea73e33a50281e22228a3db3998eecb)
The execution method was identical: CASTSP.exe sideloaded and ran vcruntime140.dll,
which decrypted and decompressed the encrypted shellcode configuration and
injected the Trochilus payload into a system process in-memory on the host machine.

Infection Chain 2.

Malware Analysis
The malware sets used for both infection chains are nearly identical both in infection
method and code structure. Because the malware for both infection chains were so
similar, it is only necessary to include the in-depth analysis for one chain here, so we
focused on Infection Chain 1. It included the binaries below:
CASTSP.exe: A valid and signed application that utilizes DLL sideloading to
execute the malicious DLL, “version.dll”
Version.dll: Main functionality of “Version.dll” is to decrypt and execute the
Trochilus payload
CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI: DES-encrypted Trochilus payload
10/21

Trochilus Implant
The Trochilus loader, version.dll, has four entry points, as shown below. The malicious
entrypoint called by CASTSP.exe is DllEntryPoint.

After version.dll runs, it loads the file CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI into memory. The file
“CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI” is 387,094 bytes of binary code that is not human-readable.

After the file is loaded, the next function, sub_6a351000, starts the decryption routine
for CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI. The file is DES-encrypted and the key can be identified
being loaded into memory at the start of the decryption routine.

11/21

Once the payload is decrypted, version.dll creates a new process in a suspended state
and writes the Trochilus payload into the suspended process. Next, version.dll
resumes the process, executing the Trochilus payload.

Trochilus attribution.
This variant of Trochilus is significantly different from some of the reported variants. 1
The C2 infrastructure, network communications, and encryption are different from
prior versions, but the code similarities and the use of DLL sideloading demonstrate
that this is just another variant of Trochilus. First, the libraries below are included in
the Trochilus variant and are known to be a part of the source code upon which
Trochilus is based on.
SelfDestruction.cpp
MySocket.cpp
CommManager.cpp
Common.cpp
12/21

Main.cpp
Manager.cpp
ServiceManager.cpp
TCPComm.cpp
UDPComm.cpp
Second, the unencrypted C2 beacon, _msgid.23.__serial.0.clientid.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, is a
well-defined component of the Trochilus source code.
The capabilities of Trochilus are well documented in other research reports, but the C2
infrastructure for this variant uses a combination of XOR, RC4, and Salsa20, which is
different from what has previously been reported for Trochilus.

Command and Control Infrastructure
The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com is hardcoded, and after a successful DNS
request for the IP address, the Trochilus implant will use that IP address for
communication.

The encoding and encryption routines used in this variant are different from other
variants and use three stages of encryption. Other variants have typically used XOR
encoding with RC4 encryption to obfuscate C2 communication.

Stage 1: Rolling XOR Function
The first stage is a simple rolling XOR function. The rolling XOR key is computed by
taking two initial values, Constant 1 and Constant 2, and adding them together. The
result is then divided against the divisor 0xff. The remainder of this result is used as
the XOR key. On the second iteration, Constant 1 is now saved as Constant 2, and
Constant 2 becomes the remainder from the previous operation. They are added

13/21

together and again divided by the divisor 0xff to produce the next XOR key. This
process repeats until the end of the cleartext string. A Python script is provided below
showing this encoding function.

Our analysis revealed that the “__msgid.23.” cleartext string below was sent to the XOR
function above.

Stage 2: RC4 Encryption
The resulting data then goes to the second stage, which is RC4 encryption using the
hard-coded string
NASDKJF7832Hnkjsadf878UHds89iujkhNHKJDHJDH8UIYE98uihwjshewde8w. The main
routine shown below takes the key and then sends it to the function sub_B49252,
which initializes the key-scheduling algorithm (KSA) and pseudo-random generation
algorithm (PRGA), which are the two key components of RC4 encryption.

Stage 3: Salsa20 Encryption
14/21

For the final phase, the resulting data from the RC4 encryption is then encrypted again,
this time with Salsa20. Salsa20 is another stream cipher that encrypts data in 64-byte
blocks. Salsa20 uses a secret key and nonce to initialize the encryption. These values
are hard-coded and are:
Secret Key: 0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,0x5,0x6,0x7,0x8,0x9,0xA,0xB,0xC,0xD,0xE,0xF,0x10
Nonce: 0x65,0x66,0x67,0x68,0x69,0x6A,0x6B,0x6C (“efghijkl”)

After the message is encrypted, it is then sent via an HTTP POST to the C2 host, which
in this case is the domain www.miphomanager[.]com. The HTTP headers are provided
in the figure below.

15/21

Infrastructure
DNS log data revealed that requests were made for the malicious Trochilus C2 domain,
www.miphomanager[.]com, as early as August 30, 2018 — only two weeks after Visma
was initially compromised on August 17, 2018. This slight delay may point to the
handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team APT10
effort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack.
According to WHOIS information, the malicious miphomanager domain was registered
with a relatively small Bahamas-based domain registrar, internet.bs. This registrar is
widely noted to host a disproportionate number of rogue or malicious websites, with
the registrar aggressively marketing itself as an “offshore” registrar. Other examples of
malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for APT28’s
VPNFilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut[.]org domain
that was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat
actor CyberBerkut.
The registrant organization name was privacy protected using Whois Privacy Corp, and
the registered name servers for the malicious C2 were listed as:
Ns-canada.topdns[.]com
Ns-uk.topdns[.]com
Ns-usa.topdns[.]com
Internet.bs and the name servers listed above were noted in the registration of a
malicious C2 used in a KHRAT campaign targeting Cambodia. KHRAT is a backdoor
trojan purported to be used with the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK.
All three name servers appear in Recorded Future with an unusual risk rating as they
appear in the “Bambenek Consulting C&C Nameserver Blocklist” threat list, because of
their prevalence in being associated with a Zeus-based banking trojan, Sphinx.

Credential Harvesting and Exfiltration
During our investigation, we also found evidence of a legitimate decompression utility
typically packaged with Java named “unpack200.exe” being executed on the Visma
network. This utility sideloaded Mimikatz (pd.exe) and enabled credential theft from

16/21

Visma users. Interestingly, the same combination of unpack200.exe to deploy Mimikatz
was used by the same attackers in both the apparel company and U.S.-based law firm
breaches.
Using the newly acquired credentials, the attacker accessed Visma’s Microsoft Active
Directory domain controller, deployed Trochilus, and made a copy of the “NTDS.DIT”
database file containing Active Directory data for Visma’s corporate network, including
password hashes for all users in the domain.
The NTDS.DIT file and accompanying stolen data was then packaged up using a
renamed WinRAR executable (r.exe) that was transferred across by the attacker who
then used cURL for Windows (renamed to “CU.exe”) to upload the exfil to
content.dropboxapi.com. The RAR files followed a naming convention of a short run of
repeating characters (for example, kkk.rar, ss.rar, pp.rar, dds.rar, gggg.rar, etc).
Rapid7 research revealed the exfiltrated content from Visma was uploaded to a
Dropbox account that contained files from another incident related to the compromise
of an international apparel company that they were investigating.

US-Based Law Firm Attack
In late 2017, Rapid7 responded to a breach at a U.S.-based law firm. The attacker first
gained access to the victim environment through Citrix servers. Once inside the victim
network, the attacker deployed their own customized malware and also used known
good binaries that have DLL search order hijacking issues in order to perform DLL
sideloading to execute customized versions of Mimikatz in order to retrieve
passwords. The filename for the custom malware was “ccSEUPDT.exe” (MD5:
d8e37f07fdc9827871f0f959519275e1), a legitimate Symantec Security Submission
Engine Update Module binary. The custom malware also would have a DLL in the same
staging directory and a randomized 15-character uppercase and lowercase alpha
character set filename without an extension that contained the shellcode. The attacker
used unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), a decompression
program that comes with Java 8 and their copy of Mimikatz was placed into
MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: c8ea12ee884f274ca35fa54a073df130).
These methods of initial ingress into the victim networks and the method of obtaining
passwords remained consistent TTPs across all victims. The DLL sideloading technique
can evade application whitelisting and antivirus software. However, if deployed,
systems that perform process.start creation would log the command line being passed
to the binary and could be reviewed, and then signatures created that look for the
common flags could be passed to Mimikatz. The attacker would also move laterally by
mounting the remote drive on a system, copying “1.bat” to it, use task scheduler to
execute, and then delete the batch script.
In order to perform exfiltration of the stolen data, the attacker used common file
compression utilities (rar.exe) to create archives of the information they intended to
exfiltrate, and then used common command line-based web clients (curl.exe) to
transfer the stolen data to a cloud-based storage provider (Dropbox). This TTP for data
exfiltration remained consistent across all victims.
17/21

To maintain access to the victim network from the external public internet, the attacker
deployed password-protected ASP eval webshells (Filename “iisstart.aspx,” SHA256:
243d47fc2a24b391e1153d5c7807c6e5de51aba65fc79465d7b3e5c64d5fac41) within
the client environment in order to maintain access.

This resembled the server-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper webshell
documented previously. Uploads to VirusTotal in late August 2018 resembling the
same filename, iisstart.aspx, indicate the deployed webshell was likely a version of the
China Chopper webshell known to have been used by several Chinese threat actors.
The attacker also used TeamViewer in order to maintain remote access to
compromised systems within the victim environment.

International Apparel Company Attack
In early 2018, Rapid7 identified that the attackers compromised an apparel company,
based upon detections and intelligence gathered from the U.S.-based law firm breach.
The attacker gained access to the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and
authenticated to them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned
by VPN Consumer Network. Rapid7 again observed the attackers dropping payloads
named “ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used identical TTPs for executing malware and
Mimikatz as observed before, by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that
had DLL search order path issues. The attackers used the Notepad++ updater GUP.exe
(MD5: f5322b2f18605674b9a0c1757de5fd94), the Java archive decompression utility
unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), renamed from
“coInst.exe,” and Norton Identity Safe binary CASRTSP.exe (MD5:
1e3a57cff7cba8732364c26f4bbdcbe2). These binaries were used to load malware from
DLL files MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: 5739c1f17503e21e56667d53ea823401) and libcurl.dll
(MD5: 8f07160febdb240909b27aa519bba575). Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in
the victim’s environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2. The
attackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive
on a system, copying 1.bat to it, using task scheduler to execute the batch script, and
finally, deleting the batch script.
For exfiltration of stolen data, the attacker used WinRAR and renamed “rar.exe” to
“r.exe” to create archives, upload them with “curl.exe” (renamed to “c.exe”), and again,
use the cloud storage provider Dropbox. Rapid7 discovered that additional data was
placed into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the
compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by
Visma. Rapid7 then provided a breach notification to Visma to alert them to this
compromise in September 2018.

Outlook
We identified three victims of cyberespionage operations since late 2017 across the
18/21

managed IT service provider, retail, and legal sectors. The targeted sectors vary
significantly, indicating a wide scope of targeting for the group. We assess with high
confidence that the attacks were conducted by Chinese MSS threat actor, APT10, based
on the evidence outlined in this report, summarized below:
1. The use of a variant of the Trochilus malware. While the variant has not been
noted publicly previously, Trochilus is widely used by APT10.
2. The use of legitimate binaries to sideload malicious DLLs that decrypt and
decompress shellcode configuration files containing a Trochilus payload.
3. The use of Notepad++ updater (filename “gup.exe”) to load malicious DLL
(libcurl.dll) in the deployment of the APT10 backdoor, UPPERCUT.
4. Extensive use of command-line tools including, but not limited to, Mimikatz, cURL
for Windows, BITSAdmin, and WinRAR, to perform actions on-host.
5. The targeting of a Norwegian MSP, which enabled potential access to an
extensive customer base. We believe that the APT10 targeting of Visma is an
extension of their 2017 Cloud Hopper operation (which victimized some of the
world’s largest MSPs) and has continued into late 2018.
6. The unauthorized access to Citrix remote desktop clients at Visma using stolen
credentials occured at times corresponding to Tianjin working hours (GMT +8).
We believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat
to global corporations. Their unprecedented campaign against MSPs, alleged to have
included some of the largest MSPs in the world, in order to conduct secondary attacks
against their clients, grants the Chinese state the ability to potentially access the
networks of hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world.
This campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the
Five Eyes nations, led by the U.S. Department of Justice indictment against APT10
actors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being
conducted by the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Crucially, the variety of businesses
targeted prove that these campaigns are being conducted against corporations across
the commercial spectrum, aimed at undermining international norms in trade to
erode the competitive advantage of companies that have invested heavily in patented
technology.
This report, alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10 operations, acutely
highlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains. Often, third parties in the
supply chain are less likely to adopt high-end, expensive security measures, and
therefore offer an attacker a convenient access vector to target interconnected
organizations. Also, the targeting of cloud providers exploits the trust companies place
in the security of the cloud services they use.
Based on available information, we assess that this intrusion was conducted by the
group that is known as APT10. However, during the course of this investigation, we
have had privileged conversations that lead us to believe that in the future, portions of
what is now known as APT10 will be recategorized as a new group. There is insufficient
data at this time to make that distinction.

Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures outlined
in this section in conjunction with the advice published by US-CERT 2 and the U.K.’s
NCSC3 when defending against APT10 attempts to gain network access.
Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems
(IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon
review, consider blocking illicit connection attempts from — the external IP
addresses and domains listed in Appendix A.
Implement the provided SNORT rules in Appendix B into your IDS and IPS
appliance and investigate any alerts generated for activity resembling the TTPs
outlined in this report on APT10.
Conduct regular Yara scans across your enterprise for the new rules listed in
Appendix C and those listed in the official U.S. and U.K. government advisories
listed above.
Consider blocking any connection attempts emanating from IPs resolving to “VPN
Consumer Network” (listed in Appendix B) and consider implementing a VPN
whitelisting policy based on approved vendors.
Detection of potential ASP eval webshells can be difficult, but can be
accomplished by deploying file integrity monitoring of the web root directories
on all servers with a client environment.
Detection of exfiltration based on network flow data would be difficult if the
attacker chose to use the same cloud storage provider that the victim has
standardized upon. However, if SSL is proxied for monitoring, signatures can be
created to identify this activity by checking the user agent or method of client
header construction against the Dropbox client applications themselves.
Ensure you have DNS response policy zones enabled for your enterprise. If so,
consider detecting, alerting, and blocking requests for the nameservers below
associated with the disproportionately malicious domain registrar internet.bs:
ns-uk.topdns.com
ns-usa.topdns.com
ns-canada.topdns.com
