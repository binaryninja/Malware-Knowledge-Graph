Executive Summary
On Dec. 8, 2020, one of the leading cybersecurity companies in the industry, FireEye,
reported a breach and data exfiltration unlike any that we have seen previously. What makes
this attack unique is not only the target, FireEye being a well-known cybersecurity company,
but that the stolen data contains the internal, custom-crafted red-team and penetration
testing tools used by the company to imitate different threat actors during customer security
consultations. FireEye’s blog provided a wealth of information for defenders to implement
security controls and mitigations for defense against the stolen tools. This data is being used
by Palo Alto Networks to help ensure our customers are protected if the attackers choose to
utilize the tools for malicious purposes.

It is important to note that these custom tools were not released into the wild, they were
stolen by a sophisticated threat actor and we likely will not see a sudden widespread use of
them. That being said, FireEye went beyond what was required – and what companies have
done in the past – in releasing detection techniques. Providing defenders access to the Yara
rules, indicators of compromise (IOCs), Snort signatures and other threat data is a class act
and very much appreciated by defenders and researchers at Palo Alto Networks – and
surely across the industry as a whole.

Protecting Our Customers
Palo Alto Networks has been working diligently to ensure the protections released by
FireEye are implemented in a timely manner. The Github repository shared by FireEye
contains a list of rules and 16 vulnerability CVE identifiers. The vulnerabilities appear to have
been included because sufficient protections against these can help limit the effectiveness of
the red-team tools.
Palo Alto Networks has ensured the protections within our products are either already in
place or are being prioritized for the provided vulnerabilities and their exploitation. These
vulnerabilities range from a wide variety of products, and as always, we highly recommend
our customers stay current with their updates and patch all vulnerable software.
The Github repository that provided the protections also contains rules for direct product
implementation as well as hunting. Palo Alto Networks is analyzing the efficacy of and
applying all stable rules to our respective products. Gap analysis and threat hunting
leveraging the FireEye-provided Yara and Snort signatures have enabled Palo Alto Networks
researchers to identify potential malware samples that we are now tagging, analyzing,
tracking and building protections around within WildFire. Continual verdict efficacy checks of
identified malware samples is ongoing within Palo Alto Networks products. Customers
leveraging the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus tool can track initially identified samples and
tools under the Fireye_RedTeam_Tools, Rubeus, AndrewSpecial, KeeFarce, SafetyKatz,
InveighZero, GadgetToJScript, SeatBelt, RuralBishop, SharpView, and SharpZeroLogon
tags. Our Cortex XDR Managed Threat Hunting Team (MTH) has proactively searched all
Cortex XDR Pro customer logs to identify potentially impacted organizations and provide
them an assessment of their risk.
Cortex XDR customers are protected using the product’s WildFire integration as well as
through Local Analysis, the Password theft prevention module, and the behavioral threat
protection (BTP) engine. In addition, multiple Behavioural Indicators of Compromise (BIOCs)
are available in XDR Server to detect malicious techniques exhibited by the stolen tools.
Threat Prevention provides protection against command and control beacons and
exploitation of network vulnerabilities used by the stolen tools. The following table provides
an overview of the mapping between Palo Alto Networks Universal Threat IDs (UTIDs) and
the provided FireEye SIDs.

Conclusion
The protections in place for our customers are continually being updated for this breach and
for all threats that are identified in the wild. Palo Alto Networks appreciates the information
disclosure from FireEye, but we also want to emphasize that at the time this report is
published, the tools, hashes of the tools and associated samples have not been disclosed to
the public. From the perspective of Palo Alto Networks security researchers, the biggest
threat from this breach is the actor and the techniques they were able to utilize in order to
infiltrate the FireEye infrastructure. Currently, there has not been any information released on
the breach or the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Customers
should know that Palo Alto Networks researchers are working diligently to ensure protections
are in place for our entire product ecosystem.
