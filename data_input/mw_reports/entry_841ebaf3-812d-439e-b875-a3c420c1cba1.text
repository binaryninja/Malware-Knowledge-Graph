Executive Summary
TeamTNT has been evolving their cloud-focused cryptojacking operations for some time now. TeamTNT operations have targeted
and, after compromise, exfiltrated AWS credentials, targeted Kubernetes clusters and created new malware called Black-T that
integrates open source cloud native tools to assist in their cryptojacking operations. TeamTNT operations are now using compromised
AWS credentials to enumerate AWS cloud environments, via the AWS platform’s API. These actions attempt to identify all Identity
and Access Management (IAM) permissions, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets,
CloudTrail configurations and CloudFormation operations granted to the compromised AWS credential. TeamTNT operations are now
also targeting the credentials of 16 additional applications, including those of AWS and Google Cloud credentials, which may be
stored on the compromised cloud instance, if installed.
The presence of Google Cloud credentials being targeted for collections represents the first known instance of an attacker group
targeting IAM credentials on compromised cloud instances outside of AWS. While it is still possible that Microsoft Azure, Alibaba
Cloud, Oracle Cloud or IBM Cloud IAM credentials could be targeted using similar methods, Unit 42 researchers have yet to find
evidence of credentials from these cloud service providers (CSPs) being targeted. TeamTNT first started collecting AWS credentials
on cloud instances they had compromised as early as August 2020.
In addition to the targeting of 16 application credentials from cloud applications and platforms, TeamTNT has added the usage of the
open-source Kubernetes and cloud penetration toolset Peirates to their reconnaissance operations. With these techniques available,
TeamTNT actors are increasingly more capable of gathering enough information in target AWS and Google Cloud environments to
perform additional post-exploitation operations. This could lead to more cases of lateral movement and potential privilege escalation
attacks that could ultimately allow TeamTNT actors to acquire administrative access to an organization’s entire cloud environment.
That said, TeamTNT operations are still focused on cryptojacking. The TeamTNT cryptojacking operations represented within this
writing have collected 6.52012192 Monero coins, which at the time of this writing equaled $1,788 USD. The mining operation was
found to be operating at an average speed of 77.7KH/s across eight mining workers. Operations using this Monero wallet address
have continued for 114 days as of the time of this writing.
Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud customers are protected from these threats through the Runtime Protection feature, Cryptominer
Detection feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance Protection, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes
configuration and provides secure alternatives. Additionally, Palo Alto Networks VM-Series and CN-Series products offer cloud
protections that can prevent network connections from cloud instances toward known malicious IP addresses and URLs.

Enumeration Techniques
Unit 42 researchers identified one of TeamTNT’s malware repositories, hxxp://45.9.148[.]35/chimaera/sh/, which contained several
bash scripts designed to perform cryptojacking operations, exploitation, lateral movement and credential scraping operations, as
shown in Figure 1. This malware repository, referred to as the Chimaera Repository, highlights the expanding scope of TeamTNT
operations within cloud environments as well as a target set for current and future operations.

Figure 1. TeamTNT’s Chimaera Repository.

Within the Chimaera repository, there were three scripts that specifically highlight TeamTNT’s expanding cloud targeting capabilities
and intent. The first script is grab_aws-data.sh, (SHA256:
a1e9cd08073e4af3256b31e4b42f3aa69be40862b3988f964e96228f91236593), which focuses on enumerating AWS cloud
environments using known AWS IAM credentials. The second script, bd_aws.sh, (SHA256:
de3747a880c4b69ecaa92810f4aac20fe5f6d414d9ced29f1f7ebb82cd0f3945) scrapes all known Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) keys
from an AWS instance and identifies all executable programs currently running on that instance. Finally, the script search.sh
(SHA256: ed40bce040778e2227c869dac59f54c320944e19f77543954f40019e2f2b0c35) performs a search for configuration files
containing application credentials stored on a given host. These scripts are newly discovered and directly highlight the targeting of
cloud native applications within both AWS and Google Cloud environments.
Enumerating AWS Environments
The bash script, grab_aws-data.sh, contains 70 unique AWS CommandLine Interface (AWS CLI) commands designed to enumerate
seven AWS services, IAM configurations, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, support cases and direct connections, in addition to any
CloudTrail and CloudFormation operations available to a given AWS IAM credential. As seen in Figure 2, all enumerated values
obtained through the AWS enumeration process will be stored within the local directory /var/tmp/.../...TnT.../aws-account-data/ on the
compromised system.

Figure 2. TeamTNT’s grab_aws.sh

script.
Navigate to the Appendix for a list of all 70 unique AWS CLI commands present within the TeamTNT script grab_aws-data.sh. As a
summary, the TeamTNT script contained commands for the following seven AWS services:
44 EC2 instance commands.
14 IAM commands.
4 Direct Connect commands.
4 CloudFormation commands.
2 CloudTrail commands.
1 S3 command.
1 Support command.
Credential Scraping
TeamTNT actors have also expanded their credential scraping capabilities to include the identification and collection of 16 unique
applications, which may be present on the compromised cloud endpoint and for any of the known user accounts on the cloud
instance, including the root account. There has been additional research involving this particular script. These applications were listed
within the script search.sh:
SSH keys.
AWS keys.
Docker.
GitHub.
Shodan.
Ngrok.
Pidgin.
Filezilla.
Hexchat.
Google Cloud.
Project Jupyter.
Server Message Block (SMB) clients.
Several of these applications are noteworthy. The presence of Google Cloud credentials tops the list as this is the first known instance
of an attacker group targeting IAM credentials outside of AWS (see Figure 3). It is possible that Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud,
Oracle Cloud or IBM Cloud environments could be targeted using similar techniques, but Unit 42 researchers have yet to find
evidence of these CSPs being targeted. Researchers believe that it is only a matter of time before TeamTNT will develop functionality
similar to that of grab_aws-data.sh described above, but targeting Google Cloud environments.

Lateral Movement Operations
In addition to the 16 applications listed above, the following applications are specifically targeted for lateral movement operations.
Weaveworks
Within the search.sh script, there are several applications identified which display evolving attack patterns for TeamTNT operations.
Within the Chimaera repository, Unit 42 researchers identified several scripts that single out specific applications. One of those
applications is Weaveworks (see Figure 4). Weave is a microservice network mesh application developed for container infrastructures
such as Docker and Kubernetes, and allows for microservices to be running on one or multiple hosts while simultaneously
maintaining network connectivity. By targeting Weave installations, TeamTNT operations have the potential to move laterally within a
container infrastructure using the Weave network mesh application. As can be seen within the base64 encoded code in the script
setup_scope.sh, (SHA256: 584c6efed8bbce5f2c52a52099aafb723268df799f4d464bf5582a9ee83165c1), TeamTNT is targeting
Docker user accounts that contain Weave container information.

Project Jupyter

Additionally, the Project Jupyter application is listed as a target of TeamTNT operations through two sources within the Chimaera
repository, first within the search.sh script as the target for credential scraping, and as a beta lateral movement script,
spread_jupyter_tmp.sh (SHA256: 0d7912e62bc663c9ba6bff21ae809e458b227e3ceec0abac105d20d5dc533a22).
Unit 42 researchers also found reference to Project Jupyter within a known TeamTNT actor’s Twitter account. The Twitter account,
@HildeTnT, posted the following image (Figure 6) on their Twitter feed, replying to a potentially compromised Jupyter endpoint. The
German-language text translates to “Hahaha we take that as a compliment ^^ btw blocking the shell alone brings 0% security …” The
presence of this Twitter exchange highlights the fact that TeamTNT is actively using the scripts listed within the Chimaera repository
and targeting these additional cloud applications.

from a potentially compromised Jupyter endpoint.

Peirates
Unit 42 researchers have identified that TeamTNT actors are using the open source container and cloud penetration tool Peirates. As
seen in Figure 7, Peirates allows actors to perform several attack functions against AWS and Kubernetes instances. This tool could
enable TeamTNT actors to investigate and identify misconfigurations or potential vulnerabilities within Kubernetes and Cloud
environments and could allow TeamTNT to perform additional compromising actions against cloud infrastructure.

Monero Mining Operations
TeamTNT operations are still focused on cryptojacking. The previous sections presented the findings of new techniques used by
TeamTNT actors to expand their cryptojacking infrastructure. The following section will focus on the findings related to the processes
of mining applications TeamTNT uses to perform their cryptojacking operations.
Local Docker Image
Of interest is the script file docker.container.local.spread.txt, which lists the name of a local Docker image, as shown in Figure 8. The
Docker image is a local Docker image, meaning it is not hosted and downloaded from an external docker repository such as Docker
Hub. Researchers did search Docker Hub for the presence of this Docker image and none were found.
Figure 8. Contents of the
docker.container.local.spread.txt.
The Docker container is created to provide a host for TeamTNT’s Monero (XMR) mining operation. Shown in Figure 5, a Docker
image is created with the name mangletmpuser/fcminer. This image is then started and directed to navigate to the Chimaera
repository file setup_xmr.sh, (SHA256: 5ddd226d400cc0b49d0175ba06a7e55cb2f5e9586111464bcf7b3bd709417904), which will
initiate the Docker cryptomining process, using the open source XMRig application within a Docker container.
New Monero Wallet
Unit 42 researchers identified a new Monero wallet address that has never before been witnessed in relation to TeamTNT operations,
46EPFzvnX5GH61ejkPpNcRNm8kVjs8oHS9VwCkKRCrJX27XEW2y1NPLfSa54DGHxqnKfzDUVW1jzBfekk3hrCVCmAUrFd3H. This
Monero wallet address was associated with the Monero public mining pool pool.supportxmr[.]com:3333, as shown in Figure 9.
Figure
9. SupportXMR public mining pool configuration.In Figure 10, this mining pool address displays that the TeamTNT mining operation
has collected 6.52012192 Monero coins, which at the time of this writing equaled $1,788 USD. The mining operation was found to be
operating at 77.7KH/s, across eight mining workers at the time of this writing, and operations using this Monero wallet address have
continued for 114 days. At an operating speed of 77.7KH/s, this operation is considered to be a small mining operation for a group like
TeamTNT.

Conclusion
Given TeamTNT’s integration of tools such as Peirates, their targeting of cloud native network mesh applications such as Weave, their
operations around Kubernetes and Black-T, and their targeting and subsequent taunting of organizations using Project Jupyter,
TeamTNT actors are suspected to be employing all tools listed within this blog on a regular basis. TeamTNT actors are specifically
targeting cloud platforms in an attempt to circumvent future security detection tools and embed themselves into the organization’s
cloud environment.
We recommend that organizations operating with cloud environments monitor for and block all network connections associated with
TeamTNT’s Chimaera repository, as well as historic Command and Control (C2) endpoints. Using a cloud native security platform will
significantly reduce the cloud infrastructure’s attack surface and allow organizations to monitor for risks.
The following tips are highly recommended by Unit 42 researchers to assist in the protection of cloud infrastructure.
Enforce least-privilege IAM access policies to all cloud IAM roles and permissions. Where applicable, use short-lived or onetime-use IAM credentials for service accounts.
Monitor and block network traffic to known malicious endpoints.
Only deploy vetted container images within production environments.
Implement and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning platforms to prevent insecure cloud instances from being deployed
into production environments.
Use cloud infrastructure configuration scanning tools that enable governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) to
identify potentially threatening misconfigurations.
Use cloud endpoint agents to monitor and prevent the running of known malicious applications within cloud infrastructure.
Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud customers are protected from these threats through the Runtime Protection feature, Cryptominer
Detection feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance Protection, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes
configuration and provides secure alternatives. Additionally, Palo Alto Networks VM-Series and CN-Series products offer cloud
protections that can prevent network connections from cloud instances toward known malicious IP addresses and URLs.
