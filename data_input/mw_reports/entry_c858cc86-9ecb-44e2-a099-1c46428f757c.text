The threat to sensitive financial information is greater than ever. Data breaches, phishing attacks, and other
forms of information theft are all too common in today’s threat landscape. Point-of-sale systems and ATMs have
been targeted by hackers. Information-stealing trojans pose a risk to data and can lead to significant financial
loss.
Qakbot and Emotet are information stealers that have been showing renewed activity in recent months. These
malware families are technically different, but they share many similarities in behavior. They both have the
ultimate goal of stealing online banking credentials that malware operators can then use to steal money from
online banking accounts. They can also steal other sensitive information using techniques like keylogging.

Figure 1. Qakbot and Emotet monthly machine encounters show an upward trend. This data doesn’t include
Qakbot and Emotet variants blocked by automation and cloud rules.
Even though these malware families are typically known to target individual online banking users, more and more
enterprises, small and medium businesses, and other organizations have been affected by indiscriminate
infections.

Recent variants of these malware families have spreading capabilities, which can increase the chances of
multiple infections in corporate networks. They can also be spread by other malware during the lateral movement
stage of a cyberattack.

Typical Qakbot and Emotet kill chain
Over the years, the cybercriminals behind Qakbot and Emotet have improved the code behind their malware.
They have evolved to evade detection, stay under the radar longer, and increase the chances of spreading to
other potential victims.
We mapped some of the common behaviors we’ve seen in Qakbot and Emotet variants and see a lot of
similarities.

Figure 3. Qakbot and Emotet attack kill chain. Note that some Qakbot and Emotet variants might not exhibit all of
the behaviors above and might be capable of unique routines.
Because of similarities in behavior, Qakbot and Emotet can be mitigated by similar security measures.

Steps to mitigate Qakbot and Emotet
Based on our experience helping organizations get rid of Qakbot and Emotet, the following steps mitigate
infection and ultimately remove the said malware from corporate networks:

3/10

1. Stop the spread of malware and cut off communication with its command-and-control

server
Cut off Internet access or disconnect the affected machines from the network until they have been
cleaned. Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection customers can isolate affected machines
with one click. You can also block infected machines at the edge firewall, unplug machines from the
network, or create rules on Windows Defender Advanced Firewall (and push these out via Group
Policy Objects (GPO)).
Stop sharing folders that show signs of infection or set shared folders to read-only. Removing admin
shares is an option that should only be used as a last resort as this can cause other issues and hinder
management
Practice credential hygiene. Remove unnecessary privileges, or disable privileged accounts that have
been observed to spread malware using SMB.
2. Look for new service creations and scheduled tasks
Look for new service creations by tracking event ID 7045 in the system log. We’ve observed this
threat to create services with randomly generated number strings as the name and .exe name, but
cleans them up after.
You can look for new scheduled tasks using even ID 106 in the task schedule log or 7045 to track
down machines.
3. Remove Qakbot, Emotet, and other related malware
Obtain and submit samples to your antivirus vendor. Malware samples can be obtained by following
the scheduled tasks and reviewing the target binaries. For Microsoft customers, use the Windows
Defender Security Intelligence submission portal.
Deploy updated definitions as soon as your antivirus vendor has tested and released them. Enable
cloud-delivered protection to get the latest protection in real-time. Do a full scan on all affected
machines. For Windows Defender Antivirus customers, learn how to manage updates.
Uncover undetected variants by inspecting infected systems for scheduled tasks and their target
binaries. The Sysinternals Autoruns tool can be your friend here. Windows Defender ATP customers
can review the timeline of known affected machines to find undetected malware components.
Additional affected machines can be identified by reviewing the incident graph for the relevant alert or
by searching for threat known artifacts, such as file SHA1s, IP addresses, and URLs.
4. Monitor the network for possible reinfection
Determine and address the initial attack vector. Use security solutions like Windows Defender ATP,
which provides detailed timelines and other contextual information to understand the nature of attacks
and take response actions.
Slowly reintroduce network connectivity to the subset of the machines that have been cleaned.
Monitor them for reinfection.
Reintroduce network connectivity to all affected machines that are believed to be clean.
Turn on real-time protection in your antivirus. In Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender
Antivirus for Windows 10, enable cloud-based protection and automatic sample submission. With
these features enabled, Windows Defender Antivirus provides advanced real-time protection against
never-before-seen threats.

Preventing Qakbot and Emotet infections with Windows 10

4/10

While the steps above can rid networks of Qakbot and Emotet, preventing infection eliminates opportunities for
these threats to steal info. Windows 10 S is a streamlined platform with Microsoft-verified security. It blocks
malware like Qakbot and Emotet and other malicious programs by working exclusively with apps from the
Windows Store, ensuring that only apps that went through the Store onboarding, vetting, and signing process are
allowed to run.
Additionally, Windows 10 has a comprehensive defense stack that can help block and detect malware like
Qakbot and Emotet.
Use Microsoft Edge to block Qakbot and Emotet infections from the web. Microsoft Edge opens pages within low
privilege app containers and uses reputation-based blocking of malicious downloads. Its click-to-run feature for
Flash can stop malware infections that begin with exploit kits. With Windows Defender Application Guard,
Microsoft Edge has an additional hardware isolation-level capability on top of its exploit mitigation and sandbox
features.
Block malicious emails carrying trojan droppers that install Qakbot and Emotet using Microsoft Exchange Online
Protection (EOP), which has built-in anti-spam filtering capabilities that help protect Office 365 customers. Secure
mailboxes against email attacks with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, which blocks unsafe attachments,
malicious links, and linked-to files leveraging time-of-click protection. Outlook.com anti-spam filters also provide
protection against malicious emails.
Enable Windows Defender Exploit Guard to block malicious documents (such as those that use macro code to
install Qakbot and Emotet, or the more recent DDEDownloader that install other malware) and scripts. The Attack
Surface Reduction (ASR) feature in Windows Defender Exploit Guard uses a set of built-in intelligence that can
block malicious behaviors observed in malicious documents. ASR rules can also be turned on to block malicious
attachments from being run or launched from Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo).
Use Credential Guard to protect domain credentials and help stop malware from spreading using compromised
credentials.
Use Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to manage local account passwords and domain joined
computers.
Enable Windows Defender AV to detect Qakbot and Emotet variants, as well as all related malware such as
droppers and downloaders. Windows Defender AV uses precise machine learning models as well as generic and
heuristic techniques and enhanced behavior analysis to detect common and complex malware code. It provides
advanced real-time protection against new and unknown files using the Windows Defender AV cloud protection
service.
Use Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to flag Qakbot or Emotet infections and to enable security
operations personnel to stop the spread of these threats in the network. Windows Defender ATP’s enhanced
behavioral and machine learning detection libraries flag malicious behavior across the malware infection process,
from delivery and installation, to persistence mechanisms, command-and-control communication, and lateral
movement. The new process tree visualization and improvements in machine isolation further help security
operations to investigate and respond to attacks.
To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced
attacks, sign up for a free trial.

These end-to-end security features in Windows 10 help defend against increasingly complex malware attacks. At
Microsoft, we continue to harden Windows 10 against attacks. With Fall Creators Update, we shipped several
new and enhanced security features that make Windows 10 the most secure version of Windows yet. Learn more
about these features:
It is also important for organizations to augment these security technologies with a security-aware workforce.
Educating employees on social engineering attacks and internet safety, and training them to report suspicious
emails or websites can go a long way in protecting networks against cyberattacks.
