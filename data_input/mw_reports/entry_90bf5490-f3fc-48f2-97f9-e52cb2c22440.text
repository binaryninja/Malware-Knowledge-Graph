The actors behind the Maze Ransomware have released 2GB of files that were allegedly
stolen from the City of Pensacola during their ransomware attack.
Earlier this month, the City of Pensacola was hit with a ransomware attack that impacted
the city's email service, some phone service, and caused them to shut down their computer
systems.
It was later confirmed by BleepingComputer that they were attacked by the Maze
Ransomware who stated they stole data from the city before encrypting the network. They
then demanded a $1 million ransom to decrypt their files.
Yesterday, the Maze actors released 2GB of the 32GB of files that they state they stole from
the city before encrypting the network.

Alleged Proofs of Stolen Data
In a discussion with BleepingComputer, the Maze actors stated that they released the
stolen data to prove to the media that they steal more than just a few files during a
ransomware attack.
"This the fault of mass media who writes that we don't exfiltrate data more than a few files.
We did not want to make a pressure on city, we still dont make it right now. We've shown
that our intentions are real."
When BleepingComputer asked if they intended to release the rest of the data, they
responded with "It depends".
BleepingComputer has also contacted the City of Pensacola, but have not heard back as of
yet.
