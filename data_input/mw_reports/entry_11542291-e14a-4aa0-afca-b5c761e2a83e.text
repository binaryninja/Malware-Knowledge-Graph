Making victims pay, infostealer malwares mimick piratedsoftware download sites
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/making-victims-pay-infostealer-malwares-mimick-pirated-software-download

Summary:
Threat actors distributing infostealers are gaining momentum by targeting victims seeking to
illegally download pirated software. Because obtaining and using pirated software is against
the law, many individuals partaking in this type of behavior suspend proper scrutiny for the
source of their download. As a result, whether they are good or bad people, victims across
the world are paying the price with their private information for a single bad decision.
Discover the techniques being used to distribute these threats and unravel the infection
chain from two different examples to understand how these malware developers operate
and use the latest techniques to avoid detection.

Introduction:
It has been over 20 years since the launch of Napster taught the internet how to get and
share digital content online, and nearly a decade since the resilient Pirate Bay torrent site
began enabling visitors to find and download stolen media and unlocked or ‘cracked’
versions of software. All these years later, in spite of many lawsuits and injunctions it is still
extremely common for people to download pirated software from shady shareware sites
instead of buying licenses for noncommercial purposes. Today, we typically see sites
hosting cracked softwares like Microsoft Office and Windows installers appearing in indexed
Google search results and ad banners.

Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers discovered multiple ongoing threat
campaigns distributing info-stealer malware by targeting victims trying to download pirated
software applications. The screenshot in Fig. 1 shows Google search results featuring these
fake sites that look just like the real pirate hosting sites. Part of what makes this type of
threat so successful is that it targets individuals participating in an illegal yet common
activity, as such many of the users can’t identify the intent behind one makeshift pop-up site
peddling illegal software downloads vs. another one hosting malware downloads. The
sections that follow provide a detailed technical analysis of two different active infostealer
infection chains that fall into this category.

Technical Analysis Case 1
Stage 1: Redirection and Infostealer Malware Distribution
When users visit fake shareware sites and click to download, they immediately experience
multiple redirects that obfuscate the process for detection by search engines, scanners, and
victims, and finally deliver them to a malicious site hosting the threat actor’s intended
content - an infostealer malware like the one featured in Fig 2 below. While this process
may raise eyebrows on a verified site, visitors on these back channel sites may assume that
this sleight-of-hand is a normal part of how shareware sites operate.

2/22

Fig 2. Infection vector
After arriving at the final destination and finishing the download, the final payload received
in this sample is a zip archive file <10 MB in size. In this case, the malware-hosting URL is
an open directory containing more than 3000 malicious zip archive files masquerading as
common types of cracked software, as shown in the Fig 3 snippet below.

3/22

The malware distribution pattern our researchers observed is not consistent, but we did
discover that trusted sites like Mediafire as shown in Fig. 4 below, and Discord are also
being used to host malware in several different campaigns.

Stage 2: Loader
The downloaded file is a compressed archive file that contains a password-protected zip
archive and a text file disguised to contain stored passwords.

Fig 5. Password and Archive file
The password-protected zip file further contains a zip file named setup.zip of size 1.3 MB.
Extracting the zip archive reveals a 0x20 and 0x00 byte padded executable file just over600
MB in size as shown in Fig. 5 below.

Fig 5. File padded with irrelevant bytes

5/22

ThreatLabz researchers found that the padded bytes were irrelevant to running the sample
file and determined that threat actor included them to evade detection by security engines.
The file also contains Anti-VM and Anti-Debug checks. Following this the dumping process
removes irrelevant bytes dropping the file size in this sample down from 600MB to 78 KB,
as shown in Fig 6 below.

Fig 6: Actual file size after dumping the process
Once the file is executed it spawns an encoded PowerShell command that launches a
cmd.exe process with a timeout of 10 secs. This timeout period is added for evading
automated sandbox analysis tools. The decoded PowerShell command looks like this:
(Start-Sleep-s10;Remove-Item-Path"C:\Users\User\Desktop\Setupfinal.exe"-Force)
Once the timeout period is over the loader connects to the remote server requesting a jpg
file named ‘windows.decoder.manager.form.fallout15_Uwifqzjw.jpg’, as shown in Fig. 7
below.

Fig 7: Loader downloading requested jpg file from the remote server
The downloaded jpg file looks like it is encrypted but opening it with an editor reveals that
the contents are simply stored in reverse order and once the content is reversed by the
malicious program, it transforms into a DLL file.

Stage 3: Redline Stealer
The DLL payload contains a RedLine Stealer malware that targets your stored browser
history, it is obfuscated with a crypter and compiled into memory by the loader. The loader
loads the DLL and replaces it with the current thread context.
This RedLine Stealer sample is designed to steal stored browser passwords, auto-complete
data including credit card information, and cryptocurrency files and wallets. The implications
for an unsuspecting victim trying to save money on a program they may barely intend to use
can be severe resulting in financial losses, identity theft, and other forms of fraud and
extortion.

Technical Analysis Case 2
ThreatLabz researchers also observed fake shareware sites distributing instances of the
RecordBreaker Stealer malware delivered without the use of any legitimate file hosting
services by instead using malware packer tools like Themida, VMprotect, and MPRESS, as
found in the sample packed with Themida shown in Fig. 8 below.

7/22

Fig 8: Files packed with Themida/VMprotect
Malware authors typically use packers and protectors for compression and to wrap the
software in an extra layer of disguised code to evade detection. Packers are also growing in
popularity for the anti-VM and anti-debugging techniques they offer which allow the
malware to effectively navigate the system, avoid detection, and run more smoothly, as
shown in the screenshots featured in Fig. 9-10 below.

After execution, the malware in this sample communicates with the C2 server and sends
back the machine ID and config ID before downloading its required libraries from the remote
server.

extensions, including: MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Ronin, MetaMask, MetaX,
XDEFI, WavesKeeper, Solflare, Rabby, CyanoWallet, Coinbase, AuroWallet, KHC, TezBox,
Coin98, Temple, ICONex, Sollet, CloverWallet, PolymeshWallet, NeoLine, Keplr,
TerraStation, Liquality, SaturnWallet, GuildWallet, Phantom, TronLink, Brave, MetaMask,

Conclusion:
This campaign highlights how attackers take advantage of users’ behavior through the
distribution of pirated software to spread infostealer malware and extort victims for financial
profits and other gains. The campaigns analyzed in this article depend on users visiting
and downloading software from unscrupulous websites as the initial infection vector, users
can easily prevent these unfortunate infections by avoiding this illegal practice and only
visiting legitimate sites and downloading software from trustworthy sources.

Best Practices:
Avoid visiting untrusted sites including those that host pirated software
Do not install pirated software on your device
Enable policy to block password-protected files
Do not save credentials in the browser
