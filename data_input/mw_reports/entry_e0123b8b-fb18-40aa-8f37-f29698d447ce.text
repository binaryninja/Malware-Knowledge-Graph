Industroyer is the first ever malware specifically designed to attack power grids. This unique
and extremely dangerous malware framework was involved in the December 2016 blackout
in Ukraine. What sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure, such as
BlackEnergy (a.k.a. SandWorm), is its ability to control switches and circuit breakers directly
via four different industrial communication protocols.
Our talk will cover a detailed analysis of Industroyer's malicious payloads that directly
interfere with the targeted industrial control systems, as well as supporting modules
responsible for command & control communication, persistence, and so on.
In addition to explaining why Industroyer can be considered the biggest threat to industrial
control systems since the infamous Stuxnet worm, we will take a look at the 2016 power
outage in the context of the other numerous cyber attacks against Ukrainian critical
infrastructure in the recent years, some of which were covered in our previous Virus Bulletin
talks.
We will also assess the attackers' motivations and what this threat means to utilities around
the world. As the protocols and hardware targeted by Industroyer are employed in power
supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure
systems, like water and gas, worldwide, the malware can be re-purposed to target vital
services in other countries. This discovery should serve as a wake-up call for those
responsible for the security of these critical systems.
