by ASERT Team on December 5th, 2018

Executive Summary
ASERT has learned of an APT campaign, possibly originating from DPRK, we are calling STOLEN PENCIL that is targeting academic
institutions since at least May 2018. The ultimate motivation behind the attacks is unclear, but the threat actors are adept at scavenging for
credentials. Targets are sent spear phishing e-mails that lead them to a web site displaying a lure document and are immediately prompted to
install a malicious Google Chrome extension. Once gaining a foothold, the threat actors use off-the-shelf tools to ensure persistence,
including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain access.
NOTE: NetScout AED/APS enterprise security products detect, and block activity related to STOLEN PENCIL using our ATLAS Intelligence
Feed (AIF).

Key Findings
A wide variety of phishing domains imply other targets, but those focused on academia were intended to install a malicious Chrome
extension.
A large number of the victims, across multiple universities, had expertise in biomedical engineering, possibly suggesting a motivation for
the attackers targeting.
Poor OPSEC led to users finding open web browsers in Korean, English-to-Korean translators open, and keyboards switched to Korean
.
The threat actors use built-in Windows administration tools and commercial off-the-shelf software to “live off the land”. The threat actor
at the keyboard uses RDP to access compromised systems rather than a backdoor or Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
Post-exploitation persistence is maintained by harvesting passwords from a wide variety of sources such as process memory, web
browsers, network sniffing, and keyloggers.
There is no evidence of data theft, leaving the motivation behind STOLEN PENCIL largely uncertain.

Spear Phishing
Threat Chain

In keeping with tried and true tactics, the operators behind the STOLEN PENCIL campaign used spearphishing as their initial intrusion vector (left Figure 1). First reported by Twitter user @MD0ugh, a target of
STOLEN PENCIL receives a spear-phishing message containing a link to one of several domains controlled
by the threat actor. We’ve identified several domains used for phishing (below). client-message[.]com
world-paper[.]net
docsdriver[.]com
grsvps[.]com
coreytrevathan[.]com
gworldtech[.]com
In addition to the Top-Level Domains (TLDs), we’ve uncovered a number of sub-domains used by the actors
(below):
aswewd.docsdriver[.]com
facebook.docsdriver[.]com
falken.docsdriver[.]com
finder.docsdriver[.]com
government.docsdriver[.]com
keishancowan.docsdriver[.]com
korean-summit.docsdriver[.]com
mofa.docsdriver[.]com
northkorea.docsdriver[.]com
o365.docsdriver[.]com
observatoireplurilinguisnorthkorea.docsdriver[.]com
oodwd.docsdriver[.]com
twitter.docsdriver[.]com
whois.docsdriver[.]com
www.docsdriver[.]com

Many of the subdomains contain basic phishing pages, consisting of saved HTML of common web login properties. Some of the pages
contain the “MarkOfTheWeb” artifact inserted by the web browser when the threat actor clicked “Save As” on the page they intend to
impersonate. RiskIQ discussed this technique, although we do not believe the campaigns are related. The more sophisticated phishing pages

targeting academia display a benign PDF in an IFRAME. It then redirects the user to install a “Font Manager” extension from the Chrome
Web Store, as seen in Figure 2.
HTML Source of Phishing Page

Figure 2: HTML Source of Phishing Page The malicious extensions, now removed from the Chrome Web Store, contain reviews left by the
threat actor using compromised Google+ accounts. The text of the reviews were copy/pasted from other extensions and were all rated “fivestars”, even if the copied text was negative. It’s likely the compromised accounts used to leave reviews were from individuals the threat actors
assume the target would know and trust. It should be noted however, that some users reported deleting the extension immediately because it
prevented the Chrome browser from functioning properly. This could suggest mistakes or poorly written code that utilized too many
resources to remain functional and stealthy, at least for some users. The malicious Chrome extensions declare permissions to run on every
URL in the browser, as seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3: manifest.json with <all_urls> The extensions load JavaScript from a separate site, shown in Figure 4. The name of the loaded
JavaScript file is jQuery.js. When retrieving this file at the time of our analysis, the content was a legitimate jQuery file. We speculate that the
attacker replaced the malicious JavaScript with a benign payload to deter analysis. Loading jQuery.js from an external site makes no sense,
since the latest version of extension has a legitimate jQuery.js included in the extension bundle.

Figure 4: Given the threat actor’s propensity for password theft, and the fact that the malicious Chrome extensions were situated to read data
from every website, it's likely that the intent is to steal browser cookies and passwords. Email forwarding was also observed on some
compromised accounts. While GDPR requirements prevented us from pivoting on Registrant information, the actors reused IP space, reused
a certificate, and the aforementioned domain mimicking technique allowed for some pivoting. A variety of infrastructure was discovered.
Those IOCs are included below.

Toolset
Once gaining a foothold on a user’s system, the threat actors behind STOLEN PENCIL use Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for
remote point-and-click access. This means a human is behind the keyboard interacting with a compromised system, and not using a RAT
(Remote Access Trojan) with a command-and-control site acting as a proxy between the threat actor and the compromised system. RDP
access occurred daily from 06:00-09:00 UTC (01:00-04:00 EST). In one case, we noted that the threat actor changed the victim’s keyboard
layout to Korean. A compromised or stolen certificate was used to sign several PE files used in STOLEN PENCIL for two sets of tools:

MECHANICAL
Logs keystrokes to %userprofile%\appdata\roaming\apach.{txt,log} and also functions as a “cryptojacker” that replaces Ethereum
wallet addresses with 0x33883E87807d6e71fDc24968cefc9b0d10aC214E. This Ethereum wallet address currently has a zero
balance and no transactions.
GREASE
a tool to add a Windows administrator account with a specific username/password and enable RDP, circumventing any firewall
rules. We’ve observed the following list of username/password combinations, though the significance of “1215” is unknown:
LocalAdmin/Security1215!
dieadmin1/waldo1215!
dnsadmin/waldo1215!
DefaultAccounts/Security1215!
defaultes/1qaz2wsx#EDC
The certificate chain used in the majority of both MECHANICAL and GREASE samples is shown in Figure 5.

Certificate used to sign MECHANICAL/GREASE

Figure 5:

Certificate used to sign MECHANICAL/GREASE While the threat actors did use a few tools to automate intrusions, we also found a ZIP
archive of tools that demonstrate their propensity for password theft to propagate. Inside the archive we found the following tools:
KPortScan – a GUI-based portscanner
PsExec – a tool to remotely execute commands on Windows systems
Batch files for enabling RDP and bypassing firewall rules
Procdump – a tool to dump process memory, along with a batch file to dump the lsass process for password extraction
Mimikatz – a tool to dump passwords and hashes
The Eternal suite of exploits, along with batch files for rapid scanning and exploitation
Nirsoft Mail PassView – a tool to dump saved mail passwords
Nirsoft Network Password Recovery – a tool to dump saved Windows password
Nirsoft Remote Desktop PassView – a tool to dump saved RDP passwords
Nirsoft SniffPass – a tool to sniff the network for passwords sent over insecure protocols
Nirsoft WebBrowserPassView – a tool to dump passwords stored in a variety of browsers
Clearly this toolset can be used to scavenge passwords stored in a wide array of locations. Using a combination of stolen passwords,
backdoor accounts, and a forced-open RDP service, the threat actors are likely to retain a foothold on a compromised system.

Recommendations
Advise users not to click on any suspicious links in an e-mail, both at work and at home, even if they are from people they trust.
Advise users to be wary of any prompts to install browser extensions, even if they are hosted on an official extension site.
Watch for e-mails containing links to the phishing domains.
Limit RDP access with a firewall to only those systems that require it. Monitor for suspicious RDP connections where there should be
none.
Look for suspicious, newly created administrative accounts.

Conclusion
While we were able to gain insight into the threat actor’s TTPs (Tools, Techniques, & Procedures) behind STOLEN PENCIL, this is clearly just
a small window into their activity. Their techniques are relatively basic, and much of their toolset consists of off-the-shelf programs and living
off the land. This, along with the presence of the cryptojacker, is typical of DPRK tradecraft. Additionally, the operators’ poor OPSEC
exposes their Korean language, in both viewed websites and keyboard selections. They spent significant time and resources doing
reconnaissance on their targets, as evidenced by the comments left on the Chrome extension page. Their main goal appears to be gaining
access to compromised accounts and systems via stolen credentials and holding on to it. We were not able to find any evidence of data theft
– their motives for targeting academia remains murky.
