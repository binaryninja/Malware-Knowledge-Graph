I got some malspam on 09/07/17 and decided to play around with it a bit. Below is an image
of the email:

The email is pretending to come from “Signa Air” and the subject is “Re: Details”. The text of
the email is as follows:
FYI,
I sent this earlier with my regular email but no reply from you.
Kindly crosscheck the account details in the attached due invoice to see if it
matches with yours.
Payment will be released this week.
Very truly yours,
Signa Air
2619 Coulter LaneProvidence Forge, VA 23140
Tel 631-232-8257
fax 631-232-6045

The email attempts to social engineer the user into opening the attached “invoice” contained
within “invoice_327504.zip”. Downloading and opening the attached zip file shows two files,
“invoice_327504” and “invoice_327504.doc”:

Opening invoice_327504.doc does what you might expect, social engineering unsuspecting
users into enabling editing and content:

Enable Content
The text of the document states:
Oops, something went wrong
This document is protected
1. Open the document in Microsoft Office. Previewing online is not available for
protected documents.
2. If this document was downloaded from your email, please click Enable Editing from
the yellow bar above.
3. Once you have enabled editing, please click Enable Content from the yellow bar
above.

Not surprisingly, there is an embedded macro in the file. The macro is executed when the
user opens the document and allows the macro to run. The VBA macro is also obfuscated,
which is done to evade detection and to make analysis more difficult.

We can see that it uses PowerShell to download and execute a remote file:

The script uses the argument -WindowStyle Hidden to hide the command window from the
user and downloads the malware payload from hxxp://85[.]143[.]175[.]128/file.exe. Below is
an image of the GET request performed by my host:

5/10

Notice the lack of request headers, including the nonexistent User-Agent.
The downloaded file is dropped in %TEMP% and renamed something like 21916.exe. Once
the payload is downloaded, the script uses the method Start-Process to run the additional
code.
After the malware payload is executed, we see the creation of various files in
%LOCALAPPDATA%, including “container.dat,” some .tmp files (deleted by malware), a .dll
file, “1.dat,” “2.dat,” extension-less files, and a .conf file:

The malware also sets an autostart registry key in
HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun (for persistence), pointing to the .dll
located in %LOCALAPPDATA%:

My Twitter friend @Antelox helped me out again (thanks!) with quickly identifying the
malware as CoreBot, a modular banking Trojan.
The malware sample also creates the following mutex:
18550D22-4FCA-4AF2-9E8E-F0259D23694F
During my infection I noticed the malware requesting the external IP address of the host via
httpbin[.]org/ip:

The User-Agent for these request were Wget/1.11.
There were also connections to 89.223.31.232 via TCP port 443:

After I posted the link to this blog post on Twitter @VK_Intel uploaded an image of the
config, which contains the domain name Checkbox.bit:
