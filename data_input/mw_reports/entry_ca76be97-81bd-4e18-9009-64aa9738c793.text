Operation PZCHAO
Inside a highly specialized espionage
infrastructure

Whitepaper

Foreword
More than 30 years after the end of the Cold War, digital infrastructures worldwide have become strategic national fronts with the same
importance as the geographical frontiers of air, land, sea and space.
At the same time, cyber-attacks are growing in complexity as threat actors divide payloads in multiple modules with highly specialized
uses to achieve a target’s compromise. The past few years have seen high-proﬁle cyber-attacks shift to damaging the targets’ digital
infrastructures to stealing highly sensitive data, silently monitoring the victim and constantly laying the ground for a new wave of attacks.
This is also the case of a custom-built piece of malware that we have been monitoring for several months as it wrought havoc in Asia. Our
threat intelligence systems picked up the ﬁrst indicators of compromise in July last year, and we have kept an eye on the threat ever since.
An interesting feature of this threat, which drew our team to the challenge of analyzing it, is that it features a network of malicious
subdomains, each one used for a speciﬁc task (download, upload, RAT related actions, malware DLL delivery). The payloads are diversiﬁed
and include capabilities to download and execute additional binary ﬁles, collect private information and remotely execute commands on
the system.
In the analysis process, we managed to retrieve the malware payloads hosted on one of the command and control servers along with
some statistics, such as the total number of downloads and logs containing the targeted victims. Among the most-downloaded malicious
ﬁles, we found variants of Gh0st RAT used in Iron Tiger APT operation. Interestingly enough, these new samples now connect to the new
attack infrastructure.

This whitepaper takes an in-depth look at the the attack chain, the infrastructure used by the threat actors, the malware subdomains they
control and the payloads delivered on the targeted systems, as well as other telltale signs about a possible return of the Iron Tiger APT.

1. Victimology
Since its debut, this malware has been targeting important institutions, mainly in Asia and the USA, the victims being part of Government
sector, Technology, Education and Telecommunications. This map offers a simpliﬁed view of the location and nature of the targets.

2. The attack chain
The initial point of compromise seems to be highly targeted spam messages with a malicious VBS ﬁle attached. The VBS script acts as a
downloader for further malicious payloads from a distribution server, as shown in the diagram below.
The distribution server has been resolved to an IP address located in South Korea as of July 17 2017, when we ﬁrst isolated the initial
payload. The IP address “125.7.152.55” hosts the “down.pzchao.com”. As shown in the diagram below, new components are downloaded
and executed on the compromised hosts in every stage of attack.

2.1. Overview of the malware delivery infrastructure
The threat actors behind the attack have control over ﬁve subdomains of the “pzchao.com” domain. Suggestively named, these domains
serve speciﬁc functionalities, such as upload, download and RAT related communication.

[3]

Whitepaper

2.2. The ﬁrst stage payload – “UP”

One sample we dug from the malware zoo has also been spotted in various regions in Asia. It consists of a self-extracting 7zip archive
(SFX) which, when extracted, writes two batch scripts (up.bat, new.bat) to disk and one legitimate application called curl.exe.

This payload is particular to Asia, as the messages that the SFX Install Script displays as part of the setup on the compromised system are
written in Chinese. The malicious batch scripts, along with the downloader tool, are dropped in the %systemroot%\\temp folder. The ﬁrst
bat script to run is “up.bat” and is set in the “RunProgram” variable.
2.2.1.

A closer look at up.bat

The install script in the self-extracting archive executes the ﬁrst batch script dropped on the system. This script called “up.bat” sits in the
temporary folder and serves four main purposes:
It renames the second batch script from tnew.bat to win32shell.bat;
-

Assigns system ﬁle attributes to it;

-

Modiﬁes its Access Control List (ACL) to be easily controlled;

Kills all scheduled tasks that might interfere with the sample. Some of these tasks include legitimate Adobe services
as well as legit security solutions like 360.;

[4]

Whitepaper

The new win32shell.bat script is subsequently scheduled to run as a task under the “Adobe Flash Updates” name every other day at 3 AM
with the “down” parameter. The task name disguise helps keep a low proﬁle and evade scrutiny in case of an investigation:
schtasks /create /tn “Adobe Flash Updaters” /tr “%systemroot%\temp\win32shell.bat down” /sc daily /mo 2 /st 03:00:00 /ru “”

2.2.2.

new.bat

The “new” batch script is used by the network’s operators as a downloader for additional companion tools, as well as to upload system
information (and other conﬁdential data) to a command and control server. The BAT ﬁle is saved in the %TEMP% folder as “win32shell.bat”.
2.2.3.

The upload server component – “up.pzchao”

During its execution, win32shell.bat contacts the command and control server at up.pzchao.com:864/install.asp? to send a ﬁngerprint of
the system. The information is passed along in a POST request made by another batch script ﬁle that is decrypted and dropped by win32.
shell.bat. This dropped batch script is called “360.bat” (most likely because of its resemblance to a highly popular security suite in China)
and sends information such as username, domain, MAC address, OS version and the RDP port 3389 status via a POST request to the /
install.asp script. The request is sent via the legitimate application curl.exe that gets extracted from the initial 7zip archive.

Once the script ﬁnishes proﬁling the infected device, it starts uploading conﬁdential information, such as passwords. Password achievement
is done via a Mimikatz implementation downloaded along with the rest of the ﬁles. This POST request containing the password is sent to
another server-side script, called /upload864. This information is scheduled for collection and exﬁltration every week at 3 AM.

[5]

Whitepaper

2.3. The Download Server – “down.pzchao”
Win32shell.bat contacts the download server at “down.pzchao.com” to request the four additional second-stage payloads that are
discussed in detail below.

[6]

Whitepaper

2.3.1.

Second stage payloads

The Bitcoin Miner
The ﬁrst payload deployed to the infected system is a self-extracting 7zip archive that drops a set of miner application tools for Bitcoin
mining. The original installation batch script ensures that the miner application works well so that it will kill all scheduled tasks (other
bitcoin mining applications) which may interfere with the running tool. Subsequently, it identiﬁes the operating system used and sets the
corresponding Bitcoin miner application into the %TEMP% system folder.

The script proceeds to create a service called named wmiapsrv.exe that runs a BitcoinMinerPooling Application. The wmiapsrv32/64.exe
is a fake application set as a service, which runs java.exe (the actual Bitcoin miner). The Bitcoin miner application (both 32-bit and 64-bit)
is renamed as java.exe and used for bitcoin mining every three weeks at 3 AM.

The Password Stealer
To harvest passwords from the target system, the malware deploys two versions of the Mimikatz password-scraping utility for both
operating system architectures (x86, x64). Mimikatz comes in a self-extracted 7zip archive also and, once extracted, it drops four distinct
ﬁles, called mimikatz.exe, mimilib.dll, mimidrv.sys, and pass.bat.
The batch script executes the Mimikatz binary. Once dumped, the conﬁdential information gets uploaded to the command and control
server at a later time.
The Remote Access Trojan component (Gh0st RAT)
The last payload downloaded is a slightly modiﬁed Gh0st RAT sample designed to act as a backdoor implant. Its behavior is very similar
to the versions detected in attacks associated with the Iron Tiger APT group. This executable represents the “dropper” - a Windows
application that contains all the code required to prepare a compromised host for installation of the Gh0st RAT server service. The binary
that is decrypted and dropped on the system is the same as the one that communicates with the attacker’s endpoint (also known as the
RAT client or the C2 controller) on startup and awaits further instructions.

[7]

Whitepaper

Once this service is installed on the targeted host, the system is completely compromised, as it has a vast array of espionage capabilities
(including Remote Terminal) that can be used to move laterally across the network. A list of main capabilities, along with a short description,
are shown below in Table 1.
Process Explorer

Listing of all active processes and opened windows

Keystroke Logger

Real-time and offline remote keystroke logging

Web Cam Eavesdropping

Live video feed of remote web camera, if available

Voice Monitoring

Remote listening using microphone if available

Session Management

Remote shutdown and reboot of host

Remote File Downloads

Ability to download binaries from the Internet to remote host

Remote Terminal

Fully functional remote shell

File Manager

Complete ﬁle explorer capabilities for local and remote hosts

The Gh0st architecture takes advantage of the ability to create custom Windows resources in a Windows binary. This mechanism is used
quite often by malware authors, as it is extremely convenient for attackers to create custom binaries for different targets.
Before installation of the main communication component, the dropper takes several actions on the infected system: it will ﬁrst call the
GetInputState() function that veriﬁes if there are mouse or keyboard messages in the calling thread’s queue being followed by calls to
PostThreadMessage() and GetMessage(). However, none of the return values of these called functions are processed, which is highly
speciﬁc to many of the versions of Gh0st RAT we have seen in the past.
The malware then searches inside its own binary for a string delimiter SSSSSSS, returning a string pointer to the beginning of the encrypted
conﬁguration string. The delimiter points to the beginning of the C2 hostname:port pairs. The application searches again for another string
delimiter AAAAAAA. This time the marker string points to the beginning of the encrypted server service name. If the conﬁguration strings
are not found, the application exits. The encrypted conﬁgurations previously located will be decrypted using AES.
It will then ensure that only one instance of the program runs at a given moment by checking for the presence of a particular mutex on the
system. Subsequently, the payload enables its automatic execution upon every system startup by adding the path of the executable in the
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” registry key.
It also registers itself as a system service by adding the following registry keys:
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wsfbpy sahblabg”
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Maobeu xqiyes”
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Wsfbpy sahblabg
ReleiceName = „Oracle.exe””
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Wsfbpy sahblabg
[8]

Whitepaper

ReleiceName = „Maobeu xqiyes””
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Maobeu xqiyes
ConnectGroup = „””
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Maobeu xqiyes
MarkTime = „2017-10-19 17:21”
These steps that the dropper follows to install the RAT server are contained within a try-except block, which makes any potential error
terminate the execution of the application.
Along with the server binary dropped on the system, a Visual Basic script (“jingtisanmenxiachuanxiao.vbs”) that is used for process cleanup is also written in the current folder.

The server’s binary gets extracted from its own resource section and is written to the \Windows\System32 folder with the name of the
installed service (“Oracle.exe”).

Finally, it calls StartService() to execute the second component , namely the RAT server that will have total control over the compromised
host from now on. It starts to communicate with the C2 servers and await instructions.
Until it checks in with its C2 controller, the RAT server searches for the encrypted conﬁguration buffer containing the C&Cs that will get
decrypted using an AES key derived from a hardcoded string “Mother360”. The C&C servers revealed after decryption are:
rat.pzchao.com – used for sending instructions
centuriosa.info – used for sending instructions
zl855.no-ip.info – used for requesting new conﬁguration ﬁle of the C2 servers
It will then set a Windows station, ﬁrst by saving the current station by calling GetProcessWindowStation() then creating a new one named
winsta0 by calling OpenWindowStation(). This happens because, according to MSDN, “Kernel objects are securable, while user objects
and GDI objects are not. Therefore, in order to provide additional security, user interface objects are managed using window stations
and desktops, which themselves are securable objects.”. It veriﬁes if an instance of this service is already running by checking if a global
instance variable is not “null”.
Next, the RAT calls a function that uses the decrypted conﬁguration data to populate the following ﬁelds: lpszHost, dwPort, lpszProxyHost,
dwProxyPort, lpszProxyUser, lpszProxyPass. If the proxy variables exist and are being populated, the socket used to connect to the C2
RAT client gets conﬁgured to use the PROXY_SOCKS conﬁg. To determine how long the server has been connected to the client, the return
value of the function GetTickCount() gets saved. The ﬁrst check-in to the client consists of a login token (TOKEN_LOGIN) that is followed
by the data encapsulated in a “LOGINDATA” structure. The attacker uses this initial information as a ﬁngerprint of the system, which proves
extremely useful in determining the importance of the infected target and its potential role on the network.
[9]

Whitepaper

Once the attacker receives the ﬁngerprint packet, it is decrypted and parsed. A new row is then added to the Connections tab grid of the
client interface and the details of the server host are populated in the appropriate ﬁelds. The number of active connections displayed on
the Connections tab grid status bar is incremented by 1.

Once the handshake is completed successfully with the client (C2), the RAT waits for commands. When a user of the C2 client needs to
perform an action on a server from a compromised host, a Command packet containing the highlighted capabilities is created and sent.
Another trick that helps the malware fly below the radar is to change the C2 address to localhost when the attacker is not using the
infrastructure.
The network communication between the Gh0st RAT C2 client and a compromised host (server) is AES encrypted using the same string
“Mother360” to derive the decryption key. The packets passed between the two endpoints consist of two ﬁelds, but lack the plaintext
header that was typical of Gh0st RAT in previous versions:
1. A four-byte integer that contains the size in bytes of the entire packet.
2. A variable-sized packet that contains the packet payload AES encrypted.
The client sends small requests - packets containing commands - and the server responds to those commands with the requested data.
The two endpoints communicate using a series of pre-deﬁned commands. After the four byte integer that represents the size, the ﬁrst
byte of the packet payload contains an operation code. There are three types of codes: Commands, Tokens, and Modes. In the source
code, these codes are contained in a large enum in a header ﬁle.


Command codes are sent by the attacker instructing the victim what to do. Examples:

COMMAND_WEBCAM
COMMAND_SCREEN_SPY
COMMAND_KEYBOARD
[10]

Whitepaper

COMMAND_AUDIO
COMMAND_SCREEN_BLOCK_INPUT
COMMAND_PSLIST



Token codes that are passed between the two endpoints to ensure a clear protocol of the data being sent. Examples:

TOKEN_LOGIN
TOKEN_DRIVE_LIST
TOKEN_FILE_LIST
TOKEN_FIRST_SCREEN
TOKEN_AUDIO_DATA


Mode codes are used to determine in what circumstances the actions will be executed and to respond to speciﬁc
action settings accordingly. Examples:

TRANSFER_MODE_NORMAL
TRANSFER_MODE_UPDATE
TRANSFER_MODE_CANCEL

All these capabilities leave no doubt about the tool’s initial purpose and reach into the compromised device. It allows a remote attacker to
take full control of the system, spy on the victims and exﬁltrate conﬁdential information easily.

The malware hosting infrastructure
3.1. The HTTP File Server

While analyzing the download URL down.pzchao.com , we realized that it runs on a HTTP ﬁle server and we managed to obtain a list of
all ﬁles hosted on it, including meta-information such as last modiﬁcation timestamps and number of downloads. A partial list of ﬁles
and the number of hits can be seen in the image below:

[11]

Whitepaper

Another interesting aspect is that attackers often reset the download counters along with the IP Logs that keep a record of the targeted
victims of different campaigns. As shown in the hit log above, the most-downloaded malicious modules are the SFX installer and the
Gh0st RAT backdoor. The statistics also show that the number of hits (and implicitly, the number of victims) is constantly increasing, as
per the graphic below:

3.1.1.

Backdoors

The malware server also hosts ﬁve payloads that act as backdoors on the targeted systems. All ﬁve payloads are versions of the Gh0st
RAT tool. Two of these (8060.exe and 8555-.exe) communicate with the same main C&C server rat.pzchao.com. What differs is that
the packets exchanged between the client and the server begin with a plaintext header “Spidern”, followed by the data packet that is
compressed using zlib.

The other two samples (9527.exe and 8555++.exe) communicate with other two servers that are part of the infrastructure dll.pzchao.
com ; 455.pzchao.com. These versions will download the RAT server from dll.pzchao.com.
[12]

Whitepaper

3.1.2.

YPrat

The download server also contains a Remote Access Trojan developed in Python (both client and server). This server is used to listen
for connections on the same IP but on a different port (444). Our analysis revealed that it has extra features, such as downloading and
uploading ﬁles on remote infected systems, as well as information harvesting. Judging by the small number of downloads, we presume
that this payload is currently undergoing testing.

3.1.3

Port Scanning Tools

Another category of tools hosted on the same server is port scanning applications, complemented by a set of IP logs passed as an
argument to the scanning tools. These logs feature a range of subnets, mainly located in Asia. They are contained within the IP logs,
which means that, prior to an infection, the attackers ﬁrst search for vulnerabilities to exploit on the targeted systems.

Conclusions
Even though the tools used in this particular attack are a few years old, they are battle-tested and more than suitable for future
attacks. The ability to download most of these for free on certain underground hacking forums decreases the cost of attack without
compromising on stealth or effectiveness. Usually, threat actors are constantly modifying these tools to make them suitable for their
targets they have in their crosshairs: governments or strategic institutions such as education, telecommunication and so on.
As described in this paper, this remote access Torjan’s espionage capabilities and extensive intelligence harvesting from victims turns it
into an extremely powerful tool that is very difﬁcult to identify. The C&C rotation during the Trojan’s lifecycle also helps evade detection at
the network level, while the impersonation of legitimate, known applications takes care of the rest.
