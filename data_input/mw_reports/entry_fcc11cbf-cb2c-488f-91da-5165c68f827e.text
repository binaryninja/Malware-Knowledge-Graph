ZeuS has a fairly large repertoire with proposed strategies to Scam to spread their trojan and
phishing attacks against banks, many companies and well known.
We have recently warned of a campaign Scam using as cover to the IRS, which has been
generating a long time but every so often is reactivated, forming a cycle that seeks to
disseminate criminal ZeuS and that holds for all strategies.
Now, once again active phishing campaign that involves Facebook.

Like other campaigns, the page's source code has injected a tag iframe, which in this case
redirects to hxxp://109.95.114.251/us01d/in.php.
This page (in.php) redirection to:
http://109.95.114.251/us01d/load.php
http://109.95.114.251/us01d/file.exe
http://109.95.114.251/us01d/xd/pdf.pdf
http://109.95.114.251/us01d/xd/sNode.php
From whom are trying to exploit some exploits: CVE-2007-5659, CVE-2008-2992, CVE2008-0015 and CVE-2009-0927.

This server is also currently serving another massive campaign, but spreading the trojan
ZeuS through a Scam IRS. In this case, just change the folder where the package is housed,
namely: hxxp://109.95.114.251/usa50/in.php
As we see, Zeus does not stop at his criminal career. In fact, there are also other campaigns
more active, such as those involving a phishing attack by hiding under the VISA logo.

are:
