DDG is a mining botnet mainly focusing on SSH, Redis databases and OrientDB database servers. We captured the first DDG
botnet on October 25, 2017, and subsequently released several reports. A recent report was released in 2018-06, which reflected
the newest version of DDG 3012 at that time.
This morning, we noticed that DDG version 3013 came out.
