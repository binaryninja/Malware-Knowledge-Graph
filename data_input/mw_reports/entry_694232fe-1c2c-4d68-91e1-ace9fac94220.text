The Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Shade malware encrypts the files on the user's computer and
makes them inaccessible. Using the ShadeDecryptor tool, you can try to decrypt files with
the following extensions:
xtbl
breaking_bad
ytbl
heisenberg
better_call_saul
los_pollos
da_vinci_code
magic_software_syndicate
windows10
windows8
no_more_ransom
tyson
crypted000007
crypted000078
dexter

The tool searches for the decryption key in its database. If the key is found in the database,
the files are decrypted. If the key is not in the databases, the tool sends a request to the
server for additional keys. This requires Internet access.
