Waterbug may have hijacked a separate espionage group’s
infrastructure during one attack against a Middle Eastern target.

1/12

The Waterbug espionage group (aka Turla) has continued to attack governments and
international organizations over the past eighteen months in a series of campaigns that have
featured a rapidly evolving toolset and, in one notable instance, the apparent hijacking of
another espionage group’s infrastructure.

Three waves of attacks
Recent Waterbug activity can be divided into three distinct campaigns, characterized by
differing toolsets. One campaign involved a new and previously unseen backdoor called
Neptun (Backdoor.Whisperer). Neptun is installed on Microsoft Exchange servers and is
designed to passively listen for commands from the attackers. This passive listening
capability makes the malware more difficult to detect. Neptun is also able to download
additional tools, upload stolen files, and execute shell commands. One attack during this
campaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known as
Crambus (aka OilRig, APT34).
A second campaign used Meterpreter, a publicly available backdoor along with two custom
loaders, a custom backdoor called photobased.dll, and a custom Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) backdoor. Waterbug has been using Meterpreter since at least early 2018 and, in this
campaign, used a modified version of Meterpreter, which was encoded and given a .wav
extension in order to disguise its true purpose.
The third campaign deployed a different custom RPC backdoor to that used in the second
campaign. This backdoor used code derived from the publicly available PowerShellRunner
tool to execute PowerShell scripts without using powershell.exe. This tool is designed to
bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage. Prior to execution, the
PowerShell scripts were stored Base64-encoded in the registry. This was probably done to
avoid them being written to the file system.

Retooled
Waterbug’s most recent campaigns have involved a swath of new tools including custom
malware, modified versions of publicly available hacking tools, and legitimate administration
tools. The group has also followed the current shift towards “living off the land,” making use
of PowerShell scripts and PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used for executing
processes on other systems.
Aside from new tools already mentioned above, Waterbug has also deployed:

A new custom dropper typically used to install Neptun as a service.
A custom hacking tool that combines four leaked Equation Group tools (EternalBlue,
EternalRomance, DoublePulsar, SMBTouch) into a single executable.
A USB data collecting tool that checks for a connected USB drive and steals certain file
types, encrypting them into a RAR file. It then uses WebDAV to upload to a Box cloud
drive.
Visual Basic scripts that perform system reconnaissance after initial infection and then
send information to Waterbug command and control (C&C) servers.
PowerShell scripts that perform system reconnaissance and credential theft from
Windows Credential Manager and then send this information back to Waterbug C&Cs.
Publicly available tools such as IntelliAdmin to execute RPC commands, SScan and
NBTScan for network reconnaissance, PsExec for execution and lateral movement,
and Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) for credential theft, and Certutil.exe to download and
decode remote files. These tools were identified being downloaded via Waterbug tools
or infrastructure.

Victims
These three recent Waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments
and international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the IT and education
sectors. Since early 2018, Waterbug has attacked 13 organizations across 10 different
countries:
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Latin American country
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Middle Eastern country
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a European country
The Ministry of the Interior of a South Asian country
Two unidentified government organizations in a Middle Eastern country
One unidentified government organization in a Southeast Asian country
A government office of a South Asian country based in another country
An information and communications technology organization in a Middle Eastern
country

Hijacked infrastructure
One of the most interesting things to occur during one of Waterbug’s recent campaigns was
that during an attack against one target in the Middle East, Waterbug appeared to hijack
infrastructure from the Crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware on to the
victim’s network. Press reports have linked Crambus and Waterbug to different nation states.
While it is possible that the two groups may have been collaborating, Symantec has found no
further evidence to support this. In all likelihood, Waterbug’s use of Crambus infrastructure
appears to have been a hostile takeover. Curiously though, Waterbug also compromised
other computers on the victim’s network using its own infrastructure.
During this attack, a customized variant of the publicly available hacking tool Mimikatz was
downloaded to a computer on the victim’s network from known Crambus-controlled network
infrastructure. Mimikatz was downloaded via the Powruner tool and the Poison Frog control
panel. Both the infrastructure and the Powruner tool have been publicly tied to Crambus by a
number of vendors. Both were also mentioned in recent leaks of documents tied to Crambus.
Symantec believes that the variant of Mimikatz used in this attack is unique to Waterbug. It
was heavily modified, with almost all original code stripped out aside from its
sekurlsa::logonpasswords credential stealing feature. Waterbug has frequently made
extensive modifications to publicly available tools, something Crambus is not well known for.
The variant of Mimikatz used was packed with a custom packing routine that has not been
seen before in any non-Waterbug malware. Waterbug used this same packer on a second
custom variant of Mimikatz and on a dropper for the group’s custom Neuron service
(Trojan.Cadanif). Its use in the dropper leads us to conclude that this custom packer is
exclusively used by Waterbug. Additionally, this version of Mimikatz was compiled using
Visual Studio and the publicly available bzip2 library which, although not unique, has been
used by other Waterbug tools previously.
Aside from the attack involving Crambus infrastructure, this sample of Mimikatz has only
been seen used in one other attack, against an education target in the UK in 2017. On that
occasion, Mimikatz was dropped by a known Waterbug tool.
In the case of the attack against the Middle Eastern target, Crambus was the first group to
compromise the victim’s network, with the earliest evidence of activity dating to November
2017. The first observed evidence of Waterbug activity came on January 11, 2018, when a
Waterbug-linked tool (a task scheduler named msfgi.exe) was dropped on to a computer on
5/12

the victim’s network. The next day, January 12, the aforementioned variant of Mimikatz was
downloaded to the same computer from a known Crambus C&C server. Two further
computers on the victim’s network were compromised with Waterbug tools on January 12,
but there is no evidence that Crambus infrastructure was used in these attacks. While one of
these computers had been previously compromised by Crambus, the other showed no signs
of Crambus intrusion.

Figure 2. Waterbug likely compromised the C&C network infrastructure of Crambus
Waterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018. On September 5,
2018, a similar Mimikatz variant was dropped by Waterbug’s Neptun backdoor onto another
computer on the network. At around the same time, other Waterbug malware was seen on
the victim’s network which communicated with known Waterbug C&C servers.
6/12

Finally, the issue was clouded further by the appearance of a legitimate systems
administration tool called IntelliAdmin on the victim’s network. This tool is known to have
been used by Crambus and was mentioned in the leak of Crambus documents. However, in
this case, IntelliAdmin was dropped by custom Waterbug backdoors, including the newly
identified Neptun backdoor, on computers that had not been affected by the Crambus
compromise.
The incident leaves many unanswered questions, chiefly relating to Waterbug’s motive for
using Crambus infrastructure. There are several possibilities:
1. False flag: Waterbug does have a track record of using false flag tactics to throw
investigators off the scent. However, if this was a genuine attempt at a false flag
operation, it begs the question of why it also used its own infrastructure to
communicate with other machines on the victim’s network, in addition to using tools
that could be traced back to Waterbug.
2. Means of intrusion: It is possible that Waterbug wanted to compromise the target
organization, found out that Crambus had already compromised its network, and
hijacked Crambus’s own infrastructure as a means of gaining access. Symantec did not
observe the initial access point and the close timeframe between Waterbug observed
activity on the victim’s network and its observed use of Crambus infrastructure
suggests that Waterbug may have used the Crambus infrastructure as an initial access
point.
3. Mimikatz variant belonged to Crambus: There is a possibility that the version of
Mimikatz downloaded by the Crambus infrastructure was actually developed by
Crambus. However, the compilation technique and the fact that the only other occasion
it was used was linked to Waterbug works against this hypothesis. The fact that
Waterbug also appeared on the victim’s network around the same time this version of
Mimikatz was downloaded would make it an unlikely coincidence if the tool did belong
to Crambus.
4. Opportunistic sowing of confusion: If a false flag operation wasn’t planned from the
start, it is possible that Waterbug discovered the Crambus intrusion while preparing its
attack and opportunistically used it in the hopes of sowing some confusion in the mind
of the victim or investigators. Based on recent leaks of Crambus internal documents, its
Poison Frog control panel is known to be vulnerable to compromise, meaning it may
have been a relatively trivial diversion on the part of Waterbug to hijack Crambus’s
infrastructure. A compromise conducted by one threat actor group through another's
infrastructure, or fourth party collections, has been previously discussed in a 2017
white paper by Kaspersky researchers.

Further campaigns

7/12

Waterbug has also mounted two other campaigns over the past year, each of which was
characterized by separate tools. These campaigns were wide ranging, hitting targets in
Europe, Latin America, and South Asia.
In the first campaign, Waterbug used two versions of a custom loader named javavs.exe (64bit) and javaws.exe (32-bit), to load a custom backdoor named PhotoBased.dll and run the
export function GetUpdate on the victim’s computers. The backdoor will modify the registry
for the Windows Media Player to store its C&C configuration. It also reconfigures the
Microsoft Sysinternals registry to prevent pop-ups when running the PsExec tool. The
backdoor has the capability to download and upload files, execute shell commands, and
update its configuration.
The javaws.exe loader is also used to run another loader named tasklistw.exe. This is used
by the attackers to decode and execute a series of malicious executables that download
Meterpreter to the infected computer.
The attackers also install another backdoor that runs a command shell via the named pipe
cmd_pipe. Both backdoors allow the attackers to execute various commands that provide full
control of the victim’s system. Waterbug also used an older version of PowerShell, likely to
avoid logging.
In the second campaign, Waterbug used an entirely different backdoor, named securlsa.chk.
This backdoor can receive commands through the RPC protocol. Its capabilities include:
Executing commands through cmd.exe with the output redirected into a temporary file
Reading the command output contained in the temporary file
Reading or writing arbitrary files
This RPC backdoor also included source code derived from the tool PowerShellRunner,
which allows a user to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe, therefore
the user may bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage.
While both campaigns involved distinct tools during the initial compromise phase, there were
also many similarities. Both were characterized by the use of a combination of custom
malware and publicly available tools. Also, during both campaigns Waterbug executed
multiple payloads nearly simultaneously, most likely to ensure overlapping access to the
network if defenders found and removed one of the backdoors.
Waterbug took several steps to avoid detection. It named Meterpreter as a WAV file type,
probably in the hope that this would not raise suspicions. The group also used GitHub as a
repository for tools that it downloaded post-compromise. This too was likely motivated by a
desire to evade detection, since GitHub is a widely trusted website. It used Certutil.exe to
download files from the repository, which is an application whitelist bypass technique for
remote downloads.

8/12

In one of these campaigns, Waterbug used a USB stealer that scans removable storage
devices to identify and collect files of interest. It then packages stolen files into a passwordprotected RAR archive. The malware then uses WebDAV to upload the RAR archive to a
Box account.

Unanswered questions
This is the first time Symantec has observed one targeted attack group seemingly hijack and
use the infrastructure of another group. However, it is still difficult to ascertain the motive
behind the attack. Whether Waterbug simply seized the opportunity to create confusion
about the attack or whether there was more strategic thinking involved remains unknown.
Waterbug’s ever-changing toolset demonstrates a high degree of adaptability by a group
determined to avoid detection by staying one step ahead of its targets. Frequent retooling
and a penchant for flirting with false flag tactics have made this group one of the most
challenging adversaries on the targeted attack landscape.
