August 22, 2022

Recently, a simple and short email with a suspicious RTF attachment that had been sent to a
telecommunications agency in South Asia caught the attention of FortiGuard Labs. The email
was disguised as having come from a Pakistan government division and delivered the
PivNoxy malware.
Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Parties: Windows users
Impact: Controls victim’s machine and collects sensitive information
Severity Level: Medium
This blog describes how the attack works, suggests who the threat actor behind the
operation might be, and details the techniques used by the attacker.

Attack Overview
1/12

The attack started with a simple email that included a bare document as an attachment:
Figure 1. Spearphishing email used in the attack
The attached doc file is in RTF format. It was generated using a tool called Royal Road, a
phishing “weaponizer” believed to be used by several Asia-based APT threat actors. Also
referred to as 8.t RTF exploit builder, Royal Road allows APT groups to create RTF files with
embedded objects that can exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word to infect targets. Some of
the known vulnerabilities that Royal Road supports include:
CVE-2017-11882 (Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability)
CVE-2018-0802 (Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability)
CVE-2018-0798 (Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability)
Opening the email attachment, “Please help to CHECK.doc,” opens a decoy Word
document. And at the same time, it exploits CVE-2018-0798 in the background. CVE-20180798 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft’s Equation Editor
(EQNEDT32). Microsoft released a fix for it on January 9, 2018. The fact that attackers are
still targeting this vulnerability highlights that not all organizations deploy critical patches or
upgrade to the latest software. The truth is that older vulnerabilities are still commonly and
successfully being exploited.

may be a result of the language not being supported by our test machine.
Once executed, the malicious document drops three files:
C:\\ProgramData\Cannon\Cannondriver.exe
C:\\ProgramData\Cannon\LBTServ.dll
C:\\ProgramData\Cannon\Microsoft.BT
Despite the deceptive file name, the Cannondriver.exe file is a legitimate Logitech file,
LBTWizGi.exe, with the description, “Logitech Bluetooth Wizard Host Process.” The
Cannondriver.exe is even digitally signed by a certificate issued to Logitech.
Figure 3. Legitimate version of Cannondriver.exe
On the other hand, the LBTServ.dll file is not digitally signed. This is where it gets interesting.
“Cannondriver.exe” is vulnerable to a DLL Search Order Hijacking attack that LBTServ.dll
takes advantage of. Take note that the “LBTServ.dll” sample used in this attack has a
compilation time of Sun July 18 02:04:24 2021 GMT. This means that this group created this
variant well before they needed to use it. It suggests they were either ready to attack their

2/12

target almost a year before or had started stockpiling an arsenal of malware ready to go at a
moment’s notice. Recent Chinoxy samples that stayed under the radar, but were uncovered
during our investigation, have similar compile times.
Figure 4. DLL Search Order Hijacking inside Cannondriver.exe
The figure above is part of the code found in Cannondriver.exe. Basically, it calls the export
named LGBT_Launch, which is found in LBTServ.dll.
Figure 5. Inside LBTServ.dll
After Cannondriver.exe loads the fake LBTServ.dll and calls the LGBT_Launch function, the
malicious function loads the other dropped file, Microsoft.BT, into memory and proceeds to
decrypt it. The attack chain is similar to that used by the Chinoxy backdoor, which also uses
Cannondriver.exe to load a malicious LBTServ.dll to deliver its payload.
However, this current variant sent to the telecommunication agency in South Asia delivers
the final payload a bit differently than its predecessors. Instead of LBTServ.dll containing the
final payload, it loads a shellcode from a separate file and injects itself into svchost.exe. It
then contacts instructor[.]giize[.]com, a dynamic DNS redirecting the connection to the
attacker’s IP where the payload is hosted. Unfortunately, a remote file was not available at
the time of this investigation. Luckily, a tweet by nao_sec identified PoisonIvy malware as the
payload.
Figure 6. Tweet by nao_sec on May 12, 2022
PoisonIvy is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has been around for over a decade. Also
known as Pivy, the RAT is distributed in underground forums and allows an attacker to take
control of a compromised machine and perform reconnaissance activities through its GUI.
FortiGuard Labs previously released a blog series detailing how PoisonIvy works:
The PoisonIvy RAT variant covered in those blogs performs lateral movement. As such, a
single infection by PoisonIvy can lead to information being lifted from a wide range of
machines in the affected organization.

The Quest to Reveal the Attacker’s Identify
Although PoisonIvy is known to have been used in targeted attacks, it’s not an easy task to
identify the attacker behind the operation targeting the telecommunication organization in
South Asia. This is due to the number of reported threat actors that use the RAT and its wide
availability.

Our curiosity about the attacker led to another LBTServ.dll (SHA2:
719f25e1fea12c8dc573e7161458ce7a5b6683dee3a49bb21a3ec838d0b35dd3), that was
submitted to VirusTotal from France in January 2022. This file is dropped by a file with SHA2:
cdf417e67b0aaf798ac7c0f9ccb8b5b21f09b408ee6748beea5e03e76902e7fe.
Our analysis revealed that the file behaves similarly to the one in the email sent to the
targeted agency. It creates a folder (c:\windows\tasks) and drops config and PE files into it. A
dropped executable file, unio.exe, is identical to the legitimate signed Logitech file disguised
as Cannondriver.exe, described earlier in this blog. The unio.exe loads one of the other
dropped files in the attack we are investigating, LBTServ.dll. In this case, LBTServ.dll
contains the full backdoor payload instead of loading a shellcode to download it. This
LBTServ.dll file also takes advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking, has eight fake exports,
and has a malicious export also named LGBT_Launch. This led us to believe that both
attacks most likely came from the threat actor but in a different campaign that likely occurred
in January 2022 based on the file submission date to VirusTotal.
More interestingly, the compilation time of
719f25e1fea12c8dc573e7161458ce7a5b6683dee3a49bb21a3ec838d0b35dd3 is “2016-0709 12:49:34 UTC” while the compilation time of its dropper (SHA2:
cdf417e67b0aaf798ac7c0f9ccb8b5b21f09b408ee6748beea5e03e76902e7fe) is about 29
seconds later, at 2016-07-09 13:18:11 UTC. These indicate this attacker group has been
active since at least mid-2016.

A Tale of PivNoxy and Chinoxy Puppeter
We will now look at a partial history of the techniques used by this threat actor. Specifically,
we will focus on their use of a file best described as the Logitech Bluetooth Wizard Host
Process. This legitimately signed file contains a DLL Search Order hijacking vulnerability.
The APT group takes advantage of this vulnerability by creating their own malicious
“LBTServ.dll” file to be loaded whenever the real Logitech process is executed. Over time,
this malicious DLL has evolved to use different techniques. The attack chain usually starts
with an email containing an attachment. The attachment itself contains an executable that,
when executed, drops the malicious DLL, the legitimate Logitech executable, and any
associated files used by the malware.
Below is a timeline of dropper malware used by the threat actor utilizing the technique
described above to deliver Chinoxy, PivNoxy, and recent Chinoxy variants.
Figure 7. Sample timeline of dropper malware based on file compilation time Note: Q1, Q2,
Q3, and Q4 refer to January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to
December, respectively.

4/12

As seen in the timeline, in Q3 of 2021, the threat actor switched their arsenal from PivNoxy
to a new variant of Chinoxy, which decrypts and loads shellcode from a file and downloads
the next payload. The switch from Chinoxy to PivNoxy occurred sometime in Q2 2020.
FortiGuard Labs has documented that from the middle of 2016 to the end of 2018,
“LBTServ.dll” was consistently used by the variant known as Chinoxy. In this form, the
malicious DLL loads an external configuration file named “k1.ini.”
Figure 8. The configuration file used by Chinoxy
This configuration file typically contains a base64 string, which turns out to be the C2 server
used by Chinoxy.
Figure 9. Base64 decoded value from the Chinoxy configuration file
The “Remark” field contains the approximate date of the attack. This Chinoxy DLL sample
(SHA2: 719f25e1fea12c8dc573e7161458ce7a5b6683dee3a49bb21a3ec838d0b35dd3),
according to its metadata, was compiled on Sat Jul 09 12:49:34 2016 GMT. The main
dropper (SHA2:
cdf417e67b0aaf798ac7c0f9ccb8b5b21f09b408ee6748beea5e03e76902e7fe) itself was
compiled on 2016-07-09 13:18:11 GMT. The turnaround time appears to have only been a
few days. Chinoxy operated as a backdoor and collected data from the infected computers. It
is interesting to note that the same C2 server was used for over two years. Our telemetry
indicates that an overwhelming majority of the traffic to this server originated from India.
Things stayed relatively quiet until the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 when the group
decided to return. Operation Nightscout started targeting gamers in Southeast Asia.
NoxPlayer is an Android emulator and, like many programs, contacts servers to check for
updates. Instead of delivering their malware through email attachments, however, the APT
group changed tactics and somehow compromised the update chain of NoxPlayer. A fake
update package was sent to Southeast Asian gamers.
Similar to the Chinoxy case, this PivNoxy variant (SHA2:
5c2a6b11d876c5bad520ff9e79be44dfbb05ee6a6ff300e8427deab35085bef6) uses a fake
update package to unpack several files, including files that abuse the same DLL Search
Order Hijacking technique used against Logitech. However, in this case, “LBTServ.dll” was
used to deliver malware more powerful than the previous iteration, with PivNoxy delivering
the PoisonIvy RAT through the malicious DLL. While other vendors report infected computers
were gamers from Southeast Asia, our telemetry suggests more infected gamers originated
from Mexico.
At this point, this threat actor once again decided to go quiet. But fast forward to May 2022,
and the spearphishing email disguised to come from a governmental division of Pakistan
was sent to a telecommunication organization in South Asia. And this time, it attempted to
5/12

deliver a new Chinoxy malware variant.

Regional Interest
The dropper malware covered earlier in this blog (SHA2:
cdf417e67b0aaf798ac7c0f9ccb8b5b21f09b408ee6748beea5e03e76902e7fe) reaches out to
goog1eupdate[.]com. Based on FortiGuard telemetry gathered over the past six months,
almost 70% of the connections to the domain were made from Mexico, followed by 22% from
India. Chinoxy variants also used this domain from 2016 to 2018.
We also found three similar samples connect to frontbeauty[.]dynamic-dns[.]net,
beautygirl[.]dynamic-dns[.]net, and 784kjsuj[.]dynamic-dns[.]net. Over the same past six
months, all access to the three domains was made from India. As they are dynamic DNS, not
all connections can be considered related to the threat actor. However, a Bitdefender report
published in November 2020 references the domain “goog1eupdate[.]com” as part of the
IOCs for an APT group that uses the FunnyDream backdoor as part of their toolset and who
primarily targeted South-Eastern Asia. Access to another C2 address, “mfaupdate[.]com”,
was mainly observed from Mexico and India, while “ru[.]mst[.]dns-cloud[.]net” was primarily
accessed from Israel and Ukraine. According to security researcher Sebastien Larinier,
ru[.]mst[.]dns-cloud[.]net was used by a threat actor who targeted Kirghizstan. Further, a
research blog released by NTT Security lists another C2 server, “eofficeupdating[.]com“, as
being used by this threat actor as a C2 server for Smanager malware, which was used
against Vietnam. NTT Security attributed Smanager to an unknown Panda group. Panda is
typically part of the monikers used by Chinese threat actors, such as Deep Panda and
Goblin Panda.
This evidence indicates that the threat group we are after has a particular interest not only in
South-East Asia but also in South and Central Asia and potentially Mexico. Or at the least,
they have a relationship with an attacker with interests there.

Conclusion
The attack against a telecommunications agency in South Asia began with a simple email
that initially appeared to be a standard malicious spam email message. However, the
attached Word doc was weaponized using a malicious tool, Royal Road, and is equipped
with an exploit for an Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2018-0798). While a payload was
unavailable at the time of the investigation, OSINT research points to the Poison Ivy RAT,
which FortiGuard Labs has previously highlighted.
Based on our analysis, Asian organizations, and potentially some in Mexico, were a
reconnaissance target of a threat actor that we believe was also involved in Operation
NightScout in 2021. This threat actor, who uses Chinoxy and PivNoxy in their arsenal, has
been active since at least mid-2016.

The FortiGuard Labs has released a new playbook on the threat malware family known as
“Chinoxy” and “PivNoxy” as part of our role in the Cyber Threat Alliance. For more
