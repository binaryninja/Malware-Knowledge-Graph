Most professionals within enterprise security have come across
‘Emotet'. As its history illustrates, the criminals behind Emotet malware
are cunning and quick to maximize its ‘potential.' From a basic banking
Trojan to a threat distribution service, it is constantly being re-invented.
This ‘constant malware improvement’ isn’t showing any sign of abating.
Recently the Spamhaus Malware Labs team have identified further
unsettling changes in Emotet.
Emotet - what is it?

As previously mentioned, this malware came to the fore as a basic selfpropagating banking Trojan in 2014. However, over the past 5 years
the creators of this malware have taken the most successful facets of
other disruptive software and created a modular malware family that
can evade detection, spread like wildfire across a network and deliver
multiple payloads.
Only a year ago Allentown, USA, hit the news headlines after
becoming infected with Emotet. The remediation costs were reported
to be in the region of US $1million.
Emotet - the data
In the last two months alone, the researchers at Spamhaus Malware
Labs have tracked approximately 47,000 Emotet infected machines
emitting around 6,000 distinct URLs to compromised websites serving
as infection vectors. This makes Emotet the most actively distributed
malware at the moment, accounting for almost 45% the total number of
URLs used for this purpose.
There is no sign that the numbers associated with Emotet will decline
over the forthcoming months, particularly given a recent discovery that
will make Emotet even more difficult to detect.

HTTP Headers - Previously, Emotet built moderately primitive HTTP
packets. The fact they were primitive was a good thing; these HTTP
packets didn’t follow the standard protocol for either the type of data or
how the data was sent. This made them easy to detect using a static
signature on network traffic.

Emotet HTTP packet
Unfortunately, these HTTP packets have become increasingly
sophisticated: now they predominantly follow the RFC (Request for
Comments) specifications of the HTTP protocol. These additional
details in Emotet's HTTP headers give the appearance of coming from
a legitimate request, e.g., a browser or other application. As a result, a
static signature on network traffic won’t detect them, which is far from
ideal.

Adding HTTP headers
Uniform Resource Identifier inclusion - Not only do we have the
addition of these extra headers (as illustrated above), but Emotet has
also started to include a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). In the past,
a URI was missing, but now it is randomizing between two different
words. The URI randomly generates from a list of hardcoded comma
separated words, as you can see in the example below.

It is worth noting that while Emotet’s HTTP headers have changed the
layer below, i.e., the custom protocol remains unchanged, as this
image illustrates.

Protect yourself
The creators of Emotet have been savvy, and while nothing they have
done is rocket science, there is clear evidence that they have a strong
desire to make this malware more evasive and bulletproof. Which in
turn means that you need to have bulletproof security.
