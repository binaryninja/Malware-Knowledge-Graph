Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.
We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.
Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.
In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.
Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?

1/4

Redline Stealer malware impacting a customer in the software industry.
The malware was disguised as an installer for a photo editing software and was
inadvertently executed by the user.
When executed, the fake installer communicated with the command-and-control,
performed anti-analysis checks and then injected code into the legitimate Windows
binary MSBuild.exe using the process hollowing technique. Using the hollowed
process, the malware retrieves additional files hosted on the Discord chat service and
configures a scheduled task for persistence.

How did we find it?
eSentire MDR for Endpoint identified the process-hollowing activity.

What did we do?
Our 24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts investigated and confirmed the activity was malicious.
We also provided remediation recommendations and support to the customer.

What can you learn from this TRU positive?
eSentire has observed an increase in Redline Stealer infections since March 2022.
Redline Stealer is a general-purpose information stealer capable of collecting
credentials and sensitive data from compromised systems.
It was initially advertised on various hacking forums in early 2020 for $150 and $200
USD for a “lite” and pro version respectively (Figure 1).
Credentials stolen by information stealing malware can be used to further infiltrate
networks or monetized through sale on various underground markets.
It’s well-established that extortion groups such as LAPSUS$ use stolen
credentials or session cookies purchased from these markets.
According to Microsoft, LAPSUS$ has used Redline Stealer directly as part of
their initial access phase.

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
Protecting against information stealers requires a multi-layered defense approach to defend
endpoints from malware and detect or block unauthorized login activity against applications
and remote access services. Therefore, we recommend:
Protect all endpoints against malware.
Ensure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.
Use a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product
to detect and contain threats.
In the event information stealing malware is identified, reset user credentials and
terminate logon sessions.
Restrict access to enterprise applications from personal devices outside the scope of
security monitoring.
Ensure adequate logging is in place for remote access services such as VPN and use
modern authentication methods which support MFA and conditional access.

Ask Yourself...
Can you identify Redline Stealer in time to minimize credential compromise?
Do you have the visibility to identify use of compromised credentials in your
organization?
eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) is a world-class team of threat researchers who
develop new detections enriched by original threat intelligence and leverage new machine
learning models that correlate multi-signal data and automate rapid response to advanced
threats.
