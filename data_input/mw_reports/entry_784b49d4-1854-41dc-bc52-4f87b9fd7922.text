SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

THE POWER OF SHARING
Joe Levy, CTO, Sophos
“If you want to go quickly, go alone,
but if you want to go far, go together.”
This African proverb couldn’t ring truer for the cybersecurity industry. By working collectively, with a strong
sense of teamwork, we can achieve far more than fighting cybercrime as individual vendors.
But, only by improving our approach and sharing threat intelligence more comprehensively, and by
expanding the pool of participants who contribute to (and benefit from) this sharing and collaboration, will
cybersecurity vendors continue to drive up costs for attackers, and make lasting, impactful change.
In the spirit of that approach to working together, in 2017 Sophos joined the Cyber Threat Alliance, an
organization dedicated to breaking down the barriers that, for years, stymied any chance for competitors
in the information security industry to collaborate with one another. The CTA has succeeded far beyond its
initial mandate to serve as a repository of shared threat intelligence and a place to resolve differences, and
has become a sort of UN to the cybersecurity industry.
Through our partnership with the CTA, Sophos can better protect our customers, thanks to the early
warnings and data exchange between vendors, made possible by the alliance. Sophos also shares the
burden of protecting the other vendors’ customers by contributing our own threat intel.
In March 2020, as lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 were implemented rapidly across the
world, Sophos chief scientist, Joshua Saxe put out a call on Twitter. Appalled that criminal groups were
starting to incorporate references to COVID-19 into a range of crime campaigns, information security
analysts – more than 4,000 of them – banded together in a collective show of defiance and formed the
COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition (CCTC) in a Slack channel created that same day. This channel is building
an enduring “commons” for the community to leverage in times of crisis, and is close to achieving not-forprofit status under the auspices of the CTA.
Ultimately, these stories about sharing threat intelligence tell us about more than just the organizations
themselves. As another parable—that of the blind man and the elephant—teaches us, no one vendor can
provide comprehensive or absolute truth through their subjective experiences alone. The true shape of
complicated things emerges from the union of our experiences. These collaborative initiatives protected
millions of people from becoming victims of cybercrime, but that alone wasn’t why they were successful.
They thrived because the core motivation of their members and founders has been to, first, protect anyone
who might be in harm’s way from harm. There was no profit motive, just a desire to defend those in need,
while it seemed like the wolves were at the door.
This proves the model is correct, and bridges critical gaps in coverage none of us alone could generate, but
we can do more with it. As an industry, we may in the future want to consider sharing machine learning
models, or training datasets, just as we share block lists or Yara rules today. We could also strengthen
and contribute to emerging standards like STIX and the ATT&CK framework. And we could participate in
industry-specific ISACs and ISAOs.
The future will be more connected, and we’ll all be better off (and better protected) for it.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Sophos 2021 Threat Report covers topic areas into which Sophos has gained insight from the work
over the past 12 months by SophosLabs on malware and spam analysis, and by the Sophos Rapid
Response, Cloud Security, and Data Science teams. These aspects of our daily work protecting customers
provide insight into the threat landscape that can guide incident responders and IT security professionals
on where they should direct their efforts to defend networks and endpoints in the coming year.
We've segmented the report into four main parts: Discussion of how ransomware has transformed itself,
and where this threat is headed; analysis of the most common attacks large organizations face, and why
these metaphorical canaries in the coal mine remain significant threats; how the emergence of a global
pandemic affected information security in 2020; and a survey of the scope of attacks targeting platforms
not traditionally considered part of an enterprise's attack surface.
To summarize the key takeaways from the report:

Ransomware
Ì Ransomware threat actors continue to innovate both their technology and their criminal modus
operandi at an accelerating pace
Ì More ransomware groups now engage in data theft so they may threaten targets with extortion over the
release of sensitive private data
Ì As ransom groups put more effort into active attacks against larger organizations, the ransoms they
demand have risen precipitously
Ì Further, distinct threat actor groups that engage in ransomware attacks appear to be collaborating
more closely with their peers in the criminal underground, behaving more like cybercrime cartels than
independent groups
Ì Ransomware attacks that previously took weeks or days now may only require hours to complete

'Everyday' threats
Ì Server platforms running both Windows and Linux have been heavily targeted for attack, and leveraged
to attack organizations from within
Ì Common services like RDP and VPN concentrators remain a focus for attack on the network perimeter,
and threat actors also use RDP to move laterally within breached networks
Ì Even low-end "commodity" malware can lead to major breaches, as more malware families branch out
into becoming "content distribution networks" for other malware
Ì A lack of attention to one or more aspects of basic security hygiene has been found to be at the root
cause of many of the most damaging attacks we've investigated

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

COVID-19
Ì Working from home presents new challenges, expanding an organization's security perimeter to
thousands of home networks protected by widely varying levels of security
Ì Cloud computing has successfully borne the brunt of a lot of enterprise needs for secure computing
environments, yet still has its own challenges unique from those in a traditional enterprise network
Ì Threat actors have attempted to launder their reputations making promises not to target organizations
involved in life-saving health operations, but later reneged on those promises
Ì Criminal enterprises have branched out into a service economy that eases new criminals into the fold
Ì Cybersecurity professionals from around the world self-organized in 2020 into a rapid reaction force
to combat threats that leverage the social engineering potential of anything relating to the novel
Coronavirus

Nontraditional platforms
Ì Attackers now routinely take advantage of the wealth of "red team" tools and utilities pioneered by
penetration testers in live, active attacks
Ì Despite efforts on the part of operators of mobile platforms to monitor apps for malicious code,
attackers continue to work around the edges, developing techniques to bypass these code scans
Ì Software classified in an earlier era as "potentially unwanted" because it delivered a plethora of
advertisements (but was otherwise not malicious) has been engaging in tactics that are increasingly
indistinguishable from overt malware
Ì Data scientists have applied approaches borrowed from the world of biological epidemiology to spam
attacks and malware payloads, as a method to bridge gaps in detection

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

THE FUTURE OF RANSOMWARE
Ransomware attacks launched throughout 2020 magnified the suffering of an already wary population.
As the pandemic ravaged lives and livelihoods, so did a host of ransomware families, whose efforts did not
stop targeting the health and education sectors, even as hospitals became COVID-19 battlegrounds and
schools struggled to invent an entirely new way to teach children through March and beyond.
You can’t raise enough in a bake sale during a pandemic to pay a ransom, but some schools managed to
recover from attacks that appeared targeted at the first day of school, by keeping secure backups.
Ransomware operators pioneered new ways to evade endpoint security products, spread rapidly, and even
came up with a solution to the problem (from their perspective) of targeted individuals or companies having
good backups, securely stored where the ransomware couldn’t harm them.
But what appeared to be a wide variety of ransomware may not be as wide as it seems. As time went on,
and we investigated an increasing number of attacks, Sophos analysts discovered that some ransomware
code appeared to have been shared across families, and some of the ransomware groups appeared to work
in collaboration more than in competition with one another.
Given all this, it’s hard to make any kind of reliable prediction of what ransomware criminals will do next.
Ransomware creators and operators have burned a lot of time working on defenses against endpoint
security products. We counter their countermeasures. They show creativity and versatility in devising new
tactics; we show tenacity in studying what they do and finding clever ways to stop them.

Data theft creates a secondary extortion market
Until this year, conventional wisdom among security companies that had any experience at all with
ransomware ran quite uniformly: Lock down obvious ingress methods, such as internet-facing RDP ports;
keep good offline backups; and deal with infections of small, innocuous malware such as Dridex or Emotet
quickly, before they can deliver the killing payload.
Several high-profile ransom attacks, for instance, against school districts across the US, failed at least in
part because the IT managers had maintained an unaffected backup of critical data.
As a countermeasure to their victims’ preparedness, several ransomware families picked up on a side
hustle designed to increase pressure on their victims to pay the ransom – even if every backup with
essential data was safe. Not only would they hold the machines hostage, but they would steal the data on
those machines and threaten to release it to the world if the targets fail to pay a bounty.
Over the past half year, Sophos analysts observed that ransomware adversaries have settled on a common
(and slowly growing) toolset they use to exfiltrate data from a victim’s network. This toolset of wellknown, legitimate utilities anyone might have won’t be detected by endpoint security products. The list of
ransomware families that engage in this practice continues to grow, and now includes Doppelpaymer, REvil,
Clop, DarkSide, Netwalker, Ragnar Locker, and Conti, among many others. The attackers operate “leaks”
sites, where they publicize what data they’ve stolen; REvil allows anyone to buy the data from them right
from its website.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

The criminals use the toolset to copy sensitive internal information, compress it into an archive, and
transfer it out of the network – and out of reach of the victim. These are some of the tools we’ve seen used,
so far:
Ì Total Commander (file manager with built-in FTP Client)
Ì 7zip (Archive creation software)
Ì WinRAR (Archive creation software)
Ì psftp (PuTTY’s SFTP client)
Ì Windows cURL
When it comes to data theft, the attackers are far less picky and exfiltrate entire folders, regardless of the
file types that are contained within. (Ransomware typically prioritizes the encryption portion of the attack to
key file types and excludes many others.)
Size doesn’t matter. They don’t seem to care about the amount of data targeted for exfiltration. Directory
structures are unique to each business, and some file types can be compressed better than others. We
have seen as little as 5 GB, and as much as 400 GB, of compressed data being stolen from a victim prior to
deployment of the ransomware.

Fiig.1. In October, 2020, the Doppelpaymer ransomware leaks page revealed that the attackers had struck the networks of Hall County, Georgia. The leak
included a reference to a file called “elections” which included sample ballot proofs for the state primary elections in 2020 and lists of poll workers and their
phone numbers from the 2018 elections, among other sensitive files. The Associated Press reported that the ransomware encrypted the signature verification
database the county uses to validate ballots. Source: SophosLabs.

November 2020

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

The criminals typically send the exfiltrated data to legitimate cloud storage services, which make this
activity harder to spot, since these are common, ordinary network traffic destinations. For attackers, the
following three cloud storage services have been the most popular go-to for storing exfiltrated data:
Ì Google Drive
Ì Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Ì Mega.nz
Ì Private FTP servers
In a final act of destruction, ransomware attackers increasingly hunt for the local servers that contain
backups of critical data; when found, they delete (or independently encrypt) these backups just before the
network-wide encryption attack.
It’s more important than ever to store a backup of key data offline. If they can find it, the ransomware
criminals will destroy it.

Ransoms rise as attacks increase
It’s hard to believe that just two years ago, Sophos analysts marveled at the $6 million haul brought in
by the operators of the ransomware known as SamSam. In an attack Sophos responded to in 2020, the
ransomware operators opened their negotiations at a dollar amount of more than twice what the SamSam
gang earned in 32 months of operation.
Ransomware comes in weight classes, now: heavyweights that attack large enterprise networks,
welterweights that target civil society (public safety and local government) and small-to-medium
businesses, and featherweights that target individual computers and home users. While earning the
dubious distinction of being the heaviest heavyweight sounds impressive, it isn’t fair to compare high
ransom demands to those that originate from the lower end of the ransomware spectrum.
Sophos has a dedicated team that investigates, and often works with the targets of, ransomware attacks.
The team can forensically reconstruct the events of an attack after the fact, and sometimes disrupt attacks
while they’re still in progress. The Sophos Rapid Response team gets involved in cases when there’s a
chance to stop or limit the harm, but sometimes the attack happens so fast, there’s nothing it can do, and
the target must then decide whether or not to pay the ransom, at which point, Sophos is no longer involved.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

That’s where companies like Coveware come in. The company represents ransomware targets, as a
high-stakes negotiator with their attackers. Coveware’s CTO Alex Holdtman confirmed our suspicion, that
ransomware heavyweights are the primary driving factor in the demand for sky-high ransoms.

Fig.2. The average ransom demand has risen 21% in the past quarter and has nearly tripled over the past year. Source: Coveware.

In just the past quarter, the average ransom payout has risen by 21%, but Coveware believes the averages
can be skewed by just one or two very large ransom attacks. The average ransom payout in the justcompleted quarter is now the equivalent of $233,817.30, payable in cryptocurrency. A year ago, the average
payout was $84,116.
Ransomware threat actors understand how expensive downtime can be, and have been testing the upper
limit of what they can extract in a ransom attack.
Several ransomware families have taken up extortion as a side-hustle to help close the deal. As mentioned
earlier in our report, groups such as Netwalker and others are using this tactic. That way, even if the target
of the attack has perfectly recoverable backups of their data, they may still be forced to pay in the hopes the
ransomware criminals don’t publish their internal information to the world.
At the lower end of the ransomware spectrum, demands have been increasing, but Holdtman says they’re
nowhere near the big fish. There are a lot of small businesses and individuals that get hit, but for them the
ransom demands have remained relatively flat.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

Days-in-the-life of a ransomware rapid responder
When an organization was targeted by the then still active Maze ransomware, it turned to the Sophos Rapid Response
team. We investigated and actively countered the attack while it was still in progress. What follows is a day-by-day
summary of the attack as it unfolded.
Before Day 1

At some point before the attack becomes active, the operators
compromise a computer on the target’s network.
This computer is then used as a ‘beachhead’ in the network. On
multiple occasions, the attacker will connect from here to other
computers using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Day 1

The first evidence of malicious activity appears when a Cobalt
Strike SMB beacon is installed as a service on an unprotected
Domain Controller (DC). The attackers are able to control the DC
from the previously compromised computer by exploiting a Domain
Admin account with a weak password.

Day 2

The attackers create, execute, and then delete a series of
scheduled tasks and batch scripts. From the evidence seen by
investigators, the tasks were similar to a technique used later to
deploy the ransomware attacks. It is possible that the attackers are
testing the method they plan to use.
Using the compromised Domain Admin account and RDP access,
the attackers move laterally across the network to other critical
servers.
They use the legitimate network scanning tool, Advanced IP
Scanner to start mapping out the network and make lists of IP
addresses that would later have the ransomware deployed to them.
The attackers create a separate list of IP addresses belonging to
the computers used by the target’s IT administrators.
Next, the attackers use the Microsoft tool ntdsutil to dump Active
Directory’s hashed credential database.

Day 6

A Sunday. The first Maze ransomware attack is launched, using a
compromised Domain Admin account and the lists of IP addresses
that have been identified. Over 700 computers are targeted in
the attack, which is promptly detected and blocked by security.
Either the attackers don’t realize the attack has been prevented,
or they hope that having the stolen data to hold against the victim
is enough, because this is the moment when they issue a ransom
demand for $15 million.

Day 7

The security team installs additional security and engages 24/7
threat monitoring. The incident response investigation begins,
quickly identifying the compromised admin account, discovering
several malicious files, and blocking communication between the
attacker and the infected machines.

Day 8
Further tools and techniques used by the attackers are discovered,
as well as evidence relating to the exfiltration of data. More files and
accounts are blocked.

Day 9

Despite the defensive activity, the attackers maintain their access
to the network and a different compromised account, and launch
a second attack. This attack is similar to the first one: execute
commands on a DC, looping through the lists of IP addresses
contained in txt files.
The attack is quickly identified. The ransomware is detected
automatically and both the compromised account and the
malware payload is disabled and deleted. No files are encrypted.

The attackers execute various WMI commands to collect
information about compromised machines, and then their
attention turns to the exfiltration of data: They identify a file server
and, using the compromised Domain Admin account, access it
remotely over RDP. They start compressing folders located on it.

Cleary not wanting to give up, the attackers try again. The third
attempt comes just a few hours after the second attack.

The attackers move the archives to the domain controller, then
try to install the cloud storage application Mega on the DC. This is
blocked by security, so they switch to using the web-based version
instead and upload the compressed files.

The Maze attackers take a different approach, deploying a full copy
of a virtual machine (VM) and a VirtualBox hypervisor installer, an
attack detailed on SophosLabs Uncut in September, 2020.

Day 3

Exfiltration of data to Mega continues throughout the day.

Day 4 and 5

No malicious activity is observed during this period. In previous
incidents, we’ve observed ransomware attackers waiting to spring
the attack over a weekend or holiday, when the IT security team
isn’t working or paying close attention to what is happening in the
network.

November 2020

By now they seem to be growing desperate as this attack targets a
single computer. This is the main file server that the exfiltrated data
had been taken from.

The outcome of the third attempt is the same as before: the
Sophos Rapid Response team detected and thwarted the attack,
with no encryption of files. The team helped the customer lock out
the criminal group, and the attackers ceased being able to press
the attack further.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

EVERYDAY THREATS TO ENTERPRISES – CANARIES IN
THE COAL MINE
If everything you know about cyberattacks comes from news reports, you could be forgiven for thinking
the sky was falling. Attacks that target large organizations happen every day, but they’re not all the kind of
black swan events, like a major data breach, that can send a company’s fortunes (or stock price) tumbling
and generate bad publicity. Many attacks are far more mundane, involving malware the SophosLabs team
tracks in a sort of “Most Wanted” list of “The Usual Suspects”.
But though these attacks, and some of the malware they deliver, are well understood and easily contained,
every attack carries with it the potential to get far worse if it isn’t dealt with speedily and effectively. To carry
the bird metaphor forward, these routine, everyday attacks represent canaries in the coal mine, an early
indication of a toxic presence that could quickly spiral out of control.

Attacks targeting Windows & Linux servers
While the vast majority of security incidents we responded to in 2020 involved desktop or laptop computers
running variations of Windows, we saw a steady increase in attacks on both Windows and non-Windows
servers. In general, servers have long been attractive attack targets for a variety of reasons: They often run
for long periods unattended or unmonitored; servers often carry more CPU and memory capacity than
individual laptops; and servers may occupy a privileged space on the network, often having access to the
most sensitive and valuable data in an organization’s operation. This makes them an attractive foothold for
a persistent attacker. These characteristics won’t change in 2021 and Sophos anticipates the volume of
attacks targeting servers will continue to increase.
The majority of attacks targeting servers fit one of three profiles – ransomware, cryptominers and data
exfiltration – each of which has a corresponding, distinct set of tactics and techniques the attackers
employ. Best practices for server admins is to avoid running conventional desktop apps, like email clients or
a web browser, from the server as a safeguard against infections, so attacks targeting servers necessarily
require a shift in tactics.
Internet-facing servers running Windows receive a never-ending barrage of RDP brute-forcing attempts, an
attack tactic that, for at least the past three years, has been most often associated with (and predictive of)
ransomware attacks. The Sophos Rapid Response team frequently finds that the root cause of ransomware
attacks it investigates involve an initial access to the target’s network by means of RDP, and then the use of
those machines to gain a foothold within the network and take control of DC servers, from which they can
mount the rest of the attack.
By contrast, cryptojacking attacks tend to target a wider range of vulnerabilities in Windows, and in
applications that normally run on server hardware, such as database software.
For instance, one method used by the Lemon_Duck cryptominer involves a brute-force attack against
internet-facing servers running Microsoft SQL Server. Once the attackers guess the correct database
password, they use the database itself to reassemble the cryptojacker payload, write it out to the server’s
file system, and execute it. The infected machine then attempts to exploit the EternalBlue and/or
SMBGhost vulnerabilities in a bid to spread the cryptojacker.

November 2020

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

Lemon_Duck is an equal-opportunity attacker, and can infect Linux servers. The malware attempts to
brute-force SSH passwords taken from a relatively small list. If successful, the attackers load malicious
shellcode, which then establishes persistence by taking advantage of loopholes in a service called Redis.
The cryptojacker can also conceal itself by executing the commands to start itself from within Hadoop
clusters.

Fig.3. One of the more prolific cryptojackers, called MyKings, distributed the components responsible for installing the botnet (highlighted in green) inside a Zip
archive along with several of the exploits leaked from the NSA by the Shadow Brokers. Source: SophosLabs.

Occasionally, attackers target servers because, rather than a quick payday or a steady trickle of
cryptocurrency, they want to steal data of value stored on them. In 2020, Sophos discovered an attacker
targeting Linux servers using malware we called Cloud Snooper. The servers in question were hosted in a
cloud computing cluster, and evaded detection by inventing a clever message-relay system, piggybacking
their command-and-control messages on routine HTTP connections.

Fig.4. A “wolf in sheep’s clothing” metaphor illustration of how the Cloud Snooper APT malware concealed its commands and exfiltrated data in the guise of
conventional HTTP requests and responses, with the help of a tool that monitored network traffic and rewrote TCP/IP packets in real time. Source: SophosLabs.

Server admins have not, historically, installed endpoint protection products on servers, but with the advent
of these types of attacks, that conventional wisdom has shifted.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

Underestimate “commodity” malware at your peril
Not everybody gets hit with a zero-day vulnerability by a nation-state-sponsored Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT). Most attacks involve run-of-the-mill malware delivered by conventional means – which
typically involve a spam email, a benign-looking attachment or link, and a lot of encouragement for the
target to open that attachment. Sophos receives thousands of telemetry hits per month about such
common malware, usually an indication that a computer protected by one of our products has blocked the
attack.
In unprotected computers, where the malware can fully execute, it will profile the target’s computer; extract
any login credentials or saved passwords for websites that control something of value (usually, but not
limited to, bank or financial services accounts); then send that information back to its operators and await
further instructions, which may arrive in a few seconds...or several days later.
But don’t let the fact that these malware families are merely ordinary lull you into a false sense of security.
These malicious workhorses can cause huge problems if allowed to persist. As mentioned earlier in our
report, the SophosLabs team maintains a “Most Wanted” malware list, with analysts dedicated to those
families that remain stubbornly persistent. We’ve put together a short summary of some of them below.
Dridex and Zloader
One of the most common malware types is the loader. Loaders have features centered around delivering
another malware payload on behalf of their operators or people who contract with their operators. The
Dridex and Zloader malware families are both mature, established loader platforms. Attackers use both
Dridex and Zloader to collect information about the target system and send it back to the criminals, who
can decide at their leisure what components or payloads they will deliver, based on the information the bot
sends back.
The Dridex loader’s core function is to contact its command-and-control (C2) server, retrieve one or more
encrypted payloads, and deploy them. It’s very hard for analysts to get those payloads because the threat
actors only distribute them on an as-needed basis, such as a hidden VNC (a remote-control application),
or a SOCKS proxy. These payloads give attackers the ability to do things in the context of the user’s device.
They also allow the criminals to access resources on the victim system that are not directly reachable from
their own system.
The server-side logic that determines what happens during an infection can be inscrutable, but we can
infer some rules because the bots don’t want to infect computers used by malware analysts. The bot sends
its operators a list of installed programs; if there are analysis tools, or components of virtual machines, the
bots don’t deliver payloads to that machine. In Zloader’s case, the bot’s operators spread the malware via a
spam message; if you take too long to infect your computer, within eight to 12 hours after the spam goes
out, they stop sending payloads.
It also must be a really clean machine, but it can’t be too clean, either. A plain-vanilla Windows installation
won’t trigger, but neither will a very full machine with a lot of tools.

unique samples we encountered over a seven-month period that we later classified to one of the 18 most common RAT families, broken out by the family
names. * Partial-month data. Source: SophosLabs.

Remote Access Trojans, or RATs, and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware. As the name
suggests, RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely. Infostealers also
hew close to their name, engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials, certificates, and other sensitive
information. Two of the “Most Wanted” families we’ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla (an
infostealer) and RATicate (a RAT).
Like loaders, RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads, including
updated versions of themselves. We’ve observed RATicate distributing other malware – including Agent
Tesla. We’ve also seen these RAT families being served up from, or communicating with, the same IP
addresses or servers, which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups.
Trickbot’s takedown
Trickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years. The infamous botnet pioneered
a lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics: for instance, it communicated with its
C2 infrastructure using TLS. The bot is implicated in several high-profile ransomware attacks and is a
competent credential thief in its own right.

In October 2020, as we prepared this report, Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that
they had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnet’s command and control system that

November 2020

13

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

caused some 90% of the botnet to stop communicating with the command-and-control infrastructure.
Investigators managed to upload a “poisoned” configuration into Trickbot’s infrastructure that each bot
downloaded. The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command-and-control
server was the infected machine it was running on. The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers
and could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions.
The effort had a drastic impact on Trickbot’s operator, but they’re expected to slowly, eventually, return to
normal operation.

Delivery mechanisms
There are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate
a network. The methods of most malware attacks follow a well-worn path that may include the use of
email containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file, or the attacker may take a more active role
targeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter, facing the public internet.
RDP, the #1 attack vector for ransomware
The Windows Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, is a standard service available in all current versions of
Windows. With very little effort, RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer
when not physically in the presence of that computer, which can be great in the case of a pandemic where
everyone is suddenly forced to work from home. Unfortunately, for the past three years, ransomware threat
actors have been abusing (at an accelerating rate) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a
foothold and cause large-scale damage to enterprises, earning them an increasingly large payday from
targeted organizations.

location received.

The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem, as increasing numbers of
organizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational.
The main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the
public-facing internet. If the RDP password is weak, easily guessed or brute-forced through automated
login attempts, the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure.
The Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the
top “root causes” of the ransomware events they handle. The advice to IT managers remains the same
as it has all along: RDP should never face the public internet, but instead be placed behind a firewall that
requires users to connect via a VPN or other zero-trust facility first; and admins should strengthen Windows
password policies to require longer passwords and a multi-factor authentication token or app.
In research performed before the lockdown took effect, Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around
the world to better understand just how bad the problem had become. Over a 30 day period, the honeypots
received a median average of 467,000 RDP login attempts, or about 600 per hour at each location. The
research revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login
attempts until we finally pulled the plug.

Business Email Compromise and Business Email Spoofing
Business email compromise (BEC) is the formal name for a specific kind of spam that centers around
a fraudulent request for money. In a BEC attack, a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to
look like they originate from a high-level executive within a company, directing someone at a lower level to
perform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive. Attackers
may do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails (sometimes called Business Email Spoofing)
or they may try to take control of accounts on the organization's own mail server, and use that account to
send the fraudulent request.

Fig.9. In this real-world example of a business-email compromise attempt, the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent
request. The email has a different Reply-To address (from a Gmail account) than the one in the From: header, a dead giveaway that something is awry – if the

target is paying attention to the mail headers. Source: SophosLabs.

BEC attackers, posing as an executive, may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or
expedite a financial transaction of some kind. The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted
individuals and organizations. BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam, because they fail
to follow spam-like patterns; they (often) don’t contain an attachment or malicious link, and they try to
look like they originated from within the targeted organization, at times even incorporating the target
organization’s typical mail “signatures” or other elements that may be familiar to employees, to make them
more convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam.

Fig. 10. After the target has acknowledged the initial request, the fraudster makes the “ask” - providing a pretext that appears plausible. Source: SophosLabs.

BEC scams rely on the target of the scam (the employee) being physically distant from the subject of the
scam (the executive), and it also depends on the target acting quickly, before anyone can figure out what’s
going on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers. BEC scammers may craft a
message when they know the executive is out of the office on business.
These kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back-and-forth between the attacker and target. The
conversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into
a series of messages that eventually lead to an “ask” to make a purchase based on a plausible-sounding
pretext.

Fig.11. At some point during the attack, the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense, like a request to make a sudden, large
wire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scam’s target. This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request: Why
would the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they’re going to be handed out as gifts? Source: SophosLabs.

Back when most of us were working in offices, physical proximity between the target and subject would
have made the scam immediately apparent. But our current distributed work environment, where both the
executive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity, reduces the opportunities for
people to just walk over to someone’s desk and ask them to confirm the request.

November 2020

16

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

BEC scams existed prior to the COVID-19 era, but as more people are working remotely, BEC scammers are
on the prowl. As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive, it
is a particularly offensive type of scam. If you encounter emails like these, trust your gut and speak to the
subject in question directly, if you can, or ask for guidance from someone else if you can’t reach them. The
more real employees get involved in handling these requests, the more likely it will be that the scam will be
discovered before any damage is done.
Weird science: retro Office glitch strikes again
When it comes to malicious office documents (maldocs) and the exploits they attempt to deploy, what’s
old is often used again and again, goes away after Microsoft produces an update, and then (sometimes)
resurfaces. For years, SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety
of exploits into maldocs. Newly-disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use
maldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload, because not everyone installs patches right
away, and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective “safety net” defense,
based on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector.
Most of the maldocs we’ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders
that give attackers a literal point-and-click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit(s) to
craft into the malicious document. As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern
exploits, which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document, maldoc creators seem
to have dug deep to find a very, very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the
documents.
The bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit, though it really isn’t an exploit at all. In fact,
VelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003, although we didn’t see it abused
until 2013, when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of
the glitch. An Excel spreadsheet or Word .doc marked as “read-only” is just a password-protected document
with a stock password of, you guessed it, VelvetSweatshop.
We’ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a
way to evade advanced threat detection. Because of the encryption, the real malicious content is hidden
behind strong crypto that scanners can’t crack, and can’t scan unless they support the latest algorithm
used by attackers. Due to the use of the default-password, Excel opens the decoded content without
prompting for the password, so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent. Endpoint
security programs added support for the encryption and the default password, but the criminals keep
finding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not (yet) implemented by
AV scanners.
It was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that, if it were human, would be in its last year of school.
But it’s no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it.

Information security: A 20-year retrospective
While an annual report gives us an opportunity to look back at significant events of the past year, we thought a look further
back – at the past two decades – would provide context for how we arrived in our current threat landscape. The turn of the
millennium marked a milestone, when information security became a professional discipline and a bona fide industry. This
timeline of threats and events represent significant, representative moments in the evolution of threat behavior.
As both enterprises and individuals adopted the internet for both business and entertainment, large networks were ripe
targets for the emergence of prolific worms – self-propagating malware. Cumulatively, worms infected tens of millions of
systems worldwide and cost over $100 billion in damages and remediation costs.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

2000–2004 - The Worm era
2000 - ILOVEYOU

The ILOVEYOU worm used a social engineering trick that persists
even today: It arrived as a spam email attachment, eventually
infecting about 10% of all internet-connected Windows computers.

July 2001 - CodeRed

Named after the flavor of Mountain Dew its discoverers were
drinking at the time, CodeRed used a buffer overflow vulnerability
in IIS to spread itself and deface websites. It was followed a
month later by an upgraded version that installed a backdoor on
networked computers.

August 2001 - CodeRed II
September 2001 - Nimda
January 2003 - SQL Slammer

At only 376 bytes, Slammer exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft
database applications. Doubling its infections every 8.5 seconds,
Slammer took down large swaths of the internet in only 15
minutes.

August 2003 - Blaster

Blaster was created by reverse engineering a Microsoft patch
a couple months ahead of the first Patch Tuesday. It exploited
a buffer overflow vulnerability in the RPC service of Windows
XP and 2000 systems and launched a DDoS attack against
windowsupdate.com if the day of the month was greater than 15,
or the month was September or later.

August 2003 - Welchia
August 2003 - Sobig
October 2003 - Sober
January 2004 - Bagle
January 2004 - MyDoom

It is estimated that 25% of all emails sent in 2004 originated with
the MyDoom worm, which prolifically emailed itself to new victims
and engaged in a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

February 2004 - Netsky
April 2004 - Sasser
2005-2012 - The Malware Monetization era

Until around 2005, malware incidents could be chalked up to
curiosity or disruption. Botnet malware, designed for stealth and
profit, dominated. This era also saw the start of so-called pharmacy
spam. Exploits against software vulnerabilities became key
components of malware, which enabled malvertising. Wherever
there was the potential for financial gain, cybercriminals exploited
those opportunities.

2006 – Rx Spam

What had been a mere annoyance (or a way to propagate worms),
became a lucrative business selling mostly counterfeit prescription
medicines advertised through spam. It's estimated that pharma
spammers made billions of dollars selling medicines most people
could get just by going to their doctors.

2007 - Storm
2007 - Zeus
2008 - Conficker

Conficker rapidly infected millions of computers worldwide but did
not result in much damage. We still don't know the worm's true
purpose, but thousands of hosts remain infected to this day, and
Conficker scan traffic routinely is detected as part of the internet's
"background radiation."

November 2020

2009 - Stuxnet

Stuxnet was one of the first digital weapons to target a physical
system: Nuclear refinement centrifuges used by Iran to enrich
uranium. Stuxnet's enduring legacy is that it permanently opened
the door to nation-states' use of malware as a tool of war.

2010 - Blackhole exploit kit

Exploit kits – toolkits targeting software vulnerabilities – bound
different parts of the cybercrime ecosystem together. Crimewareas-a-Service was born when the creators of the Blackhole Exploit
Kit began offering their services.

2011 - Malvertising
2013–Present - The Ransomware era

Ransomware has had the most profound impact on this era.
While worms, banking trojans, malvertising and spam persist,
nothing has come close to rivaling ransomware's destructive force.
Damage estimates from ransomware attacks over the past seven
years are in the trillions of dollars. Ransomware is also most likely
the first form of malware linked to a human death. Moreover, many
of today's threats ultimately deliver ransomware and, like exploit
kits, it has provided a nitro-fueled boost to an already thriving
cybercrime ecosystem.

2013 - Snowden leaks
2013 - CryptoLocker

During its short existence, CryptoLocker provided future criminals
with a winning formula by mating two existing technologies:
encryption and cryptocurrencies. The threat landscape was
forever changed by CryptoLocker and its aftershocks are still being
felt today. Three months after launch, the bitcoin wallet used by
CryptoLocker contained nearly $30 million.

2014 - Point-of-sale (POS) malware
2016 - Mirai
May 2017 - WannaCry

WannaCry, the most widespread ransomware-worm hybrid seen,
demonstrated (again) how a lapse in patching can have dire
consequences. It relied on exploits stolen from the NSA and publicly
released by The Shadow Brokers. The attacks forced Microsoft to
release out-of-band updates for unsupported products.

June 2017 - NotPetya

NotPetya crippled some of the world's largest shipping and
logistics companies, reportedly causing over $10 billion in
damages. Some of the affected companies have yet to fully
recover.

2018 - Magecart attacks
2019 - Extortion ransomware

In an attack against the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, the
criminals behind Maze ransomware pioneered the use of extortion.
They not only encrypted and stole data, but also threatened to
publish the stolen data if companies didn't pay. This tactic has
been copied by many other ransomware crews as a hedge against
the targets having good backups.

2020 - APT tactics by threat actors

The adoption of nation-state tools and tactics, which began in
the past couple of years, went mainstream in 2020. Professional
cybercrime gangs use sophisticated tools like Cobalt Strike to
devastating effect, while some groups (Dharma) are baking it into
point and shoot toolkits for novices to use.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

COVID-19 AS A FORCE-MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS
The novel coronavirus, COVID-19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity. Attackers felt
emboldened to target the newly-homebound white collar workforce. An already high level of anxiety and
fear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns, ransomware that
targeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure, and
every manner of rent-seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper.

Home is the new perimeter
Everything normal ended in March 2020, when workers who could work remotely, and students at almost
all levels, were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID-19 and relieve the pressure on
overcrowded hospitals. Suddenly, we weren’t so much working from home as living at work.
Many people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office. Demand for VPN access
and multifactor authentication services surged. Chromebooks became rare commodities. Zoom went
through about ten years’ worth of evolutionary growth in two months. And through it all, Microsoft, Adobe,
Apple, and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms.

COVID-19 turned us all into our own IT departments, managing patches, security updates, and connectivity
issues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom.
Demand soared for headsets, microphones, better lighting, and security both on the network and the
endpoint. And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing, spam, online trolls, cyberbullying
and malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game, ready to play.

November 2020

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

It hasn’t been easy, and we’re still not operating where we were in February 2020, but many people are
finding the new normal might, in some ways, be an improvement. More offices have decided to continue
allowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace, which will have a
significant benefit to both the environment and to people’s quality of life.
As those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their
remote locations, circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks’ role
as the last line of defense. The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter. We need a complete
rethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth.

Crimeware as a service
It can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup. Scrappy at first, the successful
makers eventually earn a loyal following. And there can be just as many business models for malicious
software as there are for legitimate software.
The term “crimeware” is intentionally broad; some creators of malware, or of the tools that enable malware
to be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features, don’t sell their product outright, but license it
as you might buy a one-year license for the Adobe Creative Suite. We’ve called this class of business model
“crimeware-as-a-service,” (CaaS) and it seems poised to be the new normal.
One of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet. The spam-delivered trojan has been
around for years, and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would-be criminal. Emotet
is one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders. Emotet exists
primarily to deliver other malware to a target’s computer. It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated
network that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets.

Fig.14. Source: SophosLabs.

November 2020

21

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

Emotet, however, has gone through two dark periods so far this year. The malware remained in
communication with its C2 servers over a nearly five-month period in which the spam emails that normally
deliver attacks evaporated completely. Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July.
Dharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note. Unlike its pricier relations, Dharma maintains a fixed,
small ransom. The reason comes down to Dharma’s business model: It’s the ransomware with training
wheels on, for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes. Those criminals pay essentially a subscription
fee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators, and split the proceeds of any attacks with them.
As attackers branch out into specialties and sub-specialties, it seems the business model in which
criminals work with independent contractors, freelancers and affiliates is one that doesn’t seem to be going
away anytime soon.

Spam, scams, and broken promises
The lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email. In the best
of times, the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient
act on the message. This is a well-known psychological trick, because if you take a couple of moments to
think about the contents of the spam message, you’ll probably realize it’s a fake. If the spammer triggers a
fear reaction, you act before you think, and you get snared in the trap.
COVID-19 already had everyone on a hair trigger, so spammers didn’t even have to try particularly hard.

Fig.15. Source: SophosLabs.

A few weeks into the lockdown, we decided to take a closer look at another growing phenomenon: Domain
registrations. Within weeks, people were registering thousands of new domain names per day that
contained any combination of the strings COVID-19, Corona, or virus.

Fig.16. Source: SophosLabs.

Some of the sites were obvious jokes, while others were confusingly similar to those used by legitimate,
regional or national health authorities.

Remote work raises the importance of
secure cloud computing
When the COVID-19 lockdowns began in March 2020, people and workplaces began a rapid and
unprecedented transition that continues to this day. How we work, go to school, attend events and
conferences, and entertain ourselves may have changed forever, and cloud computing was an essential
element of that rapid evolution, but it faces a lot of challenges.
The overprovisioning of access permissions, limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a
lack of auditing, can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as
bad in the cloud as it is everywhere else. For instance, cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud. The
computing-cycles-heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines, and
run up the electricity bill; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances:
The target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations
performing the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies’ worth of cryptocurrency.
Further, many dispersed, remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks, where criminals locked
down the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines. After all, ransomware can
encrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage. Organizations whose cloud
infrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent
encrypting the data, but for the ransom, too.

Fig.20. In our 2020 Cloud Security Report, Sophos surveyed more than 3,500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud, and found that many of
the security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones. Source: SophosLabs.

On lockdown, IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before
many workplaces closed down. The big changes COVID-19 demanded came in three waves.
In the first few weeks after the lockdowns began, the first wave – an access wave – began to take shape.
As millions of workers, suddenly unable to go to their workplace, needed to access resources inside their
organization’s environment, rapidly growing demand for virtual private network (VPN) or other zero-trust
facility access overwhelmed existing resources. Along with VPNs, organizations found they needed to add
new firewalls and other security appliances, deployments of modern unified threat management systems
supplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services.
In the pre-COVID-19 world, VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly
outnumbered traveling or remote workers. As March turned into May and then June, for these workers, the
VPN became an essential lifeline (if not the essential lifeline) that kept organizations in operation.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

But those organizations also quickly realized that employees shouldn’t use personal devices from home to
access the VPN, and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already
struggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce. Without enough physical machines, for the time
being, organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a
secure computing workspace. That began the second wave – the virtual desktop wave.
As more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop, the move to hosting those desktops
in the cloud made practical and cost sense, but they still required protection.
Suddenly, IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs, and suddenly needed
visibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers,
virtual desktops, and other cloud services – the cloud management wave.

The attacker discovered, then used those credentials to attack, using the native cloud provider’s APIs – spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin.
At the same time, they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate. Later, they revoked access to other legitimate users.

The COVID-19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life, including how
many work. In a recent survey by Reuters, 97% of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped
up their transition to new technology. But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty, nearly one out of every
three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost-effective a way
possible.
In Sophos’ most recent Cloud Security Report, we found that the majority of security incidents
involving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes: stolen or phished credentials, or
misconfigurations that led to breaches. Seven out of ten of the more than 3,700 IT professionals surveyed
for the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months
prior to the survey.

What the CCTC means for a rapid response to large scale threats
About a week into the COVID-19 lockdown, Sophos chief scientist,
Joshua Saxe put out a global call for volunteers. The virtual bucket
brigade rapidly became the COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition
(CCTC), an organization numbering more than 4,000 members in
service of one goal: To put special effort into countering any type of
threat or social engineering that attempted to leverage the public’s
fear about COVID-19, by name or inference.
“I’m not a firefighter, so I wouldn’t know how to fight a building
fire, but I can assist a team that’s going to bolster the defenses of
critical infrastructure, like hospitals,” says CCTC’s Nick Espinosa, a
security analyst and podcaster based in Chicago.
This was a very necessary effort. From the earliest points of the
lockdown period, attackers spread spam, malware, and a variety of
other threats that made reference, in one form or another, to the
frightening, new pandemic lingo. As mentioned in the main report,
at one point, people were registering thousands of new domains
with the words COVID-19, corona, or CoV in their names, each day.
Sophos traced domains connected to TLS certificates with those
same text strings in the certificate data and found thousands more.

Because of the unique nature of the threat posed by COVID-19,
malicious spam that abuses the global crisis represents something
particularly egregious and offensive. “We saw an explosion
of criminal hacking using COVID-19 as a lure,” said Espinosa.
Spam campaigns spun up, in which the spammers dressed
the messages like official communiques from the World Health
Organization, the CDC in the US, the UK’s NHS, drug companies, or
national health authorities in countries outside the US and UK.

The CCTC’s product, the collected output, is its intelligence feed
listing newly-gathered indicators of compromise. The feed is
free to use, by anyone. These IoCs complement the defensive
technologies already in place, in a vendor-neutral way. When the
CCTC formed a partnership with the Cyber Threat Alliance, the
security vendors that participate in the CTA amplified the protective
effect of CCTC’s threat intelligence by ingesting and defending
against those threats.

Analysts also saw references to COVID-19 in strings inside of
binaries and used as variables in so-called living-off-the-land,
LOLscripts.

The rapid coalescence of security professionals, sharing a common
goal, was heartwarming, says Espinosa. “We probably were a hot
mess out of the gate,” he says, but the group self-organized quickly.
The completion of the CCTC sharing platform means anyone who
might need to respond to a COVID-19-like pandemic in the future
won’t have to reinvent the wheel, and can respond more readily
to threats – a healthy metaphor for, and analogue of, the immune
system itself.

CCTC participants shared samples and intelligence about all
manner of incidents through a hastily set-up Slack. Chaotic at first,
the organization formed a rudimentary structure quickly. “So many
people came together and were fire-hosing so much information,”
Espinosa says.

NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN: THREATS VIA
NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS
We live in a world surrounded by computing devices that don’t look like a computer or server: routers,
mobile phones, firewalls, smart TVs, streaming boxes, VoIP boxes, cameras and camera doorbells, network
attached storage, some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances, and on and on.
But just because they don’t look like traditional computers, it doesn’t mean they can’t be misused or abused
in the same way.

Android Joker malware growing in volume
Android users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google (which owns the Android
platform and its primary Google Play Store) and malware creators who want their malware listed for
download on the Google Play Store. Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code
of Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store, in search of chunks of code that indicate a
malicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user. Malware app developers have had to work
hard to evade the Google Play Store code checks.
Joker, aka Bread, is a premium SMS and billing fraud app, one of the more successful examples of a
malware family that has evolved to evade these code checks. Google has removed thousands of these
Joker-modified malicious apps from the Google Play Store since last year, when researchers first
discovered it. Despite the amount of effort put in to getting rid of the malware, Joker keeps bouncing back.
Joker appears in the guise of a wide range of different apps: utilities and tools, wallpapers, translators,
messaging services – just many clones of popular apps. Remember, Joker may actually be embedded in an
app that looks and works exactly like the real version of almost any app you use. The Joker apps just have
a little extra malware code buried deep, in one of the third-party libraries app makers routinely compile into
their apps for a variety of legitimate reasons.
There are a few reasons why Joker manages a successful evasion of Google Play Store security code
checks time and time again:
1. The malicious apps use obfuscation, from simple string substitution to complex commercial packers, to
slow analysis and fool the Google Play Store.
2. When the Joker “developer” launches the app, it contains absolutely no malicious code. This establishes
a history where the app that comes into Google Play Store is clean. Only later does the malicious code
appear in the app, following an update.
3. The app either decrypts its payload at runtime or downloads it dynamically, later.
Joker malware uses native code (JNI) instead of the more common DEX. Native code uses C for
programming, which slows down the analysis of malicious code. By comparison, DEX, being a variation
on Java code, is much easier to decompile into something human-readable. The malware uses this JNI
code for sending SMS messages, to make money and as one way of contacting its command-and-control
network. The use of JNI and out-of-band signalling over the phone network instead of the internet may help
Joker evade automated dex scanners that don’t speak JNI.
Joker clearly has developed an edge in the battle against Google’s automated code review on new apps,
and we see no sign that Joker will slow down in 2021 and may be joined by competitors before long.

Ads & PUAs increasingly indistinguishable from malware
Malicious advertisements (malvertising) remain a major source of threats to a range of devices. We recently
delved into two current trends in malvertising threats that fall outside the realm of malware attacks—
technical support scams using “browser locking” web pages, and ads targeting mobile devices that are
linked to fraudulent or “fleeceware” apps. Sophos classifies these as “fake alert” attacks—malvertisements
that attempt to scare their targets into taking an action that will enrich the scammers behind them.

Fig. 24. Source: SophosLabs

Technical support scams typically attempt to steer targets into providing remote access to their computers
and then convincing them to either purchase exorbitantly priced technical support software and services
or obtain targets’ credit card data for fraudulent purposes. While many of these scams have relied on direct
telemarketing calls in the past, many scam operators have moved to a “pull” model—using malicious web
advertisements that attempt to convince the user that their computers have been locked for security
reasons, and directing them to call the scammers themselves.

November 2020

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

To achieve this, the scammers deploy website kits containing scripts designed to make it difficult to
navigate away from a page— including variations on the “evil cursor” (making the mouse pointer appear to
be pointing somewhere it isn’t, or rendering it invisible) and “infinite download” attacks that overwhelm the
browser—while trying to look like an alert from Microsoft or Apple. Some of the kits we found exploited a bug
SophosLabs’ offensive security team discovered in Firefox earlier this year, while others executed similar
attacks on other browsers—all of them being spread through malicious “pop-under” web ads.

Fig. 25. Source: SophosLabs

The same ad network infrastructure supporting these attacks on PC and Mac browsers also serves up
tech support scams and fake alerts that link to potentially unwanted mobile applications—including apps
claiming to be virtual private network services and “cleaner” tools advertised as removing malware, with
built-in subscription fees (and in some cases, actual Android malware). Sophos found a collection of ad
campaign servers delivering these ads, using commercial software from a Russian developer specifically
built for running such campaigns.

SOPHOS 2021 THREAT REPORT

Using your own strengths against you: Criminal abuse of
security tools
Some attacks don’t involve malware at all, or wait to deliver malware until the very end of the attack,
instead using just the tools already on the operating systems running on computers across a network.
Other criminals may leverage the power of a range of tools used by two large segments of the information
security industry: incident responders and penetration testers.
The information security community has defined the style of attacks that involve very little or no malware,
but instead harness the existing components of the operating system or popular software packages,
pular software packages, as living-off-the-land (LOL). These attacks usually involve one or more forms of
automation in the form of native scripting such as PowerShell, batch files, or VBScript scripts, collectively
referred to as LOLscripts. The attackers use these LOLscripts to execute sequences of commands using
living-off-the-land binaries (applications), colloquially called LOLbins.
Software originally designed for the “red team” segment of the industry comprises the bring your own
attack method. Attackers, in this case, deploy and use off-the-shelf security tools that are commonly used
by network administrators and penetration testers. These include tools such as Cobalt Strike and elements
of the Metasploit framework, designed for use in security assessments and technical tests.

These tools are valuable to attackers for a number of reasons: Because they’re often used in a legitimate
capacity (to audit or otherwise improve system security) it can also be difficult for anti-virus or security
solutions to detect such tools or activity outright. As such, Sophos must rely more heavily on the study of
the LOLscripted behavior to identify potential malicious activity. And of course, it’s easier to use something
that’s already been created than to build your own tools from scratch.

The wide variety of attack tools range from commercially available applications to open source GitHub
repositories, with functionalities that may include:
Ì Botnet-like command-and-control frameworks
Ì Shellcode generation and obfuscation
Ì Anti-virus evasion and sandbox detection
Ì Password or credential extraction
Ì Kerberoasting (maintaining persistence of Domain Admin privileges)
Ì The ability to brute force passwords used by a variety of services
Ì System data exfiltration
Most of these types of tools contain benign payloads or no payload at all in their “out of the box” state,
but in the past, we have been able to detect many of these tools engaging in malicious activity based on
contextual information acquired via our behavioral detection technologies.
According to our telemetry, the ten attack tools we have seen most commonly in use are (in order of
frequency of use) Metasploit, BloodHound, mimikatz, PowerShell Empire, Cobalt Strike, Veil Evasion, Hydra
THC, Enigma, Nishang, and Shellter. Metasploit is far and away the most commonly seen tool, appearing
about twice as often as the next most-common attack tool, BloodHound.
Sophos currently tracks the use of 99 different attack tools; it seems unlikely that we’ll see a reprieve from
attackers continuing to take advantage of these well-written tools throughout 2021.

Digital epidemiology
What percentage of computing devices are infected with
undetected malware? What percentage of command line
executions are executed by undetected adversaries? What
percentage of targeted phishing emails go undetected? How do
all these rates change as a function of industry, geolocation, and
network posture?
Asking such questions is similar to asking, “what percentage of
people are infected with COVID-19?” in a context in which many
people might never get tested for the virus, those tests that are
performed can have significant false positive and false negative
rates.
In other words: it’s hard.
Despite these challenges, epidemiologists answer critical
questions about COVID-19 daily. Unfortunately, cybersecurity
researchers fail to do the same for cyberattacks. We lag behind
epidemiologists in the tools, techniques and procedures we’ve built
to reason under uncertainty. There’s no excuse, and it’s time we
built our own tools to understand the nature of the threat we face,
accurately report risks to those we defend, and make decisions
about where to direct our efforts.
To help in this mission, Sophos AI has embarked on the project
of building a set of epidemiology-inspired statistical models for
estimating the prevalence of malware infections in total. We
combine a robust data collection pipeline that collects data from
100 million endpoints with a set of Bayesian statistical methods
that let us tackle these difficult questions to build a complete
picture of the performance of our models “in the field”.

0%

For example, consider the question: “How much malware is
actually affecting our customers week over week, and how much of
that are we detecting?”
If we already knew which files were malware and which were
benign for all files, we’d already be done! Unfortunately, we have
two problems.
1. We don’t actually know the ground truth behind any given file
– any endpoint product will miss at least some malware, and
the occasional false positive (a normal file that gets flagged as
malware) is inevitable
2. The balance between benign and malicious files is
overwhelmingly tipped towards benign ones, so we probably
can’t figure it out with manual analysis – we’d have to do an indepth analysis of thousands of files that our endpoint product
labeled as benign to find a single malicious one
To address these problems, we turn to Bayesian statistics. In
extremely simple terms, we build a “generative” model of the data:
a mathematical program that can take guesses about parameters
(“how much malware is there really?”), and turn those guesses
into simulations of how many endpoint detections we might see.
Then we try out different guesses, see which simulations match
observed reality, and work backwards to find plausible values of the
parameter we’re interested in.
For example, imagine we have 2,000 endpoint detections and a
good estimate of model true and false positive rates for a particular
week. We can simulate worlds with malware rates of 0%, 2%, 5%,
and so on, and see what the simulation predicts for endpoint
detections; if we see close to 2,000 detections for some malware
rates, then that’s (perhaps) a plausible value.

You can iterate this process millions of times to build a distribution
of plausible values for malware rate, and because we use a
Bayesian approach, error bars are “built in” to the estimate. In our
example, the model thinks that the most likely value for “what
percentage of files are malware?” is just over 3%, but anything from
about 2.75% to about 3.35% is quite plausible.

signature-based, behavioral, or heuristic options turned on) we
can flesh out a complete matrix of true and false positives and
negatives, and complete our picture of model performance. In
this case we see that while we do have some false negatives, the
number of false positives is low and skewed towards zero, while the
number of true positives is high and skewed towards 161,000 (the
total number of positive results in the sample). Looking at the scale,
we can see that all three quantities are dwarfed by the number of
true negatives – benign files that our ML labeled as benign.

And once we have a good idea of this number – how many files
per hundred are likely to be malware across customer endpoints
– missed detections and false positives become fairly simple
to estimate. If we look at data from our deep learning ML-based
malware detection system for a week in May (without any
