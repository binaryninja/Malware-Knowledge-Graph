Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the
Force (CNMF). The malware variant, known as SlothfulMedia, has been used by a sophisticated cyber actor. CISA and CNMF are distributing this
defense and reduced exposure to malicious activity. This MAR includes suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.
The sample is a dropper, which deploys two files when executed. The first is a remote access tool (RAT) named ‘mediaplayer.exe’’, which is desig
control (C2) of victim computer systems. Analysis has determined the RAT has the ability to terminate processes, run arbitrary commands, take sc
registry, and modify files on victim machines. It appears to communicate with its C2 controller via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transm
(TCP).
The second file has a random five-character name and deletes the dropper once the RAT has persistence. Persistence is achieved through the cr
named “Task Frame”, which ensures the RAT is loaded after a reboot.
Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the CISA or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), an
highest priority for enhanced mitigation. For more information on malicious cyber activity, please visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10303705-1.v1.stix.

The program collects the computer name, user name, OS version, adapter information, memory usage, and logical drives for the system. This info
into a string that is hashed and sent as part of the initial POST request to the C2. The program will expect to receive a '200 OK' response from the

program will await a command. The program is capable of executing the following tasks from commands issued by the C2:

2. Open a Command Line.
3. Move Files.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
