As a continuation to our previously published blog post on VMWare Horizon being targeted
through the Log4j vulnerability, we have now identified Unifi Network applications being
targeted in a similar way on a number of occasions. Based on prevention logs from
Morphisec, the first appearance of successful exploitation occurred on January 20, 2022.
Morphisec expertise comes from being the best breach prevention software, using Moving
Target Defense, that stops ransomware and other advanced attacks that today’s NGAV and
EDR solutions are unable to stop, in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
The uniqueness of the attack is that the C2 is correlated to a previous SolarWind attack as
reported by CrowdStrike.
Not surprisingly, a POC for the exploitation of Unifi Network was released a month prior (24th
of December), and we, therefore, expected to see this type of targeted exploitation in the
wild.

Log4j Vulnerability (Log4Shell) on Ubiquiti UniFi

Ubiquiti normal execution command line:

(We recommend identifying powershell execution as a child process to this command-line
execution statement)

In most cases, unifi applications (by ubiquiti ) are deployed with the highest privilege levels.

Powershell Reverse TCP to CobaltStrike
We have identified in-memory cobalt beacon dropped by the following base64 encoded
reverse tcp powershell script which were communicating with 179.60.150[.]32:

Origin:
https://github.com/ivan-sincek/powershell-reversetcp/blob/master/src/prompt/powershell_reverse_tcp_prompt.ps1
We found that the C2 used in the attack was previously noted as part of the SolarWind
supply chain attack, Cobalt beacon C2, and was attributed to TA505 aka GRACEFUL
SPIDER, a well known financially motivated threat actor group. These attacks are often
motivated by opportunities to sell sensitive data or perpetrate ransomware demands to
prevent exposure. TA505, the name given by Proofpoint, has been in the cybercrime
business for at least five years. This is the group behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan
and Locky ransomware, delivered through malicious email campaigns via Necurs botnet.
Other malware associated with TA505 includes Philadelphia and GlobeImposter ransomware
families. More on TA505 here.
These types of attacks underscore how traditional security solutions are failing to detect and
prevent the latest threats, which have become far more frequent and sophisticated. With the
average ransomware attack now occurring every few seconds, and ransoms costing
organizations millions, security teams should explore ways to augment or replace current
solutions that are no longer adequate. Leading analysts, such as Gartner, are pointing to
Moving Target Defense as a way to detect and prevent attacks that are now bypassing next
