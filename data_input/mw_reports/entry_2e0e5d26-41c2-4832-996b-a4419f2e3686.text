The ransomware landscape is constantly evolving as threat actors react to law enforcement
interest, excessive media scrutiny, or adverse public opinion. ‘Retirement’ claims or an
unexplained and sudden disappearance often indicate that a threat group is rebranding,
reorganizing, or tightening operational security. Ransomware campaigns are financially
driven, and the potential for profit incentivizes the threat actors to operate as long as
possible. As demonstrated by a shutdown of GOLD SOUTHFIELD operations and
subsequent reemergence of a new REvil version, threat groups modify their tactics and
malware as necessary to address and minimize risks to their operations.

REvil shutdown
On September 7, 2021, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed
that the ransom payment site and victim leak site for the GOLD SOUTHFIELD threat group’s
REvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation had resumed responding to web requests
after abruptly going offline on July 13. On September 9, a newly created ‘REvil’ persona
posted messages to the “exploit . in” underground forum explaining that the shutdown
occurred because GOLD SOUTHFIELD spokesperson ‘UNKN’ (also known as Unknown)
may have been arrested and the clearnet ransom payment servers were compromised (see
Figure 1).

Reemergence with a new version
On September 9, CTU™ researchers identified a REvil sample on the VirusTotal analysis site
that appears to be a new version. However, it includes a version value of 2.06. REvil 2.06
was released in April. The latest known version as of the shutdown was REvil 2.08, which
was uploaded to VirusTotal on July 10. Despite the 2.06 version value, the September
sample has a compilation timestamp of “Sat Sep 04 10:16:49 2021,” which is almost two
months after the shutdown. While it is possible to timestomp a binary’s compilation
timestamp, analysis of previous REvil samples indicates that GOLD SOUTHFIELD does not
modify this value. It is highly likely that the September sample is a new version.
CTU analysis and the REvil persona’s posts suggest that GOLD SOUTHFIELD was forced to
restore the REvil codebase from a backup of version 2.06. Changes made in versions 2.07
and 2.08 were reverted in the analyzed September 2021 sample. For example, the original
2/12

2.06 version includes a function to terminate prohibited services that stored its strings in an
unencoded state (see Figure 2).

In version 2.07, the malware author updated this and several other functions to store the
strings in an encoded state (see Figure 3). However, the September 2021 sample reverted to
unencoded strings.

CTU analysis of the September 2021 sample revealed the following modifications that
distinguish it from previous versions:

3/12

Changes encrypted configuration storage location: Previous REvil binaries
contained five sections. The text, rdata, data, and reloc sections were common across
all versions. The fifth section was randomly named and contained the RC4-encrypted
configuration structure (see Figure 4).

(Source: Secureworks)
The September 2021 sample omits the fifth section, and the encrypted configuration
was moved to the beginning of the existing data section (see Figure 5). The
configuration remains RC4-encrypted, and the data structure still consists of the RC4
key, the CRC32 hash of the encrypted configuration, the length of the configuration,
and the encrypted configuration.

Removes debug and prohibited region checks: Since its inception, REvil performed
a pre-infection check to ensure that the compromised system did not reside within the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This validation was controlled by a ‘dbg’
element contained within the REvil configuration. If the malware detected a CIS region
and the dbg configuration element was set to false, REvil did not infect the system (see
Figure 6). This behavior was one of several characteristics that suggested the threat
actors likely reside within a CIS region.

Secureworks)
This validation was removed in the September 2021 sample (see Figure 7) although
the dbg configuration element is still present in the configuration.

checks. (Source: Secureworks)
As of this publication, it is unclear why this validation was removed. The validation
likely protected the malware author, as infected systems within the CIS region could
result in unwanted attention from local authorities. It is possible that the malware author
removed this check in response to public reports that describe how organizations can
leverage this feature to prevent ransomware infections. While the threat actors
removed this check from the code, they instituted restrictions on which types of
organizations affiliates could target to accomplish the same goal of avoiding
organizations in the CIS region.

Changes password and registry values for safe mode option: REvil 2.05
introduced a safe mode option. This reboot feature set the current user’s password,
configured automatic logon, created RunOnce registry values to handle post-reboot
operations, and then rebooted the system. In the September 2021 sample, the current
user’s password was changed from ‘DTrump4ever’ to ‘U1k$NEIq3c6Q’. The RunOnce
registry values used for post-reboot operations were changed from ‘*AstraZeneca’ to
‘*Ponyaz’ and from ‘*MarineLePen’ to ‘*b2I0uo’ (see Figure 8).

Removes persistence: The persistence logic that resumes encryption if a victim
reboots the system during the encryption process was removed in the September 2021
sample. The presence of persistence logic has been inconsistent across REvil
versions.
Removes Network Discovery enablement: REvil 2.07 introduced functionality that
attempted to enable Network Discovery by executing the following command via the
WinExec function: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”Network Discovery” new
enable=Yes. It is possible that this functionality was not intentionally removed. If GOLD
SOUTHFIELD restored the code from a version 2.06 backup, this feature had not yet
been implemented.

7/12

Removes duplicate process termination functionality: Starting with version 1.03,
REvil implemented two redundant functions for process termination: a thread that
continuously monitored for the creation of new “prohibited” processes, and an initial
one-time scan for running processes considered to be prohibited (see Figure 9).
Prohibited processes are defined in the ‘prc’ configuration element and are typically
processes that could result in resource conflicts during the encryption process (e.g.,
sql, firefox, winword). Both functions attempted to terminate detected prohibited
processes.

The September 2021 sample does not contain the initial scan for prohibited process
termination. It only contains the more robust thread that continuously monitors for
prohibited processes.

8/12

Removes C2 functionality: After REvil successfully encrypts a system, it has an
option to communicate basic details to one or more GOLD SOUTHFIELD command
and control (C2) servers. If the ‘net’ configuration element is set to true, REvil sends
encrypted data about the infected system, the malware’s encryption, and the malware
instance. CTU researchers refer to the encrypted data sent to the C2 servers as ‘stats’.
Figure 10 shows an example of the stats data structure in its unencrypted form.

Secureworks)
While the ‘net’ configuration element is present in the September 2021 sample, the C2
logic was removed. The ‘dmn’ configuration element that stored approximately 1,200
C2 domains was also removed.
In the September 2021 sample, the stats data is only located within the ransom note
dropped to disk during the file encryption process. The ransom note instructs the victim
to submit the encrypted stats string to the ransom payment site to begin the ransom
payment and data restoration process.

Discontinues clearnet ransom payment site: GOLD SOUTHFIELD traditionally
included both clearnet and Tor-based ransom payment domains in its ransom notes.
The first REvil clearnet domain was decryptor . top, which was suspended by its
registrar on January 20, 2020. GOLD SOUTHFIELD switched to decryptor . cc for
approximately a year before switching to decoder . re on January 23, 2021. As of this
publication, the decoder . re domain does not resolve to an IP address even though
GOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure is online. The ransom note references a
‘secondary website’ and does not include a clearnet domain (see Figure 11).

Updates registry key and values: The registry key that stores encryption-related
information was changed from SOFTWARE\BlackLivesMatter, which was introduced in
a beta version of REvil 2.04, to SOFTWARE\XMT0qpW. The value names stored within
this key also changed, which is consistent with the author’s pattern of renaming registry
values in each version. The value used to store the encrypted session private key was
removed, possibly to prevent unauthorized decryption of a victim’s files if the threat
actor’s private keys are compromised. Table 1 defines the registry values in the
September 2021 sample.

Universal decryptor
On September 16, Bitdefender announced a universal decryption tool for REvil infections
that occurred prior to July 13. During CTU analysis, the tool successfully decrypted files
encrypted by multiple REvil versions released prior to that date. This tool is not an offline
decryptor. The infected system must connect to the internet to download the appropriate
decryption key from Bitdefender’s servers. Connecting to the internet could expose the
compromised organization to unintended consequences such as new infections or data loss
if additional malware is running on the infected system. Additionally, as of this publication
Bitdefender has not disclosed if telemetry is collected from the network traffic to the
decryption key server and how the vendor and law enforcement might use that information.
CTU researchers highly recommend that organizations perform their own risk assessment
before using this decryption tool.
Bitdefender’s collaboration with law enforcement on the universal decryptor and the REvil
spokesperson’s claims that GOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure was compromised suggest
that law enforcement compromised the infrastructure and confiscated the threat group’s
private keys. In response, GOLD SOUTHFIELD appears to be reducing its attack surface by
eliminating clearnet infrastructure and removing unnecessary features.

Conclusion
CTU researchers had hypothesized that GOLD SOUTHFIELD proactively shut down
operations in response to the U.S. government’s commitment to address the ransomware
threat following high-profile attacks on Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya. However, the
REvil spokesperson’s claims suggest that the shutdown was due to law enforcement actions
against the threat group and its infrastructure. The reactivation of the group’s infrastructure,
the emergence of a new underground forum spokesperson, and evidence of active malware
development indicate that GOLD SOUTHFIELD has resumed operations.
Ransomware attacks are often opportunistic. Threat actors search for systems that have lax
security and exposed vulnerabilities. Organizations should implement good security practices
and controls to secure their environments. Removing initial access vectors can minimize the
risk of a ransomware attack. It is critical that organizations implement and routinely test a 32-1 backup strategy to ensure speedy recovery in the event of a successful ransomware
attack.
