Emotet Activity Identified
esentire.com/security-advisories/emotet-activity-identified

THE THREAT
As of November 15th, 2021, multiple sources [1] [2] have observed activity associated with
the Emotet malware. This activity includes malware delivery through email and existing
infections.
Successful Emotet payload execution has not been observed across customers at this time.
The Threat Intelligence team assesses with medium confidence current campaigns are
focused on re-establishing botnet infrastructure following law enforcement's action to take
down the botnet in January 2021[3]. Email delivery techniques and payload execution remain
consistent or similar to past Emotet infections. The eSentire Threat Intelligence team
assesses, with medium confidence, Emotet’s email campaigns will continue.

What we’re doing about it
eSentire MDR for Network and Endpoint have rules in place to detect Emotet.
IP addresses associated with Emotet have been blocked via MDR for Network.
Threat hunting has been performed for all eSentire MDR for Endpoint customers.
eSentire security teams are tracking this threat for additional detection and prevention
opportunities.

What you should do about it
Employ email filtering and protection measures
Block or quarantine email attachments such as EXEs, Password Protected Zip
archives, JavaScript, Visual Basic scripts.
Implement anti-spoofing measures such as DMARC and SPF.
Employ an MFA solution to reduce impact of compromised credentials.
Train users to identify and report suspicious emails, including from trusted contacts.

Protect endpoints against malware
Ensure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.
Use a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to
detect and contain threats.
Limit or disable macros across the organization. See UK's National Cyber
Centre guidance on Macro Security

Additional information
Emotet is an information stealer malware that is also used for initial access by multiple
threats such as Qakbot and Trickbot. Emotet has been previously observed leading to Ryuk,
Conti, ProLock, and Egregor ransomware threats.
As of this writing, follow-on malware has not been observed in these latest campaigns.
Emotet activity halted in early 2021, after law-enforcement acted against the Emotet threat
and seized malicious infrastructure. Recent activity is believed to be focused on reestablishing botnet hosts.
