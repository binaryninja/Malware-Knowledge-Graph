The hidden C2: Lampion trojan release 212 is on the rise and using a C2 server for two
years.
Lampion trojan is one of the most active banking trojans impacting Portuguese Internet end
users since 2019. This piece of malware is known for the usage of the Portuguese
Government Finance & Tax (Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira) email templates to lure
victims to install the malicious loader (a VBS file). However, fake templates of banking
organizations in Portugal have been used by criminals to disseminate the threat in the wild,
as observed in Figure 1 below with a malicious PDF (151724540334 Pedidos.pdf).

Figure 1: Emails templates are delivering malicious PDFs impersonating banking
organizations in Portugal to spread Lampion trojan.
The malware TTP and their capabilities remain the same observed in 2019, but the trojan
loader – the VBS files – propagated along with the new campaign has significant differences.
Also, the C2 server is the same noticed on the past campaigns since 2020, suggesting, thus,
1/19

that criminals are using the same server geolocated in Russia for two years to orchestrate all
the malicious operations.

As expected, the Lampions’ VBS loader has been changed in the last years, and its modus
operandi is similar to other Brazilian trojans, such as Maxtrilha, URSA, Grandoreiro, and so
on. In detail, criminals are enlarging the file size around 56 MB of junk to bypass its detection
in contrast to the samples from 2019 with just 13.20 KB.

Figure 2: Lampions’ VBS loader file enlarge technique to bypass its detection.
The VBS file contains a lot of junk sequences, and after some rounds of code cleaning and
deobfuscation, 31.7 MB of useless lines of code were removed.

Figure 3: Lampions’ VBS loader size before and after removing the junk sequences.
The final file after the cleaning process has around 24.7 MB, and it is responsible for creating
other files, including:
a 2nd VBS file with a random name (2nd_stage_vbs) that will download the Lampions’
final stage – two DLLs from AWS S3 buckets
other VBS file that will execute the previous file by using a scheduled task also created
by the 1st VBS loader.

The next figure presents the structure of the Lampions’ VBS loader after the cleaning and
deobfuscation process.

Figure 4: Lampion’s VBS loader after some rounds of deobfuscation.
As mentioned, the 1st stage (Comprovativo de pagamento_2866-XRNM_15-02-2022 0643-54_28.vbs) creates a new VBS file (2nd_stage_vbs) inside the %AppData%\Local\Temp
folder with a random name (sznyetzkkg.vbs). Also, another VBS (jghfszcekwr.vbs) is
created with code responsible for executing the previous VBS file (sznyetzkkg.vbs) via a
scheduled task.
A scheduled task is created with the service description and author Administrator user
associated. This scheduled task will execute the second VBS file jghfszcekwr.vbsthat
contains instructions to finally run the sznyetzkkg.vbs file (the 2nd VBS stage).

Figure 5: Creation of the 2nd VBS file and the auxiliary VBS file. Also, the scheduled task
responsible for creating the auxiliary VBS file is shown.
5/19

After running the initial VBS file, the two additional VBS files are finally prepared to be
triggered. That task is then performed by the scheduled task as presented in Figure 6. The
source code of the jghfszcekwr.vbs file is quite simple and just executes the 2nd VBS file
(sznyetzkkg.vbs). We believe this is just a procedure to make hard the malware analysis as
well as difficult its detection – something we confirmed during the analysis, as the AVs don’t
detect properly those files during the malware infection chain.

Figure 6: Schedule task (1) responsible for executing an auxiliary VBS (2) file which in turn
runs the second VBS stage.
After that, the VBS file dubbed sznyetzkkg.vbs is executed. All the steps highlighted in
Figure 7 are typically known from the last Lampions campaigns. This VBS file is quite similar
to their predecessors, and it performs some tasks:
Deletes all the files from the startup folder with the following extension: lnk, vbs, cmd,
exe, bat and js.
Decrypts the URLs containing the final stage of Lampion trojan.
Creates a .cmd file into the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence.

Figure 7: Source-code of the 2nd VBS file and the encrypted URLs that will download the
last stage of the Lampion trojan banker.
From this point, the modus operandi and TTP are the same observed since 2019. The clear
sign is the same algorithm used in 2019 to decrypt the hardcoded strings with the malicious
URLs was used. The script can be downloaded from GitHub here.

Lampion trojan. Once again, the AWS S3 buckets were the criminals’ choice, as observed in
the last releases of this malware.

The first DLL (the trojan loader) is a point of interest in this analysis. This file was also
enlarged with lots of random BMP images inside – a well-known technique that is being
used by Latin American gangs in their malware. This is a clear sign of cooperation
between the several groups.
The P-17-4 DLL is then renamed when downloaded and injected into the memory via the
DLL injection technique. The EAT function “mJ8Lf9v0GZnptOVNB2I” is triggered to start the
DLL loader.

Figure 9: Lampion DLLs – release 212 (February 2022).
The main goal of the DLL loader is just to unzip the 2nd DLL called “soprateste.zip” which is
protected with a hardcoded password. All the process from this point is the same as the last
articles we have published, namely:

Details of the Lampion release 212
The single task of the first DLL is just to unzip the 2nd one with a hardcoded password. As
usual, the DLL inside soprateste.zip carries a message in Chinese for researchers:

the unzip process.

As usual, the trojan maintains intact its EAT since 2019. The call “DoThisBicht” is invoked
from the DLL loader, and the malware starts its malicious activity. Figure 11 below shows the
comparison of the EAT between the different versions from 2019 to 2022, and no differences
were noticed.

Lampion trojan itself).
The target brands are the same observed in the past campaigns, with the focus on Brazilian
and Portuguese banking organizations.

When started, the trojan collects information about the opened processes on the target
machine. If the title of the pages matches the hardcoded strings presented above, then it
starts the malicious overlay process that presents fake messages and windows
impersonating the target bank to lure the victims.

As mentioned, Lampion is using the same C2 server geolocated in Russia at least for two
years. Figure 14 compares the Lampion release 207 – from 2020 – and the new release 212
– February 2022. As presented, the server “5.188.9.28” has been used at least since 2020
by the criminals’ gang in order to orchestrate all the operations.

Figure 14: Lampion is using the same C2 server observed in 2020 and gelocated in Russia.
Interestingly, the C2 server – a Windows machine – has the Microsoft RPC Endpoint Mapper
service exposed, which allows mapping some of the services running on the machine,
associated pipes, hostname, etc.
Through this information, it was possible to obtain the hostname of the remote machine:
\WIN-344VU98D3RU.
After a quick search, the hostname seems to have already been associated with other
malicious groups operating different types of malware, such as the bazaar (see the article
here), and also LockBit 2.0 ransomware (take a look here).

Figure 15: IoCs related to the hostname used by Lampions C2 server (\WIN344VU98D3RU).
Although it is not possible to confirm whether this is a hostname associated with other Cloud
machines and used by legitimate systems, it was possible to identify that there are machines
spread all over the world with the same hostname, and in some situations, only a few
machines available per country.
In total, 81.503 machines were identified, with around 45k in The Netherlands, 25k in Russia,
2.5k Turkey, 2K Ukraine, 1.5k in US, etc.

Final Thoughts
Malware is one of the major cyber weapons to destroy a business, market reputation, and
even infect a wide number of users for the most malicious purposes. The next list presents
some tips on how you can prevent a malware infection. It is not a complete list, it is just a few
steps to protect yourself and your devices.
Keep software updated
Take several minutes to look at the new email and not just a few seconds. Analyze it
carefully
Beware of fake tech support, emails related to bank transactions, invoices, COVID19,
everything you think be strange
Keep Internet activity relevant
Log out at the end of the day
Only access secured and trusted sites; not only websites with a green lock. Criminals
are using free CAs to created valid HTTPS certificates.
Keep your operating system up to date
Make sure you are using an antivírus
Beware of malvertising

Be proactive and start taking malware protection seriously!
