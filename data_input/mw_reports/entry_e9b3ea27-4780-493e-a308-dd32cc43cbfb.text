September 6, 2021

In July 2021, KELA observed threat actors creating multiple threads where they claimed they
are ready to buy accesses and described their conditions. Some of them appear to use
access for deploying info-stealing malware and carrying out other malicious activities. Others
aim to plant ransomware and steal data. KELA explored what is valuable for threat actors
buying accesses, especially ransomware attackers, and built a profile of an ideal
ransomware victim.
Bottom line up front:
In July 2021, KELA found 48 active threads where actors claimed they are
looking to buy different kinds of accesses. 46% of them were created in that month,
illustrating the demand for access listings.
40% of the actors who were looking to buy accesses were identified as active
participants in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) supply chain – operators, or
affiliates, or middlemen.

Ransomware attackers appear to form “industry standards” defining an ideal victim
based on its revenue and geography and excluding certain sectors and countries from
the targets list. On average, the actors active in July 2021 aimed to buy access to
US companies with revenue of more than 100 million USD. Almost half of them
refused to buy access to companies from the healthcare and education
industries.
Ransomware attackers are ready to buy all kinds of network accesses, with RDP and
VPN being the most basic requirement. The most common products (enabling
network access) mentioned were Citrix, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Fortinet,
and Cisco.
Ransomware attackers are ready to pay for access up to 100,000 USD, with most
actors setting the boundaries at half of that price – 56,250 USD.
The similarities between ransomware-related actors’ requirements for victims and
access listings and conditions for IABs illustrate that RaaS operations act just like
corporate enterprises.

What Access Are Threat Actors Chasing
In total, KELA found 48 threads dedicated to buying accesses that were created or observed
being active in July 2021. Almost half of them were created in July alone, showing an
impressive pace and demand for access listings (with active meaning they had one or more

updates from their creators in a thread). It begs the question – what access are the actors
looking for and what is their ultimate goal?

First of all, it is important to understand that threat actors behind the announcements do not
necessarily mean network access when they say “access”. It is a term that is used in a very
loose manner to describe multiple different vectors and entry points – from SQL injection and
webshells to RDP- and VPN- based access. Analyzing the active threads dedicated to
buying accesses, KELA found that in addition to initial network accesses sold by Initial
Access Brokers (IABs), they included access to online shops’ panels, unprotected
databases, Microsoft Exchange servers, and more. All these types of access are
undoubtedly dangerous and can enable threat actors to perform various malicious actions,
but they rarely provide access to a corporate network.

Therefore, researching the actors’ demands and their dark web activity, KELA determined
that the actors behind the analyzed threads usually intended to exploit the access for all
kinds of malicious activities, including information-stealing (from deploying info-stealing
malware to injecting malicious scripts into websites), cryptocurrency mining, spam and
phishing campaigns.

However, one threat obviously stands out. Almost 40% of the analyzed threads were
created by actors related to Raas supply chain – operators, affiliates, or middlemen.
As ransomware operations have been growing and maturing, KELA observed multiple
ransomware gangs using the IABs’ services. Announcements about buying accesses help
them to find each other and cooperate further. Some gangs, like BlackMatter and Avos, even
sent an advertisement about them buying accesses in Jabber – apparently to all users
registered via XSS/Exploit Jabber services. Others, like Crylock ransomware representative,
specifically mentioned they are looking for constant sellers.

Such posts are not new, though with the growth and diversification of the ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) ecosystem they have become much more standardized. Instead of a simple
“I’ll buy access”, threat actors now scrupulously list potential victims’ characteristics and
types of access, knowing exactly what they want – i.e. to ease the attack and eventually
receive a ransom. KELA explored these metrics to find out what companies are in the
ransomware attackers’ target list.

Ransomware Attackers’ Requirements to IABs
When describing the pricing model formed by IABs, KELA determined that it mainly depends
on the revenue and the size of the affected company, though geography sometimes plays a
certain role. The level of privileges in the compromised network also influences the prices
(for example, a domain administrator account costs at least 10 times more than access to a
machine with user rights). Logically, the same metrics are important to ransomware actors
since IABs have always followed the needs of their customers.
A typical ransomware actors’ advertisement includes the following characteristics of the
victim:
Geography
The majority of requests mentioned the desired location of victims, with the US being the
most popular choice – 47% of the actors mentioned it. Other top locations included
Canada (37%), Australia (37%), and European countries (31%). Most of the
advertisements included a call for multiple countries. The reason behind this geographical
focus is that actors choose the most wealthy companies which are expected to be located in
the biggest and the most developed countries. For example, the LockBit 2.0 ransomware
representative said in his recent interview: “The bigger the company’s capitalization is – the
better. <..> It does not matter where the target is situated, we attack everyone.”

Revenue
Typically, the actors stated only the minimum desired revenue in attempts to cut off victims
that are unlikely to pay a significant ransom. The average minimum revenue wanted by
ransomware attackers is 100 million USD, with some of them stating that the desired
revenue depends on the location. For example, one of the actors described the following
formula: revenue should be more than 5 million USD for US victims, more than 20 million
USD for European victims, and more than 40 million USD for “the third world” countries.

Blacklist of sectors
A significant difference can be spotted between the advertisement of threat actors buying
access for ransomware attacks and cybercriminals with other specializations. Almost a half
of ransomware-related threads included a blacklist of sectors, meaning that the actors are
not ready to buy access to companies from specific industries.
47% of ransomware attackers refused to buy access to companies from the healthcare
and education industries. 37% prohibited compromising the government sector, while
26% claimed they will not purchase access related to non-profit organizations. When
actors prohibit healthcare or non-profit industries offers, it is more likely due to the moral
code of the actors. When the education sector is off the table, the reason is the same or the
fact that education victims simply cannot afford to pay much. Finally, when actors refuse to
target government companies, it is a precaution measure and an attempt to avoid unwanted
attention from law enforcement.

Blacklist of countries
Finally, some countries are out of ransomware attackers’ interests. Not surprisingly, it’s CIS,
according to the old Russian-speaking hackers’ rule “do not work in Ru” [in Russian speaking
countries – KELA]. The actors based in CIS suppose that if they will not target these
countries, local authorities will not hunt them. Other countries mentioned as “unwanted”
included South America and third world countries – most likely due to low chances of getting
a financial gain.

Ransomware Attackers Budget for Accesses
For suitable victims, ransomware attackers are ready to buy all kinds of network accesses,
with RDP and VPN being the most basic requirement. Among wanted products (enabling
network access) they listed Citrix, Palo Alto Networks (specifically GlobalProtect
VPN), VMware (specifically ESXi), Fortinet, and Cisco. As for the level of privileges, some
attackers stated they prefer domain admin rights, though it does not seem to be critical.

How much are ransomware attackers ready to pay for such access to defined
companies? The range really varies, starting from 100 and ending with 100,000 USD.
The average minimum and maximum prices for access are 1600 – 56,250 USD. In
addition, 32% of ransomware attackers are ready to pay a share of a ransom. As KELA
determined earlier, IABs can get around 10% of a ransom.
The similarities between ransomware-related actors’ requirements for victims and
access listings and conditions for IABs illustrate that RaaS operations act just like
corporate enterprises. They form “ industry standards” with a blacklist of sectors and
countries, define their “clients” revenue and geography, and offer a competitive price for
threat actors supplying them the desired “goods.” Confronting such organized cybercrime
requires more effort and visibility into the sources where ransomware-related actors look for
outsourcing services and recruit partners and employees.

Mitigation measures for enterprise defenders
Demand for access listings on cybercrime forums is growing, with more actors advertising
they are ready to buy entry points to networks, sites, storage, and more. This is another
proof of continuing servitization of cybercrime, especially ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
operations that rely on different specialists to perform their attacks. However, it is crucial to
remember that access to a company in the wrong hands may be exploited not only for
deploying ransomware and stealing data but also for other malicious campaigns.

Confronting various threats require enterprise defenders to invest in:
1. Cybersecurity awareness and training for all key stakeholders and employees to
ensure that key individuals know how to safely use their credentials and personal
information online. This cyber training should include specifying how to identify
suspicious activities, such as possible scam emails, or unusual requests from
unauthorized individuals or email addresses.
2. Regular vulnerability monitoring and patching to continually protect their entire network
infrastructure and prevent any unauthorized access by Initial Access Brokers or other
network intruders.
3. Targeted and automated monitoring of key assets to immediately detect threats
emerging from the cybercrime underground ecosystem. Constant automated and
scalable monitoring of an organization’s assets could significantly improve maintaining
a reduced attack surface, ultimately helping organizations thwart possible attempts of
cyberattacks against them.
