In May 2016, the Bitdefender threat response team isolated several samples from the
internal malware zoo while looking into a custom file-packing algorithm. A deeper look into
our global telemetry revealed that this piece of malware was strictly affecting a limited pool
of hosts belonging to a number of IP addresses marked as sensitive targets.
Its unusual build could have easily made it pass for a regular threat like many of those that
organizations block on a daily basis; however, telemetry information provided by our event
correlation service has pointed out that most of its victims are government agencies. Paired
with advanced spear phishing techniques and the malware’s primary focus to collect
intelligence and exfiltrate it systematically, we presume that this attack is part of a high-level
cyber-espionage campaign.
The piece of malware we look at in this report comes with quite an array of methods to steal
information, ranging from keylogging to password and cookie theft. It is built around a
legitimate, yet controversial recovery toolkit provided by Nirsoft. The controversy stems
from the fact that the applications provided by Nirsoft are used to recover cached
passwords or monitor network traffic via powerful command-line interfaces that can be
instructed to run completely covertly. For a long time now, the antimalware industry has
flagged the tools provided by Nirsoft as potential threats to security specifically because
they are extremely easy to abuse, and oversimplify the creation of powerful malware.
Even though the Netrepser malware uses free tools and utilities to carry various jobs to
completion, the technical complexity of the attack, as well as the targets attacked, suggest
that Netrepser is more than a commercial-grade tool.
