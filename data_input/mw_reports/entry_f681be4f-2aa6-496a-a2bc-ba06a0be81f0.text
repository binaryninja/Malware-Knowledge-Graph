February 2, 2022

Our discovery and analysis of a sophisticated Mac trojan in October exposed a year-long evolution of
a malware family—and depicts the rising complexity of threats across platforms. The trojan, tracked
as UpdateAgent, started as a relatively basic information-stealer but was observed distributing
secondary payloads in the latest campaign, a capability that it added in one of its multiple iterations.
Reminiscent of the progression of info-stealing trojans in other platforms, UpdateAgent may similarly
become a vector for other threats to infiltrate target systems.
Since its first appearance in September 2020, the malware displayed an increasing progression of
sophisticated capabilities, and while the latest two variants were sporting much more refined
behavior compared with earlier versions, they show signs that the malware is still in the development
stage and more updates are likely to come. The latest campaign saw the malware installing the
evasive and persistent Adload adware, but UpdateAgent’s ability to gain access to a device can
theoretically be further leveraged to fetch other, potentially more dangerous payloads.
UpdateAgent lures its victims by impersonating legitimate software and can leverage Mac device
functionalities to its benefit. One of the most advanced techniques found in UpdateAgent’s latest
toolbox is bypassing Gatekeeper controls, which are designed to ensure only trusted apps run on
Mac devices. The trojan can leverage existing user permissions to quietly perform malicious activities
before deleting the evidence to cover its tracks. UpdateAgent also misuses public cloud
infrastructure, namely Amazon S3 and CloudFront services, to host its additional payloads. We
shared our findings with the team at Amazon Web Services, and they have taken down the malicious
URLs–another example of how intelligence sharing and collaboration results in better security for the
broader community.
Threats like UpdateAgent are proof that, as environments continue to rely on a diverse range of
devices and operating systems, organizations need security solutions that can provide protection
across platforms and a complete picture of their security posture. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
delivers and coordinates threat defense across all major OS platforms including Windows, macOS,
Linux, Android and iOS. On macOS devices, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects and exposes
threats and vulnerabilities through its antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat
and vulnerability management capabilities.
In this blog post, we share the evolving development of the UpdateAgent trojan targeting Mac users
and detail the malware’s recent campaign to compromise devices, steal sensitive information, and
distribute adware as a secondary payload.

Progression of UpdateAgent
UpdateAgent is uniquely characterized by its gradual upgrading of persistence techniques, a key
feature that indicates this trojan will likely continue to use more sophisticated techniques in future
campaigns. Like many information-stealers found on other platforms, the malware attempts to

infiltrate macOS machines to steal data and it is associated with other types of malicious payloads,
increasing the chances of multiple infections on a device.
The trojan is likely distributed via drive-by downloads or advertisement pop-ups, which impersonate
legitimate software such as video applications and support agents. This action of impersonating or
bundling itself with legitimate software increases the likelihood that users are tricked into installing
the malware. Once installed, UpdateAgent starts to collect system information that is then sent to its
command-and-control (C2) server.
Notably, the malware’s developer has periodically updated the trojan over the last year to improve
upon its initial functions and add new capabilities to the trojan’s toolbox. The timeline below illustrates
a series of techniques adopted by UpdateAgent from September 2020 through October 2021:

Figure 1. Tracking the evolution of UpdateAgent
September–December 2020: The initial version of UpdateAgent was considered to be a fairly
basic information-stealer. At the time, the malware was only capable of performing
reconnaissance to scan and collect system information such as product names and versions.
Once gathered, the data was then sent as heartbeats to the malware’s C2 server.
January–February 2021: Approximately two months later, UpdateAgent maintained its original
capabilities and added a new one: the ability to fetch secondary payloads as .dmg files from
public cloud infrastructure. DMG files are mountable disk images used to distribute software
and apps to macOS, allowing the trojan to easily install additional programs on affected
devices.

March 2021: Upon its third update, the malware altered one of its prior functions to fetch
secondary payloads as .zip files instead of .dmg files. The malware’s developer also included
two new capabilities: the ability to bypass Gatekeeper by removing the downloaded file’s
quarantine attribute and the ability to create a PLIST file that is added to the LaunchAgent
folder. The quarantine attribute forces Gatekeeper to block the launch of any file downloaded
from the web or other unknown sources, and it also displays a pop-up warning that users
cannot open the respective file as “it is from an unidentified developer”. By removing the
attribute, the malware both prevented the pop-up message warning users and allowed the files
to launch without being blocked by Gatekeeper. Moreover, as the LaunchAgent folder specifies
which apps and code automatically run each time a user signs into the machine, adding the
malware’s PLIST file allowed it to be included in these automatic launches for persistence upon
users signing into the affected device.
August 2021: The malware’s fourth update further altered some of its prior capabilities. For
one, it expanded its reconnaissance function to scan and collect System_profile and
SPHardwaretype information. Additionally, UpdateAgent was changed to create and add PLIST
files to the LaunchDaemon folder instead of the LaunchAgent folder. While targeting the
LaunchDaemon folder instead of the LaunchAgent folder required administrative privileges, it
permitted the malware to inject persistent code that ran as root. This code generally takes the
form of background processes that don’t interact with users, thus it also improved the trojan’s
evasiveness.
October 2021: We detected the latest variants of UpdateAgent just over a year since its
release into the wild. Sporting many of the updates found in the August 2021 variant,
UpdateAgent still performed system reconnaissance, communicated with the C2 server as
heartbeats, and bypassed Gatekeeper. Additionally, the October update expanded the
malware’s ability to fetch secondary payloads as both .dmg or .zip files from public cloud
infrastructure, rather than choosing between filetypes. Among its new capabilities, UpdateAgent
included the ability to enumerate LSQuarantineDataURLString using SQLite in order to validate
whether the malware’s downloaded app is within the Quarantine Events database where it
would be assigned a quarantine attribute. The upgrade also allowed the malware to leverage
existing user profiles to run commands requiring sudo access in addition to the ability to add
arguments using PlistBuddy to create and edit PLIST files more easily. Lastly, the trojan
included the ability to modify sudoers list, allowing the malware to bypass a prompt requiring
high privilege user credentials while running UpdateAgent’s downloaded app.

October 2021 Campaign
In the October 2021 campaign, UpdateAgent included a larger set of sophisticated techniques than
ever previously observed. The attackers distributed the trojanized app in .zip or .pkg format,
conforming with a campaign observed in early 2021:

Figure 2. Attack chain of the latest UpdateAgent campaign
Upon analyzing UpdateAgent’s infrastructure, we determined that the infrastructure used in the
October 2021 campaign was created at the end of September 2021, and we also discovered
additional domains with payloads. This indicates that the trojan is still in the developmental stage and
is likely to add or modify its capabilities in future updates and continue its track of improving its
overall level of sophistication.
We further observed two separate variants of the UpdateAgent trojan in its October 2021 campaign.
Each variant leveraged different tactics to infect a device, as detailed below:

Variant 1
The first variant of UpdateAgent takes the following steps to infect a device:
1. A .zip file named HelperModule.zip downloads and installs UpdateAgent using a specific file
path – /Library/Application Support/xxx/xxx. This .zip file is installed in /Library/Application
Support/Helper/HelperModule.
2. UpdateAgent collects operating system and hardware information about the affected device.
Once the compromised device connects to the C2 server, the trojan uses a curl request to send
this data to the C2 server.
3. Upon successful connection, UpdateAgent requests a secondary payload, usually a .dmg or
.zip file, which is hosted on a CloudFront instance.
4. Once the secondary payload downloads, UpdateAgent uses the xattr command – /usr/bin/xattr
-rc /tmp/setup.dmg, to remove the quarantine attribute of downloaded files and bypass
Gatekeeper controls.
5. UpdateAgent then extracts the secondary payload (.dmg or .zip). Once the file is mounted, it
unzips and copies the payload files to a temporary folder, assigning executable permissions,
and launches these files. UpdateAgent also uses PlistBuddy to create PLIST files under the
LaunchAgent folder to remain persistent through system restart.
6. UpdateAgent removes evidence by deleting the secondary payload, temporary folders, PLIST
files, and all other downloaded artifacts.

Variant 2
4/9

The second variant of UpdateAgent takes the following steps to infect a device:
1. A third-party WebVideoPlayer application (WebVideoPlayer.pkg) with a post-install script
downloads additional apps or .zip files as
/Applications/WebVideoPlayer.app/Contents/MacOS/WebVideoPlayer. Notably, this application
included a valid certificate that was later revoked by Apple in October 2021.
2. The application scans the user profile to identify existing user IDs and assigned groups.
3. The WebVideoPlayer application uses SQLite3 commands to determine if the .pkg file is within
the Quarantine Events database, which contains URLs of downloaded files, mail addresses,
and subjects for saved attachments.
4. The .pkg payload extracts and drops UpdateAgent in /Library/Application
Support/WebVideoPlayer/WebVideoPlayerAgent.
5. The WebVideoPlayer application also assigns executable permissions to UpdateAgent and
attempts to remove the quarantine attribute of the file using the xattr command to bypass
Gatekeeper controls.
6. The application then launches UpdateAgent and collects and sends the OS information to the
attacker’s C2 server. Like the first variant, the second variant sends curl requests that download
additional payloads, such as adware, and removes evidence by deleting all files and folders
that it created.

Adload adware
UpdateAgent is further characterized by its ability to fetch secondary payloads that can increase the
chances of multiple infections on a device, with the latest campaign pushing adware. We first
observed UpdateAgent distributing adware as a secondary payload in its October 2021 campaign,
identified as part of the Adload adware family by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
Similar to UpdateAgent, adware is often included in potentially unwanted or malicious software
bundles that install the adware alongside impersonated or legitimate copies of free programs. In
Adload’s case, we previously observed the adware family targeting macOS users had spread via
rogue installers often found on malicious websites.
Once adware is installed, it uses ad injection software and techniques to intercept a device’s online
communications and redirect users’ traffic through the adware operators’ servers, injecting
advertisements and promotions into webpages and search results. More specifically, Adload
leverages a Person-in-The-Middle (PiTM) attack by installing a web proxy to hijack search engine
results and inject advertisements into webpages, thereby siphoning ad revenue from official website
holders to the adware operators.
Adload is also an unusually persistent strain of adware. It is capable of opening a backdoor to
download and install other adware and payloads in addition to harvesting system information that is
sent to the attackers’ C2 servers. Considering both UpdateAgent and Adload have the ability to
install additional payloads, attackers can leverage either or both of these vectors to potentially deliver
more dangerous threats to target systems in future campaigns.

Defending against macOS threats

5/9

UpdateAgent’s evolution displays the increasing complexity of threats across platforms. Its
developers steadily improved the trojan over the last year, turning a basic information-stealer into a
persistent and more sophisticated piece of malware. This threat also exemplifies the trend of
common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other
platforms. UpdateAgent’s ability to gain access to a device can theoretically be leveraged by
attackers to introduce potentially more dangerous payloads, emphasizing the need to identify and
block threats such as this.
Defenders can take the following mitigation steps to defend against this threat:
Encourage the use of Microsoft Edge—available on macOS and various platforms—or other
web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks
malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that contain exploits and host
malware.
Restrict access to privileged resources, such as LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents folders and
sudoers files, through OSX enterprise management solutions. This helps to mitigate common
persistence and privilege escalation techniques.
Install apps from trusted sources only, such as a software platform’s official app store. Thirdparty sources may have lax standards for the applications that they host, allowing malicious
actors to upload and distribute malware.
Run the latest version of your operating systems and applications. Deploy the latest security
updates as soon as they become available.
As organizational environments are intricate and heterogenous, running multiple applications, clouds,
and devices, they require solutions that can protect across platforms. Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint offers cross-platform security and a unified investigation experience that gives customers
visibility across all endpoints and enables them to detect, manage, respond, and remediate threats,
such as the capability to detect UpdateAgent’s anomalous use of PlistBuddy.
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers can apply the following mitigations to reduce the
environmental attack surface and mitigate the impact of this threat and its payloads:
Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft
Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly
identify and stop new and unknown threats.
Enable potentially unwanted application (PUA) protection in block mode to automatically
quarantine PUAs like adware. PUA blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the next
signature update or computer restart. PUA blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the
next signature update or computer restart.
Turn on network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses.
Defender for Endpoint’s next-generation protection reinforces network security perimeters and
includes antimalware capabilities to catch emerging threats, including UpdateAgent and its
secondary payloads, C2 communications, and other malicious artifacts affiliated with the trojan’s
reconnaissance activities. Moreover, macOS antimalware detections provide insight into where a
threat originated and how the malicious process or activity was created, providing security teams a
comprehensive view of incidents and attack chains.

Finally, this research underscores the importance of understanding a macOS threat’s progression to
not only remedy its current abilities, but to prepare for increased capabilities and sophistication of the
threat. As threats on other OS platforms continue to grow, our security solutions must secure users’
computing experiences be it a Windows or non-Windows machine. By sharing our research and
other forms of threat intelligence, collaboration across the larger security community can aid in
enriching our protection technologies, regardless of the platform or device in use.
