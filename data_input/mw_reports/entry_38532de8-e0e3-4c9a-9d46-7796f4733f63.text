Arid Gopher sticks its head out from its burrow

The folks at Deep Instinct say they have studied a Go-written variant of the malware used by
the Arid Viper cyber-crime ring.
Deep Instinct, founded in 2015, says it uses deep learning to detect and block malware.
While training a deep-learning model that's focused on identifying software nasties written in
Go, the researchers uncovered an executable file built using the programming language,
submitted it to the VirusTotal website, and found only six security vendors had the binary
flagged as malicious.

Further investigation uncovered two similar Go-written binaries. From these programs, we're
told, it became clear the team were looking at a variant of Micropsia. This malware was
identified in 2017 and is used exclusively by Arid Viper, an advanced persistent threat (APT)
group believed to be based in Gaza and known as APT-C-23. Deep Instinct named the Gowritten malware Arid Gopher.
"This new variant is still being developed; all the three files share a common baseline, but
each file contains unique code which is not present in the other files," Deep Instinct
researchers Simon Kenin and Asaf Gilboa wrote in an analysis this Monday. "Beside the
main implant, our investigation revealed a 'helper' malware, also written in Go, and a secondstage malware which was downloaded from the C2 [command-and-control] server."
Essentially, Arid Gopher has the same functionality of Arid Viper; it is simply written in the Go
language.
"This is also how we related it to Arid Viper," Moshe Hayun, Deep Instinct's threat intelligence
team leader, told The Register. "We used code similarities and functionality similarities. This
is how we found out it's the same actor, using the decompiler, reverse engineering, and
looking into the functionalities and how it does things."
Kenin told The Register that writing the code in Go was likely a way to bypass detection. It's
not unusual to see threat groups shift the programming language they use to keep malware
under the radar. In its 2022 Cyber Threat Landscape Report released in February, Deep
Instinct said that in 2021 it saw a shift by gangs away from older languages like C and C++
to newer ones, including Python and Go, which are easy to learn.
Antivirus engines may be unfamiliar with the structure or identities of executables produced
from these newer languages; a binary built from C++ may be in a malware database, but the
binary of a rewrite in Go may not be, buying its creators some extra time to avoid detection. It
could also be cyber-crooks are just keeping up with software development trends, tools, and
libraries.
In Arid Viper's case, its masterminds have used a range of programming languages, jumping
from Pascal and Delphi to C++, Python, and now Go. What hasn't changed is how the
malware works or what it is designed to do.
"APTs, their sole purpose is to infiltrate important assets," Hayun said. "I don't know if I have
seen an APT transposing from so many languages, like Delphi [and] Pascal, but Go malware
is kind of a trend now because it's a new language, it has a lot of open-source libraries, a lot
of libraries like helper functions to collect information from the victim's computers and stuff
like that. I don't know how unique it is. APTs do that. Their models are out there in several
languages. I don't recall anyone APT using these exact languages or transposing it to Go."

According to Deep Instinct, Arid Viper's malware targets computers running Microsoft
Windows, and has been used primarily in the Middle East, with a specific focus on
Palestinian targets. It has been linked in the past to Hamas, according to the researchers.
There also is an Android strain apparently used against Israeli targets, and last year
Facebook-owner Meta issued a report [PDF] that identified an iOS nasty developed by Arid
Viper.
Deep Instinct outlined the Arid Gopher variants it uncovered. Arid Gopher V1 is written in Go
1.16.5gs and includes code from libraries available from GitHub, which the researchers
noted "saves the author time by not needing to write some features from scratch. It also adds
some degree of legitimacy because those libraries are not malicious, but the malware author
abuses the libraries' capabilities for malicious purposes."
There are two versions of the Arid Gopher V2 variant that have been used since the
beginning of the year. Both samples were written in Go 1.17.4 and use some of the public
libraries from GitHub that are in V1. A key difference between the two is the content of the
benign documents they save on a victim's desktop, the team wrote. The variants are emailed
to targets in .xz RAR archives, and unpack with a long filename to hopefully push their .exe
extension out of sight. When successfully run, they infect the host Windows PC, open a
backdoor to a command-and-control server to receive further instructions, and drop a decoy
document on the desktop and display it so that the victim thinks they've simply saved and
opened an attached Word file and not malware.
The variants also continue Arid Viper's use of names of characters in popular TV shows in
their domain names. In V1, the name Grace Fraser is used in a domain name. Grace Fraser
is a character in the HBO series The Undoing. In V2, a name used is Pam Beesly, a
character from the sitcom The Office.
Gilboa and Kenin claim deep learning gives them an edge over rival cybersecurity vendors in
finding malicious code. The researchers wrote that some competitors rely on manually tuned
heuristics, or manually selected features that are fed into classical machine-learning models,
to determine if a file is malicious or legitimate. Other methods include running programs in a
sandbox to get more information.
Deep Instinct instead trains models to learn as they go.
"Researchers are manually going over samples and then are updating their signature
mechanism," Hayun said. "We do it a bit differently. We take huge amounts of data, so there
is a really high probability that our deep learning models already saw something similar.
"They say, 'I saw something similar. I know that this and this and this will increase the
probability of something being malicious,' so the next time something a bit similar comes into
the model, it will say, 'I saw something similar like this. I will give it the highest quality to be
this as malicious.'" ®

Big Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation
Study claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules
Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public
statements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common
organizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.
That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the
corporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown
state privacy bills.
The report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy

SEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake
Meanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors
Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC
America's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed
his purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media
company hangs in the balance.
A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he "[did] not appear"
to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter "required 10 days
from the date of acquisition," and asked him to provide more information. Musk's
shares made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders.
Musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth
over $44 billion. Musk sold a chunk of his shares in Tesla worth $8.4 billion and bagged
another $7.14 billion from investors to help finance the $21 billion he promised to put
forward for the deal. The remaining $25.5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, and others. But the takeover is not going
smoothly.

Cloud security unicorn cuts 20% of staff after raising $1.3b
Time to play blame bingo: Markets? Profits? Too much growth? Russia? Space aliens?
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 19:19 UTC 2
Cloud security company Lacework has laid off 20 percent of its employees, just months
after two record-breaking funding rounds pushed its valuation to $8.3 billion.
A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the total number of employees affected, though told
The Register that the "widely speculated number on Twitter is a significant
overestimate."
The company, as of March, counted more than 1,000 employees, which would push
the jobs lost above 200. And the widely reported number on Twitter is about 300
employees. The biz, based in Silicon Valley, was founded in 2015.

Talos names eight deadly sins in widely used industrial software
Entire swaths of gear relies on vulnerability-laden Open Automation Software (OAS)
Jeff Burt Fri 27 May 2022 // 18:30 UTC
A researcher at Cisco's Talos threat intelligence team found eight vulnerabilities in the
Open Automation Software (OAS) platform that, if exploited, could enable a bad actor
to access a device and run code on a targeted system.
The OAS platform is widely used by a range of industrial enterprises, essentially
facilitating the transfer of data within an IT environment between hardware and
software and playing a central role in organizations' industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
efforts. It touches a range of devices, including PLCs and OPCs and IoT devices, as
well as custom applications and APIs, databases and edge systems.
Companies like Volvo, General Dynamics, JBT Aerotech and wind-turbine maker AES

Despite global uncertainty, $500m hit doesn't rattle Nvidia execs
CEO acknowledges impact of war, pandemic but says fundamentals ‘are really good’
Dylan Martin Fri 27 May 2022 // 16:08 UTC 1
Nvidia is expecting a $500 million hit to its global datacenter and consumer business in
the second quarter due to COVID lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Despite those and other macroeconomic concerns, executives are still
optimistic about future prospects.
"The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is
difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities
remain unchanged," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO and co-founder, during the
company's first-quarter earnings call.
Those two statements might sound a little contradictory, including to some investors,
particularly following the stock selloff yesterday after concerns over Russia and China
prompted Nvidia to issue lower-than-expected guidance for second-quarter revenue.

That's the second in a week following similar system in Munich also aimed at
researchers
Dan Robinson Fri 27 May 2022 // 15:30 UTC
HPE is lifting the lid on a new AI supercomputer – the second this week – aimed at
building and training larger machine learning models to underpin research.
Based at HPE's Center of Excellence in Grenoble, France, the new supercomputer is
to be named Champollion after the French scholar who made advances in deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 19th century. It was built in partnership with Nvidia using
AMD-based Apollo computer nodes fitted with Nvidia's A100 GPUs.
Champollion brings together HPC and purpose-built AI technologies to train machine
learning models at scale and unlock results faster, HPE said. HPE already provides
HPC and AI resources from its Grenoble facilities for customers, and the broader
research community to access, and said it plans to provide access to Champollion for
scientists and engineers globally to accelerate testing of their AI models and research.

Microsoft slows some hiring for Windows, Teams, and Office
'Making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity' ahead of next
fiscal year
Richard Speed Fri 27 May 2022 // 13:31 UTC 4
Microsoft has hit the brakes on hiring in some key product areas as the company
prepares for the next fiscal year and all that might bring.
According to reports in the Bloomberg, the unit that develops Windows, Office, and
Teams is affected and while headcount remains expected to grow, new hires in that
division must first be approved by bosses.
During a talk this week at JP Morgan's Technology, Media and Communications
Conference, Rajesh Jha, executive VP for the Office Product Group, noted that within
three years he expected approximately two-thirds of CIOs to standardize on Microsoft
Teams. 1.4 billion PCs were running Windows. He also remarked: "We have lots of
room here to grow the seats with Office 365."

GitHub saved plaintext passwords of npm users in log files, post mortem reveals
Unrelated to the OAuth token attack, but still troubling as org reveals details of around
100,000 users were grabbed by the baddies
Richard Speed Fri 27 May 2022 // 12:15 UTC 7
GitHub has revealed it stored a "number of plaintext user credentials for the npm
registry" in internal logs following the integration of the JavaScript package registry into
GitHub's logging systems.
The information came to light when the company today published the results of its
investigation into April's unrelated OAuth token theft attack, where it described how an
attacker grabbed data including the details of approximately 100,000 npm users.
The code shack went on to assure users that the relevant log files had not been leaked
in any data breach; that it had improved the log cleanup; and that it removed the logs in
question "prior to the attack on npm."
