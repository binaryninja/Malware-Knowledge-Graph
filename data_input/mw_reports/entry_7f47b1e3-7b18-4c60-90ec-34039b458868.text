Counterintelligence Team

Prevailion’s Adversarial Counterintelligence Team and Accenture’s Cyber Defense group are
teaming up to jointly utilize their respective proprietary data and expert analysis to deliver
timely and in-depth security research. Our goal is to provide insights into threat actor tactics,
targets, and campaigns to deliver actionable detection and mitigation opportunities to
defenders.
Accenture’s Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) group and Prevailion’s Adversarial
Counterintelligence Team (PACT) dug into recently publicized campaigns of the cyber
espionage threat group Lyceum (aka HEXANE, Spirlin) to further analyze the operational
infrastructure and victimology of this actor. The team’s findings corroborate and reinforce
previous ClearSky and Kaspersky research indicating a primary focus on computer network
intrusion events aimed at telecommunications providers in the Middle East. Additionally, the
research expands on this victim set by identifying additional targets within internet service
providers (ISPs) and government agencies. Although all victim-identifying information has
been redacted, this report seeks to provide these targeted industry and geographic verticals
with additional knowledge of the threat and mitigation opportunities.
Findings:
The ACTI/PACT team made the following key findings:
Between July and October 2021, Lyceum backdoors appear to have targeted ISPs and
telecommunication operators in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia as well as a
ministry of foreign affairs (MFA) in Africa.
At least two of the identified compromises are assessed to be ongoing despite prior
public disclosure of indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Domain name system (DNS) tunneling appears to be used only during the early stages
of backdoor deployment; subsequently, the Lyceum operators use the HTTP(S)
command and control (C2) functionality encoded in the backdoors.
Methodology:
From an offset in the comprehensive analysis by ClearSky and Kaspersky, ACTI and PACT
have conducted research on these campaigns based on Prevailion’s network telemetry
overlaid with ACTI’s technical understanding of Lyceum backdoor communication.
The joint ACTI/PACT research team was able to identify additional web-based infrastructure
used by Lyceum, which corroborated previous reporting and identified six domains with a
previously unknown connection to Lyceum (five of which are currently registered). This
research eventually fueled Prevailion’s ability to annex over 20 Lyceum domains, which
provided network telemetry of ongoing compromises. Analysis of this telemetry, enriched and
corroborated with host-based data, allowed the team to identify additional victims and
provide further visibility into Lyceum’s targeting methodology.
Victimology:
2/13

Active since 2017, Lyceum targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance,
including oil and gas organizations and telecommunications providers. ACTI/PACT assess
the targets for this campaign to be congruent with Lyceum’s previous activity, however, the
group has expanded its target set to include ISPs and government bodies.
ACTI/PACT identified victims within telecommunication companies and ISPs in Israel,
Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia as well as an MFA in Africa. Telecommunications
companies and ISPs are high-level targets for cyber espionage threat actors because once
compromised, they provide access to various organizations and subscribers in addition to
internal systems that can be used to leverage malicious behavior even further. Additionally,
companies within these industries can also be used by threat actors or their sponsors to
surveil individuals of interest. MFAs are also highly sought-after targets because they have
valuable intelligence on the current state of bilateral relationship and insight into future
dealings.
Investigation Summary:
During this campaign, Lyceum used two primary malware families, dubbed Shark and Milan
(a.k.a. James). The ACTI/PACT investigation focused on the C2 communication aspects that
analysts observed in Prevailion’s telemetry, since ClearSky and Kasperksy have already
provided detailed technical descriptions of the backdoors. Both backdoors can communicate
via DNS and HTTP(S) for C2 communication (see Detailed Technical Description below for
more information).
Shark produces a configuration file that contains at least one C2 domain, which is used with
a Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) for DNS tunneling or HTTP C2 communications. The
C2 domains’ authoritative name server is attacker controlled allowing Lyceum operators to
provide commands through IP-addresses in the A-records of DNS responses. Shark uses a
specific syntax when sending HTTP requests that enabled ACTI/PACT researchers to create
a regular expression – a combination of characters in strings that specify a search pattern –
to identify additional victims of the campaign. Using this regular expression, the researchers
were able to pivot from likely Israeli hosts to IP-addresses resolving to telecommunication
and ISPs in Israel and Saudi-Arabia. The backdoor had consistent beaconing at these
victims beginning in September through October 2021.
For C2 communications over DNS, Milan uses hardcoded domains as the input for a custom
DGA. The DGA is documented in Kaspersky’s report as is some of the syntax used by Milan
for C2 over HTTP(S). However, ACTI found that some of the legacy Milan backdoors retrieve
data by generating requests using the hard-coded domain and then requesting one of a
number Active Server Pages-related URL paths. These URL paths are hardcoded within
some of the Milan samples. Those identified by ACTI were:
contact.aspx
default.aspx
3/13

preview.aspx
team.aspx
When the ACTI/PACT team queried the Prevailion dataset for the above-referenced, known,
hard-coded URL paths observed in Milan samples, the team observed continued beaconing
in October from an IP address that resolved to a telecommunications operator in Morocco.
Following this investigation thread, the ACTI/PACT team identified beaconing from a
reconfigured or possibly a new Lyceum backdoor in late October 2021. The observed
beacons were seen egressing from a telecommunications company in Tunisia as well as an
MFA in Africa. The URL syntax of the newly reconfigured backdoor is similar to those
generated in the newer version of Milan, however because the URL syntax is configurable, it
is likely that the Lyceum operators reconfigured the URL syntax used by Milan to circumvent
intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that were encoded
to detect the previous Milan beacon syntax.
Outlook:
ACTI/PACT assess that Lyceum is likely updating its backdoors in light of recent public
research into its activities to try and stay ahead of defensive systems. The group has
continued its targeting of companies of national strategic importance. Lyceum will likely
continue to use the Shark and Milan backdoors, albeit with some modifications, as the group
has likely been able to maintain footholds in victims’ networks despite public disclosure of
IOCs associated with its operations.
To learn more about this threat actor and obtain additional behavioral analytics and detection
opportunities, please contact info@prevailion.com
Mitigation:
Accenture and Prevailion provide the following detection opportunities and IOCs to aid
enterprises within the targeted industries and verticals in detecting Lyceum activity.
Detection Opportunities for Shark:
Shark uses randomly generated directories to stage files for upload or after download. Below
is an example:
c:userslukedesktopwinlangdbdir468526d1102461

(See also Image 1 in the Detailed Technical Description)
The directories always appear to be appended by the filename of the Shark payload (e.g.,
winlangdbdir) and end with a 14-digit alphanumerical string (e.g., 468526d1102461).
Detection engineers or network defenders are encouraged to look for similar directories on
clients and servers in their networks.
4/13

Shark HTTP telemetry will match the following URL syntax:
//?q=[a-z0-9]{8}(-[a-z0-9]{4}){3}-[a-z0-9]{12}&qi=[A-Za-z0-9%]{16}&q1=/

The URL syntax used by the new or reconfigured Lyceum backdoor is matched by the
following regular expression:
//?(proto|kind|pt)=[0-9]{1}&(index|pi|serv)=/

Detection Opportunities for Milan:
Defenders can use the following YARA rule to sweep their filesystems for the presence of
Milan:

Detailed Technical Description:
ACTI/PACT will only provide a brief presentation of the malware families and will focus on the
C2 communication aspects that analysts observed in Prevailion’s telemetry, since ClearSky
and Kasperksy have already provided detailed technical descriptions of the Shark and Milan
(a.k.a. James) backdoors.
Shark:
Shark is a 32-bit executable written in C# and .NET. To run Shark, a parameter is passed on
the command line that includes the executable’s filename. Shark generates a mutex that
uses the executable’s filename as the mutex value. The mutex likely ensures Shark does not
execute on a machine where it is already running and that the correct version of Shark is
executed.
Shark does not use code to facilitate persistence; instead, Shark runs its functions as infinite
threads, which enables Shark to persist as long as the victim’s machine is turned on. The
developers likely designed Shark for clients or servers with high uptime or for machines to
which they have access and can re-launch the Shark executable if the machine is turned off.
Shark uses a function called “redus” to produce a configuration file that is XOR-encoded,
compressed with Gzip, and has the same name as the Shark executable. All files that ACTI
analyzed were XOR-encoded with the hexadecimal key 0x2a.

Image 1: Snip from Shark Configuration File
The configuration file contains at least one C2 domain, which is used with a DGA for DNS
tunneling or HTTP C2 communications. The C2 domains’ authoritative name server is
attacker-controlled, allowing Lyceum operators to provide commands through IP addresses
in the A records of DNS responses.
Specific parameters within the Shark backdoor configuration file indicate whether the
backdoor is to use DNS or HTTP for C2:
S1, S2: The configured C2 servers.
T1, T2: Sleep time values.

7/13

d1,u1,d2,u2: Staging folders for upload and download where different directories are
used depending on whether the upload or download occurs with DNS or HTTP.
When sending HTTP requests, Shark uses the following syntax:
http://maliciousdomain.com/?q=[GUID + (request type string)]&qi=[machine id (id
parameter from config]&q1=[machine name]&q2=[vr = "02" for all samples] &q3=
[HttpTimeOut(t2 parameter from config)]

The “q” parameter in the request always contains a new GUID for each request and has the
following strings appended depending on the request type:
s6rt – Beacon
xrtf – Download
o543n – Upload
The image below shows a beacon request type, as designated by the s6rt marked in the
upper blue box.

Image 2: Shark HTTP C2 Communication
To capture the Shark C2 syntax, the ACTI/PACT research team created the following regular
expression:
//?q=[a-z0-9]{8}(-[a-z0-9]{4}){3}-[a-z0-9]{12}&qi=[A-Za-z0-9%]{16}&q1=/

The parameters (“&qi”, “&q1”, “&q2”, “&q3” and “s6rt”) seen in the URL of the Shark HTTP
requests have been hardcoded in all observed Shark backdoors.
Milan:
Milan is a 32-bit RAT written in Visual C++ and .NET. Milan is loaded and persists using
tasks. An encoded routine waits for three to four seconds between executing the first task,
deleting this task, and setting a second scheduled task for persistence.
8/13

Some of the Milan backdoors analyzed by ACTI also include samples that were clustered as
DanBot backdoors in ClearSky’s report. However, these samples are all written in Visual C++
and .NET, while DanBot samples are written in C# and .NET. Although there are certain
differences among the Milan samples, ACTI has conducted sample comparisons indicating a
high similarity across this cluster of Milan samples. The image below depicts five Milan
samples in which the strings in each sample has a greater than 86% code similarity rate with
the other backdoors.

Image 3: Sample Similarity Coverings Functions and strings among Milan Samples
Like Shark, Milan queries the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftCryptography MachineGuid to retrieve the
GUID for the victim machine, from which both backdoors use the last eight characters to
generate a unique identifier for the victim machine.
Like Shark, Milan is also able to use both DNS and HTTP(S) for C2 communications. For C2
communications over DNS, Milan uses hardcoded domains as the input for a custom (DGA).
The DGA is documented in Kaspersky’s report as is some of the syntax used by Milan for C2
over HTTP(S).
However, ACTI found that some of the legacy Milan backdoors retrieve data by generating
requests using the hard-coded domain and then requesting one of a number Active Server
Page-related URL paths. These URL paths are hardcoded within some of the Milan samples.
Those identified by ACTI were:
contact.aspx
default.aspx
preview.aspx
team.aspx
ACTI/PACT Investigation:

9/13

ACTI started seeing the Shark campaign in host-based telemetry on July 19, 2021, when
various hosts in Israel started executing a Shark backdoor with the following attributes:
Filename: “Shark.exe”
SHA-256: 2f2ef9e3f6db2146bd277d3c4e94c002ecaf7deaabafe6195fddabc81a8ee76c

ACTI observed this file being executed on a large number of hosts in Israel. Many of these
machines carried Windows 10 Enterprise and Pro builds, while other observed operating
systems within victim environments were older Windows Server 2016 Datacenter and
Windows Server 2019 Datacenter builds. It is possible that some of the machines executing
Shark.exe were part of an incident response effort – against the Lyceum campaigns – as
they appear to have operating systems within (likely multiple individual) virtual machines that
appear to have been created for single executions of the Shark backdoor on a variety of
Windows operating systems. The referenced file (Shark.exe) was first submitted to a thirdparty malware repository on August 2, 2021 from a submitter who appears to be based in
Israel. On September 27, 2021, the same third-party malware repository submitter also
uploaded a file with the following attributes:
Filename: “data.dat”
SHA-256: 17ab5ee10033da8a519c0547581f40677b973345d8c3172a4fde612692188460

This file is not malicious but contains the output from DNS requests generated by the DGA
and the hardcoded C2 domain in the previously referenced Shark.exe file.

Image 4: Shark Generated Subdomains Found in File Uploaded from Israel
Seen in totality, the host-based Shark executions coupled with Shark backdoor and telemetry
submissions from Israel, indicated to the ACTI/PACT research team that victimology would
likely include Lyceum victims in Israel. The research team overlaid the Shark malware syntax
on the Prevailion’s C2 telemetry, which at the time of analysis consisted of data from 14
assessed Lyceum C2 domains. This was initially done to detect DGA-generated DNS
requests and subsequently the previously described HTTP patterns. The effort focusing on

10/13

Shark-generated DNS requests only yielded what is assessed to be sandbox runs of Shark
samples, egressing from various IP-address infrastructure owned by security or cloud
vendors.
However, when the ACTI/PACT research team queried the Prevailion dataset based on the
previously referenced regular expression, consistent beaconing was observed through
September and continuing into October 2021 from a number of IP addresses resolving to
telecommunication companies and ISPs in Israel and Saudi Arabia. The inclusion of the
parameter: “s6rt” (see red box in image below) indicate backdoors where traffic was set for
beaconing.

Image 5: Prevailion Telemetry Indicating Backdoor Activity Egressing from Shark Backdoor
Victims
The Shark backdoors were likely in beacon mode due to Lyceum operators having lost
control of the backdoor following Prevailion’s assumption of control of the Shark C2 domains:
“defenderstatus[.]com” and “zonestatistic[.]com”
Queries for a DGA generated by the Milan backdoor yielded the same kind of telemetry as
seen for the Shark DGA-generated DNS requests. As with Shark, most of them were short
duration beacons egressing from cloud or IP spaces related to security vendors. The lack of
use of the DGA DNS tunneling in the observed Lyceum C2 telemetry could indicate that the
DNS tunnelling is only used during the first phase of the compromise, but then retired in
preference of HTTP(S) as Lyceum becomes well established in the victim network.
When the ACTI/PACT team queried the Prevailion dataset for the previously referenced
known hardcoded URL paths contact.aspx, Default.aspx, preview.aspx, and team.aspx
observed in Milan samples, the researchers observed continued beaconing from an IP
address that resolved to a telecommunications operator in Morocco.

11/13

Image 6: Prevailion Telemetry Indicating Backdoor Activity Egressing from MilanRAT
Backdoor Victims
It is unknown if the Milan backdoor beacons are coming from a customer of the Moroccan
telecommunication operator or from internal systems within the operator. However, since
Lyceum has historically targeted telecommunication providers and the Kaspersky team
identified recent targeting of telecommunication operators in Tunisia, it would follow that
Lyceum is targeting other north African telecommunication companies. The ACTI/PACT
research team therefore assess that the observed Milan activity is likely emanating directly
from within the Moroccan telecommunications operator.
During late October 2021 the ACTI/PACT team identified beaconing from a reconfigured or
possibly a new Lyceum backdoor. The observed beacons looked like the following:

Image 7: Observed Beaconing from a Reconfigured or New Lyceum Backdoor
The observed beacons were seen egressing from a telecommunications company in Tunisia
as well as an MFA in Africa. The URL syntax of the newly reconfigured backdoor are
somewhat similar to those generated in the newer version of Milan.

https://securednsservice[.]net/?
proto=6&index=MjJkYzEwZWY5NTY5NDk3ZDg2YTljNDYzNWQxYTc0YTM%3D&name=

12/13

The URL syntax is configurable within the Milan backdoor and ACTI/PACT assesses it as
likely that the Lyceum operators reconfigured the URL syntax used by Milan to circumvent
IDS or IPS that were encoded to detect previous the Milan beacon syntax. The new
backdoor syntax is matched by the following regular expression:
//?(proto|kind|pt)=[0-9]{1}&(index|pi|serv)=/

However, as it is configurable it may only be useful to create ad-hoc network detection rules.
