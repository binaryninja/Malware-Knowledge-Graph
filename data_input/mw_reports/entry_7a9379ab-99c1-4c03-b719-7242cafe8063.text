Excel Add-ins Deliver JSSLoader Malware

The GOLD NIAGARA threat group has expanded its tactics for delivering the JSSLoader RAT,
spoofing legitimate Microsoft Excel add-ins to infect systems. Tuesday, March 8, 2022 By: Counter
Threat Unit Research Team
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed multiple malicious Microsoft
Excel add-ins delivering JSSLoader malware. JSSLoader is a remote access trojan (RAT) that was
first observed in 2019 and is used by the GOLD NIAGARA cybercrime group. An Excel add-in

extends Excel functionality, typically uses the '.xll' file extension, and functions similar to a dynamic
link library (DLL). These observations indicate a change to tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs), as the threat actors previously leveraged malicious executable files or Excel macros.
The original delivery mechanism was unavailable for analysis, but the add-ins were reportedly
delivered via invoice-themed emails. This approach is consistent with previous GOLD NIAGARA
activity. The XLL files analyzed by CTU™ researchers use the ExcelDna.xll filename, possibly to
mimic a legitimate Excel add-in project of the same name. Executing the XLL file launches Excel and
displays a security warning (see Figure 1). If the user enables the add-in, its code executes within
the context of the Excel process, attempts to download a JSSLoader binary to the %TEMP%
directory, and then executes the binary.

The JSSLoader RAT can harvest data about the compromised system and send it to a command and
control (C2) server (see Figure 2), run commands, download additional malicious payloads, and
execute files.

The malware authors have made several changes over the years, including briefly shifting to C++
code in mid-2021. In late 2021, JSSLoader samples written in the original .NET language
reemerged. Samples observed in 2022 continue to use .NET and include only minor differences from
late 2021 samples. The .NET code lacks robust obfuscation, instead relying on variable .NET class
and function names, simplistic encoding and decoding functions, a large number of unused strings,
and string splitting/concatenation to avoid reliable detection (see Figure 3).

Once executed, JSSLoader collects basic system information, sends the information to the C2
server, and then waits for commands. The malware uses Windows shortcut (.lnk) files for
persistence.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use available
controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. The URL and domains
may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.
