The academic and education industry is large and complex. It comprises a diverse range of
institutions, from elementary schools through to research organizations, and spans both the
public and private sectors. The industry has two critically important roles. The first is
providing education as a service, and in this role, the sector needs to be vigilant in the face
of the ever-growing threat of eCrime. The second is in driving research and development,
and the cultivation of new ideas — and in this role, the education industry has the potential to
shape national economies and policy priorities, and ultimately support the power of the state.
This positions the academic industry as a priority target for state-sponsored — and to a
lesser extent, hacktivist — threat actors.
The primary motivations for threat adversaries to target each of the sub-sectors of academia
are outlined in the table below.

Motivations

Espionage. Academic
institutions hold valuable
intellectual property, making
them a target for nation-state
espionage operations supporting
national research and
development
objectives. Academic institutions
also play a pivotal role in policy
development, and count many
influential people among their
staff and alumni. This makes
them valuable sources
for intelligence collection
objectives.
Network Access. Nation-state
adversaries have leveraged
compromised academic networks
for operational infrastructure, and
for gaining additional access to
associated parties and networks,
due to the culture of open
connectivity often observed
within academic environments.

Financial. The
academic attack
surface is broad
and complex, due
to the nature of its
users and
operations.
Criminals exploit
the sector’s
reliance on
information
systems, using
ransomware and
data extortion to
extract payments.

Ideology.
Hacktivists may
conduct
Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS)
campaigns, data
leaks, or web
defacements, or
may compromise
social media
accounts to
disrupt academic
services and/or
publicly
embarrass an
entity.

What Did the Threat to Academia Look Like in 2020?
2/7

Activity observed by CrowdStrike throughout 2020 reinforces that the academic industry
faces a serious and present threat from criminal and nation-state adversaries. Falcon
OverWatch™ observed a more than fourfold increase in intrusions against the academic and
education industries compared to 2019. This increase is driven in large part by eCrime
activity, which has accounted for 82% of activity uncovered by Falcon OverWatch in the
education and academic industries this year.
Since mid-August 2020, there has been a notable increase in adversaries targeting
academia, primarily pursuing big game hunting (BGH) operations against these institutions.
BGH adversaries are deploying enterprise-wide ransomware, using both data encryption and
extortion to coerce victims into paying large ransoms. A similar period of ransomware activity
targeting academic entities was witnessed a year earlier in September 2019. The timing of
the new operations coincided with the start of the new academic year for many education
institutions in the U.S. and U.K. This year, the threat of disruptions looms larger, as the
COVID-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to move lessons online. With eLearning
becoming the new normal, disruptions could have a significant impact on the ability to
provide learning, making the opportunity that much more tantalizing for eCrime adversaries.
Through 2020, both CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch also observed nationstate activity targeting schools and universities. Nation-state actors are often highly skilled,
well-resourced and have the luxury of time to conduct exhaustive reconnaissance against
their intended victims. This allows the adversary to collect sensitive information about their
victim to help craft more genuine social engineering campaigns with a greater chance of
eliciting a victim response.
A particularly pertinent example of nation-state activity against the academic industry has
been the ongoing targeting of universities and research institutions involved in COVID-19
research. Since April 2020, intrusion activity targeting coronavirus research has been
reported against U.S., U.K, Spanish, South Korean, Japanese and Australian laboratories;
this activity was conducted on the part of Russian, Iranian, Chinese and North Korean
actors.
In one such example from the second half of 2020, Falcon OverWatch uncovered a targeted
intrusion against an academic institution known to be involved in the development of COVID19 testing capabilities. The malicious activity in question was attributed to a China-nexus
actor, which gained initial access by way of a successful SQL injection attack against a
vulnerable web server. Once inside the victim environment, the actor compiled and launched
a web shell that was used to perform various malicious activities largely focused on
information gathering and collection. Notably, the actor’s activities included the enumeration
of a particular directory housing health-related files and data, suggesting the actor likely
knew what they were looking for. With the extensive research and development that
continues to surround the COVID-19 pandemic, Falcon OverWatch continues to observe
state-sponsored actors displaying a keen interest in academic institutions.

Interestingly, even when academia is not the ultimate target for nation-state actors, it can still
be a valuable intermediate target to support broader intelligence objectives — including
political, national security and economic espionage. For reasons explored next, nation-state
adversaries may view the academic sector as a soft target for initial access for future
operations against other associated sectors.
Although large-scale hacktivism efforts have decreased over the past couple of years,
hacktivist groups are assessed to present a low to moderate threat to the academic sector. A
historic look at hacktivism targeting academia suggests these actors are opportunistically
and intermittently targeting educational institutions in line with certain nationalist and
ideological dogmas.

The Who’s Who of the Academia Threat Landscape
As of this writing, CrowdStrike is tracking 150 threat actors across nation-state, eCrime and
hacktivist motivations, 40 of which have a history of attacking academic institutions.
25 of these adversaries are nation-state threat actors
11 are sophisticated criminal syndicates
4 are hacktivists
Criminal activity accounts for the vast majority of intrusion activity, with groups such as
DOPPEL SPIDER, RIDDLE SPIDER, CIRCUS SPIDER, TWISTED SPIDER, PINCHY
SPIDER, WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER being most active. Criminal activity across
the globe is up 330% in 2020 compared to 2019, while nation-state attacks remain steady.
Adversaries such as VELVET CHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, BERSERK BEAR,
STATIC KITTEN, WICKED PANDA and KRYPTONITE PANDA account for multiple
operations throughout the year.

What Are the Risks for the Academic Industry?
1. The Tyranny of Many Endpoints
Many academic institutions have a wide attack surface relative to other organizations. In the
early days of the internet, academic-sector networks were specifically designed to foster
collaboration between globally separated research teams. This focus on accessibility means
that many organizations still feature “bring your own device” (BYOD) policies to cater to
students and independently operated enclaves. An example of this could be a research lab
maintaining their own servers outside the administration of an IT department for the sake of
sensitive analysis. BYOD setups have also been a key feature of eLearning for schools and
universities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

4/7

Defenders should be aware that Falcon OverWatch regularly observes adversaries
leveraging malware-free or fileless techniques. Accordingly, academic institutions are in the
precarious position of having to defend against ever-increasing threats deliberately hidden
amongst the benign. State-sponsored and criminal actors continue to live off the land, using
compromised credentials in conjunction with trusted utilities often natively available on the
host operating system to conduct their actions on objectives. A deterioration in basic security
hygiene practices including unpatched external resources and exposed services is often the
catalyst for actors gaining initial access, and in many cases a malicious payload or the
absence of obvious malware proves challenging for those institutions reliant on traditional AV
or technology-based controls. The continued proliferation of malicious activity that blends in
as legitimate administrative behavior warrants institutions to adopt a mix of technology and
human-led hunting services to counter the ever-increasing threat.

2. Higher-risk Users Present Challenges
Academic institutions are more likely than organizations in any other industry to have a broad
cross-section of users accessing their networks. With staff and students accessing academic
networks, there is a wide range of ages, skills levels and online behavior to contend with.
Further, rolling out regular security awareness training, and ensuring compliance across such
a wide user base, is uniquely challenging. Adversaries are well aware that users can be the
weak point in an academic institution’s defenses, making them an attractive target for both
criminal and state-sponsored intrusions.

3. Dispersed Networks Constrain Effective Oversight
Due to nature in which academic institutions share information, there is a general culture of
open connectivity with few security controls deployed at these interconnection points. The
academic sector operates as a nexus of information and access for numerous additional
sectors, creating a tantalizing prospect for threat adversaries. If a compromise occurs, it may
cause ripple effects across multiple other verticals within a targeted region or country.
After finding their way into academic networks, actors turn their attention to discovery, often
conducting extensive reconnaissance to identify additional resources within their reach. It is
also common to see adversaries leveraging collections of compromised credentials in
conjunction with RDP, various native and readily available file retrieval and transfer utilities,
and network shares to move laterally between hosts in search of valuable information to
support their objectives.
The aforementioned credentials are also combined with the use of various common
command-line remote access tools including SSH and telnet to establish persistent access.
In recent activity, Falcon OverWatch has also noted the use of alternate methods for
preserving remote access such as the deployment and subsequent use of VPN clients, as
well as legitimate remote administration utilities.

4. Widely Available Open Source Information Feeds Social Engineering
Campaigns
Students, research fellows and professors eager to share their own research may also have
their own websites outside of university networks. Although they may not be directly linked
with the university, the association still exists. Often, these sites are mined for details
supporting threat actor reconnaissance, later used for social engineering and phishing
campaigns.

Recommendations
Although these threat adversaries are often highly sophisticated and can leverage complex
tooling in their operations, defending against these attacks is not a lost cause. There are
many security and intelligence solutions available to assist organizations in better
understanding the threat adversaries, their TTPs and the tradecraft they regularly employ. In
many cases, it is more important to have visibility as opposed to assuming security
technologies alone will be capable of preventing attacks. Here is a list of some high-level
recommendations:
Sensor Coverage. You can’t stop what you don’t see. Organizations should deploy
capabilities that provide their defenders with full visibility across their environment, to
avoid blind spots that can become a safe haven for adversaries.
Technical Intelligence. Leverage technical intelligence, such as indicators of
compromise (IOCs), and consume them into a security information and event manager
(SIEM) for data enrichment purposes. This allows for added intelligence when
conducting event correlation, potentially highlighting events on the network that may
have otherwise gone undetected. Implementing high-fidelity IOCs across multiple
security technologies increases much-needed situational awareness.
Threat Intelligence. Consuming narrative threat intelligence reports is a sure-fire
method for painting a very vivid picture of threat actor behavior, the tools they leverage
and the tradecraft they employ. Threat intelligence assists with threat actor profiling,
campaign tracking and malware family tracking. These days, it is more important to
understand the context of an attack rather than just knowing an attack itself happened,
and this is where threat intelligence plays a vital role.
Threat Hunting. Understanding technology will only get organizations so far is more
important now than ever before. Security technologies are not 100%, and
understanding technology is not infallible is the first step in coming to grips with the
need for 24/7, managed, human-based threat hunting.
Service Provider. Partnering with a best-of-breed service provider is a necessity.
Should the unthinkable happen, organizations may require assistance responding to
sophisticated threats.

6/7

Adopting even just one of these recommendations will go a long way in assisting
organizations in strengthening the security strategy. The combination of all — or at least
many — of these recommendations greatly enhances an organization’s ability to defend and
detect these threats with the goal of stopping a breach from occurring.

Conclusion
Due to the current environment, specifically as it relates to COVID-19, there is no
expectation of threat activity slowing down in the nearterm. COVID-19 has introduced
additional complexity into academia with remote schooling. The various vaccine research
and development projects underway at academic institutions across the globe also make for
attractive targeting. Criminals will continue to leverage ransomware as a means to disrupt
academic networks, pressuring schools and universities into paying in order to restore
operations as soon as possible. Additionally, nation-state actors will continue to target
academia as a means of supplementing various intelligence-collection objectives primarily
centered around political and economic espionage.
