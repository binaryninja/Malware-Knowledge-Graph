With the BlackMatter ransomware operation shutting down, existing affiliates are moving
their victims to the competing LockBit ransomware site for continued extortion.
This morning, news broke that the BlackMatter ransomware gang is shutting down after
members have gone missing and increased pressure by law enforcement.
As part of this shutdown, the ransomware operators are allowing affiliates to receive
decryptors for existing negotiations so that they can continue extorting victims.
While BlackMatter's infrastructure is still live, BleepingCompuer has learned that affiliates
are moving existing victims to the LockBit ransomware negotiation site.

Tor sites where new negotiation pages have been setup for them.

victims to receive a ransom payment.
As for BlackMatter, they are continuing their shut down, with today's activities being to

With REvil and BlackMatter now shut down, LockBit has become one of the largest and
most successful ransomware operations running today.
The LockBit representative known as 'LockbitSupp' has shown to be a savvy threat actor
who constantly adjusts tactics to recruit new affiliates, especially as established operations
shut down.
While BlackMatter will likely rebrand and return as a new ransomware operation, their
partnership with LockBit may hurt them in the long run as they lose experienced affiliates.
