TAGGED: Aveo, FormerFirstRAT, Ido Laboratory, microsoft, snoozetime

Palo Alto Networks has identified a malware family known as ‘Aveo’ that is being used to target
Japanese speaking users. The ‘Aveo’ malware name comes from an embedded debug string
within the binary file. The Aveo malware family has close ties to the previously discussed
FormerFirstRAT malware family, which was also witnessed being used against Japanese
targets. Aveo is disguised as a Microsoft Excel document, and drops a decoy document upon
execution. The decoy document in question is related to a research initiative led by the Ido
Laboratory at the Saitama Institute of Technology. Upon execution, the Aveo malware accepts a
number of commands, allowing attackers to take full control over the victim machine.

The Aveo malware sample disguises itself as a Microsoft Excel document, as the icon below
demonstrates. Note that the filename of ‘malware.exe’ is simply a placeholder, as the original
filename is unknown.

Figure 2 Decoy document used with Aveo malware

This decoy document is hosted on the Ido Laboratory and contains information about a 2016
research initiative. The document lists participants in the 16th CAVE workshop, including
names, affiliations, and email addresses of those involved. The document, written in Japanese,
as well as the filename of this document, “CAVE研究会参加者.xls”, indicates that this malware
was used to target one or more Japanese speaking individuals. Additionally, the similarities
between the Aveo and FormerFirstRAT malware families, which will be discussed later in the
post, further add evidence that Japanese speakers are being targeted.

The Aveo Trojan is configured to communicate with the following domain name over HTTP.
snoozetime[.]info
This domain was first registered in May 2015 to ‘jack.ondo@mail.com’. Since that time, it has
since been associated with the following three IP addresses:
104.202.173[.]82
107.180.36[.]179
50.63.202[.]38
All IP addresses in question are located within the United States.

Figure 3 PassiveTotal screenshot showing associated IP addresses with snoozetime[.]info
The WHOIS information for snoozetime[.]info lists a registrant email address of
‘jack.ondo@mail[.]com’ and a name of ‘aygt5ruhrj aygt5ruhrj gerhjrt’. Pivoting off of these two
pieces of information to domains that share the same yields the following additional domains
and email addresses.

coinpack[.]info
7b7p[.]info
donkeyhaws[.]info
europcubit[.]com
jhmiyh.ny@gmail[.]com
844148030@qq[.]com

After running the self-extracting executable, a number of files are dropped to the file system and
the following execution flow is witnessed:

Figure 4 Malware execution flow
When the mshelp32.exe executable runs, it begins by reading in the setting32.ini file, which
contains the name of the decoy document. This information is used to build a batch script, such
as the following.

del %0 /F /Q

This batch script is executed within a new process, and acts as a simple cleanup script that runs
after Aveo and the decoy document are executed.

The Aveo malware initially runs an install routine, which will copy itself to the following location:
%APPDATA%\MMC\MMC.exe
If for any reason the %APPDATA%\MMC directory is unable to be created, Aveo will use
%TEMP% instead of %APPDATA%.
After the malware copies itself, it will execute MMC.exe in a new process with an argument of
the original filename. When executed, if this single argument is provided, the malware will
delete the file path provided.
After the installation routine completes, Aveo will exfiltrate the following victim information to a
remote server via HTTP.
Unique victim hash
IP Address
Microsoft Windows version
Username
ANSI code page identifier
This information is exfiltrated to the ‘snoozetime[.]info’ domain, as seen in the following example

To encrypt the provided data, the malware makes use of the RC4 algorithm, using a key of
‘hello’. As shown in the following image, the encryption routines between Aveo and
FormerFirstRAT are almost identical, with only the algorithms and keys being changed.

After the initial victim information is exfiltrated, the malware expects a response of ‘OK’.
Afterwards, Aveo will spawn a new thread that is responsible for handling interactive command
requests received by the command and control (C2) server, as well as requests to spawn an
interactive shell.
Aveo proceeds to set the following registry key to point towards the malware’s path, thus
ensuring persistence across reboots:
HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run\msnetbridge
A command handler loop is then entered, where Aveo will accept commands from the remote
C2. While the Aveo malware family awaits a response, it will perform sleep delays of randomly
chosen intervals between 0 and 3276 milliseconds. Should the C2 server respond with ‘toyota’,
it will set that interval to 60 seconds. Aveo accepts the following commands, shown with their
associated function.
1 : Execute command in interactive shell
2 : Get file attributes
3 : Write file
4 : Read file
5 : List drives
6 : Execute DIR command against path
The following example request demonstrates the C2 server sending the ‘ipconfig’ command to
the Aveo malware.

Aveo shares a number of characteristics with FormerFirstRAT, including encryption routines,
code reuse, and similarities in C2 functionality. Aveo is far from the most sophisticated malware
family around. As witnessed in the previously discussed FormerFirstRAT sample, this related
malware family also looks to be targeting Japanese speaking users. Using a self-extracting
WinRAR file, the malware drops a decoy document, a copy of the Aveo malware, and a cleanup
script.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:

An AutoFocus tag has been created to track and monitor this threat
