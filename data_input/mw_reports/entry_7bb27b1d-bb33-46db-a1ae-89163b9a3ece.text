Goblin Panda against the Bears
During my last investigation (here), I’ve found two RTFs malware
documents with the same techniques of exploitation of CVE-2017–
11882:
A le 8.t in %TMP% with Package Ole Object
The same loop of decryption
The same runPE after overwriting in memory EQNEDT32.exe
But the payload is really di erent. It’s not a version of PlugX but a
version of Sis der studied by Ncc group.
https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-andevents/blogs/2018/june/cve-2017-8570-rtf-and-the-sisfader-rat/
With the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same
interactions with operating system than my last article and the paper of
NCC Group.

Behaviour of malwares

The di erence with the version studied by NCC Group is the Package
Ole Object. In the article of NCC Group, the researchers talk about a
SCT File and many javascript manipulations for dropping the RAT on
the disk and to start it.

Here, the payload is encrypted in 8.t le
If we analyze EQNEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, we
have the same technics anti emulation with the same value.
In a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah.

Anti emulation tricks

Anti emulation tricks

The veri cation is calling GetMessage() and the value is stored in EAX
in the function sub_401A60.

The comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0.

Juste after we found again the loop of decryption for the con g.

Loop of decrypting con g

It’s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key.
The mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just
after dropping di erents les and a privilege escalation.

We found the same name of the dll les.

Persistence and loading agent

The malware overwrite the comobject
{9BA05972-F6A8–11CF-A442–00A0C90A8F39} to execute when this
com object is called to make a persistence

ComObject Adding

All evidences show is the same payload Sisfader RAT.
Threat Intel
The toolset for exploiting the module of equation is the same using of
the compromission for Vietnameses O cials used by Goblin Panda.
(APT 1937CN)

If we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is
kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a real good pivot. It makes the link with
Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT.
And the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on
three IPs:
122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200
Theses addresses can permit to found others domains:
Sd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new
IP 1.188.233.201

Infrastructure

The Ip Address 103.255.45.200 has two domains:
www.36106g.com
36106g.com

Infrastructure

All infrastructure is based at Shanghai.
The victims are di erent than the Vietnameses campaign.
They targeted Telecom Firms pretending to be the Intelligence Service
of Russia (FSB)

RTFs content

So Gobelin Panda targets like the report of CrowdStrike
https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ266/images/ReportGlobalThreatIntelligence.pdf he telecom industries
in Russia.

Conclusion
Goblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian
with the same exploitation techniques for Vietnameses O cials. They
updated theirs technics than the report of NCC group.
