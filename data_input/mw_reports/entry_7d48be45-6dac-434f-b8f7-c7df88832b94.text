May 29, 2020

Some of the most notorious actors in the cyber threat landscape have been traced back to
sponsorship by the Russian state. As the digital revolution has accelerated, so, too, has the
Russian cyber attack landscape — hold-over Cold War tactics that evolved to take advantage of
new electronic methods of communication.
Strategic Russian interests are guided by the desires for Russia to be recognized as a great
power, to protect the Russian identity, and to limit global United States power. These themes are
evident in components commonly associated with Russian-backed cyber threat campaigns:
The weaponization of information through disinformation campaigns and propaganda
Attempted interference in democratic processes
Strategic positioning within critical infrastructure, perhaps as preparation for potential
escalation of hostilities with rival nations.
To summarize the threat at a more tactical level, we have scoured cybersecurity reporting in order
to prepare an overview of cyber threat actors observed more recently, and to which evidencebased analysis has assigned the likelihood of Russian state-sponsorship as probable. Each actor
is presented with highlights of more notable campaign activity, with notations on countries and
sectors targeted, as well as a mention of behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
utilized in order to enable actions on objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed,

Russian Cyber Attack Campaigns and Actors - Threat Research

Who are today’s major Russian adversary groups and what are the main tactics and techniques
of Russian cyber attack campaigns? Let’s take a closer look at some of these known actors, listed
here in order of threat scope and potential:

Sandworm Team
Active since at least 2009, the Sandworm Team is responsible for the ﬁrst publicly acknowledged
cyber incident that resulted in power outages impacting a civilian population, occurring in Ukraine
in December 2015. The malware used in this attack, BlackEnergy 3, enabled the actor to gain
access to the IT network of a Ukrainian power company, from which they pivoted to the SCADA
portion of the network, giving the actor the ability to manipulate the Industrial Control System
(ICS) — without the need for customized malware — in order to shut down power in Kiev. This is
an often mis-characterized component of the campaign, likely because the BlackEnergy 2
predecessor to BlackEnergy 3 contained ICS targeting components that are not present in
BlackEnergy 3. Cybersecurity researchers also note that “Russian operators, such as Sandworm
Team, have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption,”
perhaps in order to stage for future potential Russian cyber attack campaigns.

Known
Targets

NATO member countries, Ukraine, Telecommunications, Energy, Gov‐
ernment, Education

Sample
TTPs

Spearphishing utilizing weaponized Microsoft Ofﬁce documents
Denial of Service attacks for the purposes of disrupting
communications
Remotely controlling SCADA
Destruction of ﬁles by utilizing KillDisk malware

Also Known
As

BlackEnergy, Voodoo Bear, TEMP.Noble, Iron Viking

ELECTRUM
This group is responsible for the CRASHOVERRIDE malware framework (frequently also referred
to as Industroyer), which was the ﬁrst malware to ever speciﬁcally target and disrupt electric grid
operations. In December 2016, Russian cyber attack by these actors manipulated breakers at a
substation in Kiev Ukraine, leading to power disruption and serious damage to equipment.
ELECTRUM has links to Sandworm as their development group, but it appears that the
understanding of which team actually carried out the attack has evolved over time. Regardless of
the speciﬁc threat actor, the behaviors demonstrated are what are important to understand.

As

Maliciously impacting operations by leveraging ICS protocols
Establishment of an internal proxy within a compromised network which
receives connections from backdoors installed on other systems within
the network, and attempts to funnel data to external command and con‐
trol servers
Incorporation of malware modules with data wiping capabilities
Sandworm Team

Telebots
Telebots is the group attributed to the NotPetya ransomware outbreak, which is the most
destructive attack in history from a ﬁnancial perspective, and is reported to be an evolution of the
group or groups responsible for causing the Ukrainian blackouts described in the previous two
sections. In 2018, the security ﬁrm ESET identiﬁed code linkages between NotPetya and
CRASHOVERRIDE (which they refer to as the Industroyer attack). The NotPetya attack initially
targeted industries in Ukraine after the threat actor was able to effect a supply-chain compromise
of Ukrainian accounting software. The incorporation of the EternalBlue exploit for SMB in
conjunction with the password dumping tool Mimikatz enabled NotPetya to cripple networks
around the globe.

Sandworm Team

Energetic Bear
This group is assessed as the creator of the Havex RAT, which is one of ﬁve known ICS tailored
malware families. Energetic Bear campaigns began in 2010 in order to collect intelligence used
for espionage (as opposed to attempting destruction or disruption of systems) and have continued
through at least 2017. The TTPs leveraged by this threat actor are not unique or particularly
novel, but the systematic and deliberate social engineering strategies employed are. Smaller, less

DYMALLOY
Some researchers attribute the activities of this group to an evolution of Energetic Bear activity
(referring to earlier activity as Dragonﬂy and later activity as Dragonﬂy 2.0); however, Dragos
asserts that there are enough technical differences to justify tracking this as a separate group.
This group avoids using custom malware, opting for commodity malware families that hinder
attempts at applying attribution. Crowdstrike reports that this group has strong ties to Moscow, as
targeting aligns closely with likely collection priorities of Russian intelligence.

Known Targets

Industrial Control Systems in Turkey, Europe, and the United States

Sample TTPs

Use of commodity malware such as Goodor, DorShel, and Karagany

Also Known
As

Dragonﬂy 2.0, Berserk Bear

APT29
This group has operated since at least 2008, collecting intelligence in support of foreign and
security policy decision-making. The primary targets are Western governments and related
organizations, but intrusion attempts have been witnessed across a broad spectrum of sectors.
Notable compromises include the intrusion into the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and
2016, and intrusions into unclassiﬁed networks of a variety of U.S. government departments.

APT28
This espionage-focused group has also operated since at least the mid 2000s, targeting multiple
sectors around the world with special focus on defensive sector organizations. Multiple
governments have attributed the actions of this group to Russian military intelligence service, and
notable operations have targeted organizations such as the International Olympic Committee, the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Democratic National Committee
(similar to APT29). Cybersecurity researchers identify this actor as conducting some of the most
far-reaching and sophisticated Russian cyber attack campaigns to date.

In May 2019, the hacking collective Fxmsp gained notoriety for reported breaches of three major
antivirus companies.This group targeted intellectual property from each company, including code
base, development documentation, and information on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) modeling for the
purposes of offering up this information for sale, as well as selling network access to victims.

WIZARD SPIDER
This cyber criminal group targets large organizations by deploying Ryuk ransomware via Trickbot
banking malware. Evidence suggests that the ransom demand varies depending on the size of
the targeted organization, and, as of January 2019, the total amount collected by the group was
$3.7 million USD. At the end of 2019, researchers identiﬁed that WIZARD SPIDER continues to
add functionality to the Ryuk variants it delivers in order to maximize the number of systems
within a network impacted by ﬁle encryption.

Turla
Researchers have linked activity from this threat group to Moonlight Maze, a massive data breach
of U.S. government classiﬁed information in the late 1990s, and one of the ﬁrst widely known
cyber espionage campaigns in history. Another notable campaign took place in 2008, when
Agent.btz malware infected U.S. government classiﬁed networks via infected removable media.
This group is still in active operation today. More recent operations of this Russian cyber attack
campaign and group have been extremely targeted, going through extensive lengths to ﬁngerprint

systems, collecting as much information as possible, before making a determination as to
whether the target is of interest for further operations. One of the techniques utilized includes
attempting to lure visitors of compromised websites to download fake Adobe Flash updates, an
approach utilized by cyber criminals across the globe.

XENOTIME
This group has been identiﬁed as the most dangerous threat actor publicly known, due to its
association with malware known as TRITON, designed to target a speciﬁc safety instrumented
system (SIS) within industrial control systems. SIS are hardware and software controls used to
implement safe states in order to avoid adverse safety, health, and environmental consequences,
and, as such, targeting of these systems could lead to loss of life scenarios. TRITON was
discovered at a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia when the attacker was believed to have
inadvertently shut down plant operations after gaining access to a SIS engineering workstation to
deploy the attack framework. Because TRITON malware samples are now easily discoverable
online, the bar has effectively been lowered for other threat actors to enter the ICS arena.

FIN7
The operations of this ﬁnancially motivated threat group have continued well into 2020, despite
the U.S. Department of Justice announcing arrests in August 2018 of individuals with ties to the
group. This group is known for leveraging Carbanak malware in addition to other tools, in order to
enable the theft of more than 15 million customer credit card records from victims spanning
hundreds of companies in the United States and abroad. FIN7 operators have engaged in
sophisticated social engineering techniques, including actively engaging targets in back and forth
dialogue before sending malicious documents leading to malware implants.
