There were over 60,000 emails in Michał Dworczyk’s hacked mailbox. We have new
evidence that UNC1151, a group related to the Belarusian government and serving a
“Ghostwriter” operation in Russia’s interest, is behind the attack.
FRONTSTORY.PL has reasons to believe that attackers may still have a vast amount of
sensitive data from VIPs’ emails up their sleeves.
This article was originally published in Polish on FRONTSTORY.PL
Since June 2021, all of Poland has been reading the contents of Michał Dworczyk’s mailbox,
right-hand man of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The Polish government consistently
plays down the importance of the breach, even though it exposed poor defense against
cyber-attacks, and negligence on the part of politicians when it comes to sharing sensitive
data. Dworczyk’s emails uncover the backstage of Mateusz Morawiecki’s administration –
strategic decisions made with PR in mind, government media treated as useful tools,
defamatory campaigns aimed against specific groups.

Key to Dworczyk’s mailbox

We covered the multi-layered operation called “Ghostwriter”, with trails leading to Belarus
and Russia, almost a year ago on vsquare.org and tvn24.pl. Since then, we have been
investigating its consecutive phases, trying to establish what goes on behind the scenes.
In one of the recent publications, we described how one of the phishing emails sent by
attackers opened the door to Dworczyk’s mailbox. Phishing is a form of fraud – a criminal
pretends to be somebody else or an entity (i.e. email service provider), in order to trick the
recipient and obtain credentials.
After publishing that story, we asked Marcin Siedlarz, an expert from Mandiant, an
international company specializing in cyber-security, for additional analysis of data from a
phishing email.
His conclusions? – The message was sent from an IP address used previously in other
confirmed attacks by the UNC1151 group. This attribution is made with high confidence –
assesses Siedlarz.
And what that means? We can assume with high probability, the attack on Dworczyk’s
mailbox was carried out by Belarusian hackers, who also serve a multi-layered cyberespionage operation called “Ghostwriter”. In cyber-security terminology “attribution” means
accrediting a specific hacker group with a particular cyber attack.
Mandiant is one of the biggest companies assessing cyber-threats. In November 2021
report, its analysts revealed that members of hacker group UNC1151, who are responsible
for attacks on people and institutions in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany,
and provide technical support for the “Ghostwriter” campaign, operate from Minsk, Belarus.
“UNC1151 provides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign,
and is linked to the Belarusian government,” stated the report. According to analysts,
“Belarus is also likely at least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign.” The
experts didn’t rule out Russian contribution to the attacks, or its influence.
Now, we have also a confirmed link between the so-called Dworczyk Leaks and UNC1151
activities.
So what links “Ghostwriter” operation and disinformation attacks consistent with Kremlin
agenda, with activities of a hacker group that is directly tied to Belarusian special services?
There are few possible answers. It is likely that UNC1151 is one of the groups providing
technical support for a multi-layered Russian operation. Even more so, since UNC1151
seems to emulate the GRU patterns, as we reported in August 2021. They gather
information that might benefit different autonomous operations: the “Ghostwriter” campaign,
official Belarusian propaganda, but also reconnaissance and intelligence operations, and
even blackmail. Given Russia’s war in Ukraine, it is also likely that UNC1151 works closely
with Russian hacker groups, and is responsible for getting access to designated targets.

The scale of the operation conducted simultaneously in different countries, its geopolitical
goals, and content distribution in the Russian-speaking social media might go way beyond
the capabilities of Belarusian services. Russian involvement was also investigated by
German intelligence. Series of phishing attacks aimed at Bundestag members were linked to
the “Ghostwriter” operation and were attributed to GRU. At the end of October 2021, the
Council of the European Union condemned Russia for the “Ghostwriter” campaign.

Hack&Leak Operation
When on 24 February Russia invades Ukraine, the website Poufna Rozmowa (“Confidential
Conversation”), which has been posting Michał Dworczyk’s emails for the past nine months,
doesn’t notice it. It continues its work as usual, publishing new screens with emails that
reveal how PiS (Law and Justice) politicians and people close to Prime Minister Morawiecki
do their business.
One week after the attack, a disinformation campaign focused on refugees starts. Suspicious
local Facebook groups circulate false content against people of colour and non-Ukrainian
refugees who cross the Polish-Ukrainian border. When Poufna Rozmowa posts a text that
says: “If those savages cross into Poland, days of PiS are numbered,” its connotations are
obvious. In fact, it is a screen of an email from 2016, extracted from, most likely, hacked
mailbox belonging to Joachim Brudziński, a politician and PiS member. Someone forwarded
him at that time a group email titled: “Voices of Poles/protecting border with Ukraine.”
Three days later Poufna posts the Ukrainian flag with words: “Solidarity with Ukraine.”
Breach into Dworczyk’s mailbox is a special case of Hack&Leak operation (we wrote about
the most famous Hack&Leak operations – an attack on John Podesta, former chairman of
Hilary Clinton’s campaign, and attack on Emmanuel Macron – in August). It is special,
because screens with emails belonging to the Chief of Chancellery, with attached photos and
titles, are being dosed and spoon-fed to general public almost daily for the last nine months.
From June 2021, the contents of Dworczyk’s mailbox were distributed through a Telegram
channel. But it was blocked for Polish viewers in July. Few days later, on 27 July, after
experimenting with other platforms (i.e. Yandex.com chat and profile on Russian social
network vk.com), website Poufna Rozmowa was registered and immediately launched (the
next day another website publishing military materials and documents in Russian was also
launched).
We don’t know who registered both websites – trail stops with a service anonymizing owners’
names, in Iceland.
New Telegram channel promoting Poufna Rozmowa website has been online since August
2021. Original chat created by channel authors has 1500 members – mostly anti-vaxxer
accounts.

Website posts during work hours
Our analysis shows that Poufna Rozmowa usually posts new materials from Monday to
Friday during working time (6 AM to 4 PM CET). Usually, it is two screens per day. Between
July 2021 and February 2022, website posted a total number of 366 entries. Monthly, it is
viewed by 240,000 users (this number has been dropping in last weeks). Most traffic is made
through browsers or search engines – the heaviest traffic is generated by people typing the
address directly or searching words “poufna rozmowa” (“confidential conversation”), and
“maile Dworczyka” “Dworczyk’s emails”).
We have found out that attackers, who hacked Dworczyk’s mailbox, might have gained
access to a vast amount of materials. Dworczyk was using it for over 20 years, including
periods when he served as Deputy Minister of National Defence (2017), and Chief of
Chancellery. At the time of the breach, his mailbox included over 60,000 emails.
We can’t rule out the possibility that Dworczyk’s mailbox has been used by attackers as a
“mother box” – a database containing private addresses of people with whom Dworczyk
exchanged emails. And as such, it could serve as a reference for future phishing attacks.
We still don’t know at what phase the whole operation is right now. According to our unofficial
findings, screens of emails leaked from the Chief of Chancellery’s mailbox published so far
are genuine. But the content of a few attached files that were published initially on the
Telegram channel has been modified. We have reported such manipulations in our previous
articles.
Leaking some genuine material doesn’t mean that all screens will stay genuine in the future.
The strategy called “tainted leaks” has been described by John Railton from CitizenLab (who
also investigates the Pegasus scandal). Once the attackers gain public trust, they can use
such credibility to publish complete false content. This threat seems even bigger now, amid
Russia’s war in Ukraine.

One hundred accounts of people in power
In August 2021, shortly after the scandal broke, we reported some evidence points to
“Dworczyk Leaks” being a part of bigger operation:
Dworczyk’s email address and address of his wife (both created in wp.pl domain) were
targets of phishing attacks carried out between 2020-21. Attackers hacked Facebook
account belonging to Dworczyk’s wife and posted a fabricated message with a link to
the Telegram channel informing about the leak. This post started “the hack-and-leak
scandal.”

content distribution in social media – creators of the Russian-speaking Telegram
channel might have access to Dworczyk’s mailbox a few months before the launch of
Poufna Rozmowa website and the Polish-speaking Telegram channel. Telegram
channel (in Russian) was used extensively as a fuel for Belarussian propaganda, which
accused Poland of organizing and funding protests in Belarus. The same content was
distributed through other Russian-speaking channels.
Apart from the content of Dworczyk’s mailbox, Poufna Rozmowa posted screens from private
mailboxes of Joachin Brudziński (PiS politician) and Piotr Bączek, former chief of Military
Counterintelligence Service (SKW). And this means the authors of Poufna Rozmowa have,
or receive from somebody else, a selected excerpt of emails from hacking attacks.
SKW is conducting a separate investigation regarding Bączek’s case but refuses to
comment.
In June 2021, two weeks after the breach into Dworczyk’s mailbox was made public, Polish
Internal Security Agency (ABW) informed that “at least 4350 email addresses” were
attacked, and “at least 500 users responded to phishing emails (…). Among attacked
addresses, over 100 belong to public figures – former and current ministers, members of
parliament, senators, local government officials.”
Our investigation suggests that private addresses of Bączek and Brudziński were on the list
of compromised emails mentioned in the ABW’s statement.

PiS office warns against phishing
We have followed a trail left by ABW, and asked new questions. What other mailboxes were
targets and which might have been compromised? Who was informed by the police about
the attacks on their mailboxes?
We have also researched the content distribution from previously known hacked accounts
and cyber-attacks patterns (i.e. spoofing domains’ lists included in cyber threat reports).
Finally, we have reconstructed a partial list of attacked mailboxes. FRONTSTORY.PL has
reasons to believe that apart from Dworczyk’s mailbox, attackers may have compromised
private mailboxes belonging to Paweł Szrot, Chief of Cabinet of President; Mariusz Kamiński,
Minister-Special Services Coordinator, and Daniel Obajtek, head of PKN Orlen, as well as
few high-ranking military officials, both in active service and retired, and family members of
people who died in Smolensk plane crash.
When we asked about the possible breaches (we sent emails before publication), we didn’t
get any comment neither from Orlen’s press office nor from Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman of
Minister-Special Services Coordinator. Paweł Szrot declined any comments on the phone.

5/11

Day after publication in the Polish media, Żaryn sent us a statement: “There is no reason to
claim that anyone gained unauthorised access to the mailbox used by Mariusz Kaminski.
Minister Kaminski did not open the content of any information which could have been used to
compromise his mailbox. He also did not provide access passwords on sites that were used
to phish for such passwords. After verification, security of the email box used by Minister
Kaminski was confirmed by authorised cyber security institutions.”
Żaryn didn’t reply to our question whether Kamiński’s private email was listed among the
hundred accounts belonging to the public figures mentioned in the ABW’s statement in 2021.
Why hackers choose such targets in particular? And to what purpose? How many mailboxes
were they able to hack? Police and prosecutor’s office are very reluctant to answer these
questions.
More forthcoming are people whose social media accounts have been used in previous onetime disinformation attacks.
Iwona Michałek, former deputy minister in the Ministry of Development, was informed about
the attack by her co-workers on 12 January 2021. “I saw a post on my account, and I wasn’t
the author,” told us the member of Agreement (Porozumienie) party. Hackers also gained
access to her mailbox and Twitter account. “I used this address both for private and official
businesses, but very seldom for the latter. I don’t think I discussed politics there. It was not
linked with ministerial mailbox,” said Michałek. When she received a notification about the
breach, she reported it to the police. “Soon after, me and my co-workers were questioned,”
she recalled.
Three weeks later, a phishing email is sent to Bogdan Rzońca, member of EP and PiS party.
“I was on a plane, flying from Brussels. I was going through my mail, and accidentally
opened one of the messages with pornographic content,” said Rzońca. When he landed in
Warsaw, he received a call from PiS offices. “Someone called and said that I was a target of
a phishing attack, and asked if I logged to my mailbox this morning. I said yes, but I didn’t
read the message,” explained Rzońca. Then, he was told a similar email was sent earlier to
Marek Suski, a member of the Polish Parliament. “I was instructed to change the password,”
said Rzońca. His assistant managed to block a Twitter account before attackers made use of
it. Rzońca didn’t report the incident to the police or prosecutor’s office.

Prosecutor writes to Panama
Phishing attacks, if successful, allowed hackers to gain access to emails. If hacked
mailboxes were linked with social media accounts, attackers could use them to post false
content on Facebook and Twitter. Most often, such posts were aligned with Russian and
Belarussian propaganda goals (i.e. attacks on NATO or Polish-Lithuanian relations).

6/11

Sometimes, they included links to fabricated stories posted on hacked websites belonging to
local media or public institutions. We have covered these tactics and methods in our
previous articles, analysing particular attacks in detail.
Similar attack was carried out on private mailbox of general Bogusław Pacek in November
2021. Attackers also hacked his Facebook and Twitter accounts, and used them to post antiUkrainian content. Hacked website belonging to a local media outlet was also used to spread
a fabricated message supposedly written by Pacek. The title read: “Shame on our
authorities! Modern-day Banderians will come to Poland.”
General’s private address was probably not on the ABW list, because he didn’t receive any
warning from the police prior to the attack. Pacek immediately informed the media about the
attack. What happened after? “People from NCBC (National Center for Cyberspace Security)
offered me help in retrieving my accounts. I was surprised, but they delivered on a promise. It
was my old, private mailbox. I used it very seldom, so I don’t think the attackers gained
anything from it, apart from one-time action with an anti-Ukrainian post,” said Pacek.
The attackers have used at least 25 public accounts in similar attacks thus far. They
belonged to members of Parliament Marcin Duszek, Marek Suski, Arkadiusz Czartoryski,
Iwona Arent, and Joanna Borowiak, Minister Marlena Maląg, Marshal of the Sejm Elżbieta
Witek (all from the ruling coalition), Andrzej Melak, as well as right-wing publicists and local
government officials. Some of the faked posts published in those attacks can still be found
online.
Prosecutor’s Office in Toruń handed the investigation of hacker attacks to the Cybercrime
Department of Bydgoszcz Provincial Police Headquarters. We have asked if any real
progress has been made on the case, but received an enigmatic answer suggesting only that
14 people are victims of the attacks investigated by the prosecutor’s office. Prosecutors also
asked German, Austrian, French, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, Panamanian, and Indian
authorities for help.
Meanwhile, separate investigation regarding Dworczyk’s mailbox is being carried out by
Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw. Did prosecutors manage to find out who hacked Prime
Minister’s aide so many months ago? “The proceedings pertinent to the case are still being
carried out, which means that no charges have been filed thus far. Currently, the
Prosecutor’s Office is in the process of gathering evidence. Bearing the interest of the
proceedings in mind, Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw will not disclose any detailed information
pertaining to the findings, and any actions, performed or planned,” informed us the Warsaw
office.
Both offices extended their investigations for additional months.

Questions still to answer

7/11

For months, Polish security services weren’t answering key questions about the biggest
cyber-espionage operation in the history of Polish politics. An operation that should have,
given the dangers of information warfare, put all intelligence on high alert. Meanwhile, Polish
security services compiled its report in October 2021, and closed the so-called “critical
incident”, although emails leaked from Dworczyk’s mailbox are being published almost every
day.
Few of the questions we have asked while researching the “Ghostwriter” operation remain
unanswered: how many groups might be involved in the entire operation? In what way their
actions might be coordinated? Do they cooperate or are they acting independently,
“providing services” for the multi-layered cyber-operation? And finally, whether any human
resources of Russian intelligence in Poland might be involved?
As we stressed in previous publications, the immediate goal of such attacks is to cause
confusion, chaos, and incite negative emotions through sensitive topics. Attacks may also
have another aspect – they are used for testing reactions, coverage, infrastructure, and even
for profiling or blackmailing specific targets.

UNC1151 attacks Ukraine
On 27 February, Facebook published a report, informing about the increased “Ghostwriter”
activity in Ukrainian internet, and the attacks carried out mostly against military officials and
public figures. “Ghostwriter typically targets people through email compromise and then uses
that to gain access to their social media accounts and post disinformation,” wrote the authors
of the report. “We detected attempts to target people on Facebook to post YouTube videos
portraying Ukrainian troops as weak and surrendering to Russia, including one video
claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest while flying a white flag of
surrender.”
Ukrainian CERT warned about mass phishing attacks and increased activity of UNC1151
group in Ukrainian internet even before the invasion. “The Minsk-based group ‘UNC1151’ is
behind these activities. Its members are officers of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of
Belarus,” informed CERT-UE. “Besides Ukrainian and Polish targets, the group is attacking
Belarusians.”
On 25 February, CERT-UA posted an additional message on Facebook with a list of domains
used in attacks.
Analysts from Proofpoint informed that cyber-attackers used hacked mailboxes belonging to
Ukrainian military officials to send fabricated messages to “target European government
personnel involved in managing the logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine” in order to trick
them into downloading malicious software. According to Proofpoint, this time the goal was “to
gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds, supplies, and
people within NATO member countries.”

Another company, Secureworks, analysed domains used in recent phishing attacks (the list
was published by Ukrainian CERT, and the attacks were attributed to UNC1151 group), and
found an additional domain cluster (accounts registered by “Apolen Zork” and “Radek
Dominik”).
New domains, exposed during the attacks, were registered in November 2021 and
afterwards. Some of them pose as Polish service providers which means that the attacks are
ongoing, and aimed against military facilities in Poland.

“Let’s not talk about the scandal”
In days following the breaking of the hack-and-leak scandal, some PiS members attentively
monitored the list of names and contacts leaked from Dworczyk’s mailbox. In unofficial talks,
few politicians even voiced their regret for not making the “email group.” Why? The group
was viewed as a circle of people closest to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. This
perspective changed only after subsequent publications of Poufna Rozmowa website. Today,
members of the ruling party are afraid of whose emails could be published next. Dworczyk
and his aides were allegedly thinking about resigning, but preparations were put on hold due
to Russia’s war in Ukraine. To this day, no one took responsibility for the scandal, or any
other incident stemming from emails leaked from Dworczyk’s mailbox.
Special services and politicians of the ruling party don’t want to answer questions regarding
the scandal and keep repeating statements that make chaos surrounding the so-called
Dworczyk Leaks only worse.
When Krzysztof Izdebski from the Stefan Batory Foundation filed a motion to the Chancellery
of the Prime Minister in February 2021, asking for disclosure of detailed information
regarding the scandal, he was pointed to statements published previously by ABW.
FRONTSTORY.PL team has been treated exactly the same for many months.
What motives drive the “ghost” behind this operation? The hack-and-leak scandal seems to
have a broader dimension than influencing the current state of political affairs in Poland. It is
rather a part of a multi-layered cyber operation aimed at destabilisation of the whole region.
We are starting a series of reports on Russian connections and influences in Poland. We
have been covering major figures of pro-Kremlin propaganda, and their operations, for years
on our vsquare.org and FRONTSTORY.PL websites and other media, publishing texts
written by Paweł Reszka, Anna Gielewska, Pavla Holcova, Szabolsc Panyi, Konrad
Szczygieł, Wojciech Cieśla, and many more. In 2016-21, we have uncovered behind-thescenes actions of Alexander Usovski, Bela Kovacs and Mateusz Piskorski. We have
exposed the gears of pro-Kremlin propaganda machine, its disinformation operations, and
assets accumulated in Poland and Central Europe. We have watched closely, how radical

9/11

groups and organizations act, including the arson attack on cultural center in Uzhorod. In
2019, we have uncovered the assets and modus operandi of Russian bank operating in
Visegrád countries.
