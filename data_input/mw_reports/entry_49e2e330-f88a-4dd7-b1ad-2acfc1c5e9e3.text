Generating a chain of unforeseen events, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack has
drastically altered the broader cyber threat landscape as we speak. As you are probably all
well aware now, law enforcement agencies identified the culprit of that malicious operation in
DarkSide. This sophisticated cybercriminal group has traditionally operated professionally
and with their own distinct flavor.
When we first wrote about DarkSide, we identified this operation as the latest example of a
growing professionalization trend within the ransomware field. First observed around August
2020, DarkSide was a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that used press releases
to communicate with victims and press, and were also among the first cybercriminal
operations to announce a ban on attacks on organizations in healthcare and education.
DarkSide became the ultimate product of some key developments that we had observed
emerging in previous months in the ransomware arena.
As a consequence of the attack on Colonial Pipeline, DarkSide claimed to have shut down its
operations last week following increasing pressure from law enforcement agencies.
Additionally, cybercriminal forums have begun banning all things ransomware from their
platforms to dissociate themselves from a threat that had become too “dangerous and toxic”,
in the words of one forum administrator. Given the recent developments in the Ransomwareas-a-Service field, it will be interesting to see how this threat actor business model will adapt
to this rapidly changing environment. This blog will analyze RaaS and try to answer some of
the questions that our team of threat intelligence nerds raised in the past few days.

What is the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Model?
In the past couple of years, the Ransomware-as-a-Service business models imposed itself
as the best method for organized ransomware operators to operate a scalable business
model by reducing the pressure on the malware developers. Ransomware became
increasingly successful and profitable for cybercriminals and its developers started
experimenting with different tactics to increase their revenues. Consequently, this model was
increasingly adopted by several cybercriminal gangs attempting to outsource some of the
activities associated with the encryption and extortion tactics to other affiliates.
Nowadays, the RaaS model can be summarized by three principal figures: operators,
affiliates, and Initial Access Brokers (IABs).

In the RaaS model, the ransomware operators own the malware source code and distribute it
to the affiliates after vetting their technical skills and their country of origin (usually native
English speakers are forbidden from participating). Other tasks typically involve negotiating
with the victims the amount and payment of the ransom and improving the ransomware
product.

Ransomware operator actively recruiting new affiliates on cybercriminal forum
Affiliates are typically offered a large share of the paid ransom, with percentage splits being
reported between 65 and 90 percent for the affiliates. Wannabe affiliates must prove their
technical skills before joining ransomware programs and are also required to find appropriate
victims.
This is where Initial Access Brokers (IABs) come into action. These figures provide affiliates
with a seemingly infinite pool of potential victims belonging to different geographies and
sectors. Affiliates typically buy corporate access from IABs for cheap and then infect those
networks with a ransomware product previously obtained by the operators. The rise of these
threat actors in addition to the growing importance of RaaS models in the threat landscape
indicates an expanding professionalization of cybercriminality. IABs allow this business
model to continuously feed on new victims cheaply and efficiently, thus making ransomware
work increasingly as a corporation rather than a criminal organization.

Going from Initial Access Brokers to Ransomware Operators

A RaaS Case Study: DarkSide
For the past couple of years, the model outlined above has worked just fine and has
provided cybercriminals with a constant stream of money into their crypto wallets. However,
the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline incident highlighted some critical flaws in the RaaS
model that now threaten to significantly affect the broader threat landscape.
Why would DarkSide target US Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)? Given the chaos
ensuing from the attack on Colonial Pipeline, it is likely that that operation was conducted by
a rogue affiliate that hadn’t realized the potential consequences of targeting CNI. The
massive international media coverage and law enforcement attention stemming from this
attack later forced DarkSide to shut down its operations— something that I’m sure its
operators weren’t keen on doing before this attack.
Suppose we apply the RaaS model described above to this operation. In that case, it is
realistic that the DarkSide affiliate that conducted the attack had previously bought remote
access from an IAB without realizing they were describing a critical company or CNI for the
US. In fact, IABs typically avoid naming the targeted company they’re selling access to avoid
giving out too much information to security researchers and law enforcement agencies.
DarkSide affiliates may have bought remote access to a general company in the oil and
energy industry with high revenue without realizing the critical importance of that
infrastructure for the US. On the other hand, it is also possible that DarkSide knew the
damage they would create but simply miscalculated the cost-risk-benefit analysis before the
attack.

How other Ransomware gangs are adapting their RaaS
Ransomware is an attack vector in continuous evolution and expansion, and what we’re
observing today may not stand the test of time as tactics change. However, analyzing how
these loose groups of operators function, where they get their revenues from, and what risks
these groups themselves face is key to understanding the threats they pose and mitigating
accordingly.
The analysis of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and its aftermath highlighted that
the existing Ransomware-as-a-Service model, albeit highly successful in past months, may
not be well suited for the current situation of hyperawareness from security researchers and
law enforcement agencies. For this reason, different threat groups associated with
ransomware operations have started a review process to adapt RaaS to the changing
environment and grant operators greater control over the potential affiliates’ targets to avoid
a second Colonial Pipeline-like incident.

Ransomware REvil operators publishing new, stricter guidelines for their affiliates’ operations
For example, the REvil operators published new guidelines following DarkSide’s attack
against Colonial Pipeline. In one of the last posts published by ransomware operators in
cybercriminal forums, REvil announced that the group will begin approving or denying
encryption of any companies the group’s affiliates want to target to avoid future social
consequences. Additionally, REvil operators restricted attacks against organizations in the
social sector and government institutions belonging to any country. Violating these rules
would result in expulsion from the affiliate program and handling a decryption key to the
victim for free.
Following the ransomware ban from most cybercriminal arenas, including both surface and
dark web forums, it is likely that these loosely affiliated criminal groups will go on and
conduct their business in private messaging channels and smaller ad hoc forums.
Additionally, that ban could cause a bump in the road for ransomware gangs as they’ve often
used those platforms to recruit more affiliates in their program. Ultimately, although some of
these groups may wait to quiet things down a bit before going back to full operations, it is
unlikely that DarkSide and Co. will simply stop engaging in criminal behavior without seizure
of their infrastructure and arrest of their leaders by law enforcement.
At the end of the day, it is essential to follow one topical principle to understand how
ransomware groups will evolve: these cybercriminals want to get rich quick and under the
radar. This observation is crucial to understanding their behavior and should always be kept
in mind when analyzing their actions.
