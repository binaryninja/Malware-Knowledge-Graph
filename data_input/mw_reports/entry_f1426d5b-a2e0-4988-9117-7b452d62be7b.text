Chinese Hacking Spree Hit an ‚ÄòAstronomical‚Äô Number of
Victims

When news hit earlier this week that Chinese hackers were actively targeting Microsoft
Exchange servers, the cybersecurity community warned that the zero-day vulnerabilities they
were exploiting might have allowed them to hit countless organizations around the world.
Now it's becoming clear just many email servers they hacked. By all appearances, the group
known as Hafnium breached as many victims they could find across the global internet,
leaving behind backdoors to return to later.
Hafnium has now exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Exchange servers' Outlook
Web Access to indiscriminately compromise no fewer than tens of thousands of email
servers, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation into the hacking campaign
who spoke to WIRED. The intrusions, first spotted by security firm Volexity, began as early as
January 6, with a noticeable uptick starting last Friday and spiking early this week. The
hackers appear to have responded to Microsoft's patch, released Tuesday, by ramping up
and automating their hacking campaign. One security researcher involved in the
investigation who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity put the number of hacked
Exchange servers at more than 30,000 in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands
worldwide, all apparently by the same group. Independent cybersecurity journalist Brian
Krebs first reported that 30,000 figure Friday, citing sources who had briefed national
security officials.

"It's massive. Absolutely massive," one former national security official with knowledge of the
investigation told WIRED. "We're talking thousands of servers compromised per hour,
globally."
‚ÄúIt's a ticking time bomb.‚Äù

In a press conference Friday afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned
anyone running the affected Exchange servers to implement Microsoft's patch for the
vulnerabilities immediately. "We are concerned that there are a large number of victims and
are working with our partners to understand the scope of this," Psaki said in a rare instance
of a White House press secretary commenting on specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
"Network owners also need to consider whether they have already been compromised and
should immediately take appropriate steps." That White House advice echoed a tweet from
former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs on Thursday
night advising anyone with an exposed Exchange server to "assume compromise" and begin
incident response measures to remove the hackers' access.
The affected networks, which likely include those of small and medium-size organizations
more than the large enterprises that tend to use cloud-based email systems, appear to have
been hacked indiscriminately via automated scanning. The hackers planted a "web shell"‚Äîa
remotely accessible, web-based backdoor foothold‚Äîon the Exchange servers they
exploited, allowing them to perform reconnaissance on the target machines and potentially
move to other computers on the network.
That means only a small number of the hundreds of thousands of hacked servers around the
world are likely to be actively targeted by the Chinese hackers, says Volexity founder Steven
Adair. Nonetheless, any organization that doesn't take pains to remove the hackers'
backdoor remains compromised, and the hackers could reenter their networks to steal data
or cause mayhem until that web shell is removed. "A massive, massive number of
organizations are getting that initial foothold," says Adair. "It's a ticking time bomb that can be
used against them at any point in time."
Though the vast majority of intrusions appear to have consisted only of those web shells, the
"astronomical" scale of those global compromises is uniquely disturbing, one security
researcher who participated in the investigation told WIRED. The small to medium-size
organizations that were compromised include local government agencies, police, hospitals,
Covid response, energy, transportation, airports, and prisons. "China just owned the world‚Äî
or at least everyone with Outlook Web Access," the researcher said. "When was the last time
someone was so bold as to just hit everyone?"

In fact, the last such mass intrusion campaign came to light in just December, with the
revelation that Russian hackers had compromised IT management tools from Solar Winds'
used by 18,000 organizations. That hacking campaign successfully breached at least half a
dozen US federal agencies. The Hafnium Exchange hacking campaign now represents the
second hacking campaign of that scale, just a few months later.
The Chinese hackers Exchange exploitation spree appears to have begun only months ago,
in contrast to the Russia's silent, year-plus SolarWinds espionage campaign. And Hafnium's
victim list appears more limited to small- and medium-sized organizations, whereas the
SolarWinds hit large US government agencies.
But as with the Russian SolarWinds hackers, investigators have yet to identify who exactly
the Hafnium hackers are‚Äîbeyond Microsoft's assertion that they're state-sponsored and
operate out of China‚Äîor to pin down the full extent of their motivations. "I don't understand
what the strategic objective of maintaining persistence on a local government agency would
be for the MSS," says the former national security official, referring to China's Ministry of
State Security. "Is this a contractor or a proxy group? Is it a Chinese cybercriminal group? Is
it a rogue actor in China that got out ahead of itself?"
While the hacking campaign may be aimed at casting a wide net before filtering targets for
espionage, the security researcher who spoke to WIRED warned that it may yet have
disruptive effects. "If they push ransomware to this, we're going to have the worst day ever,"
he says.
But unlike the SolarWinds incident, the researcher points out, the Exchange-hacking
campaign was caught early‚Äîor at least early in its widespread use. As daunting as the task
of cleaning up the hackers' tens of thousands of infections may be, that early detection may
give victims a chance to both patch their systems and remove the hackers before they can
take advantage of their foothold inside organizations. "If we had a chance to prevent a
SolarWinds-scale thing that went on for months, wouldn't we want to act on it?" asks the
researcher. "Now we have that chance if we act fast."
