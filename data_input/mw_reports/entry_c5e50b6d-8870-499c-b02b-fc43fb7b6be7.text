Tue 30 July 2019 in Ransomware
Back in 2016 Locky was (one of) the first to commercialize the "art" of holding data for ransom. I picked this strain because I
would like a bit more of a challenge in terms of obfuscation and anti-disassembly techniques, so strap in for this OG
Ransomware
Locky (at least the first few versions) is said to be created by the makers of the Dridex/Cridex banking trojans. For example
the spreading mechanism via macros in Word or Excel documents sent out via carefully crafted spear-phishing emails is
exactly the same for both of these strains.
A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below will lead to the encryption of
your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources
might be illegal depending on where you live.

this first Locky Sample was pretty unspectacular since nothing really happend

Would

you look at that! We found ourselves some poor mans obfuscation :D A whole bunch of random strings to make the analyst's
life just a little bit harder. We'll come back to this later to see if we can simplify our strings output a bit.

After a couple of seconds it spawns a new svchost.exe process with the same icon as Locky.exe had previously. Of course
we'll dump the process memory to a file (just right-click the listing in Process Hacker and choose Create dump from the
context menu).
Looking at the properties of the new svchost.exe process we can see that it is actually run from
C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Local\Temp\ and it's unsigned as well.
