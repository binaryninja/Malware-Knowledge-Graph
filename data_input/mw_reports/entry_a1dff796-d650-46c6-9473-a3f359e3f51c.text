Spear Phishing Campaign Targets Ukraine Government
and Military; Infrastructure Reveals Potential Link to SoCalled Luhansk People's Republic
fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/spear-phishing-campaign-targets-ukraine-government.html

In early 2019, FireEye Threat Intelligence identified a spear phishing email targeting
government entities in Ukraine. The spear phishing email included a malicious LNK file with
PowerShell script to download the second-stage payload from the command and control (C&C)
server. The email was received by military departments in Ukraine and included lure content
related to the sale of demining machines.
This latest activity is a continuation of spear phishing that targeted the Ukrainian Government
as early as 2014. The email is linked to activity that previously targeted the Ukrainian
Government with RATVERMIN. Infrastructure analysis indicates the actors behind the intrusion
activity may be associated with the so-called Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).
The spear phishing email, sent on Jan. 22, 2019, used the subject "SPEC-20T-MK2-000-ISS4.10-09-2018-STANDARD," and the sender was forged as Armtrac, a defense manufacturer in
the United Kingdom (Figure 1).

Figure 1: The spear phishing email
The email included an attachment with the filename "Armtrac-Commercial.7z" (MD5:
982565e80981ce13c48e0147fb271fe5). This 7z package contained "Armtrac-Commercial.zip"
(MD5: e92d01d9b1a783a23477e182914b2454) with two benign Armtrac documents and one
malicious LNK file with a substituted icon (Figure 2).

Armtrac-20T-with-Equipment-35078.pdf (MD5: 0d6a46eb0d0148aafb34e287fcafa68f) is a
benign document from the official Armtrac website.
SPEC-20T-MK2-000-ISS-4.10-09-2018-STANDARD.pdf (MD5:

website.
SPEC-10T-MK2-000-ISS-4.10-09-2018-STANDARD.pdf.lnk (MD5:
ec0fb9d17ec77ad05f9a69879327e2f9) is a malicious LNK file that executes a PowerShell
script. Interestingly, while the LNK file used a forged extension to impersonate a PDF
document, the icon was replaced with a Microsoft Word document icon.
Sponsor Potentially Active Since 2014
Compilation times indicate that this actor, who focused primarily on Ukraine, may have been
active since at least 2014. Their activity was first reported by FireEye Threat Intelligence in
early 2018. They gradually increased in sophistication and leveraged both custom and opensource malware.
The 2018 campaign used standalone EXE or self-extracting RAR (SFX) files to infect victims.
However, their recent activity showed increased sophistication by leveraging malicious LNK
files. The group used open-source QUASARRAT and the RATVERMIN malware, which we
have not seen used by any other groups. Domain resolutions and malware compile times
suggest this group may have been active as early as 2014. Filenames and malware distribution
data suggest the group is primarily focused on targeting Ukrainian entities.
Association With So-Called Luhansk People's Republic
FireEye Threat Intelligence analysis uncovered several indications that the actors behind this
activity have ties to the breakaway so-called Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).

Registrant Overlap with Official So-Called LPR Website
Infrastructure analysis suggests these operators are linked to the so-called LPR and the
persona "re2a1er1." The domain used as C&C by the previous LNK file (sinoptik[.]website) was
registered under the email "re2a1er1@yandex.ru." The email address also registered the
following domains.

One of the domains, "xn--90adzbis.xn--c1avg" is a Punycode of "мгблнр.орг," which is the
official website of the Ministry of State Security of the So-Called LPR (Figure 3). Ukraine
legislation describes so-called LPR as "temporarily occupied territory" and its government as an
"occupying administration of the Russian Federation."

Республики)
Conclusions
This actor has likely been active since at least 2014, and its continuous targeting of the
Ukrainian Government suggests a cyber espionage motivation. This is supported by the ties to
the so-called LPR's security service. While more evidence is needed for definitive attribution,
this activity showcases the accessibility of competent cyber espionage capabilities, even to
sub-state actors. While this specific group is primarily a threat to Ukraine, nascent threats to
Ukraine have previously become international concerns and bear monitoring.

Table 3: Additional malware linked to the attackers
RATVERMIN is a .NET backdoor that FireEye Threat Intelligence started tracking in March
2018. It has also been reported in public reports and blog posts.
Operators Highly Aggressive, Proactive
The actor is highly interactive with its tools and has responded within a couple of hours of
receiving a new victim, demonstrating its ability to react quickly. An example of this hands-on
style of operation occurred during live malware analysis. RATVERMIN operators observed that
the malware was running from an unintended target at approximately 1700 GMT (12:00 PM
Eastern Standard Time on a weekday) and promptly executed the publicly available Hidden
Tear ransomware (saved to disk as hell0.exe, MD5: 8ff9bf73e23ce2c31e65874b34c54eac).
The ransomware process was killed before it could execute successfully. If the Hidden Tear
continued execution, a file would have been left on the desktop with the following message:
"Files have been encrypted with hidden tear. Send me some bitcoins or kebab. And I also hate
night clubs, desserts, being drunk."
When live analysis resumed, the threat group behind the attack started deleting all the analysis
tools on the machine. Upon resetting the machine and executing the malware again, this time
with a text file open asking why they sent ransomware, the threat group responded by sending
the following message via RATVERMIN's C&C domain (Figure 6):
