Brad Duncan published IcedID (Bokbot) from fake Microsoft Teams page earlier this week. In
this video I take a closer look at the PCAP file in that blog post.
Note: This video was recorded in a Windows Sandbox to minimize the risk of infecting
the host PC in case of accidental execution of a malicious payload from the network
traffic.
As I have previously pointed out, IcedID sends beacons to the C2 server with a 5 minute
interval. According to Kai Lu’s blog post A Deep Dive Into IcedID Malware: Part 2, this 5
minute interval is caused by a call to WaitForSingleObject with a millisecond timeout
parameter of 0x493e0 (300,000), which is exactly 5 minutes.
The IcedID trojan uses a custom BackConnect protocol in order to interact with victim
computers through VNC, a file manager or by establishing a reverse shell. There was no
IcedID BackConnect traffic in this particular PCAP file though, but several other IcedID

capture files published on malware-traffic-analysis.net do contain IcedID BackConnect traffic.
For more information on this proprietary protocol, please see our blog post IcedID
BackConnect Protocol.

Network Forensics Training

2/4

Check out our upcoming live network forensics classes for more hands-on network forensic
analysis. Our current class material doesn’t include any IcedID traffic though, instead you’ll
get to investigate C2 traffic from Cobalt Strike, TrickBot, njRAT, Meterpreter and a few others.
