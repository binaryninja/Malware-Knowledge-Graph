Talos recently observed a malicious campaign offering fake installers of popular
software as bait to get users to execute malware on their systems.
This campaign includes a set of malware distribution campaigns that started in late
2018 and have targeted mainly Canada, along with the U.S., Australia and some EU
countries.
Two undocumented malware families (a backdoor and a Google Chrome extension)
are consistently delivered together in these campaigns.
An unknown actor with the alias "magnat" is the likely author of these new families and
has been constantly developing and improving them.
The attacker's motivations appear to be financial gain from selling stolen credentials,
fraudulent transactions and Remote Desktop access to systems.

Introduction
Talos recently observed a malware distribution campaign that tries to trick users into
executing fake software installers of popular software on their systems. We believe with
moderate confidence that online advertising is used to reach potential victims that are
searching for software to install on their systems. The combination of advertising and fake
software installers is particularly tricky, as the users reached by the ads are already
predisposed to execute an installer on their systems.
Once the fake installers run, they execute three pieces of malware on the victim's system:
A password stealer that collects all the credentials available on the system.
A "backdoor" that sets up remote access via a stealth Microsoft Remote Desktop
session by forwarding the RDP port through an SSH tunnel, allowing access to
systems even when behind a firewall.
A malicious browser extension that contains several information-stealing features, such
as keylogging and taking screenshots.
Password stealers have long presented a risk to individuals and to companies. The
compromised accounts are frequently sold in underground forums and may lead to additional
compromise using the stolen accounts and through password reuse. The chrome extension
adds to this risk by allowing the theft of credentials used on the web that may not be stored
in the system. Additionally, the use of an SSH tunnel to forward RDP to an external server
provides attackers with a reliable way to login remotely to a system, bypassing firewall
control.

The campaigns

2/26

The attack begins when a victim looks for a particular piece of software for download. Talos
believes the attacker has set up an advertising campaign that will present links to a web
page, offering the download of a software installer. The installer has many different file
names. For example: viber-25164.exe, wechat-35355.exe, build_9.716-6032.exe,
setup_164335.exe, nox_setup_55606.exe and battlefieldsetup_76522.exe.
When executed, this installer does not install the actual software it announces, but instead
executes a malicious loader on the system.

3/26

The installer/loader is an SFX-7-Zip archive or a nullsoft installer that decodes and drops a
legitimate AutoIt interpreter, and three obfuscated AutoIt scripts that decode the final
payloads in memory and inject them into the memory of another process.
The final payloads are almost always the same three specific pieces of malware:
A commodity password stealer. Initially Azorult and currently Redline. Both steal all the
credentials it can find on the system. These password stealers are widely known and
documented and we will analyse them further on this post.
A backdoor, or backdoor installer that we are calling "MagnatBackdoor," that configures
the system for stealthy RDP access, adds a new user and sets a scheduled task to
periodically ping the C2 and, when instructed, create an outbound ssh tunnel
forwarding the RDP service.
An installer for a chrome extension, that we are calling "MagnatExtension," that packs
several features useful for stealing data from the web browser: a form grabber,
keylogger, screenshotter, cookie stealer and arbitrary JavaScript executor, among
others.

Campaign timeline
Based on our telemetry and on build dates of analyzed samples, we built a timeline that
helps us understand the actor's activities.

Our telemetry is focused only on MagnatBackdoor activity and shows that at the end of 2019,
MagnatBackdoor was being distributed through early 2020. From that moment on, we had
little to no visibility of MagnatBackdoor again until April 2021 when the activity seems to have
restarted.
4/26

The telemetry data aligns with the build dates of the samples we have found through OSINT.
We found almost no samples built between February and October 2020. However, we found
samples built in late 2020 and early 2021, for which we had no visibility in the telemetry.
There are several possible reasons for this — most likely, these may have been used in test
or smaller scale campaigns.
We also found several interesting pieces of information:
The oldest MagnatExtension sample we found was dated August 2018. From that date
until late 2019, we found several samples that delivered the extension and Azorult
stealer.
The oldest MagnatBackdoor sample we found is from October 2019. From that
moment on, all samples we found contain the trio
MagnatBackdoor/MagnatExtension/Azorult.
In February 2020, just before the large activity gap, Azorult stopped being part of the
trio of malware. This was possibly a consequence of the release of Chrome 80 that is
known to have broken several malware families.
We found a small number of samples built in February that include Vidar Stealer and
Gozi, suggesting that the attacker may have been testing Azorult replacements.
In October 2020 the actor started testing Redline Stealer, creating some samples using
Redline configured with the ID "testing";
The campaigns that followed used the Redline / MagnatBackdoor / MagnatExtension
trio. Interestingly, these campaigns contain Redline IDs that are allusive to advertising
campaigns (e.g., ads, ads3, ads5, ads6, ads7, ads8, eumix3, eumix4).
We are not sure if the use of malvertising started in October, after the Redline introduction,
with the "ads" bot ID. However, we believe with moderate confidence (although evidence
suggests it, we have not seen the actual ads), that malvertising is a delivery method used by
the author.
We started suspecting of malvertising after analysing a few compromised systems. The
malicious installer had been downloaded using google chrome, and there was no local email
client open. The browser had communicated only with cloudflare and google IPs at the
moment of the download and in one case, a few seconds prior to the download the browser
had visited a software review website.
These behaviours are not conclusive and they can be explained by other reasons (e.g.
blackhat SEO, a webmail link). However, we later found the Redline botnet IDs (ads, ads3,
ads5, etc.) which strengthened the malvertising theory. Finally, we found a tweet from August
2021 by a security researcher mentioning an ongoing malvertising campaign, posting
screenshots of the ads and sharing one of the downloaded samples.

5/26

After analyzing the sample referred to in this tweet, we verified that it is one of the samples
that includes MagnatBackdoor, MagnatExtension and Redline (botnet: ads7).

Victimology
Because we are looking at a trio of malware with activity since 2018 with multiple C2
addresses used in every month of activity, it's not easy to find a way to study the targets of
these campaigns. However, the domain stataready[.]icu has been used as the
MagnatExtension C2 since January 2019 and it is still used today in the settings received
from the C2 servers as the updated C2. It aggregates the traffic from infected systems in

6/26

several campaigns, providing a good overall picture of the infection distribution through
Passive DNS.

Passive DNS shows us the frequency of DNS queries for the C2 address. By looking at the
relative distribution of the origin of these queries we can have a picture of the Countries more
affected by the malware.
The relatively focused distribution of this malware is consistent with the use of advertising as
a distribution channel. There is a clear focus on Canada (roughly 50 percent of the
infections), followed by the U.S. and Australia.
There are also several infections in Italy, Spain and Norway (Redline's ID "eumix" hinted at
some interest in European countries).
More than 50 percent of the infections are in Canada, which leads us to wonder if there is
any more specific target in that country. However, there is no domain specified in the
MagnatExtension settings that is specific to Canada, and neither MagnatBackdoor or Redline
stealer provide any hints.

Malware analysis

The loader
7/26

The loader is a .exe or a .iso file pretending to be a software installer. When executed, it
creates several files and executes a set of commands that ultimately lead to the execution of
the final malware payloads.
We have seen similar loaders delivering other malware and documented by other
researchers and believe that the loader is not specific to these campaigns.
There are two loader types that, although different in the installer technology used, are very
similar in the technique that obfuscates and executes the payloads. A 7-Zip sfx (selfextracting archive) is on one loader, and on the other is a NSI (NullSoft Installer) file.
Opening one of the 7-Zip SFX-based loaders with the 7Z SFX builder, we can see the
commands that are set to be executed on extraction.

In this case, the loader uses certutil to decode three of the contained files (dera, sfera and
bruto) into three files that are very large and highly obfuscated autoIT scripts. Finally, the file
dos.com (a legitimate autoIT interpreter) is used to execute each of the scripts.
On the NSI based loader, opening the file with 7-Zip, we can see the contents of the archive.
The $APPDATA folder contains the files to be dropped and the $PLUGINSDIR contains NSI
specific files. Finally, the [NSIS].nsi file contains the commands that will be executed.

8/26

As seen in the image above, copto.vsdm seems to be the only cmd file executed. Extracting
this file from the $APPDATA folder and opening it reveals a set of commands that are similar
in sequence to the one in the 7-Zip file.

Like before, the script performs three times the same actions, with different files:
FIrst, a new file is created containing only the "MZ" chars in it.
Then, findstr extracts only the relevant parts from a file filled with junk data and writes
them to the file with "MZ." This action decodes and writes the legitimate AutoIt
interpreter to the system.
9/26

Then, a large AutoIt script is copied to a new file with a name of only one character.
Finally, as before, the AutoIt interpreter is used to execute the AutoIt script.
In both cases, the created script contains the final payload and is very obfuscated. Once
executed, it creates a new process (usually the AutoIt interpreter that started it) and injects
the final payload into its memory where it will be executed.

MagnatBackdoor
MagnatBackdoor is an AutoIt-based installer that prepares a system for remote Microsoft
Remote Desktop access and forwards the RDP service port on an outbound SSH tunnel. As
a result of this installer's actions there is a way for the attacker to access the system
remotely via RDP, which is why we call it a backdoor.
This malware applies this technique by setting up a scheduled task that periodically contacts
a C2 server and sets up the tunnel if instructed by the C2 response. The following image
summarizes the actions taken by the backdoor.

10/26

Analysing the malware sample we find that it was built using AutoIt scripting and then
transformed into an executable file. This process leaves several artifacts in the binary that
provide useful information.

The previous image shows the result of the AutoIt extractor tool. It reveals:
The build path, including the username magnat. This is the same on all samples we
found and it's the reason we call it MagnatBackdoor and, by extension, the magnat
campaigns.
The build path also includes a string "\rdp\new\" that reveals the malware version
("new") and a string "vago2" that we believe to be an organizational path, equivalent to
a botnet "group" or "id."
The time of file creation and last write. This date was key in building the campaign
timeline.
The list of files packed within the executable.
Based on the build path string, we found samples containing the following versions:
"rdp/rdp," "rdp/3.5," "rdp/3.6" and "rdp/new." The changes between versions seemed to be
mostly bug fixes and improvements, such as adding some obfuscation to the network
protocol. We will focus on the version "new" as it is built upon all previous versions.
The main AutoIt script contains all code and logic needed to install the files we observed in
the file list into the file system and to execute several scripts. The final objective is to have a
set of scheduled tasks (STs) configured on the system that ensure persistence and that
11/26

connect to the C2 requesting a command for execution. The following schema shows the key
sections of the main installer code.

All the scripts starting with PERFORMSCRIPT are very similar. They receive as parameters
a set of file paths and variables and create a scheduled task XML descriptor by invoking one
of the create_xml files and then register the scheduled task using the schtasks.exe
command with the generated XML.

There are three files that create scheduled tasks. By creating these as scheduled tasks,
some additional resiliency is added to the malware. For example, if the added user is
removed, it will be re-added after some time.
The first of the scheduled files is add_user.js. This script is responsible for creating a new
user, assigning the appropriate permissions and groups and finally configuring the windows
firewall to allow RDP communication.

12/26

The second scheduled script is obf_pinger_part2.vbs. This script uses some very simplistic
obfuscation and is mostly responsible for installing RDPWrapper. RDPWrapper is an opensource tool that makes very useful improvements to RDP. From the project's GitHub:

The third and last scheduled script is checkFscr.vbs. The checkFscr.vbs script has two main
responsibilities: installing plink.exe (an SSH command line tool for Windows) and requesting
a command from the C2 server, as shown in the following image.

13/26

The function will receive an obfuscated string containing the username, password and
pinger_id on the first line of the snippet. It will then build a string that includes the C2 domain
declared in line 2, information about the OS, the system user, the pinger file version and the
received string and perform an HTTP GET request to the C2 server, sending all this
information in the querystring.
If the server responds with an HTTP status code of 201, the response body will be appended
to the "plink.exe" command. This allows the attacker to send a plink command that creates
an ssh tunnel to a remote server, forwarding the local RDP port to be used for remote
access.

MagnatExtension
We also found a malicious Google Chrome extension delivered in all these campaigns.
Because of its prevalence in samples that deliver MagnatBackdoor and because we have
not seen it elsewhere, we call it MagnatExtension.
MagnatExtension is delivered by an executable whose only function is to prepare the system
and install the extension. Notice that this extension is installed from the malware itself and
not from the Chrome Extension Store. Once installed, the extension is visible in the
extensions settings as "Google's Safe browsing."

14/26

The extension itself is made of three files — a manifest file, an icon and a background.js file
that contains the malicious code that runs in the background while the browser is running.
The extension code is obfuscated using several techniques, such as function redirects,
encrypted substitution arrays, function wrappers and string encoding.

We deobfuscated the JavaScript using a custom Python script. After deobfuscation, we
analyzed the code to understand the extension's capabilities.
Features
This extension is very similar in its features to a banking trojan. It periodically connects to a
C2 to receive the updated configuration settings. Those settings are then used to control the
behavior of the features that allow stealing data from the browser, such as a form grabber,
15/26

keylogger and screenshotter, among others. The following image summarizes the extension
behavior and features.

In the extension code, at the end of the file, there is a code section where the extension sets
up the event listeners shown in the previous image.

Going through each of the listeners is an effective way to cover most of the extension
features:
Form grabber: The extension listener will capture the onBeforeRequest event whenever a
web request is about to be made. This allows it to look at the configuration and, if the current
URL is in the "form_URL_filter" list, it will read the form using the window["requestBody"]
["formData"] property and send it to the C2 in a "form" action message type.

16/26

History and scripts: When a browser tab is updated, the extension checks if the tab is loading
a URL. If so, the extension sends a "history" request to the C2, which tells the C2 the URL
the browser is loading. Finally, it compares the tab URL with the URLs in the "URL_mask"
field of each item in the "script" section of the config. If there is a match, the code in the
"code" field of the matching item is executed in the tab. This way, the extension can
completely replace the content of a page while leaving the address bar URL and the SSLl
icon untouched.
Keylogger: When a browser tab is updated, the extension checks if the tab is loading a URL.
If so, the extension compares the tab URL with the URLs in the "keylogger" section of the
config. If there is a match, the extension executes the keylogger code in the tab.
The keylogger code running in the tab captures all keys pressed by the user and it then
sends the log back to the extension code through a chrome message, for which there is a
listener set up.
Screenshoter: When a browser tab is updated, the extension checks if the tab has completed
a URL loading. If so, the extension compares the tab URL with the URLs in the
"screenshoter" section of the config. If there is a match, the extension executes the
chrome['tabs']['captureVisibleTab'] function to capture a screenshot and then sends it to the
C2 in a "screenshoter" type request.
The C2 communication happens as a result of one of the previously described features and
in two additional moments:
Periodic ping: The extension sets up an alarm that will trigger every minute that sends a
"plugin" type message to the C2 server that contains the extension ID version. The server
reply is a JSON string that contains the fields cookie and keylogger. If the cookie variable is
true, the extension will collect and send all cookies to the C2 server. The keylogger field
switches on or off a global boolean variable. In earlier versions, this was used to disable the
keylogger but it has been deactivated in the latest version.
Request settings: The extension sets up an alarm that will trigger every 30 minutes and will
trigger an HTTP GET request to the C2 server settings path without any additional data. If
new settings are received, they will be stored in the browser's local storage.
Bot settings
As previously mentioned, most features use the settings file to check if a particular web page
requires action or not. This setting is provided by the C2 server and stored locally. It has the
following structure:

17/26

The settings have changed slightly over time. However, the C2 servers are still the same and
have been working for around three years, so the old settings are still available.
The most recent version - settings3.json:

Earlier version - settings2.json:

First version - settings.json:

18/26

The first settings version (settings.json) does not contain a server because it was not
possible to update the C2 via the settings file. The settings2.json adds the server field and
the latest version (settings3.json) contains a form grabber active for Facebook URLs. The
screenshotter has been active since the first version for the same set of URLs. This suggests
the attacker's motivation is to observe the balances of PayPal accounts and cryptocurrency
wallets and, possibly, request the cookies of those systems.

C2 communications
The C2 address is hardcoded in the sample, and it can be updated by the current C2 with a
list of additional C2 files. Interestingly, although this is disabled in recent versions, when the
server check fails, the extension can try to obtain a new C2 address from a Twitter hashtag
search.

The following tweets show the hashtags we found in use:

19/26

The algorithm for getting the domain from the tweet is very simple: concatenating the first
letter of each word. Using the previous tweets as an example, the domains are:
stataready.icu and bolshebolshezolota.club.
Once an active C2 is available, the data is sent in json format in the body of an HTTP POST
request. This json string is encrypted. In the next section we will describe the encryption
used. The following json message types exist:

Each message type "action" value matches one of the previously described features.
Additionally, the "plugin" action is used for the periodic ping message type and its reply
contains only two fields used to request the browser cookies and to disable the keylogger.

20/26

The settings request is different. An HTTP GET request to the settings path (settings.json,
settings2.json or settings3.json) without any extra data. The response is the configuration file
as described in the previous section.
Communication encryption
Communication with the C2 is done via HTTP (SSL is used in all the samples we saw) and
cryptography is used to protect the message contents. In all communication to the c2, the
HTTP body contains a JSON string containing the encryption key encrypted with the server's
public key, the AES encrypted text, the initialization vector and a salt.

The code used to encrypt the data is:

The communication from C2 to bot is unencrypted on the pinger replies but the settings
response contains a json with encrypted data in the following format.

The key is not sent this time, it is hardcoded in the decryption function as follows.

21/26

After some research we have concluded that the encryption library and the json string
formats used by the extension are based on the cryptojs library, an open source javascript
cryptography library.

Conclusion
This research documents a set of malicious campaigns that have been going on for around
three years, delivering a trio of malware, including two previously undocumented families
(MagnatBackdoor and MagnatExtension). During this time, these two families have been
subject to constant development and improvement by their authors — this is likely not the
last we hear of them.
We believe these campaigns use malvertising as a means to reach users that are interested
in keywords related to software and present them links to download popular software. This
type of threat can be very effective and requires that several layers of security controls are in
place, such as, endpoint protection, network filtering and security awareness sessions.
Based on the use of password stealers and a Chrome extension that is similar to a banking
trojan, we assess that the attacker's goals are to obtain user credentials, possibly for sale or
for his own use in further exploitation. The motive for the deployment of an RDP backdoor is
unclear. The most likely are the sale of RDP access, the use of RDP to work around online
service security features based on IP address or other endpoint installed tools or the use of
RDP for further exploitation on systems that appear interesting to the attacker.
