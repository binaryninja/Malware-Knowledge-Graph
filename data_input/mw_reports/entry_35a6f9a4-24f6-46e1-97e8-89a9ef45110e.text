from China Preying on Ukraine

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

On March 22, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) reported its
findings of a new backdoor targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.
Known as HeaderTip, this backdoor is thought to be tied to an APT group named Scarab,
which has been linked to China. Scarab has targeted the U.S. and Russia in the past, but
HeaderTip is the threat group’s first attack that we’ve seen specifically targeting Ukraine
post invasion. This makes it one of the first examples of attackers linked to China actively
exploiting the current situation in Ukraine.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
A Closer Look at Lure Documents and Infection Techniques
As we’ve seen in recent weeks with malware such as SunSeed, many threat actors have
taken note of the current political tension in Ukraine. Attackers are taking advantage of this
situation to emotionally manipulate people to the point where they fall prey to phishing
attacks.
The Scarab group has taken a similar approach with spreading HeaderTip. The original
phishing email can vary, but it ultimately results in the delivery of a RAR archive to the
victim’s endpoint. Opening and extracting that RAR file gives you an EXE file that
masquerades as a PDF file containing a message such as the one described in the notice
from CERT-UA. That file purports to be from the National Police of Ukraine, regarding the
need to preserve video evidence of crimes committed by the Russian military.
To people currently residing in Ukraine, those who have been forced to flee, or even
individuals in neighboring countries, any new information on this subject could be seen as
crucial to them. Threat actors such as Scarab know this, and they have no qualms about
weaponizing the populace’s need for up to date information on the situation to spread
malware like the HeaderTip backdoor.
Launching that EXE file silently installs and loads the malware. While doing so, it also
launches an actual PDF file with the expected information, to trick the victim into thinking
that's all that has happened.
For this instance of the HeaderTip backdoor, Scarab uses a PDF file with a title that
translates as “On the preservation of video recordings of criminal actions of the army of the
Russian Federation” (as shown in Figure 1, below).

At the time of writing this, once HeaderTip is loaded, it only appears to beacon out to its
command-and-control (C2) server, waiting for updates. While we are not certain what is to
come from this backdoor, it is likely that this is just the first stage of an attack.
BlackBerry will continue monitoring this situation and will provide updates as more
information becomes available.

File Contents
3/7

After opening the delivery archive, we are left with a single file. While it may have the icon
for a PDF file, a closer look will reveal that it is a standard executable (.EXE). This
executable will act as a loader for HeaderTip and its associated files.
Looking at the resource section for the loader, shown in Figure 2 below, we see resource
data labeled 101, 102, and 103. These items are the files to be loaded from the delivery
executable, including their respective names in the beginning of each section.
RCDATA 101 - “#2163_02_33-2022.pdf” (PDF lure document)
RCDATA 102 - “officecleaner.bat” (batch file for executing HeaderTip)
RCDATA 103 - “officecleaner.dat” (loader containing HeaderTip backdoor)

For a simplified view, Figure 3 shows the initial loader from the delivery archive in the left
window. The right window shows all files used during execution to establish the HeaderTip
backdoor. This list of files includes those in the loader’s resource section, as well as the
actual backdoor (httpshelper.dll) after it has been built with assistance from the batch file.

Execution
When the initial loader is executed, it begins running a batch file (“officecleaner.bat”) to
assist in installing the backdoor, as seen in the code in Figure 4.

This code performs the following steps:
Define HeaderTip as httpshelper.dll

4/7

Append HeaderTip data to the helper DLL from officecleaner.dat
Add a registry key under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run to
achieve persistence
Execute HeaderTip backdoor
To verify that this threat is achieving persistence, we can look at the process tree for the
loader executable (as shown in Figure 5), where it shows us the command that is being run
to add the registry key. This persistence will ensure that HeaderTip can continue to beacon
out for updates in the future.

At this point, HeaderTip is ready and running, and will repeatedly make HTTP POST
requests to the associated C2 server shown in Figure 6. Until it receives further updates on
what to download next, we believe this is the current extent of this threat’s performance.

While right now HeaderTip is rather basic in its processes, it remains a mystery what
Scarab might decide to send as further updates for the second stage of this attack.
Awareness of this first step gives us a leg up in detecting and mitigating any future
destructive activity.

Mitigation Tips
When it comes to phishing scams, user education and discretion is always key. Always
exercise caution before opening any email attachments or links and make sure that each
email you’re reading is coming from a known, trusted source.
