ACAD/Medre.A
10000‘s of AutoCAD Designs Leaked
in Suspected Industrial Espionage

ACAD/Medre.A

Summary
Recently the worm, ACAD/Medre.A, showed a big spike in Peru on
ESET’s Live Grid® (a cloud-based malware collection system utilizing
data from ESET users worldwide). ESET’s research shows that the worm
steals AutoCAD drawings and sends them to email accounts located
in China. ESET has worked with Chinese ISP Tencent, Chinese National
Computer Virus Emergency Response Center and Autodesk, the creator of
AutoCAD, to stop the transmission of these files. ESET confirms that tens
of thousands of AutoCAD drawings, primarily from users in Peru, were
leaking at the time of the discovery.
“After some configuration, ACAD/Medre.A sends opened AutoCAD
drawings by e-mail to a recipient with an e-mail account at the Chinese
163.com internet provider. It will try to do this using 22 other accounts at
163.com and 21 accounts at qq.com, another Chinese internet provider.”
“ACAD/Medre.A represents a serious case of possible industrial espionage.
Every new design is sent automatically to the operator of this malware.
Needless to say this can cost the legitimate owner of the intellectual
property a lot of money as the cybercriminals have access to the designs
even before they go into production. They may even have the guts to apply
for patents on the product before the inventor has registered it at the
patent office.”

ACAD/Medre.A

The Story
The malware news today is all about new targeted, high-tech, military
grade malicious code such as Stuxnet, Duqu and Flamer that have grabbed
headlines. So imagine our surprise when an AutoLISP virus, AutoLISP is the
scripting language that AutoCAD uses, suddenly showed a big spike in one
country on ESET’s Live Grid® two months ago, and this country is Peru.

We have seen other small number of infections of ACAD/Medre.A in
other countries, but they are all in countries that are near Peru or have
a large Spanish speaking contingent. The odd one out in the infection
table would be the People’s Republic of China, but not quite so weird
when we started to analyze the virus based on this sudden spike. More
about China will follow later.
Of course it does not mean much that we see high detection numbers
because they may not all be live infections. But watching ESET’s Live
Grid®, where we can also see detections at specific URLs, which made
it clear that a specific website supplied the AutoCAD template that
appears to be the basis for this localized spike as this template was
also infected with ACAD/Medre.A. If it is assumed that companies
which want to do business with the entity have to use this template,
it seems logical that the malware mainly shows up in Peru and
neighboring countries. The same is true for larger companies with
affiliated offices outside this area that have been asked to assist or
to verify the – by then – infected project and then infecting their own
environment. Other information that is described later also points to
live infections.

ACAD/Medre.A

So what exactly is ACAD/Medre.A?

Technical Analysis

ACAD/Medre.A is a worm written in AutoLISP, a dialect of the LISP
programming language used in AutoCAD.

In short, the functions carried out by the worm are:

ESET detects it as ACAD/Medre.A worm, however the malware also
has characteristics which are attributed to a virus or a trojan. It’s a
worm, because it aids its spreading by copying its body into the folder
of any opened AutoCAD drawing on the infected system (similarly to
the way worms create autorun.inf entries on removable media), so
if the user would compress the AutoCAD project folder and send it to
someone else, they would be sending the worm along with it.It’s a
trojan, as it mostly relies on the user to - inadvertently, but manually
– download it onto his system. It sneaks in alongside legitimate
AutoCAD drawings. Or, in a way, it’s also a virus, as it infects the
installed AutoCAD environment (similarly to the way the Win32/
Induc virus infected the Delphi environment). But it doesn’t infect
executable files like a common parasitic virus.

1. Copying itself to various locations: This serves two main purposes: to
ensure its repeated execution (i.e. installation) and chance to spread
(distribution).
2. The malicious payload: Stealing AutoCAD drawings from the infected
system.
In the following text, we’ll document how these tasks are accomplished.
Although the malware is written in AutoLISP, its main functions are
carried out by Visual Basic Scripts, which are dropped and executed by the
VBS interpreter (Wscript.exe) that is integrated in the operating system
since Windows 2000. This is shown in the following code snippet, where
the VBS script was previously stored to the MK-INFO-BIN variable.

But terminology aside, let’s take a look at what the Medre malware
does.

ACAD/Medre.A

ACAD/Medre.A (its original filename is acad.fas – the hidden file that
was planted alongside a legitimate DWG) tries to copy itself to the
following locations:

ACAD/Medre.A also modifies the acad20??.lsp file inside the AutoCAD
Support directory. First, it checks which version of AutoCAD is
installed, in order to determine the correct filename:

• %windir%\System32\Acad.fas
• %windir%\ Acad.fas
• %current_working_directory_of_DWG%\cad.fas
• %current_ working_directory_of_DWG%\acad.fas
• %ACAD_support_directory%\cad.fas
• %ACAD_support_directory%\acad.fas
Here’s an example of a VBS script from the worm to perform these
copy operations:

ACAD/Medre.A

Interestingly, the malware authors provide compatibility for AutoCAD
versions 2000 (14.0) through 2015 (19.2).
Once the correct filename is determined, the worm tries to locate the
acad20??.lsp file and add one line of code („(if (findfile „cad.fas“)(load
„cad.fas“))“) to it:

The abovementioned actions ensure that the malicious code is executed
whenever an AutoCAD drawing (.DWG) is opened on the infected system.
More information on automatic loading of AutoLISP routines can be found
in the official AutoCAD documentation.
In addition to this, there’s a reason why the script (even when already
running on an infected system) is copied to the directory of the currently
opened DWG. If the user, would want to send his drawings to someone
else, it is likely that he will add the whole directory into an archive and
send the worm along with it.

Payload

If the file is not present, it is created with the following
content:Automating the deobfuscation of these 3 techniques makes it
much easier to understand the behavior of the malware.

After some configuration, ACAD/Medre.A will be sending the different
AutoCAD drawings (and other information) that are opened by e-mail to a
recipient with an e-mail account at the Chinese 163.com internet provider.
It will try to do this using one of 22 other accounts at 163.com and one of 21
accounts at qq.com, another Chinese internet provider. Remarkably, this
is done by accessing smtp.163.com and smtp.qq.com with the different
account credentials. It is ill advised to have port 25 outgoing allowed other
than to your own ISP. Obviously the Internet Providers in Peru do allow
this. Also it is reasonable to assume that the companies that are a victim
of this suspected industrial espionage malware do not have their firewalls
configured to block port 25 either.

ACAD/Medre.A

Stealing AutoCAD Drawings
The worm contains two arrays of email account names and
passwords (22 accounts at 163.com and 21 accounts at qq.com) which
are set in the From field of the outgoing email and used for SMTP
authentication. Here’s a code snippet showing the selection of which
email address to use (with the credentials themselves blurred):

The following figure shows the VBS script responsible for sending the
drawing files to the attacker:

Notice the use of CPUTICKS for randomization (the NTH function
selects the Nth value of an array).

ACAD/Medre.A

Note that the variables PRINC-YFMC, PRINC-YJFWQ, PRINC-YFM and
PRINC-YXMM are filled with values corresponding to the randomly
selected email address, SMTP server, email username, email password,
respectively. VL-FILE-FNAM-H points to the currently opened DWG (it is
included as an attachment and the file path in the email body) and VLINFO-C is a concatenation of the computer name and user name:

and the following strings are appended to create paths to the files for
exfiltration:
• "\Address\Address.INDX“
• "\Address\Address.BOX“
• "\Address\Send.INDX“
• "\Address\Send.BOX“

Note that due to a programming error this part of code may not work.
The stealing / emailing mechanism is similar as described above.
Lastly, the worm prepares a RAR archive, also to be sent by email.

Other Exfiltrated Data
Apart from emailing the stolen AutoCAD drawings, the worm also
contains code for stealing e-mail client files, as well as a copy of itself
and auxiliary information.
ACAD/Medre.A can steal Outlook .PST files (Outlook Personal Folders),
as referenced by the following Registry keys:
• [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Catalog]
• [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Catalog]
• [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\13.0\Outlook\Catalog]

and files belonging to the Foxmail email client. The installation directory
of Foxmail is queried from the Registry entry:
• [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Aerofox\Foxmail] "Executable”

ACAD/Medre.A

The contents of the directory compressed in the encrypted RAR
archive (password = “1”) are:
- Acad.fas (worm body)
- È¤Î¶»úÐµÖÆÍ¼.dxf
(“È¤Î¶»úÐµÖÆÍ¼” is 趣味机械制图 in Chinese encoding).
The .DXF file (AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format) is generated by
ACAD/Medre.A and contains metadata regarding the stolen AutoCAD
drawing:

ACAD/Medre.A

Other Information
ACAD/Medre.A uses the following Registry entries to store its internal
data, such as timestamps:
• [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting]
“FILE”
“FILE-G”
“FILE-H”
“Time”
Note that the [HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows
Error Reporting] Registry key is a legitimate one, only the 4
abovementioned entries are used by the malware.
MD5 of the analysed sample: 7b563740f41e495a68b70cbb22980b20

The Stolen Data
When our analysts looked into the e-mail accounts used by ACAD/
Medre.A, they noticed that the Inbox for each of them was already
full (over 100,000 mails). All of the messages in the Inbox were errormessages as the Inbox of the final recipient is full. And there were still
almost 5,000 emails to be sent.

As the path and filename are sent with the attachment, we could
do some analysis just based on the location where the drawings
are stored and their possible content. Our analysis also shows
that several people actually use an Administrator Account or store
their projects on the Desktop. The pie-chart does not reflect all the
different possibilities, just the most frequently used ones.

A Call for Further Action…
This is a significant amount of data leakage and we felt it called for
further action. Upon realisation of the magnitude of the problem ESET
reached out to Tencent, owners of the qq.com domain. Due to swift
quick action on the part of Tencent the accounts used for relaying
the e-mails with the drawings have been blocked and thus no further
leakage will occur. We would like to express our appreciation to the
distinguished team at Tencent’s Desktop Security Business Division for
their cooperation and their prompt action.
ESET has also reached out to CVERC, the Chinese National Computer
Virus Emergency Response Center, and they also responded quickly by
word of the First Deputy Director of CVERC, who also assisted in getting
the accounts removed.

From our analysis of all the used e-mail accounts we can derive the scale
of the attack and conclude that tens of thousands of AutoCAD drawings
(blueprints) leaked.

After the discovery of ACAD/Medre.A, ESET decided to make a free
stand-alone cleaner available. The utility can be found here 		
[http://download.eset.com/special/EACADMedreCleaner.exe].
We established contacts with Autodesk, producers of AutoCAD, who
immediately took the problem seriously and full assistance was given.

Conclusion
ACAD/Medre.A is a serious example of suspected industrial espionage.
Every new design created by a victim is sent automatically to the
authors of this malware. Needless to say this can cost the legitimate
owner of the intellectual property a lot of money as the cybercriminals
will have designs before they even go into production by the original
designer. The attacker may even go so far as to get patents on the
product before the inventor has registered it at the patent office. The
inventor may not know of the security breach until his patent claim is
denied due to prior art.
If there is one thing that becomes obvious from our experience with this
piece of malware it is that reaching out to other parties to minimize
damage is not only the right thing to do, it really works. We could have
tried to clean up the problem without the assistance of Autodesk,
Tencent and CVERC and solely focus on removal of the malware from
the infected machines. By working with Autodesk, Tencent and CVERC,
we were able to not only alert and inform users but also defeat the
e-mail relay system used by the attackers and deny them access to the
e-mail boxes, so the damage is now contained.
