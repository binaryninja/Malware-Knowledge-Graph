Ransomware
Estimated reading time: 6 minutes
Since the infamous Conti ransomware group disbanded due to source code leaks during the
Russia-Ukraine war, the LockBit group has claimed dominance. The group has adopted new
extortion techniques and added a first-of-its-kind bug-bounty program, along with many
features, to advance their new leak site. Upon investigation and analysis, we have
determined that the new LockBit 3.0 variant has a high infection vector and attack chain
exhibiting substantial anti-forensic activity.

Attack Overview
LockBit’s new Black variant showed anti-forensic activities which cleared event logs, killed
multiple tasks, and deleted services simultaneously. It obtains initial access to the victim’s
network via SMB brute forcing from various IPs.

The sys-internal tool PSEXEC is used to execute malicious BAT files on a single system
which were later cleaned off. These files indicate activity related to modifying RDP &
authentication settings while disabling antivirus at the same time:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”openrdp.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”mimon.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”auth.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”turnoff.bat” “
PSEXEC is also used to spread laterally across the victim’s network to execute the
ransomware payload. The encryption is done using a multi-threaded approach where only
shared drives got encrypted. The executed payload must have a valid key passed along with
the command-line option ‘-pass.’ The encrypted files are appended with the .zbzdbs59d
extension, which suggests that the builder generates each payload with a random static
string.

Payload Analysis
The ransomware payload is dropped inside the Windows directory, where every variant
requires a unique key to be passed as an argument. This feature was previously known to be
used by other ransomware groups like BlackCat and Egregor. Even if the name of the
payload is changed from ‘Lock.exe’ to anything else or put in any other directory, it does not
run. The pass key used in this case is 60c14e91dc3375e4523be5067ed3b111.
Let us look at a few stages of the payload below:

Decrypting Sections

Fig. 2 – Pseudo code for decrypting PE Sections
The key passed in the argument is taken from the command line and verified. If it passes
verification, this key is further processed to obtain a 1-byte key to decrypt specific sections
obtained by traversing the PEB structure. The three sections decrypted in memory are –
TEXT, DATA, and PDATA.

Resolving Obfuscated APIs
Being packed and having only a few imports, Win32 APIs are resolved by decrypting the
obfuscated string with XOR using the key 0x3A013FD5, which is again unique to each
payload.

Privilege Escalation

3/10

When Admin privileges are not present during execution, it uses CMSTPLUA COM to
bypass the UAC prompt, a legitimate Windows Connection Manager Service. This elevates
the rights from the user to the administrator level with another instance of the ransomware
payload, terminating the current process.

Anti-Debugging Technique
Threads used for file encryption are hidden from the debugger by calling
NtSetInformationThread Win32 API via ThreadInformationClass with an undocumented
value 0x11 that denotes ThreadHideFromDebugger. This hinders dynamic analysis by not
allowing debug information from the current ransomware’s thread to reach the attached
debugger.

Anti-Forensic Activity
As part of wiping out its traces, lots of anti-forensic activity is observed where Windows
Event Logs are disabled by setting multiple registry subkeys to value 0.

Service Deletion and Process Termination
Process terminated included SecurityHealthSystray.exe and the mutex created during
execution was 13fd9a89b0eede26272934728b390e06. Services were enumerated using a

Ransom Note
Before encryption, the ransom note is created in every directory except the Program Files
and the Windows directory, which aren’t encrypted. We can see that they have moved the
naming convention of ransom notes from ‘Restore-My-Files.txt’ to a static string format
“zbzdbs59d.README.txt”.

Fig. 6 – Ransom Note
The ransom note contains instructions to install the TOR browser, links for a chat, and the
personal ID unique to the victim to communicate with the attackers. It also includes the threat
message to leak the stolen data if the ransom amount is not paid and ends with the warnings
as usual. Multiple TOR mirrors for their leak site can be seen in the ransom note, which is
used to reduce redundancy.

File Encryption
Before starting file encryption, a registry key for DefaultIcon is created to associate an icon to
all the encrypted files. Along with this ICO file (zbzdbs59d.ico), a BMP file is also dropped in
the C:\ProgramData directory. Files are encrypted by creating multiple threads where each
filename is replaced with a random string generated and appending the extension to them.
With full encryption completed under 2 minutes it still has the fastest encryption process
since LockBit 2.0.

Changing Wallpaper
Finally, the desktop background (different from 2.0 variant) of the victim machine is changed
with the systemparametersinfoW win32 API, and displays LockBit Black, and instructions to
be followed for decryption.

Conclusion
Unprotected systems in the network were brute-forced to run the PSEXEC tool for lateral
movement across the systems. This was done to execute LockBit’s latest Black ransomware
variant. With LockBit 3.0 introducing its bug bounty program and adopting new extortion
tactics, it is mandatory to take precautions like downloading applications only from trusted
sources, using antivirus for enhanced protection, and avoiding clicking on any links received
through email or social media platforms. As threat actors create their own variants from the
leaked LockBit Black’s builder, proactive measures must be taken to stay protected.
