By now policy makers all over the world identify ransomware as a significant threat to our
digital society. In the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline Attack in May 2021 that caused
widespread gasoline shortages in several US states, ransomware was more discussed than
ever. President Biden recently requested Russian President Putin to crack down on
ransomware operations and the U.S. Department of Justice is elevating investigations of
ransomware attacks to a similar priority as terrorism. This caused panic in the ransomware
underground with some underground forums banning advertisements for ransomware
operations.

The ransomware underground is constantly innovating and finding new ways to operate. One
of these recent innovations is the rise of stolen data marketplaces. Instead of using the
double extortion approach, i.e. encrypting the infrastructure and threatening to release stolen
data, former ransomware gangs shift to data-theft extortion operations only. One reason for
this might be to evade the measures that authorities are now putting in place due to events
like the Colonial Pipeline Attack. Two examples for such marketplaces are Marketo and File
Leaks.
In this blog post, Thomas Barabosch and I will talk about another leak site that Deutsche
Telekom Security recently encountered: LOCKDATA Auction. We will describe what
LOCKDATA Auction is and give insights into a CryLock ransomware case where the CryLock
affiliate worked with this portal. And, of course we provide analysis resources for CryLock
ransomware including YARA rules at our Github repository.
The Incident Response Team at Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH can quickly investigate
and help you remediate ongoing ransomware intrusions. For more information, please

What is LOCKDATA Auction?
LOCKDATA Auction is a Darknet portal that Deutsche Telekom Security is aware of since
May 2021. Figure 1 depicts the main page of LOCKDATA Auction. It appears to offer various
auctions of stolen data from victims worldwide. The country of origin of the victims is always
annotated, e.g. Saudi Arabia or USA. Auctions appear to be open for more than one month
in some cases.
Figure 1: LOCKDATA Auction victim listing.
The registration for auctions is described as invite-only (see Figure 2). Underground
marketplace operators frequently use reputation based or referral systems to better protect
their identities from investigators and shield their communication methods from outsiders.
Figure 2: Registration for auctions is invite-only.
But, to our surprise, when we looked through the page code to learn how invites worked
under the hood, we discovered that the “Sign up” and “Sign in” functions were completely
non-functional.
Usually, when a user tries to log into a webpage, the user’s browser will have to check in with
the server and verify that their credentials are correct. This page doesn’t do that at all - it will
always just display a message like “Error: Login or password entered incorrectly” or “Error:
Wrong invite code!” immediately when “Sign in” or “Sign up” is clicked.

So, what does this mean? Most likely, since the portal is fairly new, functionality might still be
in development. Another hypothesis is that the site merely serves as a menacing mockup of
an online auction site, to coerce victims into paying the ransom. During our investigation, we
have observed a ransomware operator change victim information on the auction site on the
fly, which proves they have direct access to LOCKDATA Auction.
Auctions have a start price (ranging from $50 000 to $500 000), a minimum deposit (ranging
from $0 to $50 000 dollars), and a blitz price (up to $1 500 000). The website shows the top
bet for active auctions as well. In some cases, the top bet is less than the starting price.
There is a link to preview data, which however was broken in most cases (as of time of
writing). The descriptions of the victims and data sets is comprehensive. Data set sizes
range from 50 GB to 2 TB. Figure 3 shows an example of an active auction.

Successfully concluded auctions are still listed on the website. Their download link is
“locked” but there is still a button to contact the seller. Figure 4 depicts an example of a
finished auction. In this case, supposedly $40 000 were paid for 2 terabytes of personal data
of a North American public entity.

Who offers leaks on LOCKDATA Auction?
Deutsche Telekom Security was involved in a LOCKDATA Auction case. In this occasion, the
threat actor utilized the CryLock ransomware to encrypt the victim’s environment.
CryLock is a ransomware from the Russian cybercrime underground. It follows a
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, where “partners” (or “affiliates”) acquire the
ransomware to deploy it in victim environments. The first reference to this ransomware was
in 2014. Back then, it was publicly known as Crykal. A take-down of its infrastructure took
place in 2018, resulting in a decryptor being published. In 2020, Crykal was rebranded under
the name CryLock.
CryLock is written in Delphi, so obfuscations are nearly non-existent. There is a check
whether or not the victim is located in a CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) country,
which is a common check for malware families from Russia and other CIS states. The
ransomware encrypts files using a combination of RSA and a custom symmetric algorithm.
After encryption, it drops a file called “how_to_decrypt.hta” as seen in Figure 5. The key
takeaway is that the victim must contact the ransomware affiliate using the provided email
address and a unique victim ID. This is the general course of action that CryLock affiliates
follow.

Figure 6: how_to_decrypt.hta shows information to the victim.
However, in this particular case the modus operandi was slightly different. We observed how
the threat actor utilized a Batch file to also add a legal notice to show on startup of the
encrypted systems. This legal notice stated the following:
“Your system has been tested for security by the CryLOCK Ramsoware team and has failed.
We specialize in file encryption and are also involved in industrial (also economic or
corporate) espionage. We don't care about your files and what you do, nothing personal - it's
just business. We recommend contacting us, as your confidential files have been stolen and
will be sold to interested people if you do not pay for their removal or decryption of the files.
One of the email for communication: [REDACTED]@[REDACTED].com Do not use
corporate email for communication, in most cases your letters will not reach us. Our auction
of information and confidential files, hosted in Tor [REDACTED].onion or
http://[REDACTED].”
In their notice, the threat actor refers to the “CryLOCK Ramsoware [sic] team”. In addition to
the aforementioned email address for communication purposes, they also provide the link to
LOCKDATA Auction.

“Search Keys” Utility
The notice also contained an additional (shortened) Internet link. This link resolved to a cloud
hosting provider (see Figure 7), where the “Search_keys_CryLOCK_3.0.exe” tool could be
downloaded.
The page also contained a wallpaper of a part of the legal notice quoted above. Again, the
same typo can be seen here. At this point, we are not sure whether this is an unintended
typo or a stylization of the word “ransomware”. There were several communication channels
mentioned: two email addresses and the TOR link to LOCKDATA Auction. One email
address refers to CryLock and one to the auctioneer who was responsible for the auction on
LOCKDATA Auction.

The tool “Search_keys_CryLOCK_3.0.exe” (see Figure 7) itself is rather interesting. This
Delphi 7 utility can scan local disks as well as network storage for files that CryLock
encrypted. It supposedly will also identify which generation of encryption mode was used on
the files. Furthermore, it can kill CryLock related processes (e.g. mshta.exe, which shows the
ransom note).

Access Brokering
Nowadays, ransomware is teamwork. Administrator access to systems is gained and sold by
specialized hackers, sometimes for as low as $10. When an access path changes hands, we
typically observe a change in the way the attack is carried out.
In this case, we discovered that the initial compromise of the victim’s environment had been
supported by a very distinct set of attacker infrastructure, tools, and mannerisms. The exact
same behavior was observed in an entirely different case that occurred around the same
time, but where another RaaS was used. This indicates that the actor using those tools may
breach different victims and then either trade the access to one or more other group(s) or
deploy different last stage payloads themselves.

Conclusion
LOCKDATA Auction is a new player in the field of darknet marketplaces. At this time, the site
lacks basic functionality one would expect from an online auction site but is likely to grow
over time.
At this point, it is not 100% clear whether LOCKDATA Auction is exclusive to CryLock
affiliates or open to other ransomware operations as well, even though the similarity in
branding between CryLock and LOCKDATA is striking. The attackers state with typos that
the CryLock ransomware team attacked a victim’s environment, which may suggest a group
of people working together more closely than in a typical RaaS affiliate model. On the other
side, the link to LOCKDATA Auction was not directly provided in the ransom note. It was
shown to the victim only through a pre-login “legal notice” in Windows. Also, separate email
addresses are listed for communication: one CryLock-related and one for the auctioneer at
LOCKDATA Auction.
The ransomware landscape is innovating at a fast pace. Reactions of nation-states due to
recent events like the Colonial Pipeline Attack in May 2021 are just increasing the velocity.
One recent trend are stolen data (or leak) marketplaces like LOCKDATA Auction. These
marketplaces offer threat actors a way to publish and monetize stolen data as leverage for
their data-theft extortions.
