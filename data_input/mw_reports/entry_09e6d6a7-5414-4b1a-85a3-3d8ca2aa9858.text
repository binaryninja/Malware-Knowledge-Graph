TTPs Associated With a New Version of the BlackCat Ransomware
Vlad Pasca, Senior Malware & Threat Analyst
Posted on September 6th, 2022

Executive summary
The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware is a complex threat written in Rust that appeared in
November 2021. In this post, we describe a real engagement that we recently handled by
giving details about the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat actor.
Firstly, the attacker targeted an unpatched Microsoft Exchange server and successfully
dropped webshells on the machine. After getting initial access, the ransomware installed the
MobaXterm software and then started to dump the credentials using Mimikatz or by creating
an LSASS dump file with Process Hacker. The SoftPerfect Network scanner was used to
perform network discovery. Before running the ransomware executable, the TA compressed
the targeted files using WinRAR or 7zip and then exfiltrated them using rclone and
MEGAsync.

Our Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) team was engaged in investigating a
ransomware infection. We were able to determine that the ransomware involved is a new
version of the BlackCat ransomware, based on the fact that the malware added new
command line parameters that were not documented before.
As shown in Figure 1, the ransomware added a parameter called “--safeboot” that is used to
reboot in Safe Mode. Whether the malware is running with the “--sleep-restart” parameter,
the process sleeps for a specified number of seconds and then restarts the machine.

A complete analysis of the BlackCat ransomware can be found here.
By accessing the onion link specified in the ransom note called “RECOVER-<extension>FILES.txt”, the victim is presented with multiple tabs that contain information such as the
ransom amount in Bitcoin and Monero, the threat actor’s wallets addresses, a live chat, and
a trial decrypt that can be used to decrypt a few files for free (see Figure 2).

Initial access
According to our analysis, the entry point in the organization was an Exchange server that
was vulnerable to Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. Multiple webshells have been identified
on the impacted server.

Remote access tools
After gaining access to the internal network, the ransomware installed the legitimate tools
MobaXterm and mottynew.exe (MobaXterm terminal).

Lateral Movement
As we already know from the malware analysis of the ransomware, BlackCat steals
credentials from the victim’s environment and incorporates them into its configuration
(“credentials” field). Mimikatz was utilized to dump the credentials, and then the malware
pivots from one machine to another via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

An old version of the SoftPerfect Network scanner was used to perform network scanning in
order to discover additional targets in the local network. Figure 3 reveals the interface of the
network scanner:

Data exfiltration
Once the threat actor decided which files to exfiltrate, the malware compressed them using
WinRAR or 7zip. The ransomware installed a tool called rclone that is utilized to upload data
to cloud storage providers. A second tool called MEGAsync is also installed by the process,
which can upload data to the MEGA Cloud Storage.
We’ve also observed the ransomware installing tools such as FileZilla and WinSCP that
could be used to perform data exfiltration.

Other tools installed
We’ve investigated and found out that the ransomware installed the cURL tool to download
additional files. Process Hacker was also installed by the malware and could be used to
dump the memory of the LSASS process. In the same directory with Process Hacker, the
BlackCat ransomware dropped a copy of the PEView tool, which is a viewer for Portable
Executable (PE) files.

Conclusion
BlackCat ransomware remains a serious threat because it targets Windows hosts, Linux
hosts, and VMWare ESXi. The access token that the malware is running with makes the
automated analysis impossible and increases the difficulty of the dynamic malware analysis.
4/5

The usage of legitimate tools to perform malicious activities increases the chance of not
being detected by endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software.
