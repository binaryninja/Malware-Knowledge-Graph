Preface
Over the past couple of weeks, cybersecurity vendors [1, 2, 4] have announced the uncovering
of a successful cyberespionage campaign carried out by the Dragon y hacking group. In the
most recent string of attacks, Dragon y has targeted multiple US and European energy
companies, successfully looting valuable process information in what appears to be the next
step in the cyberwarfare campaign against critical infrastructure organizations, after Stuxnet
in 2010. Cybersecurity vendors have scrutinized the campaign and presented an analysis of the
malware employed by Dragon y to steal information from the infected computers. This short
paper revisits the main points of this investigation and illustrates why the implementation of
a defense-in-depth strategy is key to successfully counter cyberthreats like Dragon y.

The Dragon y cyberespionage
campaign
The Dragon y hacker group has successfully mounted a cyberespionage operation against
US and European companies, mainly in the energy sector. The group managed to install a
remote access tool (RAT) in computers used for running Industrial Control Systems (ICS),
and to harvest data from the infected machines utilizing a payload designed for a speci c
industrial protocol. According to Symantec [1], the Dragon y campaign appears to have
a much broader focus than the preceding Stuxnet campaign: \While Stuxnet was narrowly
targeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal, Dragon y
appears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current
objective with sabotage as an optional capability if required." There has been no proof that
any sabotage capabilities were used by the Dragon y group to date, but capabilities may exist
in the toolkits employed, representing possibly the scariest part of the story, as they could
potentially open doors to dramatic scenarios. Was the stealing of industrial information from
energy companies only the rst step of a destructive cyberwarfare campaign?

The attacker
The Dragon y hacker group (also known as Energetic Bear) appears to be in operation since
2011. It initially targeted organizations in the defense and aviation industries in US and
Canada, before moving their attention to US and Western European energy rms in 2013.
An analysis of the malware code used in the campaign has shown that the group worked mostly
during Eastern European working hours (Monday through Friday from 9AM to 6PM, UTC+4
time zone), suggesting that most group members worked in that region. The complexity of
the operation leads many to believe that Dragon y is a well-funded, possibly state-sponsored
group of adversaries.

The targets
So far, the campaign has resulted in the leakage of information from multiple organizations,
many of which operate in the energy sector, and range from electricity generation companies, electricity grid and petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial system and equipment
providers. The majority of the victims are located in Europe, followed by the US. Figure 1
shows the top 10 countries by active infections (i.e. where the attacker has extracted information from infected computers).

Figure 1: Top 10 countries by active infections [1]
In total, the number of infected machines that attempted to report to a malware command
and control (C&C) server is approximately 1500 [2]. These numbers represent hosts that have
been compromised and have established C&C communications, which does not necessarily
represent the number of actual industrial control system hosts compromised (this will be
discussed in more detail later in this paper). Precise information about the extent of the ICS
compromise is not available at the time of writing, but is expected to be signi cantly less
than shown in the reported chart.

Attack vectors
Dragon y used two pieces of malware in the attack; both were remote access tools (RATs)
designed to carry out the cyberespionage operations. The RATs were distributed and reached
the victims' machines through three attack vectors:

 E-mail campaign: selected executives and senior employees of targeted companies

would receive e-mails with a malicious PDF attachment containing the RAT. Symantec
identi ed seven di erent organizations targeted in this campaign; the number of emails
sent to each organization ranged from 1 to 84 [1].

 Watering hole attacks: these attacks targeted a number of legitimate websites likely
to be visited by individuals working in the energy sector. Upon visiting one of the
infected websites, the visitor would be redirected to another compromised legitimate
website hosting an exploit kit. This exploit kit would in turn install the RAT on the
visitor's computer.

 Software downloaded from ICS related vendors: Dragon y members managed to

hack the websites of at least three di erent ICS related vendors, and insert malware

c

into the legitimate software they were making available for download to their clients.
The malware would then be installed on the victim's computer upon download of the
trusted software or update. The targeted vendors are based in Germany, Switzerland,
and Belgium. The rst identi ed software package to be Trojanized was used to provide
VPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC) and similar devices. The second
company manufactures a PLC type device, and had one of their communication drivers
Trojanized. The third company included in this campaign develops ICS systems for
primarily renewable energy markets.
Dragon y employed these attack vectors in three successive phases of the campaign. The
e-mail attacks were conducted between February and June 2013; they were followed by the
watering hole attacks beginning in June 2013 that included the compromise of ICS vendor
websites. The rst ICS vendor website was compromised for a period of six weeks during the
period of June-July 2013, followed by the second vendor in January 2014. This second vendor
was able to identify the breach, notify a ected users and mitigate the situation in about 10
days. It is estimated that around 250 downloads of the infected software occurred during this
phase [3]. The nal ICS vendor website breach occurred in April 2014 and lasted two weeks.

Malware operation
The attackers employed two RATs to steal information from the infected computers and
send it to C&C servers under the control of the attackers. Both of these RATs provided the
capability of downloading and executing les remotely via the C&C servers:

 The Havex RAT (also known as Backdoor.Oldrea): it allows the attacker to extract

data from the Outlook address book and ICS related software con guration les used
for remote access from the infected computer to other industrial systems. Furthermore,
it gathers system information on the installed programs, local le lists, and available
drives.

 Karagany (Trojan.Karagany): it allows the attackers to upload and download les
from the infected computer and to run executable les. It also contains advanced
features for collecting passwords, taking screenshots, and cataloguing documents stored
on the victim's machine. Karagany was already available on the underground market,
although the Dragon y group might have modi ed the source code to best ts its
purposes.

Most of the victims were infected with the Havex RAT; Karagany was identi ed on only
5% of the infected computers. Havex appears to be custom malware either written by the
Dragon y group itself or commissioned by them. Security analysts of F-Secure [2] have identi ed and analyzed 88 variants of Havex, which contacted 146 C&C servers to communicate
the stolen information. The majority of the C&C servers host blogs and content management systems (primarily WordPress ), presumably compromised by the attackers using similar
exploits. These numbers strengthen the belief that the operation is state-sponsored.
From an operational viewpoint, certain payloads deployed with the Havex RAT exhibit
\ICS network sning" behavior. In particular, they attempt to enumerate and qualify the
devices in the local area network, and send the results back to the C&C servers. An analysis of
the malware executables highlights that the attackers were looking for OPC (Open Platform
Communications ) servers. OPC is a real-time data exchange protocol that supports bidirectional reading/writing of process variables, but does not provide more advanced capabilities

2 OPC was renamed from \Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control" to \Open Platform

Communications" in November 2011.

like device con guration and rmware updates. OPC is a standard way for process control
systems, applications and devices to interact with each other.
It is important to note that not all variants of the Havex RAT and its associated payloads
contained the code used to enumerate OPC services on a network. The observed payloads
containing the ICS (OPC) components are believed to have originated only via the Trojanized
software downloads from the three mentioned ICS vendor websites. This conclusion is based
on analysis of malware referenced by F-Secure [2] and obtained through VirusTotal . This
means that the actual number of compromised ICS systems is likely much less than the
identi ed number of hosts/sites infected by the Havex malware along.
Figures 2 and 3 shows the relevant extract of the Havex payload containing the network
and OPC enumeration code. Looking at the malware code, we can indeed see that it uses
Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) interfaces to detect whether the machines identi ed during the network scan run OPC services. The two COM interfaces found in the code
are the following:
3

 IOPCServerList (CLSID = 13486D51-4821-11D2-A494-3CB306C10000)
 IOPCServerList2 (IID = 9DD0B56C-AD9E-43EE-8305-487F3188BF7A)

Figure 2: Extract from Havex Executable (taken from samples obtained from VirusTotal)

Figure 3: Extract from Havex Strings (taken from samples obtained from VirusTotal)
The fact that Dragon y is gathering information about OPC servers and VPN connections
to PLCs might indicate that the nal objective is to gain access to the PLCs themselves,
which would enable the attackers to change, damage or disrupt the critical processes run by
the targeted organizations.

SilentDefense detects the malware
used by Dragon y
SecurityMatters' agship product SilentDefense ICS is capable of detecting Havex in multiple
stages of its operation, immediately alerting the security team of the threat and enabling
the targeted victim to mitigate it before damage is done or sensitive information is disclosed.
In particular, SilentDefense ICS detects Havex both when it attempts to connect to the
C&C server to download or upload les and information, and when it scans the network to
enumerate devices. In the next paragraphs we illustrate how SilentDefense ICS would detect
and alert about the Havex behavior.

The network Behavioral Blueprint
SilentDefense ICS is a network monitoring and intrusion detection system that automatically
models normal and acceptable network behavior and alerts whenever some network devices
perform activities that diverge from their intended operation. SilentDefense ICS operates in
two phases. First, it analyzes network communications and generates the network Behavioral
Blueprint . The Behavioral Blueprint de nes communication patterns, protocols, message
types, message elds, and eld values that are normal for the monitored process. A review
of the Behavioral Blueprint immediately reveals network and system miscon guration (e.g.,
rogue devices), unintended communications, and unusual eld values employed in the network,
in case Havex already infected some devices. After this setup phase, SilentDefense ICS can
be used for continuous monitoring to detect whenever network devices perform unintended
activities. In the case of Havex, these unintended activities are represented by the network
scan and the communication with the C&C servers.
Figures 4 and 5 show some examples of network Behavioral Blueprints as displayed by
SilentDefense ICS. The examples represent the two \types" of Behavioral Blueprint that
SilentDefense ICS can generate. In particular, Figure 4 shows the model of normal network
communications automatically generated by SilentDefense ICS' LAN Communication Pro le
(LAN CP) engine. The LAN CP reports the observed network communications in terms of
TM

c

communication patterns, protocols, and protocol message types normally used by the devices
in the network. Note that this includes details of which device has communicated using which
(D)COM interfaces. The controls implemented by the LAN CP make sure that whenever a
network device connects to an unusual IP address (e.g., the C&C server), or invokes a COM
interface that it has never used before or is not supposed to be used (e.g., the ones used by
Havex), SilentDefense ICS raises an alert.

Figure 4: An example of LAN Communication Pro ler Behavioral Blueprint
Figure 5 shows the model of normal protocol usage automatically generated by SilentDefense ICS' Deep Protocol Behavior Inspection (DPBI) engine. This model presents all elds
(e.g. message types) and eld values that are normally used for a certain protocol within
the analysed network in the form of a protocol tree. The depicted tree was built for the
DCOM protocol. On the right of the tree, we show how for each protocol eld it is possible
to observe in detail and edit the values observed. Again, the DPBI engine guarantees that if
network devices use unusual (D)COM elds, the security team will immediately be alerted.

Figure 5: An example of Deep Protocol Behavioral Inspection Behavioral Blueprint

Detection of network scan
SilentDefense ICS can detect Havex through both LAN CP and DPBI engines. More precisely,
the LAN CP might raise an alert for two types of unusual network activities. The rst is the
network scan performed by the infected machine (see Figure 3). In fact, when scanning
the network, the infected machine might connect to devices with which it normally does
not communicate, or is not supposed to communicate. The second unusual activity is the
invocation of the IOPCServer COM interfaces. These interfaces are typically used only when
ICS software is installed or updated on a certain device; at SecurityMatters' customers, we
have never observed the use of these interfaces during normal operations. Their invocation

c

would thus result in alert being generated by SilentDefense ICS. If the invocation of these
interfaces is followed by a communication with an unknown external IP address (e.g. the
C&C server - as described in the following section), the host originating the communication
is likely to be infected by Havex.
Figure 6 shows an example of an alert generated by the LAN CP when it detects the
use of unusual COM interfaces. The unusual interfaces are indicated on the right: they are
highlighted in red and marked with a warning sign. On the left, the alert reports details of the
devices involved in the communication. This allows to immediately spot any devices infected
by Havex (the \source" device).

Figure 6: Alert generated by SilentDefense ICS when Havex invokes the COM interfaces to
identify OPC servers
Similarly, the DPBI engine would detect and report the use of unusual COM protocol
elds (and/or values) by any infected device. The alert generated by the DPBI engine would
indicate the \source" of the unusual communication, thus identifying the infected machine,
and the branch of the protocol tree that is not part of normal operations.

Detection of communication with C&C server
Further to detecting the network scan, SilentDefense ICS' LAN CP engine would alert the
security team also whenever the infected machine attempts to communicate with the malware C&C server. In fact, the infected machine would connect to an IP address that is not
\whitelisted" in the LAN CP model. This enables the security team to stop the communication before any sensitive network information is leaked, for instance by \blacklisting" the
C&C IP in the company rewall.
Figure 7 illustrates an example alert generated by the LAN CP engine when a network
device contacts an unusual IP address. The alert highlights in red and marks with a warning
the unusual IP address, which can be immediately blacklisted if not recognized by the security
team. Figure 7 illustrates an example alert generated by the LAN CP engine when a network
device contacts an unusual IP address. The alert highlights in red and marks with a warning
the unusual IP address, which can be immediately blacklisted if not recognized by the security
team.

Conclusions and recommendations
The Dragon y hacker group is carrying out a cyberespionage campaign against energy companies in the US and Europe. So far, the campaign has resulted in the successful looting of
strategic information from the energy companies' networks. The malware employed in the
campaign, however, may give the attackers the capability to launch subsequent attacks with
greater consequences.
It is fundamental that critical infrastructure organizations start adopting more progressive
countermeasures to today's cyberthreats. The waiting time is over - it has been demonstrated
more than once that skillful attackers can easily penetrate critical infrastructure networks, with
the potential of causing immeasurable damages to the economy, security, and public safety
and health of a country.
We believe that the implementation of a defense-in-depth strategy is key to successfully
counter the increasing cyberthreat. The rst defensive layer is of course represented by
rewalls and/or intrusion prevention systems, which keep out of a network the known and easyto-spot attacks. Cybersecurity vendors have already released signatures for their intrusion
prevention and host-based solutions to detect and stop the malware used by Dragon y. As
indicated by F-Secure, however, 88 variants of the Havex malware have been identi ed so
far. Signatures might not o er protection to new variants released by Dragon y, or to the
next malware employed in their campaign. It is therefore vital that along with traditional
cybersecurity solutions enterprises deploy a non-signature based network monitoring solution
like SilentDefense ICS, which does not rely on the knowledge of a threat to detect it and report
it. SilentDefense ICS is unique in its kind, as no other solution is capable of automatically
de ning \normal network operations", and of analysing communications down to the values
exchanged by network devices. This unique approach ensures protection from today's as well
as tomorrow's threats.
