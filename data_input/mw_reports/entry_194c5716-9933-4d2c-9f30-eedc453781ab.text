A new Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS, called Satan has been discovered by security
researcher Xylitol. This service allows any wannabe criminal to register an account and
create their very own customized version of the Satan Ransomware.
Once the ransomware is created, it is then up to the criminal to determine how they will
distribute the ransomware, while the RaaS will handle the ransom payments and adding new
features. For this service, the RaaS developer takes a 30% cut of any payments that are made
by victims. According to the advertisement for the Satan RaaS, the developer will reduce
their cut depending on the volume of payments received by an affiliate.

The Satan RaaS
When a person first goes to the Satan RaaS they will be greeted with a home page that
describes what the service is and how a criminal can make money with it.

Satan RaaS Home Page

Once a user registers an account and logs in, they will be greeted with an affiliate console that
contains various pages that they can use to help distribute their ransomware. These pages are
the Malwares, Droppers, Translate, Account, Notices, and Messages pages.
The first page that is shown when someone logs in is the Malwares page, which allows a
criminal to configure various settings of their very customized version of the Satan
Ransomware. In terms of customization, there is not really many options. A user can specify
the ransom amount, how much it goes up after a certain amount of the days, and the amount
of days that the ransom payment should increase.

Satan RaaS Ransomware Generation Page

The Droppers page, shown below, provides code that assists the affiliate in creating
malicious Microsoft Word macros or CHM installers. These can then be used by the affiliate
to distribute the ransomware via SPAM or other means.
This the first time I have seen a public RaaS like this offer tips and help to the affiliates when
it comes to distribution methods. This type of hand holding could allow a curious affiliate to
become an active one.

Satan RaaS Droppers Page

The Translate page allows affiliates to expand the languages used by Satan for the ransom
notes.

Satan RaaS Translation Page

The Account page is where the affiliate can see the amount of people infected, the amount
paid, and other information.

Satan RaaS Account Information Page

Finally there is a Notices page, which will be used to display messages from the RaaS
developer, and a Messages page that can be used for "customer service" requests.

As for the Satan Ransomware Itself...
When the Satan Ransomware is installed it will check to see if it is running under a virtual
machine, and if it is, will terminate. Once executed it will inject itself into TaskHost.exe and
begin to encrypt the data on the computer. It is currently unknown what encryption
algorithm Satan uses, but it will target files with the following extensions:

When it has encrypted a file, it will scramble its name and append the .stn extension to the
file. For example, test.jpg may become ahasd.stn. While encrypting files it will also create a
ransom note called HELP_DECRYPT_FILES.html in each folder that a file has been
encrypted.
When it has finished encrypting the computer, it will execute the
C:\Windows\System32\cipher.exe" /W:C command to wipe all data from the unused
space on the C: Drive.
Finally it will display the ransom note, which contains a unique victim ID and a URL to a
TOR payment site.

When a victim clicks on one of the enclosed URLs they will be brought to Satan's payment
site where they can get payment instructions.

Looks cool, it's well made and it's a good idea.
I hope this works out for them and they make a lot of money.

You must be kidding, right? Even more ransomware? No, thanks. And I wish you
become a victim yourself, so we can see if you find it that funny afterwards ¬¬

Its really sad that ransomware has become such an effective tool for criminals
considering that its super easy to defeat. all you need is an external hot swap bay and a
schedule to rotate out your backup drives so you always have a up to date copy of your
drive images offline heck even the most computer illiterate person can subscribe to and
configure cloud storage through most commercially available backup software.
