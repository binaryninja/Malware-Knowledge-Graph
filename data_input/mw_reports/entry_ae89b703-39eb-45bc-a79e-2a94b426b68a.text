Following the ransomware incident impacting Colonial Pipeline operations in May 2021,
many parties asked how such a disruption, impacting one of the main arteries delivering
refined petroleum products to the Eastern and Southeastern United States, could occur.
Based on information available, the intrusion did not directly impact Industrial Control
Systems (ICS) within Colonial’s environment. Instead, the company itself initiated a
controlled shutdown of operations as a precautionary matter to prevent critical ICS-related
and product tracking or billing systems from being impacted by the ransomware event. Yet
even though the criminal entities responsible did not or were unable to directly modify,
disable, or otherwise disrupt ICS equipment, Colonial operators and defenders believed
there was a non-zero chance such action could take place.

Based on the above circumstances, many persons asked a seemingly simple question: why
were critical control system devices even accessible from Colonial’s IT network in the first
place, resulting in the precautionary shutdown? This question brings ICS-related security
back to the discussion of the “air gap.” Frequently lauded as an impenetrable standard in
securing sensitive networks but nearly always misunderstood, an air gap – physical
separation and lack of any connectivity between the sensitive network and all other networks
– provides a deceptively easy solution for network defense. Yet further exploration of just
what an air gap entails and how to actually implement one rapidly demonstrates that,
although applicable in certain situations, as a general security practice (even in critical
infrastructure environments) this practice rapidly becomes untenable.
First, what is an air gap? As described briefly above, an air gap represents the complete,
physical isolation of a given network from all other networks. Only through physically bridging
the network, such as through the introduction of removable media, can data flow in or out of
the network in question. While not completely secure, as there are multiple known instances
of self-propagating or air gap-jumping intrusions going back nearly two decades, such
absolute segmentation will defeat the vast majority of network intrusions by virtue of simply
not having an accessible network in place. Yet as tantalizing as this seems, actual, true “air
gapped” networks are exceedingly rare, and frequently contain links, whether intentional via
diodes or unintentional via “shadow IT,” that make cross-domain traffic possible.

For example, there is an assumption that classified networks, such as those used by US
military and intelligence communities, are air gapped from the wider internet. Yet if we think
of the definition of air gap – complete, physical segmentation – it rapidly becomes clear that
this is simply not possible. Short of building a completely separate system of communication
links (fiber, undersea cables, etc.) and avoiding all “over the air” transmission (satellite
communications, wireless, etc.), the systems cannot be air gapped. Given that the US
government does not operate a completely parallel internet, traffic from these networks “comingles” on public lines. While the traffic may be secured, and ingress and egress to on-site
networks controlled via security solutions and diodes, traffic does exist and “cross-domain”
traffic is possible, even if exceedingly difficult to achieve.
The problem with the above scenario, and what prevents the creation of an actual air gap for
sensitive networks, is the distributed nature of the organizations involved. In order to enable
not just networking within CIA headquarters or the Pentagon, but to extend such
communication (including sensitive communication) to ships at sea and Forward Operating
Bases (FOBs) in Afghanistan, connectivity outside a plausible, possible air gap environment
must exist. Even something as seemingly isolated as a submarine still has connectivity to a
network – via VLF signals while deeply submerged and via various over-the-air signals
(connecting to various networks, tactical or otherwise) when surfaced or floating a
communications buoy.

However, some environments exist where true air gaps are not only plausible, but actually
required. The standard example is reactor control for nuclear power generation. While other
elements of nuclear power stations, such as those items directly interfacing with the overall
electric system, will be networked (for reasons we’ll explore shortly), reactor control systems
are required to be isolated in nearly all countries that operate such facilities. Combined with
significant passive engineering safety controls, the actual reactor environment is designed to
be operated as a completely isolated system, with strict measures in place for the
introduction of outside material (e.g., software updates). Yet this environment represents
something that the overall US military network is not: a single, centralized, specialized
environment that can meaningfully be isolated from other systems. So long as heat can be
exchanged and steam generated (indirectly, as in the pressurized water reactor), the reactor
can “communicate” all that it needs to drive turbines and generate electricity with no further
intervention needed.
What about pipelines, such as Colonial? To understand why an air gap is nonsensical in this
case, we need to understand that a pipeline consists of multiple, communicating components
which must work together as a system to enable monitored, safe, reliable operations. The
combination of pipeline collection, gate station, and compressor station components must
communicate to a control center to govern the entire system, with sensor data and other
feeds enabling visibility into operations. For a commercial pipeline that is thousands of miles
long with hundreds of such facilities, an “air gapped network” is simply implausible, and if
implemented would likely introduce sufficient operational friction and delay as to make
operations less efficient and potentially even less safe. Short of building an entirely selfcontained, geographically distributed network for the pipeline, a true air gap is at minimum
prohibitively expensive. When combined with the need to communicate with suppliers and
customers at machine speeds during product transfer and delivery, the air gap would need to
be extended even further to up- and down-stream environments. In short, aside from building
a completely separate, dedicated internet covering the entire oil and gas sector, along with
substantial portions of electric generation, it is simply infeasible to implement a true air gap in
pipeline (and related) environments.
One key aspect of this discussion is that critical infrastructure systems are rarely single point,
isolated items in physical and network space. Like the pipeline and defense network
examples above, the electric system (or “grid”) is similar in that it consists of multiple,
interlocking and interdependent components from generation to transmission to distribution
to function properly. Monitoring and communication at machine speeds enable for rapid
responses and corrections to worrying or damaging conditions such as frequency or phase
anomalies that may imperil synchronization, or the disruptions created through interruptions
in any part of the system. While it is possible to run such systems through pure physical
controls, with fully manned substations and legacy electromechanical relays among other
items, such operations are significantly less efficient, more expensive, and in most situations
less safe than a modern Energy Management System (EMS) remotely coordinating multiple
elements of physical grid operations with safety and protection provided by digital protective
4/5

relays. As with the other examples, the only way to “air gap” this network would be to build
an entire dedicated network encompassing the entire electric system, from the largest
publicly listed utility company to the smallest local distribution cooperative.
While air gaps are largely irrelevant, impossible, and even undesirable in many instances,
we must recognize that connectivity and utilizing common infrastructure for communications
still poses risks. Vocal proponents of air gap implementation will use a false dichotomy to
argue their point, attempting to convince those with less knowledge of these systems that
circumstances resemble an “all or nothing” proposition between complete connectivity and
complete isolation. Yet this is ridiculous and hardly representative of reality. As discussed
with the military and intelligence network situation, you can have (reasonably) secure
communications with a FOB in Central Asia from suburban DC provided the link and its
components are properly established.
While a pipeline operator or water utility may not require that extreme level of security seen
in protecting JWICS or other networks, relatively simple and widely available solutions can at
least work to ensure attackers cannot hit Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) directly
from the internet, and limit exposure in cases like the Colonial event. Short of deploying
diodes and similar technology, robust network segmentation and authentication schema,
such as use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
combined with fundamental Network Security Monitoring (NSM) will yield profound
improvements in communication design.
The problem is not that PLCs and related equipment are accessible, it is that they are trivially
accessible in many instances, such as the various intrusions into water treatment facilities in
the US and Israel over the past year. That critical infrastructure devices can be enumerated
via Shodan and directly accessed over the internet or from corporate IT networks is not a
sign that such devices need to be air gapped. Rather it is evidence that such networks must
be better designed and introduce improved controls. Once adversaries demonstrate the
ability to consistently and easily subvert properly deployed VPNs and robust MFA
implementation, then we as defenders and asset operators can talk about more robust
solutions. Even then, something approaching the military model, of secure and encrypted
communications tunneled over public networks, will likely be preferable than a true air gap
solution necessitating the construction of a dedicated critical infrastructure network spanning
continents.
Overall, critical infrastructure security has problems, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware
incident shows what several of them look like. But instead of immediately clamoring for an
absolutist remedy that would be prohibitively difficult (and likely impossible) to implement, we
as defenders and decision-makers should instead consider solutions closer-to-hand first. By
applying fairly standard controls and network design principles, many of the supposed
benefits of air gapped installations can be realized while also retaining the significant benefits
of connectivity and communication over existing network infrastructure.
