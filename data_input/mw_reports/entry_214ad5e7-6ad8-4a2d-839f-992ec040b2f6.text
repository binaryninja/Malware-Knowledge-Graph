Introduction
Security, IT, and other teams tasked with vulnerability management and risk reduction
frequently operate in high-urgency, high-stakes environments where informed decisionmaking hinges on the ability to quickly separate signal from a sea of perpetual noise. When a
new potential threat emerges, information security professionals often find themselves
needing to translate vague descriptions and untested research artifacts into actionable
intelligence for their own particular risk models.

1/51

Rapid7 researchers analyze thousands of vulnerabilities each year to understand root
causes, dispel misconceptions, and share information on why certain flaws are more likely to
be exploited than others. This report examines 50 vulnerabilities from the 2020 calendar year
in order to highlight exploitation trends, explore attacker use cases, and offer a framework for
understanding new security threats as they arise. Our aim is to contextualize the
vulnerabilities that introduce serious risk to a wide range of organizations—and those that
probably don’t. We have also included a practical applications section with guidance for
defenders.
This is not a threat intelligence report, though we do make use of cyber threat intelligence
(CTI) terminology within it. There are many fine purveyors of threat intelligence who do a
first-rate job of mapping motives and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to specific
threat actors. Traditional CTI methodologies and elements, including artifacts like indicators
of compromise (IOCs), are outside the scope of this paper.
There is a substantial amount of data incorporated into the sections below, including a
number of overarching metadata types Rapid7 researchers have defined and normalized. It’s
all important, but don’t let it fool you: This is very much a report about instinct—the hunches
that drive security researchers and exploit developers—with a dash of history to boot.

Executive Summary
The volume of published vulnerabilities has grown significantly over the past five years. 2017
experienced a 127% increase in CVE-named vulnerabilities over 2016, and each year of
CVEs since then has topped its predecessor in sheer volume. By the time the year came to a
close, 2020 racked up 18,362 vulnerabilities, which represented a 6% increase over 2019
and a dizzying 185% rise from five years ago. December 2020’s revelations about nation
state-backed campaigns that compromised more than half a dozen U.S. government
agencies and thousands of organizations globally capped a turbulent year of high-priority
security flaws, some of the most severe of which occurred in internet-facing technologies
critical to protecting a newly remote workforce.
Of course, not all of 2020’s security flaws stood shoulder to shoulder—even those given
perfect 10 severity scores.
We look at 50 distinct CVEs in this report: 30 of these vulnerabilities were exploited in the
wild in 2020, either broadly in indiscriminate attacks or in smaller-scale, targeted attacks. The
remaining 20 vulnerabilities are not known to be actively exploited and are classified as
impending threats because of their value to attackers, the discoverability of technical details,
and/or the general availability of exploit code. Of course, the absence of evidence doesn’t
mean these vulnerabilities haven’t been exploited—only that no exploitation has been
publicly disclosed.
2020 findings include:
2/51

In this report, we examine 14 vulnerabilities that became widespread threats and
posed substantial risks to organizations of all sizes in 2020. You will undoubtedly
recognize many of these widely exploited vulnerabilities, which include WebLogic
Server and ManageEngine zero-days in addition to the likes of RECON and Zerologon.
The 14 CVEs in our widespread threat list were exploited by a wide range of malicious
parties, from state-sponsored threat actors to run-of-the-mill “commodity” attackers.
Critical vulnerabilities featured prominently in security news headlines in 2020,
but some flaws were much more exploitable than others. Deserialization and
improper access control vulnerabilities were the root cause of some of the most
widespread threats of 2020, accounting for 78% of CVEs in our dataset that were
exploited at scale.
Some of 2020’s most high-impact vulnerabilities occurred in security products
that sat in critical and often exposed places in organizations’ networks. Nine of
the vulnerabilities we examine in this report functioned as network pivots, providing
opportunities for external attackers to gain internal network access by exploiting VPNs,
firewalls, or other internet-facing technologies. These flaws are often used in
conjunction with local code execution vulnerabilities or network protocol bugs to
escalate privileges or move laterally across corporate networks.
2020 included multiple vulnerability suites that disproportionately affected
operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) implementations of lowlevel software libraries. While these vulnerability groups garnered quite a lot of
attention, Rapid7 and SCADAfence research teams independently determined their
exploitability to be much lower than some other vulnerabilities affecting the OT
ecosystem. Vendor and supply chain fragmentation further underscored the need for
long-term visibility across OT networks.
Defenders had to contend with a steady stream of patch bypasses in 2020, which
disrupted remediation cycles and introduced risk that was more likely to be
missed. Our vulnerability dataset includes nine patch bypasses or incomplete patches,
seven of which circumvent fixes for known-exploited or high-value parent
vulnerabilities. One trend we observed is that it’s common for software vendors to
mitigate disclosed attack chains rather than addressing the root cause of bugs reported
to them; this may partially account for the prevalence of patch bypasses last year.

Big Picture: 2020 Threats

Big Picture: 2020 Threats Actively Exploited and Other Significant
CVEs
In an interesting twist, 2020 marked the advent of zero-day disclosures and public threat
intelligence coming directly from the U.S. National Security Agency (as well as from more
traditional sources like CISA and country CERTs). This nascent practice, no doubt intended
to accelerate patching as much as to demonstrate a new commitment to transparency, has
contributed to a heightened sense of urgency—and occasionally alarm—that is amplified by
security news media reporting (rightfully) on intelligence agency alerts. It is difficult to discuss
the threat landscape of the past year without acknowledging the role U.S. agencies have
played in shaping perceptions and influencing priorities, particularly since news headlines on
these disclosures are likely to reach executives and business stakeholders as well as
security practitioner audiences.

5/51

We make a distinction in our data between vulnerabilities that see widespread, indiscriminate
exploitation (widespread threats) and those that, based on available evidence, have been
used in highly targeted attacks (targeted threats). Almost all of the targeted threats in our
dataset were reported by a single credible source as having been exploited, with no further
public reports of exploitation thereafter. This includes many of the flaws in our targeted threat
category that were zero-days when they were disclosed.
Conversely, CVEs in our widespread threat category have typically been exploited by a
range of malicious actors, from botnet controllers to APTs to low-skilled attackers throwing
public proof-of-concept (PoC) code against internet-exposed hosts. In other words, if we
have classified a threat as widespread, that classification is based on the volume of attacks
rather than who specifically is doing the attacking. When applying learnings from 2020 to the
current year and beyond, organizations should expect to conduct incident response
investigations that look for IOCs and suspicious activity during widespread threat events in
addition to activating emergency patching protocols.
What is a threat?
When there is an adversary with the intent, capability, and opportunity, a threat exists. When
two or more of these elements are present (e.g., intent and capability, but no opportunity), we
call it an impending threat, because there is just one missing piece before it becomes a true
threat. When there is just one element present (e.g., an opportunity in the form of a software
vulnerability), we call it a potential threat. There is the potential for it to turn into a true threat,
although there are additional components that need to come to fruition before it has a real
impact to most organizations.
6/51

Widespread Threats
Fourteen CVEs posed widespread threats to organizations in 2020 and are likely to stalk
unpatched systems well into 2021. The impact of successful exploitation for each of these
vulnerabilities is high; most allow for remote code execution (RCE) at a minimum, but several
allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to take over infrastructure or gain access to internal
networks through exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing systems or interfaces. It’s worth
noting that two of the entries in this category—Zoho ManageEngine CVE-2020-10189 and
vBulletin CVE-2020-17496—were released into the wild as zero-days with stable exploit
code before the vendors made patches available.

2020 opened with widespread exploitation of Citrix NetScaler and Telerik UI. Zoho
ManageEngine and SaltStack Salt followed suit in the spring, while the second half of the
year was punctuated by internet-scale exploitation of severe vulnerabilities in F5 BIG-IP,
Microsoft NetLogon Remote Protocol, and Oracle WebLogic Server. The combination of an
authentication bypass and a remote code execution flaw in MobileIron’s Mobile Device
Management (MDM) solution also offered a glimpse at how mobile device management
software may prove a potent attack vector in the future, even after the remote workforce has
begun to transition back to the office.
There are three outliers in this group that merit closer inspection. The first is CVE-20200796, or “SMBGhost,” a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft’s Server Message
Block (SMB) 3.1.1 protocol that the company inadvertently published in their March 2020
Patch Tuesday advisory before a patch had been released. An out-of-band security update
came within 24 hours of the slip, but not before the security community had likened the flaw
to MS17-010, the SMB vulnerability suite exploited as part of the 2017 WannaCry and
NotPetya attacks that cost global organizations hundreds of millions of dollars.
Network defenders feared the vulnerability would be widely exploited and wormed, but no
worms have materialized, at least thus far. In fact, while public proof-of-concept code and an
errant botnet took aim at SMBGhost, it’s a bit difficult to argue that the exploits fully arrived,
either: Modern memory protections meant that even though a few local exploits made their
way to market, remote code execution remains nontrivial (mass migration to remote work
may actually have helped limit the vuln’s impact). Even the Lemon_Duck botnet appeared to
9/51

give up on its SMBGhost exploit module after a trial run. We’ve included CVE-2020-0796 in
our list of widespread threats for the sake of methodological consistency, but it’s an
exception instead of the rule.
Another exception is CVE-2020-3452, a read-only path traversal flaw in Cisco’s Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) products that allowed remote
attackers to enumerate files on target devices. The anomaly here is value rather than
exploitability—although a PoC was quickly published and, to quote Microsoft’s Kevin
Beaumont, “mass spammed across [the] internet,” exploitation offered attackers no useful
access at all. CVE-2020-3452 is also the only vulnerability from among our sample of
widespread threats for which Metasploit opted not to prioritize an exploit.
Finally, if there were a 2020 Microsoft vulnerability that rivaled MS17-010 for severity and
catastrophic impact to networked systems, the title would go to “Zerologon” (CVE-20201472), a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) that allows
attackers to bypass authentication and compromise Windows Servers running as domain
controllers, paving the way for complete takeover of Active Directory domains. The rare
CVSS-10 privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft’s August 2020 Patch Tuesday release
raised eyebrows, but the advisory was characteristically sparse. Details remained thin until
Secura researchers released in-depth analysis mid-September, which was followed by
rampant exploitation.
Both Zerologon and the MS17-010 suite of vulnerabilities gave attackers trivially exploitable
paths for lateral movement that lend themselves well to ransomware campaigns (including
ransomworms). Unlike the 2017 CVEs, which provided for both remote and local code
execution, successful exploitation of Zerologon requires network access to a domain
controller—in other words, an attacker would need either an internet-exposed domain
controller or some type of initial access to the network (e.g., a network pivot). 2020’s threat
list included quite a few potential network pivots; we’ll come back to this later on.

Targeted Threats
Roughly half of the actively exploited vulnerabilities in our dataset fell into the “targeted
threat” category—which, again, does not mean these CVEs haven’t been (or won’t be)
exploited more broadly, only that there is not yet any public evidence of exploitation at scale.
In particular, Sophos XG Firewall CVE-2020-12271 and VMware ESXi CVE-2020-3992
below are incredibly attractive targets for attackers due to the considerable access they
provide (Sophos has a detailed analysis of the zero-day attack against their XG Firewall
here). The same goes for the three Citrix vulnerabilities, which were resolved in one update
and saw small-scale exploitation even as they were moving through coordinated disclosure.

*Kaspersky reported CVE-2020-0986 after they had seen in-the-wild attacks targeting the
flaw, but said that Microsoft had already prepared a patch by the time they notified them. We
still classify this CVE as a zero-day even if Kaspersky was not the only company to observe
exploitation.
Eight of the CVEs above—fully half of this group—were reported to the software producers
as zero-days that had already seen in-the-wild exploitation: three by Google’s Project Zero
and/or Threat Analysis Group (CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-17087, and CVE-2020-15999),
one by the NSA (VMware CVE-2020-4006), and the rest via various security researchers
and firms. SolarWinds Orion CVE-2020-10148 is among this group, and it bears mentioning
here that it is extremely likely this vulnerability has been more broadly exploited. At time of
writing, however, there were no public reports of widespread exploitation—only reports of
mass scanning—so we have classified it as a targeted threat until broader exploitation is
confirmed.
The CVEs in Windows DNS Server (2020-1350), Windows CryptoAPI (2020-0601), Cisco
IOS XR (2020-3118), and VMware Workspace ONE (2020-4006), in addition to all three
Citrix vulnerabilities, were included in Q4 2020 publications issued by the NSA on
vulnerabilities being exploited by either Russian (VMware CVE-2020-4006) or Chinese (the
rest) state-sponsored threat actors. (The NSA was also the entity that disclosed “Curveball”
CVE-2020-0601 to Microsoft back in January 2020.) All told, NSA communications were the
source material for a significant portion of our 2020 security threat dataset.

Impending Threats
With actively exploited vulnerabilities out of the way, we can turn our attention to some of
2020’s notable impending threats. As a brief reminder, an impending threat occurs when
two elements of the threat triangle are present, but not all three. Since this paper centers on
vulnerabilities, the opportunity element is present by default. The impending threats we
present in this section include either a capability (i.e., a mature exploit) or a proxy for
measurable intent. Quite a few of the vulnerabilities we’ve classified as targeted threats
would have stayed in the impending threat category without the NSA’s Q4 2020 bulletins on
flaws exploited by state-sponsored actors.
Note: Several of the vulnerabilities in this group have public proof-of-concept (PoC) code
available, but for the purposes of this paper, we consider public PoC to be similar to technical
details in that it may enable others to build successful exploit chains or improve upon attack

13/51

techniques, but it isn’t the same as mature code. Proof-of-concept code often has a way to
go before it becomes a fully weaponized and documented exploit, if it makes it that far at all.
As Marie Antoinette famously pointed out,
"PoC works on my machine; an exploit works on yours."

The “exploit available” references in this table all represent Metasploit modules that have
been developed and tested for compatibility across a range of platforms. Metasploit is not the
only toolkit we consider to be mature as far as capability goes—the Zerologon exploit built on
Impacket, for instance, would have met the “exploit available” bar even before it was ported
to Metasploit Framework. In the same vein, “high-value target” is a subjective term, though a
common-sense one given the broad popularity of the products we’ve listed. “Technical details
widely available” denotes in-depth, public information on identifying, triggering, and
(frequently) exploiting the vulnerability in question. Technical details commonly include proofof-concept code or demonstrations.
16/51

When a vulnerability occurs in a product with demonstrable value to attackers and a recent
history of exploitation, it stands to reason that the intent component of the threat triangle is
present even if there’s not yet evidence of successful in-the-wild exploitation. There might be
no better example of this principle than Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint vulnerabilities,
three of which are notable impending threats (SharePoint CVE-2020-16952, and Exchange
CVEs 2020-16875 and 2020-17132). Both products have remained consistently attractive
targets for zero-day research, exploit development, and in-the-wild attacks over the years,
which is no surprise given that vulnerabilities in Exchange and SharePoint environments can
facilitate full compromises of Active Directory.
"We consider most critical-rated and many important-rated CVEs in Microsoft
Exchange and SharePoint to be strong impending threat candidates, regardless of
whether exploit code has been released."
Unfortunately, patch rates continue to lag, as seen in the following data:

A few other CVEs in this group are worth highlighting for their value to would-be attackers:
HP Device Manager CVE-2020-6926 and VMware vCenter Server CVE-2020-3952 are
severe vulnerabilities in management software for Windows thin clients and virtualization
infrastructure, respectively. Exploitation of these vulns gives an attacker broad access to not
only the target software itself, but also all the downstream assets managed by that software.
SaltStack Salt CVEs 2020-16846 and 2020-25592 are also severe vulnerabilities that, when
chained, offer unauthenticated, remote attackers the opportunity to gain root access to the

17/51

target system and fully compromise networked infrastructure. Finally, lest we forget that
Cisco’s Jabber instant messaging platform is still in use, CVE-2020-3495 presents local
attackers with half of a simple attack chain that can be used to worm corporate networks.

When security and IT teams disrupt scheduled patch cycles to remediate a new vulnerability
or threat, they do so with the assumption that the vendor-supplied patch or mitigation has
been developed with a critical eye and is (at least somewhat) trustworthy. Attackers work off
a wholly different guiding principle—namely, that the discovery of one flaw means there are
likely more just waiting in the wings, frequently in the same function, protocol, or section of
the target product’s code base. However, it hardly makes sense for attackers to put effort into
hunting for zero-day vulnerabilities when they can change a single character in an exploit for
a patched vulnerability and blow past the patch as if it weren’t even there.
2020 revealed a number of patch bypass CVEs and incomplete fixes across a large crosssection of vendors, products, web applications, operating systems, and libraries. We detail
nine of them here, but these are far from all-inclusive. 2020 was a banner year for patch
bypasses, which is unfortunate for the many organizations whose patch cycles were
disrupted or whose risk increased without their knowledge. Many of the patch bypasses we
include in this report also have parent vulns that have either been actively exploited in the
wild (e.g., Oracle WebLogic Server CVE-2020-14750, Windows kernel CVE-2020-17008,
vBulletin CVE-2020-17496) or are widely documented (e.g., Windows “PrintDemon” CVE2020-1337, which, incidentally, also has a patch bypass).
What might explain this vulnerability déjà vu? In some cases, a vulnerability’s complexity can
make solutions correspondingly complex to develop quickly and well. In fact,
Many of the patch bypass techniques Rapid7 researchers evaluated over the course of
the year were possible because filtering was added to stages of the original attack
chain in lieu of addressing the bug’s root cause.
19/51

Microsoft Exchange CVE-2020-16875 is a good example of this, where the “fix” mitigated the
disclosed attack chain instead of the root cause, leading to the disclosure of patch bypass
CVE-2020-17132.
It can also be difficult to address root cause when a vulnerability occurs in a component or
behavior that’s closely related to the core architecture of the host system, which may not be
able to be modified without adversely affecting legitimate use. Sometimes this occurs when
the vulnerability is a feature that can be abused within the application, as with vBulletin CVE2020-17496. The vulnerability in this case was related to how PHP templates were
processed—intended and important functionality within vBulletin. If you’re looking for a
second use case, this PyYAML library vulnerability is a good one. In both cases, the
maintaining projects opted to implement filtering and other controls to restrict access to the
features that had been abused. Ultimately, of course, those controls were bypassed.
The prevalence of patch bypasses over the past year underscores the need for defense-indepth strategies that include awareness of critical or exposed systems. See the guidance
section at the end of this report for high-level recommendations.

The Dream of a Common Language

20/51

The Dream of a Common Language Practical Vulnerability Shorthand
When getting to know a new vulnerability, the first thing our research teams look for is an
understanding of root cause and what an attacker might use the bug to achieve.
Vulnerabilities arise from hundreds of conditions spanning all layers of the stack—from
application programming errors to cryptographic implementations to hardware bugs and
beyond. Likewise, the potential impact of any given vulnerability can vary widely based on
implementation, security controls, and the sensitivity of the data or permissions an attacker
can obtain as a result of exploitation. (To use an example from our own data, a remote file
disclosure vulnerability might yield as little as benign source code files or as much
as sensitive account credentials.)
As you may have noticed by now, we’ve characterized the vulnerabilities in our report
dataset by their attacker utility and vulnerability class in addition to separating them by threat
status. Attacker utility describes what an attacker can hope to gain as a result of successful
exploitation—this often maps to a part of an exploit chain—while vulnerability class is an
umbrella term that encompasses both root cause and the type of high-level technique that
might trigger it.

21/51

We’ve defined four vulnerability classes—improper access control, memory corruption,
injection, and deserialization—that are useful for making initial assessments of readily
available attacker tooling and forming high-level hypotheses on relative exploitability.
Injection attacks, for instance, use specially crafted input and techniques (e.g., SQL
injection, operating system command injection) to compromise data integrity or run arbitrary
code as a high-privileged user. These attacks tend to be stable and reliable, which makes
them less likely to knock over systems than, say, attacks leveraging memory corruption
flaws. Deserialization vulnerabilities come with a reputation for high exploitability and have a
wealth of off-the-shelf tools with which to build exploit chains. And improper access control
flaws—the vulnerability class most represented in both our dataset overall and in the
widespread threats we’ve included—run the gamut from complex weaponization
requirements to trivial exploitability using curl.
Deserialization and improper access control bugs together are responsible for 11 of the
most severe and impactful vulnerabilities of 2020.
Improper access control vulnerabilities in particular posed a consistent threat to corporate
networks, allowing attackers to bypass authentication (if it existed at all), execute code, add
administrative users, and write files to disk. These flaws consistently blurred the line between
vulnerability management and incident response and accounted for many of 2020’s
compromise investigations.

The second type of metadata our researchers define when analyzing emergent threats
answers the question, “As an attacker, what does this vulnerability get me?” Remote code
execution is how vendors and CVE numbering authorities (CNAs) frequently describe highimpact vulnerabilities, but in some cases, that description downplays the ways that severe
CVEs can be used to further compromise a network.

24/51

Unsurprisingly, vulnerabilities that provide attackers with remote code execution opportunities
—i.e., the ability to execute a payload on a target system—are the most represented type of
utility across the 50 CVEs we analyzed, at nearly 50% of the total dataset. Local code
execution features much less prominently, which is also hardly surprising since it’s much
easier to launch internet-scale attacks from, well, the internet. We’ve already discussed the
attractiveness of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to compromise entire swaths of network
infrastructure (e.g., virtualization or automation infrastructure) instead of just a single target.
It’s much rarer for file enumeration CVEs to headline in security news or social media,
but information leaks are important primitives that can open up paths to code execution
and turn post-authentication CVEs into pre-authentication vulns.
One of the best examples of this is CVE-2019-11510, a remote, unauthenticated arbitrary file
read vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPNs whose exploitation disclosed sensitive information
like passwords and private keys. That information gave attackers what they needed to
execute commands as root on vulnerable VPN servers. (GitLab CVE-2020-10977 provides
another more recent example!)
All of this brings us to our final attacker utility type—one that played such a major role in
2020’s threat landscape that it deserves a section all its own.

The ability to pivot from an external network to an internal network is a significant milestone
for attackers. A network pivot—aptly if unimaginatively named—gives the attacker visibility
into both internal and external traffic, most often by exploiting internet-facing systems such
as VPNs, firewalls, routers, and other gateway devices. Network pivots aid in data
exfiltration, traffic sniffing, and further attacks within the target network; they are, in short,
extremely valuable to both state-sponsored and low-skilled attackers, along with penetration
testers the world over.
Some of the past year’s most high-profile and widely exploited vulnerabilities fell into the
network pivot category. The first vulnerability to see large-scale exploitation in 2020 was
Citrix NetScaler/Application Delivery Controller CVE-2019-19781, a directory traversal flaw
that made its debut in December 2019 and harried incident responders well into the new
26/51

year. The vulnerability allowed remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute code on
vulnerable gateways—and it wasn’t the only Citrix CVE that acted as a network pivot point
for attackers in 2020. The NSA warned in October that Chinese state-sponsored actors were
exploiting three other vulnerabilities in Citrix’s Application Delivery Controller, at least one of
which could be used to extract valid VPN sessions with which to establish a foothold on
internal networks.
For many network defenders, June 29 through July 29, 2020 was a particularly nightmarish
stretch of an already challenging year: No fewer than four CVSS 10 vulnerabilities hit
advisories, mailing lists, and news alerts during this period, three of which occurred within
two weeks of one another. On June 29, Palo Alto Networks published a security advisory for
CVE-2020-2021, a SAML authentication bypass affecting the company’s PAN-OS operating
system, which runs on gateways, portals, VPNs, and the firm’s next-generation firewalls.
SAML, or security assertion markup language, was (fortunately) not the default
authentication scheme, and the company reinforced that attackers would need network
access for successful exploitation. Still, an initial Rapid7 Labs study revealed just under
70,000 instances of Palo Alto Networks’ Global Protect VPN on the public internet—an
enticing pool of targets for attackers looking to access protected resources and find a way
into corporate networks.
A day later, on June 30, 2020, F5 Networks quietly published a security bulletin advising
customers of CVE-2020-5902, a severe remote code execution vulnerability in “undisclosed
pages” of the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) of its BIG-IP product. Within a few
days, multiple confirmations of exploitation in the wild had surfaced, along with reports of
coin miners and automated secret scrapers targeting vulnerable BIG-IP instances, several
thousand of which were exposed to the internet. F5 disclosed on July 8 that their previously
released mitigation advice was able to be circumvented, and that anyone whose TMUI had
been exposed to the internet should invoke incident response procedures—a series of
events similar to Citrix CVE-2019-19781 earlier in the year, albeit on a bigger scale.
It wasn’t until the end of July, 2020 that security firm Claroty released research detailing
multiple critical vulnerabilities affecting various VPN implementations used primarily by
industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) networks. Taken together,
the CVEs allowed attackers to decrypt VPN traffic, execute code remotely, and pilfer
credentials for use in further attacks. If that weren’t enough, it transpired that some 1,900
odd VPN gateways were exposing their Telnet administration port to the public internet.
In each of these cases, the gateway position of the vulnerable products amplified the
vulnerabilities’ severity and deepened the impact of exploitation. In October, several weeks
after Zerologon exploitation had wrought havoc on vulnerable domain controllers, the U.S.
Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) published an alert warning that APT
actors were chaining network pivot vulnerabilities with Zerologon in attacks against federal,
state, local, and tribal networks, in addition to critical infrastructure and elections
organizations. Several of the vulnerabilities CISA listed as potential targets—including Palo
27/51

Alto Networks, F5, and Citrix flaws discussed above—are included in this report as potential
or active threats. They aren’t alone: As a start, any of the vulnerabilities identified as a
network pivot in our data could be used to similar ends. Their utility to attackers should make
them a high priority for defenders.

*Kaspersky reported CVE-2020-0986 after they had seen in-the-wild attacks targeting the
flaw, but said that Microsoft had already prepared a patch by the time they notified them. We
still classify this CVE as a zero-day even if Kaspersky was not the only company to observe
exploitation.
As many security practitioners who have experienced the transition into a post-WannaCry
world can attest, MS17-010 and the ETERNALBLUE-based attacks of 2017 created a new
paradigm for how the information security industry reacts to vulnerabilities in Windows
network protocols like SMB and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). Patch Tuesday protocol
CVEs instill dread in network security teams, and the infosec zeitgeist is quick to christen
protocol vulnerabilities with a variety of “Blue”- and “Bleed”-related nicknames while security
news keeps the term “wormable” fresh in our minds. None of it is unfair, unwarranted, or
technically incorrect...and yet.
2020 security headlines trumpeted at least four wormable vulnerabilities in Windows
networking protocols, as well as a smattering of others across major vendors. Despite the
notoriety these bugs commanded, the prophesied worms failed to materialize, and with the
exception of “SMBGhost” (as mentioned earlier, even this distinction is dubious), not one has
seen exploitation at scale. Why?
Most any vulnerability can be exploited given sufficient skill, opportunity, and motivation. But
certain bugs are much more difficult to trigger and weaponize reliably. We’re speaking, of
course, of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the wild child of the vulnerability research world
and the target of famous exploits like ETERNALBLUE and (to a much lesser extent)
BlueKeep. Memory corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involves the misuse
of data to alter memory and cause unexpected behavior. The overarching memory corruption
category also contains more granular vulnerability types like stack and heap buffer overflows,
type confusion, and use-after-free (UAFs).
When exploited successfully, memory corruption vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code
execution, or else in unhandled exceptions that cause an application to crash, triggering a
denial of service (DoS) condition. The former is more frequently seen in local attacks, while
the latter figures more prominently in remote attacks against internet-accessible targets. In
recent years, broad adoption of safeguards has significantly complicated exploitation of
memory corruption vulnerabilities. As a result, developing successful attacks takes skill and
often requires manual secondary reconnaissance (e.g., finding a heap or kernel memory leak

30/51

to execute an exploit successfully), which limits utility at scale. Even when a memory
corruption exploit is successful at scale—i.e., ETERNALBLUE—reliability is likely to remain a
challenge.
On the other hand, exploits written for memory corruption vulns have a few compelling
advantages over easier-to-develop attacks. Arbitrary code execution within a process or
other memory space conceals malicious code better and leaves fewer artifacts (e.g.,
touching disk, spawning new processes), which translates to better operational security for
malicious actors. These types of vulnerabilities are also likely to be present in targets straight
out of the box, frequently in base-level functionality that doesn’t require authentication or
separate installation. Take October’s “Bad Neighbor” vulnerability (CVE-2020-16898), for
example: The CVE affected all versions of Windows by default without needing to account
for configuration—uniform attack surface area even if exploitation is finickier.
It’s not surprising that “Bad Neighbor,” “BlueGate,” “SigRed,” and several more of the
year’s high-profile CVEs never saw the release of highly effective public tools, or in
many cases, any public tooling whatsoever. Turning memory corruption DoS actions
into fully weaponized remote code execution is non-trivial.
But even in the absence of public tooling, it would be surprising—to the point of near
impossibility—if fully weaponized exploits for these types of bugs weren’t developed
privately.
State-sponsored actors and other sophisticated attackers typically aren’t resourceconstrained the way in-house researchers at security firms or other corporate environments
are. Neither, to a lesser degree, are vulnerability developers who sell zero-day exploits to the
highest bidder—either directly or through brokers who act as a black box for both sides of the
transaction. With that in mind, it’s understandable that a number of 2020’s memory
corruption vulnerabilities saw exploitation by state-sponsored actors, whether they were
disclosed as zero-days or included in intelligence agency communications about foreign
adversary operations months after their release. Oracle Solaris CVE-2020-14871 and
Windows kernel CVE-2020-0986 both fit the former description, while SigRed (CVE-20201350) and Cisco IOS XR CVE-2020-3118 fit the latter. The IOS XR vulnerability is a fantastic
example of a bug that is entirely impractical at scale—successful exploitation requires an
attacker to be on the local area network, directly attached to the vulnerable switch—but is
evidently a bit more useful to state-sponsored threat actors.
We will see more of these types of bugs in 2021; we may even see more high-severity
memory corruption bugs in Windows network protocols. While we share the security
community’s concern in many of these cases, “patch but don’t panic” remains a good mantra
to live by.
Clicks and likes may be reasonable metrics for notoriety, but they’re poor proxies for
true risk.

The following section was written by the SCADAfence research team. SCADAfence is a
global leader in securing operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks
for enterprises, industrial organizations, and critical infrastructure. Learn more here.
2020 witnessed a number of high-severity vulnerabilities that threatened OT and industrial
networks and underlined the challenges of deeply embedded, often customized
implementations of vulnerable technologies. But 2020’s vulnerability suites, imbued with
catchy names, aren’t the first potential threats to highlight growing risk across an industry
segment that’s been caught in the middle of some of the world’s largest cyberattacks.
First, some history: Operational technology (OT) systems are computer-operated systems
that control physical and often critical processes. Many of these systems date back decades,
and it was evident rather quickly that OT environments were not ready for the internet age.
The initial response was to air-gap these systems by disconnecting all network connectivity.
As it turns out, however, that approach was rather impractical. OT companies needed many
of the benefits of connectivity to help them stay updated and competitive—benefits like
improved monitoring and logistics, remote support, software updates, the ability to develop
new connected product offerings, and so on.
OT asset owners, therefore, had to address the challenges of minimizing risk in an
increasingly connected world. Legacy systems are still widely deployed in operational
technology environments, the majority of which have not been designed with security in
mind. It’s an inescapable truth that large numbers of vulnerabilities exist in virtually every
deployed OT system—from heavy equipment and industrial routers to internet-facing portals
and common software libraries. These vulnerabilities affect millions of devices and hundreds
of vendors, and are frequently difficult to mitigate or even identify across individual vendor
implementations.

The Modern OT Threat Landscape
Threats to operational technology environments today include common and targeted
ransomware along with targeted campaigns like Trisis or the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian
power grid. In 2020, OT and IoT vendors also found themselves responding to a variety of
vulnerabilities in common low-level software libraries—namely, common TCP/IP libraries
shared by many vendors and products. These groups of CVEs, named Ripple20 and
Amnesia:33, pose a challenge to both vendors tasked with developing fixes and OT
organizations tasked with reducing risk. Vendor and supply chain fragmentation means that
very often, millions of devices are affected by these CVEs, and the full list of vulnerable
products and vendors may be populated over the course of months or years.

34/51

Whenever there are new vulnerabilities in shared libraries, the level of exploitability varies
from device to device; as you might imagine, this creates quite a lot of confusion and adds
another layer of complexity to the already complex industrial vulnerabilities space. Earlier this
year, SCADAfence researchers tested one of the more severe Ripple20 vulnerabilities in our
lab. CVE-2020-11898 has a CVSS score of 9.1 (critical) and can potentially allow remote
attackers to read sensitive information. After testing on multiple devices that were reported
vulnerable by their vendors, we found the vulnerability to be non-exploitable.
SCADAfence researchers also tested the exploitability of several of the more serious
Amnesia:33 vulnerabilities and determined that exploitation was extremely unlikely outside of
specific, tailor-made attack scenarios, since implementations vary from device to device.
Furthermore, of the four remote code execution vulnerabilities released as part of the
Amnesia:33 research, three of them reside in the way DNS domain names are encoded and
the way DNS response packets are processed; another arises from the way IPv6 ICMP echo
packets are processed. Why is this relevant? Because compared to other industries, it’s
much less common for OT environments to use DNS over hard-coded IP addresses, and
most devices these days—especially OT networks—use IPv4 over IPv6.
There were, however, several vulnerabilities published in 2020 that do pose an active threat
to OT environments and industrial organizations. Perhaps the most important set of 2020
vulnerabilities are CVE-2020-7486 and CVE-2020-7491, both of which affect Schneider
Electric Triconex SIS devices. SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems) are critical process
controls used to prevent disasters, like fires or explosions, in industrial environments. In July
2020, CISA in the U.S. warned that these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely and with
little skill. The same day, CISA and the NSA issued a joint alert recommending immediate
actions to reduce exposure across OT and control systems.

OT Security Guidance
While asset owners often have comprehensive asset inventories of Windows endpoints,
servers, and other devices, there is a large visibility gap when it comes to OT devices. This
gap means that asset owners are not able to feed necessary information into their
organizations’ vulnerability management processes—information that includes
comprehensive details on vendors, device models, versions, and network exposure.
Managing risk is difficult if not impossible without an understanding of attack surface area
introduced by OT devices.
Whenever critical vulnerabilities are published, and especially when they are known to be
exploited, asset owners should perform assessments to determine the potential impact of the
vulnerability and the organization’s possible exposure. Some asset owners may also base
their impact analyses solely on CVSS scores, but these can be misleading and lead to
inefficient prioritization.

35/51

It helps when organizations are aware of common-sense facts when evaluating research or
news articles on vulnerabilities affecting OT and IoT devices. Organizations that don’t
account for mitigating factors, such as uncommon configurations or unlikely attack scenarios,
have a higher chance of investing resources in activities that don’t end up reducing their risk.
Asset owners should also consider adopting automated tools that assist in the identification,
prioritization, and remediation of OT vulnerabilities, in support of an OT vulnerability
management program. Ideally, tooling should help OT network managers understand the
size of their attack surface area and the probability of exploitation; this may include
automated asset inventories, vulnerability correlation engines, and/or network exposure
analyzers. For more information about this topic, please refer to the SCADAfence OT
Vulnerability Management guide, which doubles as a comprehensive guide to industrial
device patching.

Guidance for Defenders Key Takeaways From 2020 Threat
Responses
The tried-and-true pieces of guidance in this section have impeded exploitation for many of
the vulnerabilities in this report and aided defenders in more quickly identifying signs of
compromise or suspicious activity. We recognize that advice is rarely one-size-fits-all, and
that security program maturity varies widely even among organizations of the same size,
industry, and market cap. Nevertheless, the following suggestions encapsulate learnings that
will apply to future threats as well as the specific risks highlighted in this paper:
Patch early and as often as possible, even when widespread exploitation isn’t
seen.
When severe vulnerabilities are exploited within hours or days of publication, patching should
be performed on an emergency basis, if possible. It is also wise to monitor for suspicious
behavior and events in addition to fine-tuning intrusion detection and prevention systems.
Relying on common rules and signatures alone is inadvisable during critical situations, as
attackers routinely find ways to evade them. F5 BIG-IP CVE-2020-5902 is a fine example of
this.
Several of the highest-severity vulnerabilities in this report weren’t widely exploited until
weeks or months after their publication (e.g., Zerologon, SMBghost, Microsoft Exchange
Server CVE-2020-0688). Wherever possible, implementing a 30-day patch cycle will help
protect against attacks with a longer tail, especially from commodity attackers who operate
on economies of scale (e.g., botnet operators, ransomware campaigns, your everyday script
kiddies, and so on).
Defense in depth is a more effective strategy than patching alone.
Skilled attackers are resourceful and, at times, utterly opportunistic. They can and will
use any tool—any technique, any weakness, any piece of information—to build
successful attack chains. Patches are not always effective, either, as evidenced by
CVE-2020-14882 and CVE-2020-16875, which saw repeated patch bypasses.
Additionally, many of the CVEs treated individually in this report can be used in concert
with one or more additional vulnerabilities to achieve something beyond the scope of a
single CVE’s impact. Defenders can get ahead of future attacks by taking care not to
treat individual vulnerabilities as if they existed in a vacuum, but instead choosing to
implement controls and detection mechanisms across the whole of their environment.
Finally, ensuring that (preferably aggregated) logging is set up across networks and hosts will
save some time during active threat events. There are several community-driven signature
repositories and low-cost (or free!) rulesets that can give defenders at least basic visibility

38/51

into potential intrusions in their environments, along with a plethora of commercial solutions.
Knowing ahead of time what kind of visibility defenders have into suspicious events will drive
faster and more effective response during critical situations.
Keep an up-to-date inventory list that emphasizes assets or products that sit on
the perimeter and/or may be used as pivot points for external attackers to gain
access to the internal network.
Understanding attack surface area and critical network entry points saves time when severe
vulnerabilities surface in internet-facing technologies. Pay particular attention to security
gateway products such as VPNs and firewalls, as well as anything else that’s exposed by
common practice or necessity. CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2020-0688 are noteworthy
examples.
Management and administrative interfaces should never be exposed to the public internet.
The same goes for domain controllers and any other assets that organizations would not
want an external attacker to be able to probe, such as IoT devices unwittingly exposed
online. Audit internet-exposed attack surface area regularly, including via external
penetration tests, if possible.
At Rapid7, we believe that research-driven context on vulnerabilities and emergent threats is
critical to building forward-looking security programs and advancing community knowledge.
Security and IT teams face mounting challenges in a heightened threat climate, and we are
committed to partnering with those teams to foster deeper understanding of defense-in-depth
strategies that will strengthen organizations’ security posture both now and in the future.

community analysis of new vulnerabilities and threats, keep an eye on AttackerKB. If you

Appendix
Why These CVEs?
Context is king when analyzing vulnerabilities, just as it is when managing them. Our
investigations into root cause, exploitability, and potential attack vectors often start the same
way as conversations among security stakeholders—with a vendor advisory that pops a red
flag, a bit of private intel from a friend, a tweet thread, or a news article. To put it simply, the
vulnerabilities in this report piqued our interest, as much for the community’s reaction to them
as for any bona fide threats that emerged. Notably, they also affect software and systems
relied upon by many, from enterprises to end users. This dataset does not include all CVEs
or even all active threats we evaluated in 2020, but it does represent a diverse sample of
attacker use cases and exploitation case studies.
39/51

Of course, our intent is not to imply that any one CVE or vulnerability group is less important
than others. Security teams, network administrators, and defenders at large have in-depth
understanding of which assets are critical in their environments and how action taken may
affect their business priorities. What we offer is an attacker-centric view of the vulnerability
landscape that Rapid7 customers and the security community can use to inform the policies
and practices that they employ as part of a larger defense-in-depth strategy.

Notes on Methodology
CVEs featured in this report are from 2020 with two exceptions: Telerik UI CVE-2019-18935
and Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway CVE-2019-19781, both of which were published late in
2019 and saw sustained exploitation throughout 2020.
Since the trustworthiness of our data is important, we cite primary sources wherever possible
for vulnerabilities we’ve listed as exploited in the wild—that is, we reference firsthand
accounts of exploitation from the organizations or individuals who detected, verified, and
reported them. Examples of primary sources referenced throughout this paper include U.S.
intelligence agency alerts of advanced persistent threat (APT) exploitation; security firm
analyses of threats and IOCs they’ve tracked during incident response or other
investigations; and vendor advisories that specify exploitation in the wild (this includes CVEs
that are disclosed as zero-days). In the interest of readability, when firsthand reports of
exploitation are disparate and varied, we will occasionally cite an article in a security news
publication that aggregates those accounts.
The CVEs we have categorized as exploited in the wild in this report are not the only
vulnerabilities actively exploited during the 2020 calendar year. For example, we have
excluded a number of other exploited bugs in Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox. Google
Project Zero has a spreadsheet of some other zero-days exploited in the wild in 2020 here.

Glossary of Terms
Attacker Utilities
Remote code execution (RCE): Code execution on a remote target. Typically refers to the
ability to execute a payload on a target system (e.g., obtain a shell session). Aids in
credential stealing, data exfiltration, and so on.
Local code execution: The ability to run code locally on a system to which the attacker
already has some access. Most commonly used to escalate privileges (e.g., by executing
code as the user running the vulnerable application).

40/51

Network infrastructure compromise: Compromise of networked infrastructure, such as a
network management system or backup system, that may give an attacker access to
everything managed by that software. Vulnerabilities in virtualization, automation, and/or
device management infrastructure all fall into this category.
Network pivot: The ability to pivot from an external network to an internal network, most
often by exploiting internet-facing systems such as VPNs, firewalls, routers, and other
gateway devices. A network pivot gives an attacker visibility into both internal and external
traffic and aids in data exfiltration, traffic sniffing, and further attacks within the target
network.
File enumeration: The ability to enumerate files on a target. File reads do not give an
attacker a path to code execution by themselves, but instead function as primitives that allow
attackers to gather information that enables a secondary part of an exploit chain (e.g.,
remote code execution). Can aid in turning a post-authentication vulnerability into a preauthentication vulnerability.

Vulnerability Classes
Deserialization is the process through which an application is able to convert data from a
portable format to data types native to its own language. Many modern languages support
deserialization, including Java, .NET, Python, and Ruby. The deserialization process can
pose a threat to security when the data that is loaded into the native language can be
tampered with by a malicious party. Typical attacks involve configuring the data to invoke a
method with the arguments necessary to execute an operating system command. This
results in command execution in the context of the loading application. Common solutions to
this security problem include cryptographically signing the data to ensure its authenticity and
utilizing an allowlist of data types that are permitted to be loaded. Associated CWEs: CWE502.
Improper Access Control refers to a missing or insufficient access control to a particular
interface into a system (most often a remotely accessible API). Improper uses of
cryptography for the purpose of authentication also fall under this vulnerability class.
Common solutions to this problem include proper authentication, authorization, and
accounting implementations for all sensitive interfaces, as well as secure management of all
related secrets. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE-285, CWE-200, CWE-287,
CWE-732.
Memory Corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involve the misuse of data
through a variety of means to alter memory and produce unexpected behavior. This
vulnerability class includes improper boundary enforcement, type confusion, uninitialized
data use, and the use of data after it has been freed, to name a few. These vulnerabilities
often manifest themselves in languages that are not considered "type-safe.” Successful
exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code execution within
41/51

the context of the running application, or in an unhandled exception that causes the
application to crash and triggers a denial of service (DoS) condition. Common solutions to
this problem typically involve additional validation on parameters to key operations, such as
those used to load and store data. Successful exploitation of these classes of vulnerabilities
has become more complex in recent years due to the variety of countermeasures and
safeguards that have been developed, such as kASLR, Control Flow Guard, win32k Type
Isolation, and so on. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE-787, CWE-125, CWE416, CWE-190, CWE-476.
Injection is a large category of vulnerabilities involving specially crafted input that is
interpreted in a particular way by an associated system. Most commonly seen in web
applications, injection attacks are often more specifically labeled by the type of data being
interpreted (e.g., SQL, LDAP, OS commands). The root cause of these vulnerabilities is
almost always insufficient sanitization on data received from a malicious party. Exploitation of
these vulnerabilities tends to be reliable, rarely resulting in service degradation unless
intended (such as through SQL or OS commands).
The context under which the logic is executed typically depends on how it is interpreted. In
the case of a web application, for example, SQL injection may be executed on a back-end
database server, while OS commands are injected on the front-end web server, and
JavaScript is executed by the end user’s browser. This class of vulnerabilities is therefore
unique in that it commonly involves a vulnerability in one system compromising the integrity
of others. Common solutions to this problem typically involve implementing strict sanitization
on parameters though the use of allowlists. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE79, CWE-20, CWE-89, CWE-94.

*Kaspersky reported CVE-2020-0986 after they had seen in-the-wild attacks targeting the
flaw, but said that Microsoft had already prepared a patch by the time they notified them. We
still classify this CVE as a zero-day even if Kaspersky was not the only company to observe
exploitation.
