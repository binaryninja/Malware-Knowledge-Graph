Ahead of the presidential election, the ASEC analysis team confirmed that malicious Korean
documents disguised as “press release on board the 20th presidential election”
were being distributed. The attacker distributed the malicious Korean document on
February 28th, and the malicious document was not secured, but according to the company's
AhnLab Smart Defense (ASD) infrastructure log, it is estimated that the batch file is driven
through the internal OLE object to execute PowerShell. .

[Figure 1] shows the batch file path and Korean file name confirmed in the infrastructure.
While the same normal Korean document size is 2.06 MB, the malicious Korean document is
2.42 MB, and it seems that the document was created by inserting an additional BAT file
inside.

A similar type of attack was also confirmed on February 7th. According to the article, the
attacker impersonated the National Election Commission (NEC) and distributed malicious
documents disguised as a normal document titled “Public Recruitment of Counting
Observers for the 20th Presidential Election”.

Election Commission” | DailyNK
It was found on the 8th that a North Korean hacking organization was distributing hacking emails impersonating the National Election Commission (NEC). Considering the fact that the
press release distributed by the National Election Commission was used, it is highly likely
that the attack is being carried out targeting journalists in the media, so caution is required.
The common features of the malicious Hangul documents that were circulated at the time
and the documents used in this attack are as follows.

Normal official Korean documents can be found on the official website of the National
Election Commission ( https://www.nec.go.kr/ ), and users should be skeptical when
downloading similar documents from an unknown site.

The attackers seem to be carrying out various attacks impersonating the National Election
Commission as the 20th presidential election approaches. AhnLab continues to monitor
similar malicious behaviors and will share new information as soon as it becomes available.
