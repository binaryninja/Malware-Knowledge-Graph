Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

We believe we’re seeing an evolution and development in Iranian-based cyber activity. In
years past, Iranian actors primarily committed politically-motivated website defacement
and DDoS attacks.1 More recently, however, suspected Iranian actors have destroyed data
on thousands of computers with the Shamoon virus,2 and they have penetrated the Navy
Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), which is used by the U.S. Navy worldwide.3

In this report, we document the activities of the
Ajax Security Team, a hacking group believed to be
operating from Iran. Members of this group have
accounts on popular Iranian hacker forums such as
ashiyane[.]org and shabgard[.]org, and they have
engaged in website defacements under the group
name “AjaxTM” since 2010. By 2014, the Ajax
Security Team had transitioned from performing
defacements (their last defacement was in
December 2013) to malware-based espionage,
using a methodology consistent with other
advanced persistent threat actors in this region.
It is unclear if the Ajax Security Team operates in
isolation or if they are a part of a larger
coordinated effort. The Ajax Security Team itself
uses malware tools that do not appear to be
publicly available. We have seen this group
leverage varied social engineering tactics as a
means to lure their targets into infecting
themselves with malware. Although we have not
observed the use of exploits as a means to infect
victims, members of the Ajax Security Team have
previously used publicly available exploit code in
web site defacement operations.
In sum, FireEye has recently observed the Ajax
Security Team conducting multiple cyber
espionage operations against companies in the
defense industrial base (DIB) within the Unites
States, as well as targeting local Iranian users of
anti-censorship technologies that bypass Iran’s
Internet filtering system.

Background
The transition from patriotic hacking to cyber
espionage is not an uncommon phenomenon. It
typically follows an increasing politicization within
the hacking community, particularly around
geopolitical events. This is followed by increasing
links between the hacking community and the
state, particularly military and/or intelligence
organizations.
In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, a similar
transition occurred within the Chinese hacking
community. During that time period, the Chinese
hacking community engaged in website
defacements and denial of service attacks in
conjunction with incidents such as the accidental
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in
1999, the collision of a U.S. spy plane and a
Chinese military plane in 2001, and the Japanese
Prime Minister’s controversial visit to the
Yasukuni shrine in 2005.4 Around this time a
significant shift in philosophy began to take place.
Members of the Chinese hacking community that
participated in such attacks soon found that
transitioning to cyber espionage was more
rewarding—both in terms of developing a more
advanced skill set as well as in monetary
remuneration. One group known as NCPH
(Network Crack Program Hacker), whose
founding member “Wicked/Withered Rose” was a
patriotic hacker, made the transition to cyber
espionage by founding a “hacker-for-hire” group

that simultaneously developed an association with
the Chinese military.5 The group began developing
zero-day exploits, rootkits and remote access
tools (RATs)—using them in attacks against a
variety of targets including the U.S. Department of
Defense.6 (One of this group’s associates, “whg”, is
still active and is believed to have developed one
variant of the PlugX/SOGU malware.7) The
rationale behind this transition within the Chinese
hacking community is nicely summed up in a
message by the “Honker Union of China” to its
members in 2010:
What benefit can hacking a Web page bring our
country and the people? It is only a form of
emotional catharsis, please do not launch any
pointless attacks, the real attack is to fatally
damage their network or gain access to their
sensitive information.8
In Iran, the hacking community appears to be
undergoing a similar transformation. While a
variety of Iranian hacker groups had engaged in
politically motivated website defacements, the
emergence of the “Iranian Cyber Army” in 2009
demonstrated “a concentrated effort to promote
the Iranian government’s political narrative
online”.9 They targeted, among others, news
organizations, opposition websites and social
media.10 This marked the beginning of a largescale cyber offensive against the perceived
enemies of the Iranian government.

5

Foreign news and opposition websites are
routinely blocked in Iran, as are the tools that
allow users in Iran to bypass these restrictions.11
One of the key stakeholders in Iran’s Internet
censorship program is the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC), under which the Basij
paramilitary organization operates.
The Basij formed the Basij Cyber Council and
actively recruits hackers in order to develop both
defensive and offensive cyber capabilities.12 There
is increasing evidence to suggest that the hacker
community in Iran is engaged in a transition from
politically motivated defacements and denial of
service attacks to cyber espionage activities. This
model is consistent with the Basij’s recruitment of
paramilitary volunteer hackers to “engage in less
complex hacking or infiltration operations” leaving
the more technical operations to entities over
which they have increasingly direct control.13
As such, the capabilities of threat actors operating
from Iran have traditionally been considered
limited.14 However, the “Shamoon” attacks, which
wiped computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar,
indicate an improvement in capabilities.15 And
unsurprisingly, Iran has reportedly increased its
efforts to improve offensive capabilities after
being targeted by Stuxnet and Flame.16

Attack Vectors
We have observed the Ajax Security Team use a
variety of vectors to lure targets into installing
malicious software and/or revealing login
credentials. These attack vectors include sending
email, private messages via social media, fake login
pages, and the propagation of anti-censorship
software that has been infected with malware.
Spear phishing
During our investigation, we discovered that these
attackers sent targeted emails, as well as private
messages through social media. For example, the
attackers targeted companies in the DIB using a
fake conference page as a lure to trick targets into
installing malicious software. The attackers

registered the domain “aeroconf2014[.]org” in
order to impersonate the IEEE Aerospace
conference—the conference’s actual domain is
aeroconf.org—and sent out an email with the
following information:
From: invite@aeroconf2014[.]org
Subject: IEEE Aerospace Conference 2014
The email encouraged users to visit a fake
conference website owned by the attackers:
Upon visiting the website, visitors were notified
that they must install “proxy” software in order to
access it, which is actually malware.

Conference Website

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

Credential Phishing
The attackers have also used phishing attacks, in
which they set up Web pages to emulate various
services that require security credentials. The
attackers tailored these login pages for specific
targets in the DIB and spoofed a variety of services
such as Outlook Web Access and VPN login pages.
If users attempt to login through these fake Web
pages, the attackers collect their login credentials.
Anti-censorship Tools
All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Iran are
required to implement filtering technology that
censors access to content which the Iranian
government deems unacceptable.17 This content
includes categories such as pornography and

political opposition.18 In response to these
restrictions, Iranians have been increasingly using
software that bypasses such filtering technology.
To counter anti-censorship efforts, Iran has
attempted to block the use of certain software
tools.19 In 2012, researchers found that an
anti-censorship tool that is primarily used by
Internet users in Iran was bundled with malware
and redistributed.20
Our investigation found that malware-laden
versions of legitimate anti-censorship software,
such as Psiphon and Ultrasurf, were distributed to
users Iran and Persian speaking people around the
world.

The “Stealer” Malware
Host-based Indicators and Malware
Functionality
We have observed the Ajax Security Team use a
malware family that they identify simply as ‘Stealer’.
They deliver this malware as a malicious executable
(dropper). The executable is a CAB extractor that
drops the implant IntelRS.exe. This implant, in turn,
drops various other components into C:\
Documents and Settings\{USER}\Application
Data\IntelRapidStart\. The following files are
written to disk in this location:

File

Figure 3: StartBypass
Ordinal

6 www.fireeye.com

The IntelRS.exe is written in .NET and is aptly
named “Stealer”, as it has various data collection
modules. It drops and launches AppTransferWiz.dll
via the following command:
“C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe” “C:\
Documents and Settings\{USER}\Application
Data\IntelRapidStart\AppTransferWiz.dll”,#110
110 is an ordinal that corresponds to “StartBypass”
export in AppTransferWiz.dll.

Functionality

IntelRS.exe

Various stealer components and encryption implementation

DelphiNative.dll

Browser URL extraction, IE Accounts, RDP accounts (Imported by IntelRS.exe)

IntelRS.exe.config

Config containing supported .NET versions for IntelRS.exe

AppTransferWiz.dll

FTP exfiltration (Launched by IntelRS.exe)

RapidStartTech.stl

Base64 encoded config block containing FTP credentials, implant name, decoy name, screenshot
interval and booleans for startup, keylogger and screenshot

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

Data exfiltration is conducted over FTP by
AppTransferWiz.dll, which acts as an FTP client.
This DLL is written in Delphi. There is code to
exfiltrate data over HTTP POST as well, but it is
unused. We also found incomplete code that would
perform SFTP and SMTP exfiltration, which could
be completed in a future version.

•

Takes various screenshots

•

Harvests instant messaging (IM) account
information: GTalk, Pidgin, Yahoo, Skype

•

Tracks credentials, bookmarks and history
from major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera

State is maintained between the stealer
component IntelRS.exe and the FTP component
AppTransferWiz.DLL using a file from the FTP
server “sqlite3.dll”, as well as a global atom
“SQLiteFinish”. IntelRS.exe waits in an indefinite
loop, until AppTransferWiz.DLL defines this state.

•

Collects email account information

•

Extracts installed proxy software
configuration information

•

Harvests data from installed cookies

Once the state is set, IntelRS.exe proceeds to
collect data from various areas in the system as
described below:

IntelRS.exe loads a Delphi component called
DelphiNative.DLL, which implements some
additional data theft functionality for the following:

•

Collects system information: hostname,
username, timezone, IP addresses, open ports,
installed applications, running processes, etc.

•

Internet Explorer (IE) accounts

•

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) accounts

Performs key logging

•

Browser URLs

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

The Stealer component uses common techniques
to acquire credential data. For instance, it loads
vaultcli.DLL and uses various APIs shown below to
acquire RDP accounts from the Windows vault.
Harvested data is encrypted and written to disk on
the local host. The filenames for these encrypted
files follow this naming scheme:
{stolen data type}_{victim system name}_
YYYYMMDD_HHMM.Enc
The {stolen data type} parameter indicates where
the data was harvested from (e.g., a Web browser,
an instant messenger application, installed proxy
software).

Wikipedia. “PBKDF2”.

23

Microsoft. “Rfc2898DeriveBytes Class”.

Analysis of the malware indicates that the data is
encrypted via a Rijndael cipher implementation;
more specifically it uses AES which is a specific set
of configurations of Rijndael. It uses a key size of
256 bytes and block size of 128 bytes, which
conforms to the FIPS-197 specification of
AES-256.21 It utilizes the passphrase ‘HavijeBaba’
and a salt of ‘salam!*%#’ as an input to PBKDF2
(Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to
derive the key and initialization vector for the
encryption.22 This key derivation implementation in
.NET is done using the Rfc2898DeriveBytes
class.23 The passphrase and salt are Persian
language words. “Havij” means “carrot”, “Baba”
means “father”, and “Salam” is a common greeting
that means “Peace”.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

Sample Timeline
We identified 17 droppers during this research,
including:
•

9 samples compiled on 2013-02-17 07:00

Spoofed Installers
Many of the malicious executables (droppers) that
we collected were bundled with legitimate
installers for VPN or proxy software. Examples
include:

•

4 samples compiled on 2009-07-13 23:42

•

•

3 sample compiled on 2013-10-14 06:48

6dc7cc33a3cdcfee6c4edb6c085b869d was
bundled with an installer for Ultrasurf Proxy
software.

•

1 sample compiled on 2013-10-13 09:56

•

The 2009 compile time appears to have been
forged, while the 2013 compile times may be
legitimate.

3d26442f06b34df3d5921f89bf680ee9 was
bundled with an installer for Gerdoovpn
virtual private network software.

•

3efd971db6fbae08e96535478888cff9 was
bundled with an installer for the Psiphon
proxy.

•

288c91d6c0197e99b92c06496921bf2f was
bundled with an installer for Proxifier
software.

In some cases, we found an implant but not the
parent dropper. In total, 22 of the 23 implants that
we identified during our research had unique
compile times ranging from 2013-10-29 until
2014-03-15. We identified two implants that were
both compiled on 2014-3-15 at 23:16. These
compile times appear to be legitimate and coincide
with attempted intrusion activity attributed to
these attackers.

Figure 7: Icon for the Psiphon
Anti-censorship Tool

These droppers were also designed to visually
spoof the appearance of the above applications.
These droppers contained icons used in the
legitimate installers for these programs.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

Process Debug (PDB) Strings
Analysis of the PDB strings seen in the implants
indicates that there may be more than one
developer working on the source code for the
Stealer builder. The following two PDB paths were
seen in the collection of implants that we
collected:
•

d:\svn\Stealer\source\Stealer\Stealer\obj\
x86\Release\Stealer.pdb

•

f:\Projects\C#\Stealer\source\Stealer\
Stealer\obj\x86\Release\Stealer.pdb

These strings indicate that the Stealer source
code was stored in two different paths but not
necessarily on two different computers. The f:\
Projects\ path may be from an external storage
device such as a thumb drive. It is therefore
possible that only one person has access to the
source code, but keeps a separate repository on
an external storage device. Alternatively, the
different file paths could be the result of two
different actors storing their source code in two
different locations.
Builder Artifacts
In nine of the implants that we collected, we found
a consistent portable executable (PE) resource
with a SHA256 of
5156aca994ecfcb40458ead8c830cd66469d5f5
a031392898d323a8d7a7f23d3. This PE
resource contains the VS_VERSION_INFO. In
layman’s terms, this can best be described as the
metadata describing the executable file. This
specific PE resource contained the
following information:
Note the InternalName of ‘Stealer.exe’. This is the
attackers’ name for this malware family.

The “Stealer” Builder and Tools
During our research, we recovered two different
tools used by the members of the Ajax Security
Team in conjunction with targeted intrusion
activities. The first tool, labeled the ‘Stealer Builder’
was compiled on 2014-04-08. This compile date
may indicate that the group is still active.
Upon executing the ‘Stealer Builder’ the user is
presented with an option to load the ‘Builder’ or to
‘Decrypt’ logs generated from a victim and
exfiltrated to a command-and-control (CnC) server
under the groups’ control.

Figure 8: The Stealer Tool

Figure 9: The Stealer Builder

11 www.fireeye.com

The Builder option enables an attacker to
configure a new Stealer backdoor. The user can
configure the new backdoor to connect to a
specific CnC server with a personalized username
and password. The attacker can bind the backdoor
to a legitimate application of his or her choosing, or
they can cloak it with an icon designed to make the
backdoor appear as though it is a legitimate file.
We also noted that the Builder did not allow the
attacker to select a new passphrase or salt used to
encrypt the stolen data. The passphrase
‘HavijeBaba’ and a salt of ‘salam!*%#’ are both
hardcoded into the builder.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

During testing, we observed that backdoors
generated by this Stealer Builder had a timestamp
of 2013-12-19. We had one backdoor in our
repository with this same timestamp. This sample
(MD5 1823b77b9ee6296a8b997ffb64d32d21)
was configured to exfiltrate data to ultrasms[.]ir.
The VS_VERSION_INFO PE resource mentioned
above (SHA256
5156aca994ecfcb40458ead8c830cd66469d5f5
a031392898d323a8d7a7f23d3) is an artifact of
the Stealer builder that we recovered. The builder
generates an executable named IntelRapidStart.
exe. This executable contains the aforementioned
VS_VERSION_INFO PE resource.
We also recovered a tool designed to encode
plaintext into Base64 encoded text or decode

Figure 10: Base64 Encoder

12 www.fireeye.com

Base64 encoded text into plaintext. Members of
the Ajax Security Team likely this use tool to
encode the configuration data seen in
RapidStartTech.stl files. As noted above, the
RapidStartTech.stl contains the backdoor’s FTP
credentials, implant name, decoy name, and
screenshot interval, along with boolean settings for
startup, keylogger, and screenshot plugins.
Encoding and decoding Base64 data is a
straightforward task and the standard Linux
operating system offers a number of command line
tools to achieve this task. The presence of a
Windows-based GUI tool that simplifies encoding
and decoding Base64 data indicates that these
tools may have been developed for less adept
users.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

Command-and-Control Infrastructure
The CnC infrastructure consists of distinct, but
linked, clusters that have targeted both the users
of anti-censorship tools in Iran as well as defense
contractor companies in the U.S.
The first cluster contains the domain used in the
Aerospace Conference attack as well as the
domains used in phishing attacks designed to
capture user credentials:

Figure 11: Ajax Security
Team’s Phishing
Infrastructure

13 www.fireeye.com

The website used in the Aerospace Conference
attack was aeroconf2014[.]org, which is registered
to info@usa.gov[.]us. However, historical WHOIS
information shows that the domain was registered
by keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail[.]com—the same domain
used to register ajaxtm[.]org, the website of the
Ajax Security Team. The same email addresses
were used to register variations of domain names
associated with popular services provided by
companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and
LinkedIn.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

The second cluster comprises the CnC
infrastructure used in the anti-censorship attacks.
The majority of the samples we analyzed connect
to intel-update[.]com and update-mirror[.]com,
which were registered by james.mateo@aim[.]com.
The domain intel-update[.]com resolved to the IP
address 88.150.227.197, which also hosted

Figure 12: Ajax Security
Team’s Stealer CnC
Infrastructure

Figure 13: Overlap between the
phishing and stealer clusters

14 www.fireeye.com

domains registered by osshom@yahoo[.]com, many
of which are consistent with the pattern of
registering domains with associations to Google
and Yahoo services. We also observed crossover
with a sample that connected to both intelupdate[.]com and ultrasms[.]ir, which was
registered by lvlr98@gmail[.]com.

Fireeye: Operation Saffron Rose 2013

These two clusters are linked by a common IP
address (5.9.244.151), which is used by both ns2.
aeroconf2014[.]org and office.windowsessentials[.]tk.
A third cluster of activity was found via analysis of
1d4d9f6e6fa1a07cb0a66a9ee06d624a. This
sample is a Stealer variant that connects to the
aforementioned intel-update[.]com as well as
plugin-adobe[.]com. The domain plugin-adobe[.]
com resolved to 81.17.28.235. Other domains
seen resolving to IP address nearby include the
following:
Aside from the sample connecting to pluginadobe[.]com, we have not discovered any malware
connecting to these domains.

Victimology
During our investigation, we were able to recover
information on 77 victims from one CnC server
that we discovered while analyzing malware
samples that were disguised as anti-censorship
tools. While analyzing the data from the victims, we

•

44 had their timezone set to “Iran Standard
Time” (37 of those also have their language set
to Persian)

•

Of the remaining 33, 10 have Persian
language settings

•

12 have either Proxifier or Psiphon installed
or running (all 12 had a Persian language
setting and all but one had their timezone set
to “Iran Standard Time”)

The largest concentration of victims is in Iran,
based on the premise that Persian language
settings and “Iran Standard Time” correlate the
victim to be geographically located in Iran. As such,
we believe that attackers disguised malware as
anti-censorship tools in order to target the users of
such tools inside Iran as well as Iranian dissidents
outside the country.

Attribution
The Ajax Security Team appears to have been
formed by personas named “HUrr!c4nE!” and
“Cair3x” in 2010.24 Both members were engaged in
website defacements prior to the forming of the
Ajax Security Team, and both were members of
Iranian hacker forums such as ashiyane[.]org and
shabgard[.]org. Other members include “0day”,
“Mohammad PK” and “Crim3r”. The Ajax Security
Team website at ajaxtm[.]org had a Web forum
with at least 236 members. The group published

several exploits for content management systems
and engaged in defacements.25 Initially, the
defacements seemed to be motivated by a desire
to demonstrate the group’s prowess—they even
defaced an Iranian government website.26
However, the group appears to have become
increasingly political. For example, in a blog post in
2012, “Cair3x” announced the targeting of Iran’s
political opponents.

Hacking anti-revolution political and opposition websites
Hello to everyone, After a while of operating underground
and enhancing our company’s projects and getting close to
24 June 2012, and the martyrdom of Ayatollah Dr. Beheshti
and 72 of Imam Khomeini’s (First and Former supreme
leader of Iran) followers, we have planned a project/
initiative to attack anti-revolution and political
websites against the Islamic Republic. And in late hours
of Wednesday, June 24, 2012, we attacked these websites
and defaced them by writing the words “We are young but
we can” on their websites. This is so the enemies of this
country know that the blood of our martyr will never be
in vain and they will always be remembered in the heart
of gallant Iranians.

By March 2010 HUrr!c4nE! was identifying as a member of Ajax Security Team in exploit releases http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17011/ and the
first defacement archived by Zone-H, which lists both HUrr!c4nE! and Cair3x as members was December 2010 http://www.zone-h.org/mirror/

In 2013, the Ajax Security Team, and “HUrr!c4nE!”
in particular, took part in “#OpIsrael” and
“#OpUSA”.27
By early 2014, the Ajax Security Team appears to
have dwindled. There have been no defacements
since December 2013. The website and forum at
ajaxtm[.]org operated by “HUrr!c4nE!”, aka
“k3yv4n”, is no longer active.

“HUrr!c4nE!” has the most open/documented
Internet persona of the Ajax Security Team. He
registered the ajaxtm[.]org domain name using the
email address keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail[.]com. This
was also the email address used to register the
domain aerospace2014[.]org, which was used in
spear phishing attacks against companies in the
U.S. and is linked with malware activity directed at
users of anti-censorship tools in Iran.

“HUrr!c4nE!” features prominently in all the
group’s activities and defacements. Although there
has been a decline in public-facing Ajax Security
Team activity, this coincides with an increase in
malware activity linked to the group’s
infrastructure.
• ~2009—Membership in ashiyane.org and
shabgard.org forums
• 2010 – 2012—Defacements, Release of exploits
for CMS
• 2012 – 2013—Increasing politicization,
participation on #OpIsrael, #OpUSA
• 2013 – 2014—Transition to cyber-espionage
The increasing politicization of the Ajax Security
Team aligns with the timing of their activities
against the perceived enemies of Iran. In addition
to attacking companies in the U.S., they have
targeted domestic users of anti-censorship
technology.
While the objectives of this group are consistent
with Iran’s efforts at controlling political dissent
and expanding offensive cyber capabilities, the
relationship between this group and the Iranian
government remains inconclusive.

For example, the Ajax Security Team could just be
using anti-censorship tools as a lure because they
are popular in Iran, in order to engage in activities
that would be considered traditional cybercrime. In
one case, “HUrr!c4nE!”, using the email address
keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail[.]com, has been flagged for
possible fraud by an online retailer. While
“HUrr!c4nE!” is engaged in operations that align
with Iran’s political objectives, he may also be
dabbling in traditional cybercrime.
This indicates that there is a considerable grey area
between the cyber espionage capabilities of Iran’s
hacker groups and any direct Iranian government
or military involvement.
On the spectrum of state responsibility, these
attacks align with state-encouraged attacks, which
are defined as attacks in which:
Third parties control and conduct the attack, but
the national government encourages them as a
matter of policy.28
Recruiting hackers through this model allows Iran
to influence their activities, and provides the
Iranian government plausible deniability, but a lack
of direct control also means that the groups may be
unpredictable and engage in unsanctioned attacks.

Conclusion

About FireEye

The increased politicization of the Ajax Security
Team, and the transition from nuisance
defacements to operations against internal
dissidents and foreign targets, coincides with
moves by Iran aimed at increasing offensive cyber
capabilities. While the relationship between actors
such as the Ajax Security Team and the Iranian
government is unknown, their activities appear to
align with Iranian government political objectives.

FireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual
machine-based security platform that provides
real-time threat protection to enterprises and
governments worldwide against the next
generation of cyber attacks. These highly
sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent
traditional signature-based defenses, such as
next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and
gateways. The FireEye Threat Prevention Platform
provides real-time, dynamic threat protection
without the use of signatures to protect an
organization across the primary threat vectors and
across the different stages of an attack life cycle.

The capabilities of the Ajax Security Team remain
unclear. This group uses at least one malware
family that is not publicly available. We have not
directly observed the Ajax Security Team use
exploits to deliver malware, but it is unclear if they
or other Iranian actors are capable of producing or
acquiring exploit code.
While the Ajax Security Team’s capabilities remain
unclear, we know that their current operations
have been somewhat successful as measured by
the number of victims seen checking into to an Ajax
Security Team controlled CnC server. We believe
that if these actors continue the current pace of
their operations they will improve their capabilities
in the mid-term.

The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual
execution engine, complemented by dynamic
threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber
attacks in real time. FireEye has over 1,500
customers across more than 40 countries,
including over 100 of the Fortune 500.

We thank Kenneth Geers and Jen Weedon for their support and analysis on
these findings.
