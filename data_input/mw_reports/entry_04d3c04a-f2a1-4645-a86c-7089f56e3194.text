Inside an APT Campaign with Multiple Targets in India and Japan
The number of targeted attacks has dramatically increased. Unlike largely indiscriminate
attacks that focus on stealing credit card and banking information associated with
cybercrime, targeted attacks noticeably differ and are better characterized as “cyber
espionage.” Highly targeted attacks are computer intrusions threat actors stage in rder to
aggressively pursue and compromise specific targets, often leveraging social engineering, in
order to maintain persistent presence within the victim’s network so they can move laterally
and extract sensitive information.
In a typical targeted attack, a target receives a contextually relevant email that encourages a
potential victim to click a link or open a file. The links and files the attackers send contain
malicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software. The exploits’ payload is a
malware that is silently executed on the target’s computer. This exploitation allows the
attackers to take control of and obtain data from the compromised computer. In other cases,
the attackers send disguised executable files, usually compressed in archives that, if
opened, also compromise the target’s computer. The malware connects back to commandand-control (C&C) servers under the attackers’ control from which they can command the
compromised computer to download additional malware and tools that allow them to move
laterally throughout the target’s network. These attacks are, however, not isolated “smashand-grab” incidents but are part of consistent campaigns that aim to establish covert
presence in a target’s network so that information can be extracted as needed.
Targeted attacks are rarely isolated events. In fact, they are constant. It is more useful to
think of them as campaigns—a series of failed and successful attempts to compromise a
target’s network over a certain period of time. The attackers, in fact, often keep track of the
different attacks within a campaign in order to determine which individual attack

compromised a specific victim’s network. As the attackers learn more about their targets from
open source research—relying on publicly available information, as well as previous attacks,
the specificity of the attacks may sharply increase.
Cyber-espionage campaigns often focus on specific industries or communities of interest in
addition to a geographic focus. Different positions of visibility often yield additional sets of
targets pursued by the same threat actors. We have been tracking the campaign dubbed
“Luckycat” and found that in addition to targeting Indian military research institutions, as
previously revealed by Symantec, the same campaign targeted entities in Japan as well as
the Tibetan community.
The Luckycat campaign attacked a diverse set of targets using a variety of malware, some of
which have been linked to other cyber-espionage campaigns. The attackers behind this
campaign maintain a diverse set of C&C infrastructure and leverages anonymity tools to
obfuscate their operations. We were able to track elements of this campaign to hackers
based in China.

Luckycat Quick Profile:
First Seen:
The Luckycat campaign has been active since at least June 2011.
Victims and Targets:
The Luckycat campaign has been linked to 90 attacks against the following industries and/or
communities in Japan and India:
Aerospace
Energy
Engineering
Shipping
Military research
Tibetan activists
Operations:
Targeted emails that are contextually relevant (i.e., emails containing a decoy
document of radiation dose measurement results sent some time after the Great East
Japan Earthquake
Exploited CVE-2010-3333 (aka, Rich Text Format [RTF] Stack Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability) in several instances, although Adobe Reader and Flash Player
vulnerabilities were also exploited
Used TROJ_WIMMIE or VBS_WIMMIE—malware that take advantage of the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI), making the backdoor component undetectable
through file scanning
3/4

The WIMMIE malware, once inside the network, connects to a command-and-control
(C&C) server via HTTP over port 80
Attackers heavily used free web-hosting services but also used virtual private servers
(VPSs) for more stable operations
Possible Indicators of Compromise
WIMMIE malware do not leave much network fingerprint. However, the following is an
identifiable HTTP C&C communication fingerprint—count.php?m=c&n=
[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@. This format can also be seen in
the URL inside the script when /namespace:\\root\subscription path __eventconsumer is
typed in the command line for WMI.
Relationship with Other APT Campaigns
Malware identified with the ShadowNet, Duojeen, Sparksrv, and Comfoo campaigns were
used or found hosted on the same dedicated server used by the LuckyCat campaign.

characteristics highlighted in this APT campaign profile reflect the results of our investigation
as of March 2012
