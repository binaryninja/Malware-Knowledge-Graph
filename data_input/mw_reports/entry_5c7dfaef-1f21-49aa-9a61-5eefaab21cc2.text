Summary & Key Findings
In July and August 2020, government operatives used NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware
to hack 36 personal phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and
executives at Al Jazeera. The personal phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby
TV was also hacked.
The phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call KISMET, which
appears to involve an invisible zero-click exploit in iMessage. In July 2020, KISMET
was a zero-day against at least iOS 13.5.1 and could hack Apple’s then-latest iPhone
11.
Based on logs from compromised phones, we believe that NSO Group customers also
successfully deployed KISMET or a related zero-click, zero-day exploit between
October and December 2019.
The journalists were hacked by four Pegasus operators, including one operator
MONARCHY that we attribute to Saudi Arabia, and one operator SNEAKY KESTREL
that we attribute to the United Arab Emirates.
We do not believe that KISMET works against iOS 14 and above, which includes new
security protections. All iOS device owners should immediately update to the latest
version of the operating system.
Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability
of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections
that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit.

2/19

Infrastructure used in these attacks included servers in Germany, France, UK, and Italy
using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma, and DigitalOcean.
We have shared our findings with Apple and they have confirmed to us they are looking
into the issue.

1. Background
NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware is a mobile phone surveillance solution that enables
customers to remotely exploit and monitor devices. The company is a prolific seller of
surveillance technology to governments around the world, and its products have been
regularly linked to surveillance abuses.
Pegasus became known for the telltale malicious links sent to targets via SMS for many
years. This method was used by NSO Group customers to target Ahmed Mansoor, dozens
of members of civil society in Mexico, and political dissidents targeted by Saudi Arabia,
among others. The use of malicious links in SMSes made it possible for investigators and
targets to quickly identify evidence of past targeting. Targets could not only notice these
suspicious messages, but they could also search their message history to detect evidence of
hacking attempts.
More recently, NSO Group is shifting towards zero-click exploits and network-based attacks
that allow its government clients to break into phones without any interaction from the target,
and without leaving any visible traces. The 2019 WhatsApp breach, where at least 1,400
phones were targeted via an exploit sent through a missed voice call, is one example of such
a shift. Fortunately, in this case, WhatsApp notified targets. However, it is more challenging
for researchers to track these zero-click attacks because targets may not notice anything
suspicious on their phone. Even if they do observe something like “weird” call behavior, the
event may be transient and not leave any traces on the device.
The shift towards zero-click attacks by an industry and customers already steeped in secrecy
increases the likelihood of abuse going undetected. Nevertheless, we continue to develop
new technical means to track surveillance abuses, such as new techniques of network and
device analysis.

iMessage Emerges as a Zero-Click Vector
Since at least 2016, spyware vendors appear to have successfully deployed zero-click
exploits against iPhone targets at a global scale. Several of these attempts have been
reported to be through Apple’s iMessage app, which is installed by default on every iPhone,
Mac, and iPad. Threat actors may have been aided in their iMessage attacks by the fact that
certain components of iMessage have historically not been sandboxed in the same way as
other apps on the iPhone.

3/19

For example, Reuters reported that United Arab Emirates (UAE) cybersecurity company
DarkMatter, operating on behalf of the UAE Government, purchased a zero-click iMessage
exploit in 2016 that they referred to as “Karma,” which worked during several periods in 2016
and 2017. The UAE reportedly used Karma to break into the phones of hundreds of targets,
including the chairmen of Al Jazeera and Al Araby TV.
A 2018 Vice Motherboard report about a Pegasus product presentation mentioned that NSO
Group demonstrated a zero-click method for breaking into an iPhone. While the specific
vulnerable app in that case was not reported, a 2019 Haaretz report interviewed “Yaniv,” a
pseudonym used by a vulnerability researcher working in Israel’s offensive cyber industry,
who seemed to indicate that spyware was sometimes deployed to iPhones via Apple’s Push
Notification Service (APNs), the protocol upon which iMessage is based:
“An espionage program can impersonate an application you’ve downloaded to your
phone that sends push notifications via Apple’s servers. If the impersonating program
sends a push notification and Apple doesn’t know that a weakness was exploited and
that it’s not the app, it transmits the espionage program to the device.”

The Gulf Cooperation Council: A Booming Spyware Market
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is one of the most significant customer bases
for the commercial surveillance industry, with governments reportedly paying hefty premiums
to companies that provide them special services, including analysis of intelligence that they
capture with the spyware. The UAE apparently became an NSO Group customer in 2013, in
what was described as the “next big deal” for NSO Group after its first customer, Mexico. In
2017, Saudi Arabia (which the Citizen Lab calls KINGDOM) and Bahrain (PEARL) appear to
have also become customers of NSO Group. Haaretz has also reported that Oman is an
NSO Group customer, and that the Israeli Government prohibits NSO Group from doing
business with Qatar.

Al Jazeera and the Middle East Crisis
The relationship between Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt (jointly, “the four countries”)
and Qatar is fractious. The four countries often claim that Qatar shelters dissidents from the
four countries and supports political Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood,
whom they view as the most serious challenge to the existing political order in the Middle
East.
In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors and froze
relations with Qatar for eight months. A second crisis occurred on June 5, 2017, when the
four countries cut off diplomatic relations and closed their borders with Qatar. The crisis was
ostensibly precipitated by a fake story planted on the state-run Qatar News Agency (QNA) by

4/19

hackers, which misquoted Qatar’s Emir referring to Iran as “an Islamic power,” and praising
Hamas. According to US intelligence officials speaking with The Washington Post, senior
UAE Government officials approved the QNA hacking operation.
On June 23, 2017, the four countries issued a joint statement which outlined 13 demands to
Qatar, including closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, scaling down ties with Iran, and
shutting down Al Jazeera and its affiliate stations and news outlets.
Al Jazeera: targeted by criticism, hacking & blocking by neighboring countries
Al Jazeera is somewhat distinctive in the Middle East in terms of its media coverage. On
many issues, it presents alternative viewpoints not available from largely state-run media
outlets in the region. Several other attempts at building credible media channels in the GCC
have been met with less success, including Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal’s highly publicized
Bahrain-based Al Arab channel, which was permanently shut down by local authorities on its
first day of operations after airing an interview with a member of Bahrain’s opposition Al
Wefaq political society.
Al Jazeera’s reporting featured prominently in the Arab Spring, where its extensive, real-time
coverage of protests in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya “helped propel insurgent emotions
from one capital to the next.” Leaders of countries neighboring Qatar regularly express deep
concerns about its coverage and in some cases have taken action to limit the availability of
the channel in their countries. In 2017, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE blocked Al Jazeera’s
website.
After the fall of Egypt’s President Mubarak in the Arab Spring, Muslim Brotherhood leader
Mohammed Morsi was elected President of Egypt. This election was considered by Saudi
Arabia and the UAE as a threat and a sign of the expansion of Qatar’s regional influence
because of Qatar’s history of support for the Muslim Brotherhood. However, Morsi was
deposed by a military coup on July 3, 2013 led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and taken to
military custody. One day after the coup, the military shut down a number of news stations in
Egypt, including Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr and Al Jazeera’s bureau in Egypt, and detained
five of the staff.
Although Al Jazeera’s Arabic language coverage of uprisings in neighboring Gulf countries,
including Bahrain, was generally seen as striking a more muted tone than its English
language coverage, the channel was still criticized. For example, Bahrain’s Foreign Minister
famously tweeted the following about a documentary on the channel: “It’s clear that in Qatar
there are those who don’t want anything good for Bahrain. And this film on Al Jazeera
English is the best example of this inexplicable hostility.”

2. The Attacks

5/19

This section describes the hacking of two reporters’ phones, Tamer Almisshal and Rania
Dridi. They are among the 36 reporters and editors targeted in the attack, most of whom
have requested anonymity. Almisshal and Dridi consented to be named in this report and for
the Citizen Lab to describe their targeting in detail.

The 19 July 2020 Attack on Tamer Almisshal
Tamer Almisshal is a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera’s Arabic language
channel, where he anchors the “‫ ”ﻣﺎ ﺧﻔﻲ أﻋﻈﻢ‬program (translated as “this is only the tip of the
iceberg” or “what is hidden is more immense”). Almisshal’s program has reported on a wide
variety of politically sensitive topics in the Middle East, including UAE, Saudi, and Bahraini
Government involvement in an attempted 1996 coup in Qatar, the Bahrain Government’s
hiring of a former Al-Qaeda operative for an assassination program, the Saudi killing of
Jamal Khashoggi, and ties between a powerful member of the UAE’s Royal Family, Sheikh
Mansour Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and UAE businessman B.R. Shetty’s healthcare empire,
which collapsed in 2020 due to alleged fraud and disclosures of hidden debt.

Figure 1: Tamer Almisshal (right) interviews an Istanbul taxi driver who was reportedly hired
by two members of the team that killed Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
Almisshal was concerned that his phone might be hacked, so in January 2020, he consented
to installing a VPN application for Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated
with his Internet traffic.

6/19

7/19

Figure 2: Timeline of 19 July attack on Tamer.
While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website
that we had detected in our Internet scanning as an Installation Server for NSO Group’s
Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus.
Time: 19 July 2020, 11:29 – 11:31 UTC
Domain: 9jp1dx8odjw1kbkt.f15fwd322.regularhours.net
IP: 178.128.163.233
Downloaded: 1.74MB
Uploaded: 211KB
Initial Vector: Apple Servers
We conclude that Almisshal’s phone reached out to the Pegasus Installation Server due to
an apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers. In the 54 minutes before Almisshal’s
phone visited the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed an unusual behavior:
connections to a large number of iCloud Partitions (p*-content.icloud.com). In the more than
3000 hours that we have been monitoring Almisshal’s Internet traffic, we have only seen 258
connections to iCloud Partitions (excluding p20-content.icloud.com, which Almisshal’s phone
uses for iCloud backups), with 228 of these connections (~88%) occurring during a 54
minute period between 10:32 and 11:28 on 19 July.1 On 19 July, we saw no matching
connections prior to 10:32 or after 11:28. The connections in question were to 18 iCloud
partitions (all odd-numbered).

Figure 3: Screenshot of a 19 July packet capture from Almisshal’s phone showing DNS
lookups for iCloud Partitions immediately before a lookup for a Pegasus Installation Server.

8/19

The connections to the iCloud Partitions on 19 July 2020 resulted in a net download of
2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. Because these anomalous iCloud connections
occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation at 11:29 UTC, we believe
they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked. Our analysis
of an infected device (Section 3) indicates that the built-in iOS imagent application was
responsible for one of the spyware processes. The imagent application is a background
process that appears to be associated with iMessage and FaceTime.
Exfiltration
Sixteen seconds after the last connection to the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed
Almisshal’s iPhone communicate for the first time with three additional IPs over the next 16
hours. We never observed his phone communicating with these IPs previously, and have not
observed communications since.

Overall, we observed 270.16MB of upload, and 15.15MB of download, and each IP returned
a valid TLS certificate for bananakick.net. The phone did not set the SNI in the HTTPS Client
Hello message, nor did it perform a DNS lookup for bananakick.net, perhaps an effort to
thwart our previously-reported DNS Cache Probing technique to locate infected devices, or
an effort to thwart anti-Pegasus countermeasures implemented nationwide in Turkey
(Section 4), another popular target of Pegasus operators. Because communications with
these three servers commenced 16 seconds after the communications with a known
Pegasus Installation Server, we suspected that these three IPs were Pegasus command and
control (C&C) servers.
Analysis of Device Logs
Almisshal’s device shows what appears to be an unusual number of kernel panics (phone
crashes) between January and July 2020. While some of the panics may be benign, they
may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device.

A Series of Attacks on Rania Dridi
Rania Dridi is a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV, where she presents the “‫”ﺷﺒﺎﺑﯿﻚ‬
newsmagazine program (translated from Arabic as “windows”), which covers a variety of
current affairs topics.

Figure 4: Rania Dridi reporting on sexual harassment in the Arab world in an episode of
‫ﺷﺒﺎﺑﯿﻚ‬.
While reviewing device logs from Rania Dridi’s iPhone Xs Max, we found evidence that her
phone was hacked at least six times with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware between 26
October 2019 and 23 July 2020. Two of these instances, on 26 October and 12 July, were
likely zero-day exploits, as the phone appears to have been hacked while running the latest
available version of iOS. At the other times Dridi’s phone was hacked, there was a newer
version of iOS available, meaning that there is no evidence one way or the other as to
whether the exploits were zero-days.

operator apparently successfully deployed a zero-day exploit against the same up-to-date
phone, running iOS 13.5.1. The 12 July 2020 attack, and another attack on 23 July 2020
appear to have used the KISMET zero-click exploit.
Network logs show that Dridi’s phone communicated with the following four servers between
13 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 that we attributed to NSO Group operator SNEAKY
KESTREL. No communications were observed between 17 July and 22 July 2020.

We suspect that the attacks on Dridi’s phone in October, November, and December 2019
also used a zero-click exploit, because we saw an NSO Group zero-click exploit deployed
against another iPhone target during this timeframe, and because we found no evidence of
telltale SMS or WhatsApp messages containing Pegasus spyware links on her phone.
Network logs were unavailable for these periods.

4. Other Infections at Al Jazeera
Working with Al Jazeera’s IT team, we identified a total of 36 personal phones inside Al
Jazeera that were hacked by four distinct clusters of servers which could be attributable to
up to four NSO Group operators. An operator that we call MONARCHY spied on 18 phones,

11/19

and an operator that we call SNEAKY KESTREL spied on 15 phones, including one of the
same phones that MONARCHY spied on. Two other operators, CENTER-1 and CENTER-2,
spied on 1 and 3 phones, respectively.
We conclude with medium confidence that SNEAKY KESTREL acts on behalf of the UAE
Government, because this operator appears to target individuals primarily inside the UAE,
and because one target hacked by SNEAKY KESTREL previously received Pegasus links
via SMS that point to the same domain name used in the attacks on UAE activist Ahmed
Mansoor.2

Table 2: Servers used by MONARCHY in Al Jazeera spying.
We considered but view as less likely the hypothesis that MONARCHY and SNEAKY
KESTREL are both linked to the UAE. The UAE Government has been known to target
Saudi activists, and both MONARCHY and SNEAKY KESTREL have been observed
operating in concert in two cases: the case of Al Jazeera, and a case in Turkey, where the
Turkish Computer Emergency Response Team apparently caught both operators at around
the same time (Section 4). However, we are aware of only one phone that was targeted by

12/19

both operators, and we are not aware of any infrastructructure overlap between the two
operators. Additionally, each operator seems to primarily target in a different country,
MONARCHY in Saudi Arabia and SNEAKY KESTREL in the UAE. Both Saudi Arabia and
the UAE are reported to be Pegasus customers.
We are not able to determine the identity of CENTER-1 and CENTER-2, though both appear
to target mainly in the Middle East.

Table 4: Servers used by CENTER-2 in Al Jazeera spying.
We did not observe infection attempts for CENTER-1 and CENTER-2, so we are unsure
which Pegasus Installation Servers were used.
The infrastructure used in these attacks included servers located in Germany, France, UK,
and Italy using cloud hosting providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma, and DigitalOcean.

3. Analysis of Device Logs from a Live Pegasus Infection
We obtained logs from an iPhone 11 device inside Al Jazeera networks while it was infected.
Our analysis indicates that the current Pegasus implant has a number of capabilities
including: recording audio from the microphone including both ambient “hot mic” recording
and audio of encrypted phone calls, and taking pictures. In addition, we believe the implant
can track device location, and access passwords and stored credentials.

13/19

Figure 5: Some Pegasus implant capabilities observed on an infected device.
The phone logs showed a process launchafd on the phone that was communicating with
the four *.crashparadox.net IP addresses in Table 1, which we linked to SNEAKY
KESTREL.
The launchafd process was located in flash memory in the
com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging folder:
/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchafd

This folder appears to be used for iOS updates, and we suspect that it may not survive iOS
updates. It appeared that additional components of the spyware on this device were stored in
a folder with a randomly generated name in /private/var/tmp/ . The contents of the
/private/var/tmp/ folder do not persist when the device is rebooted. The parent process
of launchafd was listed as rs , and was located in flash memory at:
/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/rs

14/19

The imagent process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was
listed as the responsible process for rs , indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage
or FaceTime. The same rs process was also listed as parent of passd , a built-in Apple
app that interfaces with the keychain, as well as natgd , another component of the spyware,
which was located in flash memory at:
/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/natgd

All three processes were running as root . We were unable to retrieve these binaries from
flash memory, as we did not have access to a jailbreak for iPhone 11 running iOS 13.5.1.
The phone’s logs show evidence that the spyware was accessing a variety of frameworks on
the phone, including the Celestial.framework and MediaExperience.framework which could
be used to record audio data and camera, as well as the LocationSupport.framework and
CoreLocation.framework to track the user’s location.

Sharing Findings
We have shared our findings and technical indicators with Apple Inc. which confirms that it is
investigating the issue.

4. Turkish CERT vs. NSO Group
In late 2019, Turkey’s Government-run Computer Emergency Response Team (USOM)
appears to have observed Pegasus attacks involving both MONARCHY and SNEAKY
KESTREL, and sinkholed some domain names used by these operators on a national level.
USOM publishes a “list of malicious links” (“zararlı bağlantılar”) available on their website.
The list of indicators includes domain names, URLs, as well as IP addresses. Turkish ISPs
generally redirect their subscribers who try to access indicators on this list to a USOM
sinkhole IP address (88.255.216.16).

Figure 6: A Sandvine PacketLogic device on Turk Telekom’s network injects an HTTP
redirect to USOM’s sinkhole in response to a request directed at a Pegasus C&C server.
Each ISP appears to implement this sinkholing using the same technique they use to
implement website censorship. For example, Turk Telekom appears to use their Sandvine
PacketLogic devices to inject HTTP redirects for elements on the USOM list, whereas
Vodafone Turkey appears to use its DNS tampering system, returning the USOM IP in
response to any request for a domain name on the list.

15/19

Figure 7: A Vodafone Turkey DNS server responds to our lookup for an unpublished
MONARCHY Pegasus C&C domain name with USOM’s sinkhole IP address.
It is clear that USOM has a particular interest in Pegasus, as all Pegasus domain names
published in three Amnesty reports about Pegasus were added to the USOM list after
Amnesty’s publication.4

Turkish CERT Sinkholes Pegasus Domains
On 5 November 2019, USOM added the following NSO Group Pegasus domain names and
IP addresses to their list of malicious links. We attribute these domains and IPs to
MONARCHY and SNEAKY KESTREL. These indicators were not previously published in
any other location that we can identify, and the USOM list indicates that the source of the
domains and IPs was one of Turkey’s SOMEs (institutional computer emergency response
teams (CERTs) for government agencies and industries).

Figure 8: Pegasus domain names and IP addresses on USOM’s list of malicious links.
We suspect that USOM’s information about the Pegasus infrastructure came from observing
specific infections, as opposed to a broader compromise of NSO Group, or a broader effort
to fingerprint NSO Group traffic within Turkey. Several other operators that appeared to be
spying inside Turkey with Pegasus at the time did not have their infrastructure sinkholed.
We are not aware which individuals were targeted in the attacks observed by the Turkish
Government that triggered the sinkholing. However, a 2019 Reuters report mentions that, in
2016 and 2017, the UAE used the “Karma” exploit to hack hundreds of individuals around
the world, including the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister.5

16/19

One of the IP addresses added to the USOM list on 5 November 2019 appears to have been
abandoned by NSO Group on 28 October 2019, suggesting that at least some of the attacks
observed by Turkey occurred prior to 28 October. Interestingly, despite the fact that
regularhours.net and holdmydoor.com appeared on a Turkish CERT list in November 2019,
we observed MONARCHY and SNEAKY KESTREL continue to use these domain names in
attacks through August 2020.

5. Discussion: The Spyware Industry is Going Dark
When authoritarian governments are enabled by commercial spyware companies like NSO
Group, and emboldened by the belief that they are acting in secret, they target critical voices
like journalists. Unfortunately, it is increasingly difficult to track such cases.
The spyware industry does business in secret, and major spyware sellers invest heavily in
fighting regulation and avoiding legal accountability. Yet, certain industry realities and
technical limitations have historically made it possible to track infections. For example, for
many years all but the most sophisticated commercially available spyware required some
user interaction, such as opening a document or clicking a link, to infect a device.
The deception involved in tricking a target into becoming a victim left traces even after
successful infections. These traces—especially messages used to seed spyware—have
been an invaluable source of evidence for investigators. Over the years, by gathering and
examining the ruses used to deliver spyware, often aided by victims themselves, it has been
possible to identify hundreds of victims.
The current trend towards zero-click infection vectors and more sophisticated anti-forensic
capabilities is part of a broader industry-wide shift towards more sophisticated, less
detectable means of surveillance. Although this is a predictable technological evolution, it
increases the technological challenges facing both network administrators and investigators.
While it is still possible to identify zero-click attacks—as we have done here—the technical
effort required to identify cases markedly increases, as does the logistical complexity of
investigations. As techniques grow more sophisticated, spyware developers are better able
to obfuscate their activities, operate unimpeded in the global surveillance marketplace, and
thus facilitate the continued abuse of human rights while evading public accountability.

Journalists Increasingly Targeted With Spyware
Counting the 36 cases revealed in this report, there are now at least fifty publicly known
cases of journalists and others in media targeted with NSO spyware, with attacks observed
as recently as August 2020. We have previously identified over a dozen journalists and civic
media targeted with NSO Group’s spyware. Amnesty International has identified still more
targeting, as recently as January 2020.

The Al Jazeera attacks are part of an accelerating trend of espionage against journalists and
news organizations. The Citizen Lab has documented digital attacks against journalists by
threat actors from China, Russia, Ethiopia, Mexico, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, among
others. Other research groups have documented similar trends, which appear to be
worsening with the COVID-19 pandemic. Often these attacks parallel more more traditional
forms of media control, and in some cases physical violence.
The increased targeting of the media is especially concerning given the fragmented and
often ad-hoc security practices and cultures among journalists and media outlets, and the
gap between the scale of threats and the security resources made available to reporters and
newsrooms. These concerns are likely particularly acute for independent journalists in
authoritarian states who, despite the fact that they play a crucial role in reporting information
to the public, may be forced to work in dangerous conditions with even fewer security tools at
their disposal than their peers in large news organizations.
Progress, But New Perils
Journalist security has attracted recent research interest, grantmaking, and practice
innovation. Progress is showing in many areas. However, the zero-click techniques used
against Al Jazeera staff were sophisticated, difficult to detect, and largely focused on the
personal devices of reporters. Security awareness and policies are essential, but without
substantial investment in security, network analysis, regular security audits and collaboration
with researchers like the Citizen Lab these cases would not have been detected.
Journalists and media outlets should not be forced to confront this situation on their own.
Investments in journalist security and education must be accompanied by efforts to regulate
the sale, transfer, and use of surveillance technology. As the anti-detection features of
spyware become more sophisticated, the need for effective regulatory and oversight
frameworks becomes increasingly urgent. The abuse of NSO Group’s zero-click iMessage
attack to target journalists reinforces the need for a global moratorium on the sale and
transfer of surveillance technology, as called for by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, “until rigorous
human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices and guarantee that
governments and non-State actors use the tools in legitimate ways.”
These safeguards should include strengthening and expanding regional and international
export controls, enacting national legislation that constrains invasive new surveillance
technology such as zero-click spyware, and the expansion of mandatory due diligence
requirements for spyware developers and brokers.

Update your iOS Device Immediately

We have seen no evidence that the KISMET exploit still functions on iOS 14 and above,
although we are basing our observations on a finite sample of observed devices. Apple
made many new security improvements with iOS 14 and we suspect that these changes
blocked the exploit. Although we believe that NSO Group is constantly working to develop
new vectors of infection, if you own an Apple iOS device you should immediately update
to iOS 14. Click here for instructions.
