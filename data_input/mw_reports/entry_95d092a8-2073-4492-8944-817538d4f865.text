KGB’s successor agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB) is behind a historic global
campaign targeting critical national infrastructure
long list of cyber operations includes UK energy sector, US aviation and a Russian
dissident in the UK targeted using sophisticated hacking and spear-phishing
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss sanctions a Russian MOD subsidiary for carrying out
malicious cyber activity on a Saudi petro-chemical plant
The UK, together with the US and other allies, has today (Thursday 24 March) exposed
historic malign cyber activity of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) - the successor
agency to the KGB.
One month on since Putin’s unprovoked and illegal war in Ukraine started, the global scope
of the FSB’s Centre 16 cyber campaign has been revealed.
The National Cyber security Centre (NCSC) assess it is almost certain that the FSB’s Centre
16 are also known by their hacker group pseudonyms of ‘Energetic Bear’, ‘Berserk Bear’ and
‘Crouching Yeti’, and conducted a malign programme of cyber activity, targeting critical IT
systems and national infrastructure in Europe, the Americas and Asia. They have today been
indicted by the FBI for targeting the systems controlling the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant
in Kansas, US in 2017 but failed to have any negative impact.
Separately, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has used the UK’s cyber sanctions regime to
designate a Russian defence ministry subsidiary, the Central Scientific Research Institute of
Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM), for an incident involving safety override controls in a
Saudi petro-chemicals plant in 2017.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:
1/3

Russia’s targeting of critical national infrastructure is calculated and dangerous. It
shows Putin is prepared to risk lives to sow division and confusion among allies.
We are sending a clear message to the Kremlin by sanctioning those who target
people, businesses and infrastructure. We will not tolerate it.
We will continue to work together with our allies to turn the ratchet and starve Putin’s
war machine of its funding and resources.
The malware used against the petro-chemical plant was designed specifically to target the
plant’s safety override for the Industrial Control System and resulted in 2 emergency
shutdowns of the plant.
The malware was designed to give the actors complete control of infected systems and had
the capability to cause significant impact, possibly including the release of toxic gas or an
explosion - either of which could have resulted in loss of life and physical damage to the
facility.
The FSB’s long raft of malign cyber activity includes:
targeting UK energy companies
sustained and substantial scanning and probing of networks in the American aviation
sector, and exfiltration of data in aviation and other key US targets
posing as the Russian Federal Tax Service to conduct spear-phishing attacks against
Russian nationals
attempting to spear-phish the press secretary of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy, a UK-based
longstanding critic of the Kremlin, and monitoring a website he set up to expose
corruption in the Russian government
These sanctions follow a further 65 oligarchs and banks targeted earlier today by the Foreign
Secretary, bringing the UK’s sanctions on those who enable Putin’s war to more than £500
billion worth of bank assets and £150 billion in personal net worth.
