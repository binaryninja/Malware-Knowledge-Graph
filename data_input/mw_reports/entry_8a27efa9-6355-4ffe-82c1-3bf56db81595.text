The Cybereason Nocturnus Team reported a spike in the activity of
the Iran-linked APT group APT35 (aka Phosphorus or Charming
Kitten).
The Cybereason Nocturnus Team observed a spike in the activity of the Iran-linked APT
group APT35 (aka ‘Charming Kitten‘, ‘Phosphorus‘, Newscaster, and Ajax Security Team)
The Phosphorus group made the headlines in 2014 when experts at iSight issued
a report describing the most elaborate net-based spying campaign organized by Iranian
hackers using social media.
Microsoft has been tracking the threat actors at least since 2013, but experts believe that
the cyberespionage group has been active since at least 2011.
The APT group previously targeted medical research organizations in the US and Israel in
late 2020, and for targeting academics from the US, France, and the Middle East region in
2019.
They have also previously targeted human rights activists, the media sector, and interfered
with the US presidential elections.

The APT35 group is now deploying a new PowerShell backdoor called PowerLess Backdoor
using a stealthy technique to avoid detection. The group is running the PowerShell Backdoor
in a .NET context rather than spawning the PowerShell process.
Below is the capabilities supported by the PowerLess backdoor:
Encrypted channel with the C2
Executing arbitrary commands
Killing processes
Stealing browser data
Keylogging
Experts noticed a lot of typos and grammatical mistakes in the code of the backdoor, a
circumstance that suggests that the native language of the backdoor’s authors is likely not
English.
“It is worth mentioning that the backdoor is being run within a .NET context, so therefore it
does not spawn “powershell.exe”.” reads the analysis published by the researchers. “This
behavior can be interpreted as an attempt to evade certain PowerShell detections, although
PowerShell logs are being saved on the machine” “Oddly enough, there is a part of the code
in the PowerLess Backdoor, that do spawn a powershell.exe process, when the request to
kill a process is received from the C2”
The toolset analyzed by Cybereason includes modular, multi-staged malware used to deploy
additional payloads. The attackers also used previously undetected malware, including info
stealers and keyloggers.
In Mid-January, the Iran-linked APT35 group has been observed leveraging the Log4Shell
flaw to drop a new PowerShell backdoor tracked as CharmPower.
Cybereason also found evidence that links the APT group to the Memento
Ransomware operations that first appeared in the threat landscape in 2021.
The gang was observed exploiting the CVE-2021-21972 vulnerability in VMware vCenter
Server for the initial access to target networks.
In October, Sophos researchers have spotted the Memento ransomware that adopts a
curious approach to block access to victims’ files. The ransomware copies files into
password-protected WinRAR archives, it uses a renamed freeware version of the legitimate
file utility WinRAR. The Memento ransomware then encrypts the password and deletes the
original files from the victim’s system.
Experts found multiple similarities between TTPs used by Phosphorus and the Memento
ransomware operation and attack infrastructure.

“Another IP that appears in US CERT’s list is 91.214.124[.]143. Searching it in VirusTotal
reveals other malicious files communicating with it, as well as unique URL directory patterns
that reveal a potential connection to Memento Ransomware.” concludes the report. “The
activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same time frame as
Memento. Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to ransomware during that
period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is operated by an Iranian threat
actor.”
