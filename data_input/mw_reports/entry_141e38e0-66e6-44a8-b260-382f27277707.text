Executive Overview
Neshta is an older file infector that is still prevalent in the wild. It was initially observed in
2003 and has been previously associated with BlackPOS malware. It prepends malicious
code to infected files. This threat is commonly introduced into an environment through
unintentional downloading or by other malware. It infects Windows executable files and may
attack network shares and removable storage devices.
In 2018 Neshta predominantly targeted the manufacturing industry, but attacked the finance,
consumer goods, and energy sectors as well. To achieve persistence Neshta renames itself
to svchost.com then modifies the registry so it runs each time an .exe file is launched. This
threat is known to collect system information and use POST requests to exfiltrate data to
attacker-controlled servers. The Neshta binaries used in our analysis did not demonstrate
the data exfiltration behaviour or functionality.

Technical Analysis
This section describes the symptoms of a Neshta infection. We picked samples of the
Neshta virus uploaded to VirusTotal in 2007, 2008, and 2019.
We analyzed files with these SHA-256 hashes:

Static File Analysis
Neshta’s code is compiled by Boland Delphi 4.0. The file size is usually 41,472 bytes.
As any Delphi binary, Neshta has four writable sections (DATA, BSS, .idata, and .tls) and
three sharable sections (.rdata, .reloc, and .rsrc):

In addition, Neshta code displays interesting fingerprint strings - see Figure 2, below:
“Delphi-the best. F*** off all the rest. Neshta 1.0 Made in Belarus. Прывiтанне усiм
~цiкавым~ беларус_кiм дзяучатам. Аляксандр Рыгоравiч, вам таксама :) Восенькепская пара... Алiварыя - лепшае пiва! Best regards 2 Tommy Salo. [Nov-2005] yours

The Belarusian strings say: “ Hello everyone ~ ~ interesting belarus_kim girls. Alexander G.,
you too :) osen- bad couple ... Alivaryya - the best beer!”

File Infection
Neshta’s main feature is its file infector which searches local drives for .exe files. Neshta
targets “.exe” files making exceptions for the ones that contain any of the following strings in
their short path:
%Temp%
%SystemRoot% (usually C:\Windows)
\PROGRA~1\
The infection flow summary is described below and shown in Figure 3.
Neshta:
1. Reads 41,472 (0xA200) bytes from the beginning of target original file.
2. Creates two sections and allocates memory with the attribute of PAGE_READWRITE
on the original file’s beginning and bottom.

3. Inserts its malicious header and code at the beginning of the original file. The written
data is 41,472 bytes.
4. Writes the encoded original header and code to the file, which is 41,472 bytes in size.
These actions enable the malicious code to launch as soon as the infected file is executed:

Figure 3: File Infection
When the infected file is executed, the original program is dropped into %Temp%\3582-490\
<filename> and run by the WinExec API.

Persistence
Neshta drops itself to C:\Windows\svchost.com and installs itself into the registry using the
following parameters:
Registry key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\exefile\shell\open\command
Registry value: (Default)
Value: %SystemRoot%\svchost.com "%1" %*
This registry change directs the system to run Neshta each time an .exe file is launched. The
"%1" %* points to the launched .exe file. In addition, Neshta creates a named mutex to check
for the existence of another running instance:
MutexPolesskayaGlush*.*<0x90>svchost.com<0x90>exefile\shell\open\command‹À "%1"
%*œ‘@
Another dropped file is “directx.sys” which is sent to %SystemRoot%. This is a text file (not a
kernel driver) which contains the path of the last infected file to run. It is updated every time
an infected file is executed.

BlackBerry Cylance Stops Neshta
BlackBerry Cylance uses artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on
millions of both safe and unsafe files. Our automated security agents block Neshta based on
countless file attributes and malicious behaviors instead of relying on a specific file signature.
BlackBerry Cylance, which offers a predictive advantage over zero-day threats, is trained on
and effective against both new and legacy cyberattacks. For more information, visit
