Executive Summary
Pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) is conducting a campaign of DDoS
attacks on Ukraine and NATO organizations that began in the early days of the war in
Ukraine. Targets have included government organizations and critical infrastructure.
NoName057(16) was responsible for disrupting services across the financial sector of
Denmark this week. Other recent attacks include organizations and businesses across
Poland, Lithuania and others.
On January 11th, we observed NoName057(16) begin targeting 2023 Czech
presidential election candidates’ websites.
SentinelLabs has identified how the group operates over public Telegram channels, a
volunteer-fueled DDoS payment program, a multi-OS supported toolkit, and GitHub.

What is NoName057(16)

1/12

NoName057(16), also known as NoName05716, 05716nnm or Nnm05716, is a relatively
underreported hacktivist group supporting Russia since March 2022, alongside Killnet and
other pro-Russian groups. In December 2022, the group was responsible for disrupting the
Polish government website. As noted by the Polish government, the incident was in
response to the Sejm of the Republic of Poland officially recognizing Russia as a state
sponsor of terrorism in mid December 2022. More recently, the group targeted the Danish
financial sector, impacting leading financial institutions as reported by Reuters.

Motivations and Objectives
The NoName057(16) group is primarily focused on disrupting websites important to nations
critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks act as
the method to conduct such disruption efforts.
Initial attacks focused on Ukrainian news websites, while later shifting to NATO associated
targets. For example, the first disruption the group claimed responsibility for were the March
2022 DDoS attacks on Ukraine news and media websites Zaxid, Fakty UA, and others.
Overall the motivations center around silencing what the group deems to be anti-Russian.

Operating Methods – Telegram Channel
NoName057(16) operate through Telegram to claim responsibility for their attacks, mock
targets, make threats, and generally justify their actions as a group. Interestingly,
NoName057(16) makes attempts to teach their followers through educational content such
as explaining basic industry jargon and attack concepts.
With an average of six posts per day, the overall engagement of NoName057(16)’s Telegram
efforts has slowly declined over time. Peak viewership of their posts occurred in July 2022,
when they reached approximately 14,000 readers with nearly 100% engagement rate. Today,
daily average reach is roughly 2-3,000 and engagement in the range of 10-20%, signifying
that the group is becoming less relevant to their followers and to Telegram users as a whole.
This may be explained in part by the fact that many similar hacktivist groups exist, have
gained more attention, and are often more impactful in their objectives.

Views and engagement rate of NoName057(16) Telegram Posts (telemetr.io)
Evidence from NoName057(16)’s Telegram channel indicates that the group values the
recognition their attacks achieve through being referenced online including in Wikipedia
articles. The channel also posts pro-Russian memes, motivational posts, and general status
updates around the holidays. The observed Telegram activity makes it clear that the group
considers itself a top tier Russian threat actor when in reality the impact of their DDoS
attacks is short-lived disruption with little to no wider consequence.

Tool Hosting on GitHub
3/12

The group has also made use of GitHub to host a variety of illicit activity. This includes using
GitHub Pages for freely hosting their DDoS tool website dddosia.github[.]io, and the
associated GitHub repositories for hosting the latest version of their tools as advertised in the
Telegram channel. Two GitHub profiles of interest are dddosia and kintechi341. Early
commits to the ddos_config repo were made in the name of “Роман Омельченко”.

We reported the abuse of these services to the GitHub Trust & Safety team, who quickly took
action as a violation of GitHub’s Terms of Service.

Network
The C2 services are primarily hosted through Neterra, the Bulgarian telecommunications
organization, while also making use of No-IP Dynamic DNS services. The current C2 is
zig35m48zur14nel40[.]myftp.org at 31.13.195.87. This server is active as of this release.

Targets
Throughout the life of the group, NoName057(16) has focused on targeting Ukraine and
NATO member countries. Organizations targeted are commonly critical infrastructure sectors
whose operations are vital to the target nation.
Target selection shifts according to current political events. As previously noted, the Polish
government was a December target following the Sejm of the Republic of Poland officially
recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in mid December 2022. At the start of
January 2023, a large focus was placed on targeting Lithuanian organizations, primarily in
the cargo and shipping sectors. Most recently the actor began focusing on targeting leading
Danish financial institutions including Danske Bank, Danmarks Nationalbank, and others
reported in the media this week.
On January 11th 2023, we observed the actor begin targeting websites owned by multiple
2023 Czech presidential election candidates. The election is occurring on January 13th and
14th 2023, so timing of the disruption efforts can not be ignored. Specific targets include
domains for candidates Pavel Fischer, Marek Hilšer, Jaroslav Bašta, General Petr Pavel, and
Danuše Nerudová. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic website
was also targeted at the same time. We have notified Czech CERT upon discovery of the
new target list.

Attack Toolkit
NoName057(16) has made use of a number of different tools to conduct their attacks
throughout 2022. In September, Avast reported on the threat actor using the Bobik botnet to
conduct their DDoS attacks. However, the group appears to primarily seek participation
voluntarily through their DDOSIA tool – also referred to by its developer as Dosia and Go
Stresser, depending on versioning.
We analyzed two different implementations of DDOSIA: a Python and a Golang
implementation. The Python DDOSIA implementation is delivered as a PyInstaller package.
The Golang implementation refers to itself internally as Go Stresser.

The internal DDOSIA reference Go Stresser
DDOSIA is a multi-threaded application that conducts denial-of-service attacks against target
sites by repeatedly issuing network requests. DDOSIA issues requests as instructed by a
configuration file that the malware receives from a C2 server when started. The configuration
file is in JSON format and resides at the /client/get_targets URL path on the C2 server.
Historical configuration files can be reviewed in archived October and December 2022 server
responses.

DDOSIA

configuration file (a snippet)
For each target site, the configuration file specifies:
A unique target identifier in the field id.
Target network endpoint information in the fields host, address, and port – a
hostname, an IP address, and a port.
A network request type and method pairs in the fields type and method. The DDOSIA
samples and configuration files we analyzed indicate that the malware supports the
request types http, http2, and tcp, and the request methods – HTTP verbs – GET and
POST (for the request types http or http2) and syn (for the request type tcp). Based on
a configured type and method, DDOSIA constructs HTTP or TCP network packets
(requests) for sending to a target site.
A URL path and request body in the fields path and body for network requests of type
http or http2. If the path and/or body fields have values, DDOSIA constructs and
issues requests with the configured request body to the configured URL path at the
target site.

DDOSIA replaces $_{number} substrings specified in the configuration file with random
values that the malware generates when constructing a network request. In a DDOSIA
configuration file, $_{number} substrings are typically placed in path fields. The Python
implementation of DDOSIA uses templates defined in the randoms field in the configuration
file for generating random string values.

A DDOSIA configuration file specifies URL paths and request bodies that are valid at the
respective target sites. This indicates that the DDOSIA operators construct configuration files
by first exploring target sites. For example, the URL

https://www.defensie[.]nl/actueel/nieuws?pagina={number} is a valid news page

iterator at the website of the Dutch Ministry of Defense.

Ministry of Defense
There are additional DDOSIA features to those above that a configuration file may instruct
the malware to enable. For example, the use_random_user_agent field instructs DDOSIA to
randomly select a user agent from a list of predefined user agents when constructing an
HTTP request. Also, the fields activate_by_schedule, started_at and finished_at
indicate that a DDOSIA sample can be configured to schedule the sending of network
requests over specific date-time intervals. The samples we analyzed do not make use of
these configuration parameters but repeatedly send network requests to each target site until
terminated.

Predefined DDOSIA user agents
We note that there are differences regarding what configuration values and features are
supported by different DDOSIA builds and implementations. This indicates that DDOSIA is
under continuous development and is subject to frequent changes.
For example, the Golang DDOSIA implementations we analyzed support the network
request type http2, whereas their Python counterparts do not implement this support.

http2 network request type
In addition, Golang DDOSIA implementations authenticate themselves to C2 servers by
issuing an HTTP POST request to the /login_new URL path at the servers and terminate if
the authentication fails. The Python DDOSIA implementations that we analyzed do not
support this feature.

DDOSIA authenticates itself to a C2 server (‘Авторизация пройдена успешно’ translates
from Russian to ‘Authorization completed successfully’)
DDOSIA maintains statistics about its operation and success rate – the malware counts the
total and the number of successful network requests sent to each target site. In the context
of network requests of type http or http2, a request is considered successful if the target
site returns the HTTP code 200 (OK).

DDOSIA sends the statistics to the C2 server at regular time intervals – this informs the
DDOSIA operators about the overall progress and success of the denial-of-service campaign
that the malware conducts. This is likely associated with how the group makes use of a
volunteer profit program. They distribute cryptocurrency to the top DDoS contributors,
encouraging people to contribute more technical resources for a more powerful attack.
Versions of the tool for macOS and Linux have also been developed. Android versions of the
tool can also be found; however, the primary distribution of the group has not officially
supported mobile.

Conclusion
NoName057(16) is yet another hacktivist group to emerge following the war in Ukraine.
While not technically sophisticated, they can have an impact on service availability– even
when generally short lived. What this group represents is an increased interest in volunteerfueled attacks, while now adding in payments to its most impactful contributors. We expect
such groups to continue to thrive in today’s highly contentious political climate.
We would like to thank GitHub’s Trust & Safety team for a quick response following our
abuse notification. The actors’ accounts and pages are no longer online.
