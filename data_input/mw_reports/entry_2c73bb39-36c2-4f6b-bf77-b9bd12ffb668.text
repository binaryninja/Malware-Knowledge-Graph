The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) issues Cybereason Threat Analysis reports to
inform on impacting threats. The Threat Analysis reports investigate these threats and provide practical
recommendations for protecting against them.
In this Threat Analysis report, the GSOC investigates recent attack campaigns that reflect the current
developments of the ITG23 threat group (also known as the TrickBot Gang or Wizard Spider). The ITG23 group is
partnering with the TA551 (Shathak) threat group to distribute ITG23’s TrickBot and BazarBackdoor malware,
which malicious actors use to deploy ITG23’s Conti ransomware on compromised systems.

Key Findings
Beware of Shathak Emails: In partnership with the ITG23 threat group, the Shathak threat group
distributes ITG23’s TrickBot and BazarBackdoor malware as password-protected archive files
attached to phishing emails. The archive files contain malicious documents whose macros download
and execute the TrickBot or BazarBackdoor malware. Malicious actors actively use this malware to
deploy ITG23’s Conti ransomware on compromised systems.
Average Two Days Time-to-Ransom (TTR): Conti actors do not deploy ransomware immediately
after initial infection using the TrickBot or BazarBackdoor malware—the actors first conduct other
activities, such as reconnaissance, credential theft, and data exfiltration. We observed an average
TTR of approximately two days after initial infection.
Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform detects and prevents infections that use
the TrickBot and BazarBackdoor malware that the Shathak threat group distributes, as well as
malicious activities that Conti actors conduct.
Cybereason Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The Cybereason GSOC has zero tolerance
towards attacks that involve ransomware, such as the Conti ransomware, and categorizes such
attacks as critical, high-severity incidents. The Cybereason GSOC MDR team issues a
comprehensive report to customers when such an incident occurs. The report provides an in-depth
overview of the incident, which helps to scope the extent of compromise and the impact on the
customer’s environment. In addition, the report provides attribution information when possible, as well
as recommendations for mitigating and isolating the threat.

Introduction
The threat group TA551, also known as Shathak, is an email-based malware distributor that distributes malware
through phishing emails. Shathak has distributed a variety of malware, predominantly malware with informationstealing capabilities, such as Ursniff and Valak in 2020, and the IcedID malware after mid-July 2020.
In October 2021, the IBM X-Force reported that the threat group ITG23, also known as the TrickBot Gang or
Wizard Spider, had partnered with Shathak at some time around July 2021 to distribute the TrickBot and the
BazarBackdoor (also referred to as BazarLoader) malware. ITG23 develops and maintains TrickBot and
BazarBackdoor. TrickBot and BazarBackdoor can deploy additional malware on compromised systems. TrickBot
is a feature-rich and modular malware that has been present on the threat landscape since 2016.
The implementation of TrickBot has evolved over the years, with recent versions of TrickBot implementing
malware-loading capabilities. TrickBot has played a major role in many attack campaigns conducted by different
threat actors, from common cybercriminals to nation-state actors. These campaigns have often involved the
deployment of ransomware such as the Ryuk ransomware.
Since March 2021, malicious actors have been using TrickBot and BazarBackdoor to deploy the Conti
ransomware on compromised systems. The ITG23 threat group originally developed and now maintains the Conti
ransomware. ITG23 uses the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, according to which the developers of the
ransomware pay the operators of the ransomware a wage for a successful attack, or a percentage of ransom
payments.

Conti actors, or Conti ransomware operators, have proven to be a substantial threat by compromising
organizations where IT outages can have life-threatening consequences, such as hospitals and law enforcement
agencies. In September 2021, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the US
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that more than 400 Conti ransomware attacks had taken place on
U.S. and international organizations. Conti actors frequently use a double extortion tactic: if the victim refuses to
pay for data decryption, the malicious actor threatens to leak the data or sell it for profit.
This report discusses recent attack campaigns that reflect the current developments of ITG23 partnering with
Shathak to distribute the TrickBot and BazarBackdoor malware, which malicious actors use to deploy the Conti
ransomware on compromised systems. To this end, the report first provides an overview of a system infection
using the TrickBot or BazarBackdoor malware that the Shathak group distributes, based on recent Shatak
malware distribution campaigns that we analyzed.
The report then discusses Conti actor activities that are common across recent Conti actor attack campaigns that
we analyzed. We focus on activities that Conti actors conduct after establishing a foothold in a system using
BazarBackdoor or TrickBot and before ransomware deployment. A previous report by the Cybereason Nocturnus
team documents the execution of the Conti ransomware.

Analysis
A Successful Partnership: Shathak and the TrickBot Gang
The figure below depicts a typical infection using the ITG23’s TrickBot or the BazarBackdoor malware that the
Shathak group distributes:

A typical infection using the TrickBot or the BazarBackdoor malware
The Shathak group distributes TrickBot and BazarBackdoor through malicious documents, such as Microsoft
Word documents. Shathak stores malicious documents in password-protected archive files and attaches the
archive files to phishing emails. A typical malicious document contains a macro, which a user can execute by
opening the document and enabling macro execution.

3/16

The macro drops a Microsoft Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Applications (HTA) file on the file system and
then executes the file using the mshta.exe Windows utility. Malicious actors use mshta.exe to execute malicious
HTA files and bypass application control solutions that do not account for the malicious use of the Windows utility.
An HTA file that we analyzed, named boxDeling.hta, has two main components: a base-64 encoded code stored
in the <div> section of the boxDeling.hta file with an ID of mainSetDel, and a VBScript script that executes the
encoded code:

Platform

The content of boxDeling.hta: base-64 encoded code and a VBScript script that executes the encoded code
The base-64 encoded code is a JavaScript script that the malicious actors have obfuscated by using the string
reversal technique. The JavaScript script conducts the following activities:
Contacts the attacker-controlled endpoint airloweryd.com, located in Germany, and downloads the
TrickBot malware in the form of a dynamic-link library (DLL) file. The JavaScript script in other HTA
files may contact a different endpoint and download another malware, such as BazarBackdoor.
Stores the downloaded DLL file as the boxDelInt.jpg file in the Public directory, such as
C:\users\Public\.
Executes boxDelInt.jpg—the TrickBot malware—using the regsvr32.exe Windows utility. The
JavaScript script executes regsvr32.exe using the WshShell object of the Windows Script Host object
model:

In recent Shathak malware distribution campaigns that we analyzed, the attacker-controlled endpoints from which
malicious HTA files downloaded malware were primarily located in European countries, with the Netherlands and
Slovakia at the top of the list.
Malicious actors use the TrickBot or BazarBackdoor malware that the Shathak group distributes to deploy
additional malware, such as the Conti ransomware. In recent Conti actor attacks that we analyzed, we observed
that Conti actors do not deploy ransomware immediately after initial compromise using TrickBot or

BazarBackdoor.
The actors first conduct other activities, such as reconnaissance, credential theft, and data exfiltration. We
observed an average TTR of approximately two days after initial infection. The next section discusses Conti actor
activities that are common across recent attack campaigns that we analyzed. We focus on activities that Conti
actors conduct after establishing a foothold in a system by using the BazarBackdoor or TrickBot malware that
Shathak distributes and before ransomware deployment.

Conti Actors Take Over from Shathak: Common Activities
Cobalt Strike Deployment
Conti actors deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon after initial system compromise by using TrickBot or BazarBackdoor.
Cobalt Strike is a common tool of Conti actors for different malicious activities, such as command execution,
credential theft, and lateral movement. Conti actors deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon in the form of a dynamic-link
library (DLL) file stored in the ProgramData directory, such as C:\ProgramData. Conti actors then invoke an
exported function of the DLL file, such as StartW or gimbild, using the rundll32.exe Windows utility:

Conti actors establish persistence of the deployed Cobalt Strike beacon by creating a scheduled task using the
schtasks Windows utility. The scheduled task executes the Cobalt Strike beacon by invoking an exported function
of the DLL file that implements the beacon using the rundll32.exe utility. Conti actors deploy Cobalt Strike
beacons laterally on other networked machines by executing the schtasks utility, with the command line
parameter /s specifying the target machine:

Reconnaissance
In attack campaigns where a BazarBackdoor infection is the initial entry point into an infrastructure, Conti actors
conduct reconnaissance activities by using BazarBackdoor to execute the following commands:
7/16

Command

Description

nltest
/domain_trusts
/all_trusts

Enumerates trust relationships in a Windows Active Directory (AD) environment.

net localgroup
administrator

Enumerates users that are members of the administrator local group.

net group "domain
admins" /domain

Enumerates users that are members of the domain admins group such that the
designated Domain Controller (DC) is conducting the enumeration activity.

net view /all
/domain

Enumerates all shared computers and resources on the system and all domains in the
network.

net view /all

Enumerates all shared computers and resources on the system.

In addition to the nltest and net Windows utilities, Conti actors use publicly available network scanning tools for
reconnaissance, such as the Advanced IP Scanner and NetScan tools:

Conti actors conduct reconnaissance activities using net and NetScan s seen in the Cybereason Defense
Platform
In addition to the nltest and net utilities, Conti actors use the AdFind tool to explore AD environments in greater
detail. Conti actors typically execute AdFind stored in a Windows Batch file (.bat) that is placed on the file system:

Credential and Data Theft
Conti actors steal credentials by dumping the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass)
process. Conti actors download PowerShell payload from an attacker-controlled endpoint, such as
httpx://datasecuritytoday[.]com::757/securiday, which dumps credentials from lsass:

Defense Platform
In addition to credentials present in the memory of lsass instances, Conti actors steal AD data and credentials
that are stored in ntds.dit files by copying these files. The ntds.dit files are database files that are present on AD
DCs, and these files store AD data, such as password hashes and information about AD user objects, groups,

9/16

and group memberships. Conti actors copy ntds.dit files into the C:\Windows\Temp\crashpad directory by using
the ntdsutil tool:
ntdsutil “ac i ntds” “ifm” “create full c:\windows\temp\crashpad” q q
In addition to ntdsutil, Conti actors use the NtdsAudit tool to dump AD domain user details and password hashes
from previously copied ntds.dit files:
ntdsAudit.exe ntds.dit -s SYSTEM -p pwddump.txt -u users.csv
On machines running Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) database servers, Conti actors dump data
databases by using the sqlcmd utility. The sqlcmd commands that the actors execute follow the guidelines for
dumping data from databases in the publicly disclosed manuals of the Conti Ransomware Affiliate Program:

Lateral Movement
Conti actors move laterally to Windows Server instances primarily by using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
Conti actors enable RDP connectivity if necessary on compromised machines by creating and setting the
following registry value to 0:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\fDenyTSConnections
Conti actors then use the netsh utility to modify Windows Firewall rules:
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”remote desktop” new enable=Yes
netsh firewall set service type = remotedesktop mode = enable
In addition to establishing RDP connections, Conti actors deploy Cobalt Strike beacons laterally on networked
machines by executing the schtasks utility, with the command line parameter /s specifying the target machine.
Conti actors also disable the real-time monitoring feature of the Windows Defender security solution laterally on
networked machines by executing the PowerShell command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealTimeMonitoring
$true.

10/16

Conti actors execute the PowerShell command laterally by using the schtasks utility and the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) command-line utility (WMIC) with the node WMIC parameter specifying the
target machine:

Defense Platform

Data Exfiltration
Conti actors typically exfiltrate data before deploying the Conti ransomware. The exfiltrated data contains stolen
credentials and other data, including potentially sensitive data that the actors can use for extortion. To exfiltrate
data to a remote endpoint, Conti actors use the Rclone tool, whose executable name the actors typically change
to evade detection. In the Conti actor campaigns that we analyzed, the actors have changed the executable
name of Rclone to sihosts.exe and serhosts.exe:

Detection and Prevention
The Cybereason Defense Platform

11/16

The Cybereason Defense Platform detects threats using multi-layer protection that detects and blocks malicious
activities with threat intelligence, machine learning, and next-generation antivirus (NGAV) capabilities. The
Cybereason Platform is able to detect and prevent infections that use the TrickBot and BazarBackdoor malware
that the Shathak threat group distributes, as well as malicious activities that Conti actors conduct. For example,
the Cybereason Platform detects:
