Trojan Tricks Victims Into Transferring Funds

It’s horrifying enough when a computer crook breaks into your PC, steals your passwords
and empties your bank account. Now, a new malware variant uses a devilish scheme to trick
people into voluntarily transferring money from their accounts to a cyber thief’s account.
The German Federal Criminal Police (the
“Bundeskriminalamt” or BKA for short) recently
warned consumers about a new Windows
malware strain that waits until the victim logs in
to his bank account. The malware then presents
the customer with a message stating that a
credit has been made to his account by mistake,
and that the account has been frozen until the
errant payment is transferred back.
When the unwitting user views his account
balance, the malware modifies the amounts displayed in his browser; it appears that he has
recently received a large transfer into his account. The victim is told to immediately make a
transfer to return the funds and unlock his account. The malicious software presents an
already filled-in online transfer form — with the account and routing numbers for a bank
account the attacker controls.
The BKA’s advisory isn’t specific about the responsible strain of malware, but it is becoming
increasingly common for banking Trojans to incorporate “Web injects,” custom designed
plug-ins that manipulate what victims see in their Web browsers.
This attack is an insidious extension of the tactic that was pioneered by the URL Zone
Trojan, which specializes in manipulating the balance that victims see when they log into
their (cleaned-out) bank accounts.
If you log in to your bank account and see something odd, such as a “down for maintenance”
page or an alert about a wayward transfer, your best option is to pick up the phone and call
your bank. Make sure you are using the bank’s real phone number: Malware like the ZeuS
Trojan has been known to present newly-fleeced victims with messages about problems with
the bank’s Web site, along with a bogus customer support phone number.
