“BRATA” is a new Android remote access tool malware family. We used this code name
based on its description – “Brazilian RAT Android”. It exclusively targets victims in Brazil:
however, theoretically it could also be used to attack any other Android user if the
cybercriminals behind it want to. It has been widespread since January 2019, primarily
hosted in the Google Play store, but also found in alternative unofficial Android app stores.
For the malware to function correctly, it requires at least Android Lollipop 5.0 version.
The cybercriminals behind BRATA use few infection vectors. For example, they use push
notifications on compromised websites; and also spread it using messages delivered via
WhatsApp or SMS, and sponsored links in Google searches.
The first samples we found in the wild date to January and February 2019, while so far over
20 different variants have appeared in the Google Play Store, the majority of these pose as
an update to the popular instant messaging application WhatsApp. The CVE-2019-3568
WhatsApp patch is one of the topics abused by BRATA threat actor. Once a victim’s device is
infected, “BRATA” enables its keylogging feature, enhancing it with real-time streaming
functionality. It uses Android’s Accessibility Service feature to interact with other applications
installed on the user’s device.

device. It is also essential to install an excellent up-to-date anti-malware solution with realtime protection enabled.

This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events

cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a

8/10

It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
