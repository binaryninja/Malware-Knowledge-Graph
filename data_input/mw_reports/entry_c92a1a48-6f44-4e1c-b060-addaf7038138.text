EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SAP business applications run a vast number of commercial and government
organizations that sustain global economies. SAP customers include 87% of
Forbes Global 2000 companies, 98% of the 100 most valued brands and 44 of the
world’s military forces. SAP customers produce 78% of the world’s food, 82% of
the world’s medical devices whilst 76% of the world’s transaction revenue is
processed by an SAP system 1

As the leading provider of SAP and Oracle cybersecurity
research and solutions, Onapsis is exclusively focused in
securing these business-critical applications. As an SAP
partner and the ﬁrst to lecture on advanced SAP cyber
threats, Onapsis experts have helped SAP SE by
discovering, reporting and helping to mitigate more than
250 security vulnerabilities in SAP software, enabling SAP
and its customers be more secure from the increasing risk
of cyber-attacks.

IN EARLY 2016, THE ONAPSIS RESEARCH LABS
DISCOVERED INDICATORS OF UNAUTHORIZED
EXPLOITATION OF SAP VULNERABILITIES AT 36
GLOBAL ENTERPRISES.
These enterprises are located in, or are co-owned by
corporations in the United States, United Kingdom,
Germany, China, India, Japan, and South Korea, and
span a number of industries including Oil & Gas,
Telecommunications, Utilities, Retail, Automotive,
Life Sciences, Consumer Products, Chemicals, High
Tech, Engineering, Construction, Operations,
Industrial Machinery and Components, Public Sector,
and Higher Education.
While several threat reports disclose security incidents as
the result of nation-state sponsored cyber campaigns, in
this case, the reality (and what we believe makes this
research even more interesting) is that these indicators
had been silently sitting in the public domain for several
years, until now. We regard these indicators as just the tip
of the iceberg, as well as an irrefutable answer to the
question “are SAP applications being attacked?”

The exploitation of the aﬀected organizations’ SAP systems
was publicly disclosed during 2013-2016 at a digital forum
registered in China. In all cases, the individuals leveraged a
publicly-known SAP application vulnerability, for which SAP had
released a security patch more than ﬁve years ago.
The exploitation of this vulnerability gives remote
unauthenticated attackers full access to the aﬀected SAP
platforms, providing them with complete control of the
business information and processes run by them, as well as
potentially further access to connected SAP and non-SAP
systems.
During April and May 2016, Onapsis alerted its customers and
has worked in collaboration with the US Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), in order to ensure that aﬀected
companies were informed and could mitigate the identiﬁed
cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, the US-CERT has released an
alert which summarizes the risks and solutions described in this
document to further inform security professionals.

The goal of this threat report is to help
Information Security, Internal Audit, and SAP
teams protect their business-critical SAP
applications from real-world cyber-attacks.
This document describes the speciﬁc vulnerability that is
actively being exploited, the types of SAP systems aﬀected,
potentially compromised business processes and information,
and the key recommendations on how to mitigate this
vulnerability to minimize business risk.

ANALYSIS OF THE OBSERVED ATTACK VECTOR
All security incidents described in this threat report exploited the same
fundamental vulnerability. In this section we analyze the nature of this
vulnerability, the aﬀected SAP solutions and the impact resulting from
a successful exploitation.
SAP Java platforms have a wide of set of built-in functionality, providing
a comprehensive framework of libraries and services to support the
development and deployment of SAP applications in Java.
One of these functionalities is the Invoker Servlet, which is part of the
standard J2EE speciﬁcation of Sun (now Oracle). It was conceived as a
rapid development instrument, allowing developers to test their
custom Java applications. When enabled, developers and users can call
servlets directly, without authentication or authorization controls.
The observed exploitations targeted SAP systems that had the Invoker
Servlet enabled, and bypassed authentication controls to access a
sensitive SAP Java application called Conﬁguration Wizard/Template
Installer, which provided functionality to execute arbitrary operating
systems commands and create SAP user accounts.
The exploits can be performed by sending speciﬁc HTTP(S) requests to
the vulnerable SAP system, which further increases the risk of attacks
from remote locations and networks such as the Internet.

In summary, the impact of this attack is the worst possible
outcome: a remote attacker can execute arbitrary operating
systems commands with high-privileges and/or create SAP
administration users, simply using a web browser and without
the need to initially have a valid SAP user id and password in
the target system.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
COMPANIES IMPACTED
Some of the largest global companies were
impacted, including:
One of the top ten highest annually grossing
companies.
13 enterprises which each generate over $10B
in annual revenue.
Members of the Oil & Gas,
Telecommunications, Utilities, Retail,
Automotive, Life Sciences, Consumer Products,
Chemicals, High Tech, Engineering
Construction, Operations, Industrial Machinery
and Components, Public Sector, and Higher
Education.

THE ATTACK VECTOR
Applications exploited were outdated and/or
misconﬁgured SAP NetWeaver Application
Server Java systems (“SAP Java platforms”).
These serve as the foundational technology
stack for several key SAP business solutions,
information and processes.
The vulnerability exploited has been identiﬁed
as the Invoker Servlet vulnerability which was
patched by SAP in 2010, and is being leveraged
in tandem with a sensitive SAP Java application
to remotely gain full administrative access to
the SAP systems.

As described before, SAP released security patches for these attack
vectors several years ago. They have also disabled the Invoker Servlet
functionality by default in newer SAP Java platforms.
The Onapsis Research Labs warned about this threat in 2011, publishing
an SAP security in-depth whitepaper titled “The Invoker Servlet – A
Dangerous Detour into SAP Java Solutions”2.
It is very important to note that while the Invoker Servlet may be
disabled globally, this setting may be overridden by speciﬁc or custom
SAP Java applications. This introduces additional risks and makes it
critical to also review custom applications and to deploy a continuous
monitoring solution to ensure custom applications are not jeopardizing

the security of the entire system.
The SAP Java platform is a technology stack, which may not be easily recognized by business executives as being part of their
SAP implementation. However, depending on the solution version, it is possible that this platform could be providing the base
framework for many SAP business solutions that are currently in use by the organization. These include:
SAP Enterprise Portal (EP)
SAP Process Integration (PI)
SAP Exchange Infrastructure (XI)
SAP Solution Manager (SolMan)
SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
SAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)
SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (BW)

SAP Business Intelligence (BI)
SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure (MI)
SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (NWDI)
SAP Central Process Scheduling (CPS)
SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE)
SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Search
SAP NetWeaver Identity Management (IdM)
SAP Governance, Risk & Control 5.x (GRC)

If any of these solutions are in use at your organization, it is highly recommended that you analyze whether they are
leveraging the SAP Java platform (also referred to as the SAP J2EE Engine), regardless of whether it is in single stack or
dual-stack mode. If these solutions are in use, and are not properly secured, they may be exposed to the attack vector
described in this document.

ANALYZING THE BUSINESS IMPACT
As described in the previous section, a wide range of business solutions run on top of SAP Java platforms.
This means that a signiﬁcant number of critical business processes and information could be breached if
these applications are compromised.
While many executives and security professionals consider
SAP as a “backoﬃce ﬁnancial system”, in reality SAP
applications are the lifeblood of many businesses, managing
critical information such as intellectual property, HR data,
pricing, purchasing agreements, bank accounts, credit cards,
ﬁnancial reports, manufacturing recipes, strategic plans, etc.
Furthermore, they support and run processes related with
areas such as sales & distribution, materials management,
logistics execution, ﬁnancial and managerial accounting,
supply chain, payroll, e-recruiting, and many other functions.
Failing to properly secure SAP installations could have huge
cost implications for an organization, including economic
impact and compliance violations.
Economic impact will vary by organization depending on
speciﬁc circumstances and use of the SAP applications, such
as value chain aﬀected. As a reference point, the CISO of a
Fortune 100 company has estimated losses from an attacker

breaking into and shutting down his organization’s SAP
systems at $22 million per minute.
Additional C-Level contacts at various Fortune 500
enterprises have disclosed that a compromise or termination
of SAP-enabled processes could cease essential business
functions and would potentially be categorized as an
“extinction event” for their organization.
Moreover, as SAP runs several of the largest commercial and
governmental organizations globally, a wide-scale attack
against these applications could have macro-economic impact
on most modern economies.

If SAP systems are taken oﬄine, the expected average ﬁnancial
consequence for companies is $4.5 million. These costs include
direct cash outlays, direct labor expenditures, indirect labor
costs, overhead costs and lost business opportunity.

MITIGATION - PROTECTING YOUR SAP BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
Mitigating the Invoker Servlet (and related) vulnerabilities

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is necessary to disable the Invoker Servlet. This can be done by following the steps below:

1

Check if the property "EnableInvokerServletGlobally" is present in the SAP Java system. In case it is not, implement SAP
Note 1445998. The implementation of this note will create the property that enables the disabling of the Invoker Servlet.
It’s important to note that SAP has disabled Invoker Servlet by default in 7.20 (in the patch levels described in SP Patch
Level section of Note 1445998) and in the initial shipment of 7.30 version of the J2EE Engine. However, administrators
could have changed this setting due to technical or business requirements and rendered the systems insecure.

2

Start the SAP J2EE conﬁguration tool, select the “Global Server Conﬁguration” in the cluster-data tree. Click on the
services node and select “servlet_jsp”. In the global properties list set the “EnableInvokerServletGlobally” to FALSE. Save
the options and restart the instance.

3

Several business applications run on top of SAP Java systems. In the case that one of the following applications is running
on your environment, make sure the mentioned SAP Security Notes are reviewed and implemented, otherwise business
functionality may be disrupted or certain risks may remain active:
SAP Enterprise Portal - SAP Note 1467771
SAP BillerDirect – SAP Notes 1537663 and 1802092
SAP Virus Scan Engine – SAP Note 1900752
SAP CRM – SAP Notes 1598246 and 1488846
SAP Classiﬁed Advertising Management – SAP Note 1535301

4

Start the SAP J2EE conﬁguration tool, select the “Global Server Conﬁguration” in the cluster-data tree. Click on the
services node and select “servlet_jsp”. In the global properties list set the “EnableInvokerServletGlobally” to FALSE. Save
the options and restart the instance.

Furthermore, as described before, speciﬁc or custom SAP Java applications may override the global setting for the Invoker
Servlet, therefore it is important to review and mitigate these risks. These applications should use local speciﬁc servlets
within their web.xml ﬁles. In order to achieve this, locate the <servlet-name>invoker</servlet-name> conﬁguration in the
web.xml ﬁle of the application and set its parameter InvokerServletLocallyEnabled to “false”. Bear in mind that this may
require reengineering the code of the application. More information can be found in the attachment in SAP Note 1445998.

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

These ﬁndings highlight the existence of a dangerous blind spot for CISOs and CIOs: how can the applications which house an
organization’s crown jewels and run the most important business processes be exposed to such a critical security vulnerability, for which
the vendor provided a patch more than ﬁve years ago? In light of these risks, we highly recommend SAP customers to:

Understand their SAP implementation, its primary usage and processes as well as the key informational assets it manages.
Continuously identify existing vulnerabilities and SAP interfaces to understand the attack surface.
Correlate vulnerabilities to corporate risk posture to determine top risks to the business and prioritize remediation eﬀorts
and potential compensating controls.
Maintain SAP cybersecurity standards, guidelines and patching processes to stay aligned with the latest security patches and
improvements provided by SAP.
Implement detective monitoring capabilities to gain visibility into indicators of compromise regarding the use of known SAP
exploits, zero-days and suspicious SAP user activity.
Integrate Information Security, Audit, SAP Security & BASIS teams into an SAP cybersecurity program

CONCLUSIONS
Business-critical applications running on SAP house the “crown jewels” of any large organization,
and they are no longer conﬁned to “internal” or isolated networks. SAP implementations have
transformed through trends like cloud, mobile, big data and IoT, all of which expand the attack
surface of a company and these applications. Eﬀectively securing SAP applications is critical to
accelerate the adoption of these new technology paradigms and to enable companies to realize
the maximum value from their investment in SAP solutions.
As the leading SAP partner in cybersecurity, Onapsis has seen
ﬁrst-hand how SAP is signiﬁcantly increasing its eﬀorts in
providing more secure business software. At the same time, it
is important for customers to recognize that SAP is not a
cybersecurity company and, just like with any other major
software vendor, applying security patches and
recommended security conﬁgurations depends on your own
organization and cybersecurity partners.

best possible economics for cyber attackers: The world's
largest organizations running on the same highly-complex
technology platform, which is usually exposed to known
vulnerabilities and has high-value business assets and
processes by deﬁnition. On top of that, attackers enjoy of
reduced chances of being detected, due to several
organizations still missing the right governance model and
specialized solutions.

These ﬁndings are a clear example of how attackers are
leveraging an organizations’ lack of governance over the
security of business applications, as SAP made a security
patch available several years ago.

Given the cross-functional nature of these applications, it is
imperative to implement a proper SAP cybersecurity
program that is aligned to eﬀectively secure SAP
applications and data. As with any security initiative, it takes
the right combination of people, process and technology to
be successful.

While this is the ﬁrst threat report that undercovers the
active exploitation of SAP systems publicly, we know for a
fact that this is just the tip of the iceberg. These ﬁndings only
refer to the exploitation of a single vulnerability. SAP has
released over 3,000 security patches to date, issuing on
average over ~30 security patches per month .
Based on our experience engaging with large SAP customers,
we often ﬁnd vulnerabilities present in systems despite SAP
having released patches as far back as 10 years ago. This is
very common in a vast majority of the implementations we’ve
seen, and provides both insiders and remote attackers with
wide-open doors into the heart of large enterprises. Our
team has also been engaged in a number of SAP forensics &
incidents response projects, resulting from real-world
breaches to SAP applications.
Still, many organizations lack the proper preventative,
detective and corrective controls to secure a company’s SAP
applications, and have a reigning false sense of security
provided by generic security products, GRC solutions and
traditional Segregation of Duties controls and audits. While
all these eﬀorts, processes and technology are necessary to
protect SAP systems, they are not designed to provide deep
visibility, control and protection against remote cyber
attackers and malicious insiders targeting SAP business
applications.

WE HOPE THAT THIS THREAT
REPORT HELPS BRING VISIBILITY
TO THIS OVERLOOKED AREA, AND
EMPOWERS EXECUTIVES TO
MITIGATE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS ONE
OF THE MOST CRITICAL CYBER
RISKS TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS.

The status-quo is not sustainable. According to IDC “because
over 75% of all transactions occur on business-critical
applications, data from these systems is endlessly valuable to
attackers”. In this scenario, business applications provide the
