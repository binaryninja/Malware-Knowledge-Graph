Thought you were safe and there aren't any more cyber threats to consider?
Nothing further from the truth, actually, as you are about to meet Kraken.
This dangerous botnet can now easily bypass any Windows Defender scans.
It can download and execute payloads, run shell commands, take screenshots.

1/5

As most of you may already know, the Redmond-based tech company recently made an
important update to the Window Defender Exclusions permission list.
Now, due to the change implemented by Microsoft, it is no longer possible to view the
excluded folders and files without administrator rights.
As you can imagine, this is a significant change as cybercriminals often use this information
to deliver malicious payloads inside such excluded directories in order to bypass Defender
scans.
But, even so, safety is a relative term and whenever we think that we are safe, there are
always going to be insidious third parties ready to breach our security.

Beware of the new Kraken botnet
Even with all the safety measures taken by Microsoft, a new botnet called Kraken, which was
recently discovered by ZeroFox, will still infect your PC.
Kraken adds itself as an exclusion instead of trying to look for excluded places to deliver the
payload, which is a relatively simple and effective way to bypass Windows Defender scan.
The team stumbled upon this dangerous botnet back in October 2021, when nobody was
aware of its existence, or the harm it could do.
Though still under active development, Kraken already features the ability to download and
execute secondary payloads, run shell commands, and take screenshots of the victim’s
system.
It currently makes use of SmokeLoade in order to spread, quickly gaining hundreds of bots
each time a new command and control server is deployed.

The security team that made the discovery also noted that Kraken is mainly a stealer
malware, similar to the recently discovered Windows 11 lookalike website.
Kraken’s capabilities now include the ability to steal information related to users’
cryptocurrency wallets, reminiscent of the recent fake KMSPico Windows activator malware.
The botnet’s feature set is simplistic for such software. Although not present in earlier builds,
the bot is capable of collecting information about the infected host and sending it back to the
command and control (C2) server during registration.
The information collected seems to vary from build to build, though ZeroFox has observed
the following being collected:
Hostname
Username

Build ID (TEST_BUILD_ + the timestamp of the first run)
CPU details
GPU details
Operating system and version
If you want to find out more about this malicious botnet and how you can better protect
yourself against attacks, make sure you read the full ZeroFox diagnostic.
Also, be sure to also stay on top of any sort of attacks that might come via Teams. It pays to
always stay one step ahead of hackers.
