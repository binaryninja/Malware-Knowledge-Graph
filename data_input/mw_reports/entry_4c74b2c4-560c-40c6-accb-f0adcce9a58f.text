description
Microsoft 365 Defender repository for
Advanced Hunting

We moved to Microsoft threat protection community, the unified Microsoft Sentinel and
Microsoft 365 Defender repository.
Microsoft SIEM and XDR Community provides a forum for the community members, aka,
Threat Hunters, to join in and submit these contributions via GitHub Pull Requests or
contribution ideas as GitHub Issues. Hunting queries for Microsoft 365 Defender will provide
value to both Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Sentinel products, hence a multiple
impact for a single contribution. These contributions can be just based on your idea of the
value to enterprise your contribution provides or can be from the GitHub open issues list or
even enhancements to existing contributions.
