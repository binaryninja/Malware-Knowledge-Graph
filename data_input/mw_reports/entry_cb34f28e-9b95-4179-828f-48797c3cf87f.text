This report covers Iranian social engineering cases and methodologies. It serves those
looking to better understand, prepare for, and preempt an attack by Iranian operators against
their personnel and organization and benefits Iran-focused analysts researching topics
associated with Iranian social engineering to understand their typical targets, organizations,
and objectives. Sources include the Recorded Future® Platform and industry reporting from
Microsoft, Proofpoint, ClearSky, FireEye, Mandiant, and CitizenLab, among other open
sources.

Executive Summary
Since 2010, pro-Iranian government cyber intrusions have relied on social engineering as a
component of the cyberattack life cycle, whether executed through spearphishing attacks or
more directly through one-to-one engagements. Iranian operators have targeted members of
foreign governments, militaries, businesses, and political dissidents. Their operations appear
to use many of the studied “principles of influence” and overlap with human intelligence
(HUMINT) recruitment practices, both of which influence social engineering methodologies.
Research on the Iranian government’s strategic and tactical approaches to the offensive and
defensive “Soft War” also suggests that social engineering is an indispensable element of the
government’s cyber capabilities, which it has relied on for at least a decade. Tehran views
the ability for a foreign power to incite domestic upheaval as being as dangerous as a
military attack on its territory. Equally so, the ability to foment social unrest internationally is a
capability at its disposal to attack its perceived enemies. Understanding and dissecting
foreign societies, languages, cultures, and political systems has enabled Tehran to leverage
social engineering in ways comparable to Russian threat activity groups.
Large-scale social engineering campaigns have predominantly been executed by APT35,
Tortoiseshell, and APT34, and their associated sub-groups. While their operations do not
diminish those run by other advanced persistent threat groups (APTs), these 3 Iran-nexus
groups have depicted substantial tradecraft overlaps in how they target their victims. These
include the use of charismatic sock puppets, the lure of prospective job opportunities,
solicitation by journalists, and masquerading as think tank experts seeking opinions. These
are just some of the personas which these 3 Iranian APTs have continued to use since the
first major disclosure on Iranian social engineering — Operation Newscaster — was publicly
reported in 2014.

Key Judgments
The use of social engineering is a central component of Iranian APT tradecraft when
engaging in cyber espionage and information operations. Iranian APTs will continue to
modify their tradecraft, including phishing, spoofing, smishing, and other techniques to
target their victims.

3/5

Multiple Iranian threat activity groups use social engineering. APT35, APT34, and
Tortoiseshell remain among the earliest and most aggressive adopters of social
engineering to aid their intrusion or credential theft operations. We expect these groups
to continue to lead attacks using social engineering techniques in the future.
Patterns in Iranian social engineering attacks suggest they aim to drive targets to
multiple platforms; this increases the attack surface by incorporating email, social
media, and chat messengers as attack vectors. Malicious documents and applications
will continue to be disseminated via one-to-one sock puppet engagements with their
targets.
Various reported Iranian social engineering attacks share approaches, including
recruitment offers, offers to solicit targets for journalistic purposes or political analysis,
romantic engagements, and supposed anti-government activism.
The use of foreign languages and knowledge of foreign societies and cultures will
continue to play a central role in targeted social engineering attacks. Iranian APTs are
improving their command of major languages such as English and major European,
Middle Eastern, and South Asian languages.

Background
The growth of Iranian social engineering can be traced to Iranian hacker forums, with many
including sub-threads on the techniques necessary to target unsuspecting victims. Some of
the earliest examples include the “Simorgh Security Team”, among the first to differentiate
social engineering from other hacking disciplines. Members of that group claimed that a
social engineer must be persuasive, articulate, and possess strong analytical and
intelligence gathering skills.
Social engineering, a component of Iran’s defensive and offensive cyber capabilities
embedded in pro-government Iranian cyber doctrine, can be traced to institutionalized
ideologies such as the “Soft War” (‫)ﺟﻨﮓ ﻧﺮم‬. The concept of Soft War was established as far
back as 2010 and aims to counter subversion, or political, religious, economic, and cultural
ideals that may lead to the destabilization and fall of the Islamic Republic. These goals are
likely achieved by networks of trusted experts rooted deeply in Iran’s military and intelligence
organizations.
For example, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Kerman
province (Sarullah Corps) recognized the role of repatriating Iranian “elites” in countering
enemy influence and disinformation campaigns, declaring them key in the struggle against
“the disproportionate soft war and psychological operations [PSYOPS] of the enemy”. In this
context, elites refer to highly educated Iranians close to the regime who have been directed
to seek education and employment opportunities abroad.
The IRGC and its auxiliary force the Basij, as well as the Ministry of Intelligence and Security
(MOIS), have cemented their role in the field to counter the Soft War since 2010; they have
established multiple operational bases that, at least in name, are dedicated to the Soft War,
4/5

such as the Baqiatallah al-Azam Social and Cultural Base (‫)ﻗﺮارﮔﺎه ﺑﻘﯿﺔاﷲ اﻻﻋﻈﻢ‬. The Baqiatallah
base is currently headed by the former commander of the IRGC, General Mohammad Ali
Jafari, who on this matter claimed in November 2021 that the Islamic Republic’s enemies
aimed to destroy it and that “soft, cultural, and media wars” were harder to combat than a
kinetic war.
Open source analysis has referred to Tehran’s strategic threat perceptions within this space.
As early as 2010, Iran viewed social media platforms as “elements of a cyber warfare threat
… particularly in the way rumors are spread online to ‘stir up’ discord within Iran”, following
its own threats to the establishment that arose from the 2009 Green Movement. Iran has
proven to strategically leverage the same threat calculus, along with the other Big Four
(Russia, China, and to a lesser extent North Korea) adversarial nations, against its
adversaries, including the US government.
Operationally, Iranian social engineering depicts a strong emphasis on the use of foreign
languages and cultures to execute defensive and offensive campaigns against domestic
foes, such as anti-revolutionary fronts like the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MEK) and
the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), and nations which Iran perceives to be its
adversaries: the US, the UK, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Pro-government operators understand
adversarial societies and cultures well enough to mimic them; this capability manifests,
whether successful or not, in information operations, psyops, and cyber intrusions.
