Remote Access Trojan Capable of Conducting Ransomware & DDOS Activities

1/12

A Remote Access Trojan or RAT is a tool used by Threat Actors (TAs) to gain full access and remote control on a
user’s system, including mouse and keyboard control, files access, and network resources access.
During our regular OSINT research, Cyble Research Labs came across a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
named Borat. Unlike other RATs, the Borat provides Ransomware, DDOS services, etc., to Threat Actors along
with usual RAT features, further expanding the malware capabilities.
The developer named this RAT ‘Borat’ after a black comedy mockumentary film, and the photo used in the RAT is
of actor Sacha Baron Cohen, who played the main role in the film Borat. The features claimed by the Borat RAT
author are given in Figures 1 & 2 below.

Figure 2: Additional Features provided by Borat RAT
The Borat RAT provides a dashboard to Threat Actors (TAs) to perform RAT activities and also has an option to
compile the malware binary for performing DDoS and ransomware attacks on the victim’s machine, as shown in
Figure 3.

Technical Analysis

3/12

In this analysis, we will take a look at Borat RAT and its features in detail. The Borat RAT comes as a package
which includes builder binary, supporting modules, server certificate, etc., as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Borat Package

The figure below shows the supporting modules responsible for executing the RAT features, as shown in Figure
5.

execute Features

Keylogger
The module “keylogger.exe” is responsible for monitoring and storing the keystrokes in the victim’s machine. The
below image shows the keyboard-related APIs used by the RAT for keylogging purposes. The captured
keystrokes are saved in a file called “Sa8XOfH1BudXLog.txt” for exfiltration.

Ransomware
Interestingly, the RAT has an option to deliver a ransomware payload to the victim’s machine for encrypting users’
files as well as for demanding a ransom. Like other ransomware, this RAT also has the capability to create a
ransom note on the victim’s machine.

Figure 7: Code to generate

Ransom Note
The RAT has the code to decrypt files in the victim’s machine once the ransom is paid – as shown below.

Method

DDOS
This RAT can also disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server by performing a DDOS attack. The below figure
shows the code used by RAT for the DDOS attack.

Audio Recording
Borat RAT can record the audio of a computer. Initially, it checks if a microphone is present in the victim’s
machine. If it can find a connected microphone, the RAT records all audio and saves it in a file named
micaudio.wav.

Figure 10: Code for Mic Recording

Webcam Recording
Borat RAT can capture videos through any webcam present in the victim’s machine. First, it identifies if a webcam
is present in the victim’s machine, and then it starts recording the video if a webcam is available.

Figure 11: Webcam Recording

Remote Desktop
This malware takes the remote desktop of the infected machine. It then gives the Threat Actor (TA) the necessary
rights to perform activities such as controlling the victim’s machine, mouse, keyboard, and capturing the screen.
Controlling the victim’s machine can allow TAs to perform several activities such as deleting critical files,

executing ransomware in the compromised machine, etc. The below figure shows the functions used by the RAT
for performing Remote Desktop activities.

Figure 12: Functions used for performing Remote Desktop Activities

Reverse Proxy
The RAT has code to enable reverse proxy for performing RAT activities anonymously. The TAs can hide their
identity using this option while communicating with the compromised servers.

Figure 13: Reverse Proxy Code

Device Information
The RAT collects information from the victim’s machine, including OS Name, OS Version, System Model, etc. The
below figure shows the command used for collecting the information.

Command used for Capturing Device Info

Process hollowing
Using the RAT, the TAs can inject malicious code into the legitimate processes using the process hollowing
technique. The below figure shows the APIs used by the RAT for process hollowing.

Browser Credential Stealing
Borat RAT can steal cookies, history, bookmarks, saved login credentials from chromium-based browsers like
Google Chrome, Edge, etc.The below figure shows the functions used by the RAT for stealing browser
credentials.

Figure 16: Functions used for Stealing Browser Credentials

Discord token Stealing:
The RAT also steals Discord tokens and sends the stolen token information to the attacker.

Remote Activities:
The RAT performs the following activities to disturb the victims: Play Audio, Swap Mouse Buttons, Show/hide the
Desktop, Show/hide the taskbar, Hold Mouse, Enable/Disable webcam light, Hang System, Monitor Off, Blank
screen, etc.

Conclusion
The Borat RAT is a potent and unique combination of Remote Access Trojan, Spyware, and Ransomware,
making it a triple threat to any machine compromised by it. With the capability to record audio and control the
webcam and conduct traditional info stealing behavior, Borat is clearly a threat to keep an eye on. The added
functionality to carry out DDOS attacks makes this an even more dangerous threat that organizations and
individuals need to look out for. The Cyble Research Team is closely monitoring the RAT’s actions and will keep
informing our clients and people worldwide.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers.
We recommend that our readers follow the suggestions given below:
Don’t keep important files in common locations such as the Desktop, My Documents, etc.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices
wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including PC,
laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.
