Update 05.28.2020: Added a missing C&C contributed by Christiaan Beek
Update 06.11.2020: Diligent security folks at Aviat Networks have remediated any potential
issues with their site and it should no longer be considered a C&C for Kazuar SysInTurla.
Note 06.11.2020: The researchers at Leonardo described gave a great talk on Penquin
Turla x64 at OPCDE.
Today’s threat actor of choice is one of my favorites, Turla (namesake of this blog). This
prolific threat actor relies on a variety of toolkits (including Skipper, IcedCoffee, KopiLuwak
among others). In the past two weeks alone, two distinct clusters of their activities piqued
the interest of multiple research groups (see: Leonardo’s ‘Penquin_x64’ and ESET’s
COMrat v4 reports), but their bag of tricks is hardly exhausted. This short ‘tipper’ will
discuss Kazuar and a universal love for Mark Russinovich’s SysInternal Tools.

A Dangerous Bird with Odd Plumage

Cassowary – ‘The World’s Most Dangerous Bird’
In 2017, Brandon Levene, Robert Falcone, and Tyler Halfpop of Palo Alto networks
discovered a new toolkit they called ‘Kazuar’. The name is a transliteration of the Russian
term for the Cassowary, a flightless yet somehow dangerous bird. The malware is a .NETbased trojan obfuscated with ConfuserEx. Oddly enough, the malware includes artifacts
suggesting multi-platform variants for MacOS and *nix, though neither were found in-thewild as far as I know. The Palo Alto report is excellent and can be relied upon for a
breakdown of the malware’s behavior. Sporadic samples of Kazuar were reported in 20172018.

As of 2019, it appears that Turla operators decided to apply different ‘window dressing’ to
their Kazuar deployments. –one with security appeal at that. Mark Russinovich’s SysInternal
Suite of tools is a favorite among system administrators, malware analysts, and security
researchers alike. It turns out, the infamous Turla shares our love for Mark’s handy tools.

Newer Kazuar samples are (poorly) branded to look like a SysInternal tool called
‘DebugView’. While the original enables users to monitor debug output from local and
remote systems, Turla’s new Kazuar samples enable a far more nefarious remote
monitoring. Apart from cosmetic changes, the new Kazuar samples no longer rely on
ConfuserEx. The new .NET obfuscator is a pain in the ass and defied my google dorking
method of identification. However, it appears to continue to rely on the DLL injection
mechanism into explorer.exe described in the Palo Alto blog.

PE Version Info for Legitimate SysInternals DebugView (Left) and Kazuar 2019 (Right)
As you can see, the brand abuse is quite crude and inconsistent and lends itself to easy
sigging. As of writing, I’ve stumbled upon four samples. Hashes, partial IOCs, and YARA
rules available in the technical appendix below.
A Special Note: As I was wrapping up this writeup, I found partial overlaps with an
excellent private report released this month by PwC’s threat intel researchers. For a
detailed breakdown of the new Kazuar variants, refer to PwC’s ‘Blue Python – Kazuars
cryptic strings’ report (May 2020). That includes a better handling of their new obfuscator.
