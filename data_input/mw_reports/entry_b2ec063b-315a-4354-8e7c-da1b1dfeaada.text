XOR DDoS is a Linux Trojan malware with rootkit capabilities that was used to launch largescale DDoS attacks. Its name stems from the heavy usage of XOR encryption in both
malware and network communication to the C&Cs. It is built for multiple Linux architectures
like ARM, x86 and x64. Noteworthy about XOR DDoS is the ability to hide itself with an
embedded rootkit component which is obtained by multiple installation steps. [1] It was
discovered in September 2014 by MalwareMustDie, a white hat malware research group. [2]
[3][4] From November 2014 it was involved in massive brute force campaign that lasted at
least for three months. [5]
In order to gain access it launches a brute force attack in order to discover the password to
Secure Shell services on Linux.[6] Once Secure Shell credentials are acquired and login is
successful, it uses root privileges to run a script that downloads and installs XOR DDoS.[7] It
is believed to be of Asian origin based on its targets, which tend to be located in Asia. [8]
