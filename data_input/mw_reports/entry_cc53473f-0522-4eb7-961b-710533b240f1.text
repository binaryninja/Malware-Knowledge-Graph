Phishing campaigns by the Nobelium intrusion set

Summary
ANSSI (French National Cybersecurity Agency) has observed a number of phishing campaigns directed against
French entities since February 2021. Of particular note, the intrusion set involved during this malicious activity
has succeeded in compromising email accounts belonging to French organisations, and then using these to send
weaponised emails to foreign institutions. Moreover, French public organisations have also been recipients of
spoofed emails sent from supposedly compromised foreign institutions.
Technical indicators observed by ANSSI correspond to activities associated with the Nobelium intrusion set. This
intrusion set would have been used in other attack campaigns targeting diplomatic entities and international organisations across Europe and North America. Overlaps have also been identiﬁed in the tactics, techniques & procedures (TTP) between the phishing campaigns monitored by ANSSI and the supply chain attack via SOLARWINDS
in 2020.
This report lays out the technical information related to the phishing campaigns, beginning with details as to the
nature of the malicious activities observed (section 1), the tactics, techniques & procedures (section 2) and the attack
infrastructure (section 3). Similarities found with publicly documented intrusion sets are detailed in section 4.
Recommendations (section 5) and indicators of compromise (appendix A) are available at the end of the document
in order to help defenders protect against this type of attack and assess possible compromises.

Phishing campaigns by the Nobelium intrusion set

1. Background
Since February 2021, ANSSI has dealt with a series of phishing campaigns directed against French entities. The
campaigns escalated signiﬁcantly in May 2021. This malicious activity is attributable to one and the same intrusion
set.
The intrusion set succeeded in compromising email accounts belonging to French organisations, before using these
access points to send weaponised emails to foreign institutions in the diplomatic sector. The initial method of
intrusion remains unknown.
French public organisations have also been recipients of spoofed emails. These messages were sent from foreign
institutions seemingly compromised by the same intrusion set.
N.B.: a threat actor is a deﬁned set, made up of identiﬁed or identiﬁable individuals claiming to belong to an organisation.
A threat actor implements one or more toolsets. An intrusion set is deﬁned as the package of tools, tactics, techniques,
procedures and characteristics implemented by one or more threat actors within the context of one or more cyber attacks.

Category

Reconnaissance

Initial Access

Technique ID

Technique name

Comment

T1584.001

Compromise Infrastructure: Domains

The intrusion set uses compromised domains to host ﬁngerprinting information retrieved by VaporRage [1].

T1586.002

Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts

The intrusion set compromises email accounts in order to send its phishing emails.

T1583.001

Acquire Infrastructure: Domains

The intrusion set mainly uses the registrars NAMECHEAP and NAMESILO to create its C2 infrastructure.

T1583.003

Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server

The C2 infrastructure is created using virtual private servers from different providers.

T1590.005

Gather Victim Network Information: IP Addresses

EnvyScout malware collects victim information, which it then exﬁltrates to an attacker-controlled
server [1].

1589.001

Gather Victim Identity Information: Credentials

EnvyScout code attempts to log into an attacker-controlled server using SMB, potentially exﬁltrating
NTLM authentication credentials [1].

T1199

Trusted Relationship

Phishing emails are sent using compromised email addresses from trusted entities. The intrusion set
masquerades as the trusted entity by using the compromised email address.

T1566.001

Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment

The intrusion set’s phishing email contains a malicious HTML ﬁle attachment called EnvyScout [1].

T1566.002

Phishing: Spearphishing Link

The intrusion set hosted malware on the GOOGLE DRIVE platform. One of the phishing emails sent
by the intrusion set contained a link to download this malware.

T1566.003

Phishing: Spearphishing via Service

The intrusion set used the online mass-mailing service CONSTANT CONTACT to distribute phishing
emails to hundreds of recipients.

T1204.001

User Execution: Malicious Link

One of the intrusion set’s phishing emails contained a GOOGLE DRIVE link, which downloaded the
malware when the user clicked it [2].

T1204.002

User Execution: Malicious File

To execute the Cobalt Strike payload, the victim needs to open the HTML ﬁle attachment in the
phishing email.

T1059.003

Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell

The intrusion set performed reconnaissance actions via Windows commands.

T1036.005

Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location

The intrusion set renamed the ADFind executable ﬁle to mimic a legitimate executable ﬁle. This
technique has previously been observed by MICROSOFT in the context of the SOLARWINDS supply
chain attack [3].

T1070.004

Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion

With its outcome achieved, the attacker then deleted the reconnaissance tools used (BloodHound and
ADFind) and the output ﬁles generated.

T1087.002

Account Discovery: Domain Account

The intrusion set gathers domain information via Windows commands, BoomBox [1], ADFind and
BloodHound.

Domain Trust Discovery

The intrusion set uses tools such as ADFind or nltest to retrieve information about Domain Trusts.

Exﬁltration Over Web Service: Exﬁltration to Cloud Storage

BoomBox malware exﬁltrates the information gathered via DROPBOX [1].

Exﬁltration Over C2 Channel

Use of the Cobalt Strike HTTP C2 channel.

3. Command and control infrastructure
The payload delivered by the intrusion set is a Cobalt Strike implant. It is conﬁgured to contact its command and
control (C2) servers using HTTPs over port 443.
The domain names and IP addresses corresponding to the C2 infrastructure are available in appendix A.

3.1. Intrusion set servers
The intrusion set’s C2 infrastructure is made up of virtual private servers (VPS) from different hosters. The intrusion
set seems to favour servers located close to the target countries. In particular, several IP addresses within the C2
infrastructure belong to OVH.
A breakdown is shown as follows:

3.2. Domain names
The domain names used by the intrusion set as Cobalt Strike C2 resemble legitimate domain names. A number of
domain names registered by the intrusion set mimic information and news websites. In the majority of cases, the
intrusion set registers its domain names with NAMESILO and NAMECHEAP.

3.3. Cobalt Strike proﬁles
The Cobalt Strike samples used by the attacker are conﬁgured to contact speciﬁc URLs on control servers. The URIs
used include: « /jquery-3.3.1.min.js » and « /jquery-3.3.2.min.js ».
Both URIs correspond to publicly available Cobalt Strike Malleable proﬁles 1 , albeit with certain modiﬁcations
made.

4. Links with publicly documented intrusion sets
The technical indicators observed by ANSSI in sections 2 & 3 correspond to activity associated with the Nobelium
intrusion set as detailed in cybersecurity research by MICROSOFT [4, 1, 5], VOLEXITY [6], SENTINEL LABS [7], ISTROSEC
[8] and ESET [9].
According to MICROSOFT, Nobelium was still active in October 2021. The intrusion set would likely have been used
during other attack campaigns including, since April 2021, those targeting Active Directory Federation Services
servers in an attempt to compromise government bodies, think tanks and private ﬁrms in the USA and in Europe
[10, 11].
In addition, the phishing campaigns detailed in this document apply TTPs [T1036.005, T1087.002 & T1482] similar
to those used during the supply chain attack via SOLARWINDS exposed in December 2020 [3].

5. Recommendations
5.1. Restrict the execution of ﬁle attachments
Given the chain of compromise detailed above, which relies on the opening of a malicious ﬁle attachment as part
of a phishing campaign, it is recommended that suspicious ﬁles are not executed.

5.2. Tightening Active Directory security
The intrusion set tends to focus on Active Directory (AD) servers in particular. Tighter security measures should
be applied. ANSSI has produced a guide containing recommendations for security hardening, which can be found
on the CERT-FR website [12].
