The British government has admitted publicly for the first time that it is all but certain North
Korea carried out the "WannaCry" malware attack which devastated NHS IT systems in May.
A report released by the National Audit Office (NAO) on Friday found that hospital trusts
were left vulnerable to the attack because basic recommendations on cyber-security were
not followed.
Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, the security minister Ben Wallace said the
government now believes a North Korean hacking group was responsible, but stopped short
of suggesting the UK could carry out retaliatory attacks.

"This attack, we believe quite strongly that this came from a foreign state," Mr Wallace said.
Adding that the state involved was "North Korea", he said: "We can be as sure as possible. I
obviously can’t go into the detail of intelligence, but it is widely believed in the community and
across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role."

Asked what the UK could do in response to the attack, the minister admitted that it would be
"challenging" to arrest anyone when a "hostile state" was involved.
He called on the West to instead develop a "doctrine of deterrent" similar to that used to
prevent the use of nuclear weapons. "We do have a counter attack capability," he said. "But
let's remember we are an open liberal democracy with a large reliance on IT systems. We
will obviously have a different risk appetite. If you get into tit for tat there has to be serious
consideration of the risk we would expose UK citizens to."
Earlier an independent investigation concluded that the cyber attack which crippled parts of
the NHS could have been prevented if "basic IT security" measures had been taken.
The head of the NAO warned the health service and Department of Health to "get their act
together" in the wake of the WannaCry crisis, or risk suffering a more sophisticated and
damaging future attack.
The NAO's probe found that almost 19,500 medical appointments, including 139 potential
cancer referrals, were estimated to have been cancelled, with five hospitals having to divert
ambulances away after being locked out of computers on 12 May.

The malware is believed to have infected machines at 81 health trusts across England – a
third of the 236 total, plus computers at almost 600 GP surgeries, the NAO found.
All were running computer systems – the majority Windows 7 – that had not been updated to
secure them against such attacks.
Mr Wallace accepted that the attack could have been avoided if software had been properly
updated.
"It's a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large
organisations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks," he said.
British systems came under attack on a weekly basis from organised criminals and "a
number" of foreign countries which seek to collect intelligence or carry out a "statesponsored criminal attack".
Expanding on the prospect of the UK fighting back back online, he said: "Other countries do
have doctrines and military thinking along that line, but the West – the United States, Europe
and the United Kingdom – are much more thoughtful about these things because, ultimately,
if we were to take some action, we have to remember that some of these states may, as we
have seen with this WannaCry, strike out at the rest of our functions."
In a report cataloguing the failures which led to May's attack, the NAO said that while the
health service's IT arm NHS Digital had issued "critical alerts" about WannaCry in March and
April, the DoH had "no formal mechanism" to determine whether local NHS organisations
had taken any action.
NAO head Sir Amyas Morse said: "There are more sophisticated cyber threats out there than
WannaCry so the Department (of Health) and the NHS need to get their act together to
ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."
More than 300,000 computers in 150 countries were infected with the WannaCry
ransomware.
It crippled organisations from government agencies and global companies by targeting
computers with outdated security.
