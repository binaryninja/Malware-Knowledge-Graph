A recent blog post by Jacob Pimental and Max Kersten highlighted Magecart activity
targeting ticket re-selling websites for the 2020 Olympics and EUFA Euro 2020,
olympictickets2020.com and eurotickets2020.com respectively. These sites were
compromised by a skimmer using the domain opendoorcdn.com for data exfiltration. With
RiskIQ data, our researchers built on the previous reporting to identify more skimming
domains used by the attackers, as well as additional compromised sites. RiskIQ can also
now attribute all these cyberattacks to Magecart Group 12.
The obfuscation and skimming code we observed on opendoorcdn.com matches that used
by Magecart Group 12, whose skimmer and obfuscation techniques we analyzed in our blog
posts, "New Year, Same Magecart: The Continuation of Web-based Supply Chain Attacks"
and "Magento Attack: All Payment Platforms are Targets for Magecart Attacks." However,
there are differences in the techniques employed by Group 12 in these more recent
compromises, which we'll break down here.

In those blog posts, we noted that Group 12 employed base64 encoded checks against the
URL looking for the word "checkout" to identify the proper page on which to load their
skimmer code. This encoding masked both the check itself and the skimmer URL. Quoting
from our May 1st, 2019 report:
"Most of Group 12's injections occur with a pre-filter on the page—a small snippet of
JavaScript that checks to see if they want to inject their skimmer on the page. Here's what it
looks like:"

However, in these more recent cyberattacks, the skimming JavaScript is loaded without
obfuscation or URL checks. Instead, the script loads via a variable the attackers named
'eventsListenerPool,' which is an alias for document.createElement('script'):

On February 3rd, Pimental and Kersten published their followup blog detailing their efforts to
identify further opendoorcdn.com victims and have the skimming domain taken down by the
Chinese company through which it was registered. On February 2nd, RiskIQ observed that
opendoorcdn.com was replaced on at least two of the victim sites named in the blog by a live
skimmer domain, toplevelstatic.com:

RiskIQ has observed the toplevelstatic.com domain on three victim sites so far, all of which
were previously compromised by opendoorcdn.com, as seen through our host pairs data set
in RiskIQ Community:

The domain toplevelstatic.com was registered on February 1st, 2020, through Chinese
registrar Guangzhou Shidaihulian (now.cn) and uses the same DNS provider as
opendoorcdn.com, DNSPod (also based in China). Both domains are hosted on NGINX
servers and use Let's Encrypt certs. The IPs connected to toplevelstatic.com have changed
at least once a day and sometimes more often, with each server, so far, based in Russia.

Hosting for opendoorcdn.com followed a more leisurely pace of flux. From January 2019
through January 2020, it sometimes used the same IP for weeks at a time and utilized
servers based all over the world.

Targets Beyond Sporting Event Ticket Re-selling
RiskIQ's detection logic allowed us to identify additional domains hosting this particular
magecart skimmer. Two popular emergency preparedness sites, beprepared.com and
augasonfarms.com, were affected by one of these additional skimmer domains.

Both sites are owned by Blue Chip Group Manufacturing and appear to be similarly
constructed. We observed augasonfarms.com loading skimming code from
storefrontcdn.com on January 27th. The beprepared.com site seems to have been loading
the skimming code from January 16th through 29th. In these instances, the skimmer was
added through a simple script tag.

It appears the injections have been removed from sites, and they are currently free of
skimming code. Additional IOCs can be viewed in our Magecart Group 12 project here:

Safety in the Age of Magecart
The activity seen here demonstrates that magecart is a persistent and resilient threat. Given
the lucrative nature of card skimming, Magecart attacks will continue to evolve and surprise
security researchers with new capabilities. They're learning from past cyberattacks to stay

one step ahead, so it's on us to do the same. Make sure you're staying up to date by reading

*Update:
Following the publication of this article, we noticed further detections showing that
beprepared.com was also loading skimming code from wappallyzer.com, another Group 12
domain. Our data shows that this began on January 24th. We have communicated this to the
affected company and are working with them to remediate.
