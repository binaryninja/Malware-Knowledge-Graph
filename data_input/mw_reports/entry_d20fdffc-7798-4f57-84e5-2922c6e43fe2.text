Nightmare week for security vendors: Now a Trend Micro
bug is being exploited in the wild

US-Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro disclosed on Wednesday that a threat actor
began using a bug in its antivirus products to gain admin rights on Windows systems as part
of its attacks.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-24557, affects the company’s Apex
One and OfficeScan XG, two advanced security products aimed at enterprise customers.
The bug was discovered last year by Christopher Vella, a vulnerability researcher at
Microsoft, who privately reported the issue to Trend Micro through the company’s Zero-Day
Initiative bug acquisition program.
Trend Micro patched the issue in August 2020, but in an update to its initial security
advisory posted on Wednesday, the security firm said it learned of incidents where this same
bug was weaponized to attack some of its customers.
“The specific flaw exists within the logic that controls access to the Misc folder,” the ZDI team
said last year. “An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
code in the context of SYSTEM.”
Based on this description of the issue, the bug could not be used to break into systems but
was used as a second step in a multi-phase exploit chain after hackers already planted
malicious code on a victim’s computer and used the bug to take full control of an infected
system.

While Trend Micro did not share any details about the attackers, a source familiar with the
attacks told The Record the bug was used by an advanced persistent threat (APT), a term
usually used to refer to state-sponsored cyber-espionage groups.
This bug now becomes the fourth vulnerability in Apex One and OfficeScan XG security
products that has been exploited in the wild after CVE-2019-18187, CVE-2020-8467, and
CVE-2020-8468.
The first three were abused in 2019 and 2020, with the first being used by a Chinese cyberespionage group during an attack on Mitsubishi Electric.

A bad week for security product vendors
News about hackers exploiting the Trend Micro vulnerability comes a day after FireEye
disclosed that multiple hacking groups had also exploited zero-day in security products
from Pulse Secure and SonicWall.
While all these attacks are unrelated, they show a pattern in real-world attacks where threat
actors are slowly realizing that security products are as vulnerable as any other software,
and, because of the central and privileged position they occupy inside most corporate
networks, they are ideal entry points into high-profile targets.
