Bahamut Revisited, More Cyber Espionage in the Middle
East and South Asia

October 27, 2017

Introduction
In June we published on a previously unknown group we named “Bahamut,” a strange
campaign of phishing and malware apparently focused on the Middle East and South Asia.
In the Bahamut report, we documented a capable actor interested in a diverse set of political,
economic, and non-governmental targets, which suggested espionage rather than criminal
intent. Bahamut was shown to be resourceful, not only maintaining their own Android
malware but running propaganda sites, although the quality of these activities varied
noticeably.
Our publication on the campaign coincided with a series of defacements and leaked emails
related to Qatar and its neighbors, the same types of targets that arose in our research.
While we have found no evidence to link the group to these incidents, Bahamut provided a
useful window into the activities rampant in the Gulf at a time when hacking has contributed
to a regional diplomatic crisis. The incident further demonstrated the blurred lines in
cybersecurity between attacks against human rights communities and espionage against
diplomats, as well as the potential role of non-state actors in state-aligned cyber operations.
After publication, the identified operations and malware domains were taken down. For three
months there was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of
September a series of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise
unrelated individuals, employing the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and its
operations are more extensive than first disclosed. Our primary contribution in this update is
to implicate Bahamut in what are likely counterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations,
and to further affirm our belief that the group is a hacker-for-hire operation. Toward this we
document a previously unnoticed link with a campaign targeting South Asia that was
published last year. This post extends the previous publication with recent activity and lends
more evidence to our past hypotheses about the political nature of its operations.

Overlap with Previous Campaigns
Our initial observation of the Bahamut group originated from in-the-wild attempts to deceive
targets into providing account passwords through impersonation of platform providers. After
unpacking the larger targeting of the attacks, the credential theft operations were found to
cover a broad range of interests in the Middle East, such as Turkish diplomats and Iranian
political figures in the lead up to the recent presidential election. As we noted then, these

1/15

incidents stood out because they exceeded the level of care and preparation seen in the
everyday cybercrime. In our report, we also noted a similarity to the “Operation Kingphish”
campaign published by Amnesty International earlier this year. As we wrote then, compared
to Kingphish, Bahamut “operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of
professionalism and ambition.”
A more recent credential theft attempt provided the most credible link between the two
campaigns thus far, and bolsters our hypothesis that the operations are related. Among a
flurry of spearphishing attempts associated with Bahamut in recent weeks, one fake Google
message directed its target to a unique domain (string2port[.]com) to steal login credentials.
The string2port domain (registered in May 2016) strongly reflects the ping2port[.]info domain
(registered in September 2016) that was used in Kingphish against Qatar-focused labor
rights advocates. The ping2port domain is now pending deletion – abandoned due to
discovery – but the previously unnoticed and related string2port has been reused. Given the
similarities in tactics, administration of infrastructure, domains, and other factors, it appears
increasingly clear both campaigns against Middle Eastern diplomats and those directed
against human rights advocates are connected.
The similarities to other research is not limited to Kingphish, and includes a prolific campaign
in South Asia. In our original post we noted that an expansive operation was evident from a
search of potential domains based on common pattern in domain registration and hosting
behavior (an Anglo-European name sometimes followed by a number at mail.ru, often also
found in the DNS ‘Start of Authority’ record). Here too, we find multiple other candidate
domains based on simple search patterns, although other email providers such as Pobox.sk
are now more common. While we published a number of domain names that were clearly
malicious and similar to Bahamut, we did not post the full list out of a concern of false
positives. Included in these results was a domain i3mode[.]com, which used a Mail.ru contact
email and was hosted on a network found in other Bahamut spearphishing attempts.
Whois (i3mode[.]com):
Registrant Name: KEDRICK BROWN
Registrant Phone: +503.503226605642
Registrant Email: KEDRICK.BROWN.84@MAIL.RU
This domain appears in Kaspersky’s blog post “InPage zero-day exploit used to attack
financial institutions in Asia” from November 2016. That campaign targeted financial
institutions with malware that took advantage of a vulnerability in text processing software
popular with Urdu and Arabic speaking users. The domains in the InPage campaign match
the same pattern of registration and hosting within Bahamut. The Urdu connection recalls our
identification of Android malware posing as a Urdu Quranic reference. This thematic overlap
also includes a relevant sample “Analysis Report on Kashmir.exe,” which would be of interest
to a South Asian audience. Additionally, another sample connecting to the i3mode domain

2/15

(“E-Challan.zip”) appears to be a reference to receipt for payment or delivery specific to India
and Pakistan. The staging domain for that malware also has another subdomain that
appeared to reference an Indian business newspaper (“mint-news-portal.hymnfork.com”).
This faint connection in domains and similar interests provides a first hint that Bahamut is
more active than we were previously aware and bolsters our hypothesis that the group is a
hackers-for-hire operation.

Malware Campaigns in South Asia
In the Bahamut report, we discussed two domains found within our search that were linked
with a custom Android malware agent. This connection between the malware and credential
theft was reinforced by some similarities in how the agent reported back to the attacker’s
servers, and thus we felt moderately confident about a link between the credential theft and
the malware. After the publication of the original report, these sites were taken offline despite
the fact that one agent was even updated a six days prior to our post (the “Khuai”
application). Additionally, antivirus engines began to detect copies of this malware based on
common patterns in development, including apps that we were not aware of. Based on a
search of public sources, we find three more malicious applications focused mostly on South
Asia, including samples uploaded from India.

3/15

Included in the newly detected apps was one named “Devoted to Humanity,” which has been
taken down from the Play Store (devoted.to.humanity). Based on the name and domains
used in the communications (“devotedtohumanity-fif[.]info”, which was registered in March
2016), it appears that the application impersonates the “Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation” (FIF)
that ostensibly operates as a religious charity primarily in Pakistan. FIF is notable for its links
to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist organization, which has committed mass-casualty
4/15

attacks in India in support of establishing Pakistani control over the disputed Jammu and
Kashmir border region. As a result of its connections to LeT and international pressure to
crack down on Kashmiri jihadists, Pakistan placed FIF under on a terrorism watch list in
January 2017. The development of a malware agent relevant to Indian and Pakistani security
interests, timed with increased international scrutiny on FIF, suggests a counterterrorism and
intelligence motive for Bahamut’s espionage.
The “Devoted to Humanity” app also references an image hosted on domain
voguextra[.]com, which appears to have been used to stage decoy documents.

The Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation app is not the only Kashmir-related campaign associated
with Bahamut. Pivoting off the unique contact information used to register the FIF domain,
“adgnad dangda” and “adgnad@mail.ru”, we also find two more (“Android-Cloud.net” and
“Kashmir-Weather-Info.com”) that were cohosted on the same server as the FIF site. The
Kashmir Weather domain corresponds with a now-removed Android application with the
similar set of permissions and tactics found in the previous malware (com.weather.kashmir).
The purpose of the “Android-Cloud.net” domain is not currently known.

5/15

It is important to note that the domains had lapsed and were re-registered since they were
first used. So while they appear to be malicious, the current custody is unclear. The domains
now purport to be for a platform “Donkey Service” (“DoDoDonkey”), which provides a less
than credible pitch:
Donkey Service has incredibly large network and infrastructure to stop really large
attacks on the Mobile system.
We just get clean requests and never have to deal with malicious traffic or attacks on
the Mobile infrastructure. We are the perfect partner for our business!

As with the “Khuai” Chinese-English translator malware in the previous post, other identified
agents have unclear targets, such as the “MXI Player” that was last updated August 2017
(mxiplayer[.]com). MXI Player appears to be a version of the Bahamut agent, designed to
record the phone calls and collect other information about the user (com.mxi.videoplay).
After having been kicked off Play Store several times, it appears that Bahamut is now
hosting its agent on the APKPure alternative app store. However, the malware retains certain
design choices seen in previous attacks, for example around encryption and communications
with the attacker server. As a result, it is already flagged as Bahamut by antivirus engines.
More interestingly, the MXI Player site also includes a Windows version of the application,
which is a rebranded media player that also installs a malware agent posing as a software
updater (mxiupdate.exe). A full write up of the Windows malware is not in scope of this article
for the sake of brevity and our intended contribution. A hash for the malware agent is

6/15

provided in the appendix for those interested. A cursory inspection of debugging artifacts and
other details, such as an embedded filesystem path referring to a template code project
(“EmbeddedAssembly_1.3”), suggests that the agent is both rudimentary and custom
designed.
One important trait worth noting is that the Windows malware’s communications strongly
resembles the malware connected to the domains disclosed by Kaspersky. These similarities
include same approach of communication beacons to a randomly-named path on the
attacker’s server, with the same URL parameters that contain similar types of values
(probably AES encrypted strings represented in base64, like the Android applications):
Bahamut’s Mixi Player malware (mxiplayer[.]com):
/hdhfdhffjvfjd/gfdhghfdjhvbdfhj.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=N/A&s=[string]&t=[string]
InPageCampaign malware (encrypzi[.]com):
/fdjgwsdjgbfv/dbzkfgdkgbvfb.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=0&s=[string]
These repeated parallels further indicate a relationship between the Android malware
operations and the InPage-related espionage. In review, these connections include:
Overlap between the extended network of domains relevant to Bahamut’s credential
theft infrastructure and malware domains in Kaspersky’s report;
Similarity in the format of beacons between Bahamut’s Windows agent and malware
associated with the InPage domains, and to a lesser extent even in the Android agent;
and,
Commonalities in targeted interests, namely the contested Kashmir region.
One curious trait of Bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its
espionage activities, rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with
legitimate software. These include translation and weather applications that involved
requests to third-party APIs and other user interactions. While much of the code appears to
be copied and these applications are simple, Bahamut must spend a fair amount of time on
operations that target a small number of individuals. The content and app market
descriptions of the three Android applications also recalls our previous observation that the
Bahamut actor appears to be fluent in English, albeit constrained either due to not being
native speakers or lack of professionalism.

Credential Theft in the Middle East
Bahamut has taken a more concerted effort to reduce exposure of their operations,
preventing the research techniques that led to our cataloguing of their infrastructure and
operations in the first post. Once again, the attempts all originate from less reputable hosting
companies and networks (AS44901, BelCloud Hosting Corporation). Spearphishing pages
7/15

are now more resistant to enumeration attempts and appear to use a dedicated subdomain
for one specific victim. The unique subdomain appears to be automatically disabled after the
“successful” phishing attempt in order to cover the trail of the attack (redirecting the user
elsewhere or appearing to be a Google error page). These pages have also increased their
use of unicode replacements for letters and other font tricks as a way to evade network filters
or to deceive users (e.g. using r and n, “rn”, to appear like the letter “m”). Altogether an
already stealthy actor has improved their operational profile.

Curiously, Bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing
attempts or to provoke the target to provide more passwords. These passwords are
hardcoded in the phishing page so that the login form will immediately return a “bad

8/15

password” message if entered. This could be designed to trick the user into providing older
passwords or alternative passwords used on other platforms to provide a foothold into other
services. The result is that Bahamut spearphishing pages include over two hundred possible
real world passwords that appear to cover at least a couple of dozen likely victims.
The theme of the passwords provide indication of the types of targets and victims of
Bahamut since our last encounter. Most of the domains clearly reflect a Middle Eastern
audience, including referring to individuals’ names (e.g. “al Khalifa”) and Emirati phone
numbers. Some of these passwords are cryptic – such as one referencing a supermarket in
Beirut. Others reference a “national bloc,” Gaza, the Dubai Expo in 2020, and a Saudi media
entity. More generally, these targets appear to include people or entities in the United Arab
Emirates, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, and Bahrain, among other Arab countries. Further
demonstrating its focus on the Middle East, the phishing page specifically (and exclusively)
checks if the visitor’s browser is set to the Arabic language and redirects them to a translated
page. Where targets are personally identifiable, these campaigns reflect an intimate
understanding of the relationships and members of the policy and international relations
sectors of certain Gulf states – information that would not be readily accessible to a
bystander, and targets that would not be of interest outside of political motivations.
The recent incidents also involved a social engineering tactic well documented in the
Kingphish report: fictitious social media profiles. In Kingphish, a profile active on LinkedIn,
Twitter, and Facebook (purporting to be an IT and business professional) approached labor
rights advocates requesting help on research about human trafficking.
Similarly, a fictitious LinkedIn profile named “Sophie Foster” attempted to simultaneously
approach multiple targets of Bahamut’s phishing messages. The Foster profile appears
crafted for a professional Middle East related demographic, claiming to have experience in
public relations and international trade. Among connections to SOAS and LSE students,
which appear to be cover related to her claimed educational background, the profile has a
clear theme in targets: journalists and public relations professionals in the Middle East,
including individuals at Sky News Arabia and Al-Masry Al-Youm, and others in Egypt,
Lebanon, Saudi, UAE, and Turkey. A two-year old Facebook profile exists for the persona,
which has liked pages for Lebanese politicians and has a Mail.ru account linked to it.

9/15

Bahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with SMS messages
purporting to be from Google about security issues on their account, including a class 0
message or “flash text.” These text messages did not include links but are intended to build
credibility around the fake service notifications later sent to the target’s email address. The
use of fake sender identifiers – especially combined with the unusual flash text approach –
could be effective, but once again Bahamut is betrayed by its unusual English.

Bahamut also appears to be more aggressive in reconnaissance against targets. As it
harvested potential addresses associated with targets, it would sended tailored or salacious
messages with image-based trackers to check if the message was opened. These provide a
10/15

metric as to whether the target is ignoring attacks, or whether the email address is not
monitored or active. The messages were crafted to a Middle East focused audience,
primarily posing as news stories or media outlets (e.g. Al Monitor) relevant to the region.

Conclusion and Implications
Given our increased confidence that Bahamut was responsible for targeting of Qatari labor
rights advocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other Gulf states, Bahamut’s
interests are seemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer. However, those
targets fall within coherent themes. It is unclear which single client could be interested in
both a Kashmiri organization on a terrorism watchlist and Egyptian journalists. Thus far,
Bahamut’s campaigns have appeared to be primarily espionage or information operations –
not destructive attacks or fraud. The targets and themes of Bahamut’s campaigns have
consistently fallen within two regions – South Asia (primarily Pakistan, specifically Kashmir)
and the Middle East (from Morocco to Iran). The targeting of organizations scrutinized ties to
terrorism raises the stakes for the operation, and differentiate it from usual cybercrime.
Targets outside of the Middle East tend to still have associations to Middle Eastern issues,
such as a European investment firm active in a Gulf country and a foreign policy experts in
the West. We have not found evidence of Bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its
limited geographic domains, although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its
compartmentalization of operations.
There remains ample questions and research opportunities to be explored. While Bahamut
has leveraged resources in Urdu and Arabic, it appears to be most comfortable in the
English language despite its uncommon grammar. While we note malicious domains that
maintain a similar profile to Bahamut that impersonate Qatari government email services, we
have not found a direct connection to those campaigns, and there has been little indication of
the targeting of Qatar within our monitoring. We have not fully explored the extent of
Bahamut’s operations, such as its Windows malware agent or possible other Android
malware. Moreover, the networks and tactics used within Bahamut’s operations turn up
suspicious sites that resemble the Times of Arab operation disclosed previously – often
Middle East focused news published in English that recirculate content on technology and
politics with no clear attribution or purpose. These suspicious sites and those we can

11/15

account for as Bahamut repeatedly turn up a nexus with India, more so than the Middle East,
despite attempts by the attackers to stay anonymous. Once again, our investigation only
seems to be a limited window into a strange operation.
The proposition that a non-state hacker-for-hire operation could be used in pursuit of regional
state interests is not unusual. At this point most Middle Eastern governments have at least
once procured cyber espionage capabilities from abroad, such as from the government
malware vendors FinFisher, NSO and Hacking Team. By one account, Qatar even sought to
outsource an offensive cyber program to American companies – a deal that was quashed by
the U.S. government. This reliance on contractors could indicate that such countries have
been unable to develop their own in-house capacity, which would align with their general
reliance on foreign military firms. It is also worth noting that while some government agencies
may have acquired tools already, other entities such as local police might still desire their
own capabilities leading to overlaps. On the vendor side, in recent years companies such as
the Indian-firm Aglaya have been implicated in selling full hacking as a service, rather than
simply providing tools for government use. This parallels the unclear lines between
cybercrime and espionage seen elsewhere, and hints that mercenary cyber operations are
more common than currently understood. Thus Bahamut warrants attention as an
emblematic case of the interest in cyber espionage in places such as the Middle East and
the range of vendors willing to meet that demand.

Acknowledgement
We appreciate the help from Tom Lancaster, who noticed the overlap with Kaspersky’s
InPage report and an additional Android malware agent. Our prior publication also failed to
acknowledge immensely valuable input from a number of colleagues, including Nadim
Kobeissi’s feedback on how the API endpoints on the Android malware were encrypted.
Thank you to everyone who contributed to this research and provided feedback.
