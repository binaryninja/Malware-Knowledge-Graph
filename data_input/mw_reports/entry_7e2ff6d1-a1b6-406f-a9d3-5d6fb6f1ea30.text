In a blog post dated February 16, 2022, ZeroFox Intelligence detailed Kraken, a new botnet
targeting Windows that we discovered in October 2021. The botnet is still undergoing active
development, experimenting with new features, and attempting to find a brand for itself. After
our publication, ZeroFox learned that the botnet has undergone a rebranding to more closely
align with its administration dashboard. Sometime between January 4, 2022, and January 7,
2022, the operator(s) began using the names “Anubis” and “Pepega” for the project
internally.

Recommendations
Ensure antivirus and intrusion detection software is up to date with all patches and rule
sets.
Enable two-factor authentication for all organizational accounts to help mitigate
phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
Maintain regularly scheduled backup routines, including off-site storage and integrity
checks.
Avoid opening unsolicited attachments and never click suspicious links.
Log and monitor all administrative actions as much as possible. Alert on any suspicious
activity.
Review network logs for potential signs of compromise and data egress.

ZeroFox Intelligence has been following the development of this previously unknown botnet
since October 2021. Originally named “Kraken,” builds discovered between January 4, 2022,
and January 7, 2022, reveal that the internal name has changed.

As seen in Figure 1, the Golang project path has changed from
“C:\Users\666\Desktop\Bobabubs\kraken_2022” to “\root\anubis”, which more closely
aligns with the dashboard after it received its own rebrand. The source code also appears to
have been merged into one main file with most of the function names being obfuscated, as
opposed to the previously separated but clear functionality. Another notable change made is
to the main source file. The name “pepega” may be in reference to a Twitch emote of the
same name, which is itself a variation of the meme “Pepe the Frog.”

Anubis Dashboard No Longer Available
Shortly after our publication, ZeroFox Intelligence also observed that the Anubis dashboard
is no longer available. Attempting to view the dashboard now results in a “404 page not
found” message being displayed.

New Exfiltration Targets
In addition to the previously-added cryptocurrency wallets, Anubis now appears to be
targeting specific Chromium-based browsers. Builds obtained by ZeroFox Intelligence from
February 17, 2022, onwards have added the following paths targeting the Brave, Google
Chrome, and Microsoft Edge browsers:
\AppData\Local\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\User Data\Default\Cookies
\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies

\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Cookies

Until recently, Anubis relied entirely on secondary payloads such as Redline to steal data
from victims. If this trend of feature additions continues, Anubis may become capable of
doing the job itself, ending its reliance on third-party infostealers.

Conclusion
The additional capability to target a victim’s browser data seems limited to just cookie data
currently. Whether Anubis decides to collect more data (such as saved credentials and
browser history) or even target more browsers based on the Chromium source currently
remains to be seen. Though the pace of Anubis’ development has slowed down since its
initial discovery, the various changes its operator(s) are making indicate they are still
deciding what the future of this botnet holds. ZeroFox will continue to monitor this emerging
botnet as it evolves.
