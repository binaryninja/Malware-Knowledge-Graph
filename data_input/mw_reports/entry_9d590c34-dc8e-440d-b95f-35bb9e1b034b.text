Summary
This threat can allow remote sophisticated attackers to gain access and perform backdoor
commands on an affected device. It is a modified DLL component of a legitimate software.
Attackers use this threat to gain initial access to a device. When the related software is
opened, this modified DLL is loaded and connects to command-and-control servers to listen
for commands and get additional payloads.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects this threat. It raises an alert when it detects the threat
on your device, but it doesn't automatically remediate it in order to not affect legitimate
services. If this threat is detected on your environment, we recommend that you immediately
investigate and manually remediate it.
NOTE: Microsoft continues to work with partners and customers to expand our knowledge of
the threat actor behind the nation-state cyberattacks that compromised the supply chain of
SolarWinds and impacted multiple other organizations. Microsoft previously used ‘Solorigate’
as the primary designation for the actor, but moving forward, we want to place appropriate
focus on the actors behind the sophisticated attacks, rather than one of the examples of
malware used by the actors. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the
actor behind the attack against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP
malware, and related components as NOBELIUM. As we release new content and analysis,
we will use NOBELIUM to refer to the actor and the attack campaigns.

1/2

Immediately isolate the affected device. If malicious code has been launched, it is likely
that the device is under complete attacker control.
Identify the accounts that have been used on the affected device and consider these
accounts compromised. Reset passwords or decommission the accounts.
Investigate how the affected endpoint might have been compromised. Check web and
email traffic to determine how the malware arrived.
Investigate the device timeline for indications of lateral movement activities using one
of the compromised accounts. Check for additional tools that attackers might have
dropped to enable credential access, lateral movement, and other attack activities.
