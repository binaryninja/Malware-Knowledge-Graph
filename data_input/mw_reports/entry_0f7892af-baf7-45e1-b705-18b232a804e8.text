Summary

1/16

Since at least 2015, threat actors have used HUI Loader to load remote access trojans (RATs) on
compromised hosts. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers link two HUI Loader
activity clusters exclusively to China-based threat groups. The BRONZE RIVERSIDE threat group
is likely responsible for one cluster, which focuses on stealing intellectual property from Japanese
organizations. The other cluster involves deployment of LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and
Pandora post-intrusion ransomware. CTU™ researchers attribute this activity to the Chinese
BRONZE STARLIGHT threat group.
The victimology, short lifespan of each ransomware family, and access to malware used by
government-sponsored threat groups suggest that BRONZE STARLIGHT’s main motivation may be
intellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial gain. The ransomware could
distract incident responders from identifying the threat actors’ true intent and reduce the likelihood
of attributing the malicious activity to a government-sponsored Chinese threat group.

HUI Loader overview
HUI Loader is a custom DLL loader whose name is derived from a string in the loader (see Figure
1). The malware is loaded by legitimate programs that are vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking.
HUI Loader decrypts and loads a third file containing an encrypted payload that is also deployed to
the compromised host. CTU researchers have observed HUI Loader loading RATs such as
SodaMaster, PlugX, Cobalt Strike, and QuasarRAT.

Since early 2021, CTU researchers observed threat actors deploying HUI Loader in a cluster of
activity associated with intellectual property theft. This A41APT campaign primarily targets
Japanese organizations and uses HUI Loader to load the SodaMaster RAT. The victimology and
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in this campaign align with BRONZE RIVERSIDE
activity. In mid-2021, CTU researchers began tracking a second cluster of activity that uses HUI
Loader to load Cobalt Strike Beacon and deploy ransomware. CTU researchers attribute this
second cluster of activity to the BRONZE STARLIGHT threat group. Figure 2 compares the clusters
linked to HUI Loader.

HUI Loader-linked ransomware activity
HUI Loader samples that load Cobalt Strike Beacon have been linked to LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook,
Night Sky, and Pandora ransomware activity (see Table 1).

In March 2022, CTU researchers analyzed an updated version of HUI Loader that uses the RC4
cipher to decrypt the payload. The malware sample also attempts to circumvent host-based
detection and protection measures by disabling Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW),

3/16

disabling Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) functions, and hooking Windows API calls (see Figure
3). CTU researchers identified code overlap between the updated HUI Loader samples and the
Pandora ransomware.

Ransomware C2 infrastructure
Analysis of the Cobalt Strike Beacon samples loaded by HUI Loader revealed a link between
AtomSilo, Night Sky, and Pandora ransomware. The Cobalt Strike Beacons were configured with
an uncommon HTTP POST URI beginning with /rest/2/meetings and a watermark value of 0 (see
Figure 4). As of this publication, CTU researchers have only observed this configuration in Cobalt
Strike Beacons associated with these ransomware families.

The configuration of these Cobalt Strike payloads is likely based on a modified version of a public
C2 malleable profile that configures the HTTP GET request URI as ‘/functionalstatus’ and the HTTP
POST URI as ‘/rest/2/meetings’. Table 2 compares the three Cobalt Strike Beacons.

Table 2. Cobalt Strike Beacon sample configuration information linked to ransomware activity.
In a January 2022 Secureworks incident response (IR) engagement, CTU researchers observed a
threat actor compromising a ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus server. The threat actor exploited
an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-40539) and deployed a Meterpreter reverse shell
that communicated with a C2 IP address (172 . 105 . 229 . 30). They then deployed three files to
the compromised host: a legitimate Microsoft Defender executable vulnerable to DLL search order
hijacking, a HUI Loader sample (mpclient.dll) that is loaded by the executable, and an encrypted
Cobalt Strike Beacon (dlp.ini). CTU researchers did not observe follow-on activity.
The C2 server also hosted a legitimate VMware executable (VMwareXferlogs.exe) vulnerable to
DLL search order hijacking. This executable loads a DLL (glib-2.0.dll) from the same directory. CTU
researchers were unable to obtain glib-2.0.dll from this C2 server but identified other glib-2.0.dll HUI
Loader samples that could be sideloaded by VMwareXferlogs.exe. An April 2022 third-party report
links glib-2.0.dll HUI Loader samples that load Cobalt Strike to LockBit ransomware. However,
there is not enough evidence in the report for CTU researchers to validate this claim.
The VirusTotal analysis service revealed URLs indicating the presence of glib-2.0.dll files on two
servers (45 . 32 . 101 . 191 and 45 . 61 . 139 . 38). Passive DNS data shows that 45 . 61 . 139 . 38
hosted sc . microsofts . net, which is a C2 domain that third-party reporting links to LockFile
ransomware activity. The 45 . 32 . 101 . 191 IP address hosted api . openssl-digicert. xyz, which
has sibling domain (peek . openssl-digicert . xyz) that is linked to Pandora ransomware.
While CTU researchers do not have access to these servers, timeline analysis suggests that two
HUI Loader samples uploaded to VirusTotal may have been hosted on these servers. Both samples
have compile timestamps that are the close to the ‘URL first seen’ timestamp listed on VirusTotal
(see Table 3). Although threat actors can trivially modify compile timestamps, the timeframe of the

5/16

associated intrusion activity makes it unlikely that these timestamps were altered. The two HUI
Loader samples that were possibly hosted on these servers share code with the Pandora
ransomware.

Ransomware TTPs and code overlap
CTU analysis indicates that the five ransomware families linked to HUI Loader were developed
from two distinct codebases: one for LockFile and AtomSilo, and the other for Rook, Night Sky, and
Pandora. Based on the order in which these ransomware families appeared starting in mid-2021,
the threat actors likely first developed LockFile and AtomSilo and then developed Rook, Night Sky,
and Pandora.
Third-party researchers leveraged code overlap between LockFile and AtomSilo to release a
decryptor for files encrypted with these ransomware families in October 2021. Other third-party
reporting describes TTP overlap in LockFile and AtomSilo intrusion activity. The overlap includes
identical filenames for the ransomware executable and components of the Kernel Driver Utility.
Table 4 lists feature similarities across Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora. These ransomware families
appear to leverage the Babuk ransomware source code. The Babuk source code was reportedly
leaked in September 2021, a few months before Rook operations began in December 2021.

Table 4. Similarities across Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora ransomware.
The use of HUI Loader to load Cobalt Strike Beacon, the Cobalt Strike Beacon configuration
information, the C2 infrastructure, and the code overlap suggest that the same threat group is
associated with these five ransomware families. It is likely that BRONZE STARLIGHT is
responsible for LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora intrusion activity.

Connections to China
As of this publication, CTU researchers have not linked HUI Loader to publicly available code and
have only observed HUI Loader usage in the A41APT campaign linked to BRONZE RIVERSIDE
and the post-intrusion ransomware activity linked to BRONZE STARLIGHT. BRONZE RIVERSIDE
(also known as APT10) is associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). A thirdparty report attributes LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, and Night Sky ransomware activity to a Chinese
threat group it calls DEV-0401. The discovery of links to PlugX and Chinese-language resources
associated with the ransomware activity further support the likelihood that BRONZE STARLIGHT is
based in China.
CTU analysis revealed four HUI Loader samples that decrypt and load PlugX RAT payloads. PlugX
is used by multiple Chinese threat groups. One of the HUI Loader-linked PlugX samples
communicates with hr . indiabullamc . com, which is a sibling domain of a BRONZE STARLIGHT
Cobalt Strike C2 domain (servers . indiabullamc . com). This Cobalt Strike Beacon sends HTTP
GET requests to /static/js/siteanalyze_2392.js (see Figure 5). CTU researchers identified four
additional Cobalt Strike Beacons that send HTTP GET requests to the same URI. One of these
Cobalt Strike Beacons communicates with cs . microsofts . net, which is a sibling of a Cobalt Strike
C2 domain (sc . microsofts . net) used by LockFile.

Secureworks)
The indiabullamc . com domain likely masquerades as the legitimate website for an India-based
company. A ransomware note uploaded to VirusTotal suggests that a company with a similar name
was a LockFile victim in July 2021. Analysis of the indiabullamc . com PlugX payload revealed that
it replaces the MZ signature in the MS-DOS header and the portable executable (PE) signature in
the PE header with ‘XV’. This PlugX variant uses the hard-coded value 0x20140307 to generate a
key to XOR-decrypt the PlugX configuration information (see Figure 6).

Figure 6. Analysis of PlugX sample linked to LockFile ransomware activity. (Source: Secureworks)
PlugX ‘XV’ samples can be grouped into sub-versions based on the hard-coded value in the
decryption routine. One of the other PlugX payloads loaded by HUI Loader was uploaded to
VirusTotal in 2017 and was not the same sub-version as the indiabullamc . com payload. The
remaining two samples were the same sub-version as the indiabullamc . com payload and were
observed in attacks targeting Southeast Asian organizations in April 2019. CTU researchers are
unable to corroborate the BRONZE RIVERSIDE attribution based on the information in the report,
but the TTPs align with Chinese threat group activity.

PlugX source code has allegedly been leaked online. However, it is unclear which variant was
leaked and if it has been used by threat groups outside of China. It is unlikely that the indiabullamc
.com PlugX sub-version is used widely across distinct threat groups or even across multiple
Chinese threat groups. The links connecting LockFile ransomware activity, HUI Loader, and a
specific PlugX sub-version associated with Chinese threat group activity suggest that the threat
group responsible for the HUI Loader-linked ransomware activity has access to malware developed
by Chinese government-sponsored threat groups.
During an October 2021 Secureworks incident response engagement, CTU researchers observed
likely ransomware precursor activity that overlapped with third-party reporting of LockFile activity.
The engagement revealed that the threat actors exploited the ProxyShell vulnerabilities in a
Microsoft Exchange server to deploy a web shell. They then ran a PowerShell wget command to
download an unidentified file from a server at IP address 45 . 91 . 83 . 176, which the third-party
report links to LockFile activity. This server with this IP address reportedly used a Chineselanguage configuration during the LockFile ransomware campaign. Although CTU researchers
cannot corroborate this claim, VirusTotal reported that the server returned a web page displaying an
error message in Chinese.
CTU researchers identified additional artifacts that indicate attribution to a Chinese-speaking threat
group. The inclusion of uncommon Subject DN and Issuer DN fields in an SSL certificate
associated with Pandora ransomware C2 infrastructure suggest it was likely generated following
instructions on a Chinese-language blog for setting up Cobalt Strike SSL certificates. CTU
researchers also detected a Chinese character font in a ransom note dropped by Night Sky
ransomware (see Figure 7).

Links between BRONZE STARLIGHT and BRONZE UNIVERSITY
A January 2022 Secureworks incident response engagement revealed that BRONZE STARLIGHT
compromised a server running ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and deployed HUI Loader with a
Cobalt Strike Beacon. CTU researchers observed the Chinese BRONZE UNIVERSITY threat group
active on the same network with overlapping timeframes. Around mid-November 2021, BRONZE
UNIVERSITY compromised this server to deploy ShadowPad malware and stayed active on the
network until January 2022. In addition to deploying ShadowPad, BRONZE UNIVERSITY
harvested credentials, moved laterally within the network, and compressed sensitive data for
exfiltration. The intrusion activity attributed to BRONZE STARLIGHT began in late November 2021
and ended in early December 2021.
CTU researchers did not observe additional BRONZE STARLIGHT activity after the threat actors
deployed and executed HUI Loader to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon. It is unclear why BRONZE
STARLIGHT suspended its intrusion activity. The simultaneous and continued operations by
another Chinese threat group on the same network suggests that the two groups may have
deconflicted their post-intrusion activity. This scenario assumes collaboration and knowledge

9/16

sharing between the groups. It could indicate that BRONZE STARLIGHT participates in
government-sponsored intelligence-gathering efforts rather than being a purely financially
motivated threat group.

Targeting and victimology
The operational cadence and victimology of LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora
deployments do not align with conventional financially motivated cybercrime operations. In each
case, the ransomware targets a small number of victims over a relatively brief period of time before
it ceases operations, apparently permanently (see Figure 8). The number of victims is unclear, as
leak sites often do not list victims who pay ransoms early.

Figure 8. Timeline of ransomware activity and number of victims listed on each ransomware leak
site. (Source: Secureworks)
Cybercrime groups sometimes rebrand their ransomware, often in response to law enforcement or
government actions. For example, the GOLD WATERFALL threat group rebranded its Darkside
ransomware to BlackMatter likely as a result of law enforcement scrutiny following the Colonial
Pipeline attack. Similarly, GOLD DRAKE made several changes to its Hades ransomware to hinder
attribution and enable victims to circumvent payment sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury
Department. Due to the overhead associated with retooling and the impact on revenue,
cybercriminals tend to only make these adjustments when they are necessary for continued
operations. These pressures typically do not apply to the BRONZE STARLIGHT ransomware
families. While the release of an AtomSilo and LockFile decryptor may have prompted the group to
create a ransomware family based on Babuk’s source code, the decision to limit the ransomware
use to brief, targeted deployments is likely to prevent security researchers from clustering activity
and identifying trends. The rapid changes in the ransomware landscape make it unlikely that
researchers will investigate obsolete ransomware.
BRONZE STARLIGHT operated LockFile as a traditional ransomware scheme but adopted the
name-and-shame model for the other ransomware operations. It is possible that the change
provided a more plausible means of exfiltrating data. The threat actors may also have decided that
the public profile would be more effective as a distraction from their true operational objectives.
Pandora is the only ransomware with a leak site as of April 14, 2022, listing five victims. Two earlier
victims were removed. Descriptions of each company include anonfiles . com links to ZIP files
containing allegedly stolen data.

10/16

As of mid-April, a total of 21 victims had been listed across the AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and
Pandora leak sites. CTU researchers estimate that approximately 75% would be of interest to
Chinese government-sponsored groups focused on espionage based on the victims’ geographic
locations and industry verticals. The victims include pharmaceutical companies in Brazil and the
U.S., a U.S.-based media organization with offices in China and Hong Kong, electronic component
designers and manufacturers in Lithuania and Japan, a law firm in the U.S., and an aerospace and
defense division of an Indian conglomerate. The five victims that were not likely targeted for
espionage include two real estate companies in the Americas, two small financial institutions in the
U.S., and a small interior design company in Europe. One victim of Rook ransomware was a bank
in Kazakhstan, which strongly suggests that the threat actors are not based in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS). There is an unspoken universal agreement among Russian-speaking
ransomware groups not to target entities in those jurisdictions.
The number and nature of LockFile victims is unclear. Third-party reporting suggests that victims
represented verticals such as manufacturing, financial services, legal, and engineering, and that
most were located in the U.S. and Asia. CTU researchers identified two victims that are consistent
with the targeting of a Chinese government-sponsored espionage-focused threat group: a financial
services organization in India and a local government entity in the U.S.
Victimology does not provide conclusive attribution. Chinese government-sponsored threat groups
have broad targeting, so any ransomware operation could include victims of potential Chinese
interest. Conversely, Chinese government-sponsored groups using ransomware as a distraction
would likely make the activity resemble financially motivated ransomware deployments. However,
the combination of victimology and the overlap with infrastructure and tooling associated with
government-sponsored threat group activity indicate that BRONZE STARLIGHT may deploy
ransomware to hide its cyberespionage activity. While Chinese government-sponsored groups have
not historically used ransomware, there is precedent in other countries. For example, North Korea
deployed WCry (also known as WannaCry) for financial gain, the Russian IRON VIKING threat
group used NotPetya for its destructive capabilities, and the Iranian COBALT FOXGLOVE threat
group used Pay2Key and N3tw0rm ransomware as a destructive wiper against entities in Israel.
BRONZE STARLIGHT likely uses ransomware in these incidents to achieve the following tactical
objectives:
Destroy evidence: Encrypting data destroys forensic evidence of espionage activities, making
it much more challenging for victims to properly assess the threat and protect themselves.
Distract investigators: Ransomware can significantly impact a compromised organization and
can consume all incident response efforts. Pressure to return to normal business operations
could prevent victims from detecting suspicious activity that does not directly relate to the
ransomware.
Exfiltrate data: Name-and-shame ransomware exfiltrates data, with an emphasis on
proprietary or sensitive information. As this data is also targeted in espionage operations, the
ransomware operation could mask the threat actors’ motivation.

11/16

Conclusion
BRONZE STARLIGHT compromises networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in network perimeter
devices, including known vulnerabilities for which patches are available. The threat actors deploy
HUI Loader to decrypt and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon for command and control. They then
deploy ransomware and exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim’s environment.
Both the exploitation of known vulnerabilities and the use of the Cobalt Strike for command and
control provide opportunities to detect and prevent BRONZE STARLIGHT intrusion activity before
exfiltration or ransomware deployment. Network defenders should implement a robust patch
management process to address network perimeter vulnerabilities in a timely manner. However,
breaches can occur even with preventative measures in place. Reactive measures such as a
robust and tested incident response plan, real-time network monitoring and alerting, and an
extended detection and response (XDR) solution are crucial for minimizing the impact of
ransomware and other malicious activity.
