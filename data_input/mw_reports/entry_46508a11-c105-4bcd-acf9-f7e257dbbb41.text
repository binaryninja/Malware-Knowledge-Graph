Cybereason vs. RansomEXX Ransomware
cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-ransomexx-ransomware

Over the last few months, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team has been tracking the activity
around the RansomEXX ransomware. It has been active since 2018, but came to fame in
2020 in attacks on major organizations such as the Texas Department of Transportation.
RansomEXX started as a Windows variant, but a Linux variant was discovered earlier this
year.

Key Findings
Human-operated targeted attacks: RansomEXX is being used as a part of multi-staged
human-operated attacks targeting various government related entities and tech companies. It
is being delivered as a secondary payload after initial compromise of the targeted network.
Disables security products: The Windows variant has a functionality that was seen before
in other ransomware, disabling various security products for a smooth execution on the
infected machine.
Multi-Platform: RansomEXX started solely as a Windows variant, but later a Linux variant
was added to the arsenal, sharing similarities with its predecessor.
Fileless ransomware: RansomEXX is usually delivered as a secondary in-memory payload
without ever touching the disk, which makes it harder to detect.

Detected and prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the
RansomEXX ransomware.

Background
TheRansomEXX family, also known as Defray777 and Ransom X, runs as a solely inmemory payload that is not dropped to disk, making it highly evasive. RansomEXX was
involved in three major attacks in 2020 against Texas TxDOT in May of 2020, against Konica
Minolta in the end of July, and against Brazil's court system in the beginning of November.
In addition, last December RansomEXX operators published stolen credentials from
Embraer, one of the largest aircraft makers in the world, on its own leaks website as part of
the ongoing double extortion trend.
In mid 2020, a Linux variant of RansomEXX emerged. This variant, despite sharing
similarities with the Windows variant, is simpler than its predecessor and lacks many
features such as disabling security software and command and control communication.
There are decryptors for both variants, and the threat actors send paying victims a private
key to decode their files.

RansomEXX Analysis
This analysis focuses on the Windows variant of RansomEXX, which can be classified as
fileless malware because it is reflectively loaded and executed in memory without touching
the disk. Analysis of this sample reveals that it is partially obfuscated but includes indicative
information such as the “ransome.exx” string that can be seen hard coded in the binary:

Upon execution, RansomEXX starts decrypting some strings necessary for its operation:

The mutex the malware creates is generated from the GUID of the infected machine:

The decrypted strings at this point include mainly logs:

Decrypted logging string
RansomEXX spawns a separate thread in the background to handle the logging process.
When debugging the sample, the logs themselves can be seen in the console:

The malware then continues with terminating processes and system services that may
interfere with the execution, but excludes those that are relevant for its execution:

Some of the terminated services as well as processes excluded from termination
Cybereason detects the execution of RansomEXX together with the below listed commands
that are executed post-encryption. These commands’ role is to prevent the victim from
restoring their system by deleting backups, Windows error recovery etc. Cybereason also
detects this malicious usage of Windows utilities:

After preparation of the environment RansomEXX encrypted the files on the victim’s machine
and the following note is left on the machine:

the victim’s files, and can also be observed clearly in the sample’s code:

Cybereason Detection and Prevention
Cybereason detects the Windows utilities that are executed post-encryption as malicious and
triggers a Malop(™) for all of them:

Defense Platform
Looking at the Malop that was triggered by fsutil, the evidence for malicious activity can be
seen together with the suspicions mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix:

When Cybereason anti-ransomware prevention is turned on, the execution of the
RansomEXX is prevented using the AI module:
