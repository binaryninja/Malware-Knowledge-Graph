Executive summary
The Trellix Email Security Research Team has discovered a malicious campaign targeting
government agencies of Afghanistan, India, Italy, Poland, and the United States since 2021.
The attack starts with a spear phishing email with a geo-political theme. The spear phishing
emails were themed around India Afghanistan relationship. Attacker used politics as a lure to
trick users into clicking on a malicious link. The email used for this phishing attack contains an
attachment or a weaponized URL that delivers an Excel sheet. Upon opening the Excel sheet,
Excel executes an embedded malicious macro which then decrypts and installs a Remote
Access Trojan (AysncRAT & LimeRAT) and maintains persistence. Once the Remote Access
Trojan is installed on the victim machine, it establishes communication with a Command-andControl server used to exfiltrate victim data. The Remote Access Trojan is capable of taking
screenshots, capturing keystrokes, recording credentials/confidential information, and adding
infected systems to botnets. It can also perform network discovery and move laterally to other
systems in the affected organization. The email used in this attack originated from the South
Asia region which suggests the involvement of a South Asian threat actor. Trellix Email
Security has detection coverage for this malicious campaign.

Threat landscape
The Trellix Email Security product can follow the entire attack chain and analyze the final
payload. In this scenario, it followed the chain: EMAIL -> URL -> ZIP -> XLS -> Macro. Finally,
our threat database was able to detect the malicious macro performing decryption, creating an
executable object, performing process injection, and utilizing other malicious techniques. Trellix
Email Security has detection for the malicious Excel sheet with name FE_APT_Dropper_Macro_DoubleHide_1.

Attack timeline
As seen in Figure 2, the attack was active for over a year. The attacker sent emails for a short
interval and then went back into hiding. This was followed by subsequent similar waves. The
first wave of attack was noticed during March-April 2021, followed by another in July 2021,

then again in December 2021, and most recently during end of March 2022.

Email details
The attackers used the free mail service Gmail to send the spear phishing emails. Based on
email header analysis, it was evident that the emails originated from Google servers and were
sent from the South Asia region. The time zone of the email sender (+0500 UTC) further
suggests the involvement of South Asian threat actors.

Figure 3. Email headers
The spear phishing email was themed around geopolitical news related to India like "Indian
Nationals ( who were hidden in Kabul ) Killing in Kabul Tonight" and “Indian workers
missing from the dam project.” More recently, the email used a COVID theme with the
subject - "31 Covid Deaths In 24 Hours: Information campaign by NDTV". The email had a
Google drive link serving a malicious ZIP file. In some cases, the malicious ZIP was sent as an
email attachment. The ZIP contains an Office document which is used to drop a RAT (Remote
Access Trojan).

Figure 5. Attack chain

Technical details
The document file (DOC/XLS) acts as a dropper, which drops and executes a file named
"msword.exe". The Excel sheet contains a VBA macro which is enabled when the document
file is opened. The malicious executable code is stored in the document file itself (within a form
text field) in the base64 encoded format. The VBA macro reads the base64 content, decodes
it, and then decrypts the decoded content with a hardcoded XOR key. Multiple levels of base64
decoding and XOR decryption are used to obfuscate the malicious executable file.

as shown in Figure 10.

igfx.exe

Delphi compiled file installs RAT file according to available .Net version

Upon execution, "msword.exe" drops the RAT files shown in the table above. These RAT
executables are obfuscated using “Crypto Obfuscator For .Net”. “msword.exe” then starts the
process “igfx.exe” which performs the following actions:
Checks the .NET version in the registry; based on the installed version, renames the
compatible RAT file to “excel.exe”
Checks the registry keys to determine the .NET version in the order listed below. If found,
a version of the runtime file (AsyncRAT) is picked corresponding to the .NET version. If
none of the registry keys are found, the file “3_5” (LimeRAT) is used.

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4.5
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4.5.1

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4.7

Sets the file attributes of “excel.exe” to hidden and read-only.
Adds a “Run” registry entry for persistence.
Deletes the unused RAT executable files.
Starts the “excel.exe” process.
