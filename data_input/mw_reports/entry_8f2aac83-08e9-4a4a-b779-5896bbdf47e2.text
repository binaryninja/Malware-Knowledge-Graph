Executive Summary_
Importantly,
business is
taking cyber
security
seriously

The 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey: Systems of National Interest was designed and conducted to
obtain a better understanding of how cyber incidents are affecting the Australian businesses that form part of
Australia’s systems of national interest, including critical infrastructure.
These businesses and industries underpin the social and economic wellbeing of the nation and deliver
essential services, including banking and finance, communications, energy, resources, transport and water.
The findings from this survey provide a picture of the current cyber security measures these businesses have
in place; the recent cyber incidents they have experienced; and their reporting of them. These findings also
provide baseline data from which the results of future annual surveys can be compared, to help ascertain
overall trends.
Importantly, business is taking cyber security seriously. This is paramount for the security of the individual
organisation and its clients, as well as the industry sector, and the business community more broadly.
However, the survey results also indicate that many organisations are not confident that cyber security is
sufficiently understood and appreciated by staff, management and boards.
In terms of cyber security incidents, more than half the organisations considered attacks on their organisation
to be targeted. This indicates a shift from previous views or conceptions, that most attacks are non-targeted
or indiscriminate. And while the majority of attacks were reported to come from external sources, the fact
that 44% originated from within organisations serves as a reminder that internally-focused cyber security
controls and measures are also important.
Reporting of cyber security incidents – which is critical to the effectiveness of the government-business
partnership – clearly requires further attention. The CERT needs to articulate to business the benefits of
reporting cyber security incidents to CERT Australia and to law enforcement, and that all information provided
to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.

Key findings

Over 90%
of respondents
deployed
firewalls,
anti-spam filters
and anti-virus
software

The key findings for this survey include:


over 90% of respondents deployed firewalls, anti-spam filters and anti-virus software



two-thirds of respondents had documented incident management plans, however only 12% had a
forensic plan



nearly two-thirds of organisations used IT security related standards



over two-thirds of respondents had staff with tertiary level IT security qualifications. Over half had vendor
IT security certifications, whilst just under half had non-vendor IT security certifications



over 20% of organisations know they experienced a cyber incident in the previous 12 months, with 20%
of these organisations experiencing more than 10 incidents.

Of the organisations which know they experienced cyber incidents:


17% suffered from loss of confidential or proprietary information, 16% encountered a denial-of-service
attack, and 10% financial fraud



44% reported the incident to a law enforcement agency, whereas only 13% sought a civil remedy
through action from legal counsel



20% chose not to report the matter to a law enforcement agency because of the fear of negative publicity



the most common responses as to why incidents were successful, were that they used powerful
automated attack tools, or exploited unpatched or unprotected software vulnerabilities or misconfigured
operating systems, applications or network devices



over half of all organisations have increased their expenditure on IT security in the previous 12 months.

Introduction_
The 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey:
Systems of National Interest was commissioned by
Australia’s national computer emergency response
team, CERT Australia (the CERT), part of the
Federal Attorney-General’s Department.
This report provides analysis of the findings, and identifies areas for further exploration or improvement
which may be addressed in future surveys. As there was a strong response rate of almost 60% for this
inaugural survey, the findings are considered to be representative of this particular sample. The strong
response rate also indicates a good level of trust between the CERT and its business partners.
Established in 2010, the CERT works with the Australian business sector – primarily the owners and
operators of systems of national interest. These are the businesses that underpin the social and economic
wellbeing of the nation and the economy, such as banking and finance, communications, energy, resources,
transport and water.
The CERT provides cyber security threat and vulnerability information to help these businesses manage
risk, as well as providing support with incident response. The CERT is also a member of the Cyber Security
Operations Centre and the global CERT community. By using its government, international and industry
networks, the CERT seeks to provide the most effective and timely advice and assistance possible.

CYBER CRIME & SECURITY SURVEY REPORT 2012

About the survey_
The survey was designed to obtain a better picture of how cyber incidents are affecting the businesses
that partner with the CERT. It was produced by the Centre for Internet Safety at the University of Canberra.
More information on the Centre can be found at www.canberra.edu.au/cis. The Centre was created to foster
a safer, more trusted internet by providing thought leadership and policy advice on the social, legal, political
and economic impacts of cybercrime and threats to cyber security. The survey was hosted by the Online
Research Unit.
Participating organisations were asked that an appropriate person complete the survey, and were assured
that all responses are anonymous.
The survey consisted of 24 questions, both closed and open ended, to ascertain:


business description



types of IT security used



types of cyber security incidents experienced, and



industry reporting of incidents.

Respondents_
The strong
response rate
of almost 60%
reflects
the trusted
relationship
CERT Australia
has with its
business partners

Of the almost 450 organisations contacted, responses were received from 255, which is approximately 60%.
This is a strong response rate and reflects the trusted relationship the CERT has with its business partners.
It also reflects the willingness of business to participate in a survey that will help government and improve
understanding of the cyber security threat environment in Australia.

Industry sector
More than 11 industry sectors responded, with the greatest representation being from energy (17%),
defence industry (15%), communications (12%), banking and finance (9%) and water (9%).
Figure 1 provides a breakdown of the sectors – with ‘government’ referring to state-owned enterprises and
‘other’ referring to companies from aviation/aerospace, business services and insurance.

Trusted Information Sharing Network
The Trusted Information Sharing Network for Critical Infrastructure Resilience (TISN) is led by the Federal
Attorney-General’s Department. It provides an environment where business and government can share
information on security issues relevant to the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure, and the
continuity of essential services in the face of all hazards. The TISN has seven main sector groups – banking
and finance, communications, food, energy, health, transport and water.
Disruption of Australia’s systems of national interest or critical infrastructure could have a range of serious
implications for business, governments and the community. It is vital that owners and operators of these
important organisations, both in the private and public sector, are able to plan for, withstand and respond to a
broad range of threats, including cyber attacks from outside and inside their organisation.
One third of respondents reported their organisation to be a member of the TISN. This included organisations
from banking, energy, communications, transport and water. This provides a mostly representative picture of
the TISN sectors that partner with the CERT. One third of respondents reported their organisation was not a
member of the TISN, while one third of respondents did not know if their organisation is a member.
Figure 2 provides a breakdown of industry sectors, according to whether or not the respondent identified the
organisation as being a member of the TISN.

Security of IT systems_
Security of IT systems centers on preventing and detecting the unauthorised access to or use of IT systems
or impairment of those systems. To achieve such security, modern organisations layer security defences in IT
systems to reduce the chance of a successful attack. This concept is known as defence-in-depth and seeks
to manage risk with multiple defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defence turns out to be inadequate,
another layer of defence will hopefully prevent a full breach. The multiple defence mechanisms layered across
an organisation’s network infrastructure protect data, networks, and users. A well-designed and implemented
defence-in-depth strategy can help system administrators identify internal and external attacks on a computer
system or network.

IT security technology
Organisations were asked what type of computer security technologies they used. More than 90% of
respondents reported using antivirus software, spam filters, and firewalls. More than 80% also reported
using access control and virtual private networks (VPNs).
IT security technology such as firewalls and spam filters are not always effective in preventing or detecting
sophisticated attacks, so security techniques are increasingly incorporating the use of intrusion detection
systems (IDS). Almost 60% of respondents reported using a type of IDS.
Almost half the respondents also reported deploying reusable passwords and multifactor authentication
technologies such as biometrics, smartcards and tokens.
These results indicate that some organisations may need to strengthen their IT security, by adopting a
defence-in-depth approach.
Figure 3 provides a breakdown of the security technology being used by respondents.

IT security policy
According to respondents, basic security policies are being applied by the majority of surveyed organisations.
For example, 84% deploy user access management, 79% perform media backup, 75% use documented
standard operating procedures, and 73% have external network access control.
Results indicate there are areas for improvement. For example, less than 50% of respondents have plans in
place for the management of removable computer media, such as USB memory drives, and less than 25%
have policies and procedures in place for using cryptographic controls.
In addition, less than 12% of respondents reported having a forensic plan in place. These plans help monitor use of
the ICT systems, provide mechanisms to recover lost data, and provide ways to protect information on systems.

layer security

IT systems

Of the respondents who reported their organisation did apply some form of IT security standard, almost 50%
followed or used as a guide, the ISO 27001. This standard states it is mandatory for management to examine
their organisation’s IT security risks to form a risk mitigation system, and to ensure that the controls applied
are current for the needs of the business.
Of this same subset of respondents, just over 20% reported their organisation adhered to the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DDS). This is the IT security standard commonly used by organisations
using credit card data. In addition, just over 15% used a vendor specific standard.

IT security qualifications
Responses indicated that 65% of participating organisations had IT security staff with tertiary level IT
qualifications. More than 50% of participating organisations had IT security staff with some type of vendor
based IT certifications. Almost 35% of participating organisations had IT security staff with no formal training,
although most of these staff had more than five years working in the IT security industry.

These findings indicate that some organisations may need to improve the skill set of their IT security staff.
This was supported by the additional finding that 55% of respondents thought their organisation needs to do more
to ensure their IT security staff have an appropriate level of qualification, training, experience and awareness.
These findings indicate that respondents are aware of the need for IT security staff to keep their skills and
knowledge up to date – which is essential, as cyber threats are constantly evolving.
Respondents also thought their organisation needs to do more to ensure other staff have an appropriate level

of IT skill and awareness:


70% of respondents reported this need for general staff



70% of respondents reported this need for management, and



48% of respondents reported this need for their board of directors.

These findings indicate that respondents are aware that cyber security is a shared responsibility. Even where
networks are secure at the perimeter, security is dependent on all staff being aware of vulnerabilities such as
phishing attacks. This is a method used to penetrate organisations without needing to breach IT security defences,
by attempting to get staff to divulge information and provide access – unwittingly – to corporate systems.
These findings also indicate that many organisations are not confident that cyber security is sufficiently
understood and appreciated by staff, management and boards.

Respondents were asked about the types of cyber security incidents their organisation had experienced in the
previous 12 months, as well as possible motives for the attacks, and why the attacks may have been successful.
A cyber security incident was classified as an electronic attack that harmed the confidentiality, integrity or
availability of the organisation’s network data or systems.

Number of incidents experienced
When asked if their organisation had experienced a cyber security incident in the previous 12 months:


69% of respondents reported ‘no’



22% of respondents reported ‘yes’, and



9% of respondents reported they ‘did not know’.

While these results indicate the majority of organisations did not experience a cyber incident in the previous
12 months, this may more accurately reflect that a number of cyber intrusions have gone undetected by
some organisations. Anecdotal evidence available to the CERT suggests that some businesses are unaware
of the full scope of unauthorised activity on their networks.
The CERT is also aware of hesitation from organisations to report a cyber security incident. This may be for a
variety of reasons – some are concerned that the information they report may lead to negative publicity and/
or regulatory scrutiny, others don’t consider reporting to be worthwhile.
Of the respondents who reported their organisation had experienced an incident in the previous 12 months:


65% reported experiencing one to five incidents



21% reported experiencing more than 10 incidents



9% reported experiencing six to 10 incidents, and



5% did not know how many incidents had been experienced.

Figure 9 provides a percentage breakdown of the number of cyber security incidents experienced by
organisations in the previous 12 months.

Types of incidents experienced
Of the respondents who reported their organisation had experienced a cyber incident in the previous
12 months, the main types reported were:


theft of a notebook, tablet or mobile devices – 32%



virus or worm infection – 28%



trojan or rootkit malware – 21%



unauthorised access – 18%



theft or breach of confidential information – 17%, and



denial-of-service attack – 16%.

These findings may help organisations decide where to place additional resources to protect their information
assets. The high percentage of physical computing assets being stolen highlights the need for physical
security measures to be included in an organisation’s security risk management plan.
Interestingly, although respondents were provided with 13 specific types of incident from which to choose –
34% of respondents reported the incidents their organisation had experienced were ‘none of the above’. As
the types of incident were comprehensively listed, this finding may be due to the respondent not knowing
what type of incident was actually experienced.
Figure 10 provides a breakdown of the type of cyber security incidents experienced by organisations in the
previous 12 months.

Of the respondents who knew they had suffered electronic attack, 71% reported they had been subject to
between 1 and 5 external attacks, whilst 44% reported they had been subject to between 1 and 5 internal
attacks. Many companies spend the majority of their IT security budget on protection from external attacks. But
the figures above serve as a reminder that internal controls and measures are also important, to ensure that
internal risks are also managed. Should they have sufficient motivation – financial, personal or cause-related –
internal employees, whether they are permanent or casual staff or contractors, can have access to sensitive
information and the opportunity to understand critical systems and exploit potential weaknesses in security.

Building

incidents
requires constant
vigilance by IT
security staff

Motives for the attacks
Respondents were asked what they thought the motives for the incidents were. The highest suspected motive
was non-targeted unsolicited malicious damage (17%), followed by indiscriminate attack (almost 16%).
Interestingly, more than half the respondents viewed the attacks to be targeted at their organisation – with
motives being illicit financial gain (15%), hactivism (9%), using the system for further attacks (9%), using the
system for personal use (6%), being from a foreign government (5%), personal grievance (5%), and being a
competitor (4%).
This finding indicates a shift from previous views or conceptions, that most attacks are non-targeted or
indiscriminate.
Either way, building resilience to cyber security incidents requires constant vigilance by IT security staff, in
order to create and apply current and efficient risk treatments.
Attribution is always difficult. Where respondents think an attack may have come from, may not be where it actually
came from. What’s important is that an organisation understands enough about attacks so they can work out:


the vulnerabilities on their network exploited by the attacker



what data may have been accessed, and



what needs to be done to increase the protections of that network.

organisations in the previous 12 months.

case study – Ransomware_
In late September 2012, CERT Australia received a series of calls from more than 25 organisations being
targeted by ransomware.
The attacks encrypted files on the compromised system and/or locked the victim out of the desktop
environment. The attacks also encrypted files in the system backups.
The victims were then asked by the attacker to pay a fine using a payment or money transfer service, to
obtain the codes that would unlock the computer and/or decrypt the data.
In some cases, the ransomware included scareware, displaying a fake warning screen, claiming that the victim’s
computer had been associated with criminal activity. This was a tactic to discourage the victim from reporting
the attacks to law enforcement agencies or the CERT. For example, one warning screen was set up to look like
it was from the Anti Cyber Crime Department of the Federal Internet Security Agency. There is no such agency.
In the majority of cases, the attackers used Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol as an entry point to the
target network. This was possibly using authentication credentials obtained by key loggers, or accessing
systems with weak credentials.
The severity of the damage done by the attacks varied across the target organisations. In the worst case scenario
reported to the CERT, one victim lost 15 years’ worth of critical business data, which is a serious compromise.

22

CYBER CRIME & SECURITY REPORT 2012

So how does the CERT help business deal with such attacks?
Firstly, it worked directly with the affected organisation to help it better defend against the attack. Where the
organisation had outsourced management of its website, the CERT helped the service provider protect the
affected network.
The CERT also worked with law enforcement locally – because of the criminal nature of the activity;
Microsoft – to share data and analysis; and international colleagues – as the threat actors or attackers used
infrastructure based overseas.
In addition, the CERT identified other organisations in Australia that had not yet reported the activity. It then
contacted them to warn the attacks were happening in their sector, and then gave them advice about how to
protect their systems.
The CERT also issued a guidance paper on the ransomware threat, which was made publicly available on
its website.
This case study highlights the nature of CERT Australia’s mission – it’s all about helping business best prepare
for and respond to cyber attacks. It does this by using its government, industry and international partnerships
to provide the most useful advice possible – as soon as possible.

Contributing factors to the attacks
Respondents were asked what factors they thought may have contributed to the incidents. The highest
rated reason was the use of powerful automated attack tools (14%), followed by exploitation of unpatched or
unprotected software vulnerabilities (11%), and exploitation of misconfigured operating systems, applications
or network devices (10%).
These findings highlight the need for organisations to stay vigilant to vulnerabilities and apply appropriate
mitigations – specifically where misconfigured systems are the reason an attack was successful.

It’s important to

Australia before

occurs

Case study – distributed denial-of-service_
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most serious threats to organisations with an
online presence.
Historically, these attacks had non-financial motivations, aiming to bring attention to certain events or protest
specific issues. The more recent trend, however, is for DDoS to be used for extortion.
Early in 2012, CERT Australia received reports from a range of Australian financial companies that were being
targeted by extortion-based DDoS attacks. They had been called and threatened with an attack against their
website, unless they made a payment.
This type of attack can cause serious problems. It can not only disrupt the company’s online activities via its
website, it can also stop clients from doing business with them online.
The attackers chose their targets carefully. They combed victim websites for pages that would generate the
most processing in order to increase the likelihood of successfully taking down the site. Some websites were
brought down by the attack; others had the infrastructure to withstand it.
The CERT located the target list for the attacks and contacted the listed companies. As the attacks were of
a criminal nature, the CERT also provided all relevant information to the Australian Federal Police’s High Tech
Crime Operations for investigation.

28

CYBER CRIME & SECURITY SURVEY REPORT 2012

The sites which had the ability to mitigate the attack were not targeted for long. With the attacks being
financially motivated, the attacker seemed quick to move on to other potential victims. However, if the
company communicated with the attacker, the site appeared on the target list for longer periods of time.
The CERT was able to identify the international source of the attacks from a sample of the DDoS traffic
provided by one of the companies – this highlights the value of sharing information. The CERT then notified
its international counterpart, asking for assistance in having the control hub taken down. The international
CERT responded quickly and the host was shut down.
However, as is normally the case with such incidents, the control hub then moved to another internet address and
recommenced attacks. The CERT again contacted overseas counterparts to issue further take down requests.
The CERT also continued to follow up with affected companies, providing options and advice on mitigation
techniques for possible future attacks. The companies that were most effective in mitigating the attacks had
already well-established and tested response procedures in place for dealing with DDoS.
This case study highlights the need for organisations to develop DDoS response plans and test them. By
partnering with the CERT – ideally before an incident occurs – business can be better prepared to mitigate
cyber attacks.

reporting of incidents_
It’s important
and necessary for
business to
report cyber
incidents to CERT
Australia...

confidence

Respondents who indicated their organisation had experienced cyber attacks in the previous 12 months,
were asked a range of questions about reporting the incidents.
Just under half the respondents (44%) said they had chosen not to report the incidents to an outside
organisation. Of the respondents who did report one or more incidents, 44% were to a law enforcement
agency, and 29% were to the CERT.

These findings indicate a high level of caution from organisations in reporting incidents – although they may
also reflect the actions of the respondent, rather than the overall practice of the organisation.
When asked why they had chosen not to report a cyber security incident to a law enforcement agency, 74%
indicated that they didn’t think the incident/s warranted law enforcement intervention. This response may
indicate the incident/s suffered by these organisations were of a minor level and/or they were unaware of the
threshold level for interest and acceptance for investigation by a law enforcement agency. In addition, 35% of
organisations didn’t believe law enforcement had the capability to effectively conduct an investigation into the
incident, while 26% didn’t think the perpetrator would get caught.

...the benefits
of reporting
cyber security
incidents to
CERT Australia
and to law
enforcement...

Out of those respondents who did report a cyber security incident to law enforcement, 33% stated that it
was their understanding the incident was not investigated and 29% stated they did not know the outcome
from the referral, while 8% of matters referred to law enforcement were reported to have resulted in a
person being charged.

These findings highlight that the CERT needs to articulate to business the benefits of reporting cyber security
incidents to CERT Australia and to law enforcement, and that all information provided to the CERT is held in
the strictest confidence.

Case Study – Criminal Investigation
In 2009, the Australian Federal Police received information regarding the unauthorised modification of data at
a Western Australian government department. The subsequent investigation revealed two males who were
contractors to the department, sharing information regarding the illegal access to the departmental computer
operating system.
The investigation revealed communications between the two males pertaining to the creation of malicious
software and subsequent commands to hack network security controls in an attempt to crack a file and reveal
the user-names and passwords of departmental staff.
The AFP executed search warrants at both males’ addresses and seized a number of computers and
associated media. Both males were subsequently charged with conspiracy to cause an unauthorised
modification of data held in a computer, knowing the modification to be unauthorised, and being reckless
as to whether the modification impaired the reliability, security or operation, of any such data and the
modification is caused by means of a carriage service, contrary to section 11.5(1) and sub-section 477.2(1)
of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).
Upon appearing at Court, both males pleaded not-guilty to the above offence. Following a trial, they were
both found guilty. One of the offenders was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment to be released after
having served 10 months and the other to 36 months to be released after having served 12 months, both to
enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 20 and 24 months respectively.

About CERT Australia_
The CERT
encourages
business to be
prepared before
an incident
occurs

As Australia’s national computer emergency response team, the CERT works to ensure that all Australians
and Australian businesses have access to information on how to better protect their information technology
environment from cyber based threats and vulnerabilities.
The CERT is the initial point of contact for cyber security incidents impacting on Australian networks.
The CERT is keen to highlight and reinforce the importance of business taking cyber security seriously. This
not only means being aware of cyber threats but also putting effective controls and safeguards into practice.
In Australia, it’s now publicly acknowledged that cyber operations are one of the most rapidly evolving threats
to our national security.
The CERT encourages business to be prepared before an incident occurs. This involves a business knowing
its network, understanding the value of its information, and understanding how both are protected.
As general guidance, the CERT advises business to use the Top 35 strategies for mitigating cyber intrusions,
released by the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD). This list is informed by DSD’s experience in operational
cyber security, including responding to serious cyber incidents and performing vulnerability assessments
and penetration testing for Australian Government agencies. While the first four strategies have the potential
to mitigate up to 85% of attacks, this information does need to be tailored to suit the needs and operating
environment of each business.
The CERT also encourages business to understand what constitutes normal behaviour on its network. By
knowing this, the business is more likely to detect unusual behaviour.

Being prepared before an incident occurs also involves having operational relationships in place with those
who can assist, such as the CERT and law enforcement agencies. Having such contacts already established
helps with the efficient and effective sharing of information for prevention – and if necessary, mitigation.
Reporting incidents to the CERT is necessary and important. It allows the CERT to make sure that businesses
receive the right help – and all information provided to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.
The CERT is the entry point into government for Australian businesses. It works in the Cyber Security
Operations Centre, sharing information with other key agencies including the Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation, the Australian Federal Police and the Defence Signals Directorate. The CERT also works closely
and shares information with its international counterparts.
This means the CERT is very well connected and very well informed, which is a great asset in helping
businesses protect themselves from cyber attacks. The CERT is also a strong point of referral, which can lead
to some very positive outcomes in terms of resolution and prosecution.
As such, the important messages for businesses are to:


continue taking cyber security seriously by implementing effective controls



partner with the CERT before an incident occurs, and



report cyber incidents to the CERT.

To report an incident
