Intel® Hardware-based Security
Technologies for Intelligent Retail Devices
Based on 4th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors

Intelligent devices are transforming the world of retail by bringing the convenience,
variety, and ease of use of the Internet shopping experience into the store.
Traditional and mobile point of sale (POS) devices with Internet connectivity share vast
amounts of data and enable retailers to use the power of data analytics to support
informed business decisions. Digital signs, interactive kiosks, POS terminals and
interactive vending machines based on Intel® architecture have the intelligence to run
anonymous viewer analytics through Intel® Audience Impression Metrics Suite (Intel® AIM
Suite) and transform consumer experiences with relevant messaging delivered through
rich and compelling graphics and video. “Digital Wallet” applications enable shoppers to
make transactions on in-store devices using their smartphones.
Protecting intelligent retail systems, and the customer and transaction data they
generate, against malware, theft, and other attacks has never been a more critical issue
for retailers. Intel security capabilities are now available to help retailers meet a broad
range of threats.

Introduction

Protecting intelligent retail
systems, and the customer and
transaction data they generate,
against malware, theft, and
other attacks has never been a
more critical issue for retailers.

Intelligent retail devices are designed to
aggregate, analyze, and share data so
retailers and their customers can conduct
transactions and make informed decisions.
Beyond traditional point of sale (POS)
devices and cash-and-carry registers
with Internet connectivity, today’s new
generation of retail systems now includes
mobile intelligent POS systems, interactive
digital signs, interactive kiosks, and
interactive vending machines. In addition,
some devices are equipped with Intel AIM
Suite for anonymous viewer analytics.
It is no exaggeration to say that all of
the data shared by intelligent devices in
retail has great value to retailers and their
customers and is therefore sensitive in
nature. Devices including POS terminals,
interactive vending machines and ATMs
are used to perform financial transactions,
retrieve customer information, loyalty

identification and inventory information.
Interactive digital signs carry viewer
analytics data, targeted advertising
messages, and applications for content
management. Intelligent devices inside the
store, including intelligent signs and kiosks,
share data with the retailer’s inventory
database and are used to support mobile
POS applications.
The sharing of this high-value retail data
is spawning a spectrum of sophisticated
threats, ranging from data theft and
identity theft to the display of malicious
digital graffiti intended to harm retail
brands on digital signs or interactive
devices. Attackers are using firmware to
gain access to a device’s operating system
and applications, in addition to creating
viruses and malware that can disable
a retail system or provide thieves with
access to sensitive data.

Intel® Hardware-based Security Technologies
for Intelligent Retail Devices

Protecting systems, networks, and data
itself is a critical challenge for the retail
industry. As the industry prepares to
address threats with existing softwarebased security solutions, Intel provides
a comprehensive range of security
capabilities built-in to hardware. These
security capabilities begin at the platform
level and include protection of the BIOS,
firmware, and platform hardware itself.
Intel takes a comprehensive approach
to platform, software, and data security
and readers should understand that
the platform technologies described in
this paper complement other securityrelated components of Intel® vPro™
technology, including Intel® Active
Management Technology (Intel® AMT)1,
Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel®
VT)2,and Intel® Trusted Execution
Technology (Intel® TXT)3. Intel’s platform
security technologies are also designed
to complement comprehensive software
security solutions from McAfee* designed
to protect systems against attacks,
viruses, and malware, including providing
security protection below the operating
system. For details about these Intel
security technologies, please refer to the
resources section at the conclusion of this
paper.
Intel’s platform security technologies
provide the foundation for protecting data
integrity, availability and confidentiality.
Retailers can modify their existing
security solutions to take advantage of
the hardware features of systems based
on Intel Core processors, or they can
use software solutions that have been
optimized for use with Intel’s hardwarebased security capabilities, giving them
hardware-enhanced security.
This paper provides an overview of the
hardware-based security technologies
enabled by 4th generation Intel Core
processors that can help address security
threats in retail:

•  Intel® Data Protection Technology
with Intel® AES New Instructions
(Intel® AES-NI): hardware-accelerated
data encryption and decryption, with
high levels of processing performance
for secure and responsive user
experiences.
•  Intel® Platform Protection Technology
with BIOS Guard: hardware-assisted
authentication and protection against
BIOS recovery attacks.
•  Intel® Platform Protection Technology
with Platform Trust: integrated
solution for credential storage and key
management for Microsoft Windows* 8.
•  Intel® Platform Protection Technology
with Boot Guard: authenticated code
module (ACM)-based secure boot that
verifies a known and trusted BIOS is
booting the platform.
•  Intel® Identity Protection Technology
with Near Field Communication (NFC):
identity protection for customers using
NFC enabled smartphone or smartcard
in “Tap-and-Pay”, “Tap-to-Authenticate’,
or “Tap-to-Connect“ use cases with their
personal systems to securely access
online services and e-commerce.

Intel® Data Protection Technology
with Intel® AES New Instructions
(Intel® AES-NI)
Intel AES New Instructions refer to the
set of instructions available with the Intel
4th generation Intel Core processor family.
The instructions enable rapid and secure
data encryption and decryption based on
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
as defined by FIPS Publication No. 197.
AES is currently the dominant block cipher
used in various protocols, and the new
instructions are valuable for a wide range
of applications. Although the instructions
were first introduced in 2010 with Intel®
microarchitecture formerly code-named
‘Westmere,’ the 4th generation Intel Core

processor family enables performance
improvements targeted at up to 15
percent with approximately 25 percent
lower design power (TDP) compared to
previous generation Intel processors
(source: Intel). Intel AES New Instructions
are supported on Intel® Core™ i5 and i7
processors only.

Intel’s platform security
technologies are also designed
to complement comprehensive
software security solutions from
McAfee* to protect systems
against attacks, viruses, and
malware, including providing
security protection below the
operating system.
The architecture includes instructions
that offer full hardware support for
AES. Four instructions support AES
encryption and decryption, and two other
instructions support AES key expansion.
The instructions accelerate the execution
of AES algorithms by using hardware
to perform some of the performance
intensive steps of the AES algorithm.
A seventh instruction allows carry-less
multiplication.
The performance improvement that can
be achieved with Intel AES-NI depends on
the specific application and the proportion
of application time spent in encryption
and decryption. At the algorithm level,
using Intel AES-NI can provide a significant
speedup of AES. For non-parallel modes
of AES operation such as CBC-encrypt,
Intel AES-NI can provide a 2-3 fold gain in
performance over a completely software
approach. For parallelizable modes such
as CBC-decrypt and CTR, Intel AES-NI can
provide a 10x improvement over software
solutions (source: Intel). Performance
improvements apply to typical AES

implementations, including standard key
lengths, standard modes of operation, and
even some nonstandard or future variants.
AES instructions also provide important
security benefits. By running in dataindependent time and not using tables,
they help to eliminate the major timing
and cache-based attacks that can threaten
table-based software implementations
of AES. The instructions also simplify AES
implementation by reducing code size
and reducing the risk of accidentally
introducing security flaws. Because
Intel AES-NI perform the decryption
and encryption completely in hardware
without the need for software lookup
tables, Intel AES-NI can lower the risk of
side-channel attacks.

Retail use case: disk encryption protects data against theft,
without compromising system performance
Disk encryption using Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) can be
applied to all retail devices including POS terminals, kiosks, mobile POS devices,
interactive vending machines, ATMs, and interactive digital signage. These
devices store data related to software, content relating to advertisers, and
user data. Disk encryption is used to protect this valuable data. In some
devices, advertising content continuously plays in the background while it
acquires new data relating to anonymous viewer demographics. Kiosks in malls,
airports, and train stations handle customer logins and process transactionrelated data.
Information is continuously being fed into the system while the device
continues to display user-friendly advertising and informational content, which
places heavy processing demands on the system. Moving disk encryption
to hardware using Intel AES-NI can reduce the software application-based
workload while simultaneously providing more security.

Intel® Platform Protection
Technologies
Intel® Platform Protection Technology
with BIOS Guard
A device’s BIOS is contained in a privileged
space that is invisible to anti-virus
software. In addition, malware infecting
BIOS remains persistent, and it does not
go away even after a cold boot.

To avoid detection, attackers are now
digging deeper into the platform.
Vulnerabilities in System Management
Mode (SMM) and System Management
Interrupt (SMI) handlers have been
identified. The complexity of SMM
hardware and software makes it very

likely that BIOS update vulnerabilities
will continue to be exploited in the future.
For this reason, platform security begins
with the BIOS.
Intel® Platform Protection Technology
with BIOS Guard, a new feature on

Intel® Platform Protection Technologies

4th generation Intel Core processors
(U-series), ensures that updates to system
BIOS flash and Embedded Controller
(EC) flash are secure. BIOS updates are
cryptographically verified by the BIOS
Guard module, using a protected agent
running in AC-RAM (Authenticated Code
RAM), to perform authentication and
updating of flash control hardware.

RETAIL USE CASE:
hardware-assisted
authentication protects
against unauthorized
BIOS updates
BIOS Guard helps to ensure
that connected retail systems
are updated only with correct
firmware provided by the device
manufacturer. Retail devices are
customized with OEM specific
information in addition to the
retailer’s proprietary data.
Unauthorized access to devices
allows hackers to attack a
system.

For EC updates, BIOS Guard employs early
BIOS POST provisioning of a random secret
that is shared between the CPU and the
EC. The BIOS Guard module uses this value
to identify itself to the EC, which will
reject all protected operations without
this identification.
Each protected component of a BIOS Guard
protected BIOS update is cryptographically
signed by the device manufacturer,
checked, or signed and checked, before
it is allowed to update a system. BIOS
Guard helps ensure that malware stays
out of the BIOS by blocking all softwarebased attempts to modify protected BIOS
without the platform manufacturer’s
authorization.

POS terminals, interactive
vending machines, and ATMs are
typically serviced by a variety
of technicians, and OEMs need
to ensure that only authorized
personnel are allowed to
update the device’s BIOS or
EC. BIOS Guard will ensure that
only OEM-authorized BIOS and
firmware is updated, regardless
of who performs the update.

As shown in Figure 1, BIOS Guard
addresses SMM vulnerabilities by
strengthening the update trust boundary.

Intel® Platform Trust technology (Intel®
PTT) is a platform functionality for
credential storage and key management
used by Microsoft Windows 8. It supports
Windows 8 secure and measured boot
and supports all the Microsoft mandatory
commands for Trusted Platform Module
(TPM) 2.0 v.0.88. It is an integrated
solution in the Intel® Management Engine
for 4th generation Intel Core processors
for ultra-low TDP (ULT) platforms.
This integrated solution provides a
secure trust element to meet Windows
8 Connected Standby (CS) requirements
with reduced power consumption in
ultra-low power state S0iX environments.
Functional integration reduces BOM cost
and board real estate requirements.
Intel Platform Protection Technology
with Boot Guard technology works with
Intel PTT, reducing the complexity of the
Windows 8 boot process and meeting
all Windows 8 requirements. Boot
Guard protects against boot block-level
malware and provides an added level of
hardware-based platform security to
prevent repurposing of the platform to run
unauthorized software. The technology

is rooted in a protected hardware
infrastructure and is designed to prevent
the execution of an unauthorized boot
block. An Authenticated Code Module
(ACM) is provided by Intel and signed
to the hardware. When invoked by the
processor on platform reset it executes in
protected AC-RAM space.
Boot Guard covers three configurable boot
types:
• Measured Boot measures the Initial Boot
Block (IBB) into the platform protected
storage device such as Trusted Platform
Module (TPM) or Intel PTT.
• Verified Boot cryptographically verifies
the platform IBB using the boot policy
key.
• Measured +Verified Boot measures and
verifies the IBB.

Retail use case: an
authenticated code module
(ACM) verifies that a known
and trusted BIOS is booting
the platform
Boot Guard technology addresses
the threat of viruses and malware
by ensuring that only authorized
firmware and an authorized
operating system are running on
the system.
In mobile POS (mPOS) devices
running Windows 8, using Boot
Guard technology reduces BOM
cost by avoiding the need for a
discrete trusted platform module
while providing the same level of
security through measured and
verified boot.

Intel® Identity Protection
Technology with NFC
Originally designed for desktop, notebook,
and Ultrabook™ devices, Intel® Identity
Protection Technology (Intel® IPT) is now
available in intelligent retail devices based
on 4th generation Intel Core processors.
Intel IPT is suite of four technologies:
One Time Password, Protected
Transaction Display, Embedded PKI and
Near Field Communications (NFC). The
identity protection technologies address
identity theft by introducing a second
factor of authentication that relies
on a tamper resistant area within the
intelligent hardware.
This paper introduces Intel IPT with NFC
as an identity protection solution for
customers using the “Tap-and-Interact”
use case to interact with a digital sign,
vending machine, and other devices. For
details about other IPT technologies,
please refer to the resources section at
the conclusion of this paper.
NFC is a short-range wireless
communication technology with a protocol
for peer-to-peer data exchanges between
two endpoints. The current usage model
for NFC enables customers to connect to
a device to interact, exchange data, checkin, set up a transaction, scan devices, and
pay for a product by tapping their NFCenabled smart card or smartphone against
a NFC sensor in a retail device, then
complete the transaction, with positive
identity confirmation protected through
cryptographic binding. All this is done
through a software application running on
the OS.
Intel IPT includes similar use cases for
NFC such as “Tap-to-Pay” and “Tap-toAuthenticate” capabilities which enable
users to securely access online resources
and e-commerce payments simply tapping
their smart card on their NFC-enabled
PC. Intel IPT use case for NFC as “Tap and
Interact” allows secure interaction

with interactive devices. Intel IPT is an
integrated chipset-based security feature
that introduces security by isolating the
data received by NFC from the operating
system. Intel’s solution adds value by
introducing an integrated secure element
in the chipset within the retail device.

Retail use case: identity
protection for retail
customers using smart
cards and smartphones
‘Tap-to-Connect’ with a retail
device using a smartphone
is becoming a popular way
for customers to use their
smartphones to download
electronic coupons from digital
signage in an airport or mall,
obtain movie tickets, get loyalty
information in stores, check-in
to transit venues, and perform
non-payment transactions using
a broad range of interactive
devices.
With current NFC usage models,
downloading user identity data
from a smartphone is processed
by the OS-based application
running on the intelligent device.
Malware may be able to hack the
system and retrieve the user’s
identity.
Intel® Identity Protection
Technology (Intel® IPT) with NFC
changes this paradigm. After a
user taps to connect using their
smartphone, the information is
transferred to Intel® Management
Engine (Intel® ME) on the retail
device. Intel IPT introduces
protection of data received by
NFC by isolation. The OS is not
aware of data used in transaction,
preventing potential malware
from gaining access to the
customer’s identity information.
