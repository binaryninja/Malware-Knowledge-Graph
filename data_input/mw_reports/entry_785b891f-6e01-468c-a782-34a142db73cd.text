Summary
While tracking a suspected Iran-based threat group known as Threat Group-2889[1] (TG-2889), Dell SecureWorks
Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers uncovered a network of fake LinkedIn profiles. These convincing profiles
form a self-referenced network of seemingly established LinkedIn users. CTU researchers assess with high
confidence the purpose of this network is to target potential victims through social engineering. Most of the legitimate
LinkedIn accounts associated with the fake accounts belong to individuals in the Middle East, and CTU researchers
assess with medium confidence that these individuals are likely targets of TG-2889.

Fake LinkedIn accounts
The 25 fake LinkedIn accounts identified by CTU researchers fall into two categories: fully developed personas
(Leader) and supporting personas (Supporter). The table in the Appendix lists details associated with the accounts.
The level of detail in the profiles suggests that the threat actors invested substantial time and effort into creating and
maintaining these personas. The photos used in the fake accounts are likely of innocent individuals who have no
connection to TG-2889 activity.

Leader personas
Profiles for Leader personas include full educational history, current and previous job descriptions, and, sometimes,
vocational qualifications and LinkedIn group memberships. Of the eight Leader personas identified by CTU
researchers, six have more than 500 connections (see Figure 1).

The results of open-source research conducted by CTU researchers provided compelling evidence that the Leader
profiles were fraudulent:
One of the profile photographs is linked to multiple identities across numerous websites, including adult sites.
The summary section in one profile is identical to the summary in a legitimate LinkedIn profile, and the
employment history matches a sample résumé downloaded from a recruitment website.
In another profile, a job description was copied from genuine Teledyne and ExxonMobil job advertisements.
The job description in yet another profile (see Figure 2) was copied from a legitimate job posting from a
Malaysian bank (see Figure 3).

Five of the Leader personas purport to work for Teledyne, an American industrial conglomerate. In addition, one
claims to work for Doosan (an industrial conglomerate based in South Korea), one for Northrop Grumman (a U.S.
aerospace and defense company), and one for Petrochemical Industries Co., (a Kuwaiti petrochemical manufacturing
company).

Supporter personas
Profiles for Supporter personas are far less developed than for Leader personas. They all use the same basic
template with one simple job description, and they all have five connections (see Figure 4). Profile photographs for
three of the Supporter personas appear elsewhere on the Internet, where they are associated with different,
seemingly legitimate, identities. As with the Leader profiles, open-source research indicates that the Supporter
profiles are also fake.

Building credibility via endorsements
The purpose of the Supporter personas appears to be to provide LinkedIn skills endorsements for Leader personas,
likely to add legitimacy to the Leader personas. As shown in Figure 5, most of the Supporter accounts identified by
CTU researchers have endorsed skills listed on the profiles of the Leader personas. Although unable to view Leader
personas' LinkedIn connections, CTU researchers suspect the threat actors use the Supporter accounts to provide
the Leader profiles with an established network, which also enhances credibility.

Novel technique
Although CTU researchers identified eight Leader profiles, two appear to be duplicates that have different identities
associated with the same account. While CTU researchers were analyzing the profiles, the threat actors altered two
of the Leader LinkedIn accounts. The original profile name and photograph were replaced with a new identity, and the
current job was updated: in one case replacing Teledyne with Northrup Grumman (see Figure 6) and in the second
replacing Teledyne with Airbus Group.

alphanumerical LinkedIn ID, a1/7b/955, remains the same. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Changing personas associated with existing profiles was a clever exploitation of LinkedIn functionality because the
new identities inherit the network and endorsements from the previous identity. These attributes immediately make
the new personas appear established and credible, and the transition may prevent the original personas from being
overexposed.

Targeting LinkedIn users
Creating a network of seemingly genuine and established LinkedIn personas helps TG-2889 identify and research
potential victims. The threat actors can establish a relationship with targets by contacting them directly, or by
contacting one of the target's connections. It may be easier to establish a direct relationship if one of the fake
personas is already in the target's LinkedIn network.

5/9

Five of the Leader personas claim to be recruitment consultants, which would provide a pretext for contacting targets.
TG-2889 likely uses spearphishing or malicious websites to compromise victims, and established trust relationships
significantly increase the likelihood of these tactics being successful.

Targets
Seemingly legitimate LinkedIn users have also endorsed Leader personas. Endorsements are granted by
connections, indicating that these legitimate users are part of the Leader personas' networks. Therefore, they are
likely TG-2889 targets. Examination of the profiles associated with the endorsements revealed 204 potential TG-2889
targets. As shown in Figure 7, most are based in the Middle East.

A quarter of the targets work in the telecommunications vertical; Middle Eastern and North African mobile telephony
suppliers feature heavily. A focus on these types of targets may indicate that TG-2889 is interested in acquiring data
held by these organizations or gaining access to the services they operate. A significant minority of identified targets
work for Middle Eastern governments and for defense organizations based in the Middle East and South Asia.

Attribution
Based on strong circumstantial evidence, CTU researchers assess that TG-2889 is linked to the activity that Cylance
described in its December 2014 Operation CLEAVER report. The report documented threat actors using malware
disguised as a résumé application that appeared to allow résumés to be submitted to the industrial conglomerate
Teledyne. Cylance reported the use of the following domains, which reference companies associated with many of the
fake LinkedIn profiles identified by CTU researchers:
Teledyne-Jobs.com
Doosan-Job.com
NorthropGrumman.net

Cylance attributed the Operation CLEAVER activity to a threat group operating at least in part out of Iran. CTU
researchers have not uncovered any intelligence that contradicts this assessment. Furthermore, the strong focus
suggested by the endorsement analysis on targets from Arab states in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
region is in line with the expected targeting behavior of a threat group operating out of Iran.

Ongoing threat

6/9

Updates to profile content such as employment history suggest that TG-2889 regularly maintains these fake profiles.
The persona changes and job alterations could suggest preparations for a new campaign, and the decision to
reference Northrup Grumman and Airbus Group may indicate that the threat actors plan to target the aerospace
vertical.
It is likely that TG-2889 maintains personas that have not yet been identified, and that other threat groups also use
this tactic. CTU researchers advise organizations to educate their users of the specific and general risks:
Avoid contact with known fake personas.
Only connect to personas belonging to individuals they know and trust.
Adopt a position of sensible caution when engaging with members of colleagues' or friends' networks that they
have not verified outside of LinkedIn.
When evaluating employment offers originating from LinkedIn, seek confirmation that the individual is legitimate
by directly contacting the individual's purported employer.

Organizations may want to consider policing abuse of their brand on LinkedIn and other social media sites. If an
organization discovers that a LinkedIn persona is fraudulently claiming an association with the company, it should
contact LinkedIn. Creating false identities and misrepresenting an association with an organization is a breach of
LinkedIn's terms and conditions.

Table 1 lists details associated with Leader and Supporter personas created by TG-2889. The pairs shaded in dark
gray are different identities associated with the same LinkedIn account. The only difference in the profile links of the
shared accounts is the persona name.
