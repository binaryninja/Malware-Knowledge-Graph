A new strain of ransomware named Lilocked or Lilu has affected thousands of Linux-based
servers all over the world. The ransomware started infecting servers back in mid-July but in
the last two weeks, the attacks have become more frequent.
The very first case of Lilocked ransomware came to light when a user uploaded a
ransomware note on ID Ransomware, a website used for identifying the name of
ransomware from the ransomware note or demand specified in the attack.
It targets servers and gains its root access. The mechanism behind how it gets access in
unknown yet.
According to a Russian forum, bad actors might be targeting Linux-based servers that are
running defunct Exim software.

Demand – 0.03 Bitcoin
After a server has been attacked, the files are locked with “.lilocked” file extension.

The note accompanied with the encrypted files reads: “I’ve encrypted all your sensitive
data!!! It’s a strong encryption, so don’t be naive to restore it;)”

Upon clicking the link in the note, users are redirected to a website on the dark web,
prompting them to enter the key in the note. When the affected user enters the key, they are
asked to deposit 0.03 bitcoin or $325 in the Electrum wallet to get their files decrypted.

Linux Ransomware Does Not Affect System Files
Lilock ransomware does not affect system files but files with extensions including HTML,
SHTML, JS, CSS, PHP, INI, and other image formats. Since system files are not affected,
Linux systems are running normally.
As per Benkow, a French security researcher, Lilock ransomware has affected 6,700 servers
to date. Most of these servers are cached in Google search results. However, the number of
infected servers could be much more as there are many infected Linux servers that are not
indexed on Google.
Since the mechanism behind the ransomware is not known yet, there isn’t a security
advisory. You might evade this attack by keeping strong passwords and updating the apps as
and when security patches arrive.
