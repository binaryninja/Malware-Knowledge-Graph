out there

Introduction
I recently found a wave of malicious spam (malspam) that started as early as Monday 201803-05 at 18:28 UTC and lasted through at least Tuesday 2018-03-06 at 14:44 UTC. This
wave of malspam had Word documents as file attachments, and these Word docs had
macros designed to infect Windows hosts with ransomware. When I checked Monday
evening, I infected one of my lab hosts with GlobeImposter ransomware. When I checked
Tuesday morning, I saw GandCrab ransomware.
This is interesting, because in 2018, I've seen very few examples of mass-distribution
malspam pushing ransomware. So far in 2018, such malspam has been pushing mostly
information stealers, backdoors, and cryptocurrency miners. So it's always noteworthy when
I find something like this.
Today's diary examines this wave of malspam, the infection traffic, and associated indicators.

1/10

Shown above: Flow chart for an infection from this malspam.
The emails
Patterns for these emails were consistent, but I couldn't match them to a specific campaign.
Sending addresses, subject lines, email headers, and message text were all varied. The
only consistent part of this malspam was the Word document attachments, which were all
named " Resume.doc" with a space before the first letter. And even then, each attachment
had a different file hash.

The attachments
The attachments were typical Word documents with malicious macros. They work similar to
malicious macros seen in other malspam campaigns, using Powershell to retrieve a malware
binary to infect a vulnerable Windows host.

3/10

Shown above: One of the attached Word documents.
The traffic
Infection traffic from Monday evening showed indicators of GlobeImposter ransomware.
After the macro used Powershell to retrieve the ransomware binary from a server at
198.100.119.11, I saw an HTTP request to psoeiras.net for an IP address check. The URL
to psoeiras.net was similar to what I've documented before with GlobeImposter ransomware
infections.

Shown above: Traffic from an infection filtered in Wireshark on Monday evening (US time).
When I checked again Tuesday morning, I saw the same URL to 198.100.119.11 for a
ransomware binary However, this time, the follow-up HTTP request for the IP address check
went to nomoreransom.coin, with follow-up DNS queries for nomoreransom.bit and
gandcrab.bit. These domains are typical for what I've previously documented with
GandCrab ransomware.

Forensics on an infected Windows host
The GandCrab ransomware sample didn't encrypt any files on my lab host, but the
GlobeImposter binary did. All files encrypted by the GlobeImposter sample used a .gif file
extension. Previous samples of GlobeImposter I'd tested in December 2017 used
Read__ME.html for the decryption instructions, but this 2018 sample used Read__ME.txt.
The GlobeImposter decryptor seen through my Tor browser had a visual upgrade with a nice
background image, but it still had the same basic setup as before.

Shown above: Encrypted files on a Windows host infected with GlobeImposter.

Shown above: GlobeImposter decryption instructions.

6/10

Shown above: GlobeImposter decryptor viewed on a Tor browser.
The GlobeImposter infection stayed persistent on my infected lab host through the Windows
registry. Like many malware samples I've seen, this one used the
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key. However, the
binary used for persistence was not the same binary used during the initial infection. The
persistent binary for this GlobeImposter infection was only 22,528 bytes.

Final words
Although ransomware is down compared to last year, every once in a while we still see a
wave of malspam like this, pushing recent ransomware families seen in prior massdistribution campaigns. So far in 2018, GlobeImposter and GandCrab are the only ones I've
seen in mass-distribution malspam. However, these recent samples don't seem to be any
more dangerous now than they were before.
As always, properly-administered Windows hosts are unlikely to get infected. To infect their
computers, users would have to ignore multiple warnings to retrieve and activate the
malicious Word document, which includes bypassing Protected View. System administrators
and the technically inclined can also implement best practices like Software Restriction
Policies (SRP) or AppLocker to prevent these types of infections.
