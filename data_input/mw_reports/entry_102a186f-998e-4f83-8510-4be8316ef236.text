A major vulnerability in Confluence‚Äôs team collaboration server software is currently on the
cusp of widespread abuse after mass scanning and initial exploitation was spotted this week.
Tracked as CVE-2021-26084, the vulnerability impacts Confluence Server and Confluence
Data Center software that‚Äôs usually installed on Confluence self-hosted project management,
wiki, and team collaboration platforms.
Under the hood, the vulnerability resides in OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language), a
simple scripting language for interacting with Java code, the underlying technology in which
most Confluence software has been written.
When it released patches on August 25, last week, Atlassian, the company that owns the
Confluence software family, said the vulnerability could be exploited by threat actors to
bypass authentication and inject malicious OGNL commands that allow them to take over
unpatched systems.
As a result, the vulnerability was assigned a severity score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10, as
it allowed remote exploitation over the internet and because the complexity of developing a
weaponized exploit was considered low.

Exploitation starts a week after patches
On Tuesday, Vietnamese security researcher Tuan Anh Nguyen said that mass scans for
Confluence servers are currently underway, with attackers and professional bug bounty
hunters probing Confluence systems for functions vulnerable to CVE-2021-26084 attacks.

Soon after mass exploitation was spotted in the wild, two security researchers, Rahul
Maini and Harsh Jaiswal, also published an in-depth explanation of the bug on GitHub, which
also included several proof-of-concept payloads.
In a tweet, Maini described the process of developing the CVE-2021-26084 exploit as
‚Äúrelatively simpler than expected,‚Äù effectively confirming why the bug received its high 9.8
severity score.

With Confluence being a wildly popular team collaboration software inside some of the
world‚Äôs largest corporations, and with the CVE-2021-26084 vulnerability being extremely
powerful from a threat actor‚Äôs perspective, attacks from criminal groups are expected to ramp
up in the following days.
Confluence bugs have been widely weaponized before, so a similar exploitation pattern is
expected this time as well.
On its website, Atlassian claims that Confluence is used by more than 60,000 customers,
including the likes of Audi, Hubspot, NASA, LinkedIn, Twilio, and Docker.
