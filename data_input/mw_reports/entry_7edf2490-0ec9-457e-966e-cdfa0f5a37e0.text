XPCTRA Malware Steals Banking and Digital Wallet User's Credentials
1. Introduction
While hunting some phishing emails these days, I came across a malware
campaign similar to EngineBox, a banker capable of stealing user credentials
from multiple banks [1]. XPCTRA, as I call today’s variant, in addition to banking
data, steals online digital wallet users’ credentials from services such as
Blockchain.info and PerfectMoney.
The malspams used in the campaign try to induce the victim to open a
supposed bank bill link. It actually leads to the download of the XPCTRA
dropper, that is, the part of the malware responsible for environment recognition
and downloading new components. Once executed, it initiates a connection with
an Internet address to download other malware parts responsible for later
malicious actions.

In this diary, I present the XPCTRA analysis the indicators of compromise used
in this campaign.
2. Threat analysis
Unlike the previous variant, XPCTRA (read it like “expectra”) does not make use
of as many layers of encoding as EngineBox did to try bypassing security
layers, which made the analysis simpler.
Look at the diagram shown in Figure 1 and the textual description below to
understand the threat flow, from malicious e-mail to data theft:
The infection vector (malspam) links to a supposed PDF invoice, which
actually leads the victim to download an executable file (dropper);
Once executed, the dropper downloads a “.zip” file, unzips and executes
the malware payload;

It then begins a series of actions, including:
Persists itself into the OS, in order to survive system reboot;
Changes Firewall policies to allow the malware to communicate
unrestrictedly with the Internet;
Instantiates “Fliddler”, an HTTP Proxy that is used to monitor and
intercept user access to the financial institutions;
Installs the Fiddler root certificate to prevent the user from receiving
digital certificate errors;
Points Internet Browsers settings to the local proxy (Fiddler);
Monitors and captures user credentials while accessing the websites
of 2 major Brazilian banks and other financial institutions;
Stolen credentials are sent to criminals through an unencrypted C&C
channel;
Establishes an encrypted channel to allow the victim’s system to be
controlled by the attackers (RAT);
Monitors and captures user credentials while accessing email
services like Microsoft Live, Terra, IG and Hotmail. These accesses
are used to spread the malware further;

NOTE: The XPCTRA sample analysed here (idfptray.exe) was not yet known by
VT (VirusTotal) until my submission.
3. Quasar RAT
After posting EngineBox malware analysis [1] last month, through community
feedback, I came to know that the threat embedded a framework called Quasar
RAT [2] developed in C#. The goal of this framework is to provide a tool for
3/6

remote access and management of Windows computers— hence the name,
RAT (Remote Access Tool).
It turns out the variety of functions the open-source framework has, such as
remote desktop, keylogger, etc., made it quite attractive for cybercriminals who
ended up using it as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) tool within their malware.
Notice in Figure 2 the similarity of Quasar RAT directory tree on the left, and the
XPCTRA code on the right.

In addition to Quasar, XPCTRA incorporates Fiddler to play the role of HTTP
Proxy and, of course, the code responsible for intercepting communications with
financial institutions and sending SPAM as well.
4. Digital currency wallets
In addition to banking credentials, XPCTRA is able to steal digital currency
wallet’s credentials hosted online like Blockchain.info, PerfectMoney and
Neteller. Look at Figures 3 and 4 for code snippets of capturing moments and
sending user credentials from some of these institutions.

5. Final words
The result of this analysis draws our attention to the security of digital currency
wallets, especially those “hosted” in the cloud. Just as customers of traditional
financial institutions have faced over the years the most diverse fraud attempts
and had to protect themselves, so should digital money users. Give preference
to services that offer a second authentication factor for transactions and be sure
to enable it.
