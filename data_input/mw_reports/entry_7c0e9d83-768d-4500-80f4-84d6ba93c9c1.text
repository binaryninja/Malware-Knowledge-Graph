A new Amnesty International investigation has identified a campaign of spyware attacks
targeting Vietnamese human rights defenders (HRDs) from February 2018 to November
2020. Amnesty International’s Security Lab attributes these attacks to an
attack group known as Ocean Lotus. The group has been active since at least
2014, targeting the private sector and HRDs.
The spyware attacks investigated and identified by the Security
Lab are the latest evidence of a crackdown on freedom of expression in Viet Nam and
against Vietnamese activists outside the country.

Viet Nam’s History of Online Repression
Human rights are increasingly under attack both offline and online in Viet Nam. Over the
past 15 years, repression linked to online activity has intensified, leading to a wave
of harassment, intimidation, physical assault, and prosecution.
Amnesty International has documented multiple cases of the arrest and prosecution
of HRDs in Viet Nam in retaliation for their online expression since 2006. That
year, former prisoner of conscience Truong Quoc Huy was arrested at an internet café in
Ho Chi Minh City. Many activists and bloggers have been convicted for “conducting
propaganda against the state.” Human rights blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (Mother
Mushroom) was sentenced to 10 years in prison in June 2017 on such charges.

Activists and bloggers also face frequent physical assaults by officials or governmentconnected thugs. Police place activists under house arrest or briefly detain them to
prevent them from participating in public events. The government also uses travel bans to
prevent activists and HRDs from going abroad and engaging with the international
community.
In December 2020, Amnesty International published “Let Us Breathe”, a
report documenting the widespread criminalization, online harassment and physical
attacks faced by activists and bloggers and the rising numbers of individuals detained for
peacefully expressing themselves online. Amnesty International also revealed the
increasing complicity of tech giants Facebook and Google in the Vietnamese authorities’
harsh censorship regime, whereby any expression of peaceful dissent is liable to be
blocked or otherwise restricted.
Activists and HRDs are jailed, harassed, attacked, and censored into silence on the basis
of vague and sweeping laws that do not comply with international human rights
standards. In January 2019, a controversial Law on Cybersecurity came into effect in Viet
Nam, granting the government broad powers to limit online freedom, to compel
technology companies to hand over vast amounts of data and to censor users’ content.

What is Ocean Lotus?
The cyber-security industry, comprised of individual and company-based
researchers, routinely researches and publishes information about attack groups targeting
companies and governments. The industry often gives informal names to
groups they continuously track based on each group’s unique tactics and tools. Ocean
Lotus (also commonly called APT32 or APT-C-00) is one of these groups.
The first known Ocean Lotus attack happened in 2014. It targeted US-based NGO
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Associated Press international news
organization and two Vietnamese activists. This group was named Ocean Lotus in a report
from the Chinese company Qihoo 360 in May 2015. In 2017, the American cyber-security
company FireEye published a report linking the 2014 EFF and other attacks to this same
Ocean Lotus.
Over the years, Ocean Lotus has developed a sophisticated spyware toolkit comprised of
several variants of Mac OS spyware, Android spyware and Windows spyware. They also
strategically compromise websites in order to identify visitors and conduct further
targeting. More recently, Ocean Lotus was found creating fake media websites based on
content automatically gathered online.
A significant part of the group’s activities is the targeting of HRDs and civil society. In
2017, the cyber-security company Volexity revealed that over 100 websites were
compromised, including many belonging to human rights organizations from Viet
Nam, in an attack campaign that they attributed to Ocean Lotus. Numerous other spyware

2/7

attacks linked to Ocean Lotus against human rights organizations have also been
reported, such as the targeting of the Cambodian human rights organization,
LICADHO in 2018.
The cyber-security company FireEye describes Ocean Lotus’ operations as “aligned with
Vietnamese state interests” based on the list of targeted companies and civil society
groups they identified. In December 2020, Facebook published a threat report linking
Ocean Lotus’ activities with a Vietnamese company named CyberOne Group. Although
Amnesty International was unable to independently verify any direct connection between
Ocean Lotus and CyberOne or with the Vietnamese authorities, the attacks described
in this investigation confirm a pattern of targeting Vietnamese individuals and
organizations.

Attacks against HRDs
The investigation conducted by Amnesty International’s Security Lab revealed that two
HRDs and a non-profit human rights organization from Viet Nam have been targeted by a
coordinated spyware campaign. This spyware allows to fully monitor a compromised
system, including reading and writing files, or launching other malicious programs.
Bui Thanh Hieu is a blogger and pro-democracy activist who goes by the name “Nguoi
Buon Gio” (The Wind Trader). He writes about social and economic justice and human
rights. He is also critical of the Vietnamese government’s policies and actions regarding
its relations with China, including the dispute over sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Due to his writing and activism, the licence for an Internet Café he owned in Ha Noi has
been revoked and he has been repeatedly subjected to reprisals. He was arrested along
with activists Pham Doan Trang and Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh in 2009 and was kept in
police custody for 10 days for “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests
of the State.” In January 2013, Bui Thanh Hieu reported on the trial of 14 dissidents in
Viet Nam and was arrested and released a few days later. He has since left Viet Nam and
has lived in exile in Germany since 2013.
Vietnamese Overseas Initiative
for Conscience Empowerment
(VOICE) is a non-profit organization
supporting Vietnamese refugees and
promoting human rights in Viet Nam.
It was established in 1997 in the
Filipino capital of Manila as a legal aid
office, before formally registering in
the United States in 2007. The
organization continues to operate out
of Manila and has helped 3,000
Vietnamese refugees resettle in third
countries. Since 2011, VOICE has
operated an internship programme to equip Vietnamese people with knowledge, skills,

3/7

and tools to become effective activists. The organization has faced reprisals from
Vietnamese authorities several times. Staff at VOICE told Amnesty International that
employees and interns have been harassed, banned from travelling, and have had their
passports confiscated when they have returned to Viet Nam. Furthermore, state-owned
media has run an unsubstantiated smear campaign against VOICE, claiming that the
organization is a terrorist group.
A blogger residing in Viet Nam has also
been confirmed as an Ocean Lotus target by the
Security Lab, but due to security concerns their
name has been omitted. They are known to
have spoken out publicly about the Dong Tam
incident on 9 January 2020, when
approximately 3,000 security officers from Ha
Noi raided Dong Tam village and killed the 84year-old village leader Le Dinh Kinh. Three
police officers were also killed. The Dong Tam
incident sparked a national outcry in Viet Nam.
Activists and bloggers were at the forefront of
the public debate online, prompting a nationwide crackdown on online expression by the
government. VOICE and the two bloggers all received emails containing spyware between
February 2018 and November 2020.

These emails pretended to share an important document. They either contained spyware
as an attachment or as a link. Once downloaded and launched on the victim’s computer,
the spyware would then open a decoy document in line with what the email pretended to
share to trick the victim in believing the file was benign.

Screenshot of the email sent to VOICE in April 2020
The spyware identified by the Security Lab were either for Mac OS or Windows systems.
The Windows spyware was a variant of a malware family called Kerrdown and used
exclusively by the Ocean Lotus group. Kerrdown is a downloader that installs additional
spyware from a server on the victim’s system and opens a decoy document. In this case, it
downloaded Cobalt Strike, a commercial spyware toolkit developed by the American
company Strategy Cyber and routinely used to lawfully audit the security of organizations
through simulated attacks. It allows an attacker full access to the compromised system
including executing scripts, taking screenshots or logging keystrokes. Unlicensed versions
of Cobalt Strikes have been increasingly used by attack groups, including Ocean Lotus,
over the past three years.

The Mac OS Spyware was a variant of a malware family for Mac OS developed and used
exclusively by Ocean Lotus, analysed by Trend Micro in April 2018 and November 2020.
It allows the perpetrator to access system information, download, upload or execute files
and execute commands.

Unlawful Surveillance: A Threat to Human Rights
Our investigation was not able to attribute Ocean Lotus’ activities to any company or
government entity. However, the extensive list of people and organizations targeted by
Ocean Lotus over years shows that it has a clear focus on targeting human rights and
media groups from Viet Nam and neighbouring countries. This raises questions about
whether Ocean Lotus is linked to Vietnamese state actors. The consistent evidence linking
Ocean Lotus to Viet Nam should trigger the Vietnamese authorities to undertake an
impartial, thorough and independent investigation into the group's unlawful activities
and human rights abuses.
The targeting of human rights defenders using digital surveillance technology is unlawful
under international human rights law. Unlawful surveillance violates the right to privacy
and impinges on the rights to freedom of expression and opinion, of association and of
peaceful assembly. Both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protect these rights. The Covenant guarantees the
right to hold opinions without interference and the right to free expression (Article 19)
and guards against arbitrary and unlawful intrusion of privacy (Article 17). International
law and standards also require that any interference by the state on the right to privacy
should be lawful, necessary, proportional, and legitimate. States are required to ensure
that individuals whose rights have been violated have access to remedy (Article 2(3)). This
includes the positive obligation to take appropriate measures to prevent, punish,
investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities.
This targeted surveillance led by Ocean Lotus is part of a broader pattern of censorship
and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam, described in depth in Amnesty
International’s “Let Us Breathe” report. Along with the censorship of political content
involving the complicity of “big tech” companies Google and Facebook and the
criminalization of bloggers, it describes the systemic online harassment and abuse of
activists. Against this background, these attacks further undermine the ability of HRDs to
exercise their rights to freedom of expression, opinion and peaceful assembly. Targeting
people solely for peacefully exercising their human rights is unlawful. The Vietnamese
government should conduct an independent and transparent investigation on these
attacks and ensure that effective legal remedies are provided to people who complain of
abuses of their human rights due to surveillance.

Recommendations
To Vietnamese authorities:

5/7

Conduct an independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the unlawful
targeted surveillance of the human rights defenders mentioned in this report,
including investigating the attack group Ocean Lotus and determining whether
there are links between this spyware campaign and any specific government
agencies
Implement a human rights regulatory framework that governs surveillance. Until
such a framework is implemented, a moratorium on the purchase, sale, transfer,
and use of surveillance equipment should be enforced.
Addressing unlawful targeted surveillance also requires changes from the Vietnamese
authorities. You can find a full list of recommendations in the “Let Us Breathe” report
from December 2020.

How to protect yourself
Be careful when receiving emails with attachments or links. If you did not expect to
receive the email or do not know the sender, do not click on the links in the email or
open attached or shared files.
You should pay particularly close attention to shortened links, especially on social
media. Attacks often use these – from Bitly and other shortening services – to trick
you into thinking you are clicking a legitimate link, when in fact you are being
inadvertently directed to a fake site. When in doubt about the shortened link, here is
the guide on how to reveal full URLs
Be careful when a website or application asks for access to your Google account. If it
asks to access your emails (“Read, send, delete and manage your email”), do not
accept unless you have full trust in the application getting access to it.
Enable two-factor authentication (two-step verification) on all your accounts,
especially on your email.
Make sure your operating system and applications are up to date. Avoid using
pirated system software and office tools, as serious damage can be caused to your PC
by malware and spyware included within the copy of the pirated software you
receive.
Use antivirus software. Macs need this just as much as Windows computers. Make
sure Windows Defender (if you are a Windows user), and XProtect (if you are a Mac
user) are turned on.
