Security researchers have concluded that the cybercriminal group sponsored by the
state of North Korea, Lazarus, would be conducting suspicious activities aimed at
companies based in Russia. This is based on the connections discovered between the
tactics, techniques and tools detected and the way of operation of the group also known
as Hidden Cobra.
Services Affected
• Microsoft Windows Operating Systems
Technical details
The Lazarus campaign aimed at Russia uses malicious Ofﬁce documents delivered as
ZIP ﬁles, along with a PDF document called NDA_USA.pdf that contains a StarForce
Technologies agreement, which is a Russian software company that provides copy
protection software.
The security community believes that Lazarus is divided into at least two subdivisions:
the ﬁrst called Andariel, which focuses on attacking the government and organizations of
South Korea, and the second, Bluenoroff, whose main focus is monetization and
campaigning. global espionage.

This incident, however, represents an unusual victim choice by the North Korean threat
actor. In general, these attacks reﬂect geopolitical tensions between the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and nations such as the United States, Japan and
South Korea.
Infection chain
The main infection ﬂow consists of the following three main steps:
1. A ZIP ﬁle containing two documents: a benign decoy PDF document and a malicious
Word document with macros.
2. The malicious macro downloads a VBS script from a Dropbox URL, followed by the
execution of the VBS script.
3. The VBS script downloads a CAB ﬁle from the server in the download area, extracts
the embedded EXE ﬁle (KEYMARBLE) with the Windows "expand.exe" utility, and ﬁnally
executes it.

KEYMARBLE
This malware is a remote administration tool (RAT) that provides its operators with a
basic functionality to retrieve information from the victim's computer. Once executed, it
performs several initializations, contacts a Command and Control server (C & C) and
waits indeﬁnitely to receive new commands. Each received command is processed by
the backdoor and is handled within an appropriate function, which in turn collects an
information or performs an action on the target computer.
