Executive Summary

1/17

Following reports that an attack by the Vice Society ransomware group was
responsible for disrupting a US school district’s operations, SecurityScorecard
researchers reviewed available data from internal sources and strategic partnerships.
SecurityScorecard’s platform revealed that the school district suffered from issues that
our previous research found common among ransomware victims.
SecurityScorecard’s network flow (netflow) analysis suggested that the school district
suffered a series of possible SSH brute force attacks in June and July. Our Attack
Surface Intelligence (ASI) tool identified open ports that may have been vulnerable to
such attacks.
These attacks may represent a novel tactic on Vice Society’s part.

Background
Vice Society Ransomware Group
According to research into the group conducted by Sekoia and published in July 2022, the
Vice Society ransomware group first appeared in May 2021 and has targeted educational
institutions quite heavily; more of its victims have been in the education sector than any
other. Early research into the group suggested that it was a successor to the HelloKitty
ransomware, with one researcher noting similarities between the groups’ encryption methods
as early as June 2021. However, Sekoia’s more recent research suggests that Vice Society
simply uses strains that are relatively easily available through ransomware-as-a-service
operations that have historically been advertised fairly widely in the Russian-speaking
cybercriminal underground, including the HelloKitty and, more recently, Zeppelin strains of
ransomware (Zeppelin was itself the subject of a recent CISA alert). The Zeppelin strain first
became available in Russian cybercrime forums in 2019 and has appeared in more recent
Vice Society attacks. While the group attracted attention early on in its operations for
exploiting the then-novel PrintNightmare vulnerability, the extant public research has not
linked Vice Society to SSH brute force attacks, so the activity described below may
represent a dimension of the group’s attacks not previously reported.
SecurityScorecard Findings
SecurityScorecard’s platform has observed issues (including configurations) affecting the
school district’s assets that are common among ransomware victims according to previous
SecurityScorecard research.
SecurityScorecard found an open FTP service at an IP address attributed to the school
district as recently as August 2. Generally speaking, attackers may take an interest in filesharing services because they offer a means of accessing victim data. Some ransomware
2/17

groups have taken a particular interest in it. For example, Sophos warned in February 2021
that it had observed the Conti group using FTP to steal victim data.
SecurityScorecard also noticed five high-severity vulnerabilities affecting the versions of the
SSH software running at port 22 of four school district IP addresses between July 20 and
August 7. The vulnerabilities in question are CVE-2010-4478, CVE-2016-10009, CVE-20168858, CVE-2016-10012, and CVE-2016-6515. A remote attacker could exploit CVE-20104478 to bypass certain access controls and authenticate to a system, leverage CVE-201610009 to execute arbitrary code on affected systems, and escalate privileges through
exploiting CVE-2016-10012.
Meanwhile, CVE-2016-6515 and CVE-2016-8858 are both vulnerabilities attackers could
exploit to deny service through affected versions of OpenSSH. These vulnerabilities may be
particularly concerning in light of the recent attack not only because Vice Society has, in
general, been known to exploit published vulnerabilities (especially for remote code
execution, which CVE-2016-10009 can allow) and because these vulnerabilities affect
software running at the ports involved in the suspicious traffic uncovered by
SecurityScorecard’s netflow analysis, but also because, more generally, some attacks with
the Zeppelin strain (which Vice Society has employed recently) have exploited vulnerabilities
in public-facing applications for initial access.
SecurityScorecard also observed exposed credentials, which an adversary could use to
launch credential-stuffing attacks; these may have been the particular variety of brute force
attack suggested by the traffic discussed below. SecurityScorecardhas observed 11
information leaks that exposed 239 passwords associated with school district email
addresses, which attackers could have employed in the SSH attacks discussed below. In
some cases, these leaks also contained employees’ personal information, including names,
dates of birth, password hints, job titles, and physical addresses. These latter categories
pose a less direct threat than exposed passwords. Nonetheless, they represent a significant
risk, as attackers could use them to mount social engineering attacks against the employees
in question and then use information acquired from them to attack the school district.
Beyond the possible avenues of attack enabled by the issues discussed above,
SecurityScorecard has previously researched the links between our scorecard factors and
ransomware attacks in order to identify which of the issues we observe are more prevalent
among ransomware victims than other organizations. Many of the issue types identified in
this research also affect the school district in question.
SecurityScorecard observed seventeen cases of exposed personal information affecting
school district employees. This issue was almost 40% more prevalent among the
ransomware cohort than among non-victim organizations. SecurityScorecard observed TLS
services that support weak protocols in use on the district’s networks; this finding is over 30%
more prevalent among ransomware victims than non-victims. Our earlier research also noted
3/17

that another TLS flaw, TLS Service Supports Weak Cipher Suite, was 30% more prevalent in
the ransomware cohort than in the control group. SSC has found services at districtattributed IP addresses to support weak cipher suites. While these findings may not clearly
illustrate the path attackers took to compromise the school district’s systems, they may
indicate that the district suffers from issues common to ransomware victims. In order to better
focus their efforts to collect network flow (netflow) data likely to yield insights about the attack
against the school district, our researchers used its scorecard’s findings to guide their data
collections, limiting their netflow sample to traffic involving the four IP addresses where the
SecurityScorecard’s platform detected the issues discussed above (207.191.197[.]62,
207.191.197[.]42, 207.191.197.41, and 72.52.219[.]120).
Netflow Analysis
SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool detected considerable traffic that may indicate a series of
possible SSH brute force attacks against the school district. SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool
observed 8,281 flows to the four IP addresses attributed to the school district over a
monitoring period lasting from June 5 to August 5, 2022. Of those, a disproportionately large
number (3,571) involved port 22, the standard port for SSH traffic. The dates with the five
heaviest concentrations of traffic using port 22 were (in descending order by flow count) June
5, June 7, June 19, June 10, and July 1. As of August 5, ASI has also revealed that SSH was
still in use at port 22 of the school district IP addresses involved in these flows.
June 5
The first possible attack appears to have occurred on June 5. Three school district-attributed
IP addresses saw a relatively large number of flows (640) that used port 22 and involved the
three aforementioned IP addresses attributed to the school district.
These flows involved 22 external IP addresses, all of which other vendors have linked to
malicious activity:

Another possible attack occurred on June 19, when all four school district IP addresses saw
184 flows using port 22. Those flows involved 19 unique IP addresses, one of which,
41.94.88[.]60, also appeared in the June 5 traffic. Vendors have linked all of the other 18 IP
addresses to SSH brute force attacks, as has ASI’s malicious reputation data (see the
sample of ASI findings below). The IP addresses observed are:

July 1
Another possible attack occurred on July 1, when all four school district IP addresses saw
163 flows using port 22. These flows involved 17 unique IP addresses, one of which,
41.94.88[.]60, appeared in previously-discussed traffic. Other vendors have linked 15 of the
other 16 IP addresses to malicious activity, and ASI has linked the one IP address not
detected by other vendors, 104.208.96[.]100, to SSH brute force attacks.
The 14 IP addresses detected by both the wider community and ASI (see the sample ASI
results below) are:
1. 203.190.55[.]203
2. 188.166.68[.]67
3. 139.59.247[.]236

14/17

Images 15-17: ASI has linked many of the non-school district IP addresses involved in the
traffic observed on July 1 to SSH brute force attacks
While ASI has not linked one IP address, 51.222.12[.]243, to SSH attacks, the wider
community has.
Given that either or both the wider cybersecurity community of VirusTotal contributors and
SecurityScorecard’s ASI tool have linked all of the IP addresses observed communicating
with school district assets over port 22 to SSH attacks, these results suggest this traffic is at
least suspicious. It may represent a series of brute force attacks against the school district
throughout June and July.
Conclusion
This information was gathered and analyzed to briefly preview some of SecurityScorecard’s
Threat Intelligence and investigation capabilities. SecurityScorecard was only able to query
and contextualize some of its in-house sources; it, therefore, bears noting that this is not an
exhaustive list of issues related to the school district’s overall cyber risk exposure. However,
the data researchers have collected and analyzed thus far may offer new insights into the
attack and Vice Society’s operations.
15/17

The timing of these possible attacks in June and July may suggest that Vice Society
attempted credential-stuffing attacks on the school district’s SSH services at an earlier stage
in its operation, prior to the presumed encryption of the district’s systems in early August.
Such attacks could have employed the exposed passwords contained in SecurityScorecard’s
information leak findings or attempted to exploit the high-severity vulnerabilities affecting the
SSH software in use at those IP addresses. Since researchers have not previously linked
Vice Society to SSH brute force attempts, this traffic may represent a novel dimension of
Vice Society’s activity. It is, of course, possible that the suspicious traffic was independent of
Vice Society’s attack on the school district. Still, it is not unheard of for ransomware groups to
use SSH brute force attacks to access victim systems, even if analysts have not previously
observed Vice Society employing such a tactic: 2016 research linked the FairWare
ransomware group to such attacks, and Intezer observed ransomware groups employing it in
2019.
