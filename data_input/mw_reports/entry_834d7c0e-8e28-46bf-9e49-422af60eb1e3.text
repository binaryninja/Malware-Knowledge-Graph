Overview
During the week of July 19th, 2021, information security researchers published a proof of
concept tool named “PetitPotam” that exploits a flaw in Microsoft Windows Active Directory
Certificate Servers with an NTLM relay attack. The flaw allows an attacker to gain
administrative privileges of an Active Directory Certificate Server once on the network with
another exploit or malware infecting a system.
The following details are provided to assist organizations in detecting and threat hunting for
this and other similar types of threats.

Preparation
1/4

The default settings of Windows logging do not often catch advanced threats. Therefore,
Windows Advanced Audit Logging must be optimally configured to detect and to be able to
threat hunt PetitPotam and similar attacks.
Organizations should have a standard procedure to configure the Windows Advanced Audit
Policies as a part of a complete security program and have each Windows system collect
locally significant events. NCC Group recommends using the following resource to configure
Windows Advanced Audit Policies:

Log rotation can be another major issue with Windows default log settings. Both the default
log size should be increased to support detection engineering and threat hunting.
Ideally, organizations should forward event logs to a log management or SIEM solution to
operationalize detection alerts and provide a central console where threat hunting can be
performed. Alternatively, with optimally configured log sizes, teams can run tools such as
PowerShell or LOG-MD to hunt for malicious activity against the local log data.

Detecting and Threat Hunting NTLM Relay Attacks
The PetitPotam attack targets Active Directory servers running certificate services, so this
will be the focus of the detection and hunting. Event log data is needed to detect or hunt for
PetitPotam. The following settings and events can be used to detect this malicious activity:

Malicious Logins
PetitPotam will generate an odd login that can be used to detect and hunt for indications of
execution. To collect Event ID 4624, the Windows Advanced Audit Policy will need to have
the following policy enabled:
Logon/Logoff – Audit Logon = Success and Failure
The following query logic can be used:
Event Log = Security
Event ID = 4624
User = ANONYMOUS LOGON
Authentication Package Name = NTLM*
Elevated Token – *1842

Sample Query
The following query is based on Elastic’s WinLogBeat version 7 agent.

2/4

“event.code”=”4624″ and winlog.event_data.AuthenticationPackageName=”NTLM*”
and winlog.event_data.ElevatedToken=”*1842″ |
PackageName:=winlog.event_data.AuthenticationPackageName |
Token:=winlog.event_data.ElevatedToken |
WS_Name:=winlog.event_data.WorkstationName |
LogonProcess:=winlog.event_data.LogonProcessName |
LogonType:=winlog.event_data.LogonType |
ProcessName:=winlog.event_data.ProcessName |
UserName:=winlog.event_data.SubjectUserName |
Domain:=winlog.event_data.SubjectDomainName |
TargetDomain:=winlog.event_data.TargetDomainName |
TargetUser:=winlog.event_data.TargetUserName |
Task:=winlog.event_data.TargetUserName| table([event.code, @timestamp,
host.name, event.outcome, WS_Name, UserName, Domain, Token, PackageName,
LogonProcess, LogonType, ProcessName, TargetDomain, TargetUser, Task])

Malicious Share Access
PetitPotam will generate odd network share connections that can be used to detect and hunt
for indications of execution. To collect Event ID 5145, the Windows Advanced Audit Policy
will need to have the following policy enabled:
Object Access – Audit Detailed File Share = Success
Object Access – File Share = Success
The following query logic can be used:
Event Log = Security
Event ID = 5145
Object Name = *IPC*
Target Name = (“lsarpc” or “efsrpc” or “lsass” or “samr” or “netlogon”

Sample Query
The following query is based on Elastic’s WinLogBeat version 7 agent.

3/4

“event.code”=”5145” and winlog.event_data.ShareName=*IPC* and (“lsarpc” or
“efsrpc” or “lsass” or “samr” or “netlogon” or “srvsvc”)
| Status:= keywords[0] | Src_IP:= winlog.event_data.IpAddress | PID:=
winlog.process.pid | UserName:=winlog.event_data.SubjectUserName | Domain:=
winlog.event_data.SubjectDomainName | Target_File:=
winlog.event_data.RelativeTargetName | Path:= winlog.event_data.ShareLocalPath |
Share:= winlog.event_data.ShareName | ObjectType:=winlog.event_data.ObjectType
| table([event.code, @timestamp, host.name, Status, Src_IP, PID, UserName, Domain,
task, Path, Share, Target_File, ObjectType])
If you find any false positives, validating them and excluding or refining the query may be
needed. We hope this information can assist your detection and threat hunting efforts to
detect this and similar types of attacks.
