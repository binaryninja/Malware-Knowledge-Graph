The FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA as a part of a series on threats to the 2020 election
to enable the American public to be prepared, patient, and participating voters.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to inform the public that attempts by cyber
actors to compromise election infrastructure could slow but not prevent voting. The FBI and
CISA have not identified any incidents, to date, capable of preventing Americans from
voting or changing vote tallies for the 2020 Elections. Any attempts tracked by FBI and
CISA have remained localized and were blocked, minimal, or easily mitigated.
The FBI and CISA have no reporting to suggest cyber activity has prevented a registered
voter from casting a ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or affected the
accuracy of voter registration information. However, even if actors did achieve such an
impact, the public should be aware that election officials have multiple safeguards and
plans in place—such as provisional ballots to ensure registered voters can cast ballots,
paper backups, and backup pollbooks—to limit the impact and recover from a cyber
incident with minimal disruption to voting. The FBI and CISA continue to assess that
attempts to manipulate votes at scale would be difficult to conduct undetected.

Nevertheless, cyber actors continue attempts against election systems that register voters
or house voter registration information, manage non-voting election processes, or provide
unofficial election night reporting. These attempts could render these systems temporarily
inaccessible to election officials, which could slow, but would not prevent, voting or the
reporting of results.
The FBI and CISA will continue to quickly respond to potential threats, provide
recommendations to harden election infrastructure, notify stakeholders of threats and
intrusion activity, and impose risks and consequences on cyber actors seeking to threaten
US elections.
Recommendations

Seek out information from trustworthy sources.
Always consider the source of voting information. Ask yourself, “Can I trust this
information?”
Seek out election information from trustworthy sources, verify who produced the
content, and consider their intent. Remain alert to these and other schemes which
may impact normal business practices.
For information about registering to vote, polling locations, voting by mail, provisional
ballot process, and final election results, rely on state and local government election
officials.
Verify through multiple, reliable sources any reports about compromises of voter
information or voting systems, and consider searching for other reliable sources
before sharing such information via social media or other avenues.
Report potential crimes—such as cyber targeting of voting systems—to the FBI.
The FBI is responsible for investigating and prosecuting election crimes, malign
foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity targeting election
infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA helps critical infrastructure
owners and operators, including those in the election community, remain resilient against
physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold
the security, integrity, and resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.
Victim Reporting and Additional Information

The FBI and CISA encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or
criminal activity to their local FBI field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) or to the
FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov). For additional assistance, best
