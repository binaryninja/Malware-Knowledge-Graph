Quarterly Report: Incident Response trends from Fall
2020

By David Liebenberg and Caitlin Huey.
For the sixth quarter in a row, Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) observed ransomware
dominating the threat landscape. However, for the first quarter since we began compiling
these reports, no engagements that were closed out involved the ransomware Ryuk (though
there were engagements that were kicked off this quarter involving Ryuk, but have yet to
close). The top ransomware families observed were Maze and Sodinokibi, though barely
more than any others, continuing a trend of “democratization” for ransomware families
observed in last quarter’s report, in which no one family was dominant. With Maze
adversaries’ recent announcement of retirement, the possibility remains that more
ransomware groups will step up to fill the void, accelerating this trend.
Besides the drop in Ryuk, we saw a continuing decline in commodity trojans such as Trickbot
and Emotet, as ransomware adversaries rely more on open-source tools, the Cobalt Strike
framework, and a combination of various living-off-the-land tools and utilities, or “LoLBins."
The lack of Ryuk is somewhat surprising given recent reports from the U.S. government that
indicate adversaries are looking to target health care organizations with Ryuk. Part of this
could be related to the timing of these incidents, which occurred toward the end of Q3 2020.
We do note that there were several Ryuk cases opened toward the end of the quarter which
have yet to close, including one affecting a health care company. CTIR also observed a
general increase in engagements involving attacks against health care organizations toward
1/5

the end of the quarter, though they mostly involved other malware families, such as the Vatet
loader, which is known to target this industry. For more information, you can check out the full
report summary here.

Targeting
Actors targeted a broad range of verticals, including agriculture, food and beverage, health
care, education, energy and utilities, industrial distribution, law enforcement, local
government, manufacturing, and technology. The top targeted vertical was manufacturing, a
continuation of last quarter. However, as mentioned above, there was a spike in attacks
against health care organizations, and some of these engagements have yet to close out. In
counting both engagements that were opened and closed out this quarter, health care and
manufacturing sectors were tied as being the most affected sectors this quarter. Looking
ahead, it appears that adversaries will continue to target the health care industry with
ransomware and other types of attacks given their security postures and incentives to pay,
especially given the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, which threat actors have been
more than willing to capitalize on.

Threats
Ransomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. In a continuation
from last quarter, no one ransomware family was dominant. Furthermore, there were no
engagements that closed out involving Ryuk (though there was one engagement which
opened this quarter in which Ryuk is suspected). In the past, Ryuk was much more
prominent. In a continuation from the last several quarters, the majority of ransomware
attacks were not observed in conjunction with commodity trojan infections, instead relying on
open source tools, Cobalt Strike, and living-off-the-land utilities.
For example, a U.S. manufacturing company was targeted with a phishing email that
contained a malicious ZIP file. Once downloaded and opened, an adversary carried out
multiple malicious actions, including connection to a malicious IP address, account
enumeration, and execution of encoded PowerShell. The adversary attempted to deploy a
malicious ransomware file called “hnt.dll,” which CTIR identified as a Maze ransomware
variant, although the mutexes were slightly different from previous Maze mutexes which
could have indicated a new strain. The customer had Cisco AMP for Endpoints running
which successfully quarantined the malicious DLL. The adversary used several commercially
available and open source tools for malicious means, including PowerShell to execute
encoded commands; Cobalt Strike, including executing "Invoke-DACheck", an Aggressor
script that checks to see if the current user is a domain administrator and "Norton Power
Eraser," a scanning tool that irreversibly removes forensic artifacts vital to the investigation

from systems. CTIR investigated possible indicators of data exfiltration from six hosts to a
malicious C2 IP address, including large amounts of packets exchanged over the observed
time period. However, they found no evidence of data staging or any specific indicators that
data was exfiltrated from the environment.
It is worth highlighting that the Maze ransomware group announced they have officially
closed down their ransomware operation and claimed they will no longer be leaking new
company data on their site. While the validity of Maze’s claim is still unknown at this time, it is
possible that lower-tiered ransomware groups may attempt to compete within this threat
landscape now that a very high-profile group has announced its departure.
CTIR has observed a spike in Vatet loader/ransomware engagements this quarter affecting
health care entities. Vatet is known to be used by adversary groups to specifically target
health care organizations. In one open incident response engagement involving a U.S.
medical center infected with Vatet, CTIR identified the likely infection vector as an IcedID
phishing email with a ZIP attachment that used steganography for loading commands to the
Vatet loader itself. From there, IcedID downloaded and ran Vatet, which started Cobalt Strike
activity and eventually launched and executed the Defray777 ransomware.
Other observed threats this quarter included business email compromise (BEC),
cryptocurrency mining, web shells, brute-force attacks, exploit attempts and information
stealers.

Initial vectors
For the majority of engagements, definitively identifying an initial vector was difficult due to
shortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,
or reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector for the sixth quarter in a
row. Besides email, other initial vectors that CTIR has observed this quarter include drive-by
downloads, RDP brute-force attacks, and exploitation of various vulnerabilities, including
Microsoft Exchange (CVE-2020-0688), SaltStack Salt (CVE-2020-116511 and CVE-202011652), and Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2020-14882).

Top-observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques
Below is a list of the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed in this quarter’s IR
engagements. Given that some techniques can fall under multiple categories, we grouped
them under the most relevant category in which they were leveraged. This represents what
CTIR observed most frequently and is not intended to be exhaustive.

3/5

Key Findings:
The usage of Cobalt Strike decreased by half. However, we do note that there are
many open engagements that rely on Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation.
We observed a robust combination of various living-off-the-land tools and utilities, or
“LoLBins.” This is a continuation of a trend seen in late 2019 where actors combine
fileless malware and legitimate cloud services to improve chances of staying
undetected.
Encoded PowerShell commands account for several execution techniques, illustrating
the need for policies to limit unprivileged users from using PowerShell or CMD
applications.
Leveraging valid accounts is the most observed technique used for lateral movement
this quarter. RDP usage for lateral movement decreased this quarter. However, we did
see brute-force attacks almost double this quarter.
