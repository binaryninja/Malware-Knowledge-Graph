What is a Moose – Introduction
Linux/Moose is a malware family that primarily targets Linux-based consumer routers but
that can also infect other Linux-based embedded systems in its path. The compromised
devices are used to steal unencrypted network traffic and offer proxying services to the
botnet operator. In practice, these capabilities are used to steal HTTP Cookies on popular
social network sites and perform fraudulent actions such as non-legitimate “follows”, “views”
and “likes”.
In May 2015 ESET released a whitepaper on the malware family we named Linux/Moose.
After publication, Linux/Moose’s command and control servers went down and we lost track
of the animal. A few months later, in September 2015, we got a new sample of Linux/Moose
—with, as expected, some evolution after our publication.
For the past year, ESET and the security firm GoSecure combined their skills in order to
research Linux/Moose further. GoSecure investigated the social media fraud aspect and
shed some light on an unknown market they called “The Ego Market”. This market is
highlighted in a new whitepaper published by GoSecure. This blog will cover the technical
changes between the Moose variants we described in our whitepaper and the new variants
that appeared in September 2015.

Moose in the bushes – Hiding the address of C&C
The first thing we noticed when we got the new sample was that there was no more
command and control (C&C) IP address inside the binary. It seems that the operators read
our report carefully and decided to make things a little bit harder for us. In this new version
the C&C IP address is given as an encrypted command line argument, as shown in the
following output:

This new feature implies that we can no longer run the sample by ourselves; our test
machines need to be compromised by an embedded device spreading the threat in-the-wild
in order to retrieve the C&C IP address. The attentive reader will notice that the IP address
shown is in 32-bit integer format.

The purpose of encrypting the IP address here is, if the binary is found alone, useless
without the value passed as argument. Also, the value alone makes no sense without the
binary having the correct value to decrypt the argument. The value is XORed with a static
value as shown in the following code:

Decompiler output

To the best of our knowledge, this value has stayed the same over the last few months.
Here is a Python snippet to decrypt the C&C 32-bit Integer value:

Decrypt C&C IP address

Moose molted – Network communication
The network protocol changed but it kept the basis of its protocol and added new layers.
Here is a quick look of a packet capture from both samples. By the look of things the main
change here is from binary protocol to ASCII printable protocol. In Figure 1, on the left side
there is the old network protocol and on the right side there is the new one.

Figure 1: Network Protocol Differences

In the old sample the configuration was sent by the C&C server to the malware, and
contains various fields like bits field to determine what feature to enable, IP address fields,
whitelist list field and password list field. These fields are still present in the new version, but
separated in three keys (see Table 1). The operator uses the Cookie: and Set-Cookie:
HTTP headers to send these config fields. This config is encrypted by a simple XOR loop
like in the first version but it’s also encoded in order to be printable in the HTTP headers
thanks to the following function:

The PHPSESSID key contains the encrypted value of bit fields that allow to enable or
disable some features on Moose (local/external scan, sniffer, kill process). The LP key
contains the password list. Linux/Moose still tries to spread itself by bruteforcing Telnet
credentials. There was a big change in this list, from around 300 logins and passwords in
2015 versus around 10 in 2016. See below:

The WL key contains the whitelist list. Again the list was shorted from 50 to 10 IP
addresses. These IP addresses are in the IoC section. Linux/Moose still has the ability to
run a proxy service by listening on TCP port 20012. The previous variant used to listen on
port 10073. The proxy feature allows IP addresses from the whitelist to interact with the
malware.

Conclusion
Linux/Moose’s authors have clearly done a lot of work to stay under the radar with the new
version by hiding its C&C server location more effectively and changing the network
protocol. By doing this, Moose avoids the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) released with
ESET’s 2015 whitepaper. Shortening the whitelist and password list shows a more delicate
approach with Moose. Still, some misleading traces are inside the binary like the fake
domain www.challpok.cn found in cleartext in the list of strings or even filenames that can
correspond to bitcoinminer or DDoS malware. Linux/Moose stays exclusively a memoryresident threat; rebooting the embedded device will end its execution.
