Visa Security Alert

DECEMBER 2019

CYBERCRIME GROUPS TARGETING FUEL DISPENSER
MERCHANTS
Distribution: Public

Summary
In summer 2019, Visa Payment Fraud Disruption (PFD) identified three unique attacks targeting merchant
point-of-sale (POS) systems that were likely carried out by sophisticated cybercrime groups. Two of the
attacks targeted the POS systems of North American fuel dispenser merchants. PFD recently reported on
the observed increase of POS attacks against fuel dispenser merchants, and it is likely these merchants
are an increasingly attractive target for cybercrime groups. Track 1 and track 2 payment card data
was at risk in the merchant’s POS environments due to the lack of secure acceptance technology,
(e.g. EMV® Chip, Point-to-Point Encryption, Tokenization, etc.) and non-compliance with PCI DSS.
The activity detailed in this alert highlights continued targeting of POS systems, as well as targeted
interest in compromising fuel dispenser merchants to obtain track data.

1. Threat Description
In the first incident, PFD analyzed the compromise of a North American fuel dispenser merchant. The
threat actors compromised the merchant via a phishing email sent to an employee. The email contained a
malicious link that, when clicked, installed a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on the merchant network and
granted the threat actors network access. The actors then conducted reconnaissance of the corporate
network, and obtained and utilized credentials to move laterally into the POS environment. There was also
a lack of network segmentation between the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) and corporate network,
which enabled lateral movement. Once the POS environment was successfully accessed, a Random Access
Memory (RAM) scraper was deployed on the POS system to harvest payment card data.
The following indicators of compromise (IOCs) are associated with the attack against this North American
fuel dispenser merchant:

In a second incident, PFD identified a different compromise of another North American fuel dispenser
merchant wherein threat actors targeted the merchant’s POS environment. The actors again obtained
network access to the targeted merchant, although it is unclear how the actors gained this initial access,
and moved laterally within the network to the POS environment. A RAM scraper was injected into the POS
environment and was used to harvest payment card data. The targeted merchant accepted both chip
transactions at the in-store terminals and magnetic stripe transactions at fuel pumps, and the malware
injected into the POS environment appears to have targeted the mag stripe/track data specifically.
Therefore, the payment cards used at the non-chip fuel pumps were at risk in the POS environment.
Forensic analysis of the targeted network identified numerous indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can
likely be attributed to the cybercrime group known as FIN8. FIN8 is a financially motivated threat group
active since at least 2016 and often targets the POS environments of retail, restaurant, and hospitality
merchants to harvest payment account data. Among the IOCs recovered are command and control (C2)
domains previously used by FIN8 in threat activity. The malware used in the attack also created a
temporary output file, wmsetup.tmp, which was used to house the scraped payment data. This file was
previously identified in attacks attributed to FIN8 and FIN8-associated malware.
The following IOCs are associated with this attack:
C2s

Troxymuntisex[.]org (162.243.40[.]7)
Nduropasture[.]net (192.64.119[.]98)
Diolucktrens[.]org (157.230.233[.]65)
Fraserdolx[.]org (134.209.78[.]73)

In a third incident, PFD conducted analysis on malware recovered from the network of a compromised
North American hospitality merchant. The analysis determined that the compromise was likely the result
of an operation conducted by the cybercrime group FIN8. The attack used a FIN8-attributed malware, but
also used new malware not previously seen employed by the group in the wild. The new malware is a fullfeatured shellcode backdoor that is based on the RM3 variant of the Ursnif (aka Gozi/Gozi-ISFB) modular
banking malware. While the malware used in this attack was not identified in the attacks against the fuel
dispenser merchants, it is possible FIN8 will use this malware in future operations targeting fuel dispenser
merchants.
The following IOCs are associated with this compromise:

2. Conclusion
PFD reported in February 2019 that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group expanded their operations
to eCommerce merchants. While it is expected that APTs and other financially motivated threat actor(s)
will continue to target eCommerce environments, the recent attacks display a continued interest in
obtaining track data from targeted brick-and-mortar merchants. Additionally, the recent compromises of
fuel dispenser merchants represents a concerning trend whereby sophisticated threat groups have
identified fuel dispenser merchants as an attractive target for obtaining track data.
It is important to note that this attack vector differs significantly from skimming at fuel pumps, as the
targeting of POS systems requires the threat actors to access the merchant’s internal network, and takes
more technical prowess than skimming attacks. Fuel dispenser merchants should take note of this activity
and deploy devices that support chip wherever possible, as this will significantly lower the likelihood of
these attacks. PFD assesses that fuel dispenser merchants will continue to be an attractive target for
sophisticated threat actors motivated by obtaining track data from POS systems.

Recommendations for Issuers and Acquirers
Visa recommends merchants and acquirers take the following actions to mitigate against these threats:
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Employ the IOCs contained in this report to detect, remediate, and prevent attacks using the
POS malware variant.
Secure remote access with strong passwords, ensure only the necessary individuals have
permission for remote access, disable remote access when not in use, and use two-factor
authentication for remote sessions.
Enable EMV technologies for secure in-person payments (chip, contactless, mobile and QR
code).
Provide each Admin user with their own user credentials. User accounts should also only
be provided with the permissions vital to job responsibilities.
Turn on heuristics (behavioral analysis) on anti-malware to search for suspicious behavior,
and update anti-malware applications.
Monitor network traffic for suspicious connections, and log system and network events.
Implement Network Segmentation, where possible, to prevent the spread of malicious
software and limit an attacker’s foothold.
Maintain a patch management program and update all software and hardware firmware to
most current release to limit the attack surface for zero-day vulnerabilities.
In the event of a confirmed or suspected breach, refer to Visa’s What to do if Compromised
(WTDIC), published October 2019.
