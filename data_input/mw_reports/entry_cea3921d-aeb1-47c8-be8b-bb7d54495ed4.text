Dismantling ZLoader: How malicious ads led to disabled security tools and
ransomware

April 13, 2022

As announced today, Microsoft took action against the ZLoader trojan by working with telecommunications providers around
the world to disrupt key ZLoader infrastructure. We used our research into this threat to enrich our protection technologies
and ensure this infrastructure could no longer be leveraged by operators to distribute the trojan or activate deployed
payloads like ransomware. Moreover, we are sharing this intelligence to emphasize the importance of collaboration
throughout the larger security community. Below, we will detail the various aspects for identifying a ZLoader campaign.
Derived from the Zeus banking trojan first discovered in 2007, ZLoader is a malware family notable for its ability to evolve
and change from campaign to campaign, having undergone much development since its inception. ZLoader has remained
relevant as attackers’ tool of choice by including defense evasion capabilities, like disabling security and antivirus tools, and
selling access-as-a-service to other affiliate groups, such as ransomware operators. Its capabilities include capturing
screenshots, collecting cookies, stealing credentials and banking data, performing reconnaissance, launching persistence
mechanisms, misusing legitimate security tools, and providing remote access to attackers.
ZLoader campaign operators evolved the malware from a basic banking trojan to a more sophisticated piece of malware
capable of monetizing compromised devices by selling access to other affiliate groups. By leveraging and misusing
legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, affiliates gain hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices, which can be
further misused for other malicious activities like credential theft or downloading additional payloads, including ransomware.
ZLoader has previously been linked to ransomware infections such as Ryuk, DarkSide, and BlackMatter.
ZLoader attacks have affected nations around the world, with the majority targeting the US, China, western Europe, and
Japan. Due to the modular nature of some of ZLoader’s capabilities and its constant shifts in techniques, different ZLoader
campaigns may look nothing alike. Previous campaigns have been fairly simple, with the malware delivered via malicious
Office macros attached to emails and then used to deploy modules for capabilities. Other, more recent campaigns are
notably complex–injecting malicious code into legitimate processes, disabling antivirus solutions, and ultimately culminating
in ransomware.

Heat map of nations affected by ZLoader attacks
ZLoader operators have also updated their methodology to frequently deliver the malware through targeted malicious
Google Ads. The use of ad fraud is a stealthy way to target end users as it bypasses typical security solutions that can be
found in email and surfaces itself in normal browser activities instead.
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects malicious behaviors related to this campaign. Enabling cloud protection and
automatic sample submission for Microsoft Defender Antivirus aids users and organizations in remaining protected on new
and emerging threats. Moreover, standardizing the use of the Microsoft Edge browser across all corporate devices and
enabling Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protection blocks malicious sites, such as those connected to ZLoader
campaigns.
In this blog post, we characterize the various methods by which a ZLoader campaign might be identified, along with detailing
detection and mitigation information that can help users reduce the impact of this threat.

ZLoader attack chains
ZLoader is a malware variant that has evolved over the years and is used for multiple objectives, meaning that two
campaigns which both use ZLoader may appear completely different. For example, an individual who has experience
responding to a ZLoader campaign that originated from email and dropped the payload via a malicious Office macro, may be
shocked at the complexity of a second ZLoader campaign that uses numerous malicious files for reconnaissance and
antivirus tampering, before finally dropping the actual malware payload.
The following diagram identifies the most common ways the ZLoader trojan has been observed moving through the delivery,
installation, payload, malware activity, and follow-on activity phases of an attack. This diagram is high-level and may not
depict every step or file dropped in some of ZLoader’s more complex campaigns.

Delivery
ZLoader malware has been observed being delivered in multiple ways. Two of the most prominent methods include
malicious search engine ads and malicious emails.
Malicious advertisement delivery
In more recent campaigns, ZLoader has shifted away from using email as a means of delivery and instead used malicious
ads on search engines such as Google to trick users into visiting malicious sites.
Each wave of these campaigns impersonated a specific company or product, such as Java, Zoom, TeamViewer, and
Discord. For the delivery stage of the attack, the actors would purchase Google Ads for key terms associated with those
products, such as “zoom videoconference.” Users who performed Google searches for those terms during a specific time
would be presented with an advertisement that led to the form grabbing malicious domains.
In each instance of this campaign, the actors would compromise legitimate domains that appeared to be owned by
individuals or small businesses, such as personal blogs. They would then set up subdomains on them that were associated
with the product they were impersonating during that time. The product-specific subdomain was the second subdomain on
the domain, while the first subdomain was an extremely long set of words. For example:
zoomdownload[.]linkforbusinessandpersonalusersofourserviceinseptember[.]jumpingonwater[.]com
zoomonline[.]forusersinourservicewithbusinessandpersonalcustomers[.]fineanddandiwithrandi[.]com
zoomdownload[.]onlinestartserviceforyourworkstudymeeting[.]indyflat-tax[.]com
zoomdownloadlink[.]zoomdownload[.]onlinesoftwareforpersonalandbusinessusersinseptember[.]lifeintrainingpodcast[.]com
teamviewerdownload[.]fastserviceworkonlinelinkjoininaugustseptermber[.]greenlinefood[.]net
teamviewerdownload[.]directserviceforonlinepersonalandbusinessusersofourservice[.]wahatalrabeeh[.]co
teamviewerstart[.]linkforpersonalandbusinessusersinourservicestartnow[.]ellisclinic[.]com
In at least one instance of this activity, the compromised webpage was set up to appear as though it was associated with the
company Get VoIP, a legitimate service that provides comparisons between various VoIP providers. The attackers did not
compromise the GetVoIP website or service, rather, they designed the webpage to impersonate the real GetVoIP site.

3/13

Figure 3.

The compromised domain designed to look like the GetVoIP website
From these compromised domains, the users will attempt to download the product being impersonated, which redirects them
to an attacker-owned domain. These domains also pretend to be associated with the legitimate product being impersonated,
and frequently use the .site TLD.
One example of the chain of redirected domains associated with this activity is:
1. https://adservice.google[.]com, redirects to:
2. zoomdownload.linkforbusinessandpersonalusersofourserviceinseptember.jumpingonwater[.]com, redirects to:
3. zoomvideo[.]site
The ZLoader operators have tended to use REG.RU, LLC as the registrar for these final .site domains. Additionally, many of
the domains used within a single campaign have the registrant contact email in common with each other, making it easy to
pivot and find other potentially related domains.
The final website in this chain downloads the initial malicious .msi file.
Email delivery
As with many other malware variants, prior ZLoader campaigns have also been known to use malicious emails to deliver
Office documents containing malicious macros that download the payload. The ZLoader operators do not have a preferred
method of delivering these Office documents and have been observed using both links and attachments in various
campaigns. Some observed means by which a ZLoader email was associated with a malicious document include:
Attached macro-enabled Microsoft Office document
Attached Excel 4.0 document that contained Hidden Sheets and Very Hidden Sheets to host macros
Attached PDF with link to a macro-enabled Office document
Attached ZIP file that contained a macro-enabled Office document or executable
Link to a Google Docs page with links to a macro-enabled Office document
The emails have used a variety of lures, which typically convey a sense of urgency. Some of the campaigns used lures
based on currents events at the time of the campaign, such COVID-19, or generic lures, such as overdue invoice payments
and fake resumes or CVs. Additionally, most of these emails have been sent from consumer email services—
notably AOL.com. There have also been campaigns that used domains that are associated with the lure theme; for example,
some emails were sent from a COVID-themed sender domain.

screenshot of a sample email associated with the ZLoader campaign posing as a request for an overdue invoice.
Regardless of how the operator chooses to deliver the Office document, once the user opens it, they are prompted to enable
macros to view the content. In various known cases, the malicious macros either directly started to download subsequent
payloads or they dropped a VBS file that in turn performed the download.
In general, a connection was made to a compromised WordPress instance hosting the PHP code used by the ZLoader kit.
At this stage, the ZLoader payload was downloaded as a DLL masquerading as an HTML file that is then launched
using rundll32.exe.

Installation
Less complex ZLoader campaigns go straight from the delivery phase to dropping the malicious payload. In more complex
ZLoader campaigns, the next phase of the attack shifts to using a legitimate process such as msiexec.exe to download
several additional files, including many non-malicious .dll files that are legitimate pieces of whatever software is being
impersonated at the time. A malicious .bat file is hidden in those .dll files.
In several instances, these files were added to a folder pretending to be associated with legitimate software, such as Oracle
Java or Brave Browser, using the following pattern as an example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Sun Technology Network\Oracle
Java SE\[malicious file].
The .bat file launches PowerShell to reach out to a download domain to drop the ZLoader payload. Examples of these
domains include:
quickbooks[.]pw
sweepcakesoffers[.]com
Datalystoy[.]com
Teamworks455[.]com
Clouds222[.]com
In some campaigns, the attackers used a script to run various discovery commands prior to downloading the ZLoader
payload, including:
ipconfig /all
net config workstation
net view /all
net view /all /domain

nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts

Payload
Once the ZLoader payload is on the device, it may drop various modules that provide it with additional functionality, such as:
Capturing screenshots
Collecting cookies
Stealing banking passwords
Providing VNC access to attackers
Operators can choose which of these modules to deliver based on how the malware is configured. In most campaigns, the
module files are dropped in subfolders in the AppData folder. Although operators are free to give the subfolders and files
arbitrary names, the names Microsoft researchers have actually observed exhibit two patterns:
Sets of characters that appear random
Concatenated dictionary words
In several campaigns, attackers opted not to use these modules and instead used the payload to download an additional
malicious file. This file was launched and then called back out to the same download domain that the ZLoader payload was
downloaded from, to download a PowerShell script. The downloaded script checked if the device was workgroup- or domainconnected. The PowerShell script then reached out to the command and control (C2) domain and downloaded two malicious
files—typically an .exe and a .dll. The script used regsvr32.exe to launch the DLL and run a command to time out for 200
seconds. After this, cmd.exe was used to launch an additional malicious file, which downloads a VBS file that is loaded by
wscript.

These files were used to tamper with security solutions and to grant attackers hands-on-keyboard access.

Browser credential theft
One of the main functionalities of ZLoader malware is to steal online credentials targeting banks and financial institutions, as
well as other credentials, via client-side web injection and form grabbing attacks. Web injection allows the attacker to alter
content of the websites displayed to the victim, while form grabbing captures credentials from the browser windows. To
accomplish those actions, the malware implements an Adversary-in-the-browser (AiTB) attack.
ZLoader’s main process, msiexec.exe, spawns several threads running at the same time to perform different tasks. Each of
these threads communicate with one another using shared data stored in the global memory, system registry, and encrypted
files. Threads are spawned that execute functions to install a fake certificate and run a local proxy, while another thread is
injected and executed inside the loaded browser process, which is responsible for redirecting traffic via proxy.
A thread runs to traverse the list of running processes and inject codes to target browser processes discovered. ZLoader
targets the following browser processes:
iexplore.exe
firefox.exe
chrome.exe
msedge.exe (Microsoft Edge)
The hook API TranslateMessage is the key malware functionality that performs the form grabbing, keylogging, and
screenshotting of users’ desktops.
For the target browser processes, the following APIs are hooked for tracking, redirecting network activities, and controlling
the certificate verification. The ZwDeviceIoControlFile hooks allow HTTP/HTTPs responses containing web pages codes
from the target to be redirected to the proxy server to be modified. Moreover, any certificate will be tagged as valid.
ntdll.dll – ZwDeviceIoControlFile
crypt32.dll – CertGetCertificateChain, CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy
Another thread is responsible for checking instructions and configurations from the C2 servers every 10 minutes. Included in
the configuration are the list of target banks, financial institutions, and online companies, and the instruction on how to
perform the web injection.
One of ZLoader’s targets is the Microsoft online sign-in page at https://login.microsoftonline[.]com. Several of Microsoft’s
main websites, such as office[.]com, redirect users to this Microsoft online page when they try to sign into their Microsoft
account. When users load their favorite web browser, such as Microsoft Edge, then visit and try to sign into their Microsoft

8/13

account, ZLoader will match the URL to the list of targets. In this case it will match to the first one above and perform the
web injection by inserting malicious JavaScript codes after the string “</head>” and then rendering to the browser
application.

Figure 7. A

screenshot of the fake Microsoft sign-in screen
The codes injected will insert fake web controls and/or additional JavaScript codes that are responsible for capturing the
credentials such as usernames, passwords, and others. This captured information is encrypted and sent to the main bot and
then to the C2 server. With these stolen credentials, the ZLoader operators can potentially gain access to users’ Microsoft
online account to perform further illicit activities. As the malicious activities occurred in the background, even “tech savvy”
users may not be aware that their browser was tampered with, and credentials were stolen.

Defense evasion
ZLoader has used various methods of defense evasion, focused on attempting to appear more legitimate or by disabling
security tools. In multiple campaigns associated with malicious ads, the ZLoader operators would sign malicious files used in
their attack chain. Signing these files is intended to make them appear to be legitimate, non-malicious files used by real
software, rather than malicious files used by malware.
The first method ZLoader has used to sign files is by creating fictitious companies. In certain campaigns, the .msi files that
are installed on the device after the user visits a malicious ad are signed by a fictitious company created by the operator for
the purpose of the campaign. The malware operators created multiple fraudulent companies, such as Flyintellect Inc, and
Datalyst Oy, in several campaigns. Due to the way .msi files are designed, the registry keys that are added by this activity
later in the attack chain are also published by the same company name.
Another method operators have used to evade detection is a set of techniques that utilize validly-signed files to hide
malicious scripts through vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-1599, CVE-2013-3900, and CVE-2012-0151.
ZLoader operators have also attempted to perform defense evasion by disabling security tools. In many instances, ZLoader
will drop a file, frequently a .bat file, that then uses PowerShell to turn off and alter security settings, such as excluding all .dll
and .exe files and regsvr32.exe from being scanned.

Persistence
ZLoader has used various persistence methods across separate campaigns. The first method observed by Microsoft
Security Researchers involves the ZLoader DLL using rundll32.exe to register itself. In other documented cases, it also
creates the following persistence mechanisms for itself or its modules:
Registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Files in the Startup folder
In more recent campaigns, the attackers maliciously used Atera, a legitimate remote monitoring software. While Atera was
not compromised, attackers leveraged its built-in Splashtop Remote Access capabilities to achieve persistence on the
compromised device.

Objectives
After establishing persistence, the campaign operators behind ZLoader infections monetize their access to domain-joined
devices by selling access-as-a-service to other groups, including ransomware affiliates. These groups can then use this
access for their own goals, including installations of Cobalt Strike, which enables hands-on keyboard activities by the actors.
In one instance, the VBS downloaded a batch script which connected to a Cobalt Strike C2 via a DLL beacon dropped on
the device by PowerShell. It was launched via rundll32.exe, with the known Cobalt Strike flag StartW. Reconnaissance
queries were then run on domain-joined devices, performing actions such as searching for all domain trusts on the network.
With the use of Cobalt Strike and Splashtop, attackers have hands-on-keyboard access to affected devices that can be
leveraged for subsequent objectives, including credential theft or deployment of additional payloads such as ransomware.
In the past, ZLoader has been tied to ransomware infections such as Ryuk. We’ve also seen ZLoader operators provide
access to ELBRUS actors who deployed DarkSide ransomware (earlier in 2021). Those that were more recently observed
had been deploying BlackMatter ransomware. Given such history, the Cobalt Strike payloads might indicate pre-ransomware
activities that prefigure a real threat of ransomware attacks.

Defending against ZLoader attacks
The take down effort against ZLoader is just one of the ways in which Microsoft provides real-world protection against
threats. This action will result in protection for a wide range of organizations around the world from malware, affiliates with
hands-on-keyboard access, and additional payloads delivered via ZLoader’s infrastructure.

10/13

Like many modern malware variants, getting ZLoader onto a device is oftentimes just the first step in what ends up being a
larger attack. The trojan further exemplifies the trend of common malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a
pattern also observed in other platforms. ZLoader operators frequently monetize access from infections by selling it to other
affiliate groups, who then use the purchased access to carry out their own malicious objectives. Affiliates may further misuse
legitimate tools like Cobalt Strike or Splashtop to gain full hands-on-keyboard access to target devices, enabling attackers to
perform additional discovery, find high-value targets on the network, move laterally, and drop additional payloads, such as
ransomware variants.
The best advice for preventing ZLoader infections is to simply avoid downloading attachments contained in emails from
unknown senders as well as clicking on sponsored ads and links in search engine results, instead opting for unsponsored
results from verified, trusted sources. Good credential hygiene, network segmentation, and similar best practices increase
the “cost” to attackers, helping disrupt their activities before they reach their target.
Defenders can take the following mitigation steps to defend against this threat:
Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which
identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that contain exploits and host
malware. SmartScreen removes the reputation information for the certificates leveraged during these attacks. Binaries
signed with those certificates will trigger a warning about an “unrecognized app.”
Use Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or other application control technologies to prevent end users
from running unapproved software on their computers.
Run the latest version of your operating systems and applications. Deploy the latest security updates as soon as they
become available.
Use only official, trustworthy websites and direct download links.
ZLoader’s prevalence in the threat landscape demands comprehensive protection capable of detecting and stopping this
malware, its components, and other similar threats at every stage of the attack chain. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
provides next-generation protection that reinforces network security perimeters and incorporates antimalware capabilities to
catch emerging threats, including ZLoader, Cobalt Strike, additional payloads such as ransomware, and subsequent attacker
behaviors. Moreover, our endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities detect ZLoader’s malicious files, behaviors,
domain connections, and other related events before and after execution.
Defenders can further apply the following mitigations to reduce the environmental attack surface and mitigate the impact of
this threat and its payloads:
Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL scanning and rewriting
of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and links in email messages and other
locations. Safe Links scanning occurs in addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware protection in inbound email
messages in Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can help protect your organization from
malicious links that are used in phishing and other attacks.
Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to detonate file attachments via Safe Attachments. Safe Attachments
provides an additional layer of protection for email attachments by verifying a file in a virtual environment prior to
delivering to the inbox.
Check your Office 365 antispam policy and your mail flow rules for allowed senders, domains and IP addresses. Apply
extra caution when using these settings to bypass antispam filters, even if the allowed sender addresses are
associated with trusted organizations—Office 365 will honor these settings and can let potentially harmful messages
pass through. Review system overrides in threat explorer to determine why attack messages have reached recipient
mailboxes.
Configure Exchange Online to enable zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in response to newly acquired threat intelligence.
ZAP retroactively detects and neutralizes malicious phishing, spam, or malware messages that have already been
delivered to mailboxes.
Turn on network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses.
Turn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security services.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These
capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.

11/13

Turn on the following attack surface reduction rules to block or audit activity associated with this threat:
Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion
Block all Office applications from creating child processes
Block Office applications from creating executable content
Block executable content from email client and webmail
Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes
Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
Block process creations originating from PsExec and WMI commands
Use advanced protection against ransomware
Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content
Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts
