Executive summary
Trojan.Taidoor has been consistently used in targeted attacks during the last three years. Since May 2011, there has been a substantial increase in its activity. Taidoor’s current targets are primarily private industry and influential international think tanks
with a direct involvement in US and Taiwanese affairs. Facilities
in the services sector that these organizations may use have also
been targeted. There are a number of additional ancillary targets.
Trojan.Taidoor dates back to March 2008 and in-field telemetry has identified Taidoor being used in targeted attack emails
since May 2009. Fourteen distinct versions and three separate families of the Trojan have been identified to date. The
threat continues to evolve to suit the attackers’ requirements.

Introduction
During 2009, and the majority of 2010, government organizations
and a range of private companies were targeted by the Taidoor attackers. However around the beginning of 2011, the attackers’ focus shifted dramatically, with international think tanks, the manufacturing industry, and defense contractors who have interests in
Taiwan consistently being targeted. The chart below illustrates the
volumes and the industries targeted using Taidoor over the last
three years. The shift in targets is clearly portrayed in figure 1.

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Figure 1

Targeted Taidoor attacks per industry 2009-2011

In 2011 the US had been involved in a variety of discussions with Taiwan, the most public of which was in relation
to the upgrade of the Taiwanese Air Force. Around the same time Taidoor started to almost exclusively target individuals from influential think tanks, specifically those who have expertise in South Asian and South-East Asian
policy and military strategy. Although these are Figure 2
not the first attacks on think tanks, the persisIncrease of Trojan.Taidoor targeted attack emails
tence and sheer volume of the Taidoor attacks
has made them more notable. A timeline of
the attacks highlights the increased volume of
targeted Taidoor emails sent between May and
October 2011, including their peak during the
US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference that
was held September 18-20, 2011, as shown in
figure 2.
While Taidoor’s targets have changed over the
years, the attack methodology has remained
consistent. Currently the only known attack
vector for Taidoor is through targeted emails.
The email attachments exploit a variety of

vulnerabilities, yet the payload Trojan itself has seen little change in terms of functionality. Taidoor is limited to
using publicly disclosed vulnerabilities; no zero-day exploits have been seen in use. This separates Taidoor from
more recent high-profile attacks—such as those involving Duqu or the recent attacks on RSA—where the attacks are highly sophisticated and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. The Taidoor group appears to play a numbers
game when it comes to breaching networks, relying on targeting users running out-of-date, unpatched versions
of software for the attacks. As one particular campaign gathered momentum, the attackers resorted to sending
broad and repeated barrages of emails to large groups of individuals at the target organizations in an attempt to
compromise the network.
The rest of the document will discuss these attacks in more detail, beginning with a breakdown of the typical
stages of a Taidoor attack. Starting with crafting the targeted email, the focus will then move to the attachment
and its components: the Taidoor dropper containing the true payload—an embedded, encrypted back door
Trojan offering remote access to the attacker on the compromised computer. Detailed analysis of the commandand-control (C&C) functionality will be revealed, including the observation of hacked third-party servers as part
of its infrastructure to forward communications to the attackers. During the analysis some live interactive sessions were captured revealing interaction with a human attacker, and his or her intentions once on the box. One
of these interactive sessions is presented. The final section provides attributes that may point to the profile of
the attackers.
Taidoor is not going away. It’s persistent, it’s constantly evolving, and the adaptability of the attackers will ensure that it remains a danger to any organization that falls within its scope.

Technical details
The email
This is the breach component of Taidoor, which is
pivotal to the attack. Taidoor emails are created
with varying degrees of sophistication and are
typically employed in a two-pronged attack.

Figure 3

Mail server country of origin for Taidoor emails

The vast majority of emails used in these recent
attacks are sent from mail servers based in Taiwan and the US, as shown in figure 3. The country of origin will change depending on the targets
of the attack. For example the mails from France
contained subject matter related to the G20 summit in Paris, while those coming from Turkey were
directed at targets with Turkish email addresses.

Crafting the email
To begin with, the main target of interest is
identified. The content of the email is specifically
crafted in order to entice the chosen target into
opening it. The email is then either sent solely to
the target of interest or the target of interest plus
a group of other personnel working at the same
organization. This second strategy is popular with
more recent Taidoor attacks, as it would prove
useful in situations where compromising the main
target is proving difficult. Compromising a lowervalue target still provides a foothold within the
organization from where the attacker can then
attempt to move towards the true target.

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

There are two types of content typically found in Taidoor emails. The first type is simple, requiring little-or-no
background research on the target. The content is general, typically including a catchy Subject line, a funny image, a brief message, or a topical subject that may entice the user into opening the malicious attachment, such
as that displayed in figure 4.
Figure 4

A generic Taidoor email

The second type requires some background research on the intended target. Far more preparation is required,
as the email will need to contain content relevant to the target. The subject line, the message body and the attached document will all contain information that might entice them into reading what is inside the attachment.
The content is typically related to policy or events that the target would be interested in or would likely attend.
The sender’s email address will also be doctored so that it appears to have come from a reputable source; someone they would probably recognize by name. This would likely be a co-worker, a speaker at an upcoming event, or
a prominent individual in their chosen field.

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Here is an example of a targeted attack that took place on October 24, 2011. Over the course of the day, targeted
mails were sent to 25 individuals working at three separate organizations. The same malicious file was attached
to all the emails; however, the subject line and the message content differed. Examining the malicious attachment we could see it was identical for each email. Here are the four subject lines used in these emails, followed
by an example email:
• Fwd: Panetta criticizes North Korea for reckless acts
• Panetta criticizes North for reckless acts
• Returned mail: see transcript for details
• Warning: could not send message for past 4 hours
Figure 5

An targeted Taidoor email

Out of the 25 emails, 22 were sent through a Taiwanese mail server. They targeted individuals working at an
influential international think tank located in the US and were sent in quick succession. Later that day two more
emails containing an identical attachment were sent through a mail server located in the US. However this time
the emails targeted three prominent figures working at three separate organizations: one located in the US (the
think tank that was targeted in the earlier batch of emails) and two others in Germany. These three targets are
subject experts on military strategy and policy in South-East Asia. This tactic is typical of Taidoor, as mentioned
earlier, where one of these targets appears to be the “real” target of interest and the rest appear to be of lesser
interest, but could offer up useful information or be used as a stepping stone toward the true target.
Page 5

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Security Response

Determining who the targets of interest are is
straightforward when examining the frequency
of targeted emails sent to individuals. As an
example, a target of interest at one of these
organizations is referred to as “Mr. X”.

Figure 6

Emails targeting “Mr. X” (2011)

Mr. X was sent up to 23 targeted Taidoor
emails in June 2011 —a substantial increase
from previous months. This individual was
consistently targeted for over nine months—by
far the most targeted individual. Such focus
demonstrates the persistence of the Taidoor
attackers. The repeated attempts indicate that
this target has been extremely difficult to compromise and is considered of high value.

The attachment
The sample email above contained a malicious PDF attachment; however, Taidoor
doesn’t confine itself to PDFs. Taidoor has
been used in a wide variety of attachments,
including malicious Microsoft PowerPoint,
Word (.doc and .rtf file formats), and Excel
files. Malicious executables and even DLLs
(BID 47741) have been used as part of
recent attacks. In these cases the malicious
file is typically contained within an archive.
In more recent attacks Word documents
and PDFs have been the most popular attack vectors. However the malicious attachments constantly change, with new exploits
appearing regularly.

Figure 7

Popularity of attachment type

(.dll, .scr, and .exe files are typically contained within archive files)

The malicious attachments have used a
large set of vulnerabilities over the years,
covering all main document formats. This
clearly indicates that this group has both
the focus and the intent to keep these
exploits relevant and up-to-date. The group
is clearly not afraid to try out new exploits.
The number utilized is remarkable.
• Microsoft PowerPoint Malformed Record Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 18382)
• Microsoft Word Malformed Data Structures Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 21518)
• Adobe Acrobat and Reader Multiple Arbitrary Code Execution and Security Vulnerabilities (BID 27641)
• Microsoft PowerPoint Sound Data (CVE-2009-1129) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 34839)
• Adobe Reader and Acrobat ‘newplayer()’ JavaScript Method Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 37331)
• Microsoft Excel ‘FEATHEADER’ Record Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 36945)
• Adobe Flash Player CVE-2011-0611 ‘SWF’ File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (BID 47314)
• Multiple Microsoft Products DLL Loading Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 47741)
• Adobe Acrobat and Reader CVE-2011-2100 DLL Loading Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 48252)
It is worth noting again that none of the vulnerabilities used by Taidoor are zero-day exploits. Taidoor simply
leverages publicly disclosed security bugs in popular applications and therefore relies on the target or targets to
be running unpatched software.

Figure 8 shows the email attachment
types chosen by attackers in 2011.
We can see a marked increase in the
use of vulnerable Word documents in
the run-up to the US-Taiwan Defense
Industry Conference in September
2011. The group probably found
more success with the Word exploit
for this period of the campaign.
However they switch to older vulnerabilities if the new ones are proving
less successful, which was the case
for BID 47741.

Figure 8

Breakdown of malicious attachment types for 2011
(.dll, .scr, and .exe files are typically contained within archive files)

The goal of the email is to entice the
recipient into opening the malicious
attachment. The goal of the attachment is to surreptitiously copy the
embedded Trojan onto
Figure 9
the user’s computer and
Taidoor PDF attachment
launch it without drawing
attention to the fact that
the user has just been
compromised.
Taking the attachment
in the previous targeted
email, let’s examine what
happens if the malicious
document is opened.
The PDF is exploiting BID
47314, a vulnerability
in Adobe Reader that
leads to code execution
of the attacker’s choosing. This code decrypts,
extracts, and executes
the embedded Taidoor
dropper. It also extracts
and presents the clean
PDF in figure 9, so as not
to alarm the user to any
unusual behavior.
The content in the PDF was scraped from an Associated Press article that started to appear on most major news
feeds the very day the email was sent: October 24, 2011.

The dropper
Once the user has opened the malicious attachment the infection process is set into motion. Once the dropper
is created in the file system, it is executed. It starts one of the following legitimate processes, after which it will
replace this clean, in-memory image with the malicious back door component:
• services.exe
• svchost.exe

Page 7

Security Response

The back door component is normally present in the form of either an encrypted resource entry or as an encrypted binary array within the code section of the dropper. Figure 10 helps illustrate the layout of each file and the
steps taken once the malicious attachment is launched.

The payload
The final payload is now in place. This is the back door component that communicates with the C&C server. The
back door stores configuration information in the “.data” section which is setup by the attackers. This configuration information contains up to three C&C servers, up to three ports per server, and a default sleep interval.
Once the back door is successfully installed on the system it will attempt to communicate with the C&C server
using the HTTP protocol. Let us examine this in more detail.

Command-and-Control server
Protocol
Trojan.Taidoor communicates with the controlling server using the HTTP protocol with requests using the following format and detailed in table 1:
http://[C&C _ SERVER]:[PORT]/[RANDOM].php?id=[RAND][ID][OPTIONAL]
Table 1

HTTP communication format
Variable

Description

[C&C_SERVER]

Up to three configurable C&C servers

[PORT]

Up to three configurable ports

[RANDOM_PATH]

Five random, lower-case letters. Recreated every time Taidoor initializes or fails to contact its configured servers.

[RAND]

Six-decimal, random number recreated for each request. The values are between 0-32767 (limited by RAND_MAX).

[ID]

Twelve characters derived from MAC address of the compromised computer.

[OPTIONAL]

Is "&ext=[FILENAME]", which may be present in requests, related to specific commands.

Page 8

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Security Response

When the message body is present in a request or response, it is encrypted using RC4. The RC4 key is simply a
string representation of the compromised computer’s adapter address (e.g. 01-27-89-AB-CD-EF). This means
that the C&C server must be able to compute the RC4 key from the [ID] present in the HTTP request. Because
such an [ID] is unique for each computer it could also be used by the controlling server for tracking purposes.
Trojan.Taidoor uses an algorithm when generating the ID field. First it obtains a string representation of the
adapter address. A default value of “01-01-01-01-01-01” is used if it fails to obtain the adapter address. It strips
the “-” characters from the string and then increments the value of each character. If it encounters ‘9’ this value
will be set to ‘0’. For example “01-27-89-AB-CD-EF” would convert to “123890BCDEFG”
Trojan.Taidoor periodically queries the C&C server for commands by sending GET requests with an empty message body. This period is configurable by the attacker and is stored, along with the C&C information, in the
data section. Values for this sleep interval has been seen as low as two and as high as 600 seconds. The server
responds with RC4-encrypted commands in the message body. The first byte of decrypted message body is the
command ID, followed by an optional parameter. Table 2 details the commands available to the attacker.

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Security Response

Before the attacker starts an interactive command shell, Taidoor is instructed to reduce the sleep interval to one
second. This improves Trojan.Taidoor’s response time to subsequent commands sent by the attacker. Over the
next 60 seconds the attacker will look for the following information about the compromised host:
• Currently running services.
• Contents of the “Documents and Settings” folder: What users are on the system?
• Contents of the “Recently Used Documents” item.
• Contents of the “Program Files” folder: What software is installed?
• Contents of the Desktop.
• A list of the currently open TCP/IP connections.
• A list of available network connections.
The attacker initially searches for documents and users of interest on the compromised computer. If the user is not a
target of interest, the attacker can search
for other computers of higher value on the
network using the shell or by downloading
additional tools on to the compromised
computer in order to assist in traversing
the network. It is worth noting that this is
not automated, but that an actual attacker
sitting at the other end, typing these commands.

C&C servers by country

Hacked third-party servers
Some basic reconnaissance was done on
the C&C servers used by Trojan.Taidoor.
Many of the Taidoor C&C servers probed
appeared to be compromised third-party
servers, as opposed to leased servers
commonly used as part of a C&C infrastructure. The servers are probably used
in an effort to hide the true location of
the attacker and they simply forward the
malicious communication to another location. The highest concentrations of Trojan.
Taidoor C&C servers are in the US and
Taiwan, as shown in figure 11.

Figure 12

Previously hacked C&C server, as shown in a
publicly accessible website

Simple fingerprinting on these computers
revealed that they were consistently running a number of services. It is probable
that such services were vulnerable to basic
attacks, as several of the C&C servers had
been compromised by third-party hackers
prior to their use by the Taidoor attackers. The screenshot in figure 12 is from a
cached Web page defacement of one particular server. Such defacements are typically performed by attackers with limited
skill sets. This implies that the services on
the computer were trivial to compromise
or that it was poorly maintained, with little
or no patching.

Variants
To date we have seen at least 14 different variants of Trojan.Taidoor. The earliest compilation date is March 11,
2008. Trojan.Taidoor doesn’t track version information itself. However, examining modifications to the compiled
code section of the back door component over time allows for version tracking. Most of the distinct PE images
share identical code sections, and only the details of the C&C servers in the data section differ between attacks.
Some versions have seen extensive use, while others have been seen far less frequently, and for very brief periods of time. Figure 13 tracks the modifications over time.
Figure 13

Taidoor versioning 2008-2011, based on PE code section similarity

This chart shows the date and timestamp of the compiled files with the identified version of the back door.
Version 1 was used on March 11, 2008 and version 13 was used from March 16, 2011 up until August 13, 2011.
There is very little overlap in use of the back doors between versions. This indicates that a single entity is responsible for development. If the source code of the threat was shared amongst multiple entities, there would be
a much larger number of versions,
Figure 14
and their use would overlap more.
Taidoor version distribution in emails (2010-2011)
Several variants were used for an
extended period of time, the most
widely being version 13—the version used to target think tanks.
The chart in figure 14 compares
the date of emails, instead of
compile time, with the back door
version. There is some degree
of overlap, but the majority of
usage is again distinct between
versions. This reinforces the assumption that a single entity is in
control of the source code.

Trojan.Taidoor: Targeting Think Tanks

Patterns of activity
Some interesting patterns of behavior were observed during the interactive sessions with the C&C servers. For
most of the day the servers would issue a connection reset or return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) message. These
servers then “woke up” for certain periods of the day. These times typically occurred between 1:00 and 8:00
UTC. This was the case for the majority of successful C&C interactions logged, indicating some regular pattern of
activity for these attackers.

Attacker profile
Attributing the Taidoor attacks to a particular party is not likely, but there are a number of factors in the Trojan.
Taidoor attacks that may offer an indication as to the source of the threat.
Taidoor has been maintained with new versions and new exploits relatively consistently from 2008, up to the end
of 2011. Such consistency is possible for an individual working full-time. However, the additional work required
to maintain the infrastructure behind Taidoor—hacking C&C servers, investigating targets in order to tailor
attacks, and then actually spreading within a network once it is compromised—is beyond the capabilities of an
individual. A number of people are clearly involved. This is likely an organized group of individuals who have a
broad range of skills and a reasonable level of hacking ability, given the number of compromised C&C servers. It
is quite possible that individuals within the group are given particular roles for each stage of the operation, since
this work would divide up easily.
However, although the group is active and must consist of several people, their resources are limited. No zeroday exploits have been found associated with Taidoor; only previously published ones. The group does not have
the skills to develop a zero-day, nor the funds to obtain them. The C&C servers are hacked, not purchased.
Although hacking of the C&C servers does offer a level of anonymity, it is also an unreliable method of control.
The hacked C&C servers may be discovered by the owner of the comproTable 4
mised computer and shut down at any time. As such, it is unlikely that
Time zones
the group has access to substantial funds.
The times of operation of the attackers may be an indicator as to their
location. As described earlier, interactions with the C&C servers occurred primarily between 1:00 and 8:00 UTC. Table 4 shows these times
for various countries around the world.
In addition, the group can write competent emails in both English and
Traditional Chinese.

was a major shift in the group in 2011, judging from the change in tarUS (Pacific)

gets. Initially starting with a wide range of disparate targets, the group
began to focus almost exclusively on one particular type of target—
policy think tanks—and in relation to one particular topic: US-Taiwanese dealings. The nature of the topic is
something that would be of most interest to parties involved in the discussions, parties who may be affected by
the discussions such as private industry looking for a competitive advantage or nation states, or possibly hackers
looking to expose confidential information on such discussions for ideology or fame.

Conclusion
Trojan.Taidoor’s attack methodology follows a consistent pattern associated with targeted attacks: a crafted
email with a malicious attachment. It’s clear that this group is highly motivated and persistent, which is evident from the longevity of the Taidoor campaign and the variation in targeted organizations. These attacks are
ongoing, so we will continue to provide Symantec customers with cutting-edge solutions to protect themselves
against both current and future Taidoor attacks.
