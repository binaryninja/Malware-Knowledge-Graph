CrowdStrike Threat Intel Team Executive Viewpoint Research & Threat Intel

4/4/22 Editor’s note: The hearing described below has been rescheduled for 10 a.m. EST
on Tuesday, April 5.
On Wednesday, March 30, 2022, Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike Senior Vice President of
Intelligence, will testify in front of CHS (House Committee on Homeland Security) on
Russian cyber threats to critical infrastructure. Within his testimony, Adam will speak
publicly for the first time about a Russia-nexus state-sponsored actor that CrowdStrike
Intelligence tracks as EMBER BEAR.
EMBER BEAR (aka UAC-0056, Lorec53, Lorec Bear, Bleeding Bear, Saint Bear) is an
adversary group that has operated against government and military organizations in eastern
Europe since early 2021, likely to collect intelligence from target networks. EMBER BEAR

appears primarily motivated to weaponize the access and data obtained during their
intrusions to support information operations (IO) aimed at creating public mistrust in
targeted institutions and degrading government ability to counter Russian cyber operations.

Meet the Adversary: EMBER BEAR
CrowdStrike Intelligence attributes destructive activity against Ukrainian networks using the
WhisperGate wiper to EMBER BEAR, assessed at moderate confidence. Additionally,
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with low confidence that data obtained through EMBER
BEAR operations are used to support data leak operations conducted by multiple attribution
fronts.
While other Russia-state nexus adversaries have also been implicated in the dissemination
of stolen data for similar motivations — particularly FANCY BEAR and VOODOO BEAR,
both operated by Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian
Federation (GRU) — EMBER BEAR does not present known links with previously tracked
adversaries. EMBER BEAR is not currently attributed to a specific Russian organization,
although the adversary’s target profile, assessed intent, and their technical tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) are consistent with other GRU cyber operations.
CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Descriptions
High Confidence – Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple
sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a
judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment
still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.
Moderate Confidence – Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and
plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level
of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased
probability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.
Low Confidence – Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain,
the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic
inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for
corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.
