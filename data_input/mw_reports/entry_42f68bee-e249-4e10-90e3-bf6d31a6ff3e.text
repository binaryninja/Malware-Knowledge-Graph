As the conflict in Eastern Europe continues, the Splunk Threat Research Team (STRT) is
constantly monitoring new developments, especially those related to destructive software.
As we have showcased in previous releases in relation to destructive software and
HermeticWiper, malicious actors modify their TTPs in order to become more effective and
achieve their objectives. In the case of HermeticWiper, we witnessed the introduction of
new features since the increment of malicious cyber activity targeting Ukraine from last
month.
We now have a new payload recently discovered by ESET named CaddyWiper, indicating
no code sharing with previous malicious payloads during this campaign. There is one thing
however that has been seen during the deployment of payloads, and that is the use of
Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
Group Policy Objects are Microsoft Active Directory network policies that can be applied
selectively to computers, organizational units, applications, and individual users. Splunk
Security research has previously shown how to use GPOs to defend against Ransomware,
as the selective and massive application of these settings helps streamline, enforce and
harden security policies.
However, as we have witnessed, GPOs can be used to harm if malicious actors can
compromise domain administrators. This new malicious payload, incorporates the following
features:
Domain Controller killswitch. If payload detects installation on a Domain Controller it
stops its functions.
If not in a Domain Controller it destroys users data “C:\Users” and subsequent
mapped drives (this may include network mapped drives).
If not in a Domain Controller it destroys drive partitions including boot partitions
(\\.\PhysicalDrive9 to \\.\PhysicalDrive0)
The above new features indicate the intention of malicious actors to maintain access to
Domain Controllers and deploy destructive software without the need to have to
compromise and get access again if they were destroyed and had to be reinstalled. This
approach is much more tactical and it also gives attackers the possibility to modify, re-apply,
or enforce GPOs that can achieve the deployment of this destructive payload. Below is a
breakdown of these features.

Domain Controller Kill Switch
This wiper will prepare the module name and API name string on the stack to dynamically
parse it upon execution. Then it will execute DsRolePrimaryDomainInformation() API to
retrieve the state data of the targeted host. If the state role of the computer is
DsRole_RolePrimaryDomainController caddywiper will exit its process.

Overwriting Files with Zeroed Buffer
If the computer is not a Domain Controller it will start to do its payload. One of them is
overwriting files in C:\users directory and from Drive D:\ until Drive Z:\.

If it finds a file that is not a folder and has a hidden system attribute, it will adjust the
Security identifier permission of its process as well as its TokenPrivileges to
“SeTokenOwnershipPrivilege” to be able to access those files.

After that checking, Caddywiper will initialize a zeroed buffer based on the file size of the
file it found. If the file size is greater than 0xA00000, It will set the maximum zeroed buffer
size to 0xA00000. That buffer will be used to overwrite the files and make them
unrecoverable.

4/9

Wiping Boot Partitions
This payload will enumerate all possible boot sectors partitions from \\.\PhysicalDrive9 to
\\.\PhysicalDrive0 to overwrite it with a zeroed buffer with size of 1920 bytes. The wiping
was executed using DeviceIoControl IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX.

Impact

This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read
to device disk partition of the host machine. This
technique was seen in several attacks by adversaries
or threat actor to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the boot
sector of each partition as part of their impact payload
for example the “hermeticwiper” malware.

Impact

This analytic is to look for suspicious raw access read
to drive where the master boot record is placed. This
technique was seen in several attacks by adversaries
or threat actors to wipe, encrypt or overwrite the
master boot record code as part of their impact
payload.

Mitigate via GPO
As mentioned in this Threat Update GPOs can also be used defensively and the Splunk
Security Research has previously shown how to apply them in a defensive manner. Here
are some examples of GPO that can be applied to protect against destructive software
attacks:
Force logoff
Remove Computer from Domain
Disable password changes
Disable access to network shares
Enforce account lockout
Prevent further download of payloads from the internet
Apply firewall rules
Prevent reboot of computers

The above GPO settings in combination with Splunk SOAR playbooks such as
Ransomware Investigate and Contain may improve defenses and containment of these
types of attacks.

Mitigation
The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has provided numerous
guidelines on how to prepare, defend and respond against destructive software attacks.
The following links provide extensive information on the subject.
