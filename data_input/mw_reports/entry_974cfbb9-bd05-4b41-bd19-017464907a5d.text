Emotet disruption - Europol counterattack

The prolific Trojan known as Emotet, has been relentless over the past few years,
infiltrating many organizations. However, recent disruption action on the part of
authorities has taken the fight to the criminals behind it.
On 27 January 2021, Europol (the European Union’s Law Enforcement Agency)
announced1 that in collaboration with international law enforcement agencies, they’ve
successfully penetrated the Emotet organized crime group (OCG) and seized control of
command and control (C2) servers operating the botnet. Not only have the authorities,
including the German Federal Police (Bundeskriminalamt), seized several C2 servers,
authorities in the Netherlands (Politie) have indicated they have seized databases used to
store credentials harvested by the malware. Additional agencies in the UK, US, Canada,
Ukraine, Lithuania and France participated in the operation, including carrying out raids in
the Ukraine on the administrators of the infrastructure operating the botnet. Victims can

in the database. This isn’t the first time these authorities have been at the center of
significant cyber-dependant crime-fighting activity, with both the German and Dutch
departments having been instrumental in the takedown3 of the dark web ‘Wall Street Market’.

The coordinated efforts of authorities are bearing fruit as more criminal networks are taken
offline.
This is the second major proactive disruption activity carried out in recent months targeting
sophisticated malware operational capabilities, following efforts in 2020 to takedown the
critical infrastructure operating TrickBot, led by Microsoft and with collaboration from security
partners such as NTT. It should be noted that while it’s highly likely the malware developers
or/and affiliates for Emotet will attempt to stand-up new C2 infrastructure in an effort to
relaunch their campaign, this is an important step in disrupting the day-to-day operations of
the botnet and by dismantling a significant portion of the botnet, reducing gateways for other
malware. Only time will tell if the operators are able to recover from this.
First appearing in 2014, Emotet has been at the center of many security incidents over the
years, starting with a focus on stealing financial information as a banking Trojan and then
evolving into one of the most dominant Trojan droppers of recent times, supporting other
malware families such as TrickBot4 and QakBot5 (Qbot).

Our Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) team have first-hand experience of the
severity of the malware, having carried out multiple incident response engagements involving
Emotet, followed by TrickBot, which then provides access for other threat actors operating
ransomware such as Ryuk. The remediation activities undertaken to contain and mitigate the
threats, is often intense and comprehensive in nature, due to the advanced capabilities of the
malware and the sophisticated techniques utilized to propagate it across an enterprise
network.
In recent months our threat researchers observed a resurgence of Emotet. After a short
absence prior at the end of 2020 there was a significant malspam campaign distributing
spearphishing emails, focused on delivering the newly developed Emotet binaries in
December 2020 and January 2021, with the common portable executable (.exe) binaries,
replaced by a dynamic link library (.dll). The malware is polymorphic in nature and often
difficult to detect and contain, due to the signatures consistently changing for different
payloads. Spearphishing is the primary attack vector, used to entice victims to extract a
password protected archive file (.zip) and access a word document (.doc). Often the email
content contains information previously harvested from email threads, appearing to align to
legitimate organizational communication. Once the word document is accessed, embedded
macros use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to launch a sub-process of
WmiPrvSe.exe, which is hidden obfuscated PowerShell code, aimed at dropping the Emotet
payload onto the host via HTTP (port 80) GET requests.

The malicious code depicted is typically a base-64 encoded string, unicode (UTF16-LE) and
also contains ‘+’ characters used to concatenate the strings. Once fully decoded, the code
contains readable strings, which instructs the operating system to attempt to connection to
the web address delivery URLs, used to drop the Emotet payload into folder directories in
temporary locations, such as %AppData%\Local\ and %AppData%\Roaming\. Once the
payload is created in the file system, it’s executed via rundll32.exe.

Emotet wastes no time in executing functions via legitimate Windows services and
subsequently carries out process injection, in an attempt to avoid detection. The malware
carries out preliminary discovery activities in order to gather intelligence from the infiltrated
host, using legitimate living off the land (LOLbins) tools such as net.exe and ipconfig.exe.
Persistence is established via common methods such as the Windows registry autorun key.
Modules aimed at more intrusive techniques then focus on collecting email contacts and
associated threads, to assist with facilitating further spearphishing campaigns, while
additional processes are spawned, focusing on credential harvesting from web browsers and
brute-forcing local accounts, in an attempt to facilitate lateral movement at a later stage.
Credentials are often exfiltrated via HTTP (port 80) POST requests to C2 infrastructure6
under the control of the threat actor. Emotet aims to penetrate the network further, typically
via cracked credentials and exploiting vulnerable server message block (SMB) protocols
(port 445), while facilitating access to additional threat actors in parallel.
It’s imperative organizations remain cautious, because despite the proactive operations
taking down critical infrastructure, the aforementioned malware distributed by Emotet
remains active and additional threat actors may still remain within your network, utilizing
other C2 infrastructure. Security researchers will now monitor the effect of the takedown
action on the flow of malicious traffic, but nonetheless this is a significant landmark in the
fight against one of the most dangerous malware of recent times.
Organizations should ensure their email security is correctly configured as a first line of
defense and, in addition, employees should be educated on current threats. Furthermore,
security technologies focused on endpoint threat detection must be properly configured and
feedback acted on, if alerts present themselves. Commodity malware should be cleaned up
as a priority, preventing more sinister threats from materializing. To assist with threat hunting
missions, the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) were observed, not only
during the most recent Emotet malspam campaign, but also during recent ongoing incident
response engagements.
