Outlook for the Cybermercenary
Industry

For Raimund Genes (1963 – 2017)

Defending Against Cybermercenary
Attacks

The internet brings new and innovative technologies and services, yet it also serves as the
battleground for malicious actors who seek to attack or steal information from organizations
and individuals. To fulfill the demands of offensive cyberattacks, an industry has emerged
that can sell tools, services and training to governments, corporations, organized crime and
even wealthy individuals. Cybermercenaries are part of this industry, and in return for their
services, they get monetary rewards or other benefits.
The problems that these cybermercenaries cause are getting more profound and are gaining
more attention in recent years. While the services of cybermercenaries may theoretically be
of use in the fight against terrorism and organized crime in well-established jurisdictions
that have democratic control mechanisms and export controls in place, in practice, we see
that the services of these cybermercenaries are being used to attack political opposition,
dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists. 1, 2
Offensive tools are used to spy on these targets — and this can have devastating
consequences. For example, some politicians and journalists who saw no other option
than to flee their home country became the target of aggressive cyberattacks around the
same time they decided to go into exile.3 These attacks might have been the final straw that
forced them to flee the country.
The problem with selling cybermercenary services goes deep, even when they are intended
for use in narrow, ultra-targeted campaigns. Offensive tools and methodologies may become
widely available when advanced malware and knowledge of vulnerabilities are stolen in
hacks and then leaked. For example, in 2015, a well-known hacker-for-hire organization in
Italy became the victim of a hack and its tools were made available to anybody who wanted
to learn how to use them.4
To mitigate the risks to society that these cybermercenaries’ actions cause, there have been
calls to regulate the cybermercenary industry with international agreements and laws.5, 6
These proposals, however, are difficult to implement because countries with different points
of view would have to come to an agreement about what such regulations would look like
and how it gets enforced. Even when worldwide regulations are in place, there will still be
large gray areas where all kinds of actors can offer their services. Moreover, nations might
view cybermercenaries that have headquarters in their own country as a national asset. Not
only can these cybermercenaries be used for attacks that are aligned with the interests of
their home country, but they can also be used as a political tool for foreign policy, just like
conventional weapons.
This research looks into a threat actor group that can be considered a cybermercenary, but
one that prefers to stay in the shadows. To our knowledge, this hacker-for-hire group does
not operate out of a physical building, nor does it have a shiny prospectus that describes its
services. The group does not try to wriggle out of a difficult position by justifying its business,
nor is it involved in lawsuits against anybody attempting to report on their activities. Instead,

this group is quite open about what it does: breaking into email accounts and social media
accounts for money. This threat actor is also involved in selling highly sensitive personal
data like cell tower phone logs, passenger flight records, banking data, and passport details.
The group advertises its services in Russian-speaking underground forums such as Probiv,
where cybercriminals gather to do business with each other. At first glance, it seems that
this hacker-for-hire mostly has customers whose main motive is financial gain. However, we
can also attribute significant political attacks against human rights activists and politicians
in about a dozen countries to this group.
The Russian-speaking threat actor calls itself Rockethack. While we do not know this
group’s whereabouts, we have a good knowledge of its working hours. We suspect that
Rockethack possesses detailed knowledge of how telecommunications and ISPs work in
Russia and neighboring countries.
Rockethack has a massive associated intrusion set with thousands of indicators, which we
are tracking under the name Void Balaur. We chose this name because Balaur is a monstrous
multiheaded legendary creature in Eastern European folklore. It is fittingly symbolic for the
multiple purposes for which Void Balaur is being hired: spying on a local shop in Moscow, on
journalists, human right activists, politicians, scientists, doctors working in a few dozen IVF
clinics, genomics and biotechnology companies, Telco engineers with deep knowledge of
mobile operators’ networks, and business aviation companies. Void Balaur also dabbles in
corporate espionage, is suspected to be selling data to cybercriminals in order to fight their
fellow cybercriminals over disputes, and has conducted attacks against cryptocurrency
users.
We have uncovered more than 3,500 of the group’s targets, some of whom have suffered
long-lasting and repeated attacks. Our research revealed a clear picture: Void Balaur goes
after the most private and personal data of businesses and individuals then sells that data
to whomever wants to pay for it. This business model is perhaps best illustrated by the
mottos the group has been using on the now defunct website, rockethack[.]me. The actor
group used a couple of remarkable mottos in this website. One was:
Деньги не главное в свободном интернете. Главное – власть, которая принадлежит
тому, кто контролирует потоки информации.
This translates to:
Money is not the main thing on the free internet. The main thing is the power that
belongs to the one who controls the flow of information.

The motto is taken from the book “Code of Durov. The Real Story of the Social Network
“VKontakte” and its Creator (2012),” written by the Russian journalist Nikolay Kononov. This
book is about Pavel Durov, the founder of the Russian social networking site Vk.com and
the messenger platform Telegram.
Later, the group used a different motto:
Вся информация мира — это сплетни. Если умеешь их слушать, то можно
научиться и вычленять истину.
Which translates to:
All information in the world is gossip. If you know how to listen to them, then you can
learn and isolate the truth.
This motto comes from another book, “False Mirrors,” by Sergey Lukyanenko. Lukyanenko
is a Russian science fiction author who has voiced political views on Ukraine and Russian
countermeasures against the Magnitsky Act.
Both mottos reflect the nature of Void Balaur’s business: the cybermercenary not only will
steal highly sensitive information from individuals and businesses on demand, but it also
seems to be hungry for data itself. Before a customer asks for a new service, Void Balaur
may already be thinking about how it can get more personal and private data. Throughout
various industries, we saw that Void Balaur targets key employees of corporations who
probably have access to large amounts of personal data.

The Starting Point of Our
Investigation
While many countries around the world were in lockdown during March 2020 to combat the rapidly
increasing Covid-19 infection numbers, we were contacted by a long-time target of Pawn Storm, an
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group also known as APT28.7 This person told us that his wife, who
works as a scientist, had received a dozen phishing emails on her Gmail account.

Figure 1. Gmail phishing emails that the spouse of a long-time Pawn Storm target received in 2020

Figure 2. Credential phishing email stating that the recipient must pay off a debt and
must appear in court

We were immediately alarmed: this would not be the first time Pawn Storm targeted the spouses of their
actual targets.8 However, a closer look at the phishing emails did not show any of the usual indicators
and modus operandi that we have attributed to Pawn Storm during the intensive research we have been
conducting on the group since 2014. The phishing emails, which the spouse received in March 2020, did
not point to Pawn Storm, but they did lead us to another attribution set that we later named Void Balaur.
In this attribution set, we found the domain name rockethack[.]me, which belonged to a hacking service
that advertises in underground forums such as Probiv under the name “Rockethack.” Throughout the rest
of this report, we will refer to this hacking service as Void Balaur.
Void Balaur offers services for hacking into the email mailboxes of several email providers and social
media accounts for money (and possibly other benefits). For some email providers like rambler.ru and
mail.ru, the group offers services at a premium rate where complete copies of mailboxes are stolen
without any user interaction. We have no reason to believe that the latter is not a real business offering.
This means that in some cases, Void Balaur can access mailboxes without the user noticing it. How they
do this will be discussed in a later section.

Table 1 lists some of the indicators that we extracted from the phishing emails that were sent to the spouse
of the long-term Pawn Storm target. We can correlate these indicators in a straightforward manner to the
now-expired domain rockethack[.]me using a couple of steps. We explain this method of pivoting in
Appendix A.
In addition, we can relate the indicators to a collection of IP addresses. A small set of these IP addresses
are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Table 3. A small selection of domains in the large intrusion set of Void Balaur

Table 3 suggests that the targets of Void Balaur are quite diverse. We see hostnames that look like
generic phishing hostnames, a domain name that resembles a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, two
domains that are related to business aviation companies in Russia. and a domain that was mentioned in
a report by eQualitie on notable attacks against human right activists in Uzbekistan.11
The next sections will show that these apparent low-confidence relations are not a coincidence, but
part of Void Balaur’s long-term campaigns. We will show that Void Balaur is not only into hacking email
mailboxes but is also in the business of selling the sensitive private information of its targets. This includes
cell tower log data, passport details, SMS messages, and more. In addition, Void Balaur appears to target
many organizations and individuals that are likely to have access to highly sensitive data on people.

Void Balaur in the Underground
The earliest reference to Void Balaur we could find in underground forums dates back to September 8,
2017. On that day, complaints about spam advertising Void Balaur’s services (under the name Rockethack)
were posted on the underground forum exploit.in. The actual contents of the spam message from 2017
stated that Void Balaur had already been selling its services via resellers in the past, so it is likely that Void
Balaur was in the hacker-for-hire business before 2017. This corresponds with digital traces we were able
to find that pointed to the group’s activities in September 2015 (see Appendix C).
It took another six months before Void Balaur started placing paid advertisements in underground forums
like Darkmoney and Probiv. Probiv, which was established in 2014, acts as an underground marketplace
where malicious actors gather to offer specialized services mostly aimed at providing access to data,
making it an ideal place for Void Balaur to advertise. Darkmoney, meanwhile, is an underground forum
for carders. Void Balaur also advertised their services on Tenec, an underground forum specializing in
monetizing stolen credentials, and Dublikat — yet another underground forum.
The feedback that Void Balaur receives on underground forums is unanimously positive. Posters mention
that the hacking service delivers the requested information on time, while others commented positively
on the quality of the delivered information from mailboxes. Yet others posted about passport details they
had requested.
To our knowledge, Void Balaur has never advertised in underground forums that were not Russian
language-oriented. However, there used to be a website on rockethack[.]me that was registered on
February 21, 2018 and was available on its bare IP address 139.60.163[.]53 until at least December
2020. On the website, Void Balaur listed services such as hacking into mailboxes or flooding them with
spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and flooding phone numbers (in Commonwealth of
Independent States or CIS countries only).

authenticity of this quote.

Figure 4. Offerings from the website of Void Balaur in 2020

The main activities of Void Balaur that were initially advertised on underground forums were breaking into
free webmail, social media, and corporate email accounts. Copies of mailboxes were being offered both
with and without user interaction. Most likely, the option to deliver data with user interaction happens
via credential phishing, and when needed, includes two-factor authentication. For some Russian email
providers, copies of mailboxes are offered without any user interaction. We have no reason to doubt
that this is a real business offering, because we have not seen negative feedback on Void Balaur in
underground forums. We don’t know how customer data like emails are stolen without user interaction,
but there are some scenarios where this would be possible. Note that these are only our conjectures
on how the information is stolen; Void Balaur could have used other methods to gather data from their
targets without user interaction.
•

Key employees of email providers are knowingly selling data — either directly or indirectly — to the
actors behind Void Balaur.

•

Key employees who have legal access to mailboxes have been compromised.

•

Law enforcement personnel who may have legal access to mailboxes are compromised.

•

The computer systems of the email provider have security issues or have been breached.

•

The group uses databases with leaked credentials to access mailboxes without user interaction.

12 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Naturally, the service that retrieves emails without user interaction is offered at a premium rate. We were
unable to establish how they can offer this kind of data.
Starting in 2019, Void Balaur advertised the sale of very private and sensitive data of individuals from
Russia in underground forums. For example:

Table 5. Some of the offerings on sensitive personal data that Void Balaur is advertising in underground
forums. Starting prices are in Russian rubles. We added equivalent US Dollar amounts based on the
exchange rate on September 14, 2021

The telecom data that Void Balaur is peddling includes phone call records with cell tower locations that
could reveal who a person has been calling, the duration of the calls, and the approximate location where
the calls were made. Knowledge of these details could serve several purposes, including committing
serious crimes. Furthermore, blocking phone numbers, a service that Void Balaur also offers, can help
facilitate serious crimes — for example, by ensuring that someone is unreachable by phone while the
crime is taking place.
The price for getting phone call records with or without cell tower information varies a lot between different
Russian providers, up to about a factor of ten. Apparently, getting phone records from some telecom
companies are much easier than from others.
We are not sure how they obtain such sensitive private data — it’s possible that they get it by paying bribes
to insiders in the telecom companies. This scenario was supported by a media article that was published
in 2019 by BBC Russia.12 Other possible scenarios are that key engineers of telecom operators are being
hacked or that the network of telecom companies is being compromised. During our research, we found
supporting evidence for the former: Void Balaur has been targeting key engineers and management of
various mobile telco companies, as shown in Table 6.

Table 6. Noteworthy Void Balaur targets in the telecom industry. For one target, we only have an
approximate target date

In December 2020, reports were released on the investigative journalism website Bellingcat alleging that
there are direct relations between persons working for an intelligence agency and attempted assassinations.
As part of their investigation, Bellingcat journalists bought private flight data from a service that advertises
on Probiv.13 We do not know the exact data sources that these investigative journalists used, but we
do know that Void Balaur offers telecom and passenger flight record data, which was possibly one of
the sources used by the journalists (and we also know that Void Balaur advertises on Probiv, which we
mentioned earlier).
Naturally, the allegations generated a lot of attention in international media. In addition, the news reports
were discussed in underground forums as well. In a posting on an underground forum, Void Balaur
expressed concern about the allegations, as they could be a threat to its business.
One message posted by Void Balaur roughly translates to “Do you think they [Russian LE] will try to discover
the whole chain, or just calm down the noise [generated by the media reports]?” This shows that Void
Balaur was concerned about potential backlash. However, we did not notice any visible consequences.
To our knowledge, Void Balaur did not slow down its services during the time international media showed
a higher interest in underground forums like Probiv.

16 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Void Balaur’s Targets
During our research we were able to collect a significant amount of information on Void Balaur’s campaigns.
We found more than 3,500 email addresses for individuals and companies that the group targeted.
We do not have a list of the users of Void Balaur’s services, but we do know about customers who
commented positively on the group’s services in semi-public underground posts. These customers
were satisfied with the services that Void Balaur provided, such as breaking into email boxes, providing
information on passports, breaking into Telegram accounts, and offering sensitive telco information.
These customers were active participants in underground forums like tenec.cc, Probiv and Darkmoney.
We suspect, however, that the more important customers of Void Balaur are not active participants of
forums like Probiv. We started to realize this when we read a report published in 2019 by the Canadian
nonprofit organization eQualitie.14
The report describes various phishing and web attacks that have been launched against human rights
activists and journalists in Uzbekistan since 2016. It also shows attacks against the websites of media
outlets between 2016 and 2017. The phishing campaigns were done over nearly a year, from March 2018
to February 2019. The report mentions that a threat actor was using professional vulnerability scanning
tools such as Acunetix, NetSparker, and WPScan against three websites that cover political news in
Uzbekistan. EQualitie also reported that it suspects that the same threat actor sent 14 phishing emails to
targets who are either journalists or human right activists in Uzbekistan. In 2020, Amnesty International
published a follow-up report that linked the campaigns that eQualitie originally reported to both Windows
and Android malware.15 Moreover, Amnesty International was able to find an additional 170 targeted
accounts in Uzbekistan and neighboring countries.
Amnesty International and eQualitie clearly indicate that the attacks in Uzbekistan had a serious impact
on the lives of some individuals. This is a telling example of a cybermercenary providing services for a
possibly larger campaign that is causing significant harm to human lives.
While both reports do not attribute the attacks to a particular threat actor, we attribute the attacks with a
medium confidence level to Void Balaur based on the following:
•

An overlap in infrastructure between Void Balaur and the indicators that were posted by eQualitie and
Amnesty International.

17 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

•

The hostnames that were used in known Void Balaur cases we are tracking and the attacks described
by eQualitie have a form that is virtually unique in an enormous database of multibillion records of
passive DNS data spanning 10 years.

•

Some of the Uzbek targets we found to have been targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 are the same as
the targets described in the eQualitie and Amnesty reports.

•

The editor in chief of a media website that was attacked in 2016 and 2017 according to the eQualitie
report was targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 through his private email address.

•

We found one of the email addresses that was mentioned in the eQualitie report as a sender of
credential phishing emails was back on the group’s target list.

Appendix B provides a more detailed explanation on why we think Void Balaur was behind the campaigns
as described in the eQualitie report and the Amnesty International report.
We do not know who paid Void Balaur to target Uzbek-related media and civil rights activists. Apparently,
the client was able to buy Void Balaur’s services even before the group started actively advertising in
underground forums. The campaigns against Uzbek targets started as early as 2016 and were still ongoing
as of 2020, according to our data (and probably even extended to 2021). This shows that Void Balaur is
being hired for long-term campaigns, something we have seen for other targets as well.

Table 7. Uzbek media and human rights activists that Void Balaur targeted in 2020. The indicated
timeframes are conservative; these attacks likely occurred over longer periods.

While Void Balaur advertises in underground forums where criminals gather to do business, its services
are not only used for typical cybercrime but for political reasons as well. This shows that Void Balaur is
knowingly or unknowingly facilitating attacks in which human rights may be violated, a pattern we have
also seen in a couple of other campaigns. A significant part of these campaigns look like the work of an
APT attacker with long-term goals.
Some of Void Balaur’s campaigns are quite brazen. For example, we found that in September 2021,
the group targeted the private email addresses of a former head of an intelligence agency, five active
government ministers (including the minister of defense) and two members of the national parliament of
an Eastern European country.

Aside from political targets in Uzbekistan and Belarus, Void Balaur also targeted politicians and government
officials in the Ukraine, Slovakia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Norway, France, and Italy. Some of these
attacks were part of a larger campaign and not necessarily restricted to attacks over the internet alone.
Some of the victims felt so threatened that they left their home countries and went into exile.

Table 10. Void Balaur very likely targeted four politicians in France, Italy, and Norway for the first time on
the same day in August 2021. Another French former politician was targeted in September 2021. The
targets are from different countries, but they shared similar political views.

19 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Journalists and media organizations are also frequent targets of Void Balaur. We have seen the group
target more than 25 journalists, although we expect the actual number of targeted journalists to be higher.
Some phishing attacks by Void Balaur that, at first glance, look to have a financial motive may actually
be associated with large-scale disruptive attacks. For example, the group launched attacks against a
cryptocurrency exchange for years, targeting not only their customers, but executives as well through
their corporate and personal email addresses. The website of the company has been a regular victim
of DDoS and hacking attacks and one of their employees was even kidnapped for ransom in the past.16
While we do not know whether Void Balaur had anything to do with the kidnapping and the DDoS attacks,
this is again an example where a Void Balaur victim also suffered from larger-scale attacks with real-life
consequences.
Several of the group’s targets are from Russia and other neighboring countries, But the group is also
active in other countries, including the US, Israel, Japan and European countries.

Figure 6. Countries in which Void Balaur email targets were located (companies were targeted via
corporate email addresses; individuals were targeted via private email addresses)

Some of the threat actor’s campaigns span a long period of time. The timeline in Figure 8 illustrates a
long, ongoing campaign against the companies of one of the most successful conglomerates in Russia.
From at least September 2020 to August 2021, Void Balaur has been targeting board members, directors,
executives and family members — all associated with the same commercial conglomerate.

20 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Figure 7. The timeline of a campaign launched against one of the largest conglomerates in Russia.
Several board members, executives, directors and even family members of the billionaire owner were
targeted over a year. This shows that for corporate espionage-related attacks, the campaigns of Void
Balaur can be persistent and long lasting.

21 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Targets with Access to a Large
Amount of Private Information
While investigating the campaigns of Void Balaur, we noticed that the threat actor was targeting
organizations and individuals who potentially have access to a large amount of individuals’ sensitive data.
Some of these targets align with Void Balaur’s offerings in underground forums, while others are new.
We have observed Void Balaur targeting organizations and individuals in the following sectors:
•

Mobile and core telco companies

•

Cellular equipment vendors

•

Radio and satellite communication companies

•

ATM machine vendors

•

Point-of-sale (POS) system vendors

•

Fintech companies and banks

•

Business aviation companies

•

Medical insurance organizations in at least three regions of Russia

•

In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinics in Russia

•

Biotechnology companies that offer genetic testing services

The campaigns are often conducted over an extended period. We do not know exactly why these
organizations and individuals are being targeted. The size and lucrativeness of the industry may play a
role — take for example the IVF market, which has grown into a multibillion industry and could be a reason
for Void Balaur’s interest in IVF clinics (likely for corporate espionage). Besides targeting IVF doctors, Void
Balaur is also taking aim at academic researchers who study human and animal reproduction, which
could also support corporate espionage motives.
However, we also suspect that Void Balaur is hungry for data and information on individuals and could
be looking to expand their current business offerings and explore new methods of providing services to
customers. Offering individuals’ medical data is one example of this. Between May 23, 2020 and April 1,
22 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

2021, Void Balaur targeted more than 50 employees of over 20 Russian IVF clinics. Furthermore, the group
most likely targeted employees of at least four other companies that offer genetic testing services. The
threat actor also showed an interest in compulsory health insurance companies in at least three republics
of Russia. Finally, the group also targeted medical test labs, general physicians, and companies that
sell medical equipment. Doctors and medical service providers possess a sizeable amount of sensitive
information on their patients and there is likely a demand for this kind of data. Offering medical data would
be a natural addition to the services that Void Balaur is advertising today.
We already mentioned that Void Balaur offers sensitive telco data of individuals in some CIS countries,
including text messages and cell tower log files. We also discussed possible ways Void Balaur could
have retrieved this kind of data, such as compromising either a telco company or some of their key
employees. For this, we have supporting evidence (shown in Table 6): the threat actor has targeted key
engineers and managers working for mobile telco operators in Russia and Kazakhstan. The group has
also targeted two manufacturers of cellular equipment as well as companies that specialize in mobile
satellite communications and radio navigation (multiple times for the former).
In May and June 2021, Void Balaur added four Russian vendors of ATM and POS (Point of Sale) vendors
and two Russian virtual cash register service providers to their target list. A couple of Russian fintech
companies that offer innovative products were targeted as well. In our paper on the risks of open banking,
we warned that new fintech startups would be interesting targets for cybercriminals, because they have
plenty of information on the finances of individuals and sales data from shops and malls.17
In Table 5, we mentioned that Void Balaur offers data on purchased plane tickets, except for charters
and private planes. We also observed that the group has been targeting executives of various business
aviation companies. The reason why these executives were targeted could have been to fill the gap of
Void Balaur’s offerings on passenger details of charter flights and private planes.

Cryptocurrency Account Phishing
Void Balaur has been consistently trying to get access to wallets of various cryptocurrency exchange
services. For this activity, Void Balaur narrowly targets people who are interested in cryptocurrencies.
Stealing cryptocurrency is profitable and interesting to cybercriminals as the virtual money that is
associated with cryptocurrency can be transferred to wallets controlled by the criminals, where there is
little chance of recovering the stolen goods.
Since at least 2018, Void Balaur has set up numerous phishing sites related to various cryptocurrency
exchange and cryptocurrency wallet sites. There is one service that stands out, however: EXMO. Some
of Void Balaur’s phishing sites for EXMO user, like exmo[.]ms, were used for about three years, which is
a rather lengthy time. Besides this domain, Void Balaur set up several other domains for EXMO phishing.

Working Times of Void Balaur
We were curious about the working habits of Void Balaur. We collected enough data to gain an idea of
the actor’s working hours. We plotted statistics on hours, weekdays, and months when Void Balaur was
active (Figures 9-13). We did this for both attacks on email addresses of Russian service providers and
attacks on the email addresses of a major international email provider.
It appears that Void Balaur usually starts the working day around 6 a.m. GMT and works until around
7 p.m. We saw hardly any activity from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. GMT. While Void Balaur is less active during
weekends, the actor often works seven days a week and does not take long vacations such as during
Christmas or in the summer. This is in contrast with an actor like Pawn Storm (APT28) who works during
Christmas holidays, but often takes a break in the summer and during a period from the end of December
until around mid-January.

Malware Activities of Void Balaur
Z*Stealer
As first reported in the report by Amnesty International, Void Balaur has used malware against its targets
as well. One file was downloaded from the command-and-control (C&C) server msoffice365[.]win and
had the SHA256 sum 5a2c9060f6cc1e6e0fd09b2b194631d2c7e7f024d9e2d3a9be64570e263f565f. An
analysis of this sample shows that it is a simple information stealer. The malware is highly tuned for
stealing credentials from the following applications and software:
•

Instant messaging software: Pidgin, ICQ/QIP, Miranda, Psi, Jabber accounts

•

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure Shell (SSH) software: FlashFXP, CuteFTP, FileZilla, SmartFTP,
WS_FTP, WinSCP, Total Commander

•

Email clients: Outlook, Yandex, Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, mail.ru, The Bat

•

Virtual Network Computng (VNC) software: RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, UltraVNC

•

Browser software: Opera, Chrome, Chromium, Torch, YandexBrowser, Comodo Dragon, Firefox,
Internet Explorer, Amigo Browser, Sleipnir Browser, Safari

•

Remote Desktop Protocol software

The malware also has cryptocurrency wallet stealing capabilities related to:
•

MultiBit

•

Electrum

•

Terracoin

•

PPCoin

•

PrimeCoin

This kind of malware is perfect for the nature of business in which Void Balaur is involved. It can be used
to steal sensitive data and it has a component for stealing cryptocurrency wallets.

DroidWatcher malware
The Amnesty International report also mentioned that Void Balaur had been using Android malware such
as DroidWatcher, an Android malware that has been around for a long time and is quite easy to find on
the internet.
29 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

We found a sample used by Void Balaur that communicated with one of their C&C servers
at garant-help[.]com. The filename for that sample was “Rasmlar.apk”. It is interesting to
note that “rasmlar” means “photos” in Uzbek language. The sample had the SHA256 sum
902c5f46ac101b6f30032d4c5c86ecec115add3605fb0d66057130b6e11c57e6.
The malware sample had several functions:
•

Transfering incoming/outgoing SMS and phone call logs

•

Phone call recording (exfiltration is done by email)

•

Taking screenshots at specified interval (exfiltration is done by email)

•

GPS position transfer at specified intervals

•

Notification of SIM card changes

•

Automatic silent updates

•

Remote control for phone settings

•

Spying on VK and WhatsApp

The version we found had been tweaked and modified, both for additional functions and to hide its
presence better:
•

Anti-VM and anti-debug features have been added, based on public code.18

•

Addition of XMPP protocol (default XMPP channel admin name set to “opr6”) with Rooster client.19

•

Phone rooting functionalities based on public code “RootTools v3.2.”

•

Remote shell addition

•

Use of Websocket to send information

•

C&C fetching capabilities via a Twitter account

•

Additional spying capabilities for more Android apps:
º

Email : ru.mail

º

Messengers: imo, OK, Telegram, Viber

The malware sample had two predefined C&C servers configured, garant-help[.]com and
192.168.35[.]40:3355 (possibly a leftover from internal testing).
It also had a Twitter account configured, “world181061401,” which has been taken down prior to our
investigation.

30 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Overlap with Pawn Storm
We started our investigation into Void Balaur because we initially suspected that copies of a dozen
phishing emails we had received from a source were the work of Pawn Storm threat actors. We soon
realized that these campaigns belonged to a different group who we later called Void Balaur. However, we
did find a small, but clear overlap between Pawn Storm and Void Balaur during our research.
We have been following Pawn Storm campaigns since 2014, and have collected information on Pawn
Storm targets throughout in all those years. We have seen that thousands of email addresses were
targeted either via spear phishing or credential phishing. This makes it possible for us to compare the
campaigns of Pawn Storm and Void Balaur and their targets.
While there are clear differences between the two threat actors, we can also see some overlap. The
difference is that Void Balaur is a cybermercenary with a wide range of clientele. This makes the Void
Balaur targets a lot more diverse than that of Pawn Storm. Void Balaur is often motivated by crime and
economic espionage while virtually all of the attacks launched by Pawn Storm that we have observed is
motivated by espionage, politics, geopolitics, and the military. We did not observe Void Balaur attacking
military targets except for one minister of defense, but we did see a substantial number of politicians
on their target list. The same holds true for journalists, activists, and religious leaders: Pawn Storm
aggressively targeted one particular group of religious leaders in 2014 to 2016; the same religious leaders
were on Void Balaur’s target list in 2020 and 2021.

Table 12. Comparing credential phishing attacks by Pawn Storm from 2014 to 2016 and Void Balaur
from 2020 to 2021. Since 2020, Pawn Storm has been using brute force attacks on a wider scale.

In total, we have observed a dozen email addresses that were targeted by both Pawn Storm during the
period of 2014 to 2015, and by Void Balaur from 2020 to 2021. Besides the religious leaders, we also saw
attacks on diplomats, politicians and a journalist from both Pawn Storm and Void Balaur.
Generally, there is a clear overlap in the sectors that are being targeted by both groups as we have
illustrated in the table above. However, there are clear differences as well: Based on our observations,
Void Balaur has targeted sectors that Pawn Storm is not active in. For example, Void Balaur has had long
running campaigns against cryptowallet users and even some cryptoexchange platforms. In our research
on Pawn Storm, we never saw any significant targeting of cryptocurrency platforms.

As we reported in 2020, Pawn Storm is still using the classic technique of sending credential phishing
emails to gain access to mailboxes.20 It also does large scale brute force attacks and password spray
attacks via Tor, VPN networks, and occasionally, dedicated IP addresses. We don’t know if Void Balaur is
also trying to use brute force attacks on email account credentials.
32 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Outlook for the Cybermercenary
Industry
The reality is that regular internet users cannot easily deter a determined cybermercenary. More than
once, media outlets have reported on advanced offensive tools in a cybermercenary’s arsenal being used
against journalists and human rights activists. Some of these tools include so-called zero-click zero-day
exploits, which do not require any user interaction to infect the target with malware.21 While these tools
might be meant to be used in the fight against terrorism and organized crime, the reality is that they —
knowingly or unknowingly — end up in the hands of threat actors who use it against unwitting targets.
The core issue that causes these recurring problems is that some countries may view cybermercenaries
within their borders as strategic assets that can be used in multiple ways. First, the services and tools
of cybermercenaries can be used in offensive attacks against terrorism and organized crime, and for
targeting foreign assets. Second, they can also be sold to other countries and used as an economic or
political tool in foreign policy. Though this might benefit some countries, it also poses a tremendous risk
of possible backlash when malicious elements use these tools. Even worse, tools that have been sold
overseas might end up being used against citizens of the country that originally exported these tools.
Citizens can pressure national lawmakers into implementing better regulations for the development and
export of cyberweapons for its national industry of cybermercenaries. This is not an easy task, but it’s
likely one of the few solutions that can better protect the public against cybermercenary attacks at the
government level. Cybermercenaries could also be made accountable for both their actions and the
cyberweapons they export, as was advocated in a Microsoft blog post in 2020.22

33 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Defending Against
Cybermercenary Attacks
Defending against cybermercenaries such as Void Balaur is not an easy task. The group claims it can
retrieve sensitive data on individuals without user interaction and we have no reason to doubt that this
business proposition is a real one under certain circumstances.
Void Balaur sells private data such as emails and cell tower data to anyone who wants to pay for it. This
means that users and organizations should carefully consider the security policies of their email and
mobile providers to determine whether these services are fit for their needs and situation. Users should
also look into alternatives to two-factor authentication via SMS messages since Void Balaur also has
interception of SMS messages in its business offerings. We do not know how Void Balaur is intercepting
SMS messages in Russia, but other threat actors have used tricks like SIM swapping to intercept SMS
messages.23
While the techniques used by Void Balaur might be difficult to defend against, that doesn’t mean that
security best practices are rendered ineffective. In fact, observing simple security practices can go a long
way in helping defend against cybermercenary groups like Void Balaur:
•

Use the email services of a reputable provider that is known to have robust security and have high
privacy standards

•

Use two-factor authentication for email and social media accounts, but instead of using SMS, consider
the use of an app or a device such as Yubikey instead

•

Use apps with end-to-end encryption for communications

•

Use encryption systems like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for communication involving sensitive
information or dialogue

•

Permanently delete old, unneeded messages to prevent sensitive data from ending up in the hands
of third parties in case the machine gets hacked

•

Consider using some of the features of mobile apps that allow for setting a time after which chats for
both the sender and receiver disappear

•

Use drive encryption on all computing devices

•

Turn off laptops and computers when not in use

Table A.4. SSL Certificates for 23.88.228.248

36 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

We think that the IP address 23.88.228.248 has been controlled by the same threat actor for a long
time. Between October 10, 2018 and April 24, 2020, the public SSH key has been recorded multiple
times by both a public SSH scanner as well as a private SSH scanner. It was always the same key with
the fingerprint 55:bd:a1:eb:5f:ac:9e:3f:10:a4:7a:0a:1a:68:0c:a1. This is strong evidence that all of these
domains belonged to the same intrusion set.
In the table showing the DNS resolutions for 23.88.228[.]248, we have listed associated registrant email
addresses. Let’s look at one of them, velikpnov.1992@mail.ru, and do a reverse lookup:

Table A.7. Passive DNS data for IP address 139.60.163.35

Eventually, rockethack[.]me moved to IP address 139.60.163[.]53. On this IP address, the website of
Rockethack was available until the end of 2020, even when rockethack[.]me did not resolve anymore.
This whole chain makes us confident enough to attribute the original phishing emails to Rockethack/Void
Balaur.

these websites moved to the IP address 134.209.86[.]7 later in 2019 (this IP address also hosted googleactivity[.]pw, which we have previously related to Void Balaur in Appendix A). This establishes a direct link
between the Amnesty International report, the eQualitie report and our research on Void Balaur.

42 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities

Besides this, we found that in 2020, Void Balaur targeted the editor-in-chief of one of the websites that
was attacked in 2018 and 2019, according to the eQualitie report.

Appendix C
This appendix shows how we traced the activities of Void Balaur to the year 2015. We started with
some of the indicators that were published originally in the eQuality and Amnesty International report:
my-cabinet[.]com, mail-help-support[.]info, auth-mail[.]me, auth-mail[.]com, and mail-support[.]info. We
can relate these domain names to mx-delivery[.]com by looking at the pattern of hostnames in a large
database of passive DNS data. We found that at least two forms of hostnames are virtually unique in that
database, when we discard one or two for obvious false positives.

Table C.2. Passive DNS data of hostnames starting with see.document

This offers a clear correlation between Void Balaur and the domain name mx-delivery[.]com — though
this is not 100% foolproof. The domain name mx-delivery[.]com was registered on September 16, 2015;
therefore, we think that Void Balaur has been active since at least 2015.
