Background
In 2015 and 2016, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked by not one, but
two Russian intelligence services, the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and the
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The two advanced persistent threat (APT)
groups attributed to these organizations coexisted inside the DNC's networks for months and
provided valuable political intelligence to the Russian government, in the form of stolen files
and emails, during the run-up to US presidential election. This audacious act of cyberespionage brought these two APT groups, also known as FancyBear and CozyBear (coined
by CrowdStrike), into the spotlight and under the microscope ever since.
On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and these two well-known APT groups
(among many others) have been busy launching widespread intelligence gathering intrusion
campaigns to support the Russian government and Russian military. This blog aims to
leverage open source intelligence (OSINT) reports to highlight the recent publicly-known
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by these cyber adversaries in 1H 2022
and the significance of them. For many top enterprises, government organizations, and
political entities, these hacking groups operating on behalf of the Russian GRU and SVR are
priority threats whose capabilities is of the utmost concern.

2022
On 14 January, @billyleonard from the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported
that FancyBear was behind an ongoing credential phishing campaign focused on
Ukraine. The group leveraged *.eu3[.]biz, *.eu3[.]org, and blogspot[.]com hostnames
as part of its phishing infrastructure.
On 7 March, Google TAG disclosed that FancyBear conducted several large credential
phishing campaigns targeting ukr[.]net users (UkrNet is a Ukrainian media company).
This campaign included malicious links to blogspot[.]com sites that redirected
to credential harvesting pages hosted on *.frge[.]io. These phishing links were also
sent from email accounts that had been compromised prior by the APT group.
On 16 March, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) issued
an alert that further highlighted how UAC-0028 (CERT-UA's name for FancyBear) was
phishing UkrNet accounts, but this time the APT group used the tinyurl[.]com URLshortening service embedded inside a QR code the would lead to UkrNet credential
havresting sites with *.frge[.]io and *.m.pipedream[.]net hostnames.
On 7 April, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Digital
Crimes Unit obtained a court order authorizing it to take control of seven internet
domains Strontium (Microsoft's name for FancyBear) used to conduct phishing attacks
against Ukrainian media organizations, as well as government institutions and think
tanks in the US and the EU involved in foreign policy.
On 27 April, Microsoft's Special Report on Ukraine revealed additional details on
Strontium's campaigns:

2/7

In August 2021, Microsoft recorded Strontium targeting defense-related
organizations in Ukraine.
On 4 March, Microsoft specifically noted that the network of the government
of Vinnytsia (a city in west-central Ukraine) was also compromised by Strontium
and that sought access via phishing to other Ukrainian military personnel and
regional Ukrainian government employee accounts.
In April, Microsoft observed Strontium and other suspected Russian nation state
threat actors launch campaigns against or expand on existing access in the
communications sector, targeting the IT infrastructure that supports the sector,
and a major internet service provider (ISP).
On 3 May, Google TAG provided an update on cyber activity in Eastern Europe.
FancyBear was observed targeting users in Ukraine with a new variant of infostealer
malware distributed via email attachments. The new FancyBear malware is a .NET
executable that when ran by the victim steals cookies and saved passwords from
Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. The data is then exfiltrated via email to a
compromised email account.
On 6 May, CERT-UA issued an alert that UAC-0028 sent malicious emails posing as
CERT-UA and contained an attachment in the form of a password-protected RAR
archive "UkrScanner.rar". Inside the RAR file was a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX) of
the same name, which, in turn, contains a malware dubbed CredoMap. Data collected
by the malware was exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to *.m.pipedream[.]net
hostnames.
On 20 June, CERT-UA warned of another UAC-0082 attack, this time pushing
a malicious document called "Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf" via email. If
opened, the document will download an HTML file with embedded JavaScript code
from a *.frge[.]io hostname that exploits CVE-2022-30190, a remote code execution
(RCE) bug in the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) (aka the "Follina"
exploit). If executed successfully by the victim, the exploit chain downloads the
CredoMap malware. The same incident was also analysed by Malwarebytes Threat
Intel (see here) and Team Cymru (see here).

Russian SVR (aka APT29, CozyBear, Nobelium, DarkHalo, TheDukes) activities in 1H
2022
On 27 January, CrowdStrike published a comprehensive report on the 'StellarParticle
Campaign' associated with CozyBear. The report highlighted the novel tactics and
techniques leveraged by the Russian SVR hacking group throughout 2021. This
included details from the SolarWinds supply chain attack, Browser cookie theft, and
Microsoft Service Principal manipulation.
On 18 February, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted a suspected sample of APT29
malware known as EnvyScout. The attackers leveraged the HTML smuggling
technique to deliver an ISO file that, if executed, runs a DLL on the victim's device. This
incident used a COVID-19 theme and reportedly was aimed at the Embassy of the
Republic of Turkey.
On 4 March, the Telsy Threat Intelligence team disclosed several suspected spearphishing attempts against Indian government entities. The phishing attempts were
tentatively attributed to Nobelium/APT29 due to the mutual use of a Cobalt Strike
watermark ("1359593325") and an infection chain that matches reports by Microsoft
and Volexity on Nobelium/APT29 campaigns.
On 18 April, InQuest Labs discovered a malicious file belonging to Nobelium called
"Ambassador_Absense.docx." posing as an official document from the Israeli Embassy
in London. Opening the document downloads a HTML Application (.HTA) file with
embedded JavaScript that decrypts and executes the payload. Once launched, the
malicious payload collects data about the local system and exfiltrates it to a remote
server using api[.]trello[.]com.

4/7

On 27 April, Microsoft's Special Report on Ukraine revealed additional details on
Nobelium's campaigns:
In early 2021, Microsoft observed Nobelium launching a large-scale phishing
campaign against Ukrainian interests involved in rallying international support
against Russian actions
By mid-2021, Nobelium attempted to access IT firms serving government
customers in predominantly NATO member states, at times successfully
compromising then leveraging privileged accounts to breach and steal data from
Western foreign policy organizations.
As 2021 progressed, the Nobelium group, alongside several other suspected
Russian nation state threat actors, sought persistent access to their particular
interests among a total target pool that included Ukrainian defense, defense
industrial base, foreign policy, national and local administration, law enforcement,
and humanitarian organizations.
Also on 27 April, Mandiant released a blog stating that it had gathered sufficient
evidence to assess that the activity previously tracked as UNC2452, the threat group
responsible for the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, is attributable to
APT29.
On 28 April, Mandiant published a report on tracking APT29 phishing
campaigns targeting diplomatic organizations in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It
included the disclosure of two new APT29 malware families uncovered in 2022,
dubbed BEATDROP and BOOMMIC, and details about APT29’s efforts to evade
detection through retooling and abuse of Atlassian's Trello API
service: api[.]trello[.]com.
On 2 May, Mandiant also disclosed a new campaign tracked as UNC3524 that has
reportedly been active since December 2019. UNC3524 campaigns facilitate bulk email
collection from victim environments, especially as it relates to their support of
suspected espionage objectives. Notably, this threat actor leveraged a Dropbear-based
backdoor, dubbed QUIETEXIT, on embedded network devices (such as VPN
appliances) to access MS Office 365 or on-premises MS Exchange emails. Another
interesting tactic is that UNC3524 usually accessed its victim's system from other
compromised devices, usually outdated and unpatched LifeSize conference IoT
cameras. Mandiant analysts tentatively attributed this campaign to APT29. However,
the technical overlaps included TTPs that had already been made public and there
were also some aspects aligned to APT28, which could suggest the two groups share
some tooling.
On 5 May, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted a suspected sample of APT29 malware
that leveraged DLL side-loading as a method of executing their payload by invoking a
legitimate Adobe application to execute their payload.

5/7

On 13 May, Cluster25 published a report analyzing several CozyBear spear-phishing
campaigns involving the above mentioned use of a side-loaded DLL through signed
software (like Adobe suite) alongside the use of the legitimate Dropbox service
api[.]dropbox[.]com as communication vector. The Cluster25 researchers also stated
that this CozyBear campaign potentially impacted at least Greece, Italy, Turkey, and
Portugal especially in the government and foreign affairs sectors.
On 9 June, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted another suspect sample of APT29
malware that also leveraged DLL side-loading as a method of executing their payload
by invoking a legitimate Hewlett Packard application to execute their payload.
On 22 June, Microsoft released another report on 'Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons
from the Cyber War' and included additional details about some of the SVR's
campaigns. The Nobelium group has continued to target Ukrainian and NATO member
states diplomatic entities with password spraying and spear-phishing attacks. Microsoft
also reported that the SVR's influence operations include historical revisionism and the
targeting of think tanks and academics.
