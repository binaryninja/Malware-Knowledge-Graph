The technique of distributing malware under the guise of legitimate software updates is not
new. As a rule, cybercriminals invite potential victims to install a new version of a browser or
Adobe Flash Player. However, we recently discovered a new approach to this well-known
method: visitors to infected sites were informed that some kind of security certificate had
expired. Unsurprisingly, the update on offer was malicious.
We detected the infection on variously themed websites — from a zoo to a store selling auto
parts. The earliest infections found date back to January 16, 2020.

Attack pattern
This is what visitors of any of the hacked websites saw:

The alarming notification consists of an iframe — with contents loaded from the third-party
resource ldfidfa[.]pw — overlaid on top of the original page. The URL bar still displays the
legitimate address. This is what the malicious piece of code inserted into the original HTML
page looks like:

From the screenshot it can be seen that the script parameters depend on the referrer,
user_agent, and cookie values of the user. While the following fixed values are used as the
user_agent_X and timestamp_X strings:

user_agent_X = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.117 Safari/537.36
timestamp_X = 1579118411.0231 (01/15/2020 @ 8:00pm (UTC))
The code inserted by the cybercriminal loads the external malicious script
ldfidfa[.]pw/jquery.js?&up= &ts= &r= &u= &c=

Malicious jquery.js script

The jquery.js script overlays an iframe that is exactly the same size as the page. The iframe
content is loaded from the address https[:]//ldfidfa[.]pw//chrome.html. As a result, instead of
the original page, the user sees a seemingly genuine banner urgently prompting to install a
certificate update.
Clicking the Install (Recommended) button on the banner initiates the download of the file
Certificate_Update_v02.2020.exe, which we detect as Exploit.Win32.ShellCode.gen.
Analysis of the file showed it to be Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Buerak, packed using Nullsoft
Scriptable Install System. It is not the only malware distributed by the attackers. For
example, Backdoor.Win32.Mokes was spread via the same campaign earlier in January.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

9/11

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
