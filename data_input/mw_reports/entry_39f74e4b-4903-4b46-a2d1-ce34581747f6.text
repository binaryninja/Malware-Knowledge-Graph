On April 20, 2021, Mandiant published detailed results of our investigations into
compromised Pulse Secure devices by suspected Chinese espionage operators. This blog
post is intended to provide an update on our findings, give additional recommendations to
network defenders, and discuss potential implications for U.S.-China strategic relations.
Mandiant continues to gather evidence and respond to intrusions involving
compromises of Pulse Secure VPN appliances at organizations across the defense,
government, high tech, transportation, and financial sectors in the U.S. and Europe
(Figure 1).
Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional code families
specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices.
We now assess that espionage activity by UNC2630 and UNC2717 supports key
Chinese government priorities. Many compromised organizations operate in verticals
and industries aligned with Beijing’s strategic objectives outlined in China’s recent 14th
Five Year Plan.
While there is evidence of data theft at many organizations, we have not directly
observed the staging or exfiltration of any data by Chinese espionage actors that could
be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement.
Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that Chinese cyber espionage activity has
demonstrated a higher tolerance for risk and is less constrained by diplomatic
pressures than previously characterized.

Organizations with compromised Pulse Secure devices by vertical and geographic
location

Figure 1: Organizations with compromised Pulse Secure devices by vertical and geographic
location
Pulse Secure continues to work closely with Mandiant, affected customers, government
partners, and other forensic experts to address these issues. Pulse Secure’s parent
company, Ivanti, has released patches to proactively address software vulnerabilities and
issued updated Security Advisories and Knowledge Articles to assist customers. (Please see
the Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines section for additional details.)
UNC2630 and UNC2717 Tradecraft and Response to Disclosure
Mandiant is tracking 16 malware families exclusively designed to infect Pulse Secure VPN
appliances and used by several cyber espionage groups which we believe are affiliated with
the Chinese government. Between April 17 and April 20, 2021, Mandiant incident responders
observed UNC2630 access dozens of compromised devices and remove webshells like
ATRIUM and SLIGHTPULSE.
3/16

Under certain conditions, the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) will show no evidence of
compromise on appliances which may have had historical compromise. This false
negative may be returned because the ICT cannot scan the rollback partition. If a
backdoor or persistence patcher exists on the rollback partition and a Pulse Secure
appliance is rolled back to the prior version, the backdoor(s) will be present on the
appliance. Please see the Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines section
for important information regarding the ICT and upgrade process.
In at least one instance, UNC2630 deleted their webshell(s) but did not remove the
persistence patcher, making it possible to regain access when the device was
upgraded. The remaining persistence patcher causes the malicious code to be
executed later during a system upgrade, re-inserts webshell logic into various files on
the appliance, and recompromises the device.
It is unusual for Chinese espionage actors to remove a large number of backdoors
across several victim environments on or around the time of public disclosure. This
action displays an interesting concern for operational security and a sensitivity to
publicity.
Both UNC2630 and UNC2717 display advanced tradecraft and go to impressive lengths to
avoid detection. The actors modify file timestamps and regularly edit or delete forensic
evidence such as logs, web server core dumps, and files staged for exfiltration. They also
demonstrate a deep understanding of network appliances and advanced knowledge of a
targeted network. This tradecraft can make it difficult for network defenders to establish a
complete list of tools used, credentials stolen, the initial intrusion vector, or the intrusion start
date.
Updates from Incident Response Investigations
We continue to suspect that multiple groups including UNC2630 and UNC2717 are
responsible for this activity, despite the use of similar exploits and tools. There is a high
degree of variation in attacker actions within victim environments, with actors inconsistently
using a combination of tools and command and control IP addresses.
Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional malware families
specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices (Table 1). These utilities have
similar functions to the 12 previously documented malware families: harvesting credentials
and sensitive system data, allowing arbitrary file execution, and removing forensic evidence.
Please see the Technical Annex for detailed analysis of these code families.

Table 1: New malware families identified
Initial Compromise
The actors leveraged several vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN appliances. Mandiant
observed the use of the recently patched vulnerability CVE-2021-22893 to compromise fully
patched Pulse Secure appliances as well as previously disclosed vulnerabilities from 2019
and 2020. In many cases, determining the initial exploitation vector and timeframe was not
possible to determine because the actors altered or deleted forensic evidence, or the
appliance had undergone subsequent code upgrades thereby destroying evidence related to
the initial exploitation.
Establish Foothold
In some cases, Mandiant observed the actors create their own Local Administrator account
outside of established credential management controls on Windows servers of strategic
value. This allowed the actor to maintain access to systems with short-cycle credential
rotation policies and provided a sufficient level of access to operate freely within their target
environment. The actors also maintained their foothold into the targeted environments
exclusively through Pulse Secure webshells and malware without relying on backdoors
deployed on internal Windows or Linux endpoints.
Escalate Privileges
Mandiant observed the actors use three credential harvesting techniques on Windows
systems:
5/16

Targeting of clear text passwords and hashes from memory using the credential
harvesting tool Mimikatz. Instead of being copied locally and executed on the target
system, Mandiant saw evidence of the Mimikatz binary on the source system of an
RDP session (i.e. the threat actor’s system that was connected to the VPN) through an
RDP mapped drive.
Copying and exfiltration of the SAM, SECURITY, and SYSTEM registry hives which
contained cached NTLM hashes for Local and Domain accounts.
Leveraging the Windows Task Manager process to target the Local Security Authority
Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory for NTLM hashes.
In addition to these privilege escalation techniques, the actors specifically targeted separate
privileged accounts belonging to individuals whose unprivileged accounts were previously
compromised (likely through the Pulse Secure credential harvesting malware families). It is
unclear how the account associations were made by the actor.
Internal Reconnaissance
Mandiant found evidence that the actors renamed their own workstations that they
connected to the VPN of victim networks to mimic the naming convention of their target
environment. This practice aligns with the actor’s objective for long-term persistence and
evading detection and demonstrates a familiarity with the internal hostnames in the victim
environment.
The actors operated solely by utilizing Windows-based utilities to carry out tasks. Some of
the utilities observed were net.exe, quser.exe, powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe,
findstr.exe, netstat.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe and tasklist.exe.
Move Laterally
Most lateral movement originated from compromised Pulse Secure VPN appliances to
internal systems within the environment. While connected to the Pulse VPN appliance, the
actor’s system was assigned an IP address from the Pulse VPN DHCP pool and they moved
laterally throughout the environments by leveraging the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), the
Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), and browser-based communication to HTTPS hosted
resources. The actors also accessed other resources such as Microsoft M365 cloud
environments using stolen credentials they had previously acquired.
Mandiant also observed the actors targeting ESXi host servers. The actor enabled SSH on
ESXi hosts that were previously disabled via the web interface. When their operations on the
system were finished, the actors disabled SSH on the ESXi host again and cleared or
preemptively disabled all relevant logging associated with the performed activities. This
includes authentication, command history, and message logging on the system.
Maintain Presence

6/16

Mandiant observed the threat actor maintain persistence by compromising the upgrade
process on the Pulse Secure Appliance. Persistence was primarily achieved by modifying
the legitimate DSUpgrade.pm file to install the ATRIUM webshell across each upgrade
performed by an administrator. The actor likely chose DSUpgade.pm to host their patch
logic as it is a core file in the system upgrade procedure, ensuring the patch is applied during
updates. The patcher modifies content in /tmp/data as this directory holds the extracted
upgrade image the newly upgraded system will boot into. This results in a persistence
mechanism which allows the actor to maintain access to the system across updates.
The actors also achieved persistence in other cases by prepending a bash script to the file
/bin/umount normally used to unmount a Linux filesystem. This binary was targeted by the
actor because it is executed by the Pulse Secure appliance during a system upgrade. The
actor’s script verifies that the umount binary executes with a specific set of arguments, which
are identical to the arguments used by the Pulse Secure appliance to executes the binary.
The inserted malicious bash script remounts the filesystem as read-write and iterates
through a series of bash routines to inject the ATRIUM webshell, hide SLOWPULSE from a
legacy file integrity bash script, remove or add itself from the umount file, and validate the
web process was running after a reboot to return the filesystem back to read-only.
Complete Mission
The threat actor’s objectives appear to be stealing credentials, maintaining long-term
persistent access to victim networks, and accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data. Mandiant
has observed the attackers:
Staging data related to sensitive projects, often in C:\Users\Public
Naming exfiltration archives to resemble Windows Updates (KB) or to match the format
KB<digits>.zip
Using the JAR/ZIP file format for data exfiltration
Deleting exfiltrated archives
Analysis of new malware families is included in the Technical Annex to enable defenders to
quickly assess if their respective appliances have been affected. Relevant MITRE ATT&CK
techniques, Yara rules and hashes are published on Mandiant’s GitHub page.
Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines
To begin an investigation, Pulse Secure users should contact their Customer Support
Representative for assistance completing the following steps:
1. Capture memory and a forensic image of the appliance
2. Run the Pulse Integrity Checker Tool found online
3. Request a decrypted image of each partition and a memory dump
To remediate a compromised Pulse Secure appliance:
7/16

1. Caution must be taken when determining if a Pulse Secure device was compromised at
any previous date. If the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) was not run before the appliance
was updated, the only evidence of compromise will exist in the system rollback partition
which cannot be scanned by the ICT. If an upgrade was performed without first using
the ICT, a manual inspection of the rollback partition is required to determine if the
device was previously compromised.
2. To ensure that no malicious logic is copied to a clean device, users must perform
upgrades from the appliance console rather than the web interface. The console
upgrade process follows a separate code path that will not execute files such as
DSUpgrade.pm.
3. Previous versions of the ICT will exit if run on an unsupported software version. For
every ICT scan, ensure that the ICT would have supported the device's version
number.
4. Reset all passwords in the environment.
5. Upgrade to the most recent software version.
To secure the appliance and assist with future investigations, consider implementing the
following:
1. Enable unauthenticated logging and configure syslog for Events, User & Admin Access
2. Forward all logs to a central log repository
3. Review logs for unusual authentications and evidence of exploitation
4. Regularly run the Integrity Checker Tool
5. Apply patches as soon as they are made available
Geopolitical Context and Implications for U.S.-China Relations
In collaboration with intelligence analysts at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, Mandiant has
identified dozens of organizations across the defense, government, telecommunications,
high tech, education, transportation, and financial sectors in the U.S. and Europe that have
been compromised via vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPNs. Historic Mandiant and BAE
investigations identified a significant number of these organizations as previous APT5
targets.
Notably, compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing’s
strategic objectives as outlined in China’s 14th Five Year Plan. Many manufacturers also
compete with Chinese businesses in the high tech, green energy, and telecommunications
sectors. Despite this, we have not directly observed the staging or exfiltration of any data by
Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement.
Targets of Chinese cyber espionage operations are often selected for their alignment with
national strategic goals, and there is a strong correlation between pillar industries listed in
policy white papers and targets of Chinese cyber espionage activity.

8/16

China has outlined eight key areas of vital economic interest for development and production
which it views as essential to maintaining global competitiveness, under the following
categories: energy, healthcare, railway transportation, telecommunications, national defense
and stability, advanced manufacturing, network power, and sports and culture.
Historical Context
In the Red Line Drawnreport, Mandiant documented a significant decline in the volume of
Chinese cyberespionage activity in 2014 and assessed that the restructuring of China's
military and civilian intelligence agencies significantly impacted Chinese cyber operations.
Then, in September 2015, President Xi of China concluded a bilateral agreement with U.S.
President Obama to prohibit state-sponsored theft of intellectual property for the purpose of
providing commercial advantage. Commercial IP theft has historically been a prominent
characteristic of Chinese cyber espionage activity.
In 2018 we conducted an extensive review of Chinese cyber espionage operations, both
before and after the official announcement of the PLA reforms and bilateral agreement to
determine if there were any corresponding changes in the tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) used during Chinese cyberespionage operations. We observed two
important changes in the type of information stolen and the geographic distribution of the
targets.
Despite examining hundreds of incidents from January 2016 through mid 2019, we did
not find definitive evidence of purely commercial application intellectual property theft in
the US. Recent indictments by the US Department of Justice suggest that this theft did
occur. While we observed other malicious activity, including geopolitical targeting, theft
of intellectual property with military applications, and theft of confidential business
information, we did not find evidence that these cyber operations violated the ObamaXi agreement.
Between January 2016 and mid-2019, the geographic focus of Chinese cyber
operations shifted dramatically to Asia and away from the U.S. and Europe. While the
U.S. remained the single most frequently targeted country, it became a much smaller
percentage of observed activity. From 2012–2015, U.S. targeting constituted nearly 70
percent of all observed Chinese cyber espionage, while from January 2016 through
August 2019, U.S. targeting fell to approximately 20 percent of Chinese activity.
Targeting of Europe represented a similar proportion of overall Chinese activity to
targeting of the Americas.
Changes in Chinese Espionage Activity between 2019 and 2021
Based on developments observed between 2019-2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence
assesses that most Chinese APT actors now concentrate on lower-volume but moresophisticated, stealthier operations collecting strategic intelligence to support Chinese

9/16

strategic political, military, and economic goals. While some of the technical changes may be
the result of the restructuring of China's military and civilian organizations, some changes
possibly reflect larger technical trends in cyber operations overall.
Before the reorganization, it was common to observe multiple Chinese espionage
groups targeting the same organization, often targeting the same types of information.
Post-2015, this duplication of efforts is rare.
Chinese espionage groups developed more efficient and purposeful targeting patterns
by transitioning away from spearphishing and relying on end user software
vulnerabilities and instead began exploiting networking devices and web facing
applications in novel ways. Chinese APT actors also began to leverage supply chain
vulnerabilities and to target third party providers to gain access to primary targets.
Recently observed Chinese cyber espionage activity exhibits an increased diligence in
operational security, familiarity with network defender investigation techniques, and
cognizance of the forensic evidence they leave behind.
We observe the resurgence of older Chinese espionage groups, including APT4 and
APT5 after long periods of dormancy and currently active groups engage in frequent
and widespread campaigns.
Redline Withdrawn?
The Obama-Xi agreement prohibits the theft of intellectual property with purely commercial
applications for the purpose of gaining a competitive advantage. It does not cover
government or diplomatic information, sensitive business communications, IT data, PII, or
intellectual property with military or dual use applications.
We have direct evidence of UNC2630, UNC2717 and other Chinese APT actors
stealing credentials, email communications, and intellectual property with dual
commercial and military applications.
Throughout our investigations, we did not directly observe the staging or exfiltration of
any data by Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the
Obama-Xi agreement.
Given the narrow definition of commercial intellectual property theft and the limited
availability of forensic evidence, it is possible that our assessment will change with the
discovery of new information.
Evidence collected by Mandiant over the past decade suggests that norms and diplomatic
agreements do not significantly limit China's use of its cyber threat capabilities, particularly
when serving high-priority missions.
The greater ambition and risk tolerance demonstrated by Chinese policymakers since 2019
indicates that the tempo of Chinese state-sponsored activity may increase in the near future
and that the Chinese cyber threat apparatus presents a renewed and serious threat to US

10/16

and European commercial entities.

BLOODMINE
BLOODMINE is a utility for parsing Pulse Secure Connect log files. It extracts information
related to logins, Message IDs and Web Requests and copies the relevant data to another
file.
The sample takes three command line arguments
1. Filename to read
2. Filename to write
3. Timeout interval
It parses the input file for login status codes:
AUT31504
AUT24414
AUT22673

BLOODBANK
BLOODBANK is a credential theft utility that parses two LMDB (an in memory database) files
and expects an output file to be given at the command prompt. BLOODBANK takes
advantage of a legitimate process that supports Single Sign On functionality and looks for
plaintext passwords when they are briefly loaded in memory.
The utility parses the following two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords:
/home/runtime/mtmp/lmdb/data0/data.mdb
/home/runtime/mtmp/system
BLOODBANK expects an output file as a command line parameter, otherwise it prints file
open error. It contains the following strings which it likely tries to extract and target.

CLEANPULSE
14/16

CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events
from occurring. The utility inserts two strings from the command line into the target process
and patches code to conditionally circumvent a function call in the original executable.
File Name

File Type

Size

dsrlog

ELF.X86

13332

Compile Time

The utility expects to be run from the command line as follows:
drslog <pid> <code2_string> <code3_string> <command>
Where <pid> is the pid process ID to patch in memory, <code2_string> and <code3_string>
are two strings to write into the target process, and <command> is either 'e' or 'E' for
installation or 'u' or 'U' for uninstallation.
During installation (using the 'e' or 'E' <command>), the <code2_string> <code3_string>
command line strings are written to the target process at hard-coded memory addresses, a
small amount of code is written, and a jump instruction to the code snippet is patched in
memory of the target process. The added code checks whether an argument is equal to
either <code2_string> <code3_string> strings, and if, so skips a function call in the target
process.
During uninstall (using the 'u' or 'U' <command>) the patch jump location is overwritten with
what appears to be the original 8 bytes of instructions, and the two additional memory buffers
and the code snippet appear to be overwritten with zeros.
The CLEANPULSE utility is highly specific to a victim environment. It does not contain any
validation code when patching (i.e. verifying that code is expected prior to modifying it), and it
contains hard-coded addresses to patch.
The target code to patch appears to be the byte sequence: 89 4C 24 08 FF 52 04. This
appears as the last bytes in the patched code, and is the 8-bytes written when the uninstall
'u' command is given.
These bytes correspond to the following two instructions:
.data:0804B138 89 4C 24 08

mov

[esp+8], ecx

.data:0804B13C FF 52 04

call

dword ptr [edx+4]

15/16

This byte sequence occurs at the hard-coded patch address the utility expects, dslogserver.
Based on status and error messages in nearby functions the executable dslogserver appears
to be related to log event handling, and the purpose of the CLEANPULSE utility may be to
prevent certain events from being logged.
There are several un-referenced functions that appear to have been taken from the open
source project PUPYRAT. It is likely that the actor re-purposed this open source code, using
PUPYRAT as a simple template project.
RAPIDPULSE
RAPIDPULSE is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read. As is common with other
webshells, RAPIDPULSE exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file.
The webshell modifies the legitimate file's main routine which compares the HTTP query
parameter with key name: deviceid to a specific key with value. If the parameter matches,
then the sample uses an RC4 key to decrypt HTTP query parameter with key name:
hmacTime. This decrypted value is a filename which the sample then opens, reads, RC4
encrypts with the same key, base64 encodes, then writes to stdout. The appliance redirects
stdout as the response to HTTP requests. This serves as an encrypted file download for the
attacker.
Integrity Checker Tool and Other Validation Checks
In our public report, we noted two code families that manipulate check_integrity.sh, a
legitimate script used during a normal system upgrade. This validation script was modified by
the actor to exit early so that it would not perform the intended checks.
Per Ivanti, the validation provided by check_integrity.sh is a separate validation feature and
not the same as the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) available on their website. They recommend
that organizations use the online ICT to confirm that hashes of files on their Pulse Secure
devices match Ivanti’s list of known good hashes. Please note that the ICT does not scan the
rollback partition.
