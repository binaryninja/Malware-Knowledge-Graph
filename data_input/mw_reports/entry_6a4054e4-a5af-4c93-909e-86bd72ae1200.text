CrowdStrike® Intelligence observed a new campaign from a LUNAR SPIDER affiliate to distribute
WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot malware on Feb. 7, 2019. However, this latest campaign is somewhat
unique due to a custom variant of a TrickBot module that (to date) is only associated with this
campaign.
The WIZARD SPIDER threat group is the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware.
This group represents a growing criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears to be a
subset. The LUNAR SPIDER threat group is the Eastern European-based operator and developer
of the commodity banking malware called BokBot (aka IcedID), which was first observed in April
2017. The BokBot malware provides LUNAR SPIDER affiliates with a variety of capabilities to
enable credential theft and wire fraud, through the use of webinjects and a malware distribution
function.
Campaigns involving both BokBot and TrickBot were first identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence in
July 2017. In these campaigns, victim machines infected with BokBot issued a command to
download and execute a TrickBot payload. A somewhat sporadic relationship between the two
adversaries has continued since then, although this most recent campaign likely signals a more
intimate phase of that relationship.

TrickBot Distribution
1/11

On Feb. 7, 2019, LUNAR SPIDER’s BokBot project ID C610DF9A was seen downloading and
executing a loader from http://tfulf[.]host/Sw9HJmXzq.exe. The custom loader
subsequently downloaded a TrickBot loader from http://185.68.93[.]30/sin.png . The
configuration file of this sample indicates it is TrickBot version 1000351 and belongs to the group
tag (gtag) sin2. The gtags with a prefix of sin have been related to LUNAR SPIDER activity
as the successor to the previously associated mom gtag prefix.
The full TrickBot configuration file, including command-and-control (C2) servers, can be seen
below.

Modified TrickBot Module
This activity follows the previous pattern of BokBot assisting in the delivery of TrickBot. However,
the most interesting thing about the custom loader is the embedded, Base64-encoded Portable
Executable (PE) file shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Base64-Encoded PE File

The embedded PE file is extracted by the custom loader, then decoded and executed. Analysis
revealed that this decoded PE file is, in fact, a modified version of the TrickBot lateral movement
module shareDll . Typically, TrickBot modules are downloaded as a dynamic link library (DLL)
with a standard set of exports, named Start, Control and Release . This DLL would then be
injected into a child svchost.exe process within the TrickBot modular framework. However, in
the absence of this framework, the shareDll module distributed by BokBot is a PE file.
In addition, the strings within a standard TrickBot module are not obfuscated or protected in any
way. However, the module distributed by BokBot contains strings that are both encrypted with 256bit AES, with a derived key and initialization vector (IV), and Base64-encoded with the custom
alphabet of terKSDozBw1l24IyCL6AHh/+5WRiGnj3xJQ8YkEbcgOZVNPamMsuUTpd0q9vFfX7. The
strings are stored in an encrypted string table (shown in Figure 2) in the exact same way as the
main TrickBot loader, and decrypted when they are needed.

Table 1 below outlines the key identified differences between the two variants of the shareDll

Table 1. Compares Key Differences Between Two Variants of ShareDLL
The primary function of the shareDll module in both cases is to attempt lateral movement within
the victim’s network, to reach machines accessible by the currently logged-on user. In the BokBot
distributed instance, once an accessible machine has been located, the modified spreader module
will attempt to download the TrickBot loader located at http://185.68.93[.]30/sin.png or
http://185.68.93[.]30/win.png and install TrickBot on the accessible network machine.
The whole process of BokBot installing TrickBot on the local machine and moving laterally around
the network is illustrated in Figure 3.

Renamed Modules
Beginning on Feb. 8, 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed further development in this
intriguing relationship when renamed TrickBot modules were delivered to victims of the gtags
sin2 and sin4 . These gtags have been closely associated with LUNAR SPIDER activity. The
renamed modules and their respective SHA256 hashes are shown in Table 2 and contain the
strings sin, tin , and win .

Table 2. Renamed Modules and Associated SHA256 Hashes
Unlike the changes identified in the TrickBot module shareDll being distributed by BokBot, the
modules sharesinDll, tabtinDll, and wormwinDll remain functionally equivalent to the
TrickBot deployed modules shareDll, tabDll, and wormDll , respectively, and retain the
typical characteristics of a TrickBot module. More explicitly, the modules are DLLs, contain no
encrypted strings, and have the standard TrickBot exports of Start, Control, and Release .
CrowdStrike Falcon®endpoint provides protection coverage against these threats through
behavioral IOA and machine learning.

Conclusion
It is unclear at this stage what purpose the module renaming serves, but it may be a method of
tracking activity from those modules specifically associated with the aforementioned gtags.
Additionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence is exploring a possible connection between the TrickBot
affiliate operating sin -prefixed TrickBot gtags and the BokBot affiliate operating the project ID
C610DF9A , due to the recent introduction of the previously mentioned custom TrickBot module. Of
note, BokBot has aided the distribution of TrickBot, with the standard module set, through other
BokBot project IDs for some time.
Another key point to note about this recent development is the historical relationship that previously
existed between the developers and operators of the banking malware families Dyre (aka Dyreza)
and Neverquest (aka Vawtrak). This relationship is key because:
WIZARD SPIDER includes members that were a part of the same group that had developed
and operated Dyre.
LUNAR SPIDER includes members that were a part of the same group that had developed
and operated Neverquest.
Despite being successful malware operations, both Dyre and Neverquest suddenly ceased
operating in November 2015 and May 2017, respectively (Figure 4). LUNAR SPIDER had already
introduced BokBot to the criminal market at the time Neverquest operations ceased, suggesting
that the malware change may have been planned.
Conversely, the Dyre operation ceased following Russian law enforcement action in which the
offices of a Moscow-based film and production company, named 25th Floor, were raided in
November 2015. Although no details were released by Russian law enforcement, it was speculated
that the office played a part in the operation of Dyre. There was a one-year delay before the
release of the TrickBot malware, which contains key similarities to the Dyre malware, but the
operation was immediately successful and grew swiftly.

6/11

Figure 4. Timeline of Malware Operating Dates

Although BokBot has aided the distribution of TrickBot since 2017, the development of custom
TrickBot modules for the specific campaign has not been observed before. This significant
development demonstrates a close relationship between the members of LUNAR SPIDER and
WIZARD SPIDER. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the historical relationship established
during the operations of Dyre and Neverquest has been reinvigorated and solidified now that both
WIZARD SPIDER and LUNAR SPIDER have established successful malware operations.
