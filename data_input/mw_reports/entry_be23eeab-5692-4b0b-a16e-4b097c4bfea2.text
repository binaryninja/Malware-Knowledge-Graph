Introduction

This blog post is part of an ongoing series of analysis on MoqHao (also referred to as Wroba
and XLoader), a malware family commonly associated with Roaming Mantis. MoqHao is
generally used to target Android users, often via an initial attack vector of phishing SMS
messages (smishing).

1/13

The threat group behind Roaming Mantis are characterized as Chinese-speaking and
financially motivated, first public acknowledgement goes back to around 2018. The group
has historically targeted countries in the Far East – Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, but they
are expanding their campaign.

2/13

In our most recent post (MoqHao Part 2: Continued European Expansion), we demonstrated
how Roaming Mantis had widened their sights to Western countries, including France,
Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In this post we will explore whether Roaming Mantis have continued to expand their
operations over the past year, focusing on their activities in recent months. In doing so we
will seek to highlight some techniques which we have utilized to pivot to connected
infrastructure.

Key Findings

Identification of 14 MoqHao C2 servers, based on malware analysis and pivots within
contextual data sets.
Evidence of Roaming Mantis campaigns targeting every continent, with Africa, Asia,
and Europe the most impacted.
Close to 1.5 million victim communications to the MoqHao C2 servers observed since
the end of 2022.
The scope of Roaming Mantis continues to grow; all mobile users should be conscious
of smishing threats, particularly from operators who have evolved their campaigns over
several years.

MoqHao Command & Control

As in previous posts, our analysis begins with the identification of infrastructure utilized for
the purpose of post-infection communications, once a malicious APK (MoqHao) has been
installed on a victim device.

3/13

The rationale for this approach is two-fold:

1. The delivery and installation methodology for MoqHao includes the use of ‘disposable’
staging infrastructure which generally utilizes Dynamic DNS services, in addition to
legitimate platforms, such as Baidu, Imgur, Pinterest, and VKontakte. Analysis of
network telemetry data associated with these phases of an infection is complicated by
the presence of security research, scanning, and (large volume) benign user activity.
Furthermore, until beacons to a Moqhao C2 server are observed, it is not wholly
accurate to identify any communications as ‘victim’ related.
2. Whilst MoqHao’s delivery infrastructure has a short shelf life, its C2 infrastructure is
used for extended periods of time and in some cases even reused after periods of
inactivity. By analyzing stable infrastructure, we can draw higher level conclusions on
targeting, i.e., where large groupings of victim connections originate from. In addition,
as this infrastructure is more static, by disclosing it we can have the greatest impact on
Roaming Mantis operations.

Our initial method of identifying MoqHao C2 infrastructure is based on analysis of malware
samples. In this case we have started with three malware samples identified within our
internal malware holdings, which are also available in VirusTotal.

MoqHao is detected by several antivirus vendors as ‘Wroba’, querying for this string within
malware repositories will generally lead to connected samples.

This file was first uploaded on 24 October 2022 by a user in Canada, it is configured to
receive C2 information (91.204.227.31:28877) from a user profile on VKontakte.

Examining network telemetry for 91.204.227.31 (HDTIDC - South Korea) we observe a
campaign targeting users in Australia, with the most recent victim connections occurring
around 29 January 2023.

Open Ports information for 91.204.227.31 identifies that TCP/5985 was open during the
period when victim connections occurred. The banner data obtained from scanning that port
contains reference to a Computer / Domain Name - WIN-VLVN3FLKKGL.

Figure 2: Open Ports Information for 91.204.227.31

5/13

Pivoting on the WIN-VLVN3FLKKGL value we identified four additional IP addresses, all
within 91.204.227.0/26.

We found victim communications to three of these IP addresses, two of which were identified
in previous reporting (by Kaspersky) as MoqHao C2 servers:

91.204.227.32 << Kaspersky C2
91.204.227.33 << Kaspersky C2
91.204.227.51

The first two C2s are used in campaigns primarily targeting users located in Asia, but also
Australia (as was the case with 91.204.227.31). A significant proportion of victims were in
Japan, Nepal, and Thailand.

91.204.227.51 was used as the C2 server for a campaign targeting users in France, with the
last victim connections observed around 26 February 2023.

This file was first uploaded on 20 February 2023 by a user in Canada, it is configured to
receive C2 information (198.144.149.142:28866) from a user profile on VKontakte.

Examining network telemetry for 198.144.149.142 (NETMINDERS - Canada) we observe a
campaign targeting users globally - in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania,
with victim connections still occuring at the time of writing.

Open Ports information for 198.144.149.142 identifies an RDP certificate hosted on
TCP/3389 with a Common Name value of sid380.

Figure 3: Certificate Data for 198.144.149.142

Pivoting on the sid380 value we identified 12 additional IP addresses, all within
198.144.149.128/28.

We found victim communications to one of these IP addresses, which was identified in the
Kaspersky reporting as a MoqHao C2 server:

7/13

198.144.149.131 << Kaspersky C2

As in the case of 198.144.149.142, this C2 is used in campaigns targeting users globally,
further including South America (Brazil and Suriname).

This file was first uploaded on 25 February 2023 by a user in Japan, it is configured to
receive C2 information (91.204.227.43:29872) from a user profile on VKontakte.

Examining network telemetry for 91.204.227.43 (HDTIDC - South Korea) we observe a
campaign targeting users in India, with the most recent victim connections occurring around
03 March 2023.

Open Ports information for 91.204.227.43 identifies that TCP/5985 was open during the
period when victim connections occurred. The banner data obtained from scanning that port
contains reference to a Computer / Domain Name - M172-17-64-184.

Figure 4: Open Ports Information for 91.204.227.43

8/13

Pivoting on the M172-17-64-184 value we identified 13 additional IP addresses, all within
91.204.227.0/26.

We found victim communications to seven of these IP addresses, one of which was identified
in the Kaspersky reporting as a MoqHao C2 server:

91.204.227.37
Campaigns targeting users in Turkey and the United States.

91.204.227.39 << Kaspersky C2
Campaigns primarily targeting users in India and Nepal, with additional targeting in the
Middle East and North America.

91.204.227.41
A campaign targeting users in South Africa.

91.204.227.42
Campaigns primarily targeting users in Europe (Austria and Czech Republic), with additional
targeting in Asia and the Middle East.

91.204.227.47
Campaigns targeting users in Malaysia and Nepal.

91.204.227.48
A campaign targeting users in the Czech Republic, with additional targeting in Belgium, the
Dominican Republic, and Turkey.

9/13

91.204.227.49
Campaigns targeting users in India, Portugal, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, with
smaller clusters of victims globally (Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and
Oceania).

Conclusion

Whilst this analysis is caveated by the fact it is based on sampled data, and that some
researcher / scanning activity likely slipped through our net, we were able to identify
connections, indicative of victims, from 67 distinct countries.

Approximately 80% of connections were from the East Asian region (primarily Japan), which
could be referred to as the ‘traditional’ operating base of Roaming Mantis. However, when
you remove those connections from the data, you’re left with a picture of the operators’
efforts to expand globally.

Figure 5: Spread of Victim Communications

10/13

Users from Africa, other regions in Asia, and Europe in particular are increasingly appearing
in victim communications to MoqHao infrastructure.

Smishing often doesn’t receive the same level of attention as phishing when it comes to the
malware delivery stakes. But, with over 1 million observed victim connections since the end
of 2022 related to Roaming Mantis alone, it is clearly a viable initial access vector.

If Roaming Mantis can develop their delivery methods globally, to match the depth and ‘real
feel’ spoofing of their East Asian campaigns, we would anticipate that the threat to users will
continue to grow over coming months and years.

Recommendations

We encourage continued education on mobile device security in general and smishing
more specifically, to arm users with the knowledge required to identify and avoid
threats.
Where feasible, connections to the static MoqHao C2 servers listed in the IOC section
below should be pre-emptively blocked.
Users of Pure Signal Recon can track MoqHao campaigns based on the methods
described in this blog post.
