The Emotet malware operation is again spamming malicious emails as of Tuesday morning
after a three-month break, rebuilding its network and infecting devices worldwide.
Emotet is a notorious malware distributed through email containing malicious Microsoft Word
and Excel document attachments. When users open these documents and macros are
enabled, the Emotet DLL will be downloaded and loaded into memory.
Once Emotet is loaded, the malware will sit quietly, waiting for instructions from a remote
command and control server.
Eventually, the malware will steal victims' emails and contacts for use in future Emotet
campaigns or download additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike or other malware that
commonly leads to ransomware attacks.

While Emotet has been considered the most distributed malware in the past, it has gradually
slowed down, with its last spam operation seen in November 2022. However, even then, the
spamming only lasted two weeks.

Today, cybersecurity firm Cofense and the Emotet-tracking group Cryptolaemus warned that
the Emotet botnet had once again resumed sending emails.
"As of 1200UTC Ivan finally got E4 to send spam. We are seeing Red Dawn templates that
are very large coming in at over 500MB. Currently seeing a decent flow of spam. Septet of
payload URLs and ugly macros," tweeted Cryptolaemus.
Cofense also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the spam campaign began at 7:00 AM ET,
with current volumes remaining low.
"The first email we saw was around 7am EST. Volume remains low at this time as they
continue to rebuild and gather new credentials to leverage and address books to target,"
Cofense told BleepingComputer.
Instead of using reply-chain emails like in the previous campaign, the threat actors are
utilizing emails that pretend to be invoices, as shown below.

Attached to these emails are ZIP archives containing inflated Word documents that are over
500 MB in size. They are padded with unused data to make the files larger and harder for
antivirus solutions to scan and detect them as malicious.

These Microsoft Word documents use Emotet's 'Red Dawn' document template, prompting
users to enable content on the document to see it correctly.

These documents contain a mess of macros that will download the Emotet loader as a DLL
from compromised sites, many of which are hacked WordPress blogs.

When downloaded, Emotet will be saved to a random-named folder under %LocalAppData%
and launched using regsvr32.exe.

Like the Word document, the Emotet DLL has been also padded to be be 526MB to hinder
the ability to detect it as malicious by antivirus software.
This evasion technique shows success, as illustrated in a VirusTotal scan where the malware
is only detected by one security vendor out of 64 engines, with that vendor only detecting it
as 'Malware.SwollenFile'.

Once running, the malware will run in the background, awaiting commands, which will likely
install further payloads on the device
The payloads allow other threat actors to remotely access the device, which is then used to
spread further in the compromised network.
These attacks commonly lead to data theft and full-blown ransomware attacks on breached
networks.
Cofense says that they have not seen any additional payloads being dropped now, and the
malware is just collecting data for future spam campaigns.

Recent Microsoft changes save the day
While Emotet is rebuilding its network, the current method may not have much success after
recent changes by Microsoft.
In July 2022, Microsoft finally disabled macros by default in Microsoft Office documents
downloaded from the Internet.
Due to this change, users who open an Emotet document will be greeted with a message
stating that the macros are disabled because the source of the file is not trusted.

ANALYGENCE senior vulnerability analyst, Will Dormann, told BleepingComputer that this
change also affects attachments saved from emails.
For most users receiving Emotet emails, this feature will likely protect them from mistakenly
enabling macros unless they make a concerted effort to enable them.
This change has led other threat actors to move away from Word and Excel documents and
abuse other file formats, such as Microsoft OneNote, ISO images, and JS files.
It would not be surprising to see Emotet also move to different attachment types after this
initial campaign does not go as intended.
