The TrickBot Trojan has received an update that adds a UAC bypass targeting the Windows
10 operating system so that it infects users without displaying any visible prompts.
A UAC bypass allows programs to be launched without displaying a User Account Control
prompt that asks users to allow a program to run with administrative privileges.

Example of UAC prompt

In a new TrickBot sample, Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez discovered that the trojan is
now using the Windows 10 Fodhelper bypass.

Using Windows 10 UAC bypass
When executed, TrickBot will check if the operating system is Windows 7 or Windows 10.
If it is Windows 7, TrickBot will utilize the CMSTPLUA UAC bypass and if Windows 10, will
now use the Fodhelper UAC Bypass.
The Fodhelper bypass was discovered in 2017 and uses the legitimate Microsoft
C:\Windows\system32\fodhelper.exe executable to execute other programs with
administrative privileges.
"Fodhelper.exe is a trusted binary on Windows 10 that TrickBot uses to execute the
malware stage bypassing UAC via the registry method," Kremez told BleepingComputer in
a conversation.
When properly configured, when executed Fodhelper will also launch any command stored
in the default value of the HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command key.
As Fodhelper is a trusted Windows executable, it allows auto-elevation without displaying a
UAC prompt. Any programs that it executes will be executed without showing a UAC
prompt as well.
TrickBot utilizes this bypass to launch itself without a warning to the user and thus evading
detection by the user.

Command executed by the Fodhelper UAC bypass
As more users move to Windows 10 and as Windows Defender matures, more malware
has begun to target the operating system and its security features.
In September 2019 we reported how the GootKit banking Trojan also added the
Fodhelper bypass in 2019 to execute a command that whitelists the malware executable's
path in Windows Defender.
In July 2019, TrickBot also targeted Windows Defender by trying to disable various scan
options. With the inclusion of Fodhelper, we continue to see the malware developers
attempt to reduce the security features found in Windows 10.

any remediation?

No, unfortunately not. Microsoft does not give UAC bypasses much priority.

Here's hoping they might now? Or is that expecting too much?

Best thing you can do is crank UAC to up to the max setting. Then it will still pop up a
UAC prompt even when windows trusted executable need admin privileges.

You can set UAC to "Always Notify" and you should be safe from this bypass attack.
EDIT: i'm too late :)

The world: Windows in insecure
Microsoft: OK, here's UAC
Malware writer: Lets use fodhelper.exe to bypass it
Microsoft: ...

How do you set UAC to "Always Notify" ? Explain, step by step!
also: MSFT itself does not reliably sign every piece of software it publishes. Why? If
they can't even follow their own rules, then what's the point of UAC ? Am I getting this
right? Is there something I should know?
