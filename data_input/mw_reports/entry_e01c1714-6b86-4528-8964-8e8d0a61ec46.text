Indicators of Compromise Associated with Hive
Ransomware
Summary
Hive ransomware, which was first observed in June 2021 and likely
operates as an affiliate-based ransomware, employs a wide variety of
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant
challenges for defense and mitigation. Hive ransomware uses multiple
mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing
emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) to move laterally once on the network.
After compromising a victim network, Hive ransomware actors
exfiltrate data and encrypt files on the network. The actors leave a
ransom note in each affected directory within a victim’s system, which
provides instructions on how to purchase the decryption software.
The ransom note also threatens to leak exfiltrated victim data on the
Tor site, “HiveLeaks.”

Technical Details
Hive ransomware seeks processes related to backups, anti-virus/anti-spyware, and file copying and
terminates them to facilitate file encryption. The encrypted files commonly end with a .hive
extension. The Hive ransomware then drops a hive.bat script into the directory, which enforces an
execution timeout delay of one second in order to perform cleanup after the encryption is finished
by deleting the Hive executable and the hive.bat script. A second file, shadow.bat, is dropped into
the directory to delete shadow copies, including disc backup copies or snapshots, without notifying
the victim and then deletes the shadow.bat file. During the encryption process, encrypted files are
renamed with the double final extension of *.key.hive or *.key.*. The ransom note,
“HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt” is dropped into each affected directory and states the *key.* file
cannot be modified, renamed, or deleted, otherwise the encrypted files cannot be recovered. The
note contains a “sales department” link, accessible through a TOR browser, enabling victims to
contact the actors through a live chat. Some victims reported receiving phone calls from Hive actors
requesting payment for their files. The initial deadline for payment fluctuates between 2 to 6 days,
but actors have prolonged the deadline in response to contact by the victim company. The ransom
note also informs victims that a public disclosure or leak site, accessible on a TOR browser, contains
data exfiltrated from victim companies who do not pay the ransom demand.
Indicators of Compromise
The following indicators were leveraged by the threat actors during Hive ransomware compromises.
Some of these indicators might appear as applications within your enterprise supporting legitimate
purposes; however, these applications can be used by threat actors to aid in further malicious
exploration of your enterprise. The FBI recommends removing any application not deemed
necessary for day-to-day operations.

Sample Ransom Note
Your network has been breached and all data were encrypted.
Personal data, financial reports and important documents are ready to disclose.
To decrypt all the data or to prevent exfiltrated files to be disclosed at
http://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc3xw7ez7iqy6wc34gd2nekazyd.onion/
you will need to purchase our decryption software.
Please contact our sales department at:
REDACTED
Login: REDACTED
Password: REDACTED
To get access to .onion websites download and install Tor Browser at:
https://www.torproject.org/ (Tor Browser is not related to us)
Follow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:
- Do not shutdown or reboot your computers, unmount external storages.
- Do not try to decrypt data using third party software. It may cause
irreversible damage.
- Do not fool yourself. Encryption has perfect secrecy and it's impossible
to decrypt without knowing the key.
- Do not modify, rename or delete *.key.k6thw files. Your
data will be undecryptable.
- Do not modify or rename encrypted files. You will lose them.
- Do not report to authorities. The negotiation process will be terminated
immediately and the key will be erased.
- Do not reject to purchase. Your sensitive data will be publicly disclosed.

Information Requested
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden
adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the
distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee
that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced
with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders,
employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization decide to pay the
ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so
provides investigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold
them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.
The FBI may seek the following information that you determine you can legally share, including:







Recovered executable files
Live memory (RAM) capture
Images of infected systems
Malware samples
IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious
Email addresses of the attackers
A copy of the ransom note

Post-incident forensic reports

Recommended Mitigations
 Back-up critical data offline.
 Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device.
 Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion from the
system where the data resides.
 Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remote access services.

 Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login
credentials and change passwords/settings if applicable.
 Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.
 Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.
 Review the following additional resources.
o The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the
United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious
Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and
common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.
o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing
& Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways
to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack.
o StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources
to tackle ransomware more effectively.
If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the
following actions.
 Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the
computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking capabilities. Ensure all
shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired or wireless.
 Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from the
network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices
that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by
ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers
and devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been
encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not
been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists.
 Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan
your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.
