Executive Summary
Trigona ransomware is a relatively new strain that security researchers first discovered in late October 2022. By analyzing Trigona
ransomware binaries and ransom notes obtained from VirusTotal, as well as information from Unit 42 incident response, we determined that
Trigona was very active during December 2022, with at least 15 potential victims being compromised. Affected organizations are in the
manufacturing, finance, construction, agriculture, marketing and high technology industries.
Unit 42 researchers identified two new Trigona ransom notes in January 2023 and two in February 2023. Trigona’s ransom notes are unique;
rather than the usual text file, they are instead presented in an HTML Application with embedded JavaScript containing unique computer IDs
(CID) and victim IDs (VID).
Palo Alto Networks helps detect and prevent Trigona ransomware with the following products and services: Cortex XDR, Prisma Cloud and
Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security subscriptions such as WildFire) and through incident response.

Trigona Overview
The first mention of Trigona, also the name of a family of stingless bees, comes from a tweet by security researchers in late October 2022.
Malware samples were passed to BleepingComputer, which in turn published a blog post on the ransomware on Nov. 29, 2022. Unit 42
consultants also have seen Trigona firsthand in the course of incident response.
Unit 42 researchers have observed Trigona’s threat operator engaging in behavior such as obtaining initial access to a target’s environment,
conducting reconnaissance, transferring malware via remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, creating new user accounts and
deploying ransomware.

Ransomware Analysis
Ransomware Binary
Unit 42 obtained and analyzed a sample of the Trigona ransomware binary, named svhost.exe. Upon execution, the ransomware binary uses
TDCP_rijndael (a Delphi AES library) to encrypt files. The ransomware then appends the ._locked file extension, modifies registry keys to
maintain persistence, and drops ransom notes.
The ransomware binary supports the following command line arguments:
Argument

Description

/full

Performs all functions of the ransomware. Encrypts both local and network files. Creates two registry keys for persistence,
one for the ransomware binary and another for the ransom note.

/!autorun

Skips creation of registry keys for persistence

/test_cid
“test”

Overwrites default victim generated CID and replace with “test” value

/test_vid
“test”

Overwrites default VID and replace with “test” value

/p, /path
“path”

Encrypts only files contained within specified path

/!local

Does not encrypt local system files, only encrypts files on local network

/!lan

Does not encrypt local network files, only encrypts files on local system

/autorun_only
“path”

Creates registry key for persistence only. Allows for optional “path” to be provided to override default path, does not encrypt
files

The ransomware establishes persistence through the creation of two keys in CurrentVersion\Run. Keys found in CurrentVersion\Run contain
references to programs that will execute when a user logs in.
One key executes the ransomware binary whenever the user logs in, ensuring that the encryption process would resume upon reboot. The
other key ensures that the ransom note is opened every time the user logs in.

Ransom Note
Trigona’s ransom note is dropped to the system with the name how_to_decrypt.hta. The HTML code in this file contains embedded JavaScript
functionality, which displays ransom note details as shown below in Figure 1.

2/16

Figure 1. Sample Trigona ransom note.

Unit 42 researchers observed that the JavaScript within the ransom note contains the following information:
A uniquely generated CID and VID
A link to the negotiation Tor portal
An email address to contact.
The contact email shown below in Figure 2 is phandaledr@onionmail[.]org. We have also seen farusbig@tutanota[.]com used as the contact
email in other Trigona ransom notes.

Figure 2. Embedded JavaScript

containing campaign ID and victim ID.

Victimology
By looking at the victim ID in the embedded JavaScript in the Trigona ransom notes, we were able to identify at least 15 potential victims that
were compromised in December 2022. We also identified two new Trigona ransom notes in January 2023 and two in February 2023.
Trigona ransomware has been linked to compromises impacting multiple organizations worldwide, in sectors including manufacturing, finance,
construction, agriculture, marketing and high technology. The companies impacted were in the United States, Italy, France, Germany, Australia
and New Zealand.

Leak Site Analysis
When Trigona was first observed, there was no evidence of this group using a leak site for double extortion. Their ransom note pointed the
victims to their negotiation portal instead. During the investigation of this ransomware family, we observed that a researcher identified a leak
site attributed to Trigona hosted on the IP address 45.227.253[.]99.
Unit 42 researchers pivoted on the SSH key for 45.227.253[.]99 and identified three other IP addresses related to Trigona’s infrastructure:
45.227.253[.]106
45.227.253[.]98
45.227.253[.]107
Each IP shares the same SSH key of ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBMjqeyIfJyuimtE414TBCxN+lHleN5/P3CNiD4uln5xyHjyw4muLePQj2y3yOJ7

3/16

IPs 45.227.253[.]99 and 45.227.253[.]106 hosted web servers on port 8000, while 45.227.253[.]98 and 45.227.253[.]107 hosted no web
services.
We identified that 45.227.253[.]99 hosted a web server between Dec. 6, 2022, and Jan. 27, 2023. On Feb. 13, 2023, 45.227.253[.]106 started
hosting a web server with the HTML title Trigona Leaks that was active until March 3, 2023.
As shown in Figure 3, each post contained the following information:
A description of the company
The victim’s ZoomInfo page
A description of the stolen data
Links to screenshots of example files
A countdown timer
A button to bid for the data.
The “@ Place a bid” button contained a mailto link to auction@mailthink[.]net. Mailthink is a service that allows users to create temporary,
disposable email addresses.

Figure 3.

Trigona leak site.
While the leak site was active, there were four victims:
Victim 1 has a near-duplicate post on the BlackCat (ALPHV) leak site and a countdown timer of over 300 days. Security researchers at
Arete Incident Response recently observed Trigona leveraging BlackCat’s reputation and data leak site to pressure and extort victims. It’s
unclear whether Victim 1 was impacted by Trigona.
Victim 2 has a duplicate post on the BlackCat (ALPHV) leak site and a countdown timer of over 300 days. It’s unclear whether Victim 2
was impacted by Trigona.
Victim 3 has an associated ransom note on VirusTotal and a countdown timer of just over 30 days. Unit 42 assesses with high confidence
that Victim 3 was impacted by Trigona.
4/16

Victim 4 is not mentioned on any other ransomware gang’s leak site and has a countdown timer of over 300 days. Unit 42 did not identify
any associated ransom notes and it’s unclear whether Victim 4 was impacted by Trigona.
The countdown timers of over 300 days for Victims 1, 2 and 4 were well beyond the usual timeframe that we have observed in incident
response cases where attackers demand payment, which is between two and four weeks.
Given the following features, the Unit 42 team believes with moderate confidence that the surface web leak page was a development
environment to test out features before a possible move to the dark web:
Several posts appear to be duplicates from the BlackCat leak site (as shown in Figure 4)
Several of the countdown timers are considerably longer
The leak site is no longer available on the surface web

Similarities to CryLock Ransomware
Trigona operators share overlap in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with CryLock ransomware operators, suggesting that
ransomware threat actors that once deployed CryLock ransomware might have moved on to deploying Trigona ransomware. The email
associated with Trigona ransom notes analyzed by Unit 42 (phandaledr@onionmail[.]org) was mentioned in an online forum discussing
CryLock ransomware, as shown below in Figure 5.

5/16

Figure 5. A

user on SafeZone, a Russian anti-malware forum, seeking help for Crylock ransomware.
Both ransomware families also drop ransom notes in HTML Application format, named how_to_decrypt.hta. There are also similarities in the
ransom message, including:
Their claim that all “documents, databases, backups, and other critical” files and data were encrypted
AES as their choice of cryptographic algorithm
Their statement that “the price depends on how soon you will contact us”

Tools and Techniques
Unit 42 has seen evidence of malicious activity associated with Trigona originating from a compromised Windows 2003 server, followed by the
threat operators executing NetScan for internal reconnaissance.

NetScan
Unit 42 analysts recovered the NetScan output and noticed that it contained Cyrillic characters, as shown below in Figure 6. Changing the
default language of NetScan to Russian is an option that can be configured upon initial installation.

Figure 6. NetScan output that operator(s) left on disk containing Cyrillic characters.

After conducting reconnaissance, Trigona operators used Splashtop – a remote access and management (RMM) tool – to transfer the
following malware into the target’s environment.
Threat actors often abuse, take advantage of or subvert legitimate products for malicious purposes. This does not necessarily imply a flaw or
malicious quality to the legitimate product being abused.

Start.bat
Start.bat is a batch script that performs the following activities:
It creates a new folder at C:\temp
It copies other malicious batch and EXE files from a compromised internal Server Message Block (SMB) server to the newly created
temp folder
It executes Turnoff.bat

6/16

Turnoff.bat
Turnoff.bat is a cleanup script used to remove evidence of the attack on a system. It does so by performing the following activities:
Clearing the Recycle Bin of any mounted drive
Attempting to use sc stop and taskkill to stop over 100 services related to various areas ranging from remote desktop tools to Windows
Defender
Attempting to stop services related to VMware, Hyper-V and SQL
Ending several running tasks related to the stopped services mentioned above
Clear Windows Event Logs (using wevutil cl)
Deleting Volume Shadow Copies
Disconnecting all network drives
Unit 42 researchers have observed that cleanup scripts from other threat actors are usually smaller and more specific to the tools used by that
actor. The scattershot variety of services and tasks that turnoff.bat stops could suggest that the tool is attempting to ensure that a wider variety
of systems are encrypted.

Newuser.bat
Newuser.bat is a batch script that creates a new user with the name fredla and the password Qw123456. It then adds the fredla user to the
local groups Administrator and Remote Desktop Users. Threat actors sometimes create privileged user accounts to keep access to target
systems without having to install persistent remote access tools on the system.

DC2.exe
DC2.exe contains a password protected version of Mimikatz, which is a tool used for extracting sensitive information such as passwords and
authentication credentials from a Windows operating system.
This version of Mimikatz has been compressed using UPX. While UPX is often legitimately used to reduce file size, we have observed threat
actors utilizing UPX and other packing programs to evade static detection of the underlying payload.
The tool is also password protected, which adds an extra layer of complexity when ascertaining the program’s functionality.
When the executable is run, the threat actor is prompted for a password to continue. The MD5 hash of the password is then calculated, and if it
is equal to 4dbf44c6b1be736ee92ef90090452fc2, the program will continue running.
The password required to achieve the MD5 hash is boris.
Among its many legitimate uses, Unit 42 researchers have most often observed Mimikatz being leveraged maliciously by threat actors in the
following ways:
Credential Loading
Mimikatz loads credentials from various sources such as Windows memory, Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
process and the Windows registry.
Credential Dumping
The tool then extracts and dumps the credentials, including usernames and passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets to the screen
or to a file.
Credential Manipulation
Mimikatz allows the user to manipulate the dumped credentials, such as changing passwords, creating new user accounts and
adding users to groups.
Credential Injection
The tool can also inject the manipulated credentials into other processes, allowing the user to impersonate another user and gain
access to restricted resources.

DC4.exe
DC4.exe is a small, UPX-packed password protected binary that generates and executes an embedded batch file. Like DC2.exe, the password
to allow the binary to run is boris.
Upon execution, the batch file makes the following changes to the system:
1. Disables the User Account Control (UAC) and sets cmd.exe as a debugger for HelpPane.exe, utilman.exe, Magnify.exe and sethc.exe.
This is a common method of creating a “Sticky Keys backdoor” that allows for the creation of a command prompt with NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges.
2. Opens specific ports on the firewall to allow remote desktop connections using the netsh command.
3. Modifies the Windows registry to allow remote desktop connections.

7/16

4. Creates a new user account with the username sys and password Mm1518061+-, and adds this user to the Administrator and Remote
Desktop Users groups.

DC6.exe
DC6.exe is an installer for the publicly available tool Advanced Port Scanner, wrapped up in an Inno Setup installer package. Inno Setup is a
free software installer for Windows programs. Advanced Port Scanner is a tool that is commonly abused by threat actors for network scanning
and mapping, for lateral movement and discovery purposes.
Wrapping Advanced Port Scanner in Inno Setup adds an additional layer of obfuscation to the code, and it is likely to evade static signature
detection, forcing dynamic analysis to determine functionality rather than relying on traditional static code signatures.

Conclusion
Trigona is a newer strain of ransomware that, to date, has had minimal coverage by security news articles. This lack of security community
awareness allows Trigona to discreetly attack victims while other higher-profile ransomware operations dominate the news headlines. We hope
that shining a light on Trigona and its uncommon technique of using password-protected executables to obfuscate malware helps defenders
better protect their organizations against this threat.
Due to the stream of victims identified by the Unit 42 team and Trigona’s currently developing leak site, the operator and/or affiliates behind the
ransomware likely will continue (and possibly even ramp up) its malicious activity.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from Trigona threats through the following products:
WildFire currently lists all known binaries of Trigona as malicious, which will trigger alerting within Prisma Cloud and Cortex XDR.
Prisma Cloud will detect any instance of this malware being executed through properly configured Defender agents using Wildfire.
Additionally, Prisma Cloud Defender agents can be installed on Windows 2016 and 2019 servers, as well as on Windows Docker
Container hosts.
