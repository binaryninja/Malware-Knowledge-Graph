Trend Micro | Backdoor as a Software Suite: How TinyLoader Distributes and Upgrades PoS Threats

Introduction
The tandem of TinyLoader backdoor and a point-of-sale (PoS) threat, AbaddonPOS was first
reportedly seen in November 2015. When we noticed a sudden spike in AbaddonPOS
detections just this January, TinyPOS, another PoS malware strain, has also reared its ugly
head that time. This prompted us to probe further on these threats and check if they are in any
way related to one another.
Our analysis reveals that TinyLoader, a backdoor used for secondary malware infection, is
distributing and managing the upgrades of AbaddonPOS. Likewise, TinyLoader is also
spreading TinyPOS variants. This leads us to conclude that the operators behind TinyPOS and
AbaddonPOS are one and the same.
In this technical brief, we’ll discuss the ties that bind TinyLoader with two notorious PoS
threats—AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS, including how the perpetrators behind this operation
deployed their arsenals.

TinyLoader—The Not-So-Missing Link?
It’s always good to examine the entry points of PoS malware in their target environment to
understand these threats better. Initial information on AbaddonPOS details its links to
TinyLoader backdoor, which Trend Micro detects as BKDR_TINY, BKDR64_TINY or
TROJ_TINY.
TinyLoader can run any shellcode on the system and its primary function is to introduce
secondary infections on the environment. That being said, seeing TinyLoader in an environment
is not the leading or sole indicator of PoS threats as it can be directed to do other malicious
activities. For the purpose of this write-up, we checked any indicator connecting AbaddonPOS
and TinyPOS.
Based on our Smart Protection Network data, there are more TinyLoader-related infections in
Asia-Pacific and North America from the period of January-April 2016. Our data also indicate
that 64% of our detections on TinyLoader infections are mostly Windows 7 (64 Bit) platforms.

Figure 1. Global distribution of TinyLoader-related infections (January-April 2016)

Method of Operations: Testing First Before Mass Deployment
As seen in the geographical map above, there’s a widespread presence of TinyLoader-related
infections across the globe. With this established footprint, TinyLoader can selectively introduce
secondary infections based on what’s interesting in the environment it is running on. This
business model is true to any malware as a service.
TinyLoader used two very small components: a module that can take a screenshot (grabber),
and a module that functions as a process enumerator. Both modules are very small in size and
simply loaded into memory. But these modules do not necessarily have any malicious payload.
They are just used to gather information or reconnaissance on infected systems. During our
research, we identified that screenshot grabber were deployed several times a day for over an
extended period for collecting data on the system.

After TinyLoader identifies an infected system, the operator then may choose to deploy a
secondary payload. In this particular case, it was AbaddonPOS first, followed by TinyPOS. We
have identified two periods where AbaddonPOS variants were massively distributed:

Figure 3. The second wave of AbaddonPOS attacks mostly hit countries in Europe, around
March 31 – April 1, 2016
Since most of the infected environment run on Windows 7 operating system (OS), AbaddonPOS
is stored in %PROGRAMDATA%. In its initial wave, it used the file name, scheduler.exe and the
mutex, MR_D, resembling some of the documented behaviors of this PoS malware in 2015.
After this initial mass-deployment, there were small incremental file variations being introduced
throughout February 2016.
Around March of this year, we started seeing similar detections on %PROGRAMDATA%
stemming from TinyLoader. However, it used a different file name—conhost.exe. Our analysis
shows that this is still AbaddonPOS with very slight modifications. It uses now the mutex,
MR_X. This modified version of AbaddonPOS was mass-deployed at the start of April 2016.
We also noticed a binary (Sha1: 7fd44fdcc12988cb1f0811f79ec8f41bec65800f) referencing the
file names, scheduler.exe and conhost.exe. The said binary was downloaded on the same site
hosting AbaddonPOS. This binary, which we dubbed as updater component, was distributed

around February 29, 2016, a month after the initial wave. The file’s logic was quite simple:

Figure 4. The update component enumerates running processes and checks for familiar file
names in All User's application data folder. It then terminates these if found.
Aside from %ProgramData%\scheduler.exe, the updater component looks for another file,
conhost.exe in the same directory, which seemed unusual. However, this made sense when
AbaddonPOS was deployed with the file name, %PROGRAMDATA% \conhost.exe last March
2016. TinyLoader was preparing to upgrade the existing installations of the said PoS malware.
We saw that TinyLoader not only distributed AbaddonPOS but also managed the upgrades of
this PoS threat.

Ties that Bind: The TinyPOS-AbaddonPOS Connection
When a new PoS malware strain, TinyPOS emerged in threat landscape, we checked its
connection to AbaddonPOS. Since TinyPOS is hosted on the same server as AbaddonPOS
(see diagram below), it prompted us to dig deeper into these threats. We were able to identify
that TinyLoader was distributing both PoS threats.

Figure 5. Mapping of file sources and C&C servers
In addition, we also saw the updater component that cleans up process names used by
AbaddonPOS (scheduler.exe and conhost.exe) and TinyPOS (wmi_service.exe).

Figure 6. New updater component logic
Last April 2016, TinyPOS started sporting tactics commonly associated with PoS RAM scraper.
PoS RAM scrapers usually look for process names either for exclusion (similar to what
AbaddonPOS did) or for targeting. Targeting is a selective method of seeking out a known
process.

In this modification or improvement (sha1: 5b65d0a2df243412f95965f5e2cd1a17676960b1),
TinyPOS used a particular binary in memory: resdbs.exe. This binary otherwise known as
MICROS ® Database Service is part of several MICROS® software solutions. Various
industries like retail typically use these software solutions.
TinyPOS scans all other processes not included in the whitelist. It also creates a separate
thread that only monitors the Micros service. With this dedicated thread, this malware increases
its chances of capturing credit card information from the resdbs.exe process memory.

Figure 7. TinyPOS creates a separate thread dedicated to resdbs.exe monitoring.
It is also worth noting that AbaddonPOS also has a separate thread for monitoring specific
processes. However, our samples show that its list is blank. The only difference between
TinyPOS and AbaddonPOS in this particular context is the coding approach. It seems that
TinyPOS is a simplified version of AbbadonPOS.

Figure 8. AbaddonPOS coding approach
Targeting PoS software components are very common. MalumPOS and RawPOS are some
examples of PoS threats that employed the same technique. Both TinyPOS and AbaddonPOS
modified the process list to match the target environment’s point-of-sale software, similar to
what RawPOS did.
We looked at how newer versions of AbaddonPOS were distributed and found that the initial
versions of TinyPOS were distributed the same way. AbaddonPOS were tested first via
selective deployment and only when these deployments were proven successful will they only
go for wide distribution. We have yet to see a mass deployment of TinyPOS but we’re already
seeing infections within the United States and some parts of Europe.

10

Widespread Distribution
Through our research, we established that AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS are one and the same
PoS family. They cast a wide net to hit as many environments as possible and to prepare that
environment for secondary infections. This tactic is reminiscent of another PoS threat,
GamaPOS.
The combined infections of AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS have struck various industries:
•

Technology

•

Healthcare

•

Transportation

•

Education

•

Manufacturing

•

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

•

Government

This list of affected industries seems extensive but not surprising, particularly in the United
States. According to a survey released by the Strawhecker Group (TSG), only 37% of US
merchant locations are EMV-ready after the October 1, 2015 liability shift. The same survey also
revealed that the implementation has been slower than expected. The estimated adoption rate
should be at least 90% by 2017.
As merchants tried to catch up to EMV implementation, attackers are already showing a keen
interest at other verticals to hit before higher adoption takes place. They (attackers) are using
their malicious tools to infect as many PoS systems as possible before point-to-point encryption
will be fully adopted.
When the card data is not encrypted in the reader, this makes a terminal even with Chip-andPin susceptible to PoS RAM scraper malware. A non-EMV enabled terminal also allows anyone
who has duplicated card data (card-in-hand) to walk in an establishment and use that duplicated
card. He/she can also place an online transaction where details such as the three-digit security
code and billing address are not verified.

Challenges and Recommendations
On their own, a backdoor and a point-of-sale (PoS) malware can pose great threats to
enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). As a tandem, these two can lead
to stealthier and more flexible attacks.
The use of TinyLoader with a PoS threat is quite effective. Its multicomponent architecture
allows several small modules to be built depending on the need. This makes attacks less
noticeable, thus avoiding detection. The small modules also enable the secondary infection to
be successful.
The command-and-control (C&C) server of TinyLoader needs not to be a server where it gets
the components. It can be directed to connect to another site for downloading the component.
The downloaded component (secondary malware) can then report to its own C&C server.
As detailed above, TinyLoader was used like a software management suite to manage the
deployment and upgrade of both AbaddonPOS/TinyPOS. Analyzing these samples individually
would not lead to any conclusion. Acquiring only the TinyLoader executable absolutely made
no sense because one has to observe how other components are being used.
This presents challenges in both static and dynamic analysis. In static analysis of TinyLoader,
only a TCP socket connection to a pre-defined IP address and port is visible. In dynamic
analysis (where most sandboxes can only run the sample for a few minutes), a similar raw
socket connection is also seen. This means that only through actual infection can one observe
the complete infection chain—from launching tools and gathering information on the system to
secondary infection.
The businesses affected by this combined backdoor and point-of-sale threat were spread out
between single seat infections and SMBs. TinyLoader used a high numbered port to
communicate back to its own C&C server while being able to introduce additional files in the
environment via HTTP requests. This spells the importance of looking into outbound requests
(or traffic leaving the environment) aside from the common practice of restricting inbound and
outbound requests to certain known services.
Trend Micro protects customers from all threats related to TinyLoader. To protect enterprises
from malware with PoS RAM-scraping capabilities, it is best to employ endpoint application
control that reduces attack exposure by ensuring only updates associated with whitelisted
applications can be installed. Endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Security, Trend
Micro™ Smart Protection Suites, and Trend Micro Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect
users systems from AbaddonPOS, TinyPOS, and TinyLoader backdoor by detecting these
malicious files. While Trend Micro detects all indicators that were discussed here, we still are
monitoring the progression of this threat.
