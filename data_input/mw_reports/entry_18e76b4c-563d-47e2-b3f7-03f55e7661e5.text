Coronavirus is dominating the news and threat actors are taking advantage.
Cisco Talos has found multiple malware families being distributed with Coronavirus
lures and themes. This includes emotet and several RAT variants.

Executive Summary
Using the news to try and increase clicks and drive traffic is nothing new for malicious actors.
We commonly see actors leveraging current news stories or events to try and increase the
likelihood of infection. The biggest news currently is focused on the new virus affecting the
world, with a focus on China: the coronavirus. There are countless news articles and emailbased marketing campaigns going at full throttle right now, as such, we wanted to take a
deeper look at how this is manifesting itself on the threat landscape.
Our investigation had several phases, first looking at the email based campaigns then
pivoting into open-source intelligence sources for additional samples. These investigations
uncovered a series of campaigns from the adversaries behind Emotet, along with a series of
other commodity malware families using these same topics as lures, and a couple of odd
documents and applications along the way. What was also striking was the amount of
legitimate emails containing things like Microsoft Word documents and Excel spreadsheets
related to the coronavirus. This really underscores why using these as lures is so attractive
to adversaries and why organizations and individuals need to be vigilant when opening mail
attachments, regardless of its origins.
What's new? Malware authors and distributors will go through any means necessary to
achieve success and generate revenue and this is just the latest example. These lures tied
to coronavirus are likely to only increase in volume and variety as the virus continues to
spread and dominate the headlines.
How did it work? The majority of these campaigns were driven through email and malspam
specifically. These actors would send coronavirus themed emails to potential victims and, in
some cases, use filenames related to coronavirus as well, enticing victims to click
attachments. One of the reasons this was so effective was the large amount of legitimate
email related to coronavirus that also included attachments.
So What?
Organizations need to realize that attackers are going to use current events to try and
get victims to open attachments or click links. You should be prepared and vigilant in
identifying these emails and ensuring they don't make it to your users inboxes.
There is a wide variety of threats represented here so there isn't one single threat to be
concerned with, just realize there will likely be a lot more.
It's not just malicious content, there are a lot of weird executables and other files
floating around that are coronavirus-themed and are unwanted, albeit not inherently
malicious.

Malspam campaigns
2/13

During our analysis of email telemetry, we identified several malicious spam campaigns
leveraging news related to coronavirus to entice potential victims to open attachments and
initiate various malware infections. Several malware families are currently being distributed
via these malspam campaigns including Emotet, Nanocore RAT, and various trojans.

Emotet
Emotet is one of the most prevalent malware families being actively distributed. We have
previously analyzed this threat in various posts, notably here and here. Emotet distribution
campaigns are commonly observed attempting to integrate current news topics of interest in
their distribution campaigns and the current interest in CoronaVirus is no different. It has
been previously reported that Emotet has been making use of this theme in various email
distribution campaigns, which we have also observed. As previously described, these emails
typically contain malicious Microsoft Word documents that function as downloaders for the
Emotet malware.

An example of one of the malicious Word documents is below. As usual with these sort of
attachments, users are prompted to Enable Editing and Enable Content, granting the
3/13

attacker the ability to execute code on the endpoint to facilitate the delivery and execution of
Emotet, thus infecting the system.

Over the course of the past few weeks, we have observed large quantities of messages
featuring this and similar themes being used to spread Emotet to victims.

Nanocore RAT
It is important to note that Emotet is not the only malware family currently being distributed
using coronavirus-themed malspam campaigns. We have also observed Nanocore RAT
being distributed using similar types of email-based malware distribution campaigns.
Nanocore RAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) that is commonly distributed by various threat
actors. RATs are one of the more common threats we see delivered on the threat landscape.
These malware families typically provide the attacker with remote access into the system
and the ability to grab things like keystrokes, files, webcam feeds, and download and
execute files. During our investigation we did find a campaign delivering Nanocore, one of
4/13

these RATs. The campaign was a notification to customers around the status of the
coronavirus and the steps they are taking as an organization, as is shown below.

As you can see, the email came with a ZIP file attached, which contained a PIF executable.
Once the victim executed the file, Nanocore RAT was installed on the system, giving the
adversaries remote access.

Other campaigns
We did find at least one other campaign that was ongoing, but at the time of discovery the
command and control (C2) servers were down and final payload retrieval wasn't possible, but
the malicious intent was clear. This started like many of the other campaigns with a
coronavirus theme.

5/13

This particular email was notifying customers of a delay in shipping due to coronavirus and
attached a .pdf.ace invoice file. Inside the compressed archive was an executable purporting
to be a signed order confirmation. Upon execution, additional data was attempted to be
retrieved but due to the server being down, it is not possible to identify the final payload as of
the time of publishing.

Additional malware campaigns
In addition to email campaigns leveraging coronavirus, we also analyzed various opensource malware repositories in an attempt to identify additional malware making use of the
disease. We discovered several examples of malware that had been submitted to the
repositories including adware, wipers, and other various trojans.

Parallax RAT
During our open-source investigation, we came across a sample aptly named "new infected
CORONAVIRUS sky 03.02.2020.pif." This file was likely delivered as an attachment to an
email in some sort of compressed archive. Upon execution, the RAT is installed and
persistence is achieved by creating links in the user's startup folder, as well as the creation of
several scheduled tasks, and establishing command and control communications with a
dynamic DNS provider domain, which is fairly common with RAT distribution.

6/13

Parallax is another RAT not much different from the nanocore campaign we found above. It
has the same basic functionality and allows the attacker the ability to upload and download
files as well as grab things like keystrokes and screen captures.

Other samples found
During the course of the investigation, we came across several samples that appeared to be
malicious and were tagged as malicious in various engines but were, in fact, odd jokes or
non-malicious content, including a fake wiper. This file was found with the suspicious
filename of "CoronaVirus.exe" of which there were many. This particular one immediately
appeared to lock the screen upon execution.

The rough translation of the text displayed to the user is "Deleting all files and folders on this
computer - Coronavirus." Upon completion of the counter, the button at the bottom became
clickable, and when clicked, displayed the following message:

7/13

This says it is a joke and the user can press Alt + F12 to exit. If the user pushes these
buttons, it drops you back at the desktop. Upon further analysis, it does not appear there
were any other malicious actions taken. This is just one of several odd examples found in our
research including another joke game written in VBS and an odd executable wrapper of a
well-known outbreak map for coronavirus. None of these files were malicious but did take
actions that could be viewed as malicious, as such, we have seen many antivirus vendors
detect these as malicious executables. At the very least, they are unwanted applications,
albeit not inherently malicious.
One additional malware sample we discovered was a wiper designed to destroy infected
systems. It was initially submitted to various malware repositories with the filename "冠状病
毒.exe" which translates to "coronavirus." The malware, when executed on systems, uses
several techniques to delete data from both the file system and registry in an attempt to
disrupt system operations. For example, we observed the malware invoking the Windows
Command Processor and using the "rd" Windows command to iterate through the directory
structure of the C:\, deleting the contents:

8/13

It is important to note that there is no prior attempt to copy, exfiltrate, or save a copy of the
contents and the malware does not appear to make any attempt to extort victims or
otherwise generate revenue for the malware author.

Conclusion
Malicious actors are always going to do whatever they can to increase infection rates and in
turn increase revenue, this includes using the news and fear to achieve their goals. This is
one of the cases where both news and fear can be used. In a world where threats like
Emotet are stealing emails and replying in-line users need to be increasingly skeptical of all
attachments regardless of source. These attacks can be seen in an email thread with a
colleague or friend and, in some cases, may come directly from that colleague or friend.
Additionally, anything news related should be treated with a little extra skepticism, go out and
do your own research instead of just clicking links and opening documents that are sent your
way.
