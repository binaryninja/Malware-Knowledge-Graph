On March 1, 2022, ESET reported a third destructive data wiper variant used in attacks
against Ukrainian organizations dubbed as CaddyWiper. CaddyWiper’s method of
destruction is by overwriting file data with “NULL” values. This is the fourth sample of
malware IBM Security X-Force has released public content for which has been reportedly
targeted systems belonging to Ukrainian organizations (IsaacWiper,
HermeticWiper/PartyTicket). IBM Security X-Force obtained a sample of the CaddyWiper
wiper and has provided the following technical analysis, indicators of compromise, and
detections.

CaddyWiper Analysis
Upon execution, CaddyWiper first executes “DsRoleGetPrimaryDomainInformation” to
determine the machine role of the system the wiper is running on. If the domain role is
“DsRole_RolePrimaryDomainController,” CaddyWiper terminates and does not continue with
any destructive functions. According to the ESET, they observed CaddyWiper being
deployed to target systems via a Domain Controller indicating the authors designed the wiper
malware to be used in situations where the target’s Active Directory environment has been
compromised.

If the target system is not a Domain Controller, CaddyWiper begins recursively wiping all
data within “%SystemDrive%\Users” including hidden and operating system files. In the
event a file is larger than 10 megabytes, the wiper only destroys the first 10 megabytes. If a
file is currently locked by another process, CaddyWiper first attempts to take ownership of
the file via “SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege” and then resumes wiping the file.

Following “C:\Users”, CaddyWiper repeats the same process for all available drives from
“D:\” to “Z:\”. When all the available drives have been wiped, CaddyWiper targets wipes disk
partitions from “\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE9” to “\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0” by overwriting the first
2/6

1920 bytes with NULL.

Detection
IBM Security X-Force has developed the following Yara signature to help identify instances
of the CaddyWiper malware.

Recommendations
At this time, X-Force recommends organizations consider implementing the indicators listed
in this report into their security operations. Additionally, global businesses should seek to
establish sound insight into their respective networks, supply chains, third parties, and
partnerships that are based in, or serve in-region institutions. It is also advised that
organizations open lines of communications between relevant information sharing entities to
ensure the receipt and exchange of actionable indicators.
