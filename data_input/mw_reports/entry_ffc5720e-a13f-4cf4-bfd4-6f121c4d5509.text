Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Inve
the Department of Defense (DoD). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N
government. This malware variant has been identified as SLICKSHOES. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Kore
HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activi
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C
(CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This sample is a Themida-packed dropper that decodes and drops a file "C:\Windows\Web\taskenc.exe" which is a Themida-packed beaconing im
beaconing implant does not execute the dropped file nor does it schedule any tasks to run the malware. The dropped beaconing implant uses an
encoding algorithm and is capable of many features including conducting system surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution
captures.

Description

This sample is a Themida-packed dropper that decodes and drops an embedded file (MD5: B57DB76CC1C0175C4F18EA059D9E2AB2 / SHA25

create any auto-run keys or scheduled tasks to execute it.
The dropped file (taskenc.exe) is a Themida-packed beaconing implant with RAT functionality. The implant beacons to a hardcoded IP (188.165.3
hardcoded TCP port 80 every 60 seconds. The initial beacon contains the string “ApolloZeus” as well as victim information, including OS version,
address. All traffic, including the beacon, is encoded with an indigenous encoding algorithm. Due to the way the implant decodes the hardcoded s
place in memory, the first beacon contains the string in plaintext, the second beacon will contain the string encoded, and so on. This is probably u
oversight by the developers.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
