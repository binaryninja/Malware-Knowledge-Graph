Ransom DDoS Extortion Actor “Fancy Lazarus” Returns

Key Takeaways
The ransom distributed denial of service extortion threat actor known as "Fancy
Lazarus" is back, taking aim at an increasing number of industries, including the
energy, financial, insurance, manufacturing, public utilities, and retail sectors.
There is no known connection between this group and the APT actors with the same
names.
These latest campaigns have some differences to previous campaigns, including a
change to the group's name, the amount of Bitcoin being ransomed, and variations in
the email body content.
While it is not possible for organizations or companies to avoid being the target of such
attacks, there are indications that most such threats either do not materialize into an
actual attack or they are successfully mitigated.

Overview
As of May 12, 2021, Proofpoint researchers are tracking renewed distributed denial of
service (DDoS) extortion activity targeting an increasing number of industries, including the
energy, financial, insurance, manufacturing, public utilities, and retail by the threat actor
“Fancy Lazarus.” Proofpoint researchers have observed the activity primarily at U.S.
companies or those with a global footprint. The actor took over a month-long break from April
to May 2021 before returning with new campaigns that include some changes to the group’s
tactics, techniques, and procedures:
New name: The group, who have previously identified themselves as “Fancy Bear”,
“Lazarus,” “Lazarus Group,” and “Armada Collective,” among others, is now going by
“Fancy Lazarus.” There is no known connection between this group and the APT actors
with the same names.

New price: The extortion emails now have adjusted ransom pricing, lowering it from
ransoms as high as ten Bitcoin (BTC) to its current two BTC starting price. This change
is likely to account for Bitcoin’s fluctuating value.
Variation in email content: In terms of email body content, the specific variant is
reminiscent of the original variants from August 2020 with some minor changes and
evolutions. It is interesting that the group is still going back and tweaking the original
email, potentially indicating its effectiveness. Between August 2020 and
now, however, they have tried completely different text in the emails.

Background
In mid-to-late August 2020, Akamai and the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) alerted organizations to a spate of ransom denial-of-service extortion
emails from this group. According to the published reports, this group took aim at thousands
of organizations from multiple global industry verticals. In each case the threat
actor demanded Bitcoin payment or else a small-scale denial-of-service attack would be
launched with a more substantial attack mere days later.

Campaign Details
The campaigns always begin with sensational emails. The current iteration, as illustrated in
Figure 1, starts with an announcement of the name the group uses currently and an
acknowledgement that they are targeting a specific company. They then threaten a DDoS
attack in seven days, and, to prove it is not a hoax, mention a "small attack" that will be
launched on a specific IP, subnet, or Autonomous System. The emails claim that the max
attack speed will be "2 Tbps.” They also warn about potential damage to the target
company’s reputation and loss of internet access at their offices almost
certainly to further coerce the victim into complying with their demands.

Each of the campaigns is also characterized by the following elements:
Recipients: The emails are typically sent to well researched recipients, such as
individuals listed as contacts in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) or Whois information
for company networks. The emailed individuals also work in areas such as
communications, external relations, investor relations. Additionally, extortion emails are
often sent to email aliases such as help desk, abuse, administrative contacts, or
customer service.
Email body: There are three email variants sent to the same recipients conveying the
same information, except with the email body in plain text, HTML, or as a JPG image
attachment. This is a likely an attempt to evade detections.

Sender emails: Each sender email is different and unique to the targeted
company. Previously the sender often contained “Fancy Bear,” "F.B.,” "Armada
Collective,” "A.C.,” "Lazarus,” or "Lazarus Group," and even at times included the
targeted company’s highest-ranking person such as the CEO’s name. In the
most current campaign, a random “First name Last name” format is used and the
names appear fictional.
Sender email provider: Each email is created at one of the various free email
services.
Payment: Proofpoint has observed ransom demands of two BTC, which
roughly equated to $76,000 USD on May 26, 2021. The price doubles to four BTC after
the deadline and increases by one BTC each day after that. The Bitcoin addresses are
unique to each potential target.

Conclusion
While Proofpoint does not have visibility into the actual “Fancy Lazarus” DDoS attacks and
whether they are carried out, FBI reporting indicates that many affected companies that pass
the threatened deadline either do not see any additional activity or the activity is successfully
mitigated. There are, however, several prominent institutions that have either received attack
demonstrations or reported an impact to their operations, so it is important for companies
and organizations to be prepared by having appropriate mitigations in place such as using a
DoS protection service and having disaster recovery plans at the ready.
EDIT (Added on 06/11/21)
A recent report by Akamai also notes a resurgence of this activity since May 2021 and
provides a great amount of details and examples on the specific nature of the DDoS traffic.
