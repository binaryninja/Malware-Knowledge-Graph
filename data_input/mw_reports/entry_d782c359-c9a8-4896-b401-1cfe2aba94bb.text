Nemty is a ransomware that first surfaced in the wild in August 2019, reportedly spreading via
RDP with a specific focus on the APAC region. By the end of November 2019 the attack
expanded its reach using Phorpiex (also called Trik) by spreading via SMB hosts configured with
weak credentials. The ransomware encrypts the victims‚Äô files appending the suffix .nemty to
each filename, hence its name. After a few months of negligible activity, in the past few days our
sensors picked an unprecedented wave of attacks targeting, again, the APAC region. Unlike
previous attacks, the attackers clearly scaled up operations by launching a massive email
campaign using again the botnet managed by Phorpiex, this time to distribute a swarm of ZIP
archive files containing malicious downloaders implemented in VBScripts. To make the attack
more resilient, the adversaries attempt to evade defenses by relying on two different ‚Äúliving off
the land‚Äù binaries, powershell.exe and bitsadmin.exe, both downloading and executing the same
payload.
In this blog post, we detail some of Lastline‚Äôs telemetry showcasing the magnitude of the attack,
and we provide a brief overview of the most distinctive aspects of the downloader.

Telemetry Data
Figure 1 shows the last two months of telemetry data of analyzed Nemty artifacts (both payloads
and downloaders) since December 11th, 2019. As we can see, while there was not much activity
until February 7th, when the attacks reached the peak of over 7,500 instances on February 8th,
and then dropped to around 5,000 cases the day afterwards. The total number of detections
exceeded 14,000 within five days.

Since there is a high probability for the same attachment to be delivered multiple times (common
trait of spam waves), to better reflect the scale of the attack we also looked at the actual number
of emails featuring this specific downloader. Figure 2 shows the timeline of the delivered email
ZIP attachments grouped into 3-hour buckets throughout the whole campaign. The overall email
count amounts to 66,000 attachments, far above the number of actual payloads discussed
above.

All attachment ZIP files follow the pattern PIC_xxxxxx_2020.zip where xxxxxx refers to a 6-digit
number, e.g. PIC_172599_2020.zip.

It is interesting to note that all email subjects only contain one of the following smiley emojis: :-),
:-* , :), ;), ;-), 8-D, 8-), which, once rendered, look like these:
. Using a
smiley icon in an email subject can be seen as a naive social engineering technique, but due to
the payload, it is unlikely to have similarly happy consequences for the victim. A more likely

reason is that some spam detectors use email subjects (e.g., invoice, delivery notice, etc.) as an
important data point in detection heuristics, and unusually short subjects might help evade
detection.

The Dual Downloader
As mentioned earlier, all email attachments are ZIP files containing a malicious VBScript. Table
1 shows the basic information of one of the analyzed VBScript files:

Table 1: The VBScript sample analyzed in this blog post.
This is a very simple VBScript file with only three lines of code (as shown in Figure 3). It first
creates a WScript.Shell object, and then runs cmd.exe to launch the payload downloading
process. While not really sophisticated, what is interesting is that there are two command lines
relying on different services to download the very same payload, e.g., 6246258358.exe:

As Figure 3 shows, the first command line uses PowerShell to download the payload from the
remote server 92.63.197[.]190 (a known compromised host managed by Phorpiex), and save it
to the victim‚Äôs temporary directory and execute it, whereas the second command invokes the
BITSadmin service.

3/7

According to Microsoft documentation, BITSadmin (Background Intelligent Transfer Service, first
released with Windows XP) is a command-line tool used to create download or upload jobs
whenever the network connection is left idle. As it is a trusted tool by most host and network
firewalls, malware creators have been known to abuse this service since 2007. In this specific
example, it creates a high priority download job, ‚Äúgetitman‚Äù, to download the very same payload
from the same server, and execute it.
Abusing living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins, referring to legitimate OS tools or processes) such
as PowerShell or BITSadmin, to download or execute malware is, unfortunately, an increasingly
popular trend. However, using multiple executables in an attempt to increase the resilience of
the process is far less common. In this case, the attackers acknowledged the popularity of
PowerShell (almost 50% of recent threats detected by Lastline use PowerShell in one way or
another), and wanted to increase the chance of infection by adding an alternative way when the
PowerShell process gets blocked by host firewalls or AV products.
Though all VBScript files have the same malicious functionality, the content is not exactly the
same. Some files are obfuscated with garbage code attempting to evade static detection.
Figure 4 shows the fishbone chart detailing the infection chain in a controlled environment when
executing the VBScript. As we can see it involves a few interesting subjects, such as
powershell.exe (subject 3), bitsadmin.exe (subject 6) and the 6246258358.exe (Nemty
ransomware, subject 4).

Conclusions
As compared to previously reported attacks exploiting vulnerable RDP endpoints in August
2019, this time attackers massively scaled up their operation via an email campaign
weaponizing ZIP file attachments with malicious VBScripts downloading Nemty, a well known
ransomware. This last campaign relied on both PowerShell and BITSadmin to retrieve and
execute the very same payload from the same server. While not incredibly sophisticated, this
confirms a well-established trend of relying on multiple LoLBins as a technique to improve the
resiliency of an attack; in this specific case the attackers seemed to have assumed that it is

common for at least some of those binaries to be actually monitored (and blocked if acting
maliciously), and hence chose to double their chances by using both binaries for the very same
purpose.
