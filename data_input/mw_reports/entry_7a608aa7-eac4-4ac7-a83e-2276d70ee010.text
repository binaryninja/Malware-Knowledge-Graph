lawmakers
qurium.org/alerts/targeted-malware-against-crph/

March 11, 2021 (Updated April 29, 2021)
The 11th of March 2021, a mail containing a targeted attack was sent to a member of
the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH). The CRPH is formed by
elected lawmakers who were prevented from taking seats in the Union Parliament by
the military coup of the 1st of February 2021. The Pyidaungsu Hluttaw is Myanmar’s
Union Parliament.
The malicious mail sent to CRPH contained a Sender and Subject customized for the victim,
and the mail body included a link to a document in a Google Drive of the form
hxxps://drive.google.com/file/…

The mail included a link to a rar file located in a

Google Drive account.
The RAR compressed file hosted in the Google Drive contained a .lnk file with the name
2021-03-11.lnk

Once executed the following files are dropped.

37d1df5648c2e499b23b4228743f0318 SmadHook32c.dll

These files are the result

of the execution of the .lnk bundle.
The malware drops a legitimate copy of SmadavProtect32, a popular anti-virus installed in
brand new computers in the country.
To avoid anti-virus detection the malware executes the anti-virus SmadavProtect32 but it
also provides a dynamic library with it (SmadHook32c.dll). The DLL is loaded when
SmadavProtect32 is executed providing to the malware the functionality for the next stage of
infection.
The next stage is a HTTP connection to IP address 95.217.1{.}81. to request
http://95.217.1{.}81/maps/overlayBFPR where a binary encrypted payload is downloaded.

The methods and Command and Control are associated to activities performed by the
Chinese APT Group “Mustang Panda“.

The same Command and Control (C2) was used in another targeted attack in December
2020, carried out by Mustang Panda (Credit: Virustotal Intelligence).

Update April 2021
During the last week of April 2021, a new email was sent to a mailing list, the mail contained
a link to Google Drive with the file: CEC List & CRPH (Meeting minutes).rar
The compressed RAR file contained two files
1d281c5353d1b12afb9c4a4ae61e5675 CEC List & CRPH (Meeting minutes) .exe
ac18992de804cb4bc9e6aa7f7e3ad08e Acrobat.dll
The first file is legitimate copy of exch_acrobat.exe and the second file is a malicious DLL
library included by the attacker. As in the previous attack the DLL library is used to “sideload” the malware.
To ensure that the malware remains active in the compromised system, it will include a new
schedule task (MicrosoftCorp.xml) pointing to
C:\Users\Public\Libraries\ACMguid\Acrobat.exe and will add a new registry key in
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ACMguid
In a second stage of infection the malware connects to 65.21.111{.}255/maps/overlayBFPR
to download a Cobalt Strike beacon. A great video explaining Cobaltstrike capabilities is
available here

3/4

In conclusion, this attack reassembles the techniques used by the previous loader described
in this article and suggests that the same attacker is behind the malware.
