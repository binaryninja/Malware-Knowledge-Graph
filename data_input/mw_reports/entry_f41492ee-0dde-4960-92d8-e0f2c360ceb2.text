BadBlood: TA453 Targets US and Israeli Medical Research Personnel in Credential Phishing
Campaigns

2/10

March 30, 2021 Joshua Miller and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
Overview
In late 2020, TA453, an Iranian-nexus threat actor, launched a credential phishing campaign
targeting senior medical professionals who specialize in genetic, neurology, and oncology
research in the United States and Israel. TA453 (aka CHARMING KITTEN and
PHOSPHORUS) has historically aligned with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)
collection priorities, targeting dissidents, academics, diplomats, and journalists. This latest
campaign, dubbed BadBlood, is a deviation from the group’s usual activity. [1,2,3] While this
campaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it is also possible it may be the
result of a specific short term intelligence collection requirement. BadBlood is aligned with an
escalating trend of medical research being increasingly targeted by threat actors.
Proofpoint researchers have named this campaign BadBlood based on the medical focus
and continued geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.
Credential Phishing Campaign
In this December 2020 campaign, TA453 used an actor-controlled Gmail account that
masqueraded as a prominent Israeli physicist. The account (zajfman.daniel[@]gmail.com)
sent messages with the subject "Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel" and contained social
engineering lures relating to Israeli nuclear capabilities. These malicious emails contained a
link to the TA453-controlled domain 1drv[.]casa. When clicked, the URL leads to a landing
site spoofing Microsoft's OneDrive service along with an image of a PDF document logo
titled CBP-9075.pdf.

When a user attempts to view and download the PDF document, 1drv[.]casa delivers a
forged Microsoft login page which attempts to harvest user credentials. Attempting to use
any other hyperlink in the webpage results in the same redirect to the same forged Microsoft
login page, except for the "Create one!" link. This tab leads to the legitimate Microsoft
Outlook “Sign Up” page at hxxps://signup.live[.]com.

Once an email is entered by the user and “Next” is clicked, the page prompts for a password.
Once a user enters their credentials, they are then redirected to Microsoft’s OneDrive where
the benign "Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel" document is hosted.

At this time, it does not appear 1drv[.]casa conducts any sort of multi-factor authentication
bypass. Although Proofpoint does not currently have further visibility into how TA453 used
any credentials obtained from this specific campaign, public reporting from CERTFA
indicates TA453 has previously used harvested credentials to exfiltrate email inbox contents.
[4] In select prior campaigns, Iranian-aligned actors, including TA453, have used
compromised accounts for further phishing.[5]
Targeting
TA453 targeted less than 25 senior professionals at a variety of medical research
organizations located in the US and Israel. Proofpoint analysis of the targets’ publicly
available research efforts and resumes indicate TA453 targeted individuals with a
background in either genetics, oncology, or neurology. These medical professionals appear
to be extremely senior personnel at a variety of medical research organizations. Additionally,
TA453 targeting Israeli organizations and individuals is consistent with increased geopolitical
tensions between Israel and Iran during 2020. [6]
At this time, Proofpoint cannot conclusively determine the motivation of actors conducting
these campaigns. As collaboration for medical research is often conducted informally over
email, this campaign may demonstrate that a subset of TA453 operators have an intelligence
requirement to collect specific medical information related to genetic, oncology, or neurology
research. Alternatively, this campaign may demonstrate an interest in the patient information
of the targeted medical personnel or an aim to use the recipients' accounts in further

phishing campaigns. While this campaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it
is also possible it may be an outlier, reflective of a specific priority intelligence tasking given
to TA453.
Attribution
While Proofpoint cannot independently attribute TA453 to the IRGC, the tactics and
techniques observed in BadBlood continue to mirror those used in historic TA453 campaigns
and the overall targeting of TA453 campaigns detected by Proofpoint appear to support
IRGC intelligence collection priorities.[7]
In 2019, the US Department of Justice indicted four Iranian individuals for using social media
and credential phishing emails to conduct malicious computer intrusions on behalf of the
IRGC.[8] Private industry reporting identified this activity as part of CHARMING KITTEN in
both 2017 and 2019.[9,10] In early 2019, Microsoft reported TA453 was abusing well known
email brands to conduct spear phishing operations against government agencies, political
targets, and journalists on behalf of the Iranian government.[11]
Related Infrastructure
While investigating this campaign, Proofpoint Threat Research identified other domains
attributed to TA453 with high confidence based on network infrastructure components,
campaign timing, and similarity in lure documents. Both Proofpoint and VirusTotal telemetry
indicated additional actor-controlled domains were used in TA453 campaigns attempted to
compromise more traditional TA453 targets with a similar attack-chain in late December
2020. Finally, the provided lure documents at the end of the attack chain share similar,
national security themes, including Congressional Research Reports, think tank publications,
and other policy minded documents. While researchers were not able to directly correlate all
of these domains with phishing campaigns, we judge this activity to be consistent with the
BadBlood campaign.

While TA453 has consistently demonstrated a desire to collect and exfiltrate the email
mailbox contents belonging to typical intelligence targets of the Iranian government like the
Iranian diaspora, policy analysts, and educators, this TA453 campaign demonstrated a
desire to target medical researchers and providers. Further detection and analysis of TA453
campaigns will likely determine whether this targeting is an outlier or if targeting has evolved
to support the medical sector becoming a consistent intelligence requirement and target for
TA453.
While targeting medical experts in genetics, neurology and oncology may not be a lasting
shift in TA453 targeting, it does indicate at least a temporary change in TA453 collection
priorities. BadBlood is aligned with an escalating trend globally of medical research being
increasingly targeted by espionage motivated focused threat actors. [12]
