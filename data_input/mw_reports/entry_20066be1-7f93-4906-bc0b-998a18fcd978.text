BPHS basics
Bulletproof hosting servers are hardware-, software-, or application-based hosting facilities that can store
any type of content or executable code. Unlike regular hosts, bulletproof servers can primarily host malicious
content like phishing sites, pornography, fake shopping and carding sites, and command-and-control (C&C)
infrastructure.
BPHS operations are complex; diversifying bulletproof-hosting-server structures, much more so. On one
hand, bulletproof hosts need to offer solid services that ensure stability to customers. On the other, BPHS
providers aspire to appear as legitimate as possible so authorities would not shut them down. Bulletproof host
owners rent hardware colocation facilities in various countries to ensure the continuity of their operations.
They normally rely on countries with lax laws to minimize the risk of being blacklisted or shut down.

Noteworthy BPHS providers
The Russian Business Network (RBN) can be considered one of the first big BPHS providers. It was rooted
on free-hosting service providers like narod.ru, GeoCities.com (now Yahoo! Small Business), ucoz.ru, and
tripod.com, which were ad based [1]. Tagging their service offerings “free” allowed the providers to gain
popularity as hosts to small phishing campaigns and good places to store and share music and other files.
As time passed, anyone who wanted to earn from cybercrime required “professional” hosting services in the
form of bulletproof servers. Though RBN provided services worldwide, it also primarily served local clients.
Perhaps the most notable BPHS-related incident recorded in history happened on March 2013 [2], when the
infamous Off-sho.re and a group of attackers, all BPHS providers, targeted Spamhaus—a project established
in 1998 by Steve Linford to track email spammers [3, 4]. The attack caused the site to crash.

4 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Popular content and services
BPHS providers in certain countries or regions specialize in hosting different kinds of content and services.
What we listed below are just a few of the many content and service types:
•

Fakes shopping sites: These include sites that sell any kind of fake products (watches, designer clothes,
electronics, pharmaceuticals, etc.) to users in various countries where selling them may be prohibited
and punishable by law.

•

Torrent file download sites: These strictly follow internally structured rules that help them keep
their torrent files searchable and accessible [5].

•

Blackhat search engine optimization (SEO) pseudo sites: These are developed and maintained
for fully searching engines so customers can buy or sell Web traffic, which can help them get bigger
revenue from their own sites. They also act as traffic concentrators, traffic direction systems (TDSs), drop
zones, or doorways. The traffic driven to customers’ sites is, in most cases, obtained through malicious or
fraudulent techniques and tools like malvertising, fake apps, and iframes.

•

Brute-forcing tools: Sites that host these focus on discovering weak passwords and access credentials
that can be exploited and owned to compromise email accounts, server infrastructure, Web-based services,
and other online accounts. Brute-forcing tools scan networks and guess passwords to gain access.

•

C&C components: Sites that host these have environments suited for controlling networks of infected
client systems and other botnet-related infrastructure (infected file drop zones, exploit kit locations,
stolen data storage sites, etc.).

•

Virtual private networks (VPNs): These hosting facilities can act as exit points to protect their
owners’ privacy from security researchers and law-enforcement agencies.

•

Warez forums: These provide information on overriding protective measures against software and
hardware piracy. They refer to sites where key generators, cheat codes, and commercial software can be
obtained for free.

•

Files that violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [6]: Sites that host these
contain all kinds of commercially available copyrighted content, which can be downloaded free of charge.

•

Spam: Sites that host these also contain all kinds of tools used in mass-mailing attacks for profit or other
malicious gains.

Classifying BPHSs
Given the diversity of features that BPHSs offer, we devised a simple set of criteria below that would allow
fellow researchers to better classify and analyze them:
1

Business model

How do BPHS providers operate?

2

Toxicity level

How malicious (toxic/dangerous) is the content/service hosted on
a BPHS infrastructure?

3

Geolocation

Where are the bulletproof servers physically located?

Business model
BPHS providers operate in a number of ways. We’ve broken them down into three simple models.

Model 1: Dedicated bulletproof servers
Those who operate under this model know exactly what they’re doing. BPHS providers who use this business
model allow their customers to host content that may be considered illegal in certain countries.

6 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

These BPHS operators make their infrastructure appear as legitimate as possible to avoid arousing suspicion
from law enforcement. They also make their servers as takedown-proof as possible. This is why cybercriminals
often avail of their services. They will continue to make their servers available to customers unless they are
mandated to stop serving bad content.

Sample contact details of a BPHS provider
Providers who use this model often only make their ICQ or phone number publicly available. In the given
example, a provider is renting out a bulletproof server for US$70 or more a month.

Model 2: Compromised dedicated servers
Some BPHS providers choose to compromise dedicated servers. They then rent these out to parties who wish
to host malicious content. But this is a temporary setup. Once the real owner of the compromised server
detects the anomaly, the BPHS providers can no longer use the server.

one-time attack.

Sample market list of compromised dedicated servers (Дедики)
These servers can also be used as a malicious traffic proxy and act as a stolen data drop zone. Due to the
unstable availability of this service, it is rarely used for C&C activities.

Model 3: Abused cloud-hosting services
Going back to our crime ring comparison, we can think of the providers in this category as strict landlords
who run an honest business. They lease their units to tenants and don’t tolerate rule breakers. This doesn’t
stop their tenants from engaging in illegal operations in the privacy of their own units though.

Examples include
OVH, LeaseWeb

Legitimate providers may restrict the hosting of malicious content on their dedicated servers, but some
of their customers will still find ways to abuse their infrastructure. Abusive customers are only stopped
if they are reported and consequently blacklisted. In the past, we’ve seen providers like Amazon Web
Services (AWS) [7], Hetzner [8], OVH [9], and LeaseWeb [10] have their services abused by cybercriminals.
The criminals either used their infrastructure as C&C server or drop zone for stolen data.

Toxicity
The toxicity of a bulletproof server depends on the kind of content hosted on it. The more illicit or malicious
the content, the more unsafe it is to host. It is therefore much harder to find a BPHS provider that allows
highly toxic content hosting.

Note: Though none of the BPHS providers admit to hosting content related to child exploitation,
it doesn’t mean that such content may be found up on their domains.

Geolocation
A server’s physical location is always important, especially when considering what’s legal and illegal in the
countries where BPHS providers operate. Deploying a blackhat SEO doorway server or establishing an online
shop for fake watches may be legal in certain countries but not in others.

9 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

To minimize risks, attackers normally rent bulletproof servers that don’t share their intended targets’
geolocation. A BPHS customer, for instance, can attack users in the United States using an exploit kit hosted
on a server in Lebanon. The geographical distance between the BPHS provider and targets slows down the
reaction time on abuse reports.
BPHS users, meanwhile, who host content that violate DMCA prefer to be as near as possible to their
customers in order to minimize connection latency.
Diversifying BPHS infrastructure protects providers from becoming victims of distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks and blacklisting. This measure allows them to distribute resources and evade detection.
To show how diverse BPHS offerings and prices are, we analyzed a small sample. The list in the table below
is by no means exhaustive, but it does show how diverse BPHSs are.

The list of offerings in the table above is by no means exhaustive.
Bulletproof hosts may operate in countries that aren’t in the list.
A lot of BPHS infrastructures have remained relatively unchanged over time, especially in countries where
they are difficult to legally shut down. In stricter countries, BPHS providers move their servers around a
lot to keep their services online. They also use untraceable Whois details to register servers aided by fake
identification documents and/or privacy-protection legal services, which can be quite costly.

10 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Targets and exceptions
We’ve seen notifications posted on BPHS providers’ sites that claim they protect the interests of the countries
they operate from. Everything outside is fair game and can be considered targets. This could be due to two
primary reasons:
•

Local law-enforcement authorities have an easier time tracking attackers who go after victims from their
host country. These attackers are, after all, under the law enforcers’ jurisdiction. In such cases, BPHS
providers are forced to move to other countries that have laxer laws.
A good example of this is Pirate Bay. Before it was taken down in 2009, it moved its operations to
the Ukraine and has almost had no problems since then [11]. This could be due to the fact that under
Ukrainian communication laws, providers are not responsible for what their customers do. It also has
multiple backup servers in various countries.

•

Some governments either sponsor or control a number of BPHS providers. This protects the latter from
being shut down.

Warez forum notice that bans content that can harm Russia and some Eastern European countries

Pricing
BPHS prices depend on the risk involved in hosting certain content:
•

Low: BPHS providers that allow low-risk content hosting rent out their servers for as low as US$2 per
month. This kind of offer is available in several countries. Any customer found guilty of engaging in
malicious or fraudulent activities can be refused service.

•

Medium: Predominantly based in Russia and Lebanon, these servers can host both medium- and highrisk content for around US$70 (hardware) or US$20 (virtual private server [VPS]) per month.

•

High: At US$300 or more per month, a customer can host critical infrastructure projects or high-risk
content in servers mostly based in China, Bolivia, Iran, and the Ukraine.

11 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Popularity
A BPHS provider’s popularity can be determined based on forum recommendations and customer feedback.
Satisfied clients usually create forum threads to show their appreciation. Novice BPHS providers who haven’t
had many customers yet can enhance their reputations by providing a guarantee of at least US$1,000.

Sample feedback from a satisfied BPHS customer

Longevity
The reputation of BPHS providers also relies on how long they’ve been serving customers in the cybercriminal
underground without having to change their name or domain. Being able to keep their name or domain for a
long time shows that they are able to ensure the confidentiality of their customers’ activities from the prying
eyes of security researchers and law enforcers. Changing names or domains could often mean that the BPHS
provider keeps getting caught dealing with underground elements and eventually gets shut down. Longevity
can be determined by observing forum activities and reading customer feedback.

12 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

The case of RandServers
A good example of a BPHS provider is RandServers. We first encountered it being promoted by a forum user
with the handle “sosweet.”

Forum post by sosweet on darkmoney.cc promoting RandServers

Based on the underground forum thread we found, RandServers claims it can host any type of content with
some restrictions. It doesn’t, for instance, allow hosting any content related to child pornography.
Availing of RandServers’s services requires talking to its support team that gives potential customers a list
of package offerings. All packages include the use of Radware (a DDoS-mitigation application) and Cacti or
Zabbix (monitoring tools). Some also include the use of out-of-the-box solutions for hosting ZeuS, Citadel, or
CARBERP C&C servers. Others give customers an option to use virtual private or dedicated servers.

13 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Who are behind RandServers?
Forum posts on RandServers don’t contain contact information. Clicking any of the two light bulbs though
takes users to the BPHS provider’s site, http s://rand serv ers.com, which contains details on its service
offerings.

The light bulbs point to RandServers’s site that showcases its service offerings

We dug a little and found an open folder with some of the content from the provider’s old site
(ht tp://rand servers.com/lc/). This folder, however, has now been removed.

14 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

We conducted an open source intelligence (OSINT) investigation to find out more about sosweet. This person
posted RandServers ads and most likely responded to technical and sales queries on forum pages. Sosweet,
whose Jabber username is “OVERFLOW@PIZDEC.TODAY,” answered questions related to RandServers’s
service offerings.
A complaint by a user named “Fsystem” on a forum thread revealed information on sosweet, particularly the
latter’s WebMoney wallet ID, “Z186456037356.” Users don’t usually give out this ID number to just anyone.

Sosweet’s WebMoney wallet details exposed on exploit.in
This information allowed us to obtain more details on sosweet, including his name, birth date, address, and
mobile number.
A look at pastebin.com for information on sosweet turned up the document, http ://pastebi n.com/1UiJ4tZe,
which was most likely a virtual host configuration file for Nginx. It contained the email address,
overf lowpps@gmail .com. A look at the reset parameter for the email address showed the mobile number
“************9,” which was likely sosweet’s mobile number tied to his WebMoney wallet ID.
We chatted with the owner of over flowpps@gmail .com in the guise of a possible customer looking for IP
addresses or an ISP based in Western Europe. The person suggested RandServers. A sales representative
who owned the address confirmed that the provider rents colocation services from OVH to serve
customers’ needs.

Jabber chat with over flowpps@gmail .com

The following table sums up our findings on RandServers:
CRITERIA

DETAILS

Business model

RandServers follows both models 1 and 3. It has its own infrastructure
that allows it to host all kinds of content, but it also rents small
colocation environments from well-known ISPs like OVH.

Toxicity level

RandServers is highly toxic since it allows customers to host all kinds of
content, including malicious content.

Geolocation

The servers are physically located in a part of the Ukraine that is difficult
to locate and reach. The rented ones are located in the Netherlands and
Canada.

Targets and
exceptions

RandServers’s customers aren’t required to have preferred country
targets though the provider strictly disallows attacks against any entity
with ties to the Ukraine.

Pricing

Service offerings cost from US$100 a month (VPSs) to US$300 a month
(dedicated servers).

Popularity

We saw complaints regarding 24 x 7 support availability and VPS
instability.

What keeps BPHS providers alive?
Technical support
The scale of a BPHS provider’s operation isn’t really important to its customers; what matters more is its ability
to provide immediate support. Strong BPHS providers have a very good support team who communicates
with clients via ICQ, Jabber, or their own JavaScript™-based messaging service. Like legitimate providers,
their support team uses a ticketing system to process queries.

Infrastructure migration due to blacklisting
Law enforcement agencies, security vendors, and root-hosting service providers commonly blacklist BPHS
providers. This is why BPHS providers are very interested in feeds from organizations like Spamhaus and
security vendors. They constantly check if their IP subnets or addresses have been categorized as malicious.
In case these have, BPHS providers immediately move their infrastructure while conducting internal
investigations to find out which customer violated their rules.

Protection against DDoS attacks
BPHS infrastructure can be the subject of serious DDoS attacks due to various reasons. Perhaps the most
common is abusive customers. As such, high-end BPHS providers offer DDoS protection as part of their
standard package.

Software to control VPSs
BPHS clients need full control over the physical or VPSs they rent from providers. Experienced clients can
manage servers using the command-line interface though others need Windows® and a mouse to do so.
Most BPHS providers offer such for free or a fee via Web-based interfaces, which usually have installations
for File Transfer Protocol (FTP), virtual hosts, Apache, PHP, Cron, email configuration, Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), proxy, and one-click content management systems (CMSs).
Today’s markets have several applications that allow users to fully control most of the services normally
found on physical or VPSs like cPanel, ISPmanager, DirectAdmin, and Parallels Plesk.

17 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Proxying visibility using whitehat-provided services
BPHS providers sometimes hide their IP addresses behind whitehat-provided proxy services. This isn’t very
common, but techniques to protect real BPHS IP addresses from detection work, especially when they are
used to deploy and run exploits. A good example of this involves CloudFlare, which was used as a proxy by
those behind the Fiesta Exploit Kit [12].

Multilevel proxying via distributed VPS presence
Some BPHS providers allow clients to build networks of multilayer VPSs with Nginx Reverse Proxy
technology. This enables HTTP requests to pass through and allows the modification of headers and content
(as in man-in-the-middle [MitM] attacks) to hide the address of real destination servers. Strong bulletproof
protection requires a multilayer structure and specifically configured A or CNAME Domain Name System
(DNS) records with multiple IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) with high SEO scores, if
possible [13, 14]. That way, losing one VPS or FQDN due to detection and takedown from a chain of domains
and servers doesn’t affect the core VPS.
Multilevel and distributed VPS and FQDN infrastructures normally drive up hosting costs but ensure stability.
An example of a professional BPHS provider that provides multilevel VPS proxy services is Eurobyte.

Advertising
Every BPHS provider relies on advertising to gain potential clients. But because they need to stay under the
radar, they do so only on underground forums and similar venues. At present, two types of BPHS ads exist:
•

Legitimate ads: These appear as search results for a query on BPHS providers. They don’t, however,
reveal ties to malicious activity. When clicked, the links lead to Web pages with more information on the
providers’ offerings, including contact details (normally ICQ, Jabber, or Skype IDs).

•

Forum ads: Because these only appear on underground forums, BPHS providers can opt to include
details on shadier offerings. They normally take the form of clickable banners linked to forum threads
where more detailed information like that normally seen on legitimate providers’ sites is given. BPHS
providers who use these rely on “thank you” messages from clients to widen their client bases.

Forum ads for bulletproof blackhat-SEO-related services
Hosting sites for blackhat-SEO-related purposes is easy. It doesn’t require a really powerful server unless the
operation involves a TDS. All it requires are permanent links and additional doorways for crawlers.

18 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

BPHS provider with expensive offerings

Forum ads for bulletproof VPN services
Almost every BPHS provider rents out machines that can be used as VPN exit nodes. Bad actors, however,
often use stolen machines as VPN exit nodes. The second option is actually cheaper and quite stable. Bad
actors can have 2–5 exit points for less if they avail of a real BPHS provider’s offerings.

Ongoing security challenges
Given the complexity of bulletproof hosting, is it really possible to shut down BPHS operations?
In early 2013, a group of individuals with ties to the Gozi malware attacks were prosecuted for their
cybercriminal activities. One of these men was the then 28-year-old Romanian, Mihai Ionut “Virus” Paunescu,
administrator of Power Host. He provided the Gozi operation’s BPHS needs. Paunescu leased around 130
servers from legitimate hosting operations then resold them for cybercriminal use. He reportedly made €190
per month for every server he resold. Because of his negligence though, the Romanian police were able to
indict him.

Screenshot of the Power Host site taken in 2012

23 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Though Power Host was taken down after Paunescu’s arrest, accessing its domain name now redirects to
CloudFlare—a legitimate U.S. company, which interestingly provides DDoS protection and content delivery
network (CDN) services.

The role that law enforcement agencies and security vendors play in BPHS takedowns

24 | Criminal Hideouts for Lease: Bulletproof Hosting Services

Power Host’s case shows that it is possible to take down BPHS operators, but doing so will require political
will and the cooperation of security vendors. Security providers like Trend Micro identify BPHS sites that host
malicious content and block access to them to protect customers. We also cooperate with law enforcement by
passing on our research findings so they can take action as quickly as possible.
Law enforcement can place external pressure on companies that host malicious content. This kind of pressure
works well on service providers that follow the third business model. These are mostly legitimate enterprises
that don’t want to get shut down. Some hosting companies based in friendly countries like Germany often
comply to avoid any inconvenience.
In the case of providers that follow the first business model—meaning their bulletproof servers are dedicated
to hosting malicious content, and are most probably based in countries with lax regulations—international
law enforcement will have a much harder time putting pressure on them. There is an exception though.
Many BPHS providers explicitly state that they don’t allow hosting any material that exploits children. Most
countries condemn that kind of content and actively work together with law enforcement to put a stop to
hosting services that allow it.
The very nature of BPHSs is that they protect malicious activity against law enforcement, giving cybercriminals
the much-needed loophole to wriggle out of and escape from the clutches of both law enforcement and the
security industry. That loophole unfortunately largely remains open today.
Unless major changes happen in the way international laws protect or turn a blind eye to services like these,
BPHSs will continue to exist, and cybercriminals will continue to thrive. For our part, FTR will continue to
work with security colleagues in international law enforcement to drive up the cost of carrying out cybercrime
in order to make the world safe for the exchange of digital information.
