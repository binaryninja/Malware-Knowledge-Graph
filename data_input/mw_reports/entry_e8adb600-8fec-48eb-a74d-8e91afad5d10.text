A Comprehensive Look at Emotet’s Summer 2020 Return

2/26

August 28, 2020 Axel F. and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
TA542, an actor that distributes Emotet malware, took an extensive break from delivering
malicious emails in 2020. They were absent from the landscape for over five months, last
seen on February 7 before returning on July 17, 2020. While Emotet usually takes breaks
throughout the year, this was the longest known vacation for the group. Despite this break,
Emotet continues to be a dangerous threat and below we’ve detailed their delivery methods,
regional targeting, and an analysis into their use of Qbot.
Now that they are back, TA542 email campaigns are once again the most prevalent by
message volume by a large margin, with only a few other actors coming close. Proofpoint
has blocked hundreds of thousands of messages (sometimes coming close to one million)
each day. There is no clear industry targeting among TA542 campaigns.
While there are some innovations and incremental changes, Proofpoint researchers have
noted surprisingly minimal change in TA542’s tactics or tooling, considering the long break.
Many trends observed previously still remain relevant.
Significant new changes and innovations include:
Distribution of Qbot affiliate “partner01” as the primary payload delivered by Emotet
instead of The Trick. However, Emotet has previously delivered Qbot affiliate “hhhXX”
on a few occasions such as in March 2019.
A change in the Emotet mail sending module that can now attach benign attachments
along with malicious ones.
Only small incremental changes were observed in:
Emails: We continue to see a significant volume of thread hijacking and language
localization in emails. The actor continues to use generic as well as currently
newsworthy lures such as COVID-19.

3/26

Attachments / URLs: Similar to activity observed before their break, TA542 continues to
use Word attachments with macros, PDF attachments, and URLs linking to Word files.
Country targeting: The actor continues to target a core set of countries including (listed
by message volume) Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom,
and Canada, while at the same time experimenting with targeting new geographies
such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Sweden, and India.

August 18, 2020)
Precursor Campaign
Before diving into the analysis, it’s important to mention that Proofpoint and other
researchers were able to see warnings that Emotet was about to return. Those watching
active Emotet infections took notice that new email sending modules were received. It's also
possible to watch for unusual (old) Emotet email in inboxes.
On July 14, 2020 Proofpoint researchers spotted emails with old Emotet URLs, specifically
those that were previously seen in the last known Emotet campaign on February 7, 2020.
These emails came from many sender IPs, as if multiple emotet bots reactivated.
Delivery
Emotet malspam is very different from other malware email campaigns in that it starts early
and lasts throughout the whole day, making it hard to determine the end of one campaign
and beginning of the next. However, in general, campaigns start at night between 1:00am

4/26

EST and 5:00am EST. There are exceptions to this as some campaigns start much later in
the day, for example at 3:00pm EST on August 5, 2020.
Emotet campaigns can typically be seen Monday through Friday, and there is no significant
sending on weekends. There are some exceptions to this as the actor did not send malicious
email on Friday, July 24, Monday, August 3, Tuesday, August 4, or during the period of July
17, 2020 to August 18, 2020.
TA542 continues to leverage social engineering mechanisms to increase infection rates.
They compose emails in the appropriate language for the targeted country. They use simple
“call to action” emails.
Emails
A large percentage of Emotet emails use thread hijacking (replies to previous conversations),
and the subjects begin with “Re: ” or “RE: “, such as:
Re: [subject from stolen email]
RE: [subject from stolen email]
Another noticeable trend is using the recipient’s name, job function, company name, or
company domain in the subject. The Friendly-From name of the sender address often
contains the company name or domain. The email body also often contains the company
name, domain or recipient name in the greeting and signature.

Geographical Targeting
TA542 continues the trend of consistently targeting certain regions, while also adding new
countries periodically. The core regions that Emotet still targets include (listed by message
volume): Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Latin
American countries. Other regions targeted recently but less consistently include Indonesia,
the Philippines, Sweden, and India. Each country is typically targeted with appropriate
language in email bodies, subjects, filenames, and branding. Known targeted countries are
listed below (Table 2).

2020. Note that this list is not considered exhaustive.
Mistakes
There are often mistakes in the way that Emotet malicious emails are created, where
placeholders or macros are not filled in. These may be due to bugs in the code of the Emotet
mail sending capability that generates these emails. For example, we have seen
attachments with names such as those listed below. Placeholders like “{rcpt.domain}” are
meant to be completed in the domain.
estimate ui00071 from {rcpt.domain-1-up}.doc
invoice-e00889 from {rcpt.domain}.rtf.doc
g1:regex:(invoice|profile|document|doc|doc|document|payment advice
note|invoice|attn|invoice|verification letter|status update|invoice status update|invoice
id|invoice for service|08_2020 invoice for service|your invoice|past due invoice|order
confir.doc
There are also placeholders in the email body such as those shown below. A Spanish
language email screenshot in Figure 3 illustrates this.
{FROM.NAME}
{MSG.MESSAGE}
Example Emails
This section highlights email lures from some of the more notable TA542 campaigns.
The figure below shows the following emails:
Indonesian language email targeting Indonesia. The subject “faktur dari” translates to
“invoice from”. (top left)
Hindi language email targeting India and utilizing thread hijacking. The “कृपया संल न फॉम
देख।” text in the body of the email translates to “Please see the attached form.” (top
right)
Filipino language email targeting Philippines. The attachment name “impormasyon ng
contact.doc” translates to “contact information.doc”. Note that this email contains both a
Word attachment and a URL linking to a malicious Word file (bottom right)
Swedish language email targeting Sweden. The subject “Dagordning för det
kommande mötet på fredagen” translates to “Agenda for the upcoming meeting on
Friday” (bottom left)

emails.
The figure below shows the following emails:
COVID-19 lure: On August 7, 2020 we began to see emails with attachment filenames
that included “COVID-19” strings, such as “cd-8423 medical report covid-19.doc” and
“covid-19 report 08 11 2020.doc”.
Japanese Bitcoin extortion: Extortion emails in Japan are back. We saw them before
Emotet took a break with an almost identical message.

We confirmed open source reports that there are examples of Emotet emails that include
benign attachments along with malicious ones. These make up a minor portion of Emotet
email. Examples below show benign PDF attachments along with malicious Word
attachments.

Attachments/URLs
The malicious content included in the emails sent by this threat actor is either a URL or an
attachment, and sometimes but rarely both a URL and an attachment in the same email.
Word attachments are seen every day, URLs linking to Word files are also seen every day,
and PDFs attachments are seen occasionally. Demonstrated for the period of July 17, 2020
to August 18, 2020:
2020-07-17: Word attachments, URLs

Attachments
Most often an attachment is a Word document with macros, and less commonly a PDF.
Other attachment types that the actor is known to use, specifically JScript or Zips, have not
been observed since Emotet returned.
The Word attachments are first-stage downloaders that attempt to download the Emotet
payload using macros from one of several (typically 5) hardcoded payload URLs. A new set
of five payload URLs is seen periodically, as frequently as every 1 to 2 hours. Different
documents may use the same set of 5 URLs. On any given day we observe up to 100 total
payload URLs.
Note: On August 18, 2020 we started observing Word files with 6 or 7 payload URLs.
The PDF attachments contain an embedded URL linking to a site hosting a similar macro
Word document.

Figure 6: TA542 most commonly uses Microsoft Word documents with macros. The actor
periodically updates the visual lure used in the document. This collage shows two of the
observed lures.

Figure 7: Examples of PDF attachments observed.
Emotet has a small library of templates for their PDF file names:

[2 letters]-[4 digits] report p[1 number].pdf

qx-6971 report p2.pdf

soc report [date].pdf

Conversely, they have a large and varying library of file name templates that they use for the
Word documents, below examples represent a small fraction of possibilities. Word
attachment names are not always English–they may be in a language appropriate to the
targeted geography.

Table 4: Examples of Word document file names
File names that stood out: On August 7, Proofpoint saw attachment filenames that included
“COVID-19” strings, such as “cd-8423 medical report covid-19.doc” and “covid-19 report
08 11 2020.doc”. These names are still in use at the time of writing.
Extension mismatches: Some emails have attachment file names with a .docm, .rtf, or .zip
extension, where they should be .doc extensions. This may be accidental or a deliberate
attempt to evade detection. We did not do thorough testing, but we know that Microsoft Word
can open some of these attachments without errors despite the mismatch. For example,
Word 2010 can open the files with .rtf extension.

17/26

Figure 8: Example emails showing the extension mismatch

URLs
We have not observed changes in the way that this actor embeds URLs in emails. The URLs
are still frequently hosted on compromised sites, including vulnerable WordPress
installations. The URLs hosted on compromised WordPress CMS sites are obvious to spot
as they are often hosted with “wp-content”, “wp-admin”, “wp-includes” and other similar folder
structure. For other URLs it is not immediately obvious how the actor compromised the sites
since there are a range of servers (i.e. Apache, nginx, IIS), databases (i.e. MySQL),
languages (i.e. PHP), libraries, plugins, eCommerce frameworks, etc.
The actor typically adds a nested structure of one or more folders on the compromised site
and hosts a malicious PHP script that initiates the download of the payload. Currently we
only observe URLs leading to Microsoft Word documents with macros.
Malware: Emotet
We have not done extensive comparative reverse engineering and review of Emotet and its
modules, but components that we analyzed had very little change. Emotet still uses the
same way to store configuration and the same network command and control protocol.

18/26

We confirmed open source reports of a change in Emotet mail sending module now
attaching benign attachments along with malicious attachments.
Emotet Payload: Qbot
Qbot affiliate id “partner01” is the primary payload dropped by Emotet seen almost daily.
However, Emotet has previously delivered Qbot affiliate “hhhXX” on a few occasions such as
in March 2019, January 2019, May 2017, and April 2017. Before Emotet disappeared from
the landscape, it primarily delivered The Trick affiliate “morXX” in January and February
2020.
Example Qbot “partner01” sha256 hashes observed between July 17 and August 18:

Conclusion
Since returning from an extended vacation, TA542 email campaigns are once again the most
prevalent by message volume by a large margin, with only a few other actors coming close.
They have introduced code changes to their malware, such as updates to the email sending
25/26

module, and picked up a new affiliate payload to distribute (Qbot). They continue to
experiment with delivery to new countries. Despite these changes we also noted that many
of their other methods and tooling have remained relatively unchanged from previous activity
since their return. Current lures, delivery mechanisms, and widespread geographic targeting
are all similar to what we have observed in the past. Whether they iterate and change their
tactics or continue in the same manner, Emotet remains a highly dangerous threat.
