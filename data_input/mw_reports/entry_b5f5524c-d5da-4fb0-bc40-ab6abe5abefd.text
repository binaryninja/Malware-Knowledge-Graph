This report is a technical overview of the IsaacWiper malware reported by ESET on March 1,
2022. The malware was primarily delivered to Ukrainian organizations coincident with the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is intended for those looking for a high-level overview of the
malware’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and mitigations.

Executive Summary
Following recent wiper attacks against Ukrainian organizations involving the WhisperGate
and HermeticWiper malware, a new destructive wiper, IsaacWiper, was observed on
February 24, 2022. Although no direct attribution for IsaacWiper or the other wiper malware
found targeting Ukraine has been made by researchers, the timing of these destructive
attacks in conjunction with tensions and kinetic conflict in Ukraine suggests they are Russian
in origin.

Key Judgments
IsaacWiper is a destructive malware that overwrites all physical disks and logical
volumes on a victim’s machine.
There is no code overlap between IsaacWiper, HermeticWiper, or WhisperGate.
IsaacWiper achieves a similar outcome by different means.

Background
In a report released on March 1, 2022, ESET researchers identified a new destructive
malware that had been affecting a Ukrainian government network since February 24, 2022.
This malware, dubbed IsaacWiper, is distinct from the HermeticWiper malware previously
reported. ESET stated that they observed IsaacWiper deployed at a Ukrainian organization
that was not previously affected by HermeticWiper, although they are still assessing any links
between IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper. Furthermore, they are unable to attribute this
malware to any known threat actors due to a lack of significant code similarities with known
malware. One day after IsaacWiper was initially deployed, the threat actors deployed a
second version that included debug log output, indicating that the malware was not working
as intended.
