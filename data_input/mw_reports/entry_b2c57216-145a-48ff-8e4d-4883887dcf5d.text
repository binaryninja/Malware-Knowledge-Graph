1. Executive Summary
Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is an actor involved in several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
campaigns that have been active since at least the end of 2010. Targeted sectors include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Industrial/machinery
Manufacturing
Pharmaceutical
Construction
Education
Information Technology

Most of the victims we identified fall into the industrial / machinery building sector, indicating this
is of special interest.
To infect the victims, the attackers rely on three methods:
• Spear-phishing e-mails using PDF documents embedded with an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-20110611)
• Trojanized software installers
• Waterhole attacks using a variety of re-used exploits
During the attacks, the Crouching Yeti use several malware/Trojans, which exclusively infect
Windows systems:
•
•
•
•
•

Havex Trojan
Sysmain Trojan
The ClientX backdoor
Karagany backdoor and related stealers
Lateral movement and second stage tools

For command and control, these connect to a large network of hacked websites. These sites host
malware modules, victim information and serve commands to infected systems.
The dozens of known Yeti exploit sites and their referrer sites were legitimate, compromised sites.
They ran vulnerable content management systems or vulnerable web applications. None of the
exploits used to compromise the servers were known to be zero-day. None of the client side exploits
re-used from the open source Metasploit framework were zero-day.

Overall, we observed about 2,800 victims worldwide, the most prevalent attack tool being the Havex
Trojan.
We believe this group is highly determined and focused on a very specific industrial sector of vital
interest. It uses a variety of ways to infect its victims and exfiltrate strategic information. The
analyzed data seems to suggest the following points:
•
•
•
•
•

It is not currently possible to determine the Country of origin
The attackers’ global focus is much broader than power producers
Their toolset has remained stable over time
Managed, minimal, methodical approach to sustained operation
Appropriate use of encryption (symmetric key protected with attackers public key for encrypted
log file exfiltration)

This report provides technical details on how the attackers perform their operations.

2. Analysis
This section analyzes all the aspects we could find about how this threat actor manages its
campaigns.
The Crouching Yeti actor performed a massive surveillance operation targeting strategic victims,
many of them in the industrial/manufacturing sector.
There were different ways of delivering of its malware including waterholing, spearphishing and
adding malware to legitimate installers. Once the victims were infected, Crouching Yeti selected
different RATs for its operations. These RATs communicated with Command and Control servers on
compromised servers around the world, using a simple PHP backend.
We were able to identify several victims, including high-profile ones and dozens of domains used in
the campaign.

2.1. Delivery
As far as we know the group behind Crouching Yeti delivers its malware using at least three
different methods.

2.1.1. Legitimate software installers
The first method uses a legitimate software installer repackaged as to contain the malicious DLL.
Such modified self-extracting archives could have been uploaded directly to a compromised server,
replacing the original file, or sent to the victim by email.
One example of using this method was a hijacked SwissRanger camera driver (libMesaSR version
1.0.14.706) that was used to drop the Sysmain backdoor to:
%APPDATA%\sydmain.dll
and set the Run registry value to load malicious DLL upon next system startup.

TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

Figure 1. MESA Camera description
In a similar manner, as early as January 2014, Havex version 038 appears to have been dropped by
a legitimate ~40MB software installer from the eWon web site:
hxxp://www.ewon.biz/software/eCatcher/eCatcherSetup.exe
“eWon” is a Belgian producer of SCADA and industrial network equipment, which helps define this
attack method as a watering hole attack:
“Breaking the barrier between industrial applications and IT standards, the mission of eWON
is to connect industrial machines securely to the Internet, enabling easy remote access and
gathering all types of technical data originating from industrial machines… Connecting
machines across the Internet is our mission.”

Sometimes, the Havex loader was dropped from “eCatcherSetup_v4.exe”, so it seems that the site
operators may have removed a previous file and the attackers replaced it with their Trojanized
installer. It is also likely that the attackers gained access to eWon’s FTP site and replaced the
legitimate file with one that is bound with the Havex dropper several times.

Figure 2. MESA Camera description
Another example that involves a hijacked application from a PLC-related vendor is a Trojanized mbCHECK
installer which replaced the original legitimate version freely downloadable from the vendor’s website.
The vendor - MB Connect Line - is a company which specializes in software for remote maintenance of
PLC systems: MB Connect Line GmbH (hxxp://www.mbconnectline.com/index.php/en/).

TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

Figure 3. MB Connect Line website
In this case, the dropped DLL was Havex version 043.

2.1.2. Malicious XDP file – spear-phishing
The second method relies on a malicious XDP file containing the PDF/SWF exploit (CVE-2011-0611)
and was most likely used in spear-phishing attacks. This exploit drops the Havex loader DLL, which
is stored in an encrypted form in the XDP file.
The exploit is delivered as an XDP (XML Data Package) file which is actually a PDF file
packaged within an XML container. This is a known the PDF obfuscation method and serves as an
additional anti-detection layer.
The XDP file contains a SWF exploit and two files (encrypted with XOR) stored in the invalid section
of the PDF file. One of the files is Havex DLL (version 038), the other is a small JAR file, which is
used to copy and run the DLL by executing the following command:
cmd /c copy <fname_passed_as_param> %TEMP%\\explore.dll /y & rundll32.exe
%TEMP%\\explore.dll,RunDllEntry
TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

The SWF executes the action script, which contains another SWF file which in turn uses the CVE2011-0611 vulnerability to run the shellcode.
The shellcode then looks for a specific signature in the memory (which signs the start of the
encrypted DLL), decrypts and loads it.

2.1.3. Malicious JAR/Html files – waterholing
Finally, this actor actively compromises legitimate websites for watering hole attacks. These hacked
websites in turn redirect victims to malicious JAR or HTML files hosted on other sites maintained
by the group (exploiting CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-1347, and CVE-2012-1723 in Java 6, Java 7,
IE 7 and IE 8). These then drop the Havex loader, the Karagany backdoor and helper tools.
These sites run an exploit kit known as “LightsOut”. It appears that the “LightsOut” exploit kit is
exclusively used by the Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti actor.
From the dozens of Yeti exploit sites we reviewed, the malicious code was nothing more than
slightly modified metasploit java exploits delivering the Havex loader. Some sort of internal
review must have pushed them towards the LightsOut EK. KSN data records help provide a list
of Crouching Yeti related exploit delivery from dozens of these sites.
In earlier cases (July 2013), successful Java exploitation served from nahoonservices.com would
cascade into more Yeti components planted on victim systems. The Java exploit downloaded
Karagany backdoors, which in turn downloaded stealers from 91.203.6.71:

Figure 4. Infection diagram

KSN data recorded at least 20 victim sites that were compromised and injected with Yeti iFrames,
redirecting hundreds of visitors to compromised Yeti exploit sites. Most of these redirector sites
were owned by Western and Eastern European industrial power players, investors, legal advisors
and advocates, and European and US industrial IT equipment makers. The compromised sites
hosting the Lights Out exploit kit were fairly well trafficked, legitimate sites. Their content widely
varies from California winemakers to Cuban travel agencies and Iranian general interest/religious
inspiration sites.

Finally, other second stage tools were simply retrieved by the downloaders over http from various
servers. Some of these Yeti sites, like kinoporno.org, served both Havex and these tools. KSN events
recorded the sites serving Windows Credential Editor and custom credential and document stealing
tools.

2.2. Malware
The Crouching Yeti group has different tools of choice for their operations. This section describes
them from a technical perspective.

2.2.1 The Havex Loader
1. Description
The main functionality of this component is to download and load additional DLL modules into the
memory. These are stored on compromised websites that act as C&C servers. In order to do that, the
malware injects itself into the EXPLORER.EXE process, sends a GET/POST request to the PHP script
on the compromised website, then reads the HTML document returned by the script, looking for a
base64 encrypted data between the two “havex” strings in the comment tag <!--havexhavex-->
and writes this data to a %TEMP%\<tmp>.xmd file (the filename is generated by GetTempFilename
function).
In the meantime, another routine is constantly checking the %TEMP% folder for all *.xmd files. For each
file it finds, it decompresses the content, decrypts (if encrypted) and loads into the memory as the DLL.
In order to run on each system boot, malware copies itself to: <path>\TMPprovider0XX.dll
and creates the autorun registry key.
All samples of this component contain statically linked bzip2 library. Versions >= 01B contain also
a RSAeuro library, used for encryption of log files and decryption of downloadable modules. Public
keys for encryption are hardcoded in the binary and/or stored in the configuration section. In some
cases, these keys are written to the registry values.
In total, we identified 124 different samples of Havex loader, belonging to 27 different versions. As
of June 2014, the latest version number we know of is 044.
2. C&C communication
The URL addresses of the C&C servers (which are indeed compromised websites) are either
hardcoded in the binary, or - in versions => 038 - specified in the configuration section inside the
ICT resource. This resource is compressed with bzip2 and encrypted with XOR.
There are usually 2-4 URLs per binary, different for each malware version and sometimes also
different between samples of the same version.

TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

13
Malware sends a GET request (versions < 017) or POST request to the first available URL. The request
contents depends on the malware version and it may include such information as unique bot id, malware
version number, OS version number, and some other data from configuration, as well as the harvested
information logged into the *.yls file (if any). Then the malware searches the HTML code of each
returned page for havex markers and saves the data between the markers into a temporary file.
3. Downloadable modules - common characteristics
These modules are hosted between the havex markers in the HTML code of compromised websites.
The module code are usually XORed with ”1312312” then compressed with BZIP2 and finally
base64 encoded. Once downloaded into the %TEMP%\*.xmd file by the main Havex DLL, the code
gets decoded, decompressed, saved into the temporary DLL file and loaded into the memory.
The modules perform variety of different actions, including collecting information about the victim’s
system and other machines in the local network, harvesting passwords, listing documents, etc. In order
to do that, some of the modules make use of additional 3rd stage, third-party executables.
Each module contains the configuration information stored in an encrypted and compressed form
inside a resource. Configuration data includes 29-byte UID (unique ID), a 1024 bit RSA Public key
(base64 encoded) and other necessary info (like file paths, etc.). All harvested data is compressed,
encrypted and written into the %TEMP%\*.yls files, which are then sent to the C&C by the main
Havex/Sysmain module.
The “yls” files are encrypted with the 3DES crypto algorithm using a random 192-bit key (168 bit
effective). The 3DES key is encrypted using the public RSA 1024 key and therefore never transferred
in plain text to attackers.
In-depth analysis of the cryptography used by log files is presented in the Appendix 2
4. List of known modules
OPC scanner
This module is designed to collect the detailed data about the OPC servers running in the local
network and save them to to %TEMP%\{rand}.yls file. To query the OPC servers, it uses the
following interfaces:

2.2.2 The Ddex Loader
1. Description
This component is a simple downloader with the functionality similar to the Havex component.
It sends the request to PHP script at the C&C (compromised website) and looks for specific data in
the returned HTML code.
It writes the data (some ASCII string) from between <I6></I6> tags to the file in %TEMP%\
Low\~task.tmp and the data (binary data XORed with 0x0A) from between <B6></B6> tags into
the %TEMP%\Low\~ldXXXX.TMP file.
Then it decrypts the ldXXXX.TMP file and loads it into memory.
Based on the compilation times, we may assume that this loader was used to download and run
modules before it got replaced by Havex.
The Ddex loader is analyzed in more details in Appendix 4.

2.2.3 The Sysmain backdoor
1. Description
This malware can be described as a classical RAT (Remote Access Trojan), since it gives the attacker
a wide range of opportunities to control and to interact with the victims’ machine.
The autonomous part of Sysmain installs and registers itself to be persistent in the system.
Then it gathers general information about the victims system, like
•
•
•
•
•
•

User- and computer names
Locale information
Network- and drive status
Default browsers
Running processes
File listing of the users profile directory.

When ready, this data is submitted to one of the C&C-servers. After that, it checks periodically for
new commands from C&C (pulling via HTTP).

TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

17
With a set of 11 commands, the malware is able to:
•
•
•
•

Execute shell-commands
Launch additional executables or libraries (sent by the attacker)
Collect arbitrary files for later exfiltration
Examine the victim’s filesystem.

There are also commands used for maintenance purposes. Among others, there are commands to
change the pubkey for C&C-communication or delete its traces in the registry.
2. C&C communication
It receives its commands from one of four static command-and-control servers. Every variant of this
malware has its own set of servers.
As usual, the attackers are using most likely compromised webservers as part of their C&Cinfrastructure. To communicate with the C&C-server, the Trojan makes use of asymmetric
encryption with a hardcoded pair of private and public keys.
Another public key is used to encrypt files, which are collected in a local dropzone on the victim’s
file system. The files in that dropzone will be submitted to the attacker later, all in one go.
Appendix 3 provides in-depth analysis of the Sysmain backdoor.

2.2.4 The ClientX backdoor
1. Description
This component is written in .NET and is very similar to The Sysmain backdoor.
The settings of the RAT are stored in the registry as BASE64 encoded values.
The RAT gets its commands by sending a request to a PHP script on the C&C (compromised server)
as usual, and looks for specific data in the returned HTML code. The data in this case is stored
between the havexhavex tags, it is then decrypted and decoded (base64).
The RAT supports 13 commands including:
• Screen capture
• Trojan Update
• Loading DLLs
TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

18
• Starting executables
• Running shell commands
• Listing directories
Each time a command (task) is executed, the result of that command is stored in the registry under
a subkey named “done” or “doneEXT”. The result (which are called “answers” by the authors) is
then posted to the C&C server.
The ClientX backdoor is analyzed in depth in the Appendix 5.

2.2.5 The Karagany Backdoor
1. Description
Karagany is a simple backdoor that connects to the C&C and waits for commands. It can download
and run additional executables, load/delete modules, read file content, reboot the computer, update
itself and remove all components.
Besides backdoor functionality, it also extract credentials from Internet Explorer’s password manager to
the prx.jpg file and injects a small DLL into the processes of web browsers. This DLL keeps listening on
the outgoing network traffic and looking for the basic access authentication details sent over unencrypted
HTTP. Affected browsers include: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla and Opera.
When executed, it copies itself to the folder under %APPDATA% and create a .lnk file in the %STARTUP%
directory. Folder name and filename are chosen from the list of strings hardcoded in the binary:

It also creates C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\ folder, where the information harvested by
downloaded modules will be stored.
After checking if the connection to the Internet is up, it sends the initial POST request to the C&C
server. Known parameters used in C&C communication are:
• &identifiant=<victim_uid>, which is calculated based on system version, system install
date, username and system metrics
• &version=<bot_version_nr>
• &fichier=<file_content>
2. List of known modules:
Screenshot module
This module is used to drop and run the DuckLink CmdCapture tool - a 3rd party freeware AutoIt
application for capturing the screenshots (hxxp://www.ducklink.com/).
A screenshot of the desktop is saved into the C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\scs.jpg file.

Additionally, other system system information - such as day and time of capture, computer name,
username, cpu architecture, os version, IP address, logon domain and logon server, desktop details
(height, width, depth, refresh rate) and environmental variables - are logged in C:\ProgramData\
Mail\MailAg\scs.txt file.
Module listing documents and other files
This module is used to list all files and documents with specified extensions, or which names contain
specified strings, in the C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\fls.txt file.

1. C&C backend
The C&C Backend is written in PHP, consisting of 3 files:
• “log.php” is a Web-Shell, used for file level operations.
• “testlog.php” is not a PHP-script but it contains the C&C Server logfile of backdoor-connections.
Please see “source.php” below for further information.
• “source.php”
The Backdoors interact with “source.php”, which is the control script. These are its functions on execution:

4. If the bot executes an HTTP-POST-request, the transferred data is written to the file “<botID>.
ans”, enclosed in “xdata”-Tag with timestamp. (“ans” is the acronym for “Answer”).
5. Checks for any file “<botID>_*.txt”
a. If found the first step is to append the timestamp, filename and a “sent” Status indicated to
“<botID>.log”. Then the file content is transferred to the bot, embedded into HTML with
HTML-Body “No data!” and HTML-Comment “havex” containing the data to be transferred.
Finally the file on the server is removed. If this removal fails it is logged to “<botID>.log”.
b. If no matching file is found, a HTML-Response is sent with an empty “havex” HTMLComment and HTML-Body text “Sorry, no data corresponding your request.”

2.3.1. Victims
The term “victim” in this section refers to a botID (unique String of the Backdoor), connecting to
one or more C&C Servers. Based on the 45 C&C Servers we monitored, a total of 2,811 unique
Victims were discovered.

TLP: Green

For any inquire please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

The average number of victims per C&C is 70:

The following chart depicts the first (red line) and last (blue line) appearance of each victim on the C&C.
The “FirstHit” shows how the rate of accumulating new victims has accelerated over the course of
2014. “LastHit” shows how the last connection of victims to C&C servers also increases over time.
This could mean victims are disinfecting their computers, or it may be that they simply report to a
different C&C server that we do not monitor.

Mapping unique hits of victims per day also indicates a decrease of “active” infections. The following
chart clearly shows a difference between weekdays (groups of five higher bars) and weekends (two
lower bars). The daily unique hit-rate fell by about half from around 800 connections at the beginning of
2014 to around 400 connections per week-day by the middle of the year:

Besides the Havex version, also the OS-Version of the victim computer is also communicated to the
C&C server. The most common Operating System among victims is Windows XP, but Windows 8.1 is
also in the list.

2.3.2. Victims-C&C relationship
Based on the analysis of the monitored C&C servers we identify some clusters depending on
malware versions and the victims.
This graph visualizes these relations. Every dot represents a victim, different backdoors and versions
are colored differently. The C&C servers are also represented as dot where several clients connect.
Grey lines are connections from a victim to its C&C Server.

Figure 17. Clusters of victim-C&C relationships
Some C&C servers are dedicated to a given version of a backdoor (big Cluster). Others share
connections with different backdoor versions and different backdoors.
Breaking this down to the sectors of the identified victims, we cannot see any correlation between
C&Cs and victims. The same sectors are targeted with different backdoor versions.

3. Attribution
3.1. Non-specific Data
Compared to our other APT research the available data is more non-specific than usual. There
simply is no one piece or set of data that would lead to the conclusion that the threat actor is Bear,
Kitten, Panda, Salmon, or otherwise. Significant data points below.
File timestamp analysis and unique strings
It is rare to see file timestamps used as a precise, primary source of information when it comes to
threat actor attribution. In previous reports, these timestamps are used as supporting, or secondary
pieces of data. They may help to suggest or support a time range of attacker activity, but they are
very easily modified. So it is not very helpful to focus on this data set.
The strings present in the backdoors, web components, and exploits are English. Almost 200 malicious
binaries and the related operational content all present a complete lack of Cyrillic content, the opposite
of our documented findings from researching Red October, Miniduke, Cosmicduke, Snake, and
TeamSpy.
The OPC module strings include typos and bad grammar. Some are so bad they are almost silly, and
there doesn’t seem to be a consistent pattern here:
Programm was started at %02i:%02i:%02i
Start finging of LAN hosts...
Finding was fault. Unexpective error
Was found %i hosts in LAN:
Hosts was’t found.
There are also three interesting strings inside the Karagany backdoor:
identifiant (which is French for identifier), fichier (French for file) and liteliteliteskot
(lite scot is Swedish for little sheet)

Timestamp details
Timestamp analysis is based on the total number of 154 collected binaries:
•
•
•
•
•
•

124 samples of Havex loader (versions 01 - 044) + 7 downloaded modules
7 samples of Sysmain backdoor
4 samples of Ddex loader
1 sample of ClientX backdoor
4 samples of Karagany Trojan + 2 downloaded modules
3 samples of Trojanized installers

Highlights:
• The earliest samples related to this campaign are the Ddex loader binaries with compilation
timestamps between October and November 2010.
• The first Havex loader samples are the version 01 and version 02 samples with compilation
timestamps from 28th September 2011.
• The latest known samples are Havex loader version 044, compiled on 7th May 2014 and all OPC
modules compiled in April and May 2014.
• Most of samples were compiled during the weekdays, although there is a couple of samples with
the compilation timestamp indicating Saturday
• Most of samples were compiled between 6:00 and 16:00 UTC with the peak between 6:00 and
8:00 UTC.

3.2. Exploit server activity
All the exploit servers delivered slightly modified ripped content from open source repositories. All
the servers appear to be hacked servers. According to the available data, no zero-day exploits were
used in any of these attacks, either to compromise the servers in the first place, or delivered as client
side attack exploits by the Lights Out Exploit Kit.
While this purely malicious re-use of metasploit PoC highlights the danger that these attack tools
pose, it is also unusual to see an exclusively metasploit attack toolset effectively used in this way,
delivered from what appear to be a chain of higher value compromised sites.
All of these compromised web applications were vulnerable to freely available offensive security
tools. We acknowledge that many of the compromised referrer servers were related to industrial
power producers in some way. However, these targets almost seem an afterthought, as the exploit
servers themselves were compromised web servers from Cuban travel agency sites, a Californian
winery site, a US based women’s fashion site, an Iranian general interest/religious inspiration site,
a number of dating and adult content websites, and a variety of others. Although, we note that
the known Trojanized software packages were ICS/SCADA related as well, possibly because those
victim sets or environments required special attention. So, while there was a strong set of offensive
activities on power producers during the campaigns, it was by no means the full focus of them.

3.3. Victim characteristics and categories
While it may be “shocking” to observe industrial power producers around the world targeted by
any one threat actor, this actor’s attack activity does not appear to be constrained to this sector.
The related industries of interest show a much broader global scope than previously discussed, and
the geographic regions of interest have gone completely undiscussed. For example, Spain had the
highest number of victims. However, it appears that there was no significant correlation between the
victim location and the C&C geolocation. According to our data, the list rounds out with the victim
organizations fitting the following additional categories:
•

Health

4. Conclusions
The Crouching Yeti actor has been performing massive surveillance campaigns over the last few
years, at least since 2010. Their targets included thousands of victims of which we were able to
identify a few, confirming Crouching Yeti’s interest in several strategic sectors.
The distribution strategy of the group focuses on methods following this targeted philosophy,
including spear-phishing and waterholing. Noticeably, they also compromised legitimate software
packages from strategic actors in the SCADA sector in order to infect their final victims. The victim
list confirms that the tactic proved successful.
There is nothing especially sophisticated in the exploits used, or in the malware used to infect
victims. The RATs are flexible enough to perform surveillance and data exfiltration efficiently. The
attackers used dozens of compromised servers as C&C domains with a simple, but effective, PHP
backend.
However, there is an interesting connection with this group and the LightsOut exploit kit for the
distribution of its malware in some waterholing attacks. We believe they are likely its only operators
as of June 2014.
Thanks to the monitoring of several of the C&C domains used by the group, we were able to
identify several victims. This victim list reinforces the interests shown by the Crouching Yeti actor in
strategic targets, but also shows the interest of the group in many other not-so-obvious institutions.
We believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be fair to redefine the Crouching Yeti
actor not only as a highly targeted one in a very specific area of interest, but a broad surveillance
campaign with interests in different sectors.
We will continue to monitor this threat actor.
