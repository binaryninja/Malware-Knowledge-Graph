New Evidence Supports Assessment that DarkSide Likely
Responsible for Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack;
Others Targeted

Executive summary
On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline issued a statement that, due to a cyber-attack, they had
partially shut down operations of their pipeline that supplies almost 50% of gasoline to the
eastern United States. The press later confirmed that the attack included ransomware. The
FBI stated on May 10, 2021, that the DarkSide ransomware group -- also known as Carbon
Spider -- was responsible for the attack.
SecurityScorecard conducted an analysis of the attack analyzing NetFlow data (data
associated with data transfers on the Internet) and determined that a large amount of data
was exfiltrated from Colonial Pipeline networks to IP addresses also associated with other
ransomware attacks for which Carbon Spider has previously taken responsibility. Through
this analysis, combined with identifying and deconstructing associated malware and
correlation with other known victims, SecurityScorecard can confirm with moderate
confidence that DarkSide also known as Carbon Spider was responsible for the Colonial
Pipeline attack and potentially other ransomware attacks.

Key findings
1/9

Through an ongoing investigation, SecurityScorecard has found with a moderate
confidence level that the DarkSide ransomware group, also known as Carbon Spider,
transferred data from Colonial Pipeline on May 6, 2021, to an external IP address, one
day prior to public reports.
Through SecurityScorecard’s analysis, we have identified other organizations that
Carbon Spider has already claimed to have attacked as well as others that have not
been previously identified.
SecurityScorecard’s research indicates that Carbon Spider exfiltrated data from the
Colonial Pipeline network likely for use in an extortion attempt, just as we see with
many other ransomware groups.
SecurityScorecard did not find any evidence of direct disruption of the critical
infrastructure owned and operated by Colonial Pipeline. However, it is plausible that
Carbon Spider caused damage to other parts of the Colonial Pipeline network.
DarkSide ransomware is designed to encrypt files that are often irreversible without a
decrypter from the authors.
SecurityScorecard observed that this group has been operating since August 2020
through dark web leak postings.
The attribution analysis was made based on publicly available data in both clearweb
and open access to dark web sources.

Background
The DarkSide ransomware group, also known as Carbon Spider, is suspected to have
breached Colonial Pipeline (Colonial). Carbon Spider is a Russian criminal group focused on
developing and using DarkSide ransomware. This group follows a traditional Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) like pattern of intrusion (i.e. gain access to a network through a
known vulnerability, perform reconnaissance within the network and identify targeted data for
encryption/exfiltration) that we have seen in other targeted attacks. The following is an
intelligence assessment from SecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team.

Investigation
Reviewing the techniques, tactics, and procedures used by this attacker, the threat actor
utilized Cobalt Strike amongst many other tools. Cobalt Strike is a tool frequently used by
Russian APTs and criminal groups involved in the distribution of ransomware. The Cobalt
Framework is considered a file-less implant (residing in memory) of the infected victim and
allows for the attacker to introduce additional malware.
SecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team focused on understanding the actor's
capability and intent. SecurityScorecard found that over 80GB of data was transferred from
the Colonial Pipeline network to an external IP address. Based on our observations the actor
exfiltrated data from the victim’s network likely in an extortion attempt, like many other
ransomware groups.
2/9

SecurityScorecard did not observe any evidence of direct disruption of the critical
infrastructure owned and operated by Colonial that resulted in the shutdown of the pipeline.
However, it is plausible that DarkSide caused damage to systems in parts of their network,
as DarkSide is designed to encrypt files on disk which are often unrecoverable without a
decrypter from the authors.
Additionally, using NetFlow analysis, the Investigations & Analysis team observed details
around data exfiltration to understand connections made between the victim’s network and
the adversary’s infrastructure. NetFlow data is similar to call detail records which record time,
duration, routing details between phones, but not the content of the conversation. NetFlow
data shows which IP addresses were connected, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
port that was used, and the number of packets and bytes that were transmitted. This is a key
element of SecurityScorecard’s investigation as it provides critical insight into victimology and
enables us to link it back to Carbon Spider. NetFlow, like call detail records, does not include
content of the transmission so we were unable to view the data exfiltrated. However, we can
assume the data will be used to extort the victim. It is possible that sensitive data stolen from
Colonial could make its way to Carbon Spider’s leak site if the company does not pay.

Malicious infrastructure
Using SecurityScorecard’s in-house analysis methods, we were able to extract several
configuration files relating to Cobalt Strike that provided additional insight into the
adversaries’ infrastructure. In any incident response investigation, understanding the
infrastructure used by the threat actor will enable the discovery of additional indicators of
compromise (IOC). Upon infecting victims a ransomware note is left on the victim’s PC with
instructions for payment.

Malicious C2 server
The FBI reported on May 10, 2021, that IP address 159.65.225.72 is affiliated with the
DarkSide ransomware group as a data exfiltration destination. The address is hosted in
DigitalOcean, an American cloud provider, in AS14061 within their NYC region. As of the last

5/9

SecurityScorecard scan on May 5, 2021, the only service running on the C2 IP was SSH
(port 22). Our NetFlow analysis demonstrates that SSH was used as the data exfiltration
method.

Data exfiltration
SecurityScorecard can confirm reports in both media and by the FBI that the adversary was
present in the Colonial Pipeline environment. We were able to identify a connection between
the Colonial Pipeline network and a malicious asset associated with Carbon Spider.
The Investigations & Analysis team identified a connection between the victim’s IP
(198.154.26.212) and IP address 159.65.225.72, as mentioned above to be associated with
the DarkSide ransomware group by the FBI. Our investigation confirmed the connection by
cross-referencing the IPs with NetFlow data from our datasets. Based on our analysis at
least 80GB+ of data was exfiltrated from Colonial and sent to the adversary between GMT:
Thursday, 6 May 2021 10:31:22 and GMT: Thursday, 6 May 2021 12:22:20.

Victimology
Beyond Colonial Pipeline, there are additional suspected victims of DarkSide ransomware
that SecurityScorecard has identified based on NetFlow analysis.

The attacker utilized the server in DigitalOcean to exfiltrate data from a number of entities,
including Colonial Pipeline. Some of these addresses correlate with victims found on the

threat actor’s own leak site, but others have not previously been identified as victims.

To find potential victims, SecurityScorecard collected the unique IP addresses that
communicated with the data exfiltration IP address on port 22 and had more than 1000
packets in the past three months. Some IP addresses communicated with the data
exfiltration server for an unusually long period of time compared to Colonial, where the data
was exfiltrated in 2 hours. We suspect those IP addresses may have been used by the
attackers reviewing and downloading the data exfiltrated from victims’ networks. We have
also observed many IP addresses that have very few flows, which might suggest attackers
could have used proxies to connect to the data exfiltration servers.

Attribution
Attribution is often difficult and requires much analysis to attribute any cyber-attack to a
specific group with any degree of certainty. SecurityScorecard concludes, because of the
Analysis of Competing Hypotheses below, that the most likely scenario is that Carbon Spider
conducted the attack. Our analysis supports the hypothesis, based on the correlation of
NetFlow data with reported victims in the Carbon Spider’s leak site, that the Colonial Pipeline
attack was conducted by this adversary.
SecurityScorecard can also confirm the Colonial Pipeline attack involves DarkSide
ransomware and not another family of malware.

Analysis of completing hypothesis (in progress)
In intelligence analysis, we use a model known as the analysis of competing hypotheses.
This is a model designed to rank evidence against multiple hypotheses; in this case, we had
several likely scenarios connected with this incident.
