Threat analysts have observed a new wave of attacks installing Cobalt Strike beacons on
vulnerable Microsoft SQL Servers, leading to deeper infiltration and subsequent malware
infections.
MS-SQL Server is a popular database management system powering large internet
applications to small single-system applets.
However, many of these deployments aren't adequately secured as they are publicly
exposed to the Internet with weak passwords, and according to a report by Ahn Lab's ASEC,
an unknown threat actor is taking advantage of this.

Targeting MS-SQL with Cobalt Strike
The attacks start with threat actors scanning for servers with an open TCP port 1433, which
are likely public-facing MS-SQL servers. The attacker then carries out brute-forcing and
dictionary attacks to crack the password. For the attack to work with either method, the target
password has to be weak.
Once the attacker gains access to the admin account and logs into the server, the ASEC
researchers have seen them drop coin-miners such as Lemon Duck, KingMiner, and Vollgar.
Additionally, the threat actor backdoors the server with Cobalt Strike to establish persistence
and perform lateral movement.
Cobalt Strike is downloaded via a command shell process (cmd.exe and powershell.exe)
onto the compromised MS-SQL and is injected and executed in MSBuild.exe to evade
detection.

Processes that download Cobalt Strike (ASEC)
After execution, a beacon is injected into the legitimate Windows wwanmm.dll process and
waits for the attacker's commands while staying hidden inside a system library file.
"As the beacon that receives the attackerâ€™s command and performs the malicious behavior
does not exist in a suspicious memory area and instead operates in the normal module
wwanmm.dll, it can bypass memory-based detection," explains the report by Ahn Lab's
ASEC group.

Code and strings used for tainting the dll (ASEC)
Cobalt Strike is a commercial pen-testing (offensive security) tool that is extensively abused
by cybercriminals who find its powerful features set particularly useful for their malicious
operations.
The $3,500 per license tool was meant to help ethical hackers and red teams simulate real
attacks against organizations that want to boost their security stance, but from the moment
cracked versions were leaked, its use by threat actors went out of control.
It's now used by Squirrelwaffle, Emotet, malware operators, opportunistic attacks, Linuxtargeting groups, sophisticated adversaries, and commonly by ransomware gangs when
conducting attacks.
The reason why threat actors abuse it so much is its rich functionality which includes the
following:

Command execution
Keylogging
File operations
SOCKS proxying
Privilege escalation
Mimikatz (credential-stealing)
Port scanning
Moreover, the Cobalt Strike agent called the "beacon" is file-less shellcode, so the chances
of it being detected by security tools are decreased, especially in poorly managed systems.
AhnLab's data shows that all the download URLs and C2 server URLs that supported the
recent attack wave point to the same attacker.
To protect your MS-SQL server from attacks of this type, use a strong admin password,
place the server behind a firewall, log everything and monitor suspicious actions, apply
available security updates, and use a data access controller to inspect and enforce policies
on every transaction.
