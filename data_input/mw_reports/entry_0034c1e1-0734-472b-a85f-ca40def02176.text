Nightmare on Tor Street: Ursnif variant Dreambot adds Tor functionality

Introduction
One of the most active banking Trojans that we have observed recently in email and exploit kits is one often referred to as Ursnif or Gozi ISFB
[6]. Thanks to Frank Ruiz from FoxIT InTELL, we know that the actor developing one of its variants since 2014 has named this variant
Dreambot. The Dreambot malware is actively evolving, and recent samples in particular caught our attention for their addition of Tor
communication capability, as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality. Dreambot is currently spreading via numerous exploit kits as well as
through email attachments and links.
It should be noted that while Dreambot is one of the most active and prevalent Ursnif variants, there are other active forks including “IAP” [5].
The Gozi ISFB source has been leaked, making way for additional development efforts.
Analysis
The Dreambot malware is still in active development and over the last few months we have seen multiple versions of it spreading in the wild.
The Tor-enabled version of Dreambot has been active since at least July 2016, when we first observed the malware successfully download the
Tor client and connect to the Tor network. Today, many Dreambot samples include this functionality, but few use it as their primary mode of
communication with their command and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in the future this feature may be utilized much more frequently,
creating additional problems for defenders.
For this analysis, we looked at version 2.14.845, which has a configuration that differs from the others Dreambot versions in that the domain
generation algorithm (DGA) is not used: therefore, the DGA variables and parameters are missing. The following is an example of decrypted
configuration data with sections of interest highlighted in red.

Figure 1: Decrypted configuration data used by Dreambot
There are three types of URLs present in the decrypted configuration. The first type of URL listed in the configuration data is used for the plain
HTTP (that is, non-Tor) communication with C&C servers. The bot reports to the C&C server using the typical request pattern: for example, the
initial checkin to the C&C server is in the form of: cfg_url + “/images/” + encoded_data + (.jpeg|.gif|.bmp).
The second type of URL that appears in the configuration data (highlighted in red box in Fig. 1) are the .onion C&C addresses. They are the
default choice for the bot and work in the same way the plain HTTP C&C’s do, except that all communication is encrypted and tunneled over
Tor.
The third set of URLs is used to download the Tor client. We believe the client is decrypted using the configuration serpent key [7]. When the
Tor client is retrieved, the bot creates a registry key named “TorClient” in the registry subfolder to store its data. This subfolder is located in
HKCU\\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\{random guid}. This key contains the path to the client, which is dropped in the %TMP%
folder, with a filename using the pattern [A-F0-9]{4}.bin.

Figure 2: TorClient registry key
The registry key value is easy to decrypt, as the XOR-based algorithm [8] is reused in much of the code (e.g., for decryption of the strings in
the .bss section). The 4-byte key is generated at runtime based on the TOKEN_USER value XORed with 0xE8FA7DD7.
For the two types of POST HTTP requests (Tor and non-Tor), the configuration includes a check of the Tor flag (here at eax+10). If this flag is
set, Dreambot sends both the C&C checkins and the data upload requests using Tor.

Figure 3: Configuration flags for communicating via Tor
In addition to the Dreambot with Tor functionality, we have observed a P2P-enabled versions (e.g. version 2.15.798) that has been around
considerably longer. Spread alongside the other variants this version utilizes the usual DGA or hard-coded addresses as well as what appears
to be a peer-to-peer protocol to communicate. This functionality needs an additional IP in the configuration that delivers the nodes list. This
protocol operates over TCP and UDP and uses a custom packet format. Due to the addition of this functionality, the client code surface is
almost twice as big as that of the Tor version. We are still investigating the functionality and will not go into deeper detail at this time.
Exploit Kit Campaigns
One early interesting example of Dreambot delivery came from an instance of the Niteris exploit kit. Several months after that, we spotted the
same redirection chain but instead to an undocumented 2-step flash Nuclear Pack. This particular Nuclear Pack behaved similarly to Spartan
EK from the same coder in which an initial flash payload acted as a filter before sending the exploit and payload to end users. GooNky and
AdGholas actors also commonly used Angler EK to deliver Dreambot while Angler was still highly active. Figures 4-7 show these infection
chains.

Figure 8 shows Dreambot delivery in a Japan-focused malvertising campaign using Neutrino EK while Figure 9 shows a recent sample of
Dreambot as a secondary payload via the ElTest and the Smokebot Trojan. In the latter example, we can see this instance of Dreambot is
using Tor to connect to C&C infrastructure.

Email Campaigns
Dreambot has been actively distributed via email in 2016. We have noted campaigns targeting various regions including Australia, Italy,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Poland, and Canada. These campaigns have ranged from thousands to hundreds of thousands
of malicious email messages. We show few examples of these campaigns using links or document attachments leading to the installation of

Dreambot.
In the first example, the actor used a lure claiming the recipient had been subpoenaed by the Federal Court of Australia. If the user were to
follow the link they would be greeted by a web page purporting to be the official court site. If the user then followed the instructions, they would
be led to a download of a zipped JavaScript file that, when executed, led to a Dreambot download.

In the next example, users in Australia were targeted with an email pretending be associated with Microsoft and Office365. The link in the
email led directly to a zipped JavaScript downloader hosted on Microsoft Sharepoint; opening the file would install DreamBot. (Proofpoint
researchers notified Microsoft about the hosted malware).

In the following example, users in the United States received messages with attachments purporting to contain a record of a payment. The
Microsoft Word document attachment contained malicious macros that, if enabled, downloaded Dreambot.

In the next campaign, users in Switzerland received personalized messages in German containing their name and company name, claiming to
attach an invoice for an order. The Microsoft Word attachment contained macros that, if enabled, would download Dreambot.

their purchases. The Microsoft Word attachments contained macros that, if enabled, would download Dreambot.

Conclusion
Dreambot is one of the most active banking Trojans we have seen recently, with distribution vectors across a variety of exploit kits and both
malicious document attachment and URL-based email campaigns. Often referred to as Ursnif and Gozi ISFB, Dreambot is being distributed in
countries around the world and is under active development. In particular, we have observed samples with C&C communications enabled over
both Tor and P2P. For Tor-enabled versions in particular, Dreambot activity on infected machines can be especially hard to detect at the
network level, creating new challenges for defenders and IT organizations alike.
We will continue to monitor Dreambot and its growing list of capabilities as the banking Trojan landscape evolves.
