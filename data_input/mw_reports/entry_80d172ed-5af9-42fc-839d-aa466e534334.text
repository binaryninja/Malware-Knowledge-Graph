Forensics Analysis of the NSO Group’s Pegasus Spyware

January 12, 2022

NSO’s Group Pegasus spyware was mentioned multiple times during 2021 in the media. It
has been heavily analyzed by organizations such as Amnesty International [1] and the
University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab [2] [3] [4] [5].
The targets included journalists from Azerbaijan, France, Hungary, India, French human
rights lawyers, French human rights activists, Rwandan activists, and Indian human rights
activists. Citizen Lab also identified Bahraini activists, New York Times Journalist Ben
Hubbard, and Palestinian human rights defenders as victims.
The Pegasus spyware has been distributed via one-click attacks (the target needs to click on
a malicious link received via SMS messages, WhatsApp, etc.) and zero-click attacks (no
interaction needed). Some of the recently used 0-day exploits developed by NSO Group
include KISMET and FORCEDENTRY (also called Megalodon). It’s important to mention that
Apple patched all the vulnerabilities submitted regarding these attacks, and it’s crucial to
update your iOS devices regularly.

The FORCEDENTRY exploit has been analyzed by Google [6] and TrendMicro [7]. It has
been attributed a CVE identifier of CVE-2021-30860 and represents a vulnerability in the
CoreGraphics PDF parser. It is an integer overflow vulnerability which leads to out-of-bounds
write. The crashing point inside the function JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg is displayed
below:

The Google Project Zero team performed a deep dive into the exploit and explained that the
attackers could define a small computer architecture with registers and a 64-bit adder and
comparator. It is computationally equivalent to JavaScript, and the team concluded that this
is one of the most technically sophisticated exploits they’ve ever analyzed.
LIFARS team analyzed a suspected infection with Pegasus using the Mobile Verification
Toolkit released by the Amnesty International Security Lab [8]. We’ve also used the NSO
Group Pegasus IOCs (domains, iCloud accounts, files, process names) in our investigation
[9].
We were able to identify six Pegasus processes that ran on the victim’s iPhone. The infection
occurred on February 1st, which coincided with when the NSO group deployed the
FORCEDENTRY iMessage Zero-Click mentioned by the CitizenLab in their report [3].

The file
“/private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist” used
by Amnesty International’s Security Lab to extract the suspicious iMessage account lookups
is missing in our case. The netusage.sqlite SQLite database is also missing, and we couldn’t
extract records from the Cache.db databases because we couldn’t jailbreak the device.
The Pegasus spyware remains an active threat even if the NSO Group has been sanctioned
by the United States. We recommend rebooting your iPhone daily in order to remove nonpersistent malware.
