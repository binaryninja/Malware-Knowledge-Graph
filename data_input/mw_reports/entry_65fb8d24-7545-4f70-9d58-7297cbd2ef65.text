Malware Campaign Targeting Jaxx Cryptocurrency Wallet Users Shut
Down
A website spoofing the official Jaxx cryptocurrency wallet site has been taken down after
analysts at Flashpoint discovered a number of infections linked to the operation.
A website spoofing the official Jaxx cryptocurrency wallet site has been taken down after
analysts at Flashpoint discovered a number of infections linked to the operation.
The phony site had a similar URL to the legitimate jaxx[.]io site and was serving a number of
custom and commodity strains of malware with the end goal of emptying Jaxx users’ wallets.
Jaxx is a popular cryptocurrency wallet that has been downloaded more than 1.2 million
times on desktop and mobile platforms, according to a blog published on the Jaxx site in
March. Jaxx Liberty, the latest version of the wallet, supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more
than a dozen other cryptocurrencies.

Flashpoint analysts earlier this month notified Jaxx support teams as well as the Cloudflare
content delivery network. Cloudflare took steps to suspend services to the spoofed site,
which was a line-by-line copy of the actual Jaxx site that included modifications made to the
download links, redirecting those to an attacker-controlled server.
It should be noted that this is primarily a social engineering attack and does not involve a
vulnerability in the Jaxx application, website, or other domains owned by Decentral, a
Canadian blockchain startup, that provides Jaxx.
It’s unclear how the attackers were luring victims to the spoofed Jaxx site, whether they were
relying on poisoned search engine results, phishing via email or chat applications, or other
means to infect victims.

Focus on Windows, Mac Desktop Users
The start date for this campaign figures to be Aug. 19 when the fraudulent domain was
created. The attackers were targeting Windows and Mac OS X users with a variety of
malware developed for the desktop platforms. Anyone who clicked on the mobile downloads
were redirected to the legitimate Jaxx website.
Visitors to the fraudulent website, below, would likely believe they were on the legitimate
Jaxx page since the attackers went to the trouble of installing the legitimate wallet software
onto victims’ computers while malware silently installed in the background.

Visitors clicking on the fraudulent links for the Mac OS X software were presented with a
custom-built malicious Java Archive (JAR) file. The fraudulent Windows software link
downloaded a custom-written .NET application, which contained not only malicious behavior
(such as exfiltrating all of the victim’s desktop files to a command-and-control [C2] server),
but also downloaded , KPOT Stealer and Clipper, both of which are marketed on
underground Russian-language cybercrime sites.
The Mac OS JAR file is programmed in PHP and compiled using a Russian language IDE
called DevelNext. The Jaxx branding throughout the code indicates the malware was
developed solely for this campaign.
Victims executing the JAR see a message in Russian and English: “Temporarily due to
technical problems on the server, you cannot create a new wallet.” Victims are then routed to
the “PAIR / RESTORE WALLET” screen which prompts them for their Jaxx wallet backup
phrase — a password used to decrypt wallets in order for the attackers to exfiltrate the digital
currency from the victim’s account. The backup phrase is then exfiltrated to the attacker’s
web server while the victim receives another mixed Russian and English-language error
message that states, “Server is not available. Try again in 4 hours,” below.

Victims on Windows who execute the malicious link download a Zip archive called
LibertyBeta-setup-2.0.9.zip from a Google Docs URL. Like the Mac OS X JAR, the malicious
.NET binary was likely created specifically for this campaign. The malware reaches out to the
command-and-control server where all of the local .txt, .doc, and .xls files are uploaded. The
phony application then downloads three executables from hardcoded URLs: the official
Liberty Beta installer, and KPOT, which steals information from the local hard drive, as well
as Clipper, which monitors the clipboard for digital wallet addresses; once an address is
found, it is swapped out for a wallet address controlled by the attacker. By changing these
addresses in the clipboard, victims may not notice the modified recipient after copying and
pasting these long alphanumeric addresses while sending payments.

Assessment
This malware campaign indicates that cybercriminals may go to great lengths to socially
engineer an organization’s customers into installing malware to ultimately steal digital
currency. It’s likely cybercriminals will continue to leverage commodity malware kits offered
for sale in underground hacking forums to steal credentials and/or digital currency from
victims.
