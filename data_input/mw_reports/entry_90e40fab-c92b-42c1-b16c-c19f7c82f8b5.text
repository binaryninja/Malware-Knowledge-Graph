Introduction
Much has been written in recent years about point-of-sale (PoS) data breaches, most
notably attacks against Target in late 2013, Home Depot in mid to late 2014, Wendy’s in
early 2016 and most recently Arby’s in January of this year. Generally, malware used in PoS
attacks is designed to identify payment card data residing in memory, then exfiltrate that
data to an off-site, attacker controlled server.

Background
According to a 2016 report published by the Federal Reserve, non-cash payments
increased in 2016 to an estimated total value of $178 trillion, with an estimated total noncash payments increase of 5.3 percent per year since 2012. Given these statistics, it is not
surprising to learn that there exists a thriving market for stolen payment card information on
the dark web.
In a 2015 study, BitGlass discovered that fake financial information they generated and
tracked was viewed almost 1,100 times from 22 different countries. Recent reports released
by Arbor Networks and Flashpoint mentioned a recent campaign involving PoS malware
called Flokibot that has recently targeted endpoints in Brazil, specifically those with

Portuguese language versions of Windows 7 installed. Both reports have excellent
breakdowns of the files and attack chain analysis which will not be repeated here.

Testing RAM Scraping Protection
CylancePROTECT® actively blocks RAM scraping techniques used by this type of PoS
threat, so the Cylance Threat Guidance Team set out to discover how CylancePROTECT
would react to Flokibot in a test environment.
First, a brief introduction to what kind of data is encoded on a credit or debit card. The
magnetic stripe on the back of a financial payment card contains three “tracks” of data:
Track 1, Track 2 and Track 3 (which is rarely used). Track 1 contains, among other things,
the account holder's name, account number, expiration date and CVV number. Track 2
contains much of the same information, except for the account holder's name and some of
the other checks, and is ultimately less data over all, while still possessing enough data to
generate a fake payment card. This makes the information contained on Track 2 a prime
target for attackers. The format of the information contained within Track 2 is illustrated
below:

We located a recent sample of Flokibot and copied it into a test environment with
CylancePROTECT v1400 installed and online, where it was quarantined pre-execution:

Then, we took CylancePROTECT offline and again discovered the same results: the file
was quarantined pre-execution, seen below:

It was at this point that we got curious to see what would happen if we removed every
protection within CylancePROTECT’s arsenal except for Memory Defense. So, we created
a test environment with Portuguese language version of 32-bit Windows 7 Professional with
CylancePROTECT installed.
There are several websites that allow a user to generate credit card numbers that adhere to
the Luhn Algorithm, a checksum formula that is used to validate, among other things, credit
and debit card numbers. The team leveraged one of these sites to generate fake credit card
numbers for testing:
VISA

MASTERCARD

4556920012834452

5341701240865907

4929028434080223

5301666338130225

4532321332286920

5414957219825866

4916294386558609

5181854712024975

These numbers were used to generate strings that adhered to the formatting structure of
the information contained on Track 2, an example is shown below:
;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=yymm1200123400000000?*
Where ‘x’ represents the 16-digit account number and ‘yymm’ represents the card's
expiration date, as year and month.
When the file is executed, it injects explorer.exe and as a result, any credit card number that
lies within the memory space of that process should be susceptible to memory scraping by
Flokibot. This means that we should be able to generate a string that adheres to the
formatting above and enter it into an open Notepad document, then execute the file. The
RAM scraping protection built into CylancePROTECT will recognize Track 2 data in memory
and trigger an alert.
We disabled all protections in our test environment, except for Memory Defense. The preexecution setup of the test is shown below (again, note that we are using the Portuguese
language version of 32-bit Windows 7 Professional):

8/12

Figure 4. Pre-execution Setup
At this point, we executed the file. With the properly formatted Track 2 data in memory, we
will expect to see the RAM scraping protection trigger an alert when the malware is
executed, which is exactly what happens. In the screenshot below, the alert (Violation:
TrackDataRead) can be seen:

Conclusion
This demonstration shows that not only did CylancePROTECT quarantine the threat in both
online and offline modes, the RAM scraping protection built within the Memory Defense
protection is effective in mitigating Flokibot point of sale malware attacks by recognizing
Track 2 payment card data residing in memory. It is important for end users to enable
Memory Defense on their endpoints to aid in defending against PoS memory scraping
attacks.
If you use our endpoint protection product, CylancePROTECT, you were already protected
from this attack. If you don't have CylancePROTECT, contact us to learn how our AI based
solution can predict and prevent unknown and emerging threats.
