CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE

E X ECU T I V E SUMM A RY
Cyber risk to the manufacturing sector is increasing,
led by disruptive cyberattacks impacting industrial
processes, intrusions enabling information gathering
and process information theft, and new activity from
Industrial Control Systems (ICS)-targeting adversaries.
Dragos currently publicly tracks five ICS-focused
activity groups targeting manufacturing: CHRYSENE,
PARISITE, MAGNALLIUM, WASSONITE, and XENOTIME
in addition to various ransomware activities capable of
disrupting operations.

Manufacturing relies on ICS to scale, function, and ensure consistent quality
control and product safety. The sector produces crucial materials, finished goods,
and medicine and is classified as critical infrastructure. Due to the interconnected
nature of facilities and operations, an attack on a manufacturing entity can have
ripple effects across the supply chain that relies on timely and precise production
to support product fulfillment, health and safety, and national security objectives.
Ransomware adversaries are adopting ICS-aware functionality with the ability
to stop industrial related processes and cause disruptive – and potentially
destructive – impacts. Dragos has not observed ICS-specific malware targeting
manufacturing operations on the same scale or sophistication as that used in
the disruptive TRISIS1 and CRASHOVERRIDE2 malware attacks that targeted
energy operations in Saudi Arabia and Ukraine, respectively. However, known
and ongoing threats to manufacturing can have direct and indirect impact to
operations. This report provides a snapshot of the threat landscape as of October
2020 and is expected to change in the future as adversaries and their behaviors
evolve.

KEY FINDINGS
• Ransomware with the ability to disrupt industrial processes is the biggest
threat to manufacturing operations. Adversaries are increasingly
adopting ICS-aware mechanisms within ransomware that could stop
operations.
• Dragos publicly tracks five activity groups that target manufacturing.
• Disruptions within manufacturing industrial processes have supply
chain implications that impact businesses and potentially operations
elsewhere.
• The theft of proprietary and confidential manufacturing process
details – often considered intellectual property – remains a high risk for
manufacturers.
• A growing convergence of interconnected enterprise, operations, and
process control networks contributes to a growing threat landscape.

PARISITE, operating since 2017, targets
manufacturing, electric utilities, aerospace, oil
and gas entities, and government and nongovernmental organizations. Its geographic
targeting includes North America, Europe, and
the Middle East.

CHRYSENE
targets
manufacturing,
petrochemical, oil and gas, and electric
generation sectors. Targeting has expanded
beyond the group’s initial focus on the Persian
Gulf region, and the group remains active in
more than one area.4

WASSONITE targets manufacturing, electric
generation, nuclear energy, and research
entities in India, and likely South Korea and
Japan. The group’s operations rely on DTrack
malware, credential capture tools, and system
tools for lateral movement. WASSONITE has
operated since at least 2018.

Links: APT 34, GREENBUG, OilRig5

Links: Lazarus Group, COVELLITE9

MAGNALLIUM has targeted energy, aerospace,
and supporting entities since at least 2013.
Although MAGNALLIUM has not specifically
targeted manufacturing operations, chemical
manufacturing processes are within the scope
of victimology for this group. The activity
group initially targeted firms based in Saudi
Arabia but expanded targeting to include
entities in Europe and North America, including
U.S. electric utilities. MAGNALLIUM lacks an
ICS-specific capability, but the group remains
focused on initial IT intrusions.6

XENOTIME compromised several ICS vendors
and manufacturers, posing a potential supply
chain threat..10 This group is known for the
TRISIS attack that caused disruption at an oil
and gas facility in Saudi Arabia in August 2017. In
2018, XENOTIME activity expanded to include
electric utilities in North America and the AsiaPacific region; oil and gas companies in Europe,
the United States (U.S.), Australia, and the
Middle East. Expanded activity also includes
control system devices beyond the Triconex
controllers targeted in the 2017 incident.

3 Dragos categorizes ICS-targeting activity into activity groups based on observable elements that include an adversary’s methods of operation, infrastructure
used to execute actions, and the targets they focus on. The goal, as defined by the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, is to delineate an adversary by their
observed actions, capabilities, and demonstrated impact– not implied or assumed intentions. These attributes create a construct around which defensive plans can
be built. At this time, two activity groups possess ICS-specific capabilities and tools to cause disruptive events: XENOTIME and ELECTRUM.

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE

I C S M A LWA RE
Currently two activity groups, XENOTIME and ELECTRUM, have demonstrated the ability to
interact with and disrupt operations with malware specifically targeting ICS processes: TRISIS
and CRASHOVERRIDE12 malware respectively.13 Although Dragos has not observed either
malware family disrupting manufacturing operations, it is possible these adversaries will target
manufacturing companies in the process of developing such malware, even if they are not the
ultimate target.
For example, the 2016 CRASHOVERRIDE malware specifically targeted Siemens SIPROTEC
protective relays and ABB equipment, including all relevant communication protocols excluding
OPC Data Access (DA), at an electric transmission substation in Ukraine. Dragos observed some
large manufacturing companies may have their own power operations onsite containing the
same equipment. An adversary could theoretically leverage manufacturing operations as a
“testing ground” for disruptive attacks targeting critical infrastructure, like electric utilities, if
the same equipment is used. Dragos assesses it is likely manufacturing is a more attractive target
for an adversary’s offensive development due to generally less sophisticated cybersecurity
infrastructure and less government oversight.
The most infamous ICS malware, Stuxnet, also targeted manufacturing. First discovered in
2010, the worm targeted Iranian-owned Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) responsible for
controlling centrifuges used in Uranium enrichment. Unprecedented at the time, this cyberattack
was the first to cause physical damage to computerized systems.14

Ransomware
The most common threat to manufacturing
is ransomware. Dragos observed a significant
rise in the number of non-public and public
ransomware events that have affected ICS
environments and operations over the last
two years.
This year, Dragos identified multiple
ransomware strains adopting ICS-aware
functionality, including the ability to “kill”
(i.e., stop) industrial processes if identified in
the environment, with activity dating back
to 2019. EKANS,15 Megacortex, and Clop are
just a few ransomware strains that contain
this type of code.16 Past concerns with
ransomware in ICS focused on propagation.
IT-focused ransomware could impact control
system environments if it is able to migrate
into Windows-based portions of control
system networks and disrupt operations.

EKANS and other ICS-aware ransomware
represent a unique and specific risk to
industrial operations not previously observed
in ransomware operations.
In 2020, the number of publicly reported
ransomware attacks on manufacturing
entities has more than tripled compared
to 2019, based on data tracked by Dragos.
Although
most
ransomware
strains
impacting ICS and related entities are ITfocused, ransomware can have indirect
impacts on operations and process control
networks by impacting resources such as
logistics, fleet management, sales operations

and fulfillment, or loss of view to enterprise
resource management tools. For example,
enterprise technologies like Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) software are
integrated with data historians containing
process data to distribute information across a
company. By encrypting ERP and related files
on a workstation, a ransomware adversary
could stop vital communication and record
keeping, indirectly impacting manufacturing
process and logistics operations.

CASE STUDY
On 04 March 2020, a Ryuk infection at the manufacturer EVRAZ impacted North American operations
including email, shipping, product certification,
internet availability, and corporate networks. The
attack resulted in shutdowns of steel and pipe divisions, and temporary layoffs for over 1,000 workers
for at least four days.17

Ransomware operators are increasingly
incorporating data theft techniques into
their campaigns to further ransom demands.
An adversary may steal data from a target
company
before
encrypting
infected
machines and threaten to publish the data
online either on adversary-run websites
or hacking forums if a ransom demand is
not paid. This method could encourage
companies to pay ransoms demanded by
hackers. Data stolen or leaked by adversaries
could contain sensitive information on the
target company such as proprietary process
details and information about its equipment
suppliers. Although a ransomware adversary

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE
may only be interested in leveraging data for
financial purposes, adversaries interested
in specifically targeting manufacturing
operations could use leaked data to aid in attack
development. For example, an adversary
could use customer data to identify potential
opportunities for third-party or supply chain
compromise. Data like schematics, process
details, network diagrams, or other internal
documentation could be used to identify
targets for operational gain and assess the
level of obscurity a target has from internal
and external resources.
Ransomware is not just for financially
motivated
operators.
State-sponsored
actors may also leverage ransomware in
cyber operations targeting manufacturers.
In May 2020, the Republic of China (Taiwan)
government attributed ransomware events
targeting oil and gas and semiconductor
companies to the Winnti Group18 a threat
group that is likely state-associated activity.
The LockerGoga ransomware attack on Norsk
Hydro in 2019 may have been the work of
state-sponsored adversaries aiming to cause
disruption rather than make money from the
operation.19

Internet-Exposed Assets
Industrial and networking assets exposed to
the internet are a high risk for manufacturing
that can facilitate initial access to a victim
environment. Various tracked ICS-targeting
activity groups – PARISITE, MAGNALLIUM,
ALLANITE, and XENOTIME – have previously
targeted or currently attempt to exploit
remote access technology or logon
infrastructure.

According to the 2019 Dragos Year in
Review report detailing lessons learned
from the incident response and services
team, 66 percent of incident response cases
involved adversaries directly accessing
the ICS network from the internet, and
100 percent of organizations had routable
network connections into their operational
environments. 20 Recent cyber intrusions
targeting water infrastructure21 in Israel were
the result of Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) exposed to the open internet.
Dragos also responded to ransomware
events at industrial entities that leveraged
internet-connected remote access portals to
infiltrate the operations network and deploy
ransomware.
In July 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) and the National
Security Agency (NSA) published an alert
encouraging asset owners and operators to
take immediate actions restricting exposure
of OT assets to the internet.22 According to
the alert, behaviors observed recently before
publication include: spearphishing to gain
initial access to Information Technology (IT)
before pivoting to Operational Technology
(OT), deploying commodity ransomware
to impact both IT and OT environments,
connecting to internet accessible PLCs that
require no authentication, using common
ports and standard application layer
protocols to communicate with controllers
and download modified control logic, using
vendor engineering software and program
downloads, and modifying control logic
and parameters on programmable logic
controllers.

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE

CASE STUDY
In March 2020, Dragos identified an intrusion at a
North American entity aligned with PARISITE activity
that leveraged a vulnerability in Citrix Netscaler
Application Delivery Controller (ADC) for initial access.
CVE-2019-19781 was first identified in December 2019.
PARISITE is known for quickly incorporating publicly
identified vulnerabilities into attack operations and
has also exploited vulnerabilities in Virtual Private
Network (VPN) services.

Adversaries are quick to weaponize and exploit
vulnerabilities in internet-facing services
including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and
VPN services. New vulnerabilities revealed in
the summer of 2020 impact critical network
infrastructure services including F5, Palo Alto
Networks, Citrix, and Juniper network devices
will likely be exploited by ICS-targeting
adversaries, if they are not already. 23 These
vulnerabilities can enable adversaries to gain
initial access to enterprise operations and
potentially pivot into industrial operations.

ICS Vulnerabilities
In addition to the vulnerabilities in remote
services discussed above, vulnerabilities
in ICS-specific devices and services can
introduce risk to the manufacturing
environment. As of October 2020, Dragos
researchers assessed and validated 108
advisories containing 262 vulnerabilities
impacting industrial equipment found
in manufacturing environments. Dragos
found that almost half of the advisories
described a vulnerability that could

cause a loss of view and/or loss of control
within a compromised environment.
Of the vulnerabilities assessed by Dragos
impacting manufacturing industrial
equipment, 70 percent require access to
the victim network to exploit, 26 percent
require an adversary to have access to
the vulnerable device itself, and 8 percent
require an adversary to be on the local area
network to facilitate exploitation. Asset
owners and operators are encouraged to
be aware of the threat these vulnerabilities
pose to manufacturing operations. A
loss of view or control, for instance, may
cause safety concerns and potentially put
workers’ lives or the environment at risk.

IP Theft
Dragos assesses with high confidence
intellectual property theft and industrial
espionage are major threats to manufacturing
entities, especially by state-sponsored
adversaries and malicious insiders. In the
2018 report Foreign Economic Espionage
in Cyberspace, 24 the U.S. National
Counterintelligence and Security Center stated
China, Russia, and Iran are, “…three of the
most capable and active cyber actors tied to
economic espionage and the potential theft of
U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information.”
For example, insiders working on behalf
of Chinese state interests have stolen or
attempted to steal data from manufacturing and
related entities including Dow Chemical25 wind
turbine manufacturer Sinovel Wind Group,26
GlaxoSmithKline, 27 and biopharmaceutical
company Genentech28 In July 2020, the U.S.

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE
Department of Justice (DOJ) published an
indictment charging two Chinese nationals
with hacking hundreds of victim organizations
globally for over a decade on behalf of the
Ministry of State Security and other Chinese
government interests. Manufacturing and
related companies accounted for at least five
of the targeted victims, in addition to multiple
other ICS entities. The adversaries operating
under the Winnti Group umbrella have targeted
manufacturing and other industrial entities
globally, conducting initial access and espionage
operations. The information could support
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive
land and sea infrastructure and economic
development project across Asia, Europe, Indian
Ocean, South Pacific, and East Africa.

CASE STUDY
In 2019, Bayerischer Rundfunk reported adversaries
infiltrated automotive manufacturers BMW and
Hyundai. These adversaries were linked to Vietnamese
interests. 29 Car manufacturer VinFast – a subsidiary of
VinGroup, the Vietnamese conglomerate with close ties
to the country’s government 30 – had recently closed a
deal with BMW to license the carmaker’s technology,
architecture, and an engine, but not the manufacturing
process or sequencing automation details.31 It is
possible adversaries were looking for data to further
enrich the automotive manufacturing data already
obtained by VinFast to improve production quality,
though this is not confirmed. According to BMW, no
sensitive data was obtained.

The coronavirus pandemic is also causing an
increase in attacks targeting manufacturing
related entities. As countries race to develop
a vaccine for the pandemic that has killed
more than one million people globally,
adversaries have increasingly targeted

pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations
to steal ongoing research and development
related to the virus and potential vaccines.32
Currently, publicly reported attacks targeting
entities researching and/or developing
coronavirus vaccines and prevention have
demonstrated intrusion and reconnaissance
activities within enterprise resources, which
could facilitate movement into operations or
vaccine production tampering or disruption
in a worst-case scenario.
IP and theft of trade secrets related to
process and automation functions can enable
industrial organizations and interested states
and governments to fast-track development
of
critical
infrastructure,
including
manufacturing. It can also support statesponsored espionage activities for political or
national security efforts. Obtaining material
specifications for products is likely not
enough to replicate them. Businesses rely on
engineering and industrial design schematics,
and sequencing automation details. According
to Dragos researchers, adversaries may want
to steal the algorithms, engineering designs,
and programming specifications to replicate
the entire production process, not just the
material goods and services output.

Third-Party/Supply Chain
Since 2017, multiple threats migrated toward
compromising vendors, Managed Service
Providers (MSPs), and external network
services as the first step in victim compromise.
Adversaries can abuse existing trust
relationships and interconnectivity to gain
access to sensitive resources – including ICS

systems in some cases – with little likelihood
of detection.
Examples of this activity include activity
groups DYMALLOY and ALLANITE that
compromised vendors and contractors for
subsequent phishing campaigns targeting
the electric sector, 33 XENOTIME that targeted
several original equipment manufacturers and
vendors, and a widespread hacking campaign
by APT10 that hijacked connections between
MSPs and their customers, which included
manufacturing organizations.34
Contractors, vendors, and other thirdparty individuals often have direct access
to operational environments for activities
like updates, inspections, or new equipment
installations. It is possible for adversaries
to compromise equipment used by these
individuals as an access point into their
ultimate target.

CASE STUDY
In 2018, a shipping industry group detailed an incident
in which a bunker surveyor accidentally infected
shipboard computers with malware. 35 The ship had
completed bunkering operations, transporting oil to
another ship, and the bunker surveyor came aboard
to conduct quality assurance and documentation
efforts. The surveyor asked to use a host in the
engine control room to print documents and inserted
a USB drive containing malware. The ship operators
did not identify the malware until a subsequent
cybersecurity assessment.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) providers
also provide potential infection vectors that
could bridge the IT and OT gap if proper
segmentation and security are not in place.
ERP services require access to operations
assets like data historians to monitor and store

information relating to production, supply
chain, inventory, and safety. They should
be integrated into enterprise functions, like
compliance or finance. Recent vulnerability
exposures highlight the threat and potential
exploitation of these systems. In July 2020,
major ERP provider SAP published details and
patches for a critical vulnerability affecting
the SAP NetWeaver Application Server
(AS) Java component impacting numerous
SAP business solutions, including ERP. An
adversary could use the vulnerability to take
control of trusted SAP connections.36
Manufacturing entities are part of a
global supply chain supporting multiple
other industries, making them a target
for adversaries targeting industries like
electric utility or pharmaceutical. Some
manufacturing companies’ activities stretch
into multiple industrial verticals. Automotive
manufacturer Volkswagen in 2019 became
a renewable power provider and aims to
compete with energy companies on battery
energy storage and management 37
Leveraging third-party connections can
enable an adversary to conduct espionage,
reconnaissance, and data theft operations
to pre-position themselves for a potentially
disruptive OT attack. Due to interconnected
relationships manufacturing companies have
across industrial verticals, asset owners and
operators should be aware of threats to all ICS
entities and incorporate ICS-specific threat
intelligence into security operations and risk
management.

Network Segmentation
The cybersecurity maturity of manufacturers
varies based on industry, regulatory
requirements, geographic location, and
a variety of other factors. However, it
is not unusual to see “flat networks” in
manufacturing environments. This is when
network connections are shared across
both enterprise and operational segments.
This makes it easier for an adversary to
bridge the IT and OT boundary, and disrupt
manufacturing operations after pivoting
from an access point in IT.
If segmentation does exist between enterprise
and operations leveraging jump hosts and
access restrictions, manufacturing facilities
often leverage the same Wide Area Network
(WAN) connection across all manufacturing
plants. This could enable an adversary to
compromise an entire company’s operations
if they are able to access one facility’s
operations.
The perils of flat networks were broadly
demonstrated in 2017. That year, WannaCry
and NotPetya wormable ransomware
and malware attacks spread across the
globe, disrupting operations at numerous
manufacturers.38 The worms exploited a
vulnerability in an old version of Microsoft’s
Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and
continuous credential theft and reuse to
spread. Due to interconnections between
IT and OT via poor network segmentation,
maintenance
interconnections
between

environments, and a lack of access restrictions,
malware wormed its way through industrial
operations causing billions of dollars in losses.
Although the WannaCry and NotPetya events
served as a wakeup call across manufacturers
globally, three years later improper network
segmentation remains an issue.

CASE STUDY
In 2020, Dragos observed EKANS ransomware
incorporating domain checks to identify if a victim
network’s Windows Active Directory (AD) instance
could be contacted. Honda was one of its victims,
and the ransomware disrupted the automotive
manufacturer’s operations across five countries. This
suggests poor network segmentation in at least parts
of its global operations.39

Wi-Fi Connections
In addition to internet-connected process
automation and other “smart” manufacturing
processes, operators are adopting WiFi enabled machine tools and diagnostic
equipment that enable workers to move
around plants and factories without tripping
over power cords. Internet connected
tools connect to historian databases for
quality assurance, regulatory, and logistics
purposes, among others. Often these tools
are connected to enterprise or operations
resources and can be used as network access
points or targeted in an attack meant to

disrupt production and impede operations.
Logistics applications and services enable
moving parts of manufacturing assets –
such as vehicles, drivers, and goods – to

assets like warehouses or human resources.
Employees and contractors use mobile and
desktop hardware with Wi-Fi connections to
use applications and services, and regularly

CASE STUDY:

operations rely on these services, and even a
small incident can mean significant disruption
to manufacturing operations and impact
customers, products, and services..

Lack of Visibility
As manufacturing operations become
increasingly connected, a lack of visibility into
processes, assets, and connections remain
within these environments. It is difficult to
defend against threats operators do not see.

New Zealand meat processing company Affco
experienced a ransomware attack in March 2020.
The attack disrupted Affco’s meat processing
and delivery, sales and order fulfillment, and other
business services. Although the initial infection
vector is not publicly known, the ransomware had
widespread disruption across the company’s supply
chain in IT and OT operations.40

According to the Dragos 2019 Year in
Review report, 81 percent of organizations
the Dragos Services team worked with had
extremely limited or no visibility into the
ICS/OT network. Observations from incident
response engagements found no instances
of security and process data aggregation for
incident analysis requiring manual retrieval of
logs and distributed analysis.

Logistics technologies can ensure a timely,
streamlined supply chain, but are very
sensitive to any disruption. If one device in the
logistics network is compromised, malware or
adversaries can spread through all segments
where the device connects. Time-sensitive

It is crucial that, moving forward, asset owners
and operators across all manufacturing sectors
and operations – including engineering,
assembly, and logistics – improve network
and host visibility to identify and defend
against the growing threat landscape.

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE

DEFEN SI V E R ECOMMENDAT I ON S
Manufacturing entities are all different, and
the cybersecurity mechanisms, network
architecture, and risk they are willing to accept
will vary between industries. For instance,
in food and pharmaceutical industries,
regulations are in place to monitor safety
and security of products manufactured
and distributed to the public. However,
the following recommendations should be
practiced by all manufacturing entities to
improve overall security of environments.
• Conduct architecture reviews to identify all
assets, connections, and communications
between IT and OT networks. Identify
Demilitarized Zones (DMZs) to restrict
traffic between enclaves. Critically examine
and limit connections between corporate
and ICS networks to only known, required
traffic.
• Ensure an understanding of network
interdependencies and conduct crown jewel
analysis to identify potential weaknesses
that could disrupt business continuity.
• Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
wherever possible, especially on perimeter
devices and login portals. Focus critically on
connections to integrators, maintenance,
vendor personnel, and crown jewels such
as safety equipment. If MFA cannot be
implemented on internal equipment, ensure
strong, hard-to-guess passwords are used
for all credentials.
• Ensure backups of enterprise network
systems are maintained and test backups
during disaster recovery simulations. Create
an ICS specific incident response plan and
conduct tabletop exercises to practice how
to handle different incidents.
D R AG O S , I n c .

• Passively identify and monitor ICS network
assets to identify key assets, chokepoints,
and external communications in the
network.
• Look for threat behaviors and known
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
that adversaries targeting manufacturing
use, like those mapped to MITRE® ATT&CK
for ICS.
• Monitor outbound communications from
ICS networks to detect malicious threat
behaviors, indicators, and anomalies.
Understanding
malicious
behaviors
exhibited by threat activity groups is crucial
for defending against them.
• Identify and label critical ICS assets to aid
with detection and monitoring. Dragos
Asset Identification allows for certain
analytics to function by detecting malicious
behaviors against asset types.
• Leverage industrial-specific threat detection
mechanisms to identify malware within OT
and reinforce defense in depth strategies at
the network level, leading to a more robust
investigation ability by defenders and
analysts.
• Ensure corporate networks are patched to
prevent malware infections from entering
the environment and to prevent subsequent
propagation.
• Ensure that critical network services, such
as Active Directory (AD) and the servers
hosting it, are well-defended and that
administrative access to hosting devices is
restricted to the greatest degree possible.
• Evaluate and limit AD federation and
sharing between IT and ICS networks to
12

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE
the greatest extent possible. Among other
items, create dedicated security groups for
OT systems within a shared AD environment
and limit permission for deploying Group
Policy Objects (GPOs) or other changes to
only a subset of administrators to reduce
attack surface.
• Ensure networks are segmented to the
greatest extent possible. If segmentation
is not possible, ensure emergency response
plans are well-documented to detail
segmentation efforts in case of emergency
such as a malware infection. For example,
implement firewall rules to segment off
critical ICS components from the network
that can be activated and deactivated
depending on the safety and security of the
environment and any potential malicious
activity.

• Services and equipment that are not
needed for real-time communications
or direct access to operations should be
virtualized. This can improve vulnerability
management and enable improved security
for interdependencies. For example,
Engineering Workstations (EWS) and
Human Machine Interface (HMI) operations
may be able to be virtualized.
• Isolate equipment and services used for
Building Access Control (BAC) and Heating,
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC).
These services can be considered secondary
or support systems that are critical to
maintaining safe, reliable manufacturing
operations and considered potential
targets for adversaries seeking to disrupt
manufacturing production.

CYBER THREAT PERSPECTIVE

CONCLU SI ON
A concerning upward trend of ransomware targeting manufacturing companies leading to operations disruptions exists. Internet exposed assets, supply chain and third-party compromise
risks, and a growing convergence of interconnected enterprise and operations networks are
contributing to a growing threat landscape.
Dragos continues to monitor malicious activity groups and threats targeting manufacturing
operations, including concerning ICS-aware ransomware capable of disrupting operations. Additionally, adversaries do not need to specifically target industrial processes to achieve widespread
disruption across plants, fleets, or automation processes, as detailed in this report.
Dragos assesses with high confidence the threats to manufacturing will continue to increase
over the next year.
