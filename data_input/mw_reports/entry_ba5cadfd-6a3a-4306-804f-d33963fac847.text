Attracting flies with Honey(gain): Adversarial abuse of
proxyware
blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/proxyware-abuse.html

By Edmund Brumaghin and Vitor Ventura.
With internet-sharing applications, or "proxyware," users download software that allows
them to share a percentage of their bandwidth with other internet users for a fee, with
the companies that created this software acting as a go-between.
1/32

As proxyware has grown in popularity, attackers have taken notice and are now
attempting to exploit this interest to monetize their malware campaigns.
Malware is currently leveraging these platforms to monetize the internet bandwidth of
victims, similar to how malicious cryptocurrency mining attempts to monetize the CPU
cycles of infected systems.
In many cases, these applications are featured in multi-stage, multi-payload malware
attacks that provide adversaries with multiple monetization methods.
Trojanized installers are some of the most common threats taking advantage of public
interest in proxyware to infect victims.
These applications pose significant privacy and operational risks to organizations as
they may allow nefarious or abusive network traffic to appear as if it originates from
their corporate networks resulting in reputational damages that may also lead to
service disruption.

What's new?
Adversaries are finding new ways to monetize their attacks by abusing internet-sharing, or
"proxyware" platforms like Honeygain, Nanowire, and others. This poses new challenges to
organizations, especially to those whose internet access is rated as residential. But any
organization could be at risk, as there are platforms that also allow data center-based
internet sharing.

How did it work?
Malicious actors are taking multiple avenues to monetize these new platforms in their favor.
The most obvious one is the silent installation of the platform client to "sell" the victim's
bandwidth without their knowledge. In some cases, the adversaries patch the client to stop
any alerts that would warn the victim. As these platforms became more popular, the
adversaries started to leverage trojanized installers, which install the legitimate platform
client as well as digital currency miners and information stealers. Given the nature of
proxyware services, the users expect that their performance will suffer, making it a perfect
disguise for coin miners.
Cisco Talos also identified a malware family that will deploy a complete set of monetization
methods — it drops a patched version of the Honeygain client, an XMRig miner and an
information stealer. On top of that, it seems to be evolving to also deploy a Nanowire client,
another one of these proxyware applications.

So what?
2/32

Organizations should be aware of these applications, how they work, and how they are being
taken advantage of, as they may pose a significant risk to corporate environments. Users'
bandwidth can be sold to platform customers to access the internet, while the actions
performed by them over this access are logged to the organization's IP address. This is a
recent trend, but the potential to grow is enormous. We are already seeing serious abuse by
threat actors that stand to make a significant amount of money off these attacks. These
networks may also allow threat actors to obfuscate the source of their attacks, making them
appear as if they are originating from legitimate corporate networks. Security analysts could
struggle to analyze and/or respond to these attacks and render conventional network
defenses that rely on reputation or IP-based blocklists ineffective. Some users or
organizations could even eventually become wrapped up in part of a law enforcement
investigation if their infrastructure is used for illicit or illegal purposes.

Introduction to proxyware
Proxyware platforms enable users to sell the use of their unused internet bandwidth, typically
by running a client application. The client application is responsible for joining their system to
a network that is operated by the platform provider. The provider then sells access to this
network and routes customer traffic through the network, allowing their customers to access
the internet using the bandwidth and internet connections provided by nodes on the network.
In many cases, this type of service is advertised as a way for marketing organizations to
access resources from residential networks in a variety of geographic regions to test
potential campaigns and circumvent network restrictions. For the home users, this is
advertised as a means to circumvent geolocation checks on streaming or gaming platforms
while generating some income for the user offering up their bandwidth. Many of these
platforms have emerged in recent years, including Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, Nanowire,
Peer2Profit and PacketStream, though there are likely several more.

What could possibly go wrong?
In many cases, the users of these platforms are either not aware of the operational or privacy
implications of running these clients on their systems/networks, or they simply view the
earnings potential as outweighing the perceived costs associated with granting the use of
their resources to random entities. In either case, the use of these platforms introduces risks
that may not be immediately apparent to many people.
Most obviously, there are privacy implications for entities who purchase and use the
networks provided by these platforms. In the case of the Honeygain platform, because of the
way the communications are processed to facilitate the retrieval and delivery of content, it

3/32

may be possible to monitor the DNS activity of other platform users. Unencrypted content
that is retrieved (like HTTP) could be intercepted and manipulated in transit by Honeygain
nodes under adversarial control, creating a range of plausible attack scenarios.
Since these platforms allow external entities to make direct use of users' network
connections, this results in network traffic that appears to originate from these users'
networks. The use of this communications pathway for illegal or illicit purposes could create
legal liability for unsuspecting platform users. In some cases, we observed users reporting
that their home networks were experiencing service degradation due to being blocked from
accessing various internet resources after installing these client applications.

Post on Honeygain subreddit.
While it is unclear if this was the direct result of nefarious traffic traversing the connectivity
pathway provided by these platforms, it is reasonable to assume that there are
circumstances where abusive traffic generated by these clients could lead to this scenario. It
was not uncommon to see these reports when researching the user communities associated
with these platforms.
We also observed several instances of Honeygain users claiming to maximize their profits by
installing the software on relatives and/or acquaintances' computers, thus transferring these
same risks to those individuals.

Post on Honeygain subreddit.
In situations where malware is used to covertly install these applications on victim systems
as part of an attacker's monetization strategy, this could also lead to direct financial losses in
4/32

cases where the victim is on a limited data plan and is forced to pay overages or other fees
to cover the excess bandwidth used by the proxyware application.
Some users are also reportedly installing these clients on computers at their workplaces.
Now that many organizations are using a hybrid work model, these applications may
introduce many of the same risks to organizational environments if these applications are
installed on employees' devices.

Post on Honeygain subreddit.
In some instances, this is actively encouraged by the platform providers themselves. Below
is a screenshot from the FAQs for one proxyware platform provider.

Peer2Profit FAQs.
Endpoints in corporate environments running these applications could create a situation
where abusive traffic appears to originate from the corporate network and may result in
adverse reputational effects, leading to operational issues such as corporate networks
ending up on reputation-based blocklists. Likewise, these applications effectively establish a
tunneled communications pathway between an external entity and an endpoint on an internal
network segment that may circumvent conventional perimeter-based inspection and threat

5/32

detection capabilities. Abuse of the client application itself could also lead to the successful
compromise of systems located inside corporate networks.
Adversaries may also take advantage of this network model by conducting their attacks
using the network created by proxyware platforms. This could result in their attacks
appearing as if they were originating from various residential networks around the world, and
may make analyzing and responding to attacks more difficult. The same mechanisms
currently used to monitor and track Tor exit nodes, "anonymous" proxies, and other common
traffic obfuscation techniques do not currently exist for tracking nodes within these proxyware
networks.

How widespread is proxyware?
This business model has become increasingly attractive to users, as it provides a way for
them to generate passive income with their unused network bandwidth. The subscriber
growth of the Honeygain subreddit provides a good visual representation of this trend.

One proxyware platform, Peer2Profit, claims to have enrolled roughly 55,000 users on the
platform.

6/32

Honeygain, one of the most popular proxyware platforms, recently released the details of a
2021 User Experience and Awareness Survey. In their report, they claim to have received
approximately 250,000 survey responses from Honeygain users, which it reports is 16 times
more than those it received in 2020.

Investigating DNS activity associated with the API used by the Honeygain client, we
identified a large number of queries being performed. This is another indicator that clearly
demonstrates the popularity of this platform across the internet.

7/32

The majority of the systems observed resolving the domain associated with the Honeygain
API were located in Brazil, however, activity was observed across many other countries, as
well.

Users aren't the only ones who have taken notice of these relatively new platforms. Threat
actors have also set their sights on finding ways to leverage these same platforms to
monetize their malware attacks.

8/32

As most of these platforms function differently, we will focus the majority of the analysis in
this blog on one of the most popular ones, Honeygain. While this post focuses on threats
targeting the Windows platform, Honeygain also offers an Android client, which behaves
similarly to the Windows client. At the time of writing, we did not identify any cases where the
Android client was being used nefariously or otherwise abusing users' devices.

Malware campaigns
During our analysis of malicious activity associated with proxyware applications, we identified
several methods adversaries are using to increase the effectiveness of their malware
campaigns. Throughout the course of this research, we identified a variety of different
malware families being distributed under the guise of legitimate installers for applications like
Honeygain. These trojanized installers enable adversaries to distribute threats like RATs,
information stealers, and other malware to victims who believe they are installing legitimate
applications.
In other cases, threat actors are distributing the proxyware applications to monetize victims'
network bandwidth for the purposes of generating revenue. We also observed malware that
attempted to leverage victims' CPU resources for mining cryptocurrency, while at the same
time also monetizing their network bandwidth using proxyware applications. The following
sections provide analysis of a few of the most interesting campaigns we've discovered.

Trojanized Installers
One of the most common techniques we observed was the use of legitimate installers as
decoy programs included alongside other malicious components. In these attacks, threat
actors are distributing malicious executables that pose as installers for legitimate proxyware
applications like Honeygain. When executed, they will typically install the legitimate
application, while also silently installing malware.
In one example, an attacker was distributing cryptocurrency mining malware under the guise
of a Honeygain installer. The initial malware dropper was an installer bundle that was created
using Smart Install Maker. The bundle contained a legitimate, signed Honeygain installation
package along with the malware. The malware featured a multi-stage infection process and
relied on the use of multiple distinct components, as shown below.

9/32

Initial installation
When executed, the installer bundle extracts various components into the %TEMP%
directory on the system, then executes the legitimate Honeygain installer, which is what is
displayed to the victim. At the same time, the installer also silently creates and executes
various components required for the malware's operation.
The main Honeygain program directory used during the installation process is located at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\HG\Honey gain\

The malware stores two malicious files — setup_x86.exe and url.vbs — in this same
directory.
The malware also creates a working directory at
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\intelx86_driver and writes the main cryptocurrency
mining dropper (iv.exe) into this directory. This payload is then executed by the installer to
run the payload and start the mining process.

10/32

The VBScript file (url.vbs) is also executed by the initial installer process and is used to
launch a web browser on the infected system and redirect the victim to a landing page
associated with a Honeygain referral code, presumably tied to the malware author's account.
The VBScript associated with this operation is below:

When this is executed, the victim is taken to the landing page associated with the Honeygain
referral code. This provides another mechanism that an attacker can use to monetize
infections by allowing them to generate revenue for each victim who uses the landing page
to sign up for a Honeygain account.

The initial installer then executes setup_x86.exe, which is used to achieve persistence and
iv.exe — the cryptocurrency mining component — before terminating execution.

Additional installation & persistence
Additional setup and installation tasks are performed by setup_x86.exe. It first invokes the

11/32

Windows Service Configuration Tool (sc.exe) to stop and delete a Windows service called
"Wwanip" using the following command-line syntax:
"C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe" stop Wwanip
"C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe" delete Wwanip

It then creates a directory structure under "C:\Users\SYSTEM" and stores the following
components:
C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\sysdll.exe
C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\vxml.xml
C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\ixml.xml
C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\sc.md

Then, it creates an executable at the following location:
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\intelx86_driver/service.exe

Next, the malware uses two Scheduled Tasks and a Windows Service to achieve persistence
on the victim machine.
The first scheduled task is created using an XML configuration via the following syntax:
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /create /xml
"C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\vxml.xml" /tn
"Desktop Windows Manager Adapter For Microsoft Windows" /ru "system"

The XML configuration instructs the scheduled task to execute
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\intelx86_driver\intel_vga.exe at system startup, allowing
persistence across system reboots.
A second scheduled task is then created, which uses another XML configuration via the
following syntax:
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /create /xml
"C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\ixml.xml" /tn
"Virtual Disk Manager Adapter For Microsoft Windows" /ru "system"

The XML configuration file associated with this scheduled task defines a series of time-based
triggers that are used to execute
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\intelx86_driver\service.exe on the following schedule:

Finally, a new Windows service is created and configured to start automatically at system
boot. The service is then immediately started. This new service is created using the following

12/32

command:
"C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe" create Wwanip binPath=
"C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\sysdll.exe"
start= auto

The service.exe mentioned previously is effectively a copy of setup_x86.exe. It drops the
same files and creates the same scheduled tasks. The main difference is that service.exe is
packed with a non-standard version of Smart Install Maker.
The setup_x86.exe process also creates an uninstall executable and its INI file at the
filesystem path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Corporation\Microsoft Visual C++ 2013
Redistributable (x86) - 19.1.30" just as a legitimate installer package would.

Update mechanism
As previously described, during the malware installation process, persistence is achieved for
C:\Users\SYSTEM\AppData\Roaming\Intel\Graphics_driver\Graphics_driver\sysdll.exe via
the creation of a Windows service called "Wwanip."
This service invokes a .NET executable that is responsible for retrieving updates from the
command and control (C2) and using the contents returned from the server to overwrite
previously saved malware components. This mechanism is likely used to ensure that the
malware is periodically updated with the latest version available. The executable contains
two primary functions — OnStart() and OnTimer() — that facilitate this process.

As seen above, the OnStart() function is responsible for retrieving additional data from the
C2 and copying the returned data to

13/32

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\intelx86_driver\intel_vga.exe, likely as a way to ensure
that the most recent version of the malware continues to run on previously infected systems.
The OnTimer() function operates similarly, however it is also responsible for ensuring that the
services.exe file is also present on the system in the case that it is removed or otherwise
unavailable.

Below is a screenshot showing an example of the HTTP request made by the sysdll.exe
process for the purpose of requesting the latest version of the malware.

At the time of analysis, the C2 was no longer active. However, historical data shows that the
C2 was previously responding with binary contents to client requests for this URL. The binary
delivered in these cases matches the cryptocurrency mining component initially dropped
onto the system (iv.exe) and operates as described in the following section.

Cryptocurrency miner payload
The main cryptocurrency mining payload (iv.exe) is created and executed during the initial
installation process described earlier. Another copy (intel_vga.exe) is also periodically
retrieved from C2 as described in the previous section enabling it to persist across reboots
via a Scheduled Task.
It is a .NET executable that includes two encrypted resources.

During execution, these resources are retrieved and decrypted using a function called
AES_Decryptor().

14/32

One of the resources is responsible for injecting the final cryptocurrency mining payload
(XMRig) into a remote process, in this case associated with svchost.exe.

In this example, XMRig is executed using the following parameters:
C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -B --donate-level=1 -a null -o heartsbeat[.]gq:3333 u user -p coucou -o gulf[.]moneroocean[.]stream:10004 -u
45dLToERxNfcTR3AH2tJmr3xP3wuDyeap9UTaH5EtMHyB9zEeUN9XMo6PMdHFGjNkKgPKiAGZeQjtbVWLML3J6
-p Homerig --opencl -t 2 --cpu-max-threads-hint=60

Investigating the mining pool being used, it does not appear that this campaign has been
very successful thus far, as only about 2.19 XMR have been paid out at the time of this
writing.

As proxyware applications become more popular, we will likely see many more examples of
malware leveraging legitimate installers as part of their malware to convince victims to infect
their systems.

Honeygain botnets?
In addition to malware that leverages proxyware applications as decoys during the infection
process, we identified malware that attempts to install Honeygain and register the newly
15/32

installed client with the attacker's Honeygain account, allowing them to monetize bandwidth
on infected systems. While Honeygain limits the number of devices operating under a single
account, there is nothing to stop an attacker from registering multiple Honeygain accounts to
scale their operation based on the number of infected systems under their control.
In one example, we identified an attacker attempting to do just that. In this case, the initial
malicious executable contained three resources that were Base64 encoded. An example of
one of these resources is shown below.

These three resources correspond to the following components used by the malware.
The main program executable associated with the application 7-Zip.
A DLL used by the 7-Zip application.
A ZIP archive containing a copy of the Honeygain program directory from a previously
installed system.
When the initial binary is executed, it is responsible for extracting these resources and
creating a working directory called "Winint" within %APPDATA% on the system. The 7-Zip
application and DLL are then stored inside of this directory. The ZIP archive is extracted
using the following syntax:
%APPDATA%\Winint\Winint\7z.exe e %APPDATA%\Winint\Winint\winint.zip -o
%APPDATA%\Winint\Winint -y

An executable stored in this directory (winint32.exe) is then executed, which launches the
Honeygain application. This binary appears to be a modified copy of the legitimate .NET
executable associated with Honeygain v.0.6.4.0. Some of the design elements have been
removed to prevent the main application from being displayed to victims.
The main() function of the application has been modified to allow persistence to be achieved
on infected systems to ensure that the Honeygain application is executed at system boot as
well as every minute if it is terminated for any reason. A comparison view of the normal
main() function and the one included in the malicious executable can be seen below.

16/32

The executable also includes hardcoded credentials that are used to authenticate to the
Honeygain API when the application is run, allowing the victim's system to be associated
with an existing Honeygain account. The following screenshot shows this modification to the
Honeygain application.

17/32

This activity can also be observed by intercepting and inspecting the API communications
from an infected system. In this case, it appears that the Honeygain account has already
exceeded the total number of clients allowed to be registered.

This demonstrates another way that attackers have identified to monetize the resources of
systems that they can infect. Unlike cryptocurrency mining malware, which attempts to
monetize the CPU resources of infected systems, this type of malware attempts to monetize
the internet connection of the system. This could prove particularly damaging to victims who
may have limited monthly bandwidth subscriptions and potentially cause them to incur direct
18/32

monetary losses due to additional usage charges that may result from Honeygain running at
all times on their system.

Multi-payload monetization
Talos researchers also identified examples of malware campaigns attempting to
simultaneously use multiple methods for monetizing successful infections. In one case, we
identified a multi-stage malware campaign that was being used to deliver an information
stealer, cryptocurrency mining malware, as well as proxyware software to generate revenue
using the resources of infected systems.
This is a textbook example of the varied approaches available to adversaries. Attackers are
no longer content with simply deploying cryptocurrency mining to make money — they are
now also stealing sensitive data and monetizing network bandwidth, all at the same time.
Below is a high-level diagram depicting the overall execution flow of the malware in this
case.

The following sections describe the functionality associated with each component in the
infection process.
19/32

Stage 1: Initial loader
The initial malware loader, written in C++, is a standard unpacked binary that appears to be
undergoing active development. This downloader is responsible for initiating all of the
subsequent stages of this infection chain.
It begins by attempting to create the mutex "LIJKMERGL32D23890NUFEWOIHJ," exiting if it
fails. Afterward, it creates a directory called "Shared Resources" located within
%APPDATA%\Roaming. Then, it copies itself into this newly created directory with the
filename "Numerical Resources Monitor.exe." The malware creates a Windows Registry run
entry called "Shared Resources Monitor" that points to the new binary location. This entry is
created under "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run."
This downloader, like most of the other components used by the malware, also sends HTTP
requests to the attacker via the IPLogger URL shortener to log the current status of the
infection process. It will report that it is running, the version of the dropper and the processor
characteristics.
Before downloading the payload, it checks if their processes are already running, reporting it
back to the C2. The loader then attempts to download the second stage binaries, which in
reality, are downloaders for the final malware payloads. The first one is responsible for
deploying an XMRig cryptocurrency miner, which is stored in the
"%APPDATA%\Roaming\Monitoring Statistics\" directory with the filename
MobileStatsMonitor.exe. Afterward, it downloads an additional loader to deploy proxyware
applications that will attempt to monetize the victim's bandwidth. Finally, it attempts to
download and execute a homemade password stealer. Each of these components are
described in detail in the following sections.

Stage 2A: XMRig cryptocurrency miner dropper
This executable performs two tasks. First, it downloads the XMRig payload from Dropbox
and launches it with the necessary configuration to mine the Monero cryptocurrency.

There is no persistence mechanism established for the XMRig downloader or for the mining
executable. Its configuration is hardcoded into the stage 2 downloader executable. The
parameters used to execute XMRig are shown below:

20/32

The initial downloader acts as a persistence mechanism for subsequent stages and functions
as an update mechanism for the miner. Each time the system reboots, the initial loader will
retrieve the latest available payloads and execute them each time.
This loader also downloads and attempts to execute an information stealer. However, due to
a programming error in the downloader, the execution fails.
Both executables are Base64 encoded and then obfuscated with a char-by-char XOR
operation that uses the key "3." This obfuscation method derives the key from a sequence of
logical and bit shifting operations.

Stage 2B: Information stealer
The information stealer is essentially a dropper for two well-known password recovery
utilities: ChromePass and WebBrowserPassView, both available from NirSoft. These utilities
are commonly used to retrieve sensitive information from applications so that it can be
transmitted and further monetized by the attacker.

21/32

The tools are obfuscated in the same manner as described in the previous section. The
output is exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server different from the C2. Once the upload is
performed, both results and the utilities are removed from the system.
This component, like others mentioned in this analysis, appears to be in early stages of
development. There is code present in this executable to also extract Chrome and Firefox
profile information, but that code is never executed.

Stage 2C: Honeygain & Nanowire loader
Honeygain is not the only platform capable of being abused. We observed a Stage 2
malware payload being delivered that contained the functionality to retrieve and execute
Honeygain or Nanowire (or both) on infected systems. While it currently appears to be under
active development, it further demonstrates how attackers weaponize these proxyware
platforms.
In this particular case, the Stage 2 payload functions as a loader and is capable of retrieving
several additional components which were being hosted on Dropbox.
These components included:
A ZIP archive containing the Honeygain program directory.
A Nanowire application executable.
A Nanowire configuration file.
A Honeygain configuration file.
The malware attempts to retrieve a ZIP archive hosted on Dropbox that contains a copy of
the Honeygain program directory that is normally created during the installation of the
Honeygain application. In this case, it appears to have been taken from a system on which
the attacker previously installed Honeygain.
A function called "GetExeLocalAppDataUserConfigPath()" also checks for a specific
Honeygain configuration file and, if needed, attempts to replace it with one retrieved from
Dropbox.

22/32

The Honeygain configuration file in this case contains the API key needed for the malware to
authenticate to the Honeygain platform and register the infected system under the attacker's
account, allowing them to generate revenue.

Prior to launching the Honeygain client application, the malware also attempts to disable
program notifications by modifying the Windows Registry and restarting the "Windows Push
Notifications User Service (WpnUserService)" using a function called DisableNotifs().

When the Honeygain client is finally started, the API key is sent to the Honeygain platform to
allow the client to authenticate. An example of one of the Honeygain client API requests
containing the token is below.

23/32

The malware also contains the functionality required to download and execute Nanowire on
the infected system. An example of the DLNanowire() function, which could be used to
retrieve the Nanowire executable and associated configuration file, can be seen below.

The parameters in the function above are responsible for silently launching the Nanowire
client in "sell" mode which allows the infected system's internet connection to be used by
other members of the Nanowire network in order to generate revenue for the attacker. The
configuration files that are retrieved are used to ensure that infected systems are associated
with the attacker's account across the platforms so that revenue can be obtained. Below is
an example of a portion of the Nanowire configuration file hosted at the Dropbox URL
contained in the malware in this case.

24/32

The configuration also limits the amount of bandwidth that is made available to the Nanowire
network, in this case 20mbps. A comparable configuration file is also retrievable for use with
the Honeygain application.
A function called Startup() is responsible for achieving persistence on infected systems
through the use of a Windows Registry run entry within HKCU.

The executable also features a SendToPanel() function that is responsible for sending
information to a remote server using the specified User-Agent. The URL points to the
IPLogger URL-shortening service.

25/32

At the time of writing, this shortened URL was resolved to hXXps[:]//www[.]test[.]com which
may indicate that this functionality is still currently under development and not in use at this
time, but may be used by the attacker in the future. An example of one of these POST
requests is shown below.

In the sample we analyzed, the DLNanowire() function was not directly called. However, its
presence and the payload being actively hosted at the specified Dropbox URL indicates that
this functionality is fully working and available for use by the adversary.

Command & control (C2)
This malware uses the IPLogger URL-shortening service to facilitate C2 communications
between the infected system and the attacker-controlled infrastructure. Throughout each
stage of the infection process, the malware transmits status updates by embedding the
information into the User-Agent header of HTTP requests that are made. These requests are
sent to specific IPLogger URLs that are typically configured to forward the requests to the
actual infrastructure being monitored by the threat actor. This occurs at strategic points at
each stage of the infection process to provide ongoing updates on the progress of the overall
infection process and notify the threat actor if issues are encountered. The following image
shows an example of the status update that is sent when the XMRig miner is successfully
executed.

26/32

Similar messages can be observed for many of the components executed throughout the
infection. When errors are encountered, they are also transmitted to the attacker using the
same mechanism. Below is an example request related to the failed deployment of the
Honeygain client.

The information stealer described in the information stealer section is responsible for
exfiltrating sensitive information from infected systems. The collected data is transmitted to
an attacker-controlled server via an HTTP POST request as defined in the Upload() function
present in the stealer.

The aforementioned examples demonstrate the varied approaches currently being used by
adversaries attempting to identify new ways to more effectively infect victims and attempt to
monetize their malware distribution operations. As these platforms continue to gain in
popularity, we will likely continue to see examples of this sort of abuse on a larger scale.

Is proxyware software malicious?
The use of proxyware has become increasingly widespread over the past couple of years.
These platforms may introduce significant risk to most corporate environments. In cases
where proxyware has been installed on corporate assets, the security team should be
alerted. Organizations may want to conduct response activities to determine if its presence is
due to successful malware infection or a policy violation if it was installed by an employee. In
either case, proxyware software should be considered a potentially unwanted application
27/32

(PUA) or potentially unwanted program (PUP) and treated in a similar manner to
cryptocurrency mining software that may be discovered in the environment.

Conclusion
These relatively new platforms were built with a legitimate purpose, but attackers quickly
found ways to abuse them. It's not the first time we have documented abuses of legitimate
platforms — a good example is the research we posted about the abuse of the Discord and
Slack content delivery networks. We believe attackers are highly likely to abuse these
proxyware platforms, as they can be used to disguise an attacker's origin more efficiently
than Tor, since the exit nodes cannot be cataloged. For organizations, these platforms pose
two essential problems: The abuse of their resources, eventually being blocklisted due to
activities they don't even control and it increases organizations' attack surface, potentially
creating an initial attack vector directly on the endpoint.
These platforms also pose new challenges for researchers, since there is no way to identify
a connection through these kinds of networks — the origin IP becomes even less meaningful
in an investigation. Due to the various risks associated with these platforms, it is
recommended that organizations consider prohibiting the use of these applications on
corporate assets. In most cases, endpoints should not be communicating with the networks
associated with these platforms, and organizations should consider deploying
comprehensive logging and alerting mechanisms to ensure that they can effectively detect
and respond when systems within the environment begin communicating with them as this
could be an indicator that the system has been compromised.
