Executive Summary
Kraken Cryptor is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program
that was introduced on August 16, 2018, on a top-tier Russianspeaking cybercriminal forum by the threat actor ThisWasKraken.
Kraken Cryptor has gained popularity among members of the
dark web, has been used to target users of the popular antivirus
program SuperAntiSpyware, and has also been distributed through
the Fallout exploit kit.

Key Judgments
• The Kraken Cryptor ransomware was first seen in the wild in
August 2018.
• Kraken is distributed by members of an affiliate program
operated by ThisWasKraken, who is only active on Russian
criminal forums.
• To distribute malware, ThisWasKraken and/or its affiliates
likely use the Fallout exploit kit.
• We have identified that ThisWasKraken is using online casino
BitcoinPenguin to launder illicitly gained funds.
• Insikt Group assesses with a high degree of confidence that
ThisWasKraken works within a team, whose members could
be residing in Iran, Brazil, or former Soviet bloc countries.

Background
The Kraken Cryptor ransomware is a connectionless strain of
ransomware that communicates with victims via email in place of
any command and control (C2) infrastructure or landing pages.
Kraken was first observed in the wild in August 2018 and gained
notoriety when it was distributed from the compromised website
of SuperAntiSpyware, disguised as the antivirus program.1 Kraken
has also been distributed to victims via spam and malvertising
campaigns, some of which redirect to the Fallout exploit kit for the
final installation phase.
Insikt Group has attributed the Kraken Cryptor ransomware to the
threat actor ThisWasKraken, who operates the affiliate program that
gives other actors access to Kraken for distribution. ThisWasKraken
is relatively new to the dark web and is exclusively active on a
Russian criminal forum, where the actor registered on August 12,
2018. The actor communicates using Russian and English; however,
the analysis of their forum posts indicate that ThisWasKraken is
neither a native Russian nor English speaker. To make forum posts
in Russian, the actor likely uses automated translation services, as
is evident by the awkward phrasing indicative of such a service. In
contrast, the actor is noticeably more proficient in English, though
they make mistakes consistently in both sentence structure and
spelling.

It should be noted that the Kraken Cryptor ransomware is different from the Kraken
ransomware widely distributed in 2016, and is not linked to another ransomware strain
detected in 2013 that used the “.kraken” extension.

The Kraken Cryptor ransomware is not sold to users on a one-time
basis. It is instead operated as an affiliate program that distributes
builds of the ransomware to its participants, who in turn repay
a percentage of the income earned from ransom payments. This
technique of ransomware distribution, known as ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS), is commonly used on the dark web by cybercriminals
because of its efficiency. ThisWasKraken calls the service the Kraken
Cryptor v2 affiliate program, or Kraken ransomware-as-a-service,
which was last updated on October 21. The latest version of the
Kraken Cryptor is v.2.0.7.

At the time of this report, the Kraken Cryptor ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) required all potential affiliate partners to pay $50
per payload. Below are some of the terms and conditions of the
affiliate program:
• Affiliates receive 80 percent of the paid ransom.
• The program can reject any member or candidate without
explanation.
• Affiliates receive a 24/7 support service.
• Submitting Kraken sample files to antivirus services is
forbidden.
• The service provides no refunds for purchased payloads.

In addition to the countries listed above, the latest samples of
Kraken that have been identified in the wild no longer affect victims
in Syria, Brazil, and Iran, suggesting that ThisWasKraken (or their
associates) may have some connection to Brazil and Iran, though
this is not confirmed. It is likely that Syria was added following
the plea for help from a victim whose computer was infected by
another ransomware called GandCrab.
According to the map of infections provided below, we can still see
a minor level of infections in excluded countries, despite specific
fail-safe controls put in place by Kraken developers.
Each affiliate of Kraken Cryptor RaaS receives a unique build of
Kraken and must send the following information to ThisWasKraken
to be configured:
• A primary email address to communicate with victims
• An alternative email address to communicate with victims
• A ransom amount in Bitcoin, usually varying from 0.075 to
1.25 BTC
• A list of countries not to target
The analysis of the actor’s communication suggests that
ThisWasKraken is likely part of a team and not personally involved
in the development of the ransomware directly. The actor’s role is
customer facing, which is accomplished through the Jabber account
thiswaskraken@exploit[.]im. Communications with ThisWasKraken
show that the actor refers all technical issues to the product support
team at the email address teamxsupport@protonmail[.]com.

MALWARE PROFILE

Bitcoin is the only currency the affiliate program uses, and Insikt
Group identified several wallets associated with the operation.
Interestingly, it appears that Kraken's developers choose
BitcoinPenguin, an online gambling site, as the primary money
laundering conduit. Although not unusual, it is still very uncommon
for criminal actors — specifically ransomware operators — to depart
from more traditional cryptocurrency exchangers when laundering
stolen funds. It is likely that one of the decisive factors for this
unusual choice was due to the fact that BitcoinPenguin does not
require any identity verification of its members, allowing anyone to
maintain an anonymous cryptocurrency wallet there. Cryptocurrency
exchangers are continuing to stiffen their registration rules in
response to regulatory demands, but online crypto casinos do not
have to follow the same “know your customer” (KYC) guidelines,
providing a convenient loophole for all kinds of money launderers.

On October 4, 2018, BleepingComputer reported that the Fallout
exploit kit was being used to deliver the Kraken Cryptor ransomware
v.1.5. It should be noted that on multiple occasions, ThisWasKraken
mentioned the Fallout exploit kit and praised it for its high infection
rate. At one point, ThisWasKraken even stated, “One of our partners
joined the Fallout exploit kit, which is good for us.” Also, other
forum messages indicate that ThisWasKraken purchased hijacked
web traffic, which may be the same traffic responsible for Kraken
infections from the Fallout exploit kit.

Below are the technical specifications of the the Kraken Cryptor
ransomware v.2.0.7 posted by ThisWasKraken on October 21, 2018:
• The ransomware is written in C# (NET. Framework v. 3.5).
• The ransomware works offline and supports communication
via email.
• The size of the payload is around 85 KB, but antivirus analysis
indicates that the payload size often reaches up to 94 KB.
• Kraken primarily targets Windows OS versions 8, 8.1, and 10.
• Kraken has a high speed of encryption.
• There is no file size limit for encryption process.
• The ransomware collects system information when victims are
online.
• Kraken uses a hybrid encryption algorithm, including AES128/256 (CBC mode), as well as other ciphers (RSA, Salsa20,
RC4).

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 8

MALWARE PROFILE

• The ransomware uses a smart obfuscation encryption method
to target random positions of files, including network sharing
encryption.
• The ransomware encrypts storage devices on shared
networks.
• It is impossible to recover without paying the ransom.
• Anti-debugging and anti-forensics tools are included in the
package.
• Ransom messages are available in 15 languages in HTML and
TXT formats.
• “Canary trap” anti-ransomware bypass methods are applied to
identify key leaks.
• Infection statistics are based on IPs.
Affiliates are given a new build of Kraken every 15 days to keep the
payload fully undetectable (FUD) from antivirus software. According
to ThisWasKraken, when a victim asks for a free decryption test,
the affiliate member should send one of the victim’s files with
its associated unique key to the Kraken Cryptor ransomware
support service. The service will decrypt the file and resend it
to the affiliate member to forward to the victim. After the victim
pays the full ransom, the affiliate member sends 20 percent of
the received payment to the RaaS to get a decryptor key, which is
then forwarded on to the victim. This system ensures the affiliate
pays their percentage to the affiliate program and does not simply
pocket the full amount for themselves.
Technical Analysis
The following technical analysis was conducted by McAfee’s
Advanced Threat Research team and the results were shared with
Recorded Future.
The Kraken Cryptor ransomware encrypts data on the disk very
quickly and uses external tools, such as SDelete from the Sysinternals
Suite, to wipe files, making file recovery harder.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 9

MALWARE PROFILE

The Kraken Cryptor infection scheme through the Fallout exploit kit.

The ransomware implements a user account control (UAC) bypass
using the Windows Event Viewer. This bypass technique is used by
other malware families and is quite effective for executing malware.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 10

MALWARE PROFILE

The ransomware uses Windows Event Viewer to bypass UAC.

The technique is well explained in an article by blogger enigma0x3.
McAfee analyzed an early subset of Kraken ransomware samples
and determined that they were still in the testing phase, adding and
removing options. The ransomware implemented a “protection” to
delete itself during the infection phase:
• C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3 >
NUL&&del /Q /F /S
• C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\
krakentemp0000.exe
This step is to prevent researchers and endpoint protections from
catching the file on an infected machine.
Kraken encrypts user files with a random name and drops the
ransom note demanding that the victim pay to recover them. Each
file extension is different; this technique is often used by specific
ransomware families to bypass endpoint protection systems.
Kraken, delivered by the exploit kit, bypasses the UAC using Event
Viewer, drops a file on the system, and executes it through the UAC
bypass method.

Later versions “dropped” the PDB path together with the Kraken
loader.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 12

MALWARE PROFILE

Using Sysinternals Tools for Harder File Recovery
One unique feature of this ransomware family is the use of SDelete.
Kraken uses a .bat file to perform certain operations, making file
recovery much more challenging:

Kraken Cryptor v.1.6 with SDelete bat file makes file recovery harder.

Kraken downloads SDelete from the Sysinternals website, adds the
registry key, accepting the EULA to avoid the pop up, and executes
it with the following arguments:
sdelete.exe -c -z C
The SDelete batch file makes file recovery much harder by
overwriting all free space on the drive with zeros, deleting the
Volume Shadow Copies, disabling the recovery reboot option, and
finally, rebooting the system after 300 seconds.

Netguid Comparison
Earlier versions of Kraken were delivered by a loader before it
moved to a direct execution method. The loader we examined
contained a specific netguid. With this, McAfee found additional
samples of the Kraken loader on VirusTotal:

Not only did the loader have a specific netguid, but the compiled
versions of Kraken also shared a netguid, making it possible to
continue hunting samples:

Additional hash values detected.

Comparing Versions
Kraken uses a configuration file in every version to set the variables
for the ransomware. This file is easily extracted for additional
analysis.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 14

MALWARE PROFILE

Image of the configuration file of Kraken Cryptor.

Based on the configuration file, McAfee discovered nine versions
of Kraken:
• 1.2
• 1.3
• 1.5
• 1.5.2
• 1.5.3
• 1.6
• 2.0
• 2.0.4
• 2.0.7
By extracting the configuration files from all of the versions, McAfee
built the following overview of features (the checkmark means the
feature is present):

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-1030 | 15

MALWARE PROFILE

All of the versions we examined mostly contain the same options,
differing only in some of the anti-virtual protection and antiforensic capabilities. The latest version, Kraken 2.0.7, changed its
configuration scheme and is covered later.
Other differences in Kraken’s configuration file include the list of
countries excluded from encryption. The standouts are Brazil and
Syria, which were not named in the original forum advertisement.
Having an exclusion list is a common method for cybercriminals to
avoid prosecution. Brazil’s addition to the list in Version 1.5 suggests
the involvement of a Brazilian affiliate. The following table shows
the exclusion list by country and version (the checkmark means the
country appears on the list):

Exclusion list by country and version indicates the list of countries that are not allowed to attack.

All of the Kraken releases have excluded the same countries, except
for Brazil, Iran, and Syria.2
McAfee believes that the creators of Kraken had the same change of heart as the actors
behind GandCrab, who recently released decryption keys for Syrian victims after a tweet
claimed they had no money to pay the ransoms.

MALWARE PROFILE

Insikt Group was able to obtain a sample of the Kraken Cryptor
ransomware and successfully encrypt and then decrypt a 64-bit
Windows 7 machine. The encryption phase locked all target files,
and, in those directories, placed a ransom note in HTML format
with instructions for the victim. The note first instructs the victim to
buy Bitcoin through LocalBitcoins.com or BestBitcoinExchange.io,
and then to contact the primary or secondary email address listed
for further instructions. Obviously, the infected machine still has
access to its web browsers, so the victim can communicate with the
attacker and pay the ransom.

Partial screenshot of the ransom note left by Kraken.

When the victim pays the ransom, they receive an email containing a
link for the file-sharing service Uploadfiles.io that in turn downloads
two files, Decryptor.exe and Private.txt. Private.txt contains two
datasets: a private key and a private IV. When the program Decryptor.
exe is executed, it requires the victim to copy and paste the private
key and private IV into the respective fields in order to decrypt the
files on their machine.

Outlook
The Kraken Cryptor ransomware is a 32-bit malware written using
.NET Framework and protected with SmartAssembly, a commercial
obfuscator that protects an application against reverse engineering.
The malware is fully customizable through a JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) file that is likely generated by its builder.
The existence of the list of countries that are not allowed to be
targeted indicates that the members of this possible international
hacking group may reside in these nations. Such behavior is usually
considered as a security step by the criminals who do not want
to be searched by local law enforcement agencies. Considering
that ThisWasKraken is not a native English or Russian speaker, the
possible residence of the actor may be Brazil or Iran.
