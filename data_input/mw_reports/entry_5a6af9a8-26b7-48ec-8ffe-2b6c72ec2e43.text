Deep Dive Into HERMES Ransomware
vxhive.blogspot.com/2020/11/deep-dive-into-hermes-ransomware.html

Quick Overview:
HERMES is a Ransomware which spreads by spear-phising emails. It was
first detected on October 2017. Its attributed to the Lazurus APT group it
has high connections to Ryuk Ransomware and its believed that they are
written by the same author. Among most Ransomwares, it's common that
it encrypts the files using AES and Encrypts the AES Random Key using
RSA , in the upcoming parts we will include some more insights into it.

In Depth-Reversing:
. HERMES Drops A Copy From its Self under Name "svchosta.exe" in the
Temp Folder

And it executes using this command

Inhibit System Recovery:
. Similarly like most ransomwares it deletes shadow copies to acheive this
it drops a batch file similar to the Ryuk one , which strengthens it's
similarity to Ryuk

1/17

And it executes using this command

Unpacking and API Resolving:
HERMES allocates a section in memory for the unpacked PE file , this
technique can be defined as Self Injection . This image explains it very well
& quick , credits goes to OALabs for the fantastic explanation

What we need to do is to fire up the debugger and put 2 break points on:

2/17

[+] VirtualAlloc
[+] VirtualProtect

While setting a breakpoint on VirtualAlloc() , make sure to press execute
till return , the return value of VirtualAlloc() is stored in EAX so Right click
on it and follow in dump

Now Press F9 Again

Yay! A Nice PE File. Now Just follow in memory map and dump the file :)
While opening the file in PE Studio on imports , but sadly there are just 5
imports :( , so there must be a function that should resolve those imports.

Now let's Fire Up IDA. Go to the imports Click "X" on LoadLibraryA to see
where its called.

3/17

Go for the First One..
And Bingo We Found it :)

4/17

So It looks like its passing the API to a decryption or deobfsucation
function. Now Just take this Address and and set a Break Point on it. when
u break on it click execute till return. U may found sth! ECX holds our API.

5/17

So Now Right Click on ECX and Follow in Dump U must find all the APIs

Now we have 3 choices first one is to dump the file using scylla, second is
to rename the imports manually and third is to write a script. will leave it
as an excercise for u ;)

Mutex Creation:
HERMES Creates a Mutex with the name "tech". As U Can See the APIs
related to mutex's are dynamiclly resolved.

U may ask what is a mutex and why does the malware uses it ?. So let me
explain. First What is a Mutex is an object that allows mutliple threads to
share the same resource but in order. as shown in the figure:

6/17

complicated right ? so let me explain why we need mutexes, when u have
two threads sharing the same resource say if the Thread "A" Reads From
this Resource and Thread "B" Writes to this resource this resource maybe
anything like a file for example. This Behavior is Called "Race Condition"
this must not happens because if Thread "B" Writes to the File for ex
Thread "A" will get corrupted data. So we need a Mechanism to scheduale
this behavior and that's what a mutex is a mutex aquires a lock for the
Thread this says oh ok now Thread "A" for ex u have the ability to read or
write to the file or any other operation and Thread "B" Cannot Do any
operation on that file before Thread "A" Releases This Lock or Mutex and
It will be given to Thread "B". ok but u may also ask so also how all of this
story relates to malware. ok malware uses mutexes for mutiple things one
of them is not infecting the host twice.

Language Checks:
HERMES Checks for the System language. Every language on this planet
has a code this code is just a number for example 0409 is the code for
english. The code of the system language can be found under the a registry
key:
[+]
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Lang

As u can see the third value is the system language code. now lets see how
it utlizes this feature.

7/17

It opens the Registry key I mentioned above and then it queries the value
of InstallLanguage and Compares it with three values:
[+] 0419 --> Russian
[+] 0422 --> Ukrainian
[+] 0423 --> Belarusian

And if it matches it exits the process (malware) using ExitProcess.

8/17

U may ask why this is important well this might be important in targetted
attacks so it looks like it didn't want to target those countries. so luckily
these three countires won't get infected ;). Read this for more info Malware

Percistance:
HERMES Achieves Percistance by Dropping the "start.bat" batchfile in the
startup folder to start the malware every time the computer starts why ??
doesn't it encrypt the files and everything is fine ? ok but what if it missed a
file or if u have new files

It Drops this batch file in the StartUp Folder. The StartUp Folder in it the
programs that are executed automaticly every time the user logs in or when
the computer starts.

9/17

And U Simply Can Disable this File or simply delete it from the start folder.
If U tried restarting the VM u will see the command being executed but it
didn't

Encryption:
HERMES Encrypts The Files using AES-256 Algorithm and Encrypts the
AES Random Key with RSA, And It utlizes the Windows CryptAPI.

It uses:
[+] CryptEncrypt
[+] CryptGenKey
[+] CryptExportKey
[+] CryptImportKey
[+] CryptAcquireContextW

. It Drops two Files used for Encryption "PUBLIC" and
"UNIQUE_ID_DONT_REMOVE".

The First one is a Public RSA Blob. These Blobs are used to store RSA
Public Keys.

10/17

And the second one is the private key which means its for the attacker only
and its encrypted. Take alook at the first 8 bytes from offset 0 to 7 actually
these bytes has great meaning the 0x7 means that its a private key blob,
0x2 is the blob version and 0xA400 is the algorithm so this will tell that its
RSA or any other algorithm for our case its RSA.

HERMES Uses "HERMES" Marker at the end of the file to identify if the
file is encrypted or not

11/17

by CodeAnalysis it uses ReadFile and Checks for the marker as shown here

It Generates a AES-256 Key

12/17

HERMES Encrypts the File in chunks it reads the files and Encrypts it
1000000 bytes each

HERMES Does Some Drive Checking using GetLogicalDrives() and
GetDriveType()

13/17

It First Gets the Drives on the Systems and Then Calls to GetDriveType If
Return value of it is 5 means its (CD-ROM) it skips it.
It Also Skips Some Folders
