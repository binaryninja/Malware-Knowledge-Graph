Summary
Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated activities associated with
Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390). Analysis of TG-3390's operations, targeting, and tools led CTU
researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the People's Republic of
China. The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other
industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations. The group
extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to
deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its
tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger.
CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about TG-3390 into two sections: strategic and
tactical. Strategic threat intelligence includes an assessment of the ongoing threat posed by the
threat group. Executives can use this assessment to determine how to reduce risk to their
organization's mission and critical assets. Tactical threat intelligence is based on incident response
investigations and research, and is mapped to the kill chain. Computer network defenders can use
this information to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to TG-3390.

CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that TG-3390 is based in the
People's Republic of China.
CTU researchers have evidence that the threat group compromised U.S. and UK
organizations in the following verticals: manufacturing (specifically aerospace
(including defense contractors), automotive, technology, energy, and
pharmaceuticals), education, and legal, as well as organizations focused on
international relations. Based on analysis of the group's SWCs, TG-3390
operations likely affect organizations in other countries and verticals.
TG-3390 operates a broad and long-running campaign of SWCs and has
compromised approximately 100 websites as of this publication. Through an IP
address whitelisting process, the threat group selectively targets visitors to these
websites.
After the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to its
victims. The threat actors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft Exchange
servers and to gain complete control of the target environment.

Organizations for Cyberespionage

Figure 1. Threat is based on a threat group's intent and capability. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Intent
CTU researchers infer intent by aggregating observations, analyzing a threat group's activity, and
placing the information in a wider context.
Like many threat groups, TG-3390 conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as
watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the target organization's vertical or demographic
to increase the likelihood of finding victims with relevant information. CTU researchers assess with
high confidence that TG-3390 uses information gathered from prior reconnaissance activities to
selectively compromise users who visit websites under its control. Most websites compromised by
TG-3390 actors are affiliated with five types of organizations around the world:

large manufacturing companies, particularly those supplying defense
organizations
energy companies
embassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East, Europe,
and Asia, likely to target U.S.-based users involved in international relations
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), particularly those focused on
international relations and defense
government organizations
Based on this information, CTU researchers assess that TG-3390 aims to collect defense technology
and capability intelligence, other industrial intelligence, and political intelligence from governments
and NGOs.
Attribution
To assess attribution, CTU researchers analyze observed activity, third-party reporting, and
contextual intelligence. For the following reasons, CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence
that TG-3390 has a Chinese nexus:

The SWC of a Uyghur cultural website suggests intent to target the Uyghur ethnic
group, a Muslim minority group primarily found in the Xinjiang region of China.
Threat groups outside of China are unlikely to target the Uyghur people.
TG-3390 uses the PlugX remote access tool. The menus for PlugX's server-side
component are written exclusively in Standard Chinese (Mandarin), suggesting
that PlugX operators are familiar with this language.
CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 activity between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC,
which is 12:00 to 17:00 local time in China (UTC +8). The timeframe maps to the
second half of the workday in China.
The threat actors have used the Baidu search engine, which is only available in
Chinese, to conduct reconnaissance activities.
CTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about
specific U.S. defense projects that would be desirable to those operating within a
country with a manufacturing base, an interest in U.S. military capability, or both.
CTU researchers recognize that the evidence supporting this attribution is circumstantial. It is
possible that TG-3390 is false-flag operation by a threat group outside of China that is deliberately
planting indications of a Chinese origin.
Capability
To assess a threat group's capability, CTU researchers analyze its resources, technical proficiency,
and tradecraft.
Resources
TG-3390 has access to proprietary tools, some of which are used exclusively by TG-3390 and others
that are shared among a few Chinese threat groups. The complexity and continual development of
these tools indicates a mature development process. TG-3390 can quickly leverage compromised
network infrastructure during an operation and can conduct simultaneous intrusions into multiple
environments. This ability is further demonstrated by analysis of interactions between TG-3390
operators and a target environment. CTU researchers found no evidence of multiple operators
working simultaneously against a single organization. This efficiency of operation (a 1:1 ratio of
operator to observed activity) suggests that TG-3390 can scale to conduct the maximum number of
simultaneous operations. These characteristics suggest that the threat group is well resourced and
has access to a tools development team and a team focused on SWCs.
Technical proficiency
TG-3390's obfuscation techniques in SWCs complicate detection of malicious web traffic redirects.
Malware used by the threat group can be configured to bypass network-based detection; however,
the threat actors rarely modify host-based configuration settings when deploying payloads. CTU
researchers have observed the threat actors installing a credential logger and backdoor on Microsoft
Exchange servers, which requires a technical grasp of Internet Information Services (IIS). TG-3390
uses older exploits to compromise targets, and CTU researchers have not observed the threat actors
using zero-day exploits as of this publication. The threat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt
when reentering a network after an eviction, overcoming technical barriers constructed by network
defenders.
Tradecraft
In addition to using SWCs to target specific types of organizations, TG-3390 uses spearphishing
emails to target specific victims. CTU researchers assess with high confidence that the threat actors
follow an established playbook during an intrusion. They quickly move away from their initial access
vector to hide their entry point and then target Exchange servers as a new access vector. As of this
publication, CTU researchers have not discovered how TG-3390 keeps track of the details associated
with its compromised assets and credentials. However, the threat actors' ability to reuse these

E

D

assets and credentials, sometimes weeks or months after the initial compromise, indicates the
group is disciplined and well organized. After gaining access to a target network in one intrusion
analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identified and exfiltrated data for specific projects run
by the target organization, indicating that they successfully obtained the information they sought.
Data exfiltration occurred almost four weeks after the initial compromise and continued for two
weeks (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Data exfiltration timeline. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Note: The adversary's end goal is to exfiltrate, not infiltrate. Organizations often miss multiple
opportunities to detect and disrupt the threat actors before they can achieve their objective.
Alerts for credential theft tools and privileged account lockouts should be investigated.
Tactical threat intelligence
Known tools
CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors using tools that are favored by multiple threat
groups:

PlugX — A remote access tool notable for communications that may contain HTTP
headers starting with "X-" (e.g., "X-Session: 0"). Its presence on a compromised
system allows a threat actor to execute a wide variety of commands, including
uploading and downloading files, and spawning a reverse shell. The malware can
be configured to use multiple network protocols to avoid network-based detection.
DLL side loading is often used to maintain persistence on the compromised
system.
HttpBrowser (also known as TokenControl) — A backdoor notable for HTTPS
communications with the HttpBrowser/1.0 User-Agent (see Figure 3).
HttpBrowser's executable code may be obfuscated through structured exception
handling and return-oriented programming. Its presence on a compromised
system allows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download files,
and capture keystrokes. Antivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and
is typically based upon heuristic signatures. DLL side loading has been used to
maintain persistence on the compromised system. More information about
HttpBrowser is available in Appendix B.

Figure 3. HttpBrowser URI. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
ChinaChopper web shell — A web-based executable script (see Figure 4) that
allows a threat actor to execute commands on the compromised system. The
server-side component provides a simple graphical user interface for threat actors
interacting with web shells.

Figure 4. ChinaChopper web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Passwords, like "admin-na-google123!@#" shown in Figure 4, are required to
interact with the web shell. TG-3390 has used additional web shells containing
similarly formatted passwords.
Hunter — A web application scanning tool written by @tojen to identify
vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, and Adobe
ColdFusion (see Figure 5). It can also identify open ports, collect web banners,
and download secondary files.

Figure 5. Hunter usage. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
The following tools appear to be exclusive to TG-3390:

OwaAuth web shell — A web shell and credential stealer deployed to Microsoft
Exchange servers. It is installed as an ISAPI filter. Captured credentials are DESencrypted using the password "12345678" and are written to the log.txt file in
the root directory. Like the ChinaChopper web shell, the OwaAuth web shell
requires a password. However, the OwaAuth web shell password contains the
victim organization's name. More information about the OwaAuth web shell is
available in Appendix C.
ASPXTool — A modified version of the ASPXSpy web shell (see Figure 6). It is
deployed to internally accessible servers running Internet Information Services
(IIS).

Figure 6. ASPXTool web shell. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
TG-3390 actors have also used the following publicly available tools:

Windows Credential Editor (WCE) — obtains passwords from memory
gsecdump — obtains passwords from memory
winrar — compresses data for exfiltration
nbtscan — scans NetBIOS name servers
Tactics, techniques, and procedures
Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the tactics TG-3390
employs during intrusions.
Reconnaissance
CTU researchers have not observed TG-3390 actors performing reconnaissance prior to
compromising organizations. As discussed in the Actions on objectives section, the threat actors
appear to wait until they have established a foothold.
Development
TG-3390 actors use command and control (C2) domains for extended periods of time but frequently
change the domains' IP addresses. The new IP addresses are typically on the same subnet as the
previous ones.
TG-3390 is capable of using a C2 infrastructure that spans multiple networks and registrars. The
most common registrar used by the adversary is HiChina Zhicheng Technology Ltd. The threat actors
have a demonstrated ability to move from one network provider to another, using some
infrastructure for extended periods of time and other domains for only a few days. Seemingly
random activity patterns in infrastructure deployment and usage, along with the ability to use a
wide variety of geographically diverse infrastructure, help the threat actors avoid detection.
TG-3390 SWCs may be largely geographically independent, but the group's most frequently used C2
registrars and IP net blocks are located in the U.S. Using a U.S.-based C2 infrastructure (see Figure
7) to compromise targets in the U.S. helps TG-3390 actors avoid geo-blocking and geo-flagging
measures used in network defense.

Figure 7. Geolocation of TG-3390 infrastructure observed by CTU researchers. The dark green
signifies a high count of C2 registrars and IP net blocks, while the light green represents a smaller
count. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
The threat actors create PlugX DLL stub loaders that will run only after a specific date. The compile
dates of the samples analyzed by CTU researchers are all later than the hard-coded August 8, 2013
date, indicating that the code might be reused from previous tools.
The OwaAuth web shell is likely created with a builder, given that the PE compile time of the binary
does not change between instances and the configuration fields are padded to a specific size. The
adversaries modify publicly available tools such as ASPXSpy to remove identifying characteristics
that network defenders use to identify web shells.
Weaponization
As of this publication, CTU researchers are unsure if TG-3390 relies on weaponizers to package tools
and exploits.
Delivery
TG-3390 conducts SWCs or sends spearphishing emails with ZIP archive attachments. The ZIP
archives have names relevant to the targets and contain both legitimate files and malware. One
archive sample analyzed by CTU researchers contained a legitimate PDF file, a benign image of
interest to targets (see Figure 8), and an HttpBrowser installer disguised as an image file.

Figure 8. Decoy image. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)

In SWCs analyzed by CTU researchers, the threat actors added the Dean Edwards packed JavaScript
code shown in Figure 9 to the end of a legitimate website's menu page.

Figure 9. SWC code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
As shown in Figure 10, the unpacked JavaScript code reveals an iframe pointing to an IP address
that is hosting the exploit.

Figure 10. Unpacked JavaScript code. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Both the redirect code on the compromised site and the exploit code appear and disappear,
indicating that the adversaries add the code when they want to leverage the SWC and remove the
code when it is not in use to limit the visibility of their operations. The threat actors have evolved to
whitelisting IP addresses and only delivering the exploit and payload to specific targets of interest.
CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 compromising a target organization's externally and
internally accessible assets, such as an OWA server, and adding redirect code to point internal users
to an external website that hosts an exploit and delivers malware.
Exploitation
TG-3390 actors have used Java exploits in their SWCs. In particular, the threat actors have exploited
CVE-2011-3544, a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment, to deliver the HttpBrowser
backdoor; and CVE-2010-0738, a vulnerability in JBoss, to compromise internally and externally
accessible assets used to redirect users' web browsers to exploit code.
In activity analyzed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 executed the Hunter web application scanning
tool against a target server running IIS. Hunter queried the following URIs in a specific order to
determine if the associated software configurations are insecure, and all queries contained the
HttpClient User-Agent:

GET /manager/html/ — Tomcat web application manager
GET /jmx-console/ — JBoss configuration
GET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm — ColdFusion configuration
Installation
TG-3390 uses DLL side loading, a technique that involves running a legitimate, typically digitally
signed, program that loads a malicious DLL. CTU researchers have observed the threat actors
employing legitimate Kaspersky antivirus variants in analyzed samples. The DLL acts as a stub
loader, which loads and executes the shell code. The adversaries have used this technique to allow
PlugX and HttpBrowser to persist on a system.
Note: DLL side loading is a prevalent persistence technique that is used to launch a multitude of
backdoors. The challenge is detecting known good software loading and running malware. As
security controls have improved, DLL side loading has evolved to load a payload stored in a
different directory or from a registry value.
In other cases, threat actors placed web shells on externally accessible servers, sometimes behind a
reverse proxy, to execute commands on the compromised system. TG-3390 actors have deployed
the OwaAuth web shell to Exchange servers, disguising it as an ISAPI filter. The IIS w3wp.exe
process loads the malicious DLL, which CTU researchers have observed in the Program
Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\ClientAccess\Owa\Bin directory.
Command and control
To traverse the firewall, C2 traffic for most TG-3390 tools occurs over ports 53, 80, and 443. The
PlugX malware can be configured to use HTTP, DNS, raw TCP, or UDP to avoid network-based
detection. In one sample analyzed by CTU researchers, PlugX was configured with hard-coded user
credentials to bypass a proxy that required authentication. Newer HttpBrowser versions use SSL
with self-signed certificates to encrypt network communications.
TG-3390 actors frequently change the C2 domain's A record to point to the loopback IP address
127.0.0.1, which is a variation of a technique known as "parking." Other variations of parking point
the IP address to Google's recursive name server 8.8.8.8, an address belonging to Confluence, or to
other non-routable addresses. When the adversaries' operations are live, they modify the record
again to point the C2 domain to an IP address they can access. A domain name parking example is
available in Appendix D.
Actions on objective
CTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations, including how the
adversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. As shown in Figure 11, after
compromising an initial victim's system (patient 0), the threat actors use the Baidu search engine to
search for the victim's organization name. They then identify the Exchange server and attempt to
install the OwaAuth web shell. If the OwaAuth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses twofactor authentication for webmail, the adversaries identify other externally accessible servers and
deploy ChinaChopper web shells. Within six hours of entering the environment, the threat actors
compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for the entire domain.

Figure 11. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's initial entry into a victim's network. (Source: Dell
SecureWorks)

The threat actors use the Hunter and nbtscan tools, sometimes renamed, to conduct network
reconnaissance for vulnerable servers and online systems (see Figure 12). TG-3390 actors favor
At.exe to create scheduled tasks for executing commands on remote systems.

Figure 12. nbtscan batch script (renamed ipcan.exe) used to profile network. (Source: Dell
SecureWorks)
Over a few days' span, the threat actors install remote access tools on additional systems based
upon the results of the network reconnaissance. They use At.exe to schedule tasks to run selfextracting RAR archives, which install either HttpBrowser or PlugX. CTU researchers observed the
threat actors collecting Cisco VPN profiles to use when accessing the victim's network via VPN (see
Figure 13).

Figure 13. Copying of .pcf files. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
To facilitate lateral movement, the adversaries deploy ASPXTool web shells to internally accessible
systems running IIS.
CTU researchers have observed the threat actors encrypting data using the password "adminwindows2014" and splitting the RAR archives into parts in the recycler directory, with the same
name as the uncompressed data (see Figure 14).

Figure 14. Batch script used to archive data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
The number at the end of the password corresponds to the year of the intrusion. For example, the
password "admin-windows2014" shown in Figure 14 was changed to "admin-windows2015" for TG3390 intrusions conducted in 2015.
Note: CTU researchers frequently observe threat actors renaming archiving tools and storing data
for exfiltration in uncommon directories. In some instances, adversaries exceed disk space limits
during the exfiltration process, requiring the staging of archives on multiple systems. Unexplained
disk quota alerts on typically underutilized systems warrants immediate investigation.
Another batch script run by a scheduled task renames the archives on the file server (see Figure
15).

Figure 15. Batch script used to rename exfiltrated data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors staging RAR archives, renamed with a .zip file
extension, on externally accessible web servers. The adversaries then issue HTTP GET requests,
sometimes with the User-Agent MINIXL, to exfiltrate the archive parts from the victim's network
(see Figure 16).

Figure 16. Example GET request from IIS log. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
In other intrusions, data was exfiltrated using the PlugX remote access tool. Figure 17 shows
network data transfer sizes for a month-long period beginning with TG-3390's re-entry into a
network. Approximately 300 GB of data was exfiltrated during that span.

CTU observations
Figure 18 is a UTC time wheel depicting which hours the threat actors actively operated in one
target environment during a three-day intrusion observed by CTU researchers. The concentric bands
represent the days of the week, with Saturday as the outside band and Sunday as the innermost
band, and each cell represents an hour. The darker the cell color, the higher the activity level; white
indicates no observed activity. TG-3390 was most active between 04:00 and 09:00 UTC.

CTU researchers. The legend across the bottom of the figure lists the upper bound of interactions
that are represented by each color variation on the wheel. Times are based on UTC. (Source: Dell
SecureWorks)
Response to eviction
Successfully evicting TG-3390 from an environment requires a coordinated plan to remove all access
points, including remote access tools and web shells. Within weeks of eviction, the threat actors
attempt to access their ChinaChopper web shells from previously used IP addresses. Finding the
web shells inaccessible, the adversaries search google.co.jp for remote access solutions. CTU
researchers discovered the threat actors searching for "[company] login," which directed them to
the landing page for remote access. TG-3390 attempts to reenter the environment by identifying
accounts that do not require two-factor authentication for remote access solutions, and then brute
forcing usernames and passwords. After reestablishing access, the adversaries download tools such
as gsecudmp and WCE that are staged temporarily on websites that TG-3390 previously
compromised but never used. CTU researchers believe legitimate websites are used to host tools
because web proxies categorize the sites as benign.
Note: Numerous threat groups use legitimate remote access solutions (VPN, Citrix, OWA, etc.) to
enter or reenter a network. After executing an eviction plan, it is paramount to reset all
credentials, including those for third-party accounts, preferably after implementing two-factor
authentication.
TG-3390 actors keep track of and leverage existing ASPXTool web shells in their operations,
preferring to issue commands via an internally accessible web shell rather than HttpBrowser or
PlugX. After reentering an environment, the threat actors focus on obtaining the active directory
contents. Figure 19 shows a timeline of TG-3390 attempting to regain a foothold in a network in a
span of only five hours.

Figure 19. Timeline, in Eastern Time, of TG-3390's reentry into a compromised network. (Source:
Dell SecureWorks)
Note: Relying primarily on network-based security controls will not deter most threat groups from
achieving their objective. Adversaries can overcome blacklisted infrastructure in minutes, as TG3390 actors did when they staged tools on compromised web servers.
Team member or team identifier
Analysis of the OwaAuth web shell revealed a PDB string with the "SyberSpace" username (see
Figure 20).

Figure 20. OwaAuth web shell PDB string. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
Further research revealed additional tools containing the same username (see Figure 21).

Figure 21. PDB strings containing the 'SyberSpace' username. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)
CTU researchers have no evidence to determine if these tools are also used by TG-3390.
Conclusion
TG-3390 is known for compromising organizations via SWCs and moving quickly to install backdoors
on Exchange servers. Despite the group's proficiency, there are still many opportunities to detect
and disrupt its operation by studying its modus operandi . The threat actors work to overcome
existing security controls, or those put in place during an engagement, to complete their mission of
exfiltrating intellectual property. Due to TG-3390's determination, organizations should formulate a
solid eviction plan before engaging with the threat actors to prevent them from reentering the
network.

Table 1. TG-3390 indicators.
Appendix A — Identifying attribution and gauging confidence
Identifying attribution
In most cases, CTU researchers not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat group, so
attribution relies on circumstantial evidence and is an assessment rather than a fact. CTU
researchers draw on three distinct intelligence bases for evidence of attribution:

Observed activity is gathered from CTU researchers' observation and investigation
of a threat group's activity on a target network and across Dell SecureWorks data,
and analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the threat group
employs.
Third-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the security
industry and with other private and public sector organizations, as well as analysis
of open source intelligence.
Contextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence
requirements of nation states and other threat actors and compares tradecraft
employed by a threat group to tradecraft of known threat actors.
Gauging confidence level
CTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S. Office of the Director of
National Intelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:

High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality
information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid
judgment. A "high confidence" judgment is not a fact or a certainty, however, and
such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.
Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced
and plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a
higher level of confidence.
Low confidence generally means that the information's credibility and/or
plausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or poorly
corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that [there are] significant
concerns or problems with the sources.
Appendix B — HttpBrowser analysis
HttpBrowser is a remote access tool whose name originates from the hard-coded "HttpBrowser/1.0"
User-Agent. CTU researchers also identified a PDB string in the binaries,
J:\TokenControlV3\ServerDll\Release\ServerDll.pdb, which implies that the threat actors may refer
to the tool as "TokenControl." Table 2 lists the commands available to threat actors in one of the
HttpBrowser variants.

Appendix C — OwaAuth web shell analysis
OwaAuth is a web shell that is installed as an ISAPI filter on Exchange servers and shares

characteristics with the ChinaChopper web shell. Like ChinaChopper, it parses HTTP requests for the
Z1 and Z2 parameters (see Table 4). The legitimate owaauth.dll file resides in
%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange Server\ClientAccess\Owa\Auth\ while CTU researchers have
observed the backdoor using the same filename in the %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\ClientAccess\Owa\bin\ directory. In addition to acting as a web shell, the malware captures
and DES-encrypts credentials before writing the username and password to disk. The OwaAuth web
shell enables a threat actor to upload and download files, launch processes, and execute SQL
queries.
Each web shell instance is configured to contain SP, Key, and Log variables. The SP variable is a
string containing the victim's username. When the malicious ISAPI filter captures a username
matching this variable, it knows to handle the incoming HTTP request as a command to the web
shell. The DES key to encrypt the credentials in the configuration observed by CTU researchers is
12345678, and the log file is c:\log.txt. The decrypted contents of the log file adhere to the format
in Figure 22.

Appendix D — Domain name parking example
CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 parking domains by pointing their A record to a nonroutable IP space, including the 127.0.0.[x] loopback address. Table 5 demonstrates how the threat
actors change one of their C2 domains to point to routable and non-routable IP addresses over
time.

Endnotes
[1] The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) research team tracks threat groups by
assigning them four-digit randomized numbers (3390 in this case), and compiles information from
first-hand incident response observations and from external sources.
[2] Threat groups use strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, to
target a wide array of potential victims. Threat actors compromise a website used by their target
demographic (e.g., compromising a website specializing in oil and gas industry news when targeting
the energy vertical). Visitors to the compromised website are redirected to a server under the threat
group's control, where their system is compromised with the threat group's malware. With this
tactic, a threat group increases the likelihood of compromising systems that possess desired
information.
