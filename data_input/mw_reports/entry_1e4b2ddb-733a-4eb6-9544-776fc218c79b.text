Taiwanese laptop maker Compal Electronics suffered a DoppelPaymer ransomware attack
over the weekend, with the attackers demanding an almost $17 million ransom.
Compal is the second-largest original design manufacturer (ODM) of laptops globally, with
well-known companies rebranding their devices or designs, including Apple, HP, Dell,
Lenovo, and Acer.

$16.7 million ransom demanded
Over the weekend, Taiwanese media reported that Compal suffered a cyberattack, but the
laptop maker claimed it was just an "abnormality" in their office automation system.

"Lu Qingxiong said that the main reason was an abnormality in the office automation
system. The company suspected of being invaded by hackers. It has urgently repaired most
of it and is expected to return to normal today,"
"Lu Qingxiong emphasized that Compal is not being blackmailed by hackers, as is reported
by the outside world, and everything is currently normal in production," UDN reported.
Since then, BleepingComputer has confirmed that Compal suffered a DoppelPaymer
ransomware attack after we obtained a ransom note used in the attack.

Compal ransom note
DoppelPaymer is a ransomware operation known for attacking enterprise targets by gaining
access to admin credentials and using them to spread throughout a Windows network.
Once they gain access to a Windows domain controller, they deploy the ransomware
payloads to all devices on the network.
According to the DoppelPaymer Tor payment site linked to in the ransom note, the
ransomware gang is demanding 1,100 Bitcoins, or $16,725,500.00 at today's prices, to
receive a decryptor.

DoppelPaymer ransom demand
According to the ransom note and DoppelPaymer's past history, the attackers likely stole
unencrypted data as part of their attack.
This stolen data is then used as a double-extortion strategy where the ransomware gangs
threaten to release the files on data leak sites if a ransom is not paid.
It should be noted that the initial ransom demands are a "starting" price and are commonly
negotiated to a significantly lower amount for victims who decide to pay the ransom.
Other victims attacked by DoppelPaymer in the past include PEMEX (Petróleos
Mexicanos), the City of Torrance in California, Newcastle University, Hall County in Georgia,
and Bretagne Télécom.
