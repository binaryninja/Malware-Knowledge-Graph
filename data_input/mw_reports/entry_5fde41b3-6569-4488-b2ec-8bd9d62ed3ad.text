Executive Summary
On July 10, 2020, according to Advanced Intelligence's Vitali Kremez, it was revealed
that sandboxed TrickBot banking malware activity related to the distribution group_tag
"chil48" loaded a rather newer mysterious test module, known as "grabber.dll".

1/4

The module version "0.6.8" is meant for browser stealer activity affecting Google
Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge as well as browser cookies.
The module immediately alerted the victim machine of the fraud by opening the
browser with the alert message.
Advanced Intelligence assesses with high confidence that this module was likely a test
module deployed mistakenly alerting on the malware activity during the testing phase.
Possible recommendations and mitigation steps include immediate disconnect and
forensic investigation of the affected machines.
Background
On July 10, 2020, according to Advanced Intelligence's Vitali Kremez, it was revealed that
sandboxed TrickBot banking malware activity related to the distribution group_tag "chil48"
loaded a rather mysterious module, known as "grabber.dll". The module version "0.6.8" is
meant for browser stealer activity affecting Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla
Firefox, Microsoft Edge as well as browser cookies.

The signed malware sample that led to the discovery was originally found by
MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam).

Discovery: New "grabber.dll" Test Module
Strangely enough, the module immediately alerted the victim machine of the fraud by
opening the browser with the message:
The malware development module references a plethora of internal C++ code references
such as "grabchrome.cpp." The module itself references the usual TrickBot grabber code
patterns and functions.

Notably, the malware contains the detailed verbose functionality prompt:
Assessment: TrickBot Group Distribution Mistake?

Advanced Intelligence assesses with high confidence that this module was likely a test
module deployed mistakenly alerting on the malware activity during the testing phase due to
the typical TrickBot module code patterns. Based on our assessment, it is hypothesized If
developed by an outsider coder, this test module possibly reveals the nature of the TrickBot
operations as leveraging coders with hiring coders under the ruse of legitimate anti-malware
activity development.

As part of the chain, Advanced Intelligence discovered another rather unusually named
module "socksbot.dll." This module is meant for Socks5 proxy activity of the TrickBot chain.

We continue closely monitoring for TrickBot activity and malware distributions.
