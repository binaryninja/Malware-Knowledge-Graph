With the high ransom prices and big payouts of enterprise-targeting ransomware, we now
have another ransomware known as Mailto or Netwalker that is compromising enterprise
networks and encrypting all of the Windows devices connected to it.
In August 2019 a new ransomware was spotted in ID Ransomware that was named Mailto
based on the extension that was appended to encrypted files.
It was not known until today when the Australian Toll Group disclosed that their network was
attacked by the Mailto ransomware, that we discovered that this ransomware is targeting
the enterprise.
It should be noted that the ransomware has been commonly called the Mailto Ransomware
due to the appended extension, but analysis of one of its decryptors indicates that it is
named Netwalker. We will discuss this later in the article.

The Mailto / Netwalker ransomware

1/11

In a recent sample of the Mailto ransomware shared with BleepingComputer by
MalwareHunterTeam, the executable attempts to impersonate the 'Sticky Password'
software.

Impersonating Sticky Password

When executed, the ransomware uses an embedded config that includes the ransom note
template, ransom note file names, length of id/extension, whitelisted files, folders, and
extensions, and various other configuration options.
According to Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez who also analyzed the ransomware, the
configuration is quite sophisticated and detailed compared to other ransomware infections.
"The ransomware and its group have one of the more granular and more sophisticated
configurations observed," Kremez told BleepingComputer.
The configuration that was embedded in the analyzed sample can be found here.

Ransomware config
While almost all current ransomware infections utilize a whitelist of folders, files, and
extensions that will be skipped, Mailto utilizes a much longer list of whitelisted folders and
files than we normally see.
For example, below is the list of folders that will be skipped from being encrypted.

*system volume information
*windows.old
*:\users\*\*temp
*msocache
*:\winnt
*$windows.~ws
*perflogs
*boot
*:\windows
*:\program file*
\vmware
\\*\users\*\*temp
\\*\winnt nt
\\*\windows
*\program file*\vmwaree
*appdata*microsoft
*appdata*packages
*microsoft\provisioning
*dvd maker
*Internet Explorer
*Mozilla
*Old Firefox data
*\program file*\windows media*
*\program file*\windows portable*
*windows defender
*\program file*\windows nt
*\program file*\windows photo*
*\program file*\windows side*
*\program file*\windowspowershell
*\program file*\cuas*
*\program file*\microsoft games
*\program file*\common files\system em
*\program file*\common files\*shared
*\program file*\common files\reference ass*
*\windows\cache*
*temporary internet*
*media player
*:\users\*\appdata\*\microsoft
\\*\users\*\appdata\*\microsoft

When encrypting files, the Mailto ransomware will append an extension using the
format .mailto[{mail1}].{id}. For example, a file named 1.doc will be encrypted and renamed
to 1.doc.mailto[sevenoneone@cock.li].77d8b as seen below.

4/11

Encrypted Files
The ransomware will also create ransom notes named using the file name format of {ID}Readme.txt. For example, in our test run the ransom note was named 77D8B-Readme.txt.
This ransom note will contain information on what happened to the computer and two email
addresses that can be used to get the payment amount and instructions.

Mailto / Netwalker Ransom Note
This ransomware is still being analyzed and it is not known if there are any weaknesses in
the encryption algorithm that can be used to decrypt files for free. If anything is discovered,
we will be sure to let everyone know.
For now, those who are infected can discuss this ransomware and receive support in our
dedicated Mailto / Netwalker Ransomware Support & Help Topic.

Is it named Mailto or Netwalker?
When new ransomware infections are found, the discoverer or researchers will typically
look for some indication as to the name given to it by the ransomware developer.
When a ransomware does not provide any clues as to its name, in many cases the
ransomware will be named after the extension appended to encrypted files.
As the Mailto ransomware did not have any underlying hints as to its real name, at the time
of discovery it was just called Mailto based on the extension.
Soon after, Coveware discovered a decryptor for the ransomware that indicated that the
developer's name for the infection is 'Netwalker'.

Decrypter
In situations like this, it is difficult to decide what name we should continue to call the
ransomware.
On one hand, we clearly know its name is Netwalker, but on the other hand, the victims
know it as Mailto and most of the helpful information out there utilizes that name.
To make it easier for victims, we decided to continue to refer to this ransomware as Mailto,
but the names can be used interchangeably

Ransom note text:
Hi!
Your files are encrypted.
All encrypted files for this computer has extension: .{id}
-If for some reason you read this text before the encryption ended,
this can be understood by the fact that the computer slows down,
and your heart rate has increased due to the ability to turn it off,
then we recommend that you move away from the computer and accept that you have been
compromised,
rebooting/shutdown will cause you to lose files without the possibility of recovery
and even god will not be able to help you,
it could be files on the network belonging to other users, sure you want to take
that responsibility?
-Our encryption algorithms are very strong and your files are very well protected,
you can't hope to recover them without our help.
The only way to get your files back is to cooperate with us and get the decrypter
program.
Do not try to recover your files without a decrypt program, you may damage them and
then they will be impossible to recover.
We advise you to contact us as soon as possible, otherwise there is a possibility
that your files will never be returned.
For us this is just business and to prove to you our seriousness, we will decrypt
you some files for free,
but we will not wait for your letter for a long time, mail can be abused, we are
moving on, hurry up with the decision.
Сontact us:
1.{mail1}
2.{mail2}
Don't forget to include your code in the email:

"""As the Mailto ransomware did not have any underlying hints as to its real name, at
the time of discovery it was just called Mailto based on the extension."""
It is not right info. A screenshot of the decrypter that “proves” today the name was
published 3 days after the first publication. That is September 9, 2019. Here are
tweets by date. Look.

Thanks. Wasn't aware of the previous discovery. Fixed attribution.

what other companies have been affected by Mailto other than Toll Australia?

Mine :\ For us it was through a "200.exe" that they pushed with psexec from a server
that had an RDP vulnerability. 200.exe had "Glary Utilities" as it's name under its
properties.
Our .mailto email addresses were also different.
1.johprohnpo@cock.li
2.cancandecan@tutanota.com
We are still very much in the middle of recovering. If anyone learns anything new
about decrypting these, hit me up and lets talk.

Virus ran on Saturday and the mailto email addresses are:
