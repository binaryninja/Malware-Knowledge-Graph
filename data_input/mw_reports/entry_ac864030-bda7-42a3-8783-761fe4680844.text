The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center (SOC) Team issues Cybereason Threat
Alerts to inform customers of emerging impacting threats. The Alerts summarize these
threats and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them. In this article, the
Cybereason Research team exposes Redeemer 2.0, an updated version of the original
ransomware.

What's Happening?
The malware dubbed Redeemer 2.0 is an updated variant of the Redeemer ransomware.
This version differs from its older variants as it:
Infects machines running the Windows 11 Operating Systems (OS).
Keeps the OS safe from unintended damage (outside of the file encryption).
Changes the icons of encrypted files
In this article, Cybereason Security Research Team analyzed the new release of this
ransomware and how to defend against it through the Cybereason Defense Platform.

detected but not prevented on purpose), it is possible to analyze the Redeemer actions on
the victim machine:

Cybereason Recommendations
4/6

The Cybereason Defense Platform detects and prevents Redeemer 2.0 infections through
the Anti-ransomware feature. Cybereason recommends the following:
Enable Anti-Malware and set the Anti-Malware > Signatures mode to Prevent,
Quarantine, or Disinfect
Enable Anti-Ransomware, set Anti-Ransomware to Prevent mode and enable canary
files (with default settings)
Enable Application Control
Keep systems fully patched: Make sure your systems are patched in order to mitigate
vulnerabilities
Regularly backup files and create a backup process and policy : Restoring your files
from a backup is the fastest way to regain access to your data
