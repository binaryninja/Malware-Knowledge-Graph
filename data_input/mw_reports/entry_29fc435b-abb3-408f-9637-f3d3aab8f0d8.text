The Prelude to Ransomware: A Look
into Current QAKBOT Capabilities
and Global Activities
Technical Brief

Introduction
QAKBOT (detected by Trend Micro as TrojanSpy.Win32.QAKBOT) is a modular and highly
evasive information-stealing malware that was first discovered in 2007. This threat is also
known as QBOT and PinkSlipbot. Initial versions of QAKBOT targeted financial data and was
classified as a banking trojan, but more recent versions have acted as a delivery mechanism for
“second stage” malware. Specifically, QAKBOT seems to lead to targeted attacks involving data
theft (exfiltration) and ransomware.

QAKBOT Capabilities
The core QAKBOT loader functionality is extended using a variety of plug-ins. In earlier
QAKBOT versions, components were embedded as resources in the main executable. In more
recent versions, the injection DLL, update script, and plug-ins are downloaded by the QAKBOT
core after communicating with the command-and-control (C&C) server. The plug-ins listed here
provide QAKBOT operators with the functionality needed to achieve their objectives.

Atera Remote Monitoring Management (RMM) software

QAKBOT Links to Targeted Ransomware Attacks
QAKBOT operators are key enablers for ransomware attacks. These operators achieve access
to infected environments through the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons, which function as
standalone backdoors, or via a Cobalt Strike or Atera RMM plug-in. Since 2019, QAKBOT
infections have led to the eventual deployment of the following human-operated ransomware
families:


MegaCortex (2019)



Egregor (2020)



PwndLocker (2019)



Sodinokibi/REvil (2021)



ProLock (2020)

Malware Analysis
The QAKBOT infection chain usually starts with malicious spam emails and the infection
spreads from there. The stages shown here are typical of QAKBOT but might vary slightly over
time.

Stage

Arrival

# Description


Malicious spam emails with malicious attachment



The document uses Excel 4.0 macros and themed social engineering to trick
users into opening the email.



The excel document contains Excel 4.0 macrso with a malicious dropper
routine that will download the QAKBOT DLL from a remote server.



Social engineering is used to trick the user into “Enabling Content” (macros).



Once macros are enabled, the QAKBOT loader DLL is downloaded and
executed.



Persistence is achieved through the installation of registry keys and a
scheduled task.



The malicious QAKBOT process phones home to the C&C server.

4



The C&C server sends additional modules to the infected host .



Attackers might obtain “hands on keyboard” access to the infected
environment following the deployment of a backdoor (such as Cobalt Strike)
as a plug-in or as a separate dropped file.



Attackers might execute discovery commands to further evaluate the
environment.



Attackers might move laterally from the infected host.



In some cases, attackers will deploy ransomware in the environment.

QAKBOT Arrival Variations
QAKBOT uses a variety of delivery mechanisms, including different scripting languages and
malicious documents. In the past, QAKBOT has also collaborated with other botnet operators,
namely the now defunct Emotet.

*Emotet is an example of malware installation as a service, wherein operators install other
malware on their bots for a fee.
Figure 3. QAKBOT delivery mechanisms

QAKBOT Malicious Documents and Excel 4.0 Macros
Since late 2020, QAKBOT operators have leveraged malicious Microsoft Excel documents with
heavily obfuscated Excel 4.0 macros to evade detection in the initial access phase of the attack.

Figure 4. Malicious document delivering QAKBOT (from June 2021 MalSpam Campaign)

The primary motivation behind QAKBOT’s (and other malware distributors’) shift toward this
delivery mechanism can likely be attributed to the lack of support for Excel 4.0 macros in the
Windows AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI) at that time. Excel 4.0 macro support was only
added to AMSI in March 2021, while VBA macro parsing has been supported by AMSI since
2018.

QAKBOT Operators’ Use of Hijacked Email
Conversations
The use of hijacked email conversations is a noteworthy technique used by QAKBOT
distributors as a social engineering tactic. In the example shown in Figure 5, an email thread
between Kelly and Sandy (number 1 in the figure) was stolen during a previous infection by the
QAKBOT email collection module. The thread is then reused or hijacked by QAKBOT operators
(number 2 in the figure) in a malicious spam campaign. The malicious email appears to come
from Sandy in reply — but it actually contains the malicious document that drops QAKBOT
(number 3 in the figure).
The use of hijacked email threads in malicious spam emails is a tactic that was first used by the
cybercriminals who operated the now defunct Emotet malware.

Figure 5. The hijacked email thread delivering QAKBOT

QAKBOT Infection Routine
Figure 6 shows that the XLSM files contain hidden sheets and an auto_open macro (step 1 in
this figure) that executes as soon as the victim opens the document and selects the “Enable
Content” button. The macro code evaluates a sequence of formulas that are distributed at
various indexes (step 2 in this figure) in the document. This is an obfuscation technique that is
designed to thwart detection using simple strings.

Figure 6. The Excel formulas containing malicious code fragments

Figure 7. Hidden sheets in a QAKBOT XLSM dropper
In the sample in Figure 8, the code generates a unique file name using NOW() (step 1 in this
figure) to output a timestamp to be used as part of the file name. The dynamic URL formation
makes it harder to block exact URLs. Next, the functions (step 2 in this figure) to be called are
resolved and the first of three download attempts from hard-coded hosts begins (step 3 in this
figure). The downloaded file is stored in the disk as “Post.storg*”. This is the main QAKBOT
DLL, which is loaded by “regsvr32 -s” (step 4 in this figure). The QAKBOT main loader DLL is
loaded by regsvr32.exe with the -s command.

Figure 8. Analysis of QAKBOT sample

QAKBOT Installation
Packed QAKBOT loader  Process hollowing
The main program is unpacked in memory and injected into a new process that started in a
suspended state. The injection routine targets the process memory of one of three targets
(iexplore.exe, mobsync.exe, or explorer.exe) where the target is unmapped and replaced with
the unpacked QAKBOT loader program. Once the code is injected, QAKBOT calls
ResumeThread().

Figure 9. Process hollowing (UnmapViewOfFile -> VirtualAlloc)

Persistence mechanisms and anti-analysis/anti-sandbox
routines
The loader creates a persistence via a scheduled task using the now deprecated at.exe. A
dropped Javascript file creates a scheduled task for persistence for the QAKBOT core. The
same mechanism is executed when an update is received from the C&C server.

Figure 10. Persistence mechanisms through scheduled tasks
QAKBOT also includes several routines to detect the presence of security software, and to
detect if it is being executed on a virtual machine (VM).

Figure 11. Routines to detect if there are security solutions on the device

QAKBOT UPnP: Recruiting new proxies for QAKBOT’s
botnet
QAKBOT leverages Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) to identify other devices on the
local network. It then parses network device information collected with SSDP to identify internet
gateways.

Figure 12. QAKBOT leveraging SSDP and parsing information collected with SSDP
With gateways identified, it uses UPnP to create port-forwarding rules on gateway devices to
route traffic from the internet to the infected endpoint. The infected device is then capable of
acting as a Tier 3 proxy in the QAKBOT botnet.

Figure 13. UpnP used to create port-forwarding rules

QAKBOT Information Stealing Plug-ins
Outlook email collector
QAKBOT has been exfiltrating emails from Microsoft Outlook since 2019. The stolen information
is used to enhance the social engineering capabilities of future attacks by spamming email
thread members. QAKBOT extracts emails, parses email headers, and extracts thread
recipients from the address book.

Figure 14. The emailcollector_dll

Figure 15. Invoking the “GetEmailMsgRecipients()” function

Figure 16. Extraction of email address using email regex and CollectOutlookData() function call
The QAKBOT email collector plug-in performs email header parsing to identify interesting
header items. This process includes parsing email authentication results from DomainKeys
Identified Mail (DKIM) signatures and antispam detection results. The email collector module
also collects data from the Microsoft Outlook address book. After the collection, stolen data is
uploaded with HTTPS POST (not FTP as used by QAKBOT for other data exfiltration).

Figure 18. The function call to collect address book information
CollectOutlookAddressBookThread()

Figure 19. Function showing the email data exfiltration method

Password grabber plug-in
The QAKBOT password grabber module can extract credentials (username, password, and
host) from the following applications:


Outlook



Internet Explorer



CuteFTP



Firefox



Chrome

Popular browser and email clients are potential targets, and CuteFTP, a rarely used FTP client,
is also on the list. There are a few interesting points to note when looking over the list of
targeted applications. For example, we know that QAKBOT uses stolen FTP details for the
purpose of data exfiltration channels. Chrome no longer supports FTP, so malicious actors
would need to grab credentials out of a separate application to steal FTP credentials. Also,
QAKBOT uses Network Security Service (NSS) libraries (nss.dll) to interact with Firefox
password storage and pilfer credentials from the Firefox SQLite database

Figure 25. QAKBOT using NSS libraries to interact with Firefox

Digital certificate theft
QAKBOT is also able to steal digital certificates. It enumerates the installed digital certificates
with CertEnumSystemStore() and extracts both the certificate names and the data.
QAKBOT leverages FTP account information stored in the configuration to exfiltrate the stolen
data. The FTP accounts are legitimate user accounts that were likely compromised in previous
QAKBOT infections. In other words, the domains are not simply malicious domains created for
the sole purpose of harvesting data stolen by QAKBOT.

QAKBOT Campaigns
1H 2021 campaign details
In the observed campaigns, the threat actors use both “financial” (compensation, overdue debt,
rebate) and “business process” (claim, complaint, document) email header lures to entrap
victims.

QAKBOT Infrastructure
QAKBOT tiered C&C infrastructure
QAKBOT uses a tiered (layered) network of C&C servers, which
means that intermediary layers of servers facilitate
communication with the C&C back end.
Tier 1 is the core infrastructure, and is also the botnet back
end. Tier 3 proxies relay C&C server communication to
the real C&C servers represented in the diagram as Tier
2. Tier 3 proxies get blocked quickly, so they are rotated
in the malware configuration and change frequently.
This architecture shields the true location of back-end
proxies from security researchers and law enforcement.
Here is a list of TCP ports used in C&C communication by the
QAKBOT core and plug-ins 22, 80, 443, 995, 1194, 2078, 2087,
2222, 3389, 8443, 32100.

QAKBOT C&C infrastructure by autonomous system
We found that almost 25% of QAKBOT Tier 3 C&C server infrastructure can be associated with
a single Autonomous System Number (ASN). ASNs are used by network operators to control
routing and exchange routing information with other internet service providers (ISPs).
