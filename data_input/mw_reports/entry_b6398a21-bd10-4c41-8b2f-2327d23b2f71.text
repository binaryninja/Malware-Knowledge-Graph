A review of the latest Charming Kitten phishing campaign

A review of the latest Charming Kitten phishing campaign
During the Christmas holidays and the beginning of the new year, the Charming Kitten group,
the Iranian state-backed hackers, have begun a targeted phishing campaign of espionage
against different individuals to collect information.
Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Phosphorus, is one of the hacker groups backed
by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The group started the new round of attacks at a time when
most companies, offices, organizations, etc. were either closed or half-closed during
Christmas holidays and, as a result, their technical support and IT departments were not able
to immediately review, identify, and neutralize these cyber incidents. Charming Kitten has
taken full advantage of this timing to execute its new campaign to maximum effect.
A review of samples of this phishing campaign shows that the attackers concentrated their
attacks on individuals’ online accounts, especially personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo! and
Outlook) and business emails (organization and university emails). After accessing the
credential details of the accounts, they steal sensitive data from their victims.
Additionally, based on the collected evidence, it is clear that Charming Kitten specifically
chose their targets from members of think tanks, political research centers, university
professors, journalists, and environmental activists in the countries around the Persian Gulf,
Europe, and the US. Our observations show this phishing campaign is a continuation of
other Charming Kitten campaigns that were started in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.

Details Of The Attacks
Our examination of the acquired samples shows hackers generally use two main methods of
“Sending Fake SMS” and “Sending Fake Emails” to execute their attacks. It is also important
to note that whilst using these two methods, the attackers try not to leave any trace of
themselves and, even after gaining access to their victims’ accounts, they do not block the
victims’ access to their own accounts.

Method #1: Fake SMS

1/9

Like many other phishing attacks, in this phishing campaign, Charming Kitten uses a fake
SMS (Figure 1) to trick their victims. They send confirmation messages stating ‘Google
Account Recovery’ to their targets; they claim these messages are sent by Google and the
user must follow the link in the SMS to confirm the identity.

Figure 1. A sample of the fake SMS

The most important point in this method is the structure of the link in the SMS that seems
legitimate: hxxps://www.google[.]com/url?q=https://script.google.com/xxxx.
At first glance, these links generally cause less suspicion for the targets. After opening the
links and several redirections, the victims are led to final phishing domains such as
“mobile[.]recover-session-service[.]site” etc. More detail about this technique is available in
the Redirect Chain section.

Method #2: Fake Email
Another method used in this phishing campaign is sending fake emails with deceptive titles
like “Merry Christmas, and sending note/book/photo and others”, which are usually sent by
previously hacked emails.
Figure 2 shows one of these phishing emails where the attackers cordially invite the target to
open the link in the email’s body. In order to achieve this, Charming Kitten used the subject
“New Years Greetings” with convincing sentences such as “This year I decided to make my
friends happy with my last book. Here’s my special Xmas gift for you.” in the body of email.
By comparing Figure 2 to Figure 1, it is clear that the structure of the link is similar to the
links used in the fake SMS.

We believe that Charming Kitten continuously try different styles of email to trap their victims
as quickly as possible. For example, Figure 3 shows another fake email that was sent to the
same victim a day after the initial email (Figure 2).

Redirect Chain
Utilizing and weaponizing legal and credible services to hide destructive intent is one of the
techniques used by hackers in some phishing campaigns.
This technique has become significant in the recent campaign by Charming Kitten. Our latest
investigations show that this Iranian hacking group has focused on this method over the past
two years. For example, Charming Kitten weaponized “site.google.com”1 in 2019 and
2/9

“script.google.com” in this campaign.
Our examination shows the hackers have used a mix of services such as ‘script.google.com’
and ‘iplogger.org’ in this campaign in order to create a chain of redirection to obfusticate their
hacking operations. Redirection links initially help bypass the security layers in email
services, and then provide the attackers more control to redirect the target to the final URL.
Figure 4 shows an experimental example of the function of each link in the redirect chain
technique.

Infinite different types of phishing attacks
Our investigation shows Charming Kitten has targeted different people and organisations in
relatively different fields. For example, based on our initial findings, the hackers use domain
names such as mail-newyorker[.]com, news12[.]com[.]recover-session-service[.]site with the
intention of targeting “The New Yorker” online magazine readers and “News 12 Networks” TV
channel staff and their audience.
Charming Kitten had previously used the same method using names such as Wall Street
Journal1, CNN2, Deutsche Welle3, etc.

Thanks for your article. It was fantastic and I enjoyed it. Photos and contents were very
interesting. Congratulations! We actually traveled to this area with my friends a couple
of years ago and took some good pictures at this location and found some interesting
things that I didn’t see in your article. I think you’ll understand if you see my pictures
and contents. I’ll share it for you here.

In reviewing other samples, we have found that Charming Kitten has used many fake
domains to target different online accounts in different services. Although accounts such as
Gmail, Yahoo! and Outlook are the main targets of this campaign, there are more samples
that show this Iranian hacking group targets other services such as Planet.com and
PlanetObserver.com - both are online satellite imagery services for special sectors such as
governments, industries, and military defenses - which shows the breadth of their campaign.

Infrastructure and History
We have reviewed and matched five common indicators to assess and analyze the
infrastructure that has been used by Charming Kitten (Figure 9). This infrastructure has been
used mostly in the third and fourth quarters of 2020:
Reverse IP/DNS lookup and matching the history with other common indicators
Common IP or IP CIDR range match
Use of unconventional TLD (i.e. .site) and using WHOIS protection
Use of deceptive words such as session, confirm, recovery, verification, service, etc., in
the name of the URLs as well as subdomains
Parallel use of Dynamic DNS, such as ddns.net, in a short period of time, which has a
temporal matching with other indicators
Reviewing these indicators side by side show that Charming Kitten has been constantly
active in recent months and has executed other attacks at the time of writing this report.
In reviewing related activity patterns of Charming Kitten and information about the
infrastructure used by this hacking group, we believe the extent and scale of this campaign is
significant in comparison with previous activity of Charming Kitten.

Conclusion And Recommendations
This investigation only relates to one aspect of the Iran-backed hacker group’s activities in
recent months; the extent and magnitude of this campaign was unforeseeable. We can
conclude that Charming Kitten has used complex techniques to gain access to individuals
and organizations that Iranian intelligence services are interested in targeting.

4/9

In order to protect yourself against these attacks, we strongly recommend using secure and
safe authentication methods such as two factor authentication with security keys, such
YubiKey8, for your online accounts.
As usual, we firmly suggest not to click on unknown links, to carefully review any URLs
before entering credential information, and not to download and run unknown files on mobile,
personal or work computers. These measures can significantly protect people who are the
targets of these types of campaigns.
It is important to note that the main cases mentioned in this report relate to the latest
Charming Kitten’s phishing campaign and that this campaign has significantly intensified in
recent days.
