Classified documents, allegedly from Iran, reveal secret research into how a cyber attack
could be used to sink a cargo ship or blow up a fuel pump at a petrol station.
The internal files, obtained by Sky News, also include information on satellite communication
devices used by the global shipping industry as well as a computer-based system that
controls things like lights, heating and ventilation in smart buildings across the world.
The papers appear to reveal a particular interest in researching companies and activities in
western countries, including the UK, France and the United States.
A security source with knowledge of the 57-page bundle of five research reports said it was
compiled by a secret, offensive cyber unit called Shahid Kaveh, which is part of Iran's elite
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) cyber command.
The source said he believed the work is evidence of efforts by Iran to collect intelligence on
civilian infrastructure that could be used to identify targets for future cyber attacks.
"They are creating a target bank to be used whenever they see fit," said the source, who
requested anonymity to be able to talk about the documents.
The Iranian embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations.
A growing number of countries, including the UK, possess cyber weapons and are working to
develop new offensive capabilities.
The work is typically top secret.
So it is highly unusual to see documented evidence allegedly of cyber research by a state.

INSIDE THE DOCUMENTS
Each of the five reports are marked 'very confidential'.
Towards the top of most of the files is a quote, which appears to be from Iran's Supreme
Leader, Ali Khamenei. It reads: "The Islamic Republic of Iran must become among the
world's most powerful in the area of cyber." The security source describes the quote as like a
"commander's statement of intent".
The reports are compiled by a cell called Intelligence Team 13. The source with knowledge
of the files refers to them as Intelligence Group 13 and said it is a sub-group within the IRGC
Shahid Kaveh unit, under an individual he named as Hamid Reza Lashgarian.
"They are supposed to be rather clandestine. They work on offensive cyber operations
globally," the source said.
Only two of the reports have a completion date on their front page.
One, which looks at what is known as a building management system – the computer
technology that controls things like lights, heating and ventilation in smart buildings – is from
19 November 2020.
Another, which looks at a German company called WAGO that manufactures electrical
components, is dated 19 April 2020.
Two of the other reports, one into fuel pumps at petrol stations and another into maritime
communications, include screen shots of internet searches dated to last year.

BALLAST WATER
One of the reports was entitled "Ballast Water". Across six pages, it looked at the complex
systems on large cargo ships that control things remotely like filtration and ballast water. The
authors appeared to rely on open source research rather than any privileged information.
A diagram illustrated a ship steady in the water, while another one showed a ship tilted to
one side. A caption underneath it said: "Picture three off balance".
Another diagram showed how commands could be sent remotely to a ship from a control
centre on land via a satellite link.
The report said: "These pumps are used to bring water into the tanks through centrifuges
and in order to operate correctly, the task must be completed with precision. Any problems
could result in the sinking of the ship."
In a concluding note, it observed: "Any kind of disruptive influence can cause disorder within
these systems and can cause significant and irreparable damage to the vessel."

FUEL PUMPS
Another piece of research was into a system called an automatic tank gauge that tracked the
flow of fuel at a petrol station. The report, which was also six pages long, name-checked
fuelling equipment produced by Franklin Fueling Systems, a US company.
"They support many customers in Europe, Africa, America and the Middle East and they can
control and manage these systems," it said.
Illustrated with a photograph of a petrol station and an image lifted from the website of
Franklin Fueling Systems, the file spelt out what it believed would be the impact of a
"problem" with the systems.
This includes the ability to cut off the fuel supply or change its temperature.
The report added: "[An] explosion of these fueling pumps is possible if these systems are
hacked and controlled remotely."

A spokesman for Franklin Fueling Systems said the company takes "seriously the need to
provide highly reliable and secure equipment to our customers".
He said it could be possible for a third party to cause issues with one or more petrol stations.
But he said he did not think it would be possible to trigger an explosion.
"There are a number of redundant safety systems involved in a typical fueling station, and we
do not believe that an explosion could be caused through control of the automatic tank
gauge or fuel management system, even if that were the user's intent," the spokesman said.

MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS
This report, 14 pages long, looked at two types of satellite communication used at sea.
One, called Seagull 5000i, provides phone, fax and other data services via a satellite link.
The report noted that it is a service offered via companies such as Wideye in Singapore and
Thuraya in the United Arab Emirates.
The other system of interest is called Sealink CIR.
Most of this file was simply open source research repeating facts about two systems.
But there was also a chart towards the end of the file that showed the results of what is
known as a "Google dork" – conducting internet searches with certain key phrases enclosed
in quotation marks to improve the accuracy of the search.
The authors of the report used the Chinese search engine Fofa.so as well as Binaryedge, a
search engine for internet-exposed devices, which is owned by a US company to search for
Seagull 5000i and Thuraya in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel and a
number of other countries.
One column listed a percentage figure, another listed the number of devices.
Sarah Jones from cyber security firm FireEye's Mandiant Threat Intelligence unit, who has
analysed the files, said it could refer to the percentage of devices whose log-in screens can
be seen from the internet search.

The document included a screen shot of a log-in screen. But there was no evidence that the
researchers went beyond conducting the search, such as attempting to access accounts.

SMART BUILDINGS
The other two reports were the only two that include a formal date on the front for when they
were compiled.
The most recent was one into building management systems – the computer-based systems
that control lighting, ventilation, heating, security alarms and other functions in a smart
building. Nine pages long, it was dated the Iranian calendar's equivalent of 19 November
2020.
The documents listed companies that provide these services. They included Honeywell in
the United States; the French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric; the German
giant Siemens; and KMC Controls, another US manufacturer.
The longest report – 22 pages – was into electrical equipment made by the German
company WAGO. It was dated the Iranian calendar’s equivalent of 19 April 2020.
The file examined vulnerabilities in what is called a programmable logic controller or PLC – a
computer control system.
But the authors appeared to conclude that it would not be possible to exploit them.
"Continuing the investigation, in order to use these processes, we noticed the vulnerabilities
within these systems are irreparable, if there is an attack, damage will not easy to fix," the
report said.

"Therefore, compared to other PLC brands, this brand is impenetrable once connected
online. When online, the infrastructure and intelligence on engineering cannot be reached
and cannot be lost.
"For our benefit, the best situation is for the PLC not to work as intended, and for that to
happen, a project must be written in the language of ladder to have multiple exits, as many
as possible. But the problem for this project is that we wouldn’t be able to assess the
damage caused. The other option is to assess the weak points and dangerous points of the
PLCs and software in order to attack our target. This option needs separate investigation and
research before we can find the weak points."

A THREAT TO 'OUR WAY OF LIFE'
Ben Wallace, Britain's defence secretary, said the Iranian documents – if authentic –
demonstrate how vulnerable the UK and its allies are to cyber attacks.
"Unless we do something about it, our critical national infrastructure, our way of life could be
threatened quite easily," he told Sky News.

17/27

Asked how much of a threat Iran poses in cyber space, General Sir Patrick Sanders, the top
military officer overseeing UK cyber operations, said: "They are among the most advanced
cyber actors. We take their capabilities seriously. We don’t overstate it. They are a serious
actor and they have behaved really irresponsibly in the past."
The source who shared the Iranian documents with Sky News said he was "very confident"
they were authentic.
Sky News shared the files with additional sources that would have the ability to tell if they
seemed authentic.
These sources indicated that they thought the files looked credible and interesting.
Sky News also shared the cache with the US cyber security company FireEye, which
investigates the Iranian cyber threat as well as those from other hostile states.
Mandiant Threat Intelligence, a part of FireEye, said: "The documents seem to emphasise
simple, opportunistic attacks.
"They discuss the possible physical impacts of cyber operations targeting civilian critical
infrastructure and the feasibility of conducting such attacks, while examining the percentage
of internet-accessible devices that could be potential targets."
It said that the five reports, which comprise the bundle, appear to be a response to a request
for information or research.

"Everything that was outlined in the documents really fits in with what we have seen from
Iranian capabilities and the way they plan their attacks, the way they structure and divide up
the work and go out and actually start the process of forming an operation," said Sarah
Jones, senior principle analyst at Mandiant.
She said these are the initial steps a state would take if they wanted to develop a specific
cyber attack capability.
"You are seeing all of that set up but you are not seeing any of the other phases of that. You
are seeing them saying – what would happen if we were to do this and how could someone
go about causing some sort of damage or destructive capabilities to really a lot of different
technologies?" she added.

WHY IT MATTERS

20/27

Iran is not the only country seeking to develop new methods of attack in cyber space.
The UK and its allies, as well as adversaries such as Russia, China and North Korea, are all
investing heavily in building new offensive capabilities.
The difference, according to British officials, is the targets that hostile states are willing to go
after in peacetime - from attempting to manipulate elections to causing physical damage to
civilian infrastructure like water supplies and petrol pumps.
"I think it is perfectly legitimate for states to seek to enhance their capabilities to defend and
protect themselves in cyber space," General Sir Patrick Sanders, commander of the UK
military's Strategic Command, which overseas British cyber operations, told Sky News.

21/27

"There is nothing wrong with that. But if you are using them in ways that are malign and
irresponsible you can cause harm or economic damage then that's not acceptable."
Cyber is an area where countries can covertly harm each other, steal secrets or manipulate
minds without fear of triggering a more conventional war – though a sufficiently devastating
attack from cyberspace could have that effect.
The UK does have the ability to cause harm in the same way as its opponents – but says it is
a power only used to counter a threat or respond to an attack.

22/27

Any cyber operation must be "responsible, targeted and proportionate", according to rules
governing the UK's National Cyber Force, which is a partnership between the military and the
spy agency GCHQ.
By contrast, Iranian-linked hackers are suspected of targeting the UK parliament in 2017,
with thousands of email accounts, including those of MPs, affected.
While Iran is viewed as a cyber threat, the country has also been the victim of multiple cyber
attacks – many of them targeted against its nuclear programme.
One of the first-known offensive cyber attacks was the Stuxnet virus, allegedly developed by
Israeli and US cyber spies, that was discovered at a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz in
2010.
More recently, in May last year computers at Iran's Shahid Rajee port terminal crashed,
bringing traffic to a halt, following a cyber attack that reportedly originated from Israel.
It was allegedly in retaliation to an Iranian attempt to hack Israel's water systems – an act
that prompted Yigal Unna, Israel's national cyber chief to warn that "cyber winter is coming".

23/27

It should come as little surprise that Iran appears to be gathering information to hone its
offensive cyber capabilities.

24/27

China and Russia are viewed by the UK as the most potent, hostile cyber threats, followed
by Iran and North Korea.
But Britain and some of its allies, in particular the United States and Israel, also have the
ability to launch attacks in cyberspace.
They just operate under different rules of engagement.
With so much of the world reliant on the internet, computers and access to information, cyber
is a growing domain of conflict, where nations, criminals and lone hackers are able to inflict
damage or help in their side's defence.
Cyber attacks typically happen in a grey zone of harm that lies between war and peace.
Sky News produced a podcast series on this evolution in the nature of warfare.
In the grey zone, anything can and is being weaponised, from spreading malware on a
computer or publishing fake news to poisoning an opponent or bribing a politician.
It means the act of leaking information also plays a part in this contest.
And no one is too unimportant to be a target.
