Ransomware Group Turns to Facebook Ads

It’s bad enough that many ransomware gangs now have blogs where they publish data
stolen from companies that refuse to make an extortion payment. Now, one crime group has
started using hacked Facebook accounts to run ads publicly pressuring their ransomware
victims into paying up.

On the evening of Monday, Nov. 9, an ad campaign apparently taken out by the Ragnar
Locker Team began appearing on Facebook. The ad was designed to turn the screws to the
Italian beverage vendor Campari Group, which acknowledged on Nov. 3 that its computer
systems had been sidelined by a malware attack.
On Nov. 6, Campari issued a follow-up statement saying “at this stage, we cannot completely
exclude that some personal and business data has been taken.”
“This is ridiculous and looks like a big fat lie,” reads the Facebook ad campaign from the
Ragnar crime group. “We can confirm that confidential data was stolen and we talking about
huge volume of data.”

The ad went on to say Ragnar Locker Team had offloaded two terabytes of information and
would give the Italian firm until 6 p.m. EST today (Nov. 10) to negotiate an extortion payment
in exchange for a promise not to publish the stolen files.
The Facebook ad blitz was paid for by Hodson Event Entertainment, an account tied to
Chris Hodson, a deejay based in Chicago. Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, Hodson said his
Facebook account indeed was hacked, and that the attackers had budgeted $500 for the
entire campaign.
“I thought I had two-step verification turned on for all my accounts, but now it looks like the
only one I didn’t have it set for was Facebook,” Hodson said.
Hodson said a review of his account shows the unauthorized campaign reached
approximately 7,150 Facebook users, and generated 770 clicks, with a cost-per-result of 21
cents. Of course, it didn’t cost the ransomware group anything. Hodson said Facebook billed
him $35 for the first part of the campaign, but apparently detected the ads as fraudulent
sometime this morning before his account could be billed another $159 for the campaign.

It’s not clear whether this was an isolated incident, or whether the fraudsters also ran ads
using other hacked Facebook accounts. A spokesperson for Facebook said the company is
still investigating the incident. A request for comment sent via email to Campari’s media
relations team was returned as undeliverable.
But it seems likely we will continue to see more of this and other mainstream advertising
efforts by ransomware groups going forward, even if victims really have no expectation that
paying an extortion demand will result in criminals actually deleting or not otherwise using
stolen data.
Fabian Wosar, chief technology officer at computer security firm Emsisoft, said some
ransomware groups have become especially aggressive of late in pressuring their victims to
pay up.
“They have also started to call victims,” Wosar said. “They’re outsourcing to Indian call
centers, who call victims asking when they are going to pay or have their data leaked.”
