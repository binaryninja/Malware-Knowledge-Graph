As one of the key members of Google’s App Defense Alliance, Zimperium helps ensure the
Android ecosystem is safer by processing all apps before they reach Google Play. Despite
this direct involvement, malicious applications can find their way to Android devices through
various app stores, sideloaded applications, and compromises malicious websites that trick
users into downloading and installing apps.
Since 2017, over 1,800 Android applications infected with Joker have been removed from
the Google Play store, highlighting a long history of this malware and its evolution throughout
the years. Despite Google’s advanced technologies and its partnerships with malware
security companies like Zimperium, the malicious actors have routinely found new and
unique ways to get this malware into both official and unofficial app stores. While they are
never long for life in these repositories, the persistence highlights how mobile malware, just
like traditional endpoint malware, does not disappear but continues to be modified and
advanced in a constant cat and mouse game.

Recently, the Zimperium zLabs mobile threat research team has noticed a large uptick in
Joker variants on Android marketplaces, with over 1000 new samples since our last
coverage in September of 2020. These variants were found using the same malware
machine learning engine powering zIPS on-device detection and Google’s App Alliance,
proving that on-device detection capabilities are a must to ensure full protection of an
enterprises’ mobile endpoints.
Let’s first recap why Joker is so effective and popular for Android malware.
What Is Joker?
Joker trojans are malicious Android applications that have been known since 2017 for
notoriously performing bill fraud and subscribing users to premium services. The outcome of
a successful mobile infection is financial gain for the cybercriminal, oftentimes under the
nose of the victim until long after the money is gone, with little to no recourse for recovery.
The trojan’s main functionality is to load a dex file and perform malicious activities like
inspecting the notifications or sending SMS messages to premium subscriptions. While
Google Play have worked hard to bring alerts to the mobile user, Joker counts on the
distracted nature of mobile alerts and social engineering for them to be accepted or even
ignored.
The malicious activities can be divided into the following categories:
1. Decode or decrypt the strings to get the first stage URL.
2. Download the payload dex file from the above URL.
3. Load the payload dex file using reflection techniques to invoke the DexClassLoader
constructor.
4. The dex file performs malicious activities and communicates with the C&C server.
In the following flowchart, the full attack chain is shown.

These are the four pivot points each Joker sample uses, and it employs several evasion
techniques to remain undetected. Most often, Joker is disguised as commonly downloaded
applications like games, wallpapers, messengers, translators, and photo editors.
What Has Changed Since September 2020
The malicious developers behind the current, most advanced forms of Joker are taking
advantage of legitimate developer techniques to try and hide the actual intent of the payload
from traditional, legacy-based mobile security toolsets. They are starting by using the
common framework Flutter to code the application in a way that is commonly seen by
traditional scanners. Due to the commonality of Flutter, even malicious application code will
look legitimate and clean, whereas many scanners are looking for disjointed code with errors
or improper assemblies.

The malicious developers are embedding Joker as a payload that can be encrypted in
different ways, either a .dex file xored or encrypted with a number, or through the same .dex
file as before, but hidden inside an image using steganography. Both manners are
obfuscating the intent of the payload from the legacy scan and mobile security tools.
After successful installation, the application infected with Joker will run a scan using Google
Play APIs to check the latest version of the app in Google Play Store. If there is no answer,
the malware remains silent since it can be running on a dynamic analysis emulator. But if the
version found in the store is older than the current version, the local malware payload is
executed, infecting the mobile device. If the version in the store is newer than the current
one, then the command and control servers are contacted to download an updated version
of the payload.
Joker Trojan’s never seen before behavior includes URL shorteners, checking the current
time against a hardcoded launch-time, image infected using steganography on legit cloud file
hosting services, and a combination of native libraries to decrypt the offline payload from the
APK’s assets or connect to C&C for the payload.
Joker vs. Zimperium
Zimperium zIPS customers are protected against 100% of these Joker variants analyzed
with our zero-day, on-device z9 Mobile Threat Defense machine learning engine model and
static analysis.
As a standard protocol, the Zimperium zLabs team checks new malware samples against not
only the current machine learning model but past ones as well. In the case of Joker,
Zimperium zIPS customers have been constantly protected against these latest variants of
this aggressive Android trojan.
To ensure your Android users are protected from the Joker malware, we recommend a quick
risk assessment. Inside zConsole, admins can review which apps are side-loaded onto the
device that could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at risk.
