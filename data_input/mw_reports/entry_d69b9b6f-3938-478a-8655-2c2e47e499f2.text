Continued Targeting of
Indian Power Grid Assets by
Chinese State-Sponsored
Activity Group

April 6, 2022

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Despite a partial troop disengagement between India and
China from February 2021, the prolonged targeting of Indian
critical infrastructure continues to raise concerns over prepositioning activity being conducted by Chinese adversaries.
While this latest activity displays targeting and capability
consistencies with previously identified RedEcho activity,
there are also some notable distinctions. At this time, we have
not identified technical evidence allowing us to attribute it to
RedEcho, and we are currently clustering this latest activity
under the temporary group name Threat Activity Group 38 (TAGThis report details a campaign conducted by a likely Chinese state-sponsored 38) 1.

threat activity group targeting the Indian power sector. The activity was identified
through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and
expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform, SecurityTrails,
PolySwarm, Team Cymru’s Pure Signal™, and common open-source tools and
techniques. The report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic
and operational intelligence relating to Indian and Chinese cyber activity. Recorded
Future notified the appropriate Indian government departments prior to publication
of the suspected intrusions to support incident response and remediation
investigations within affected organizations. With thanks to our colleagues at
Dragos for early sharing and collaboration.

Executive Summary
In February 2021, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group reported
on intrusion activity targeting operational assets within India’s
power grid that we attributed to a likely Chinese state-sponsored
threat activity group we track as RedEcho. Following a short lull
after the publication of our RedEcho reporting, we have detected
ongoing targeting of Indian power grid organizations by Chinalinked adversaries, frequently using the privately shared modular
backdoor ShadowPad. ShadowPad continues to be employed by
an ever-increasing number of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and
Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups, with its origins
linked to known MSS contractors first using the tool in their own
operations and later likely acting as a digital quartermaster.

Key Judgments
• Given the continued targeting of State and Regional Load
Despatch Centres in India over the past 18 months, first
from RedEcho and now in this latest TAG-38 activity, this
targeting is likely a long-term strategic priority for select
Chinese state-sponsored threat actors active within
India.
• The prolonged targeting of Indian power grid assets by
Chinese state-linked groups offers limited economic
espionage or traditional intelligence-gathering
opportunities. We believe this targeting is instead likely
intended to enable information gathering surrounding
critical infrastructure systems or is pre-positioning for
future activity.
• The objective for intrusions may include gaining an
increased understanding into these complex systems
in order to facilitate capability development for future
use or gaining sufficient access across the system in
preparation for future contingency operations.

In recent months, we observed likely network intrusions
targeting at least 7 Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs)
responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control
and electricity dispatch within these respective states. Notably,
this targeting has been geographically concentrated, with the
identified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the
disputed India-China border in Ladakh. One of these SLDCs
was also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest
set of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely
different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting
of power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a
national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary
of a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity
group. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and co- 1 Typically, Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group or campaign,

groupings and hasn’t yet graduated or merged into an established activity group.

infrastructure highlighted and shift its infrastructure modus
operandi. Despite this, evidence of targeting of Indian power
assets and organizations with links to critical infrastructure
from Chinese state-sponsored actors continued. This included
the targeting of an Indian managed service provider (MSP) and
operational technology (OT) vendor using ShadowPad, which
aligns with activity described in recent Dragos reporting. We
attribute this particular activity to a separate activity group we
track as Threat Activity Group 26 (TAG-26). We have observed
TAG-26 targeting multiple high-value organizations in India using
ShadowPad, Poison Ivy, and the RoyalRoad RTF weaponizer.
The use of ShadowPad across Chinese activity groups
continues to grow over time, with new clusters of activity
regularly identified using the backdoor as well as continued
adoption by previously tracked clusters. At this time, we track
at least 10 distinct activity groups with access to ShadowPad,
which is assessed to have likely been originally developed and
used by MSS-linked contractors linked to the APT41 (BARIUM)
intrusion set.

Threat Analysis
Since at least September 2021, we have observed TAG38 intrusions targeting the identified victim organizations. The
group has employed probable compromised infrastructure for
command and control of ShadowPad implants used to target the
identified networks, as well as using the open source tool Fast
Reverse Proxy (FRP). Figure 3 highlights ongoing TAG-38 C2
detection and network traffic analysis exfiltration events from
victim networks within the Recorded Future platform between
September 2021 and March 2022.

Targeting of Indian Power Sector
The identified victimology within this latest campaign is
confined to Indian targets, specifically at least 7 SLDCs, the
Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company, and
a national emergency response system. As shown in Figure
4, the identified SLDCs were all located in Northern India, in
proximity to the disputed China-India border in Ladakh. SLDCs
are responsible for carrying out real-time operations for
grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective
states, similar to the Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs)
previously targeted in reported RedEcho activity. This makes
these organizations critical for maintaining grid frequency and
stability, with SLDCs maintaining access to supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) systems present across respective
states for the purpose of grid control and electricity dispatch. At
this time, we have not observed evidence of access to industrial
control system (ICS) environments in this activity.

TAG-38 Infrastructure Clustering
Using a combination of proactive infrastructure detection
techniques and network traffic analysis, we uncovered a cluster
of C2 infrastructure engaged in this prolonged targeting of
Indian critical infrastructure over several months. Based on our
analysis, the adversary infrastructure cluster identified consists
entirely of likely compromised internet-facing, third-party DVR/
IP camera devices. The compromise of often poorly secured
internet-of-things (IOT) devices such as IP cameras for use in
follow-on intrusion activity has previously been seen for threats
ranging from Mirai-based botnets (1,2) to the Chinese statesponsored threat activity group RedBravo (APT31/ZIRCONIUM).
At this time, we have not determined the means in which these
devices were originally compromised, which may include the use
of default credentials. Using a series of analytical techniques
and heuristics, we were able to cluster a network of these C2
IPs together, all of which matched all or most of the following
criteria:
• Victim infrastructure observed communicating to all of
the identified C2 servers consisted solely of the same
overlapping Indian power grid victims, logistics company,
and Indian emergency response system.
• All C2 servers were likely compromised DVR/IP camera
devices and were primarily geolocated in Taiwan or
South Korea.
5

• Likely compromised devices were observed with the
default open ports 80/554/9090 associated with
the compromised device, as well as an additional
actor-controlled port(s) opened for malware C2
communications.
• A large proportion were confirmed as ShadowPad
C2 servers using Recorded Future C2 detection
methodologies, a technique previously used in historical
Insikt Group reporting on RedEcho and other Chinese
state-sponsored activity groups (1,2,3).
• A large proportion of the identified C2s had the open
source tool Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) server component
configured on port 8443. FRP can read predefined
configurations and allows you to expose local services
that are hidden behind the NAT or a firewall to the
internet. This tool has been abused by numerous statesponsored groups, including the Iran-linked group
Phosphorus and several Chinese actors (1,2).
• A large proportion of the identified C2s
shared a unique SSL certificate spoofing
Microsoft on port 443 (SHA1 fingerprint:
0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf). This
certificate has multiple links to wider Chinese statesponsored cyber espionage activity and is discussed in
further detail below.

The use of a shared SSL certificate (SHA1 fingerprint
0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf) exhibited on
several TAG-38 servers was also notable. This SSL certificate
was also identified historically on a few dozen other servers
with links to Chinese cyber espionage activity. For example,
one of the IP addresses historically exhibiting this certificate,
185.243.41[.]240, concurrently hosted several domains attributed
to the group we track as TAG-26 referenced earlier in this report
(including supership.dynv6[.]net, supermarket.ownip[.]net, and
greatsong.soundcast[.]me). At this time, we believe it is unlikely
that the use of this certificate is exclusive to a single activity
group. This is based on wider context such as differing targeting
patterns, infrastructure TTPs, and capability use linked to the
infrastructure historically sighted exhibiting this certificate,
which may instead be indicative of a shared capability.

While investigating the TAG-38 intrusion activity, we
uncovered multiple links to other suspected Chinese statesponsored activity. Of note, the targeting and use of ShadowPad
is consistent with previously reported RedEcho activity, and this
latest activity also includes a repeated SLDC victim. However,
there were distinct differences in the infrastructure TTPs used
in this latest campaign, and at this time we have not identified
sufficient technical evidence tying these 2 activity groups
together beyond the common targeting sets and capability use.
