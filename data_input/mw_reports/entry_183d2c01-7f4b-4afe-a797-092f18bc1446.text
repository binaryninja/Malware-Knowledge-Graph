Executive Summary
The subscription-based malware service Prometheus TDS was first discovered
in August of 2021 by Group-IB, as part of an email campaign targeting U.S.
government agencies, amongst others. The Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS)
offering was posted by a cyber threat actor called “Ma1n” on various Russian
hack forums, to a primarily Russian customer base.

1/26

This threat actor appears to lean heavily on Cobalt Strike for part of its
infrastructure (for more information about Cobalt Strike please download our
recent book on the subject). With the data gathered from the BlackBerry
Research & Intelligence Team’s Cobalt Strike Team Server scanning solution,
we were able to cluster a variety of different malware families they’ve used,
based on Beacon configuration data.

Malware researcher for NVISO Labs Didier Stevens also recently found six SSL
private keys bundled with cracked or leaked copies of Cobalt Strike, one of
which has an extensive overlap with Prometheus-related activity. He has
published information and tooling that makes it possible to decrypt this Beacon
traffic.

Introduction
Prometheus, a supreme trickster, stole fire for humankind by lighting a torch from the sun.
What would this tale look like if it were updated, with the god of fire reimagined as a
cybercriminal?
In our gritty reboot of this classic tale, instead of a rebel bringing the light of knowledge to
humanity, the main character is the “puppetmaster” of a monstrous cephalopod that has its
tentacles wending its way around a huge territory. The torch is now a Beacon (of the
cracked/leaked Cobalt Strike variety). In our revamped plot line, there is hope at the bottom
of Pandora’s box in the form of passionate researchers working diligently to identify and
thwart these cyber-thieves.

Prometheus: The God of Fire (and TDSes?!)
In August of 2021, Group-IB published research on Prometheus TDS. They shone light on
two large email campaigns targeting U.S. entities in the public and private sector, as well as
individuals in Belgium.
Prometheus at its core is a Traffic Direction System (TDS) used to facilitate Malware-as-aService (MaaS) operations and phishing redirection on a large scale. As its name suggests,
a TDS is a system designed to (re)direct users from one web location to another, based on
the configuration set by its operator. The TDS helps to deliver malware binaries to targets
via a complex web of phishing, maldocs and HTTP redirection. The BlackBerry Research &
Intelligence Team has also discovered an interesting correlation between Prometheus and
the use of a leaked Cobalt Strike SSL key pair, which we will elaborate in more detail later.
Prometheus can be considered a full-bodied service/platform that allows threat groups to
purvey their malware or phishing operations with ease. Think of Prometheus like a freight
transport infrastructure; except instead of carrying food or petrochemicals, it carries a range

2/26

of cyber offensive capabilities and malware to its targets. The irony of this analogy is that
services like Prometheus enable bad actors to target companies that provide actual
infrastructure – such as freight transport and other critical services – in the physical world.
In order to accomplish its goals, the platform has many moving parts, from malicious PHP
backdoors to JavaScript redirects, to malspam and Cobalt Strike infrastructure, as well as
customer-facing administration web panels. Prometheus sells access to the TDS via
underground forums on a subscription basis, with its prices ranging from $30 for two days to
$250 for a month.

Catching Fire: The Prometheus TDS – Traffic Direction System
Historically, a TDS would be considered an integral part of an exploit kit’s execution chain;
they would be used to redirect an unwitting user to a "landing page" where their computer
would be fingerprinted and served with an exploit where possible. But the exploit kit (EK)
landscape has been on the decline in recent years thanks to a concerted effort by law
enforcement, browser hardening by developers, and declines in the use of Internet Explorer
(IE) and Flash.
Consequently, TDSes have evolved into their own independent entities that are largely part
of Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS) offerings, which a threat actor offers for either rent or
sale in specialized forums located on the dark web. Past examples of this are the EITest
TDS that exclusively targeted IE users, BlackTDS, which offered services for as little as
$16/day, and Seamless TDS.

Figure 1 - BlackTDS forum advertisement
TDS traffic is typically funneled from one of two main sources; malicious ads (malvertising)
on legitimate websites, or on compromised legitimate websites that contain malicious code.
Once a victim is caught in this web of redirects, they are at the mercy of the TDS and will be
3/26

redirected to a location that serves malware, phishing scams, exploit kits or tech support
scams.
The Prometheus TDS follows the typical TDS execution flow, but targets are funneled via a
spam email that contains either an HTML file, a Google Docs page or a web shell redirector.
These components each contain an embedded URL designed to redirect the user to a first
stage payload, or to a website that has been compromised by the threat actor and hosts a
PHP-based backdoor. The backdoor is used to glean various types of data from the victim,
which gets sent back to the Prometheus TDS administrative panel. The admin panel could
then choose to send instructions back to the compromised website/PHP backdoor, to serve
the victim with malware, or redirect them to another page that might contain a phishing
scam, etc.

PHP Backdoor
The Prometheus backdoor was previously an integral component in the execution chain of
the Prometheus TDS and played the role of a middleman, acting as a gateway between the
attacker and the unwitting victim. However, its use has been minimal since earlier this year.
It is a miniscule (12-16KB) PHP script that operates as an HTTP redirector, and it is often
found on compromised websites running vulnerable PHPMailer software.
A victim is typically redirected – after clicking a malicious link that is delivered to them
through a spam email – to a website infected with the backdoor. The backdoor’s primary
purpose is to fingerprint victims, scrape various pieces of data from their machine, and then
send the stolen data to the Prometheus TDS administration panel.

Figure 2 – Prometheus TDS admin panel
The admin panel can then choose to send an additional instruction to the backdoor, such as
to redirect the victim to another specified URL and/or deliver a malicious first stage payload.

Analysis
An examination of the backdoor code reveals a configuration file containing a series of
hardcoded settings for communication between the backdoor and the command-and-control
(C2) server (also running the admin panel).
4/26

Communication between both parties is encrypted via XOR, a cipher key is contained within
the configuration settings.
Also included is the C2 admin panel address – in this case “hxxp://109[.]248[.]203[.]114” –
and the installation path along with a test path location.

Figure 3 - Configuration settings
Additional settings include the presence of (“allow_url_fopen”, “1”). This is a PHP feature
that, when enabled, allows data/files to be retrieved from remote locations
over HTTP or FTP.

Figure 4 - Setting enablement
Once a victim lands on an infected site, various pieces of information are retrieved from
their browser, including their IP, geolocation, time-zone, user-agent, language, protocol
used, and the location they were referred from.

5/26

Figure 5 - User data scraping code
A request is then generated to send the newly acquired data to the attacker’s admin
panel/C2 server.

6/26

Figure 6 - C2 exfil
The server might then send a response containing additional instructions depending on the
“$modeType” chosen. Instructions include specifying a URL to redirect the victim to, or
whether to send further files/malware to them.

The Threat Actor “Ma1n” and Sales on the Dark Web
In this gritty reimagining of the Prometheus tale, there is a threat actor directing this
malicious traffic. “Main” (aka Ma1n) is considered to be the author behind the Prometheus
TDS, amongst other illicit cyber-offerings. His focus has evolved over the years, selling
various kits like PowerMTA and offering services in form of "high quality redirects". This
work and knowledge led him creating Prometheus TDS.
He has used various Russian hack forums to advertise his wares throughout 2019 and
2020, often featuring package deals to encourage customers to make larger purchases or
to make setup more convenient. Ma1n even includes a way for potential buyers to contact
him via the messaging platforms Jabber, Reserve or Telegram.
Ma1n’s favored forum avatar – a red fox – is the same fox that was featured in The Prodigy
song titled “Nasty.”

Figure 8 – Ma1n's favored avatar: the red fox
Ma1n first registered on a hacking forum on October 15, 2018. The last activity on this site
was on July 3, 2019. Ma1n posted twice and had zero reactions to any other posts,
indicating that this account meant strictly business.

On June 22, 2019, Ma1n posted again. This time he advertised high-speed SMTP based on
PowerMTA (Message Transfer Agent), redirects, and various sets of purchase packages
such as “A set of VPS + 10 additional IP addresses + 10 domains - 100+ high-speed SMTP

Stealing Fire
While Prometheus employs several bespoke offensive solutions to bring their wares to the
masses, they also appear to lean heavily on the adversary simulation and threat emulation
software known as Cobalt Strike Beacon. With the data gathered from our Cobalt Strike
Team Server scanning solution (as detailed extensively in our book “Finding Beacons in the
Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence”), we began to cluster based on specific Beacon
configuration data. We then visualized this into what we call “constellations.”
When we looked at the visualized representation of the SSL public keys, we saw one
specific constellation that dwarfed every other, comprising over 16% of our dataset at one
point in time.
The MD5 hash of this public key is e9ae865f5ce035176457188409f6020a.

15/26

Figure 17 – Over 4000 IPs clustered with the SSL public key
Such a large cluster couldn’t help but draw the eye; we wondered what could be
responsible for such a large representation in our dataset. Was it one singular threat actor
with a huge array of infrastructure? Doubtful. Was each Beacon being distributed by a
botnet? Maybe. Was it a cracked copy being distributed on the dark web? Now we’re on to
something.
Didier Stevens (of the InfoSec hall-of-fame), recently published that he found six SSL
private keys in the wild that were used as part of malicious Cobalt Strike installations. One
private key in particular was the respective counterpart to our
e9ae865f5ce035176457188409f6020apublic key: it was bundled within a cracked version of
Cobalt Strike 4.2. When investigating known intrusions between Team Servers and
Beacons relating to this SSL key, we noticed extensive overlap with Prometheus-related
activity.

16/26

This cracked version (and the SSL key) appears to be so heavily relied upon by
Prometheus affiliates that we speculate that this same illegitimate copy of Cobalt Strike
could perhaps be proliferated by the Prometheus operators themselves. We also found that
by using clustering mechanisms such as the PROC_INJ_STUB value (which tracks the
Cobalt Strike Team Server JAR) we can infer that the SSL key was migrated between
version 4.2 to 4.4. This suggests that an entity had a desire to maintain access to Beacons
across multiple versions.
While we cannot say for certain, it’s possible that someone connected with the Prometheus
TDS is maintaining this cracked copy and providing it upon purchase. It is also possible that
this cracked installation may be provided as part of a standard playbook or a virtual
machine (VM) installation.

Figure 18 – Breakdown of Cobalt Strike versions using the leaked SSL public key
In subsequent blog posts regarding the SSL private keys, Stevens showed how you can
decrypt the network traffic between the Beacon and its respective Team Server if one of
these keys is in use. Any Cobalt Strike beacon found to be using any of the corresponding
public keys – in this case the Prometheus TDS – can have its network traffic decrypted.
This can help quite significantly in understanding the extent of a related breach, and to
enable further investigation into those responsible.
While we can’t directly tie this cracked version of Cobalt Strike to the Prometheus TDS, we
can however show the number of threat actors who have been observed using this specific
copy over the last two years. The number of groups that have used this installation who are
believed to be of Russian origin is particularly noteworthy.
The diagram in Figure 20 below displays a timeline of the various families and types of
malwares that have been seen in conjunction with Cobalt Strike using this SSL key pair,
from early 2020 to present.

17/26

Figure 19 - Malware observed using the cracked Cobalt Strike SSL key pair
In one of our previous publications, we saw the same SSL key being used by Zebra2104,
an initial access broker whose services were used by groups such as Strong Pity,
MountLocker and Phobos. For more on this, see our recent blog on the group.

Pandora’s Box
While the previous figure shows the different malware associated with the leaked SSL
public key, it does not imply that all of these threats have any direct association with
Prometheus.
However, after careful research into overlaps between the leaked key and malware
deployed via Prometheus TDS, we have concluded that the following campaigns are likely
to have recently utilized Cobalt Strike AND Prometheus.

DarkCrystal RAT
DarkCrystal RAT (or DCRAT for short) is a lightweight commercial Russian Remote Access
Trojan (RAT) that was first seen in in the wild in 2018. It is one of the cheaper commercial
malwares of its kind available on the Russian market, with recent prices ranging from 500
Rub ($6/€6) for two months to 4200 Rub ($57/€50) for a lifetime license.
This RAT employs a client-server architecture, with the client written in C# and the server
written in JPHP. DCRAT is regularly updated with new features and plugins. Someone using
the handle [at]DarkCrystalRAT maintains a news page on Telegram that provides regular
updates as to the continuous development of the RAT.

18/26

Figure 20 - DarkCrystal RAT news channel
Once installed on a victim machine, DCRAT provides an attacker with a wide array of
functionality, including keylogging, webcam and microphone manipulation, plus file and
folder manipulation. It also provides a large list of plugins that add further feature
enhancements, such as browser password scraping, anti-VM capabilities, crypto-stealing,
notifications sent to the threat actor via Telegram, and privilege escalation.

FickerStealer

19/26

FickerStealer is an advanced Rust-based information-stealing malware. It was first
advertised for sale and marketed as a MaaS on underground forums in August of 2020, by
its namesake author.

Figure 21 - FickerStealer author alias

Figure 22 - FickerStealer Russian forum advertisement
Prices for FickerStealer service ranges from $90 to $900 USD, depending on the
subscription length.
Upon subscribing to the service, the would-be attacker is provided with the necessary
components to set up and configure the malware for their specific malicious goals.
FickerStealer has an added degree of difficulty when being analyzed, due to its being
written in the obscure programming language Rust. That obstacle is further compounded by
being heavily obfuscated.
FickerStealer is designed to pilfer a variety of sensitive data from a victim’s machine, which
is then encrypted and exfiltrated to the attacker’s C2. This includes information such as
credit card data, and user login credentials, as well as browser and cryptocurrency wallet
information. It gathers this information by targeting a host of commonly used applications

20/26

such as Chrome, FireFox, WinSCP, FileZilla and Discord. FickerStealer can also manipulate
files and folders on the compromised machine, and it can download additional files or
malware if instructed to do so by an attacker.

Cerber
Cerber ransomware first appeared on the threat landscape in 2016, being offered for sale in
Russian forums using a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. It was initially distributed
via exploit kit or spam emails and weaponized document attachments.
An attacker can fully customize the threat via an embedded configuration file.
Upon execution, Cerber first geolocates the infected machine in order to compare the
location with a list of exempted countries. This list is mostly comprised of eastern European
and ex-Soviet states.
This threat then creates a copy of itself in %Appdata%. After this, it creates persistence via
the Registry, deletes shadow copies, and begins the encryption process employing RSA
encryption. Upon completion of encryption, a ransom note is dropped to all affected folders,
and the machine’s wallpaper is set to relay the same information contained in the ransom
note. Initial variants of Cerber appended a ".cerber" file extension to encrypted files.
At its peak in the year after it had launched, Cerber was responsible for 26% of all
ransomware infections during the holiday season of 2016. It was still active in Fall 2021,
accounting for 5% of ransomware infections, gaining it sixth place in a Top 10 list of most
prevalent ransomware families according to Bitdefender.

Sodin/REvil
REvil (also known as Sodinokibi or Sodin) is a prolific RaaS group that first emerged on the
threat landscape in the aftermath of Gandcrab ransomware group ceasing operations. It is
considered to be a successor of Gandcrab, or at least developed by the same authors, due
to similarities in their code.
REvil uses the exploitation of vulnerabilities and spam emails as an infection vector. Once
executed on a machine, it will attempt to escalate privileges via the exploitation of CVE2018-8453. It will also kill a list of blacklisted processes, wipe the contents of a list of
blacklisted folders (if it’s configured to do so), and delete shadow copies. It begins file
encryption with exceptions only granted to those files and folders specified on its
configurations whitelist, with a set list of countries – mostly made up of eastern European
and ex-Soviet states – being exempted. Encryption is performed using the Salsa20 stream
cipher. Post encryption, a ransom note is dropped to all affected directories on the host.

21/26

REvil has also been known to employ double extortion tactics, where the attacker threatens
to publish the victim’s data on a leak site located in the dark web, should they not pay the
ransom before a set deadline.

Ryuk/Wizard Spider
Wizard Spider is a Russian based cyber threat group that has been in operation since at
least 2014. They are best known for being the operators behind the Trickbot malware
family.
In the latter half of 2018, they began deploying Ryuk ransomware. In a lot of instances, they
used Trickbot to install Ryuk on compromised systems.
Ryuk is itself a variant and evolution of the Hermes ransomware, and it was primarily used
to target larger, enterprise-sized corporations to extort larger ransoms. This practice is
colloquially known as "big game hunting."
Upon detonation, Ryuk first tries to kill a comprehensive list of processes and 150-plus
services to make the next stage of its infection run as smoothly as possible. File encryption
is performed using the RSA-4096 cipher, and a ransom note is dropped to each affected
directory.
Ryuk contains the ability to encrypt files remotely, and it can also perform Wake-on-LAN
(WoL) functionality. This feature enables attackers to wake up networked devices that are
offline, so that they can be targeted for encryption.

BlackMatter
BlackMatter ransomware was first spotted in the wild in July 2021. It is being offered as a
RaaS on dark web forums. There has been some speculation that BlackMatter was a
successor to DarkSide ransomware. However, in an interview with one of the
representatives from the ransomware group, the representative said that while they have
previously worked together with some of the members from DarkSide, they are no longer
doing so.
In May 2021, BlackMatter was looking for initial access brokers (IABs) to provide initial
access. BlackMatter was very specific about what kind of targets the threat group was
looking for: the target had to be a large, English-speaking company with annual revenue of
$100-plus million.
BlackMatter also had an exemption list defining which types of industries and organization it
had excluded from attack. These included hospitals, critical infrastructure facilities (such as
nuclear power plants, power plants, and water treatment plants), companies in the oil and
gas industries, and those in the defense, non-profit and government sectors.

22/26

However, on Nov. 1, 2021, BlackMatter posted on their page (which is currently offline) that
they have decided to close their operations due to pressure from the authorities. They
stated that each affected organization would receive a decryption tool.
During their time of operation, BlackMatter targeted both Linux® and Windows® operating
systems.
File encryption was achieved using Salsa20 and RSA-1024 encryption algorithms. Only the
first megabyte of the file was encrypted, to speed up the encryption process on the victim's
machine.

Qakbot
Qakbot is a mature malware family that dates back as far as 2007. Constant development
and support for the malware has seen it stand the test of time, and it is still one of the most
prominent botnets today. Qakbot has several affiliates who disseminate the malware via a
combination of malspam and malicious Microsoft® Office documents, not to mention via the
Prometheus TDS.
During its lengthy tenure, Qakbot has become quite a formidable foe. It includes a large
amount of anti-VM and anti-sandbox functionality on both the client and server-side. This is
done to hinder analysis efforts by researchers. Thus, Qakbot has been able to stay
competitive with security solutions by combining its anti-analysis functionality with a high
degree of modularity in the form of credential harvesting modules, worm modules, and
webhooks, among others.
If that wasn’t bad enough, Qakbot has been known to drop other malware binaries on victim
machines. These include several ransomware families used primarily for financial gain, as
well as binaries from other infamous botnets to help to increase their victim-base.

And More!
As highlighted in the aforementioned Group-IB report, other threat groups including MAN1,
FIN7 and IcedID have also been distributed by Prometheus. We further explore the
correlations between these groups in our recent book, “Finding Beacons in the Dark: A
Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence.”

Insights
Searching across our customers' data for signs of Prometheus/Cobalt Strike-related activity
reveals some interesting trends. The list of inbound TCP ports shows evidence of port
scanning, with threat actors performing reconnaissance of Internet-facing infrastructure. In
all likelihood, they are doing so in search of one of the greatest Achilles’ heels for
organizations - remotely exploitable services.

23/26

The top inbound port, 3389, highlights threat actors’ propensity to leverage remote desktop
protocol (RDP) with credentials after establishing a foothold. Several Prometheus-related
Team Servers were found to be operating as RDP jump stations.

Figure 23 – Top inbound TCP ports
Outbound TCP connections are largely as expected: Beacon traffic on standard web ports.
One slight anomaly is outbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 from various Apache Tomcat
servers to a couple of related IPs:

24/26

Figure 24 – Outbound traffic
Unfortunately, we were unable to recover process dumps from these systems, so we can
only speculate as to whether this activity is indicative of a Tomcat vulnerability being
leveraged to load Beacon payloads, or the operation of a web shell.
Finally, across all campaigns using the leaked build of Team Server, there seems to be a
tendency to target organizations within the public sector:

Stuck in the Middle With You
In an interesting twist of fate, as we were preparing this blog, Didier Stevens of NVISO Labs
released a multi-part blog series where he talks about decrypting Cobalt Strike traffic using
known private keys. For us, there was a big revelation when we realized that Stevens had
found the corresponding private key to the public key we had been using to cluster
“Prometheus”-related threat groups and malspam campaigns.
For analysts and investigators, this means that for all the threat groups listed in this blog (as
well as many more, as this is the most prominent public/private key pair, after all), it is now
possible to decrypt the Beacon C2 traffic by using Stevens' processes and tooling. We
encourage any incident responders dealing with recent Conti/Ryuk/BlackMatter/Cerber
incidents who are in possession of Cobalt Strike PCAPs to give it a try.
What is more, Stevens also released a subsequent tool enabling the user to man-in-themiddle (MITM) live Beacon communications that use one of the known private keys,
including injecting your own commands.
There’s hope at the bottom of the box!
