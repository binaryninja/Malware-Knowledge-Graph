scripts/prox.sh:
Sanitize messed up deepl json translations as much as we can with simple bash
scripting.

scripts/recursive_prox.sh
prox.sh but recursive.

Some strings are not properly translated by google so I will upload the original splitted pdfs
too if you want to translate them with a better translator or with a better format.
If you have deepl pro access and want to help it would be great to translate them at deepl which handles documents and some languages much better-. You can download the original
pdfs, translate them, and create an issue uploading the translated pdfs so I can commit them
to the repo.
Big thanks to @Nathannaelc for providing deepl translated pdf documents and json files.
Also big thanks to @offsecginger for providing json conversions of google translated pdf
documents.
Yet again big thanks to @tsale for his repo google translated rocket chat files and google
translated trickbot forum files are his work.
