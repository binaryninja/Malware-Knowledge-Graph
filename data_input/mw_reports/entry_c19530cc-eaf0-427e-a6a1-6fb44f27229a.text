Flashes (Alerts)

Abstract
IBM has detected that some USB flash drives containing the initialization tool shipped with
the IBM Storwize V3500, V3700 and V5000 Gen 1 systems contain a file that has been
infected with malicious code.

Content
Affected Products
The Initialization Tool on the USB flash drive with the partnumber 01AC585 that shipped with
the following System models may have an infected file:
IBM Storwize V3500 - 2071 models 02A and 10A
IBM Storwize V3700 - 2072 models 12C, 24C and 2DC
IBM Storwize V5000 - 2077 models 12C and 24C
IBM Storwize V5000 - 2078 models 12C and 24C
IBM Storwize Systems with serial numbers starting with the characters 78D2 are not
affected.
Neither the IBM Storwize storage systems nor data stored on these systems are infected by
this malicious code.
Systems not listed above and USB flash drives used for Encryption Key management are not
affected by this issue.
Impact Potential
IBM has identified a malicious file distributed on USB flash drives used in the initialization
tool for IBM Storwize V3500, V3700 and V5000 Gen 1 systems.
When the initialization tool is launched from the USB flash drive, the tool copies itself to a
temporary folder on the hard drive of the desktop or laptop during normal operation. With that
step, the malicious file is copied with the initialization tool to the following temporary folder:
On Windows systems: %TMP%\initTool
On Linux and Mac systems: /tmp/initTool
1/5

Important: While the malicious file is copied onto the desktop or laptop, the file is not
executed during initialization.
The affected Initialization USB flash drive looks like the images below, and contains a folder
called InitTool.

2/5

IBM has taken steps to prevent any additional USB flash drives being shipped with this
issue.

Client Actions
If you have used the initialization USB flash drive from one of the IBM products listed above
and have inserted it into a desktop or laptop to initialize a Storwize system, IBM recommends
you verify your antivirus software has already removed the infected file or alternatively
remove the directory containing the identified malicious file in the manner described below.
IBM recommends ensuring your antivirus products are updated, configured to scan
temporary directories, and issues identified by the antivirus product are addressed.
To manually remove the malicious file, delete the temporary directory:
On Windows systems: %TMP%\initTool
On Linux and Mac systems: /tmp/initTool
In addition for Windows systems, ensure the entire directory is deleted (not moved to the
Recycle Bin folder). This can be accomplished by selecting the directory and Shift->Rightclick->Delete the directory.
Further, for Initialization Tool USB flash drives, including those that have not yet been used
for installation, IBM recommends taking one of the following steps:
1. Securely destroy the USB flash drive so that it can not be reused.
2. Repair the USB flash drive so it can be reused:
1. Delete the folder called InitTool on the USB flash drive which will delete the folder
and all the files inside.If using a Windows machine, holding down shift when
deleting the folder will ensure that the files are permanently deleted rather than
being copied to the recycle bin.
2. Download the Initialization tool package from FixCentral
https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral.
3. Unzip the package onto the USB flash drive.
4. Manually scan the USB flash drive with antivirus software.
Further Information
