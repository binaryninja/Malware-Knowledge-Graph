New Evidence Proves Ongoing WIZARD SPIDER / LUNAR SPIDER
Collaboration

Brendon Feeley and Brett Stone-Gross Research & Threat Intel

On March 17, 2019, CrowdStrike® Intelligence observed the use of a new BokBot (developed
and operated by LUNAR SPIDER) proxy module in conjunction with TrickBot (developed and
operated by WIZARD SPIDER), which may provide WIZARD SPIDER with additional tools to
steal sensitive information and conduct fraudulent wire transfers. This activity also provides
further evidence to support the existence of a flourishing relationship between these two
actors.
WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot banking malware began distributing a new proxy module named
shadDll to group tags (gtags) prefixed with sin and tin . These gtags have previously
been associated with LUNAR SPIDER’s BokBot (a.k.a. IcedID) malware, which was
discussed in a previous blog.

1/5

The module contains identical functionality to that of the BokBot proxy module. The new proxy
module incorporates many of the most potent BokBot features within the extensible, modular
framework of the TrickBot malware. Binary code analysis revealed that the shadDll
TrickBot module is 81 percent similar to the BokBot proxy module with 99 percent
confidence.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
This new TrickBot module, shadDll , is primarily responsible for performing man-in-themiddle (MITM) attacks against web browsers on infected hosts, achieved by hooking
networking functions and installing illegitimate SSL certificates. Once the malware is able to
intercept SSL traffic, it can use the various BokBot configuration entries to strategically
redirect web traffic, inject code, take screenshots, and otherwise manipulate victims’ browsing
experience.
The shadDll module contains typical characteristics of a TrickBot module. More explicitly,
the modules are dynamic link libraries (DLLs), they contain no TrickBot encrypted strings, and
they have the standard TrickBot exports of Start, Control and Release . Although the
shadDll module contains no TrickBot-encrypted strings, it does contain strings obfuscated
using the custom XOR encoding used in the BokBot proxy module.

Hard-Coded DN Values
Of particular interest is the following hard-coded distinguished name (DN) values, which are
identical to the ones found within the illegitimate certificates that the BokBot proxy module
uses for performing MITM attacks.
C=US; O=VeriSign, Inc.; OU=VeriSign Trust Network; OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign,
Inc. - For authorized use only; CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary
Certification Authority - G5

Further Solidification of Two eCrime Groups
This development between WIZARD SPIDER and LUNAR SPIDER further solidifies the
connection between the two groups, which stretches back to the Dyre (a.k.a. Dyreza) and
Neverquest era. CrowdStrike Intelligence will continue to monitor this intriguing working
relationship and mutual integration. A detailed analysis of the BokBot proxy module that is
now being distributed by TrickBot is presented in this follow-up blog post.
