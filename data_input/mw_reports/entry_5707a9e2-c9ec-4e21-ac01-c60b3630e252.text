CISA.gov Services Report

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) continue to respond to the recent supplychain ransomware attack leveraging a vulnerability in Kaseya VSA software against multiple
managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers. CISA and FBI strongly urge
affected MSPs and their customers to follow the guidance below.
CISA and FBI recommend affected MSPs:
Download the Kaseya VSA Detection Tool. This tool analyzes a system (either VSA
server or managed endpoint) and determines whether any indicators of compromise
(IOCs) are present.
Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on every single account that is
under the control of the organization, and—to the maximum extent possible—enable
and enforce MFA for customer-facing services.
Implement allowlisting to limit communication with remote monitoring and management
(RMM) capabilities to known IP address pairs, and/or
1/2

Place administrative interfaces of RMM behind a virtual private network (VPN) or a
firewall on a dedicated administrative network.
CISA and FBI recommend MSP customers affected by this attack take immediate action to
implement the following cybersecurity best practices. Note: these actions are especially
important for MSP customers who do not currently have their RMM service running due to
the Kaseya attack.
CISA and FBI recommend affected MSP customers:
Ensure backups are up to date and stored in an easily retrievable location that is airgapped from the organizational network;
Revert to a manual patch management process that follows vendor remediation
guidance, including the installation of new patches as soon as they become available;
Implement:
Multi-factor authentication; and
Principle of least privilege on key network resources admin accounts.
