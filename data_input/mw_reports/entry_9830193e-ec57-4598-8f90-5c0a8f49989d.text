A new email campaign designed to spread the Vidar spyware package uses a novel
technique involving Microsoft Compiled HTML help files, according to a blog post released
today by Trustwave.
The help files, which use the suffix “CHM,” are packaged in an ISO along with the Vidar
payload in what appears to be a Word document. If the attacker successfully hoodwinks the
target into extracting the phony document, executing either file triggers the malicious
package and compromises the system, Trustwave researcher Diana Lopera wrote in the
post.
The CHM file used in the attack is mostly a copy of a legitimate CHM, but has appended
HTML application code – that extra code silently runs the malicious executable in the
background when the CHM file is run.

The particular flavor of Vidar used in the attack, Lopera noted, is version 50.3, and receives
its command-and-control (C&C) instructions from accounts on open-source social networking
platform Mastodon. Once up and running, the malware downloads configuration information
from C&C servers identified by the Mastodon page and starts its work – first collecting
system information and password data from browsers and other applications, sending that
information as a ZIP file back to the C&C server, and then deleting itself, potentially after
pulling additional malware onto the infected machine.
“Appending a malicious file to an unsuspecting file format is one of the tricks our adversaries
use to evade detection,” wrote Lopera.

What is Vidar?
Vidar was first observed in the wild in late 2018, according to a report from cloud security
vendor Infoblox, which noted that it’s a variant of the earlier Arkei infostealer. It’s sold
commercially in online forums, and has the ability to steal a wide variety of user information
and valuable data from infected computers, including credit card numbers, usernames and
passwords, desktop screenshots, and cryptocurrency wallets. It can even bypass some
types of two-factor authentication, particularly targeting the Authy 2FA stack.
As ever, strong email security practices can mitigate or eliminate the risks posed by Vidar –
extreme caution should be used when opening email attachments from unfamiliar senders
with generic subject lines, and verification either over the phone or in person should be the
first move if there is any doubt about such a message’s legitimacy.
