In the previous blog in this series, we extracted behavioral TTPs, prepared the attack
emulation, and executed it.

It’s time for analyzing the logs, validating/modifying the hypotheses that we generated after
reading the report(or generating new ones), generating detection strategies, and developing
detections.

Analyzing the Logs
I analyzed the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs, but you can check Sysmon or your EDR
logs. Although there can be other events generated during the attack, below are the most
important ones for me to generate or validate hypotheses:

1. Mounting an ISO image generates the below Registry event:

2. Opening the mounted image generates a file creation event:

I mounted the ISO twice.

3. Double-clicking the shortcut file generates the below process
execution events:

4. Execution of the payload(BOOM.exe) generates a network
connection event:

Validating/Modifying the Hypotheses
I already generated some hypotheses after reading the report. Alternatively, you can
generate your hypotheses after the emulation and analysis of the logs.
I intentionally skipped some hypotheses as they were fragile. For example:
Outlook creating an HTML file (can be bypassed with a .zip)
rundll32 execution (can be replaced by another technique)
To me, generating as few hypotheses as possible with enough coverage to detect the attack
is important(less is more + Pareto). If I can cover almost all possibilities with a few
hypotheses, it will make my life easy.
Going back to the attack, since we have the folder name, we can use it for finalizing our
hypotheses.

Final hypotheses
1. ISO file creation is highly suspicious on non-IT users’ computers
2. Process execution under a mounted drive can be highly suspicious
3. Network connection from a process that runs under a mounted drive can be highly
suspicious
We need to check if these hypotheses generate hide fidelity results. To check the 2. and 3.
hypotheses, we need to correlate the Registry event with process creation and network
connection events. This is possible if you can query logs and generate new fields.
After analyzing the logs historically, I saw all three hypotheses were valid and would
generate high fidelity results.

Creating Detections
I’ve created 3 queries for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, 3 queries for Azure Sentinel
(Sysmon) and published them in my GitHub repo. You can use the same logic on your own
tool.

Conclusion
3/4

In this post, I used a different approach for TTP extraction without fully using the MITRE
ATT&CK framework and wanted to show alternative ways of detecting attacks. I also wanted
to show detecting Initial Access is still possible. I hope you stop assuming the breach and
start hunting/detecting initial access as an additional effort in your threat management
program.
I’ll keep posting blogs about initial access detection. Stay tuned…
