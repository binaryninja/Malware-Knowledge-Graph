Second New 'IsaacWiper' Data Wiper Targets Ukraine After
Russian Invasion

A new data wiper malware has been observed deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian
government network, a day after destructive cyber attacks struck multiple entities in the country
preceding the start of Russia's military invasion.
Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new malware "IsaacWiper," which it said was detected
on February 24 in an organization that was not affected by HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade), another
data wiping malware that targeted several organizations on February 23 as part of a sabotage
operation aimed at rendering the machines unusable.
Further analysis of the HermeticWiper attacks, which infected at least five Ukrainian organizations,
have revealed a worm constituent that propagates the malware across the compromised network
and a ransomware module that acts as a "distraction from the wiper attacks," corroborating a prior
report from Symantec.

"These destructive attacks leveraged at least three components: HermeticWiper for wiping the data,
HermeticWizard for spreading on the local network, and HermeticRansom acting as a decoy
ransomware," the company said.
In a separate analysis of the new Golang-based ransomware, Russian cybersecurity company
Kaspersky, which codenamed the malware "Elections GoRansom," characterized it as a last-minute
operation, adding it was "likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its nonsophisticated style and poor implementation."
As an anti-forensic measure, HermeticWiper is also designed to hinder analysis by erasing itself
from the disk by overwriting its own file with random bytes.

ESET said it hasn't been able to find "any tangible connection" to attribute these attacks to a known
threat actor. But the malware artifacts unearthed so far make it clear that the intrusions had been
planned for several months, with the targeted entities suffering compromises well in advance of the
wiper's deployment.

"This is based on several facts: the HermeticWiper PE compilation timestamps, the oldest being
December 28, 2021; the code-signing certificate issue date of April 13, 2021; and the deployment of
HermeticWiper through the default domain policy in at least one instance, suggesting the attackers
had prior access to one of that victim's Active Directory servers," said Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET head
of threat research.

Also unknown are the initial access vectors used to deploy both the wipers, although it's suspected
that the attackers leveraged tools like Impacket and RemCom, a remote access software, for lateral
movement and malware distribution.
Furthermore, IsaacWiper shares no code-level overlaps with HermeticWiper and is substantially
less sophisticated, even as it sets out to enumerate all the physical and logical drives before
proceeding to carry out its file wiping operations.

"On February 25, 2022, attackers dropped a new version of IsaacWiper with debug logs," the
researchers said. "This may indicate that the attackers were unable to wipe some of the targeted
machines and added log messages to understand what was happening."
Update: Microsoft, which is tracking HermeticWiper under the name FoxBlade (and
HermeticRansom as SonicVote), said the "intended objective of these attacks is the disruption,
degradation, and destruction of targeted resources" in Ukraine.
The infections impacted "hundreds of systems spanning multiple government, information
technology, financial sector, and energy organizations predominantly located in or with a nexus to
Ukraine," it noted.
The tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has attributed the attacks to an emerging threat
cluster designated as DEV-0665, pointing out its lack of affiliation to a previously known threat
activity group. It's worth noting here that the actor responsible for the WhisperGate wiper attacks in
January is known as DEV-0586.
Assigning IsaacWiper-related intrusions the moniker Lasainraw, Microsoft also characterized them
as a "limited destructive malware attack," adding it's "continuing to investigate this incident and has
not currently linked it to known threat activity."
