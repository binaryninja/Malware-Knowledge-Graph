Since the DarkSide ransomware operation shut down a week ago, multiple affiliates have
complained about not getting paid for past services and issued a claim for bitcoins in
escrow at a hacker forum.
Russian-language cybercriminal communities typically have an escrow system to avoid
scams between sellers and buyers. For ransomware operations, the deposit is a clear
statement that they mean big business.
To gain the trust of potential partners and expand the operation, DarkSide deposited 22
bitcoins on the popular hacker forum XSS. The wallet is managed by the site’s
administrator, which in this case acts as a guarantor for the gang and an arbitrator if a
dispute occurs.

REvil ransomware last year deposited $1 million worth of Bitcoin to a different hacking
forum to attract new recruits into the operation. This move showed that they trusted the
forum administrator with the money and that there was plenty of money to be made.
Last week, DarkSide closed shop and informed affiliates that the decision came after losing
access to their public-facing servers and it was "due to the pressure from the US" after the
attack on Colonial Pipeline.

Unpaid debts
DarkSide’s dissolving of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation was abrupt and
clearly left some unfinished business. Five partners have complained that the operators
owed them money from paid ransoms or from hacking services:
The first affiliate asking for claim states that they were the 'pentester' for an attack and
was owed 80% of the ransom payment. However, after the victim paid, the DarkSide
operators stated they no longer had access to the funds and the affiliate could use the
deposit at XSS to receive payment
The second affiliate states that they had bitcoins left for them on the affiliate portal but
had to rush to their relatives before they could claim them
A third affiliate states that they too were a 'pentester' and had a ransom payment right
before the DarkSide operation shut down. This affiliate states they sent proof to the
XSS admin
A fourth affiliate states that they worked on corporate breaches but never received
their last $150,000 payment
The fifth and final affiliate states that there was a $72,000 made to them on the
affiliate portal but could not collect it before the operation closed due to health reasons
In the case of the first claim issued on March 14, the forum administrator who is acting as
arbitrator, approved compensation from DarkSide’s deposit. They also asked others to
come forward if they have cause.
Four days later, the second claim appeared, followed by another three on March 19 and 20.
None of these received a reply from the forum administrator.
DarkSide became known in August 2020 and became one of the most prolific ransomware
groups. In nine months, the operation made at least $90 million from ransoms.
In just one week, the gang collected about $9 million from two attacks: Colonial Pipeline
and German chemical distribution company Brenntag.
Even if DarkSide shut down, there are still victims being extorted. Affiliates have received
the corresponding decryption keys to continue negotiations with victim companies
separately.
