The Impact of Modern Ransomware on Manufacturing
Networks

As a graphical interface, HMIs are extremely reliant on image files. Every button, value,
logo, pipe, and piece of equipment represented in the HMI has a corresponding image file
somewhere in the HMI software’s directory. Not only that, configurations that contain values,
mappings, logic, thresholds, and lexicons are stored in text files alongside the image files. In
one ransomware incident that affected an HMI, we found that 88% of the encrypted files
were JPEG, BMP, or GIF files — the images used by the HMI to render the interface. If all of
these files were encrypted, recovering the affected systems would not just end with a
reinstallation of the ICS software. Additionally, the custom HMI or SCADA interface would
need to be restored as well.
Take note that ransomware does not need to directly target the ICS software’s processes in
order to incapacitate the ICS. By encrypting the files that the HMI, SCADA, or engineering
workstation (EWS) depends on, ransomware can render the system useless, resulting in
both a Loss of View and Loss of Control scenario for the operator, and ultimately, Loss of
Productivity and Revenue for the factory.
Theft of Operational Information

Networked file sharing is practically a necessity in manufacturing environments. On the
operational side of things, engineers and designers use it not only as a means to share
design and engineering documents that they are working on, but also as a repository for
reference files, guidelines, parts lists, tooling, and workflow.
On the business operational side of things, managers and staff use network shares to store
information about vendors, suppliers, purchase orders, invoices, and the like. A dedicated
supply chain management (SCM), and/or product life cycle management (PLM) system and
its associated databases could even be found on Level 4 or 5.
Although a ransomware attack that affects these file repositories and databases would not
necessarily disrupt the production line, it would hamper business operations, supply chain
management, and product engineering and design. Unfortunately, those are only the shortterm consequences. Modern ransomware operations also involve data theft, which leaves a
permanent impact.
In a trend started by the Maze ransomware, it is now almost standard practice for
ransomware groups to steal data from their victims, utilizing off-the-shelf file backup tools to
do the job. Initially, the purpose of this was to increase the likelihood of payment by the
victim, as the data leak allows for the additional threat of blackmail. However, data from
ransomware victims is also being leaked to or sold in the underground. This is particularly
unfortunate for enterprises since design and engineering documents could contain
intellectual property. In addition, vendor and supplier information could contain confidential
supply chain data such as pricing and order information.
Manufacturing companies should consider these possibilities in case they ever face a
ransomware incident. Once the production and business operations are restored, an
assessment of stolen data needs to be done. Afterward, organizations should ask
themselves a painful question: If the data is leaked or sold, what would the repercussions be
for production, business relationships, and customers? The answers to this would guide an
organization’s post-mortem actions and enable a more effective response strategy.
Post-Intrusion Ransomware
Over the years, there has been a dramatic decrease in incidents of ransomware arriving as
email attachments or being installed through malicious websites (see Figure 4). However,
judging by news headlines, many might think that the amount of ransomware being
distributed at large has not decreased at all.
Ransomware
Ransomware threats have disrupted the manufacturing industry significantly in 2020. In a
disturbing trend during the third quarter of the year, attackers appeared to be singling out
manufacturing organizations as a victim of choice in their ransomware operations.
