Spying tools and operational protocols detailed in the recent Vault 7 leak have been used in
cyberattacks against at least 40 targets in 16 different countries by a group Symantec calls
Longhorn. Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn’s tools for the past three
years and has continued to track the group in order to learn more about its tools, tactics, and
procedures.
The tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical speciﬁcations laid
out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks. The Longhorn group shares some of the same
cryptographic protocols speciﬁed in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to following leaked
guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. Given the close similarities between the tools and
techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7 documents are the
work of the same group.

Who is Longhorn?
Longhorn has been active since at least 2011. It has used a range of back door Trojans in
addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has inﬁltrated
governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the ﬁnancial,
telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors.
All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.
Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia,
and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following
infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected
unintentionally.

The link to Vault 7
A number of documents disclosed by WikiLeaks outline speciﬁcations and requirements for
malware tools. One document is a development timeline for a piece of malware called Fluxwire,
containing a changelog of dates for when new features were incorporated. These dates align
closely with the development of one Longhorn tool (Trojan.Corentry) tracked by Symantec. New
features in Corentry consistently appeared in samples obtained by Symantec either on the same
date listed in the Vault 7 document or several days later, leaving little doubt that Corentry is the
malware described in the leaked document.
Early versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the ﬁle path for the
Fluxwire program database (PDB) ﬁle. The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the
PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0.

Up until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC. According to the Vault 7
document, Fluxwire switched to a MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This
was reﬂected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015 had used
MSVC as a compiler.

A second Vault 7 document details Fire and Forget, a speciﬁcation for user-mode injection of a
payload by a tool called Archangel. The speciﬁcation of the payload and the interface used to
load it was closely matched in another Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor.
A third document outlines cryptographic protocols that malware tools should follow. These include
the use of inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, key
exchange once per connection, and use of AES with a 32-byte key. These requirements align

with the cryptographic practices observed by Symantec in all of the Longhorn tools.
Other Vault 7 documents outline tradecraft practices to be used, such as use of the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) as a means of command and control (C&C) communications, employing
wipe-on-use as standard practice, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deploymenttime key for string obfuscation, and the use of secure erase protocols involving renaming and
overwriting. Symantec has observed Longhorn tools following all of these practices. While other
malware families are known to use some of these practices, the fact that so many of them are
followed by Longhorn makes it noteworthy.

Global reach: Longhorn’s operations
While active since at least 2011, with some evidence of activity dating back as far as 2007,
Longhorn ﬁrst came to Symantec’s attention in 2014 with the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor.
The malware had all the hallmarks of a sophisticated cyberespionage group. Aside from access
to zero-day exploits, the group had preconﬁgured Plexor with elements that indicated prior
knowledge of the target environment.
To date, Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets spread across 16
different countries. Symantec has seen Longhorn use four different malware tools against its
targets: Corentry, Plexor, Backdoor.Trojan.LH1, and Backdoor.Trojan.LH2.
Before deploying malware to a target, the Longhorn group will preconﬁgure it with what appears
to be target-speciﬁc code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses for communications
back to the attackers. Longhorn tools have embedded capitalized code words, internally
referenced as “groupid” and “siteid”, which may be used to identify campaigns and victims. Over
40 of these identiﬁers have been observed, and typically follow the theme of movies, characters,
food, or music. One example was a nod to the band The Police, with the code words REDLIGHT
and ROXANNE used.
Longhorn’s malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control of the infected
computer. Most of the malware can also be customized with additional plugins and modules,
some of which have been observed by Symantec.
Longhorn’s malware appears to be speciﬁcally built for espionage-type operations, with detailed
system ﬁngerprinting, discovery, and exﬁltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of
operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on
exﬁltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the
radar during intrusions.
For C&C servers, Longhorn typically conﬁgures a speciﬁc domain and IP address combination
per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy
services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies
offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with
C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect
communications from identiﬁcation.

Longhorn: Tools used by cyberespionage group linked to Vault 7 | Symantec Connect Community

Prior to the Vault 7 leak, Symantec’s assessment of Longhorn was that it was a well-resourced
organization which was involved in intelligence gathering operations. This assessment was based
on its global range of targets and access to a range of comprehensively developed malware and
zero-day exploits. The group appeared to work a standard Monday to Friday working week,
based on timestamps and domain name registration dates, behavior which is consistent with
state-sponsored groups.
Symantec’s analysis uncovered a number of indicators that Longhorn was from an Englishspeaking, North American country. The acronym MTWRFSU (Monday Tuesday Wednesday
ThuRsday Friday Saturday SUnday) was used to conﬁgure which day of the week malware would
communicate with the attackers. This acronym is common in academic calendars in North
America. Some of the code words found in the malware, such as SCOOBYSNACK, would be
most familiar in North America. In addition to this, the compilation times of tools with reliable
timestamps indicate a time zone in the Americas.

Distinctive ﬁngerprints
Longhorn has used advanced malware tools and zero-day vulnerabilities to inﬁltrate a string of
targets worldwide. Taken in combination, the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by
Longhorn are distinctive and unique to this group, leaving little doubt about its link to Vault 7.
Throughout its investigation of Longhorn, Symantec’s priority has been protection of its
customers. Through identifying different strains of Longhorn malware, connecting them to a single
actor, and learning more about the group’s tactics and procedures, Symantec has been able to
better defend customer organizations against this and similar threats. In publishing this new
information, Symantec’s goal remains unchanged: to reassure customers that it is aware of this
threat and actively working to protect them from it.

Protection
Symantec and Norton products have been protecting against Longhorn malware for a number of
years with the following detections:
