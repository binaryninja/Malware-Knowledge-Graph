Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force
Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud
Environments
Executive summary
Since at least mid-2019 through early 2021, Russian General Staff Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS), military unit 26165, used
a Kubernetes® cluster to conduct widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force
access attempts against hundreds of government and private sector targets worldwide.
GTsSS malicious cyber activity has previously been attributed by the private sector
using the names Fancy Bear, APT28, Strontium, and a variety of other identifiers. The
85th GTsSS directed a significant amount of this activity at organizations using Microsoft
Office 365® cloud services; however, they also targeted other service providers and onpremises email servers using a variety of different protocols. These efforts are almost
certainly still ongoing.
This brute force capability allows the 85th GTsSS actors to access protected data,
including email, and identify valid account credentials. Those credentials may then be
used for a variety of purposes, including initial access, persistence, privilege escalation,
and defense evasion. The actors have used identified account credentials in conjunction
with exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, such as exploiting Microsoft Exchange
servers using CVE 2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144, for remote code execution and
further access to target networks. After gaining remote access, many well-known
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are combined to move laterally, evade
defenses, and collect additional information within target networks.
Network managers should adopt and expand usage of multi-factor authentication to
help counter the effectiveness of this capability. Additional mitigations to ensure strong
access controls include time-out and lock-out features, the mandatory use of strong
passwords, implementation of a Zero Trust security model that uses additional attributes
when determining access, and analytics to detect anomalous accesses. Additionally,
organizations can consider denying all inbound activity from known anonymization
services, such as commercial virtual private networks (VPNs) and The Onion Router
(TOR), where such access is not associated with typical use.

Description of targets
This campaign has already targeted hundreds of U.S. and foreign organizations
worldwide, including U.S. government and Department of Defense entities. While the
sum of the targeting is global in nature, the capability has predominantly focused on
entities in the U.S. and Europe. Types of targeted organizations include:

Government and military
organizations[1]

Political consultants and
party organizations[2]

Defense contractors

Energy companies

Logistics companies

Think tanks

Higher education

Law firms

Media companies

institutions

Known TTPs
The actors used a combination of known TTPs in addition to their password spray
operations to exploit target networks, access additional credentials, move laterally, and
collect, stage, and exfiltrate data, as illustrated in the figure below. The actors used a
variety of protocols, including HTTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3, and NTLM. The actors also
utilized different combinations of defense evasion TTPs in an attempt to disguise some
components of their operations; however, many detection opportunities remain viable to
identify the malicious activity.

The following table summarizes the known TTPs used in conjunction with the password
spray capability. As the structure of target networks can vary greatly, the 85th GTsSS
may employ a subset of these TTPs, or other TTPs not included in this summary,
against different victims.

Detection and mitigation
In an attempt to obfuscate its true origin and to provide a degree of anonymity, the
Kubernetes cluster normally routes brute force authentication attempts through TOR
and commercial VPN services, including CactusVPN, IPVanish®, NordVPN®,
ProtonVPN®, Surfshark®, and WorldVPN. Authentication attempts that did not use TOR
or a VPN service were also occasionally delivered directly to targets from nodes in the
Kubernetes cluster.
The scalable nature of the password spray capability means that specific indicators of
compromise (IOC) can be easily altered to bypass IOC-based mitigation. In addition to
blocking activity associated with the specific indicators listed in this Cybersecurity
Advisory, organizations should consider denying all inbound activity from known TOR
nodes and other public VPN services to exchange servers or portals where such access
is not associated with typical use.

IP addresses
Although the exact makeup of the Kubernetes cluster may change over time, a number
of nodes have been identified as responsible for sending and routing the brute force
authentication attempts. At some point between November 2020 and March 2021, the
following IP addresses were identified as corresponding to nodes in the Kubernetes
cluster:

User agents
In cases where HTTP was the underlying protocol used to deliver authentication
requests, the actors used many different User-Agent strings, which are crafted to
appear consistent with those sent by legitimate client software. Some of the User-Agent
strings delivered in the authentication requests are incomplete or truncated versions of
legitimate User-Agent strings, offering the following unique detection opportunities:

General mitigations
As with mitigations for other credential theft techniques, organizations can take the
following measures to ensure strong access control:













Use multi-factor authentication with strong factors and require regular reauthentication[4]. Strong authentication factors are not guessable, so they would
not be guessed during brute force attempts.
Enable time-out and lock-out features whenever password authentication is
needed. Time-out features should increase in duration with additional failed login
attempts. Lock-out features should temporarily disable accounts after many
consecutive failed attempts. This can force slower brute force attempts, making
them infeasible.
Some services can check passwords against common password dictionaries
when users change passwords, denying many poor password choices before
they are set. This makes brute-force password guessing far more difficult.
For protocols that support human interaction, utilize captchas to hinder
automated access attempts.
Change all default credentials and disable protocols that use weak authentication
(e.g., clear-text passwords, or outdated and vulnerable authentication or
encryption protocols) or do not support multi-factor authentication. Always
configure access controls on cloud resources carefully to ensure that only wellmaintained and well-authenticated accounts have access[5].
Employ appropriate network segmentation and restrictions to limit access and
utilize additional attributes (such as device information, environment, access
path) when making access decisions, with the desired state being a Zero Trust
security model[6].
Use automated tools to audit access logs for security concerns and identify
anomalous access requests.
