SolarWinds is urging customers to patch a Serv-U remote code execution
vulnerability exploited in the wild by "a single threat actor" in attacks targeting a limited
number of customers.
"Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds
does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the
vulnerability," the company said in an advisory published on Friday.
"To the best of our understanding, no other SolarWinds products have been affected by this
vulnerability. [..] SolarWinds is unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."

Only impacts servers with SSH enabled

The zero-day vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-35211) impacts Serv-U Managed File
Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP, and it enables remote threat actors to execute arbitrary
code with privileges following successful exploitation.
According to SolarWinds, "if SSH is not enabled in the environment, the vulnerability does
not exist."
The bug found by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Offensive
Security Research teams in the latest Serv-U 15.2.3 HF1 released in May 2021 also affects
all prior versions.
SolarWinds has addressed the security vulnerability reported by Microsoft with the release
of Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2.

The company added that all other SolarWinds and N-able products (including the Orion
Platform and Orion Platform modules) are unaffected by CVE-2021-35211.
"SolarWinds released a hotfix Friday, July 9, 2021, and we recommend all customers
using Serv-U install this fix immediately for the protection of your environment," the USbased software firm warned.
SolarWinds provides additional info on how to find if your environment was
compromised during the attacks Microsoft reported.
Customers can also request more information by opening a customer service ticket with the
subject "Serv-U Assistance."

The SolarWinds Orion supply-chain attack
Last year, SolarWinds disclosed a supply-chain attack coordinated by the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service.
The attackers breached the company's internal systems and trojanized the Orion Software
Platform source code and builds released between March 2020 and June 2020.

The malicious builds were later used to deliver a backdoor tracked as Sunburst to "fewer
than 18,000," but, luckily, the threat actors only picked a substantially lower number of
targets for second-stage exploitation.
Right before the attack was disclosed, SolarWinds' list of 300,000 customers worldwide
[1, 2] included more than 425 US Fortune 500 companies, all top ten US telecom
companies, and a long list of govt agencies, including the US Military, the US Pentagon, the
State Department, NASA, NSA, Postal Service, NOAA, the US Department of Justice, and
the Office of the President of the United States.
Multiple US govt agencies confirmed that they were breached in the SolarWinds supplychain attack, with the list including:
the Department of the Treasury,
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),
the Department of State,
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (part of the U.S. Department of Health),
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
the Department of Energy (DOE),
and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).
In March, SolarWinds reported expenses of $3.5 million from last year's supply-chain
attack, including costs related to remediation and incident investigation.
Even though $3.5 million doesn't seem too much compared to the aftermath of
the SolarWinds supply-chain attack, the incurred expenses reported so far were recorded
only through December 2020, with high extra costs being expected throughout the
subsequent financial periods.
