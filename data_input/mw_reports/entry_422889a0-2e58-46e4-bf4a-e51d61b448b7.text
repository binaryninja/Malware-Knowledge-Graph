Howdy, and welcome to the ThreatConnect Research Roundup, a collection of recent
findings by our Research Team and items from open source publications that have resulted
in Observations of related indicators across ThreatConnect’s CAL™ (Collective Analytics
Layer).

Roundup Highlight: Possible Ryuk Infrastructure

1/4

Screenshot of a “news” site identified in 20201013A: Possible Ryuk Infrastructure,
20201015A: Additional Possible Ryuk Infrastructure
In this Roundup, we highlight Incidents 20201013A: Possible Ryuk Infrastructure and
20201015A: Additional Possible Ryuk Infrastructure.
ThreatConnect Research identified several possible Ryuk domains based on consistencies
with infrastructure identified in Incident 20200930A: Domains Registered Through MonoVM
Used with Cobalt Strike. Those consistencies include naming similarities, registration through
NameCheap, and reuse of the same CIDR blocks for hosting. However, those consistencies
are not unique and most of the identified infrastructure is not hosted on ASNs seen in the
previous infrastructure, SSL certificates have not been created for most of the domains, and
we have no information on Cobalt Strike or Bazar communicating with this infrastructure.
Additionally, one of the domains — service-boostter.com — uses a Let’s Encrypt SSL
certificate, which differs from the previously identified infrastructure. New SSL certificates or
relevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified infrastructure would
help increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk.
The identified infrastructure includes the following:
service-hellper[.]com (45.138.172[.]95)
open1vpn[.]com (45.147.229[.]253)
nasmastrservice[.]com (45.147.230[.]87)
nasmasterservice[.]com (45.147.229[.]128)
nas-helper[.]com (45.147.228[.]164)
elephantdrrive[.]com (45.147.229[.]180)
backupnas1[.]com (45.147.230[.]30)
backupmastter[.]com (45.147.228[.]77)
backup1service[.]com (45.138.172[.]51)
backup1nas[.]com (45.138.172[.]30)
service-boostter[.]com (185.25.51[.]76)
We identified several additional possible Ryuk domains based on consistencies with Incident
20200930A. At least two of the domains were also identified in behavioral information for
Cobalt Strike executables, similar to those in the aforementioned Incident. The domains’
consistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the
same CIDR blocks for hosting. It should be noted that those consistencies are not unique

and most of the identified infrastructure is not hosted on ASNs seen in the previous
infrastructure and SSL certificates have not been created for most of the domains. New SSL
certificates or relevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified
infrastructure would help increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk.
