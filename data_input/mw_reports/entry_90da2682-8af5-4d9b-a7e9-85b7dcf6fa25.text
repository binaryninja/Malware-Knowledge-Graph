In the popular Soviet TV series The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed, a Moscow
Criminal Investigation Department detective infiltrates a criminal group called “Black Cat”.
The image of this elusive and brutal gang, which left their calling card — a picture of a black
cat — on crime scenes, is a composite. After the Second World War, there were several
gangs in Moscow that engaged in robberies and committed murders. Criminals that
remained at large hiding from the police often switched from a disrupted gang to another or
created new groups.

We often see something similar among cyber criminals. Despite numerous arrests of people
involved in ransomware activity as well as the shutdown of some affiliate programs,
ransomware remains threat No. 1. Ransomware attacks continue to be conducted around
the world, with underground forums teeming with posts about selling “access” and hiring
“penetration testers”.
There is no doubt in the security community that the former members of DarkSide,
BlackMatter, and REvil have formed the core of ALPHV, a more mature (due to their
experience) and sophisticated affiliate program. Security researchers unofficially call it
BlackCat for its use of two logos: a black cat and a knife dripping with blood. ALPHV
members later attempted to move away from romanticizing crime by changing the design of
their logo, but the name BlackCat has stuck.
Despite its short history, the group has conducted about 140 attacks worldwide over the
course of six months and has set a new direction for the development of extortion-related
crime. Many affiliate programs, such as Hive, started mimicking and adopting the methods
and approaches of BlackCat. This blog post describes the details of this affiliate program
and analyzes what exactly affiliates do after obtaining access to the networks of their victims.

INTRO from ALPHV
ALPHV started its activity in December 2021, when a campaign to attract new affiliates
started to be advertised on underground forums:

Description of the affiliate program on an underground forum
INTRO
Welcome to our affiliate program.
We’ve taken into account all the advantages and weaknesses of previous affiliate programs
and are proud to present to you ALPHV, a new generation of ransomware.
All the software has been developed from scratch, with decentralization of all web resources
ensured architecturally. A unique onion domain is generated for every new campaign. Every
affiliate has access through a unique onion domain (hello lockbit).
A proprietary data center for storing file leaks bigger than 100 TB.
Top recovery companies, which have worked with darkside, revil, etc. are already
collaborating with us.
Chat support is available 24/7, but you can negotiate yourself if you’d like.
SECURITY
We are fully prepared for present-day conditions, complying with all infrastructure and
affiliate security requirements. Our affiliate program architecturally rules out any connections
with forums(hello revil), has algorithms for data self-deletion after a certain time, and has an
integrated mixer with an actual break in the chain(not to be confused with Wasabi, BitMix,
and others), as you get perfectly clean coins from foreign exchanges. Our backend does not
know the wallets your coins are sent to. The infrastructure is divided into “nodes”, which are
interconnected via an entire network of intermediaries within the onion network and are
located behind NAT+FW.
Even after receiving a full-on cmdshell, the attacker cannot reveal the real IP address of the
server (hello conti)
ACCOUNT
If your account has not been active for two weeks, it will be locked, then deleted. Inorder to
avoid that, we recommend notifying the admins about vacations, breaks, etc.
Rates are dynamic and depend on the size of a single payment for each company, namely:
- Up to $1.5M - 80%
5/18

- Up to $3.0M - 85%
- $3M and more - 90%
In this campaign, potential affiliates were offered a brand new kind of ransomware family
developed “from scratch” in the Rust programming language, which is a popular crossplatform programming language for creating secure and effective applications. The use of
Rust to create ransomware was a major event in the world of cybercrime.

Description of the BlackCat ransomware family
SOFTWARE
The software has been developed from scratch without using any templates or leaked source
codes of other ransomware. You can choose between:
4 encryption modes:
-Full - full file encryption. The most secure and the slowest.
-Fast - encryption of the first N megabytes. Not recommended, the least secure option, but
the fastest.
-DotPattern - encryption of N megabytes with an M interval. May function worse than Fast in
terms of both speed and encryption strength if configured incorrectly.
-Auto. Depending on the file type and size, the locker(both in windows and *nix / esxi)
chooses the most optimal(in terms of the speed / security ratio) strategy for processing files.

6/18

-SmartPattern - encryption of N megabytes with a percentage interval. By default, it encrypts
with 10-megabyte blocks with an interval of 10% of the file starting with the header. The most
optimal mode in terms of the speed\encryption strength ratio.
2 encryption algorithms:|
-ChaCha20
-AES
In auto mode, the software determines the presence of hardware support for AES(present in
all modern processors) and uses it. If there is no AES support, the software encrypts files
using ChaCha20.
The software is cross-platform, i.e., if you mount Windows disks in Linux or vice versa, the
decryptor will be able to decrypt files.
Supported OSs
- The entire Windows line from Windows 7 and above (we tested it on 7, 8.1, 10, 11, 2008r2,
2012, 2016, 2019, 2022 ); XP and 2003 can be encrypted through SMB.
- ESXI (tested on 5.5, 6.5, 7.0.2u)
- Debian (tested on 7, 8, 9)
- Ubuntu (tested on 18.04, 20.04)
- ReadyNAS, Synology
It was clear from the very beginning of the new RaaS program that its creators were not new
to the criminal business and took into account the negative experience of their predecessors,
namely the DarkSide, BlackMatter and REvil affiliate programs. After their notorious attacks
against major companies, these groups came under the spotlight of security researchers and
law enforcers, who, together with samples, obtained access to victims’ personal pages
containing correspondence with threat actors, where they often interfered.

Information about using access tokens
Since binaries have been leaking to analysts lately, and VT premium lets you download
samples and get readmes, random people may appear in chats and disrupt negotiations
(hello darkside), when launching the software you MUST use the flag --access-token.
cmdline arguments are not passed to AVs, which will ensure that your correspondence with
the victim is confidential. For the same reason, every encrypted computer generates a
unique ID used for dividing chats.

7/18

There is a feature for uploading files from the MEGA service, you provide a link to files and
they are automatically uploaded to your servers.
The complete description of all features can be found in the FAQ section.
To avoid previous mistakes, the BlackCat authors fitted ransomware with a mandatory
command line parameter containing an access token, which is provided by the RaaS
owners to their affiliates together with their ransomware suite.
The ransomware uses the access token to calculate determine the access key, which is
added to a Tor link for the victim to access their page.

Contents of the help text file provided to RaaS affiliates
This link is saved in the ransom note, which is created as a text file in each catalog with
encrypted files.

Ransom note
When victims publish information from their chats, BlackCat affiliates punish them by
increasing ransom demands, for example. At the start of their activity, the threat actors were
even more radical; for instance, they deleted the victim’s encryption keys to intimidate future

victims.

Extortion
BlackCat affiliates use the double and triple extortion techniques. Firstly, the stolen
information is published on BlackCat’s dedicated leak site (DLS). Secondly, to mount
pressure on the victim, BlackCat affiliates may threaten to send sensitive data to the victim’s

10/18

competitors, partners, or customers, mass media, law enforcement, etc. Thirdly, the victim
may receive threats of a DDoS attack being launched against their infrastructure.

Chat with a victim
At the time of writing, the stolen documents of 93 affected companies that refused to pay a
ransom were published on BlackCat’s DLS. We estimate that the overall number of BlackCat
victims since December 2021 is about 140.

The tactics, techniques and procedures of BlackCat ransomware
affiliates
To reconstruct the lifecycle of a BlackCat attack, we use the Unified Ransomware Kill Chain
described in Incident Response Techniques for Ransomware Attacks.
Gaining Access to the Network
Since a single affiliate program may involve different threat actors, techniques used for
obtaining initial access may differ. Further, affiliates may use the services of initial access
brokers, who sell access to companies’ compromised infrastructures.
As part of investigating security incidents, we have seen the following techniques:
1
Exploiting public-facing applications.
12/18

This technique gained popularity in 2021 among both affiliates and initial access brokers due
to a lot of vulnerabilities being discovered that allowed arbitrary code execution in a variety of
applications. In the case of BlackCat, the attackers exploited a set of vulnerabilities known as
ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207), which enabled them to
place a web shell on a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server and then conduct postexploitation activities.
2
Using remote access tools.
Access via publicly accessible terminal servers remains the most popular technique for
gaining initial access and BlackCat affiliates used it in some cases. In addition to terminal
servers, access to the target infrastructure could be gained via a VPN; many organizations
still do not use multifactor authentication, which enables ransomware operators to easily use
accounts whose data have been stolen using stealers, for example.
Establishing Foothold
Having obtained initial access, the attackers copy a set of tools (in full or in part) to the
compromised host and seek to ensure persistence and gain access to privileged accounts to
be able to move across the network.
To have additional capabilities to access the compromised network, the attackers could use
tunnels (built using ngrok or gost) or legitimate software (such as TeamViewer or
ScreenConnect).
In some cases, affiliates used Cobalt Strike, a framework that many are already used to
seeing when investigating ransomware attacks.
In most incidents, BlackCat affiliates relied on legitimate tools to extract authentication data
by dumping the LSASS (Local Security Authority Server Service) process. For instance, the
threat actors used ProcDump and exploited the MiniDump feature of the legitimate library
comsvcs.dll.
Sometimes the attackers went beyond LSASS and used various NirSoft tools to extract
authentication data from the registry, web browsers, and other storage spaces.
Network Discovery
Affiliates seldom used innovative methods at the data collection stage, relying on classic
tools. For instance, to scan the network, the attackers used SoftPerfect Network Scanner,
which is another tool many ransomware groups use extensively.
To collect information about Active Directory, the attackers used ADRecon, a tool that is
popular among REvil and BlackMatter affiliates.

13/18

In addition, the NS tool was used to collect data about available local and network drives.
The tool was especially popular with those affiliates that used terminal servers to gain initial
access.
Key Assets Discovery, Network Propagation and Data Exfiltration
With enough privileges in the target IT infrastructure, the attackers start moving to key
nodes, which will enable them to download the most important information and do away with
backups.
To move across the network, affiliates may use both perfectly legitimate techniques (such as
RDP) and noisier ones (e.g., Impacket: wmiexec and smbexec in particular; and Cobalt
Strike).
PuTTY is often used to gain access to the part of the infrastructure running on Linux.
Before being exfiltrated, data is put into archives using 7-Zip, then uploaded to the MEGA
file sharing service using the Rclone utility. In addition, in some cases affiliates used
ExMatter, an exfiltration tool that has earlier been seen in the arsenal of BlackMatter
affiliate program members.
Deployment Preparation
BlackCat ransomware deployment is preceded by the erasure or encryption of available
backup copies and collection of additional credentials that would allow the attackers to infect
the Linux segment, in addition to Windows.
Despite the detectability of BlackCat samples not being high, some affiliates seek to disable
antivirus software before moving on to the deployment stage.
Ransomware Deployment
The propagation of BlackCat in the victim’s IT infrastructure is achieved by either modifying
group policies (which results in a scheduled task being created, on each host, that launches
the malicious file) or using PsExec.
The ransomware is written in Rust. Many researchers rightfully consider BlackCat as one of
the most sophisticated ransomware groups out there at the moment. BlackCat programs are
feature-rich and offer flexible custom settings due to the use of various configuration data
and command line arguments.
There are BlackCat versions for Windows (32bit) and Linux (32bit and 64bit). The 64bit Linux
version primarily targets ESXi servers. In March 2022, a new version of BlackCat emerged,
called ALPHV MORPH. On underground forums its authors proudly claimed that thanks to
obfuscation, antivirus software is practically unable to detect it.

Description of ALPHV MORPHV features on an underground forum
LOCKER
1. We are proud to present ALPHV MORPH. Without going into the spicy details, we inform
that the binary is completely cleared every hour. In addition to recrypting calls, stings, and
other things, the RUST compiler makes it possible to enrich every build with unique runtime
junk, which in the end yielded fantastic results. At the moment, no AV detects it(not to be
confused with edr! we did not test it on sentinel), including defender with the cloud disabled –
the binary is not deleted even after the machine is fully encrypted. In test mode so far,
intentionally(!), it is available to everyone via Build->Obfuscated. In the future, this
functionality will only be available to affiliates with the + status.
2. Minor fixes in the locker’s operation.
p.s. There is no AV for ESXI yet, but we already have a linux polymorph :) That’s right, linux
is also morphed every hour just because we can.
It has been mentioned before that launching BlackCat ransomware requires specifying the
value of an access token in the command line parameter — access-token. In earlier
versions, whether the token value is correct is not checked in any way, while the access key
is calculated using the entered token value; the program will be launched and files will be
encrypted, but accessing the victim’s panel would be impossible. In the ALPHV MORPH
version, the first 16 characters of the access token are used as a key to decrypt configuration
data, which is why if incorrect data is entered, the ransomware will not start.
To bypass User Account Control (UAC), BlackCat escalates privileges using the ICMLuaUtil
COM interface. In addition, privileges can be escalated using the Masquerade PEB method.
BlackCat ransomware may attempt to authenticate using stolen credentials contained in
configuration data.

When launched, BlackCat allows symbolic links from a deleted item to local and remote
items:

15/18

fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1

Stops IIS by executing the following command:
iisreset.exe /stop

Deletes volume shadow copies:
vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet
wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete

Disables recovery in Windows boot menu:
bcdedit /set {default}
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No

Clears Windows event logs:
for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"

In addition, the ransomware ends processes and stops services specified in the
configuration.

It should be noted that BlackCat for Windows can independently propagate itself in the local
area network as a network worm. To do so, the legitimate PsExec utility contained in the
body of the ransomware is used together with stolen credentials specified in the
configuration.
File encryption is multi-threaded. The AES 128 CTR or ChaCha20 algorithm can be used too
encrypt file contents depending on the settings, with nonce vectors containing 8 or 12 null
bytes respectively. In addition, various file encryption modes can be used; below are their
brief descriptions.

16/18

Available command line parameters

BlackCat configuration data is contained in the body of the ransomware in the JSON format.
In earlier BlackCat versions, the configuration data was in plain text, while in the latest
versions (ALPHV MORPH), it is stored in an encrypted form (AES-128 CTR). For decryption,
the first 16 characters of the access token are used as the key. If the characters are entered
incorrectly, the ransomware will not be able to run due to a configuration data error.

Formatted BlackCat configuration data
It must be noted that despite some of the group’s methods being sophisticated, many tactics,
techniques and procedures employed by BlackCat affiliates can be easily detected, which
indicates serious flaws in organizations’ security systems as well as a shortage of skilled

security specialists.
