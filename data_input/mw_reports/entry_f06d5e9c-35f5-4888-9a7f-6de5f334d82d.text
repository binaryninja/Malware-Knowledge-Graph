Executive Summary
Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs detected a new remote access trojan we’re calling ReverseRat.
Based on our global telemetry and analysis, we identified that the actor is targeting
government and energy organizations in the South and Central Asia regions with operational
infrastructure hosted in Pakistan. ReverseRat was deployed in parallel with an open-source
RAT called AllaKore to infect machines and achieve persistence. Given the critical nature of
the sectors the actor is targeting, we advise security practitioners to learn the actor’s current
tactics, tools and procedures to better defend their organizations against potential attacks.

Introduction
1/10

The ReverseRat infection chain is noteworthy because of the steps it takes to avoid
detection and the critical nature of the targeted entities. The evasion techniques include:
Use of compromised domains in the same country as the targeted entity to host their
malicious files
Highly targeted victim selection after the initial compromise
Repurposed open-source code
In-memory component used during initial access
Modification of registry keys to covertly maintain persistence on the target device
Based upon Black Lotus Labs and MalBeacon telemetry, we assess that threat actor is very
likely operating out of Pakistan. We observed a multi-step infection chain that resulted in the
victim downloading two agents; one resided in-memory, while the second was side-loaded,
granting threat actor persistence on the infected workstations. The technique documented in
the image below was active beginning at least in March 2021 and bi-directional
communications with the C2 are, in some instances, still ongoing.

Technical Details
Component 1: Retrieval of ZIP File from the Compromised Domains
In the first phase of the infection depicted in Figure 1, targeted URLs pointing to
compromised websites were delivered to the victim. Black Lotus Labs surmised that the
threat actor chose to use compromised domains in the same country as the targeted
organization to evade detection and blend in with standard web browsing activity on the
target network. While we cannot independently confirm how the URLs were delivered to the
victims, the actor likely sent targeted emails or messages.

When clicked, these links downloaded a .zip file containing a Microsoft shortcut file (.lnk) and
a benign PDF file. If invoked by the user, the shortcut file would display a benign PDF file, as
depicted in Figures 2 and 3. The PDF file acted as a decoy to distract the user while the
shortcut file also surreptitiously retrieved and executed an HTA file (HTML application) from
the same compromised website. In the observed campaigns, the actor-created HTA files
were hosted on the same site as the .zip file, but at different URL paths.
The decoy PDF documents associated with this larger cluster of activity referred to
organizations and events relevant to India in spring 2021. Some of the decoy documents, or
lures, were more generic, making references to obtain COVID-19 vaccines, while others
were more targeted toward, for example, the energy sector.

Component 2: Activating HTA files: CactusTorch and preBotHta
In the next phase of infection, the first HTA file retrieved contained JavaScript code based on
a GitHub project called CactusTorch. This project was designed to inject a 32-bit shellcode
into a running process to help launch a .NET program called preBotHta.pdb, which this actor
has been using since 2019. There were two notable features for this 2021 variant of the
preBotHta file: first, it ran entirely in memory and, second, it contained logic to alter the
3/10

placement of the ReverseRat if the host machine ran a certain anti-virus product. If the
preBotHta file detected a certain AV product, such as Kaspersky, it placed the ReverseRat in
the MyMusic path; otherwise, it placed the file in the Startup folder. When ReverseRat was
saved to the file system in January 2021, it displayed the name tasksmgr.exe; later in year
they renamed it officetool.exe. Both iterations used an internal file description name of
Svchostt.exe.
The ReverseRat
The last action that preBotHta took is to start execution of ReverseRat. The agent began by
enumerating the infected device and obtaining the following components via Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI):
MAC address
Physical memory on the device converted to Mbs
Information about the processor
Max clock speed converted to Ghz
Data width converted to bits
Name (e.g. Intel® Core™ i7-8569U CPU @ 2.80GHz)
Manufacturer (e.g. GenuineIntel)
It also used the .NET framework to obtain the following:
Computer name
Operating system
Public IP address (by checking http://checkip[.]dyndns[.]org/)
The agent then RC4-encrypted this data with a key and sent it to the C2 node. When we
decompiled the .NET code, we found the agent had prebuilt functions to run any of the
following commands based upon receiving the correct parameter.

Based upon other functions, like the one designed to download executables, and other
included functions that covert strings to hex, we suspect that there are subsequent modules
that could provide added capabilities.
We assess ReverseRat was developed in-house, artifacts in the samples revealed PDB
paths that showed the internal name for this project and that a developer for the project used
the screenname Zombie. PDB paths often reference the original path for the source code
files on the actor machine. This file was likely imported and compiled by other members of
the organization, such as the user Neil as indicated in this metadata.
c:\Users\Zombie\Desktop\ReverseRat
client\ReverseRat\ReverseRat\obj\Release\svchostt.pdb
c:\Users\Neil\Desktop\inform\c\ReverseRat\ReverseRat\obj\Debug\ReverseRat.pdb

Notably, the CactusTorch HTA file which dropped ReverseRat included a modification to a
JavaScript function that shut down the infected machine after up to 7.2 million seconds
(2,000 hours). Previous iterations of this script only allowed the computer to sleep for
900,000 seconds (~102 hours). It is unclear what caused the threat actors to change this
time setting.
shell = new ActiveXObject(‘WScript.Shell’);WScript.Sleep(7200000);var exec =
shell.Exec(‘cmd.exe /k shutdown /r /t 0’);exec.StdIn.Close();

Component 3: The AllaKore Component
In the third component, a second HTA file was retrieved from the same compromised domain
that hosted the ZIP and the first HTA file. The second HTA file contained an encoded
command to modify a registry key, the loader and AllaKore. Once decoded, the HTA file
revealed a version of the AllaKore remote agent, potentially to provide an alternative avenue
to maintain access to the compromised network. One rather odd trait of the campaign was
the parallel deployment of ReverseRat with AllaKore.
The actor maintained persistence on the target machine’s current user account after reboot
through modifying the Run registry key to side-load the actor dropped file.
Command modifying the run registry key:REG ADD
“HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” /V “WinLogs” /t REG_SZ /F /D
“C:\ProgramData\WinLogs\credwiz.exe”
The threat actor side-loaded DUser.dll along with the legitimate Windows application
credwiz.exe, a file that is traditionally used for backing up and restoring credentials. DUser.dll
acted as a loader to spawn the CreateProcess function on its file, winidr.exe [note the typo in
the filename], and ran a wait loop until the AllaKore sample was terminated.

Fortunately for defenders, this agent does not appear to come with any encryption, and it can
be detected through network-based monitoring. When we ran the sample in a sandbox, we
observed some of the strings in HTTP communications such as “MAINSOCKET”.

Connections to Prior Reporting and Different Agents

7/10

Once we identified the infection chain detailed above, we correlated this campaign’s TTPs to
a prior campaign from last year called Operation SideCopy. We observed the same infection
process — using shortcut files to retrieve a malicious HTA file on a compromised domain and
then spawn a .NET agent. In this case we also observed overlapping metadata between the
new and old samples. Notably, we even found overlap with TTPs described in a post dating
back to 2019 that described a threat actor side-loading an AllaKore agent with credwiz.exe.
Because this actor has operated for years tailoring open-source frameworks, we observe
nuances in their environments such as the PDB string that linked other customized opensource capabilities including the Bladabindi agent (based on the well-known trojan njRAT).
You can see below the similarity in the two extracted PDB paths below. The top line is the
ReverseRat agent internally called Svchostt, and the second is the njRAT sample internally
called server:
C:\Users\be\AppData\Local\Temporary Projects\svchostt\obj\x86\Release\svchostt.pdb
C:\Users\be\AppData\Local\Temporary Projects\server\obj\x86\Release\server.pdb
While njRAT is a well-known and documented agent, it shows that this threat actor, like many
others, may prefer to use publicly available agents over custom builds.

Black Lotus Labs Telemetry and Analytics
Telemetry – Victim
Once we curated a list of indicators associated with this threat actor, we ran those and other
indictors from previous reporting through our internal databases. Black Lotus Labs’ global
visibility suggests that the campaigns associated with this threat actor were quite targeted. A
small number of entities exhibited bi-directional communications with the identified nodes.
Most of the organizations that exhibited signs of compromise were in India, and a small
number were in Afghanistan. The potentially compromised victims aligned with the
government and power utility verticals. One point we would like to emphasize is that the
agents we discovered were designed for Windows-based machines traditionally found on the
IT network; thus far we have not been able to associate any malware samples with this
activity cluster that were specifically designed to target systems associated with OT systems.
Some of the victims include:
A foreign government organization
A power transmission organization
A power generation and transmission organization
We do not believe that this list entails the totality of their operations, as some potential
victims were associated with dynamic IP addresses, making it difficult to correlate those IP
addresses to a single organization.

Telemetry – Threat Actor
Both Black Lotus Labs and MalBeacon were able to independently conclude the actor’s C2
operations are based out of Pakistan. MalBeacon identified the actor source IP,
103.255.7[.]33, an IP assigned to Pakistani mobile data operator CMPak Limited.
Separately, based on Black Lotus Labs analytics and global visibility, we determined that the
ReverseRat C2 nodes are controlled by at least two Pakistani IPs: 203.175.72[.]105 and
115.186.189[.]6 on port 8088. Notably, 182.188.181[.]224 briefly serves as a backend node
for this operation located at 167.86.97[.]221.
Backends and source range IPs:
203.175.72[.]105
115.186.189[.]6
103.255.7[.]33
182.188.181[.]224
Analytics
Black Lotus Labs identified the following network indicators from files pertaining to this
infection vector:
161.97.142[.]96
164.68.104[.]126
167.86.75[.]119
173.249.40[.]68
144.91.65[.]100
164.68.108[.]22
Based on internal network telemetry analytics, passive DNS records and open-source
malware repositories for related samples, Black Lotus Labs discovered IPs and domains we
can also associate with moderately high confidence to this actor.

Conclusion
9/10

While this threat actor’s targets have thus far remained within the South and Central Asian
regions, they have proven effective at gaining access to networks of interest. Despite
previously relying upon open source frameworks such as AllaKore, the actor was able to
remain effective and expand its capabilities with the development of the Svchostt agent and
other components of the ReverseRat project. We assess that as the actor continues to
develop these capabilities, utilize compromised domains and refine these multi-step infection
processes, it will pose a real threat to organizations in and beyond these regions. While this
actor is not as sophisticated as the most-skilled state-sponsored actors, it should be
continually monitored. Black Lotus Labs is committed to tracking adversary groups such as
this and documenting their tradecraft to proactively help defenders.
In order to combat this particular campaign, Black Lotus Labs null-routed the actor
infrastructure across the Lumen global IP network and notified the affected organizations.
Black Lotus Labs continues to follow this threat group to detect and disrupt similar
compromises, and we encourage other organizations to alert on this and similar campaigns
in their environments.
