CoinMiner Being Distributed to Vulnerable MS-SQL
Servers

The ASEC analysis team is constantly monitoring malware distributed to vulnerable MS-SQL
servers. The previous blogs explained the distribution cases of Cobalt Strike and Remcos
RAT, but the majority of the discovered attacks are CoinMiners.

This blog will explain a specific form of CoinMiner that has been consistently distributed
since last year up until now, which also makes up the majority of attacks. According to
AhnLab’s ASD infrastructure, in systems installed with this specific CoinMiner, detection logs
of Vollgar CoinMiner are also being found. Vollgar is a typical CoinMiner that is installed via
brute force attacks against MS-SQL servers with vulnerable account credentials, and it
appears that the CoinMiner of focus will also use the same method.

Figure 1. Attack flow
The precise attack method and the command that was used cannot be confirmed, but
according to the collected logs of file creation and execution, the attacker first created a
sqlbase folder in MS-SQL data folder (E.g. %ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql
server\mssql13.mssqlserver\mssql\data) and created a malware named SqlBase.exe in the
path. The malware is then created and executed in the path by the sqlservr.exe, which is a
MS-SQL server process.
SqlBase.exe is a downloader malware of a simple form developed with .NET (See figure
below), which downloads settings data and CoinMiner from C&C server and installs them.

The settings data is downloaded from the URL below, but as it is encrypted with Base64 and
AES, it needs to be decrypted.
Settings data download URL: hxxp://dl.love-network[.]cc/config.txt

The decrypted data is in XML format and contains the version information and the argument
that will be used when executing XMRig CoinMiner.

Figure 4. Decrypted settings data
It then downloads XMRig malware packed with VMP in the following URL. The data.mdf file
is a compressed file in the zip format, and it contains XMRig CoinMiner. Sqlbase.exe
decompresses XMRig in the same path under the name of sqlconn.exe.
XMRig download URL: hxxp://dl.love-network[.]cc/data.mdf

Figure 5. Settings data used by the downloader
The compressed data.mdf file disguised by the attacker has the mdf extension, which is a
primary data file used in MS-SQL. Upon looking at the actual MS-SQL data folder
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql13.mssqlserver\mssql\data\, numerous MS-SQL
related data files such as mdf files and ldf (log file) can be seen.

folder
When all the processes above are over, it assigns hidden and system properties to the
XMRig file and executes XMRig along with the user account credentials and URL of the
argument of the settings data obtained above (a.k.a the mining pool) to perform mining in the
infected system.

Typical attacks that target MS-SQL servers include brute force attacks and dictionary attacks
to systems where account credentials are poorly being managed. Although it seems like
these methods make up the majority of the attacks, there can be vulnerability attacks against
systems where their vulnerability has not been patched.
Because of this, administrators should use passwords that are difficult to guess for their
accounts and change them periodically to protect the database server from brute force
attacks and dictionary attacks, and maintain the latest patch to prevent vulnerability attacks.
Administrators should also use security programs such as firewalls for database servers
accessible from outside to restrict access of external attackers.
The following are paths where the SqlBase.exe file, the initial malware installed by the
attacker was created in. These show the MS-SQL systems that were targeted for attack.
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql
server\mssql13.mssqlserver\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql12.sqlexpress\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql10_50.d*****20\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql
server\mssql10_50.d*****016\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql10_50.i***e\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql10_50.i*****20\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles%\microsoft sql server\mssql14.d*****e\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
%ProgramFiles% (x86)\microsoft sql server\mssql10_50.o—
em\mssql\data\sqlbase\sqlbase.exe
MS-SQL is sometimes manually downloaded for a certain purpose, but it can also be
installed by other programs that need a database management system. Upon looking at the
logs above, it appears that other than the paths of normal MS-SQL servers, MS-SQL servers
5/6

that have been installed by ERP and work-purpose solutions were targeted for attack as well.
As MS-SQL installed by other work-purpose programs can be attacked as well as manuallyinstalled MS-SQL, users must pay attention to vulnerability patching and account
management.
