Several waves of a spam-driven malware campaign that began in January leveraged the
name recognition of remote-work collaboration tools like Slack and BaseCamp in links to
malware payloads hosted on the cloud storage those services provide. The emails also
inserted the names of both the recipient and their employer into the messages, in an attempt
to convince their enterprise recipients to download and execute the Trojan payloads
temporarily hosted in those legitimate websites.
The malware, known as BazarLoader, has employed a number of business-centric social
engineering tricks to convince its targets – employees of large organizations – that the
messages contain important information relating to payroll, contracts, invoices, or customer
service inquiries. One spam sample even attempted to disguise itself as a notification that
the employee had been laid off from their job.

When a target was convinced to open the documents tied to the spam email, their computer
quickly became infected with BazarLoader, which itself acts primarily as a delivery
mechanism for other malware. With a focus on targets in large enterprises, BazarLoader
could potentially be used to mount a subsequent ransomware attack.

An example of a BazarCall spam, with no link, attachment, or outward sign of maliciousness
But the threat actors behind this attack, widely suspected to be the same as those behind
malware known as Trickbot, deployed a very different spam campaign beginning in February.
In the newer campaign, referred to as BazarCall, the spam message contained no personal
information of any kind, no link, and no file attachment. In fact, all the message claims is that
a free trial for an online service the recipient purportedly is currently using will expire in the
following day or two, and embeds a telephone number the recipient needs to call in order to
opt-out of an expensive, paid renewal.
In this later form of attack, only people who called the telephone number were given a URL,
and instructed to visit the website where they could unsubscribe from these notifications. The
well-designed and professional looking websites bury an “unsubscribe” button in a page of
frequently asked questions. Clicking that button delivers a malicious Office document (either
a Word doc or an Excel spreadsheet) that, when opened, infects the computer with the same
BazarLoader malware.

To learn this, we did find it necessary to speak to the people on the other end of that phone
number, who (very pleasantly) guide the caller into a malware trap.

The bizarre Bazar email tease
BazarLoader has employed a range of social engineering tropes and gimmicks, and cycled
through a variety of delivery methods over the past several months. The email messages
may have an attached office document, or a link to one hosted elsewhere. Launching the
office document triggers the download of an executable payload, but the email does not
always use that infection vector. Sometimes, the message body contains a link for the target
to download the malware executable itself.

This BazarLoader spam used the recipient’s name, department, and employer in the
headers, body and signature
The messages in the business-focused spam campaign often appear as terse requests to
review a work-related document, and the message content usually contains the name of both
the targeted organization and the recipient – though not always particularly convincingly. In
one such message sent to the employee of a bank, the sender wrote “I am a new employee
in [bank name]. I attempted to contact you 2 times today. I have to ask, what about our client
claim request #[string of numbers]” followed by the words “Online preview in PDF” hotlinked
to the download site.

This

BazarLoader email experimented with a link shortener

The service quickly shut down the malicious link
In another example, the email with a subject line of “I am unable to call you” said in the
message body “Hi, [target’s name]! In addition to our appointment of 1st of february, I
apologize to substantiate that your employment with [name of business] is closed with effect
from [date]/2021. Here is a copy of your Report (preview in PDF). It comes with your
settlement.”
Not everyone received bad news, however. Some targets received messages that claimed
they had received a merit-related bonus or pay increase. “I could not catch you at the
[company name] office. Because Annual Bonus Report No.43-2/5/21 of the head office has
5/19

been processed (preview in PDF). You have additionally credited 1,936 to your payroll
account.”

In the subsequent BazarCall campaign, which began in late February, the messages initially
claimed to originate from a company called Medical Reminder Service, Inc. and include a
telephone number in the message body, as well as a street address for a real office building
located in Los Angeles. The From: address in the messages was forged, but most of the
messages were identifiable by the subject line, which take a form like “Your free period (long
number) has come to end” (sic) or “Thank you for using your free trial (long number).”

The front page of

one of several variations on the “Medical Reminder Service” website, set up by the attackers
to deliver a malicious payload
Recipients of these messages were warned that their credit cards would be charged within a
day or two if they did not unsubscribe from a trial of this service they were purportedly
subscribed to. The only way to find out how to unsubscribe was to call the telephone number
in the message body, which gives the caller a URL they needed to visit. We tried calling
dozens of the numbers embedded in the messages and only rarely were able to connect
successfully and obtain the URL.

The “BookPoint” website and spam variation appeared in mid-April
7/19

By mid-April, the BazarCall messages adopted a new trope, that of a paid online lending
library library of sorts that calls itself BookPoint, BooksPoint, or World Book Point. Like the
Medical Reminder Service messages, the body of these emails have no link or attachment,
but includes a telephone number and a real street address in Los Angeles. The subject lines
also reference a long number or code, which is relevant to the next phase of the attack.

Transitioning from spoofed domains….

…

to domains that reference the spam trope in use by the threat actors.
Perhaps realizing that the faked From address was a dead giveaway, the attackers made
some subtle changes to the book-themed spam. The most important of these is that, instead
of originating from a forged From: address, these messages have a From: address whose
domain is thematically connected to the spam trope.

BazarCall unsubscribe delivers a maldoc
By this point in the attack, recipients of the BazarCall emails have, so far, been coerced to
call a telephone number to obtain a URL where they can “unsubscribe” from the premium
service they’re allegedly about to have to pay for. This is one of the most bizarre parts of the
attack, since it leads to an otherwise legitimate-looking website (created by the threat actors)
that does not make it easy to find how to unsubscribe from the service.
In fact, it takes a bit of hunting around on these websites in order to find the unsubscribe
button or link. Eventually, after a lot of hunting around, we discovered that the unsubscribe
link appears on the “frequently asked questions” (or FAQ) page on the website. There’s

8/19

another link on the “subscribe” page.

This variation on the “medical reminder” website uses the same text in the first FAQ
question…

…

as in the second, and…

9/19

…

also in the third item, but the cancellation “answer” includes an unsubscribe button.
Most of the text on this page appears to come from a boilerplate; all of the answers to
various questions displayed on the pages are identical and completely irrelevant to the
question shown on the page. However, there is always a question that is labeled along the
lines of “how do I unsubscribe from the service” that has a link beneath it.
There may be no magic formula to write perfect ad copy, but it doesn’t require consultation
with a potions master to realize this is bogus.

Call the number, speak to the person on the other end of the phone, and download your
malicious Excel spreadsheet.

10/19

These links then lead to a different page (or sometimes, a completely different website)
where the visitor is asked to enter that long number that was listed in the email’s Subject line
into a text entry box on the website in order to “unsubscribe.” If you successfully put the right
number into this box (and if the stars are correctly aligned in the universe), the page delivers
a malicious Excel or Word document.
After experimenting with calling the call center and speaking with a representative, we
suspect that the web page only delivers a malicious document if the threat actors activate the
“customer number” you provide during the call. If (after finding out the domain used for the
unsubscribe link) we entered a different number from a different message that was part of
the same campaign into the website, it delivered a zero-byte file, or a file filled with garbage
data.
The very helpful person on the other end of the call gently guides you to the section of the
website where you enter your number, and then instructs you to download and open the
malicious Excel spreadsheet or Word document, then to disable anti-scripting security
measures that are enabled by default in most installations of Microsoft Office.
The most jarring aspect of the call was that they were so pleasant about it.

Rapid, low-key infection
In the examples where the malware was hosted on the work-collaboration websites, we most
often saw a link point directly to a digitally signed executable with an Adobe PDF graphic as
its icon. These files’ names were part of the ruse: for example, presentation-document.exe,
preview-document-[number].exe or annualreport.exe.

These executable files, when

run, inject a DLL payload into a legitimate process, such as the Windows command shell,
cmd.exe. The malware, only running in memory, cannot be detected by an endpoint
protection tool’s scans of the filesystem, as it never gets written to the filesystem. The files
themselves don’t even use a legitimate .dll file suffix because Windows doesn’t seem to care
that they have one; The OS runs the files regardless.
The attackers further extended the social engineering aspect of the attack by creating
sacrificial accounts on remote-work collaboration platforms, such as BaseCamp or Slack,
which the attackers used to host (temporarily, until the companies received a report) the
11/19

payload executable. The attackers prominently displayed the URL pointing to one of these
well-known legitimate websites in the body of the document, lending it a veneer of credibility.
The URL might then be further obfuscated through the use of a URL shortening service, to
make it less obvious the link points to a file with an .exe extension.

The spreadsheet’s malicious scripts drop several files into the %PUBLIC% (C:\Users\Public)
folder; Excel runs a command to decode one of them into a DLL and launch it.
In an attack that leveraged a social engineering trope of a magazine subscription invoice, the
attachment was an Excel spreadsheet whose macros triggered PowerShell to retrieve, then
launch, a pair of payload DLLs, each compiled for a specific CPU architecture (32-bit or 64bit) the target’s computer might be using. The payload for the incorrect architecture would
then sacrificially self-delete, leaving only the correct type running.
In the BazarCall campaigns, the attackers deliver weaponized Microsoft Office documents
that invoke commands to drop and execute one or more payload DLLs.

Before you enable active content, the spreadsheet looks like this…

12/19

The infection process runs the DLLs by invoking the rundll32.exe command with an
initialization function. That triggers the system to spawn an instance of a legitimate Windows
component (either cmd.exe, explorer.exe, or svchost.exe) and injects the malware DLL into
that process’ memory space. None of these programs would appear unusual to a casual
observer of the target’s Task Manager window.

After the script runs, it drops this benign spreadsheet in %PUBLIC% to make it appear you
have opened some type of form you need to fill out in order to unsubscribe. By the time you
see this, your computer is already infected.
While early versions of the malware were not obfuscated, more recent samples appear to
encrypt the strings that might reveal the malware’s intended use. BazarLoader appears to be
in an early stage of development and isn’t as sophisticated as more mature families like
Trickbot, but does seem to share some intriguing details in common.

The Mitre ATT&CK framework techniques used by the Excel .xlsb payloads

Bot’s behavior, command and control
The malware itself comes in two flavors: a “loader” (which the attackers use as a malware
delivery mechanism) or a backdoor. We’ve observed the loader version deliver a variety of
payloads the nature of which is beyond the scope of this article.
As mentioned above, BazarLoader’s main loader module persists as a memory-only
malware by running injected into a system process. The malware survives a reboot and
communicates with one or more command-and-control servers over TLS both to the
standard port 443 and, occasionally, to an alternate port, such as 8443.
In an attempt to disguise its function and intent, the malware doesn’t use API system calls
tied to an import table. Instead, every time BazarLoader calls a system API, it resolves the
correct API call address by looking up a DWORD hash in a lookup table. That complexity
confers an advantage to the malware against some behavioral tools, because the malware
generates the hash on the fly the first time it’s run, and there’s no way for any endpoint
protection tools to be able to anticipate what the hash value would be that signifies any given
function.

14/19

If

your computer is set up for use in Russia, BazarLoader self-terminates.
After creating a unique lookup table for the API calls, BazarLoader then checks to see
whether the system is set to the Russian locale in language settings. If the infected system is
configured to use the Russian language, it quits.
The malware initially connects to its C2 server and performs an HTTPS HEAD request to a
specific URL that is known to be not valid: www.microsoft.com/update/service.exe. It
follows that by making an HTTPS GET request to the path /stat/var/upd on one of its C2
servers. The server returns a file that’s larger than 200kb.
Immediately, the bot begins beaconing to its C2 server by making a series of HTTPS GET
requests, followed by HTTPS POST requests, uploading a few bytes of meaningful data.
BazarLoader uses a command and control scheme that looks like the following:
GET https://x.x.x.x/[32-byte-unique-identifier]/[command]/
POST https://x.x.x.x/[32-byte-unique-identifier]/[command]/

The [command] used in these requests is always a number between 1 and 100. Most
commonly, the malware gets into a rhythm where it beacons a check-in request (command
2), then POSTS a few bytes of data (command 3).
GET https://x.x.x.x/[32-byte-unique-identifier]/2/
POST https://x.x.x.x/[32-byte-unique-identifier]/3/

The numbers signify the command being invoked. The /2/ command is a query to the C2 for
new commands, and the /3/ uploads new information to the C2 server.
In addition to these commands, there are a few others:
/1/ triggers the bot to collect a wide range of system profiling information;

15/19

/10/ downloads a payload, given a URL, and executes it by injecting it into
Notepad.exe, Explorer.exe, Svchost.exe, or cmd.exe;
/11/ downloads a DLL and executes it using rundll32;
/12/ downloads and runs a batch script;
/13/ executes a PowerShell script;
/15/ triggers BazarLoader to quit;
/100/ triggers it to delete itself completely, then quit.
We have collected a significant amount of traffic between BazarLoader bots and their C2
servers. The malware communicates with most of its C2 servers directly by contacting the IP
address of the C2, but the TLS certificate on the C2 server seems to be consistently one that
appears to be assigned to a nonexistent domain, amadeamadey.at. At least one IP address
used frequently by BazarLoader is assigned to the internet space used by Amazon Web
Services, giving the malware operators a high-availability C2 from which to operate.

Like the presence of Cobalt Strike, the

presence of BazarLoader can signify the start of a highly dangerous infection, since it can
bring down other payloads. Its method of injecting those payloads into running processes is
implemented in a very similar way to the Trickbot module “injectDLL” as well.

Blockchain DNS usage
The threat actors behind Trickbot have been well known to experiment with a wide variety of
new technologies, adopting short-lived experiments which they sometimes abandon if proven
to be ineffective. For instance, several years back Trickbot experimented with an
16/19

anonymizing tool called i2p, which is (practically speaking) similar in purpose to Tor. This
behavior also characterizes BazarLoader, which appears to be experimenting with a
technology called Blockchain DNS (B-DNS).

Emercoin manages the blockchain that also can be used as a DNS resolver for the .bazar
TLD.
In the course of reverse-engineering the BazarLoader payloads, we often came across
embedded, hardcoded IP addresses as well as domain names that use a non-standard toplevel domain (TLD) of .bazar. As it turns out, domain names that use the .bazar TLD do not
need to be registered in the traditional way that most other domain names do, with the help
of a domain registrar.
A cryptocurrency company called Emercoin permits anyone to assign themselves ownership
of any domain name under the B-DNS TLDs simply by recording its use on a blockchain the
company oversees. The OpenNIC network peers the B-DNS TLDs for Emercoin and other
17/19

organizations, but doesn’t manage them. Once ownership propagates into the blockchain,
the domain is yours.
The decentralized management structure of this arrangement confers certain advantages of
particular interest to criminal groups: Domains registered on the B-DNS system as it exists
today cannot be altered, seized by law enforcement, or revoked or shut down by a domain
registrar or other authority, such as ICANN. Only the person in possession of the domain’s
blockchain private key is able to transfer the registration to someone else (or shut it down),
removing a single point of failure that particularly impacts malware operators.
There are also some weaknesses to the B-DNS system. Unlike the Tor “dark web,” the BDNS system does not provide anonymity to the host IP address that could be used as a
command-and-control server. Also, domains registered under the B-DNS TLDs (which in
addition to .bazar include .coin, .emc, and .lib) will not resolve normally through the
traditional DNS architecture.
Instead, the B-DNS system operators have set up a number of other methods for domain
resolution. One method involves a set of web domains (registered in the conventional way)
that can be used as a sort of B-DNS lookup mechanism . But the malware doesn’t care
about that; Its creators can look up domains in any way they see fit. Emercoin wallets contain
a sort of DNS server that allows users of those wallets to resolve the domains registered in
B-DNS space. There are also browser plugins that will resolve B-DNS domains in the
background as you surf.
The BazarLoader payloads also have a hardcoded C2 server address that the malware
attempts to contact first, but if the bot is unable to reach its main C2, it attempts to resolve
the B-DNS domains using OpenNIC, over UDP. Some BazarLoader payloads also include a
domain generating algorithm, which they may deploy if they can’t reach one of the
hardcoded C2 addresses using either the conventional or B-DNS method.

Connection to Trickbot
It was not obvious at first, but BazarLoader actually shares another similarity with Trickbot:
They use some of the same infrastructure for command and control. I discovered this in a
quite surprising way.
During the course of doing the research for this story, I received an unexpected visit at my
home by an FBI agent. The agent, who said they were in town on other business, dropped
by to perform what they described as a victim notification. They gave me several sheets of
paper containing various characteristics of the malware infection I was studying, including
indicators of compromise; The descriptions and other indicators matched what I was looking
at, but there was one catch.
The agent handed me a piece of paper that said the malware running on my lab network was
“associated with Trickbot actors.”
18/19

It was the first concrete indication I had ever received of a more than coincidental connection
between Trickbot and BazarLoader. From what we could tell, the malware binaries running in
the lab network bear no resemblance to Trickbot. But they did communicate with an IP
address that has been used in common, historically, by both malware families. Of course, a
lot of people have studied this connection in the past. This was not the first time I had heard
it.
But it was the first time, in a long career in cybersecurity, in which for years I have habitually
permitted malware to run for extended periods of time on a lab network based out of my
home, that the FBI had ever decided to drop by, personally, to let me know there was
malware on my network — and even bring me a report with IOCs.
Now that’s what I call service!

Detections

BazarLoader may be detected by the definitions Evade_18a or HPmal/Crushr-BJ, or may
be blocked from operating by behavioral or network protection rules.
Indicators of compromise for BazarLoader have been published to the SophosLabs Github.
