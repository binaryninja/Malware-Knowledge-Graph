Hackers have infected the systems of Altran Technologies with malware that spread
through the company network, affecting operations in some European countries. To protect
client data and their own assets, Altran decided to shut down its network and applications.
The attack occurred on January 24, but the French engineering consultancy released a
public statement only yesterday and kept details to a bare minimum, saying that third-party
technical experts and digital forensics specialists are on the case.
To protect our clients, employees and partners, we immediately shut down our IT network
and all applications. The security of our clients and of data is and will always be our top
priority. We have mobilized leading global third-party technical experts and forensics, and
the investigation we have conducted with them has not identified any stolen data nor
instances of a propagation of the incident to our clients

Altran allegedly hit with new LockerGoga ransomware
Altran made no reference to the type of malware affecting their network, but security
researcher have been following the trail of public breadcrumbs found sufficient evidence to
determine that it's a ransomware attack.
1/8

The first public mention of the cyberattack against Altran came in a tweet on January 25. A
reply from computer security researcher V hinted that behind the incident is a malware
sample uploaded to VirusTotal.

This sample has an initial detection rate of 26 engines out of 69, but the file was quickly
picked up by other antivirus products on VirusTotal and now 43 of them recognize the
malware. The sample was first uploaded to VirusTotal on January 24 from Romania and
later that day it was added from the Netherlands.
If the file uploaded to Google's scanning service is same one that struck Altran's computers,
then it is a ransomware called LockerGoga. This name of the threat comes from the path
used for compiling the source code into an executable discovered by MalwareHunterTeam.
X:\work\Projects\LockerGoga\cl-src-last\cryptopp\src\rijndael_simd.cpp

When BleepingComputer tested the ransomware, we found that it was very slow due to to
how it spawned another process each time it encrypted a file. When discussing this with a
security researcher named Valthek, we were told that the code was sloppy, slow, and made
no effort to evade detection.
According to security research SwitHak, the ransomware will normally target DOC, DOT,
WBK, DOCX, DOTX, DOCB, XLM, XLSX, XLTX, XLSB, XLW, PPT, POT, PPS, PPTX,
POTX, PPSX, SLDX, and PDF files.
However, if launched with the '-w' command line argument, it will target all file types. Other
switches supported are '-k' and '-m' for base 64 encoding and for providing the emails
addresses to show in the ransom note.
In BleepingComputer's test, the ransomware sample launched itself with the -w argument
and also spawned a new process for each file it encrypted. This caused the encryption
process to be very slow.
When encrypting files, the ransomware will append the .locked extension to the processed
files. This means that a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and then renamed to
test.jpg.locked as illustrated in the image below.

Furthermore, reports indicate that the sample may not wipe shadow volume copies, but we
were not able to confirm that.
When done encrypting data on the computer, it will drop a ransom note named READMENOW.txt on the desktop, which includes instructions to contact the
CottleAkela@protonmail.com or QyavauZehyco1994@o2.pl email addresses for payment
instructions.

As you can see, the ransom note suggests that the malware operators target companies
and offer to unlock a few files for free to prove that they have the decryption key.

LockerGoga's ransom note was also seen by security researcher MalwareHunterTeam in
early January, although it included different ProtonMail and O2 addresses.
We first seen this note (name and content), with different email addresses (but still
one ProtonMail & one O2) on 6th evening. From then we seen victims from more than
5 countries. First victim/uploader was from Netherlands...

According to SwitHak's attack scenario, the Romanian local team noticed the threat and
checked it on VirusTotal. The network connection and network shares mounted on
employee systems allowed LockerGoga to spread to offices in other countries, thus
explaining the sample upload from the Netherlands.

Of course, this is all conjecture and there is no hard proof to indicate that this is what
happened.
Another interesting bit of information is that the "Goga" in the ransomware's moniker is a
Romanian family name. This info tidbit coupled with the location it was first uploaded from
could make one wonder if the strain had its origin in Romania.

LockerGoga uses valid certificate
Analysis from Thomas Roccia, reverse engineer at McAfee, shows that the LockerGoga
strain was signed with a valid certificate, which would increase the chances of its
deployment on the victim hosts without raising suspicion in most cases.

However, someone paying attention to the Windows alert asking for authorization of the
certificate would notice that something is not right, because it is for a host process for
Windows Services and the signature is from MIKL Limited.

4/8

The certificate, issued by Comodo Certificate Authority (acquired by Francisco Partners and
known by its new brand name Sectigo) for code signing, has been revoked.
A cursory check reveals that MIKL Limited is an IT consultancy firm incorporated in the UK
on December 17, 2014.
Known file samples for LockerGoga ransomware are 'worker' and 'worker32.' The malware
launches a process with a name similar to what Microsoft uses for its Windows Services,
such as 'svch0st' or 'svchub.'
For those looking to detect it this family of infections using Yara, security researcher V wrote
the first rule that can help organizations protect their systems from getting hit by
LockerGoga ransomware.
We were told at the time of writing, that the global information systems of
Altran Technologies continue to be unavailable. BleepingComputer reached out to the
Paris-based company to provide more information about the nature of the cyberattack that
impacted its operations but has not heard back by publishing time.
