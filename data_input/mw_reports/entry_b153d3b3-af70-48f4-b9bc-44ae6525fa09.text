Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Target
Cleared Defense Contractor Networks to
Obtain Sensitive U.S. Defense Information and
Technology
SUMMARY
From at least January 2020, through February 2022, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security
Agency (NSA), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) have observed regular targeting
of U.S. cleared defense contractors (CDCs) by Russian
state-sponsored cyber actors. The actors have targeted
both large and small CDCs and subcontractors with
varying levels of cybersecurity protocols and resources.
These CDCs support contracts for the U.S. Department
of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community in the
following areas:
•
•
•
•
•

Actions to Help Protect Against
Russian State-Sponsored Malicious
Cyber Activity:
•
•
•
•

Enforce multifactor authentication.
Enforce strong, unique passwords.
Enable M365 Unified Audit Logs.
Implement endpoint detection and
response tools.

Command, control, communications, and combat systems;
Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting;
Weapons and missile development;
Vehicle and aircraft design; and
Software development, data analytics, computers, and logistics.

Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain
access to target networks, including spearphishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray
techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security.
These actors take advantage of simple passwords, unpatched systems, and unsuspecting employees
to gain initial access before moving laterally through the network to establish persistence and
exfiltrate data.
This document was developed by the FBI, NSA, and CISA in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity
missions, including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.
This document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information

In many attempted compromises, these actors have employed similar tactics to gain access to
enterprise and cloud networks, prioritizing their efforts against the widely used Microsoft 365 (M365)
environment. The actors often maintain persistence by using legitimate credentials and a variety of
malware when exfiltrating emails and data.
These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as
well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology. The acquired information provides
significant insight into U.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, vehicle
specifications, and plans for communications infrastructure and information technology. By acquiring
proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their
own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign
policymakers of U.S. intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment. Given the sensitivity of
information widely available on unclassified CDC networks, the FBI, NSA, and CISA anticipate that
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors will continue to target CDCs for U.S. defense information in the
near future. These agencies encourage all CDCs to apply the recommended mitigations in this
advisory, regardless of evidence of compromise.
For additional information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, see CISA's webpage, Russia
Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories.

THREAT DETAILS
Targeted Industries and Assessed Motive
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. CDCs from at least January 2020, through
February 2022. The actors leverage access to CDC networks to obtain sensitive data about U.S.
defense and intelligence programs and capabilities. Compromised entities have included CDCs
supporting the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Space Force, and DoD and Intelligence
programs.
During this two-year period, these actors have maintained persistent access to multiple CDC
networks, in some cases for at least six months. In instances when the actors have successfully
obtained access, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have noted regular and recurring exfiltration of emails and
data. For example, during a compromise in 2021, threat actors exfiltrated hundreds of documents
related to the company’s products, relationships with other countries, and internal personnel and legal
matters.
Through these intrusions, the threat actors have acquired unclassified CDC-proprietary and exportcontrolled information. This theft has granted the actors significant insight into U.S. weapons
platforms development and deployment timelines, plans for communications infrastructure, and
specific technologies employed by the U.S. government and military. Although many contract awards
and descriptions are publicly accessible, program developments and internal company
communications remain sensitive. Unclassified emails among employees or with government
customers often contain proprietary details about technological and scientific research, in addition to
program updates and funding statuses. See figures 1 and 2 for information on targeted customers,
industries, and information.

Threat Actor Activity
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See the ATT&CK for
Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. See the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs) section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

Initial Access
Russian state-sponsored cyber actors use brute force methods, spearphishing, harvested credentials,
and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to CDC networks.
•

Threat actors use brute force techniques [T1110] to identify valid account credentials
[T1589.001] for domain and M365 accounts. After obtaining domain credentials, the actors
use them to gain initial access to the networks. Note: For more information, see joint NSAFBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory: Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to
Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments.

•

Threat actors send spearphishing emails with links to malicious domains [T1566.002] and use
publicly available URL shortening services to mask the link [T1027]. Embedding shortened
URLs instead of actor-controlled malicious domains is an obfuscation technique meant to
bypass virus and spam scanning tools. The technique often promotes a false legitimacy to the
email recipient, increasing the probability of a victim’s clicking on the link.

•

The threat actors use harvested credentials in conjunction with known vulnerabilities—for
example, CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—on public-facing applications [T1078,
T1190], such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to escalate privileges and gain remote code
execution (RCE) on the exposed applications.1 In addition, threat actors have exploited CVE2018-13379 on FortiClient to obtain credentials to access networks.

•

As CDCs find and patch known vulnerabilities on their networks, the actors alter their
tradecraft to seek new means of access. This activity necessitates CDCs maintain constant

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE

FBI | NSA | CISA

vigilance for software vulnerabilities and out-of-date security configurations, especially in
internet-facing systems.
Credential Access
After gaining access to networks, the threat actors map the Active Directory (AD) and connect to
domain controllers, from which they exfiltrate credentials and export copies of the AD database
ntds.dit [T1003.003]. In multiple instances, the threat actors have used Mimikatz to dump admin
credentials from the domain controllers.
Collection
Using compromised M365 credentials, including global admin accounts, the threat actors can gain
access to M365 resources, including SharePoint pages [T1213.002], user profiles, and user emails
[T1114.002].
Command and Control
The threat actors routinely use virtual private servers (VPSs) as an encrypted proxy. The actors use
VPSs, as well as small office and home office (SOHO) devices, as operational nodes to evade
detection [T1090.003].
Persistence
In multiple instances, the threat actors maintained persistent access for at least six months. Although
the actors have used a variety of malware to maintain persistence, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have also
observed intrusions that did not rely on malware or other persistence mechanisms. In these cases, it
is likely the threat actors relied on possession of legitimate credentials for persistence [T1078],
enabling them to pivot to other accounts, as needed, to maintain access to the compromised
environments.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
The following table maps observed Russian state-sponsored cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK for
Enterprise framework. Several of the techniques listed in the table are based on observed procedures
in contextual order. Therefore, some of the tactics and techniques listed in their respective columns
appear more than once. See Appendix A for a functional breakdown of TTPs. Note: For specific
countermeasures related to each ATT&CK technique, see the Enterprise Mitigations section and
MITRE D3FEND™.

DETECTION
The FBI, NSA, and CISA urge all CDCs to investigate suspicious activity in their enterprise and cloud
environments. Note: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint
advisory Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA
and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Detect Unusual Activity
Implement robust log collection and retention. Robust logging is critical for detecting unusual
activity. Without a centralized log collection and monitoring capability, organizations have limited
ability to investigate incidents or detect the threat actor behavior described in this advisory.
Depending on the environment, tools and solutions include:
•

Cloud native solutions, such as cloud-native security incident and event management (SIEM) tools.

•

Third-party tools, such as Sparrow, to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect
unusual activity, service principals, and application activity. Note: For guidance on using these
and other detection tools, refer to CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Detecting Post-Compromise
Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud Environments.

Look for Evidence of Known TTPs
•

Look for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known TTPs
associated with this activity. To detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for
system and application login failures of valid accounts. Look for frequent, failed authentication
attempts across multiple accounts.

•

To detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the steps below:
o

o
o

o

o
o
o

Review logs for suspicious “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing
usernames, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP
addresses do not align to the expected user’s geographic location.
Look for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.
Search for “impossible travel,” which occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP
addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a person could not
realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses in the time
between logins). Note: This detection opportunity can result in false positives if
legitimate users apply VPN solutions before connecting to networks.
Evaluate processes and program execution command-line arguments that may
indicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the ntds.dit file
from a domain controller.
Identify suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying
user account mitigations.
Review logs for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.
Look for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with
normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.

FBI | NSA | CISA

INCIDENT RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION
Organizations with evidence of compromise should assume full identity compromise and initiate a full
identity reset.
•

Reset passwords for all local accounts. These accounts should include Guest,
HelpAssistant, DefaultAccount, System, Administrator, and krbtgt. It is essential to reset the
password for the krbtgt account, as this account is responsible for handling Kerberos ticket
requests as well as encrypting and signing them. Note: Reset the krbtgt account twice and
consecutively with a 10-hour waiting period between resets (i.e., perform the first krbtgt
password reset, wait 10 hours, and then follow with a second krbtgt password reset). The
krbtgt password resets may take a long time to propagate fully on large AD environments.
Refer to Microsoft’s AD Forest Recovery - Resetting the krbtgt password guidance and
automation script for additional information.4,5

•

Reset all domain user, admin, and service account passwords.

Note: For guidance on evicting advanced persistent threat (APT) actors from cloud and enterprise
environments, refer to CISA Analysis Report Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and
Active Directory/Microsoft 365 (M365) Compromise. Although this guidance was drafted for federal agencies
compromised by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) via the SolarWinds Orion supply chain
compromise, the steps provided in the Eviction Phase are applicable for all organizations crafting eviction plans
for suspected APT actors.

MITIGATIONS
The FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage all CDCs, with or without evidence of compromise, to apply the
following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by this threat actor. While these mitigations are
not intended to be all-encompassing, they address common TTPs observed in these intrusions and
will help to mitigate against common malicious activity.

Implement Credential Hardening
Enable Multifactor Authentication
•

Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception. Subsequent
authentication may not require MFA, enabling the possibility to bypass MFA by reusing single
factor authentication assertions (e.g., Kerberos authentication). Reducing the lifetime of
assertions will cause account re-validation of their MFA requirements.6 Service accounts
should not use MFA. Automation and platform features (e.g., Group Managed Service
Accounts, gMSA) can provide automatic and periodic complex password management for
service accounts, reducing the threat surface against single factor authentication assertions.7

Page 8 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A

TLP:WHITE

FBI | NSA | CISA

TLP:WHITE

Enforce Strong, Unique Passwords
•

Require accounts to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be reused
across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have access.

•

Enable password management functions, such as Local Administrator Password Solution
(LAPS), for local administrative accounts. This will reduce the burden of users’ managing
passwords and encourage them to have strong passwords.

Introduce Account Lockout and Time-Based Access Features
•

Implement time-out and lock-out features in response to repeated failed login attempts.

•

Configure time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For
example, the Just-In-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when
needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the
Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to
automatically disable administrator accounts at the AD level when the account is not in
direct need. When the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through
an automated process that enables access to a system but only for a set timeframe to
support task completion.

Reduce Credential Exposure
•

Use virtualization solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are
securely stored, and protect credentials via capabilities, such as Windows Defender
Credential Guard (CredGuard) and Trusted Platform Module (TPM).8 Protecting domain
credentials with CredGuard requires configuration and has limitations in protecting other types
of credentials (e.g., WDigest and local accounts).9,10 CredGuard uses TPMs to protect stored
credentials. TPMs function as a system integrity observer and trust anchor ensuring the
integrity of the boot sequence and mechanisms (e.g., UEFI Secure Boot). Installation of
Windows 11 requires TPM v2.0.11 Disabling WDigest and rolling expiring NTLM secrets in
smartcards will further protect other credentials not protected by CredGuard.12,13

Establish Centralized Log Management
•

Create a centralized log management system. Centralized logging applications allow
network defenders to look for anomalous activity, such as out-of-place communications
between devices or unaccountable login failures, in the network environment.
o
o
o

Forward all logs to a SIEM tool.
Ensure logs are searchable.
Retain critical and historic network activity logs for a minimum of 180 days.

•

If using M365, enable Unified Audit Log (UAL)—M365’s logging capability—which contains
events from Exchange Online, SharePoint online, OneDrive, Azure AD, Microsoft Teams,
PowerBI, and other M365 services.

•

Correlate logs, including M365 logs, from network and host security devices. This
correlation will help with detecting anomalous activity in the network environment and
connecting it with potential anomalous activity in M365.

Page 9 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A

TLP:WHITE

FBI | NSA | CISA

TLP:WHITE
In addition to setting up centralized logging, organizations should:
•

Ensure PowerShell logging is turned on. Threat actors often use PowerShell to hide their
malicious activities.14

•

Update PowerShell instances to version 5.0 or later and uninstall all earlier versions of
PowerShell. Logs from prior versions are either non-existent or do not record enough detail to
aid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities.

•

Confirm PowerShell 5.0 instances have module, script block, and transcription logging
enabled.

•

Monitor remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logs and disable unused remote
access/RDP ports.

Initiate a Software and Patch Management Program
•

Consider using a centralized patch management system. Failure to deploy software
patches in a timely manner makes an organization a target of opportunity, increasing its risk of
compromise. Organizations can ensure timely patching of software vulnerabilities by
implementing an enterprise-wide software and patch management program.15
o

o

•

If an organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released,
prioritize patches for CVEs that are already known to be exploited or that would be
accessible to the largest number of potential adversaries (such as internet-facing
systems).
Subscribe to CISA cybersecurity notifications and advisories to keep up with
known exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. This will assist
organizations in maintaining situational awareness of critical software vulnerabilities
and, if applicable, associated exploitation.

Sign up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce
exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network
presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and
vulnerabilities.

Employ Antivirus Programs
•

Ensure that antivirus applications are installed on all organizations’ computers and are
configured to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the operating system security
baseline.

•

Keep virus definitions up to date.

•

Regularly monitor antivirus scans.

Page 10 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE

FBI | NSA | CISA

Use Endpoint Detection and Response Tools
•

Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. These tools allow a high degree of
visibility into the security status of endpoints and can be an effective defense against threat
actors. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral movement, as they have insight
into common and uncommon network connections for each host.

Maintain Rigorous Configuration Management Programs
•

Audit configuration management programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging
threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses. Having
a robust configuration program hinders sophisticated threat operations by limiting the
effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.16

Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege
•

Apply the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the minimum
permissions they need to do their tasks. This can reduce the impact if an administrator
account is compromised.

•

For M365, assign administrator roles to role-based access control (RBAC) to implement
the principle of least privilege. Given its high level of default privilege, you should only use the
Global Administrator account when absolutely necessary. Using Azure AD’s numerous other
built-in administrator roles instead of the Global Administrator account can limit assigning
unnecessary privileges. Note: Refer to the Microsoft documentation, Azure AD built-in roles,
for more information about Azure AD.

•

Remove privileges not expressly required by an account’s function or role.

•

Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of
administrative tasks.

•

Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users, and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).

•

Reduce the number of domain and enterprise administrator accounts, and remove all
accounts that are unnecessary.

•

Regularly audit administrative user accounts.

•

Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.

•

Institute a group policy that disables remote interactive logins, and use Domain
Protected Users Group.

To assist with identifying suspicious behavior with administrative accounts:
•

Create privileged role tracking.

•

Create a change control process for all privilege escalations and role changes on user
accounts.

Page 11 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A

TLP:WHITE

FBI | NSA | CISA

TLP:WHITE
•

Enable alerts on privilege escalations and role changes.

•

Log privileged user changes in the network environment, and create an alert for unusual
events.

Review Trust Relationships
•

Review existing trust relationships with IT service providers, such as managed service
providers (MSPs) and cloud service providers (CSPs). Threat actors are known to exploit trust
relationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and
data.

•

Remove unnecessary trust relationships.

•

Review contractual relationships with all service providers, and ensure contracts include:
o
o
o
o

Security controls the customer deems appropriate.
Appropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems.
Appropriate monitoring of the service provider’s presence, activities, and connections
to the customer network.
Notification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the
provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks.

Note: Review CISA’s page on APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers and CISA Insights: Mitigations
and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small and Mid-sized Businesses for additional recommendations for
MSP and CSP customers.

Encourage Remote Work Environment Best Practices
With the increase in remote work and use of VPN services due to COVID-19, the FBI, NSA, and CISA
encourage regularly monitoring remote network traffic, along with employing the following best
practices. Note: For additional information, see joint NSA-CISA Cybersecurity Information Sheet:
Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions.
•

Regularly update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices used for remote
work environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.

•

When possible, require MFA on all VPN connections. Physical security tokens are the
most secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator applications. When MFA is unavailable,
mandate that employees engaging in remote work use strong passwords.

•

Monitor network traffic for unapproved and unexpected protocols.

•

Reduce potential attack surfaces by discontinuing unused VPN servers that may be
used as a point of entry by adversaries.

FBI | NSA | CISA

Establish User Awareness Best Practices
Cyber actors frequently use unsophisticated methods to gain initial access, which can often be
mitigated by stronger employee awareness of indicators of malicious activity. The FBI, NSA, and
CISA recommend the following best practices to improve employee operational security when
conducting business:
• Provide end user awareness and training. To help prevent targeted social engineering and
spearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential cyber
threats and how they are delivered. Also, provide users with training on information security
principles and techniques.
•

Inform employees of the risks of social engineering attacks, e.g., risks associated with
posting detailed career information to social or professional networking sites.

•

Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see
suspicious activity or suspect a cyber intrusion to help quickly and efficiently identify
threats and employ mitigation strategies.

Apply Additional Best Practice Mitigations
•

Deny atypical inbound activity from known anonymization services, including
commercial VPN services and The Onion Router (TOR).

•

Impose listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to
execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.

•

Identify and create offline backups for critical assets.

•

Implement network segmentation.

•

network. For example, the adversary may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a
means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion [T1078].18
These specific actors obtained and abused credentials of domain [T1078.002] and cloud accounts
[T1078.004].19 The actors also used external remote services to gain access to systems [T1133].20
The adversary took advantage of weaknesses in internet-facing servers and conducted SQL injection
attacks against organizations' external websites [T1190].21 Finally, they sent spearphishing emails
with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access [T1566.002].22
