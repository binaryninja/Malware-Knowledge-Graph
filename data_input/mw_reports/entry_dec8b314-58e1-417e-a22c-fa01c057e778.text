Speakers: Ashley Shen, Steve Su
This is a threat hunting and campaign tracking 101 workshop Ashley Shen (Google) and Steve
(FireEye) prepared for the HITCON 2020 CTI Village. In this presentation we share the threat
hunting concept with some basic techniques and explain the process and guidance for campaign
tracking. The presentation was only 65 mins so we couldn't covered everything. However
through this talk we hope to share our experience and insight to the beginners.

collects data for the following campaigns. ● Try to catch the attackers before it enter
intrusion stages. Common Techniques ● Bots, crawlers, spiders scrapping ○ e.g. Scraping
email addresses for targeted attack ● Port Scan
26. 26. Hypothesis ● Attackers are doing scrapping on webpage to collects target’s email
address. Investigate ● Identify data sources: ○ Proxy logs ○ IIS logs ○ reCaptcha logs ●
What is abnormal activities ○ known scripting JA3 ngerprints, known bad IPs from
Intelligence ○ Identical outdated User-Agent ○ Traﬃc without referrers ○ Short sessions

IPs with internal intel, some scrapping IPs were used to send phishing emails. ● Attackers
are using reCaptcha farm service to solve reCaptcha. Inform & Enrich ● Leverage phishing
emails sender IPs to detect scraping activities or vice versa. ● Using the collected
reCaptcha farm solving score to improve reCaptcha service and detection. ● Using the JA3
to detect scripting. https://datadome.co/bot-detection/how-to-detect-captcha-farms-andblock-captcha-bots/ https://anti-captcha.com/

emails ● User-Agent ● JA3 SSL Fingerprint. (identify what kind of tools, or custom tools
used by attacker) ● Customized signals
31. 31. HuntingWeaponizationActivities Common Techniques ● Upload malware sample to
public scanning service (e.g. VirusTotal) for testing anti-detection. How to hunt? ● With
known intelligence, writing Yara rule to hunt on scanning service. ● Monitoring
underground with intelligence service. Weaponized

services. ○ 2+ Billion malware samples ○ 1 Million les uploaded per day ● Basic and
advanced research capabilities. ● Crowdsourced verdicts (basic, free). ● Threat hunting,
investigation, relationship analysis (advanced, paid tiers) ● Powerful intelligence tools:
YARA, Hunt, Graph. ● Part of Chronicle, Alphabet’s cybersecurity company.

37. 37. MalwareAnalysis Importantskillforathreathunter! Why doing malware analysis? ●
Understand malware capability to understand the motivation and threat levels. (infostealer?
RAT? miner?). ● Extract IoC (indicator of compromise) to hunt in the network environment,
track the campaign and attribution. ● Identify malware family to understand attacker’s
TTPs. (Is this malware only use by Group A? or shared among diﬀerent groups?) ●
Produce detection rules. To hunt in the network and deploy detection.
