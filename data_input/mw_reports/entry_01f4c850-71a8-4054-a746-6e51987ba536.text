Fake Cisco Job Posting Targets Korean Candidates
blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/fake-korean-job-posting.html

Executive summary
Cisco Talos recently observed a targeted malware campaign being leveraged in an attempt
to compromise specific organizations. The infection vector associated with this campaign
1/11

was a Microsoft Word document that was disguised as a job posting for Cisco Korea, and
leveraged legitimate content available as part of job postings on various websites. EST
Security also described this campaign in a blog post this week. This malicious Office
document appears to have been the initial portion of what was designed to be a multi-stage
infection process.
During our analysis of this campaign, we located additional samples that we believe are
linked to multiple previous campaigns associated with the same threat actor. Each of the
campaigns leveraged malicious documents and initial stage payloads that all featured similar
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Due to the targeted nature of this campaign, the
lack of widespread indicator of compromise data, and the apparent nature of the targeting,
this appears to be associated with a sophisticated attacker. This sort of attack has become
more common as threat actors continue to target users to gain an initial foothold in
environments. Organizations are encouraged to employ a defense-in-depth approach to
security and disallow the execution of macros where possible.

Malicious Office document
The malicious document purports to relate to an employment opportunity with Cisco in Korea
with the name "Job Descriptions.doc." The contents of the document match legitimate job
descriptions that are available online. Below is a screenshot showing the contents of the
decoy document.

The contents of this document appear to be copied from job descriptions that are publicly
available online. Here's an example of these documents:

The file metadata associated with the Word document indicates that it may have been
created in 2018, but was last saved on Jan. 29, 2019.

The Microsoft Word document contains malicious macros that are responsible for extracting
a malicious PE32 executable called "jusched.exe" (the same name than the Java updater
binary) which is dropped into %APPDATA%\Roaming. The macro is obfuscated:

4/11

The encoded string is a PE32 executable encoded with the XOR key: 0xe7. Below is the
decoded value of the variable str(1), which we can identify as a PE header:

The functionality present in the PE32 is described in the next section.

First-stage malware payload

Binary purpose
The PE32 executable attempts to contact the command and control (C2) server over HTTP,
presumably to retrieve additional instructions (script or PE32 executable) for execution on
the infected system.

5/11

Unfortunately, at the time of our analysis, the second-stage payload was no longer available
and the HTTP requests resulted in HTTP 404 messages. The domain contacted is a
legitimate website that had been compromised and was being used to host malicious content
(www[.]secuvision[.]co[.]kr/).

API obfuscation
The attackers hid four specific API calls. The APIs are not listed in the import table, but they
are loaded dynamically using GetProcAddess(). The function names are obfuscated to make
static analysis more difficult. Here's one example:

We can see the library name (kernel32.dll) but not the function name (3ez7/+r7zuzx/fvt7d8=).
The string is decoded by using mathematical byte operations. Below are the decoded APIs:
3ez7/+r7zuzx/fvt7d8= ->
2vvy++r7y+zy3f/99vvb8Ors598= ->
y8zS2vHp8PLx//rK8dj38vvf ->
y8zS0e778M3q7Pv/898= ->

CreateProcessA()
DeleteURLCacheEntryA()
URLDownloadToFileA()
URLOpenStreamA()

The APIs are linked to the process creation, as well as network communications. We assume
the attackers were attempting to hide suspicious APIs from static analysis detection engines
that use the import table. The C2 server is listed in plain text, indicating that this functionality
was not implemented to thwart manual analysis.

Links to previous campaigns
During our analysis of this campaign, we identified several additional samples that we
believe are linked to this campaign.

Case 1
One of these related samples was used in August 2017 and featured the filename "주요 IT
정보보호 및 보안 업체 리스트.zip" ("List of major IT information security and security
companies"). The ZIP archive contains an Office document that features the same macros
as the original sample, but is responsible for dropping a different PE32 executable. The
macros also use the same XOR key as the original sample.

This document describes a list of companies with a summary of their products.
7/11

The macros were responsible for dropping a different PE32 executable, that was also called
"jusched.exe." The API obfuscation algorithm used in this campaign was the same as the
one used in our original sample. Below is a screenshot showing the code execution flow in
both samples. On the left is the sample from August 2017. On the right is the sample from
January 2019.

The C2 server in this campaign was www[.]syadplus[.]com, which is another legitimate
website that was compromised.
The SHA256 of the Office document is:
809b1201b17a77732be3a9f96a25d64c8eb0f7e7a826c6d86bb2b26e12da7b58.
The SHA256 of the PE32 executable is:
adfb60104a6399c0b1a6b4e0544cca34df6ecee5339f08f42b52cdfe51e75dc3.

Case 2
The second campaign we identified was observed in November 2017. In this case, the
filename was "이력서_자기소개서.xls" ("Resume _ self introduction"). Similar to the
previously described campaigns, this document leveraged the same macro execution and
XOR key, but was responsible for dropping another PE32 executable.

8/11

In this campaign, the malicious document was simply an empty resume template.
The C2 server used in this campaign was ilovesvc[.]com, another example of a legitimate
website that had been compromised by the threat actor and used to host malicious content.
The SHA256 of the Office document is:
bf27c1631ef64c1e75676375a85d48f8ae97e1ea9a5f67c2beefc02c609fc18b.
The SHA256 of the PE32 is:
1497ab6ddccf91ef7f2cd75ce020bb3bf39979210351deaa6e0025997ddfda5a.

Conclusion
These campaigns demonstrate the increasingly sophisticated nature of attacks that are being
leveraged by threat actors attempting to compromise organizations around the world. In this
most recent campaign, the attackers took the content of legitimate job postings and used that
in an attempt to add legitimacy to the malicious Office documents being delivered to potential
victims. The use of the same TTPs across multiple campaigns over a long period
demonstrates that this threat actor has been operational for years, and is continuing to
operate to achieve their mission objectives. Cisco Talos continues to monitor the global
threat landscape to ensure that customers remain protected from these as well as additional
attacks that may be observed in the future.

Domains
It is important to note that in all of the campaigns that we observed, the domains being
leveraged by the malware were legitimate websites that had been compromised by the threat
actor for the purposes of hosting malicious content:
www[.]secuvision[.]co[.]kr
ilovesvc[.]com
www[.]syadplus[.]com
Below is a screenshot showing how AMP can protect customers from this threat.
