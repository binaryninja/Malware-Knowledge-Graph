At the end of 2016, there was a major attack against San Francisco’s Municipal
Transportation Agency. The attack was done using Mamba ransomware. This ransomware
uses a legitimate utility called DiskCryptor for full disk encryption. This month, we noted that
the group behind this ransomware has resumed their attacks against corporations.

Attack Vector

3/13

As usual, this group gains access to an organization’s network and uses the psexec utility to
execute the ransomware. Also, it is important to mention that for each machine in the victim’s
network, the threat executor generates a password for the DiskCryptor utility. This password
is passed via command line arguments to the ransomware dropper.

Example of malware execution

Technical Analysis
In a nutshell, the malicious activity can be separated into two stages:
Stage 1 (Preparation):
Create folder “C:\xampp\http“
Drop DiskCryptor components into the folder
Install DiskCryptor driver
Register system service called DefragmentService
Reboot victim machine
Stage 2 (Encryption):
Setup bootloader to MBR and encrypt disk partitions using DiskCryptor software
Clean up
Reboot victim machine
Stage 1 (Preparation)
As the trojan uses the DiskCryptor utility, the first stage deals with installing this tool on a
victim machine. The malicious dropper stores DiskCryptor’s modules in their own resources.

DiskCryptor modules
4/13

Depending on OS information, the malware is able to choose between 32- or 64-bit
DiskCryptor modules. The necessary modules will be dropped into the “C:\xampp\http”
folder.

The malware drops the necessary modules

After that, it launches the dropped DiskCryptor installer.

The call of the DiskCryptor installer

When DiskCryptor is installed, the malware creates a service that has
SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS and SERVICE_AUTO_START parameters.

The creation of the malicious service’s function

The last step of Stage 1 is to reboot the system.

6/13

Force reboot function

Stage 2 (Encryption)
Using the DiskCryptor software, the malware sets up a new bootloader to MBR.

The call for setting up a bootloader to MBR

The bootloader contains the ransom message for the victim.

7/13

Ransomware note

After the bootloader is set, disk partitions would be encrypted using a password, previously
specified as a command line argument for the dropper.

The call tree of encryption processes

When the encryption ends, the system will be rebooted, and a victim will see a ransom note
on the screen.

Ransom notes

8/13

Kaspersky Lab products detect this threat with the help of the System Watcher component
with the following verdict: PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic.

Decryption
Unfortunately, there is no way to decrypt data that has been encrypted using the DiskCryptor
utility because this legitimate utility uses strong encryption algorithms.
