ASEC (AhnLab Security Emergency response Center) has recently discovered the active distribution of the
GlobeImposter ransomware. This attack is being carried out by the threat actors behind MedusaLocker. While
the specific route could not be ascertained, it is assumed that the ransomware is being distributed through
RDP due to the various pieces of evidence gathered from the infection logs.
The threat actor installed various tools alongside GlobeImposter, such as Port Scanner and Mimikatz. Once
installed, if these tools are able to confirm that they are within a company’s internal network, it is assumed that
they will then target that network.

1. Ransomware Installed Using RDP
Threat actors who use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) as an attack vector generally scan for systems where
RDP is active and allows external access. Systems found during this scanning process are subject to brute
force or dictionary attacks. If a user has inappropriate account credentials, then threat actors can easily take
those very credentials.
Threat actors can use the obtained account credentials to log in to the system through RDP, allowing them to
gain control over the system in question and perform a variety of malicious actions. The threat actors who
install GlobeImposter are also assumed to be using RDP as their attack vector. More details about each case
will be covered further in this post, but the bases are as follows.
A. Malware created through the explorer process (explorer.exe)
B. RDP-related settings and logs deleted
C. Connection with the MedusaLocker ransomware threat actor who uses RDP as their attack vector

The threat actor usually creates a folder named “skynet work” in the “Music” folder before installing malware in
this directory. This ransomware attack has been steadily ongoing since last year, and the fact that the same
path is still being used to this day is a characteristic. The following is the log from an attack case by the same
threat actor in the past. Through this, we can see that the explorer process, explorer.exe, is creating the
malware. As this behavior is often seen when malware is installed on systems through RDP, it serves as
reasonable grounds to believe that RDP was used as an attack vector.

Figure 1. Malware installation log
There are also other connections that tie this with the MedusaLocker threat actor. Recently, the United States
Department of Health and Human Services released a report about how the MedusaLocker ransomware threat
actors have been using RPD to infect systems with ransomware. [1] The MedusaLocker threat group has been
using RDP as their attack vector, and relevant information was also released by the United States’
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). [2]
A noteworthy thing to point out is that the email and onion addresses found in the ransom note from the
recently active GlobeImposter ransomware are included in the list of addresses used by the MedusaLocker
group which was released by CISA.

Additionally, the team also discovered during their investigation of multiple logs that some ransomware attack
cases used both GlobeImposter and MedusaLocker. Therefore, it can be inferred that the MedusaLocker group
is using RDP as their main attack vector and are targeting inappropriately managed systems. Adding to this,
they have also been using GlobeImposter instead of MedusaLocker in recent attacks.

2. Malware Used in the Attack Process
As seen in Figure 1, the threat actor installs various pieces of malware in the infected system. Most of the
installed m are scanners and account credential stealing tools. It can be assumed through this that the network
of the infected system can also be targeted.
advanced_port_scanner.exe, advanced_port_scanner_2.5.3869.exe: Port scanners
Files inside the “kamikadze new” folder: Mimikatz
netpass (1).exe: Network password recovery tool made by NirSoft
networkshare_pre2.exe: Shared folder scanner
After the threat actor takes over the system via RDP, the above tools are used to scan the network to check if
the infected system is a part of a specific network. If the system is part of a specific network, then the
ransomware can perform internal reconnaissance and lateral movement in order to also encrypt the other
systems on the network.
The following is a log from AhnLab’s ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) infrastructure of the Mimikatz command
used by a threat actor during their attack. The sekurlsa::logonpasswords command outputs every verifiable
account credential currently stored on the system memory. The account credentials obtained in this domain
environment can be used for lateral movement.

There are some cases where the threat actor would also install an XMRig CoinMiner alongside the
ransomware. This can be seen in Figure 1 as Miners.exe. Thus, not only do the MedusaLocker threat actors
encrypt infected systems using their ransomware, but they also mine for coins by installing XMRig.

3. GlobeImposter
The ols.exe file within the “skynet work” folder is the GlobeImposter ransomware. GlobeImposter is a type of
ransomware that uses the AES symmetric key algorithm for file encryption and a public/private RSA key
algorithm for key encryption. [3]

Table 1. GlobeImposter ransomware overview
Upon execution, GlobeImposter creates a new public and private RSA-1024 key before using the public RSA
key to encrypt the AES key that was used to encrypt files. The generated private RSA key is encrypted with the
threat actor’s public RSA key. This key exists encrypted in binary. As shown in the figure below, the public RSA
key can be decrypted with the hard-coded AES key.

Figure 4. Threat actor’s public RSA key decrypted with the AES algorithm
To maintain persistence, GlobeImposter first copies itself into the %LOCALAPPDATA% path before registering
itself to the RunOnce key, allowing it to operate even after system reboots. A file that uses the SHA256 hash
value of the threat actor’s private key as its name is created in the %PUBLIC% path. The key information is
then encrypted and saved here.
Afterward, files within the system are encrypted. Configuration data such as the list of paths and file extensions
excluded from encryption are encrypted with the AES key. Additionally, the AES key used to decrypt the
configuration data is the SHA256 hash value of the threat actor’s private key mentioned above. The following is
a list of the paths and file extensions excluded from encryption that was obtained during the decryption
process.

When the file encryption is complete, the following batch file is created and executed. The batch file is
responsible for deleting volume shadow copies and logs. Event logs and RDP-related logs are the logs that get
deleted. Like this, the ransomware attack is performed through RDP. It can be assumed that the threat actor
added these kinds of features to the ransomware in order to erase their access history.

The ransom note is created in the folder where the infection occurs under the file name
“how_to_back_files.html”. The ransom note also differs from previously known GlobeImposter ransom notes
but matches the MedusaLocker ransom note that was previously disclosed in the report published by Carbon
Black. [4]

4. Conclusion
Threat actors have consistently been using RDP during their initial infiltration and lateral movement processes.
These attacks usually occur through brute force and dictionary attacks against systems with inappropriate
account credentials. In particular, a large number of ransomware threat actors aside from the MedusaLocker
group also use RDP as their main initial attack vector.
Users can deactivate RDP when not in use to decrease the number of attack attempts. If RDP is being used, it
is advised to use a complex account password and to change it periodically to prevent brute force and
dictionary attacks. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.
