Introduction

Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, many observers expected that a Russian-led
hybrid war, like that observed when Russia invaded Donbas and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, would involve
marrying cyber weapons, influence operations, and military force to swiftly overrun Ukrainian defenses. Now, one
year after its full-scale invasion, Russia’s military has indeed wrought physical devastation in Ukraine but has not
achieved its objectives—in part because Moscow’s parallel cyber and influence operations have largely failed.
Russian destructive cyberattacks have fluctuated in
intensity and been frequently repelled. Most Kremlinbacked propaganda campaigns aimed at Ukraine
have had little impact, revealing the limitations of
Russian influence when met by a resilient Ukrainian
population. Russian state-affiliated cyber and
influence actors, however, have not been deterred
and continue to seek alternative strategies inside and
outside Ukraine.

Our analysis best fits into
three periods of the war:
Phase 1 - January 2022 to Late March 2022
Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine
Phase 2 - Late March 2022 to September 2022
Russia’s withdrawal from advance toward Kyiv to focus
on the Donbas
Phase 3 - September 2022 to Present
Russia's reaction to Ukraine’s counteroffensives in eastern
and southern Ukraine to the present day.
We hope to provide some lessons learned from Russian state
operations and Ukraine’s resilience—lessons that can inform
a broader playbook for defending against authoritarian
aggression in the digital space.

Russia's full-scale military invasion

Destructive attacks observed since January

January 2022 – Late March 2022

In January 2022, Russian military actor DEV-0586
deployed the WhisperGate wiper against a few
Ukrainian organizations.5 Since that time, Russian
threat actors have employed at least nine new wiper
families and two types of ransomware against more
than 100 Ukrainian organizations. Hundreds of
systems across the Ukrainian government, critical
infrastructure, media, and commercial sectors have
been affected by wipers that permanently delete
files and/or render machines inoperable, but most of
these attacks coincided with Russia’s initial invasion in
February and March 2022.

Threat actors aligned with the Russian GRU—
most prominently IRIDIUM—have not returned to
the large-scale deployment of destructive wipers
observed in the first 30 days of the war. Active
incident response and information sharing between
Ukrainian and allied network defenders has almost
certainly disrupted destructive efforts and may be
pressing threat actors to develop and deploy new and
diverse malware families. The peaks and valleys of
deployment and periodic introduction of new wipers
or variants suggest continued reactive development
of destructive capability rather than a deep reservoir
of destructive tools.

# of attacks

Russian cyber threat and influence actors focused
much of their operational capacity on achieving an
early victory in Ukraine, consistent with the value that
Russian military thought places on high impact at
the start of a war.4 Perhaps anticipating a quick and
decisive victory, early Russian cyberattacks did not
appear to account for the rapid response by Ukrainian
network defenders and the international technology
community to identify and mitigate malicious activity.

Russian influence actors attempted to flood social

of the full-scale invasion. Russian state-affiliated
messengers attempted to dehumanize Ukrainians by
calling for the “denazification” of the country and shift
blame to the US, alleging American biolaboratories
were creating bioweapons in Ukraine.6,7
Simultaneously, the Kremlin attempted false flag

Russia's propaganda
ecosystem targeting Ukraine
Russia's propaganda ecosystem is comprised of legacy and
post-invasion propaganda elements that have waxed and
waned in prominence over the course of the war. The legacy
ecosystem has four main categories: 1) the Kremlin’s so-called
“fifth column” in Ukraine, 2) media of the self-declared Donetsk
People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR),
3) Russian intelligence-linked media, and 4) influencers and
war correspondents, mostly in Eastern Ukraine. Post-invasion,
“localized” news sites, newly launched media outlets, and
organized groups—some affiliated with prominent agents-ofinfluence—push Kremlin-aligned narratives.

Prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion, Ukraine’s media
environment had long been heavily influenced by
major pro-Russian Ukrainian figures commonly
referred to as the Kremlin’s “fifth column.”
These media figures and moguls, such as Viktor
Medvedchuk and Yevhen Muraev, who collectively
owned four of the largest Ukrainian channels, all with
strong pro-Russian bias, played major roles in Russian
influence operations in the lead-up to the invasion. In
addition to spreading pro-Russian propaganda across
the airwaves, the Kremlin planned to install Muraev at
the head of a pro-Russian government, according to
British intelligence.10
The self-declared Donestk People's Republic (DNR)
and Luhantsk People's Republic (LNR) also used
their centralized information environments—with
many prominent media networks controlled by the
DNR’s Ministry of Information and LNR’s Ministry of
Communications—to spread Russian war propaganda
ahead of and during the invasion. Officials of the
unrecognized republics often acted as primary
sources for the most egregious propaganda, a trend
that continues today.
Many of the most prolific propaganda efforts in
Ukraine, dating back to Russia’s 2014 invasion, have
been backed by Russia’s Federal Security Service
(FSB)—such as NewsFront—or allegedly seed-funded
by Kremlin presidential grants, like PolitNavigator.11,12
In 2022, these outlets remained among the most
virulently anti-Ukrainian in their content. Separately,
Ukrainе’s Security Service, the SBU, has outed

numerous anonymous, ostensibly local news-focused
Telegram accounts as managed by Russia’s GRU.
These channels aim to influence Ukrainian audiences
in cities Russia saw as critical in its attempts to
capture the country at the start of the war.13
Finally, dozens of pro-Russia social media influencers
and war correspondents attempted to shape the
perception of events on the ground, particularly in
Donbas. These war correspondents form their own
media brands while still contributing to Russian stateaffiliated media. Figures like Semyon Pegov (known as
“WarGonzo”),14 Evgeniy Poddubny,15 and Sasha Kots16
are among the most prominent such correspondents,
all of whom contribute to state media and have been
awarded medals by the Kremlin for “courageous” and
“professional” coverage.17,18,19
Russia’s influence efforts in the weeks leading up to
the invasion and the early days of the war largely
fell flat among Ukrainian and western audiences,
upended by the proactive release of intelligence.20
Additional challenges limited the Kremlin’s impact
once tanks rolled across the border and complicated
Russia’s ability to reach western audiences online, with
technology and social media companies removing
many Kremlin-affiliated accounts.21,22,23 RT America—
which had offices in New York, Miami, Los Angeles,
and Washington, DC—shut down.24 Research groups
and media outlets debunked narratives attempting
to blame Ukraine for Russian attacks, like the hospital
bombing in Mariupol and the massacre in Bucha in
March 2022.25,26

In our June 2022 report
“Defending Ukraine: Early
Lessons from the Cyber War,”
we introduced the Russian
Propaganda Index (RPI), a
metric that measures the
flow of traffic to sites known
to promote pro-Kremlin
narratives as a proportion of
overall internet traffic.

7

In that report, we illustrated how Russian
propaganda consumption in Ukraine spiked at the
onset of the war as Russian influence operations
mirrored Russia’s full-scale invasion on the
ground. RPI trends since the invasion illustrate
the efficacy of efforts to combat the spread of
Russian propaganda within Ukraine. By June 2022,
RPI levels had returned to levels close to pre-war
averages.
Within Russia, the Kremlin’s robust domestic
propaganda system largely maintained its grip,
in no small part due to its wave of “fake news”
laws.27 However, small but significant acts of
protest indicated some at home did not
condone the horrors of the invasion.28

Phase 2: Cyber and influence focus turns to
undermining Kyiv's foreign and domestic support

Late March 2022 – September 2022
From late March to April 2022, Russian forces
withdrew from their axes of advance toward
Kyiv from the north and east to focus on
Donbas and other then-occupied regions.29
At this time, Microsoft observed a cyber and
influence operational pivot to target material and
political support to Ukraine. Microsoft telemetry
showed Russian threat actors directing their
destructive cyberattacks toward the logistics
and transportation sector inside Ukraine
possibly to disrupt weapons or humanitarian
flow to the frontlines. As reported in June,
Microsoft observed GRU-affiliated threat actor
IRIDIUM launch destructive wiper attacks and
intelligence collection intrusions against Ukraine’s
transportation sector in the spring.30 Russian
forces launched numerous missile strikes against
Ukrainian transportation infrastructure during this
same time, suggesting a disruption of the flow of
goods and people across Ukraine as a common
objective.31
Cyber threat actors also conduced robust
cyberespionage operations against organizations
providing military or humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine. ACTINIUM, also known as Gamaredon,
conducted multiple phishing campaigns targeting
humanitarian aid and resettlement organizations
active in Ukraine, and entities involved in war
crimes investigations from April through June

access to networks of entities sympathetic
to Ukraine by sending phishing emails
masquerading as Ukrainian military officials
asking for additional humanitarian and military
assistance. From late May to June, the group
sent targeted phishing emails to multiple relief
organizations based in Ukraine and the Baltics,
as well as intergovernmental agencies assisting
victims of war and documenting war crimes.

Ukraine.33

Moscow also remobilized its propaganda efforts
to target populations within occupied Ukrainian
territory and abroad, pivoting to focus on fighting
that hit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in
southern Ukraine, with Russia’s propagandists
fearmongering about nuclear attacks.34 Aiming to
garner Kremlin-aligned coverage in international
press, the Russian government sponsored a PR

authorities even appeared to take control of much

Phase 3: Russia pairs kinetic operations with
doubled-down cyber and influence operations
September 2022 – Present
Following Ukraine’s successful southern and
northeastern counteroffensive from late August
through September, the Russian government
deepened its claims to Ukrainian territory and
intensified military operations designed to break the
will of the Ukrainian people.37 Moscow announced
a partial military mobilization in late September and
illegally annexed Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia,
and Kherson regions of Ukraine by early October.38
Almost immediately after claiming sovereignty over
eastern Ukrainian territory, the Russian military
launched a barrage of missile strikes on critical
energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine’s major
cities, cutting heat and power to civilians in the
impacted areas as winter set in. In December, Russian
President Vladimir Putin disregarded international
criticism of the missile strike, claiming attacks on
energy infrastructure would continue.39

Outside of Ukraine, IRIDIUM escalated operations to
disrupt supply chains to Ukraine while other GRUlinked groups targeted Western defense-related
organizations, likely for intelligence collection.
MSTIC uncovered and made public the assessment
that IRIDIUM expanded destructive attacks with
the Prestige ransomware operation against the
transportation sector in Poland, a NATO member and
key logistical hub for Ukraine-bound supplies.41 As
of October, another GRU-linked group, STRONTIUM,
had potentially compromised a separate Polish
transportation sector firm, and later increased
reconnaissance against NATO-affiliated organizations,
suggesting an intent to conduct future intrusions
against this target set.

Army), Molodaya Gvardia (Youth Guard of United
Russia), and YugMolodoy (Youth South).42 Agentsof-influence have also spun up crowdfunding efforts
to support Russia’s war effort from back home.
One such example is through “Readovka Helps,”
an organization affiliated with pro-Russian outlet
Readovka and led by Alexander Ionov, who was
indicted by the US Justice Department for working in
conjunction with the FSB and “orchestrating a yearslong foreign malign influence campaign.”43 Despite
purporting to maintain a humanitarian mission,
Readovka Helps has crowdfunded supplies for
Russian soldiers.
Online, websites presenting as Ukrainian local news
outlets pull content from Russian state-affiliated
sources and prominently display Russia’s “ZOV”
war symbols in their digital brands. These sites and
channels’ operations ebb and flow: While some of the
sites have gone dormant, particularly those tailored
to Ukrainian cities Russia failed to occupy, others have
persisted, laundering overt Russian media and proKremlin messages.44 Pro-Russian social media groups
like the “Digital Army of Russia,”45 created in January
2023, use brigading tactics—or the coordinated attack
by a group of users—to spam Ukrainian social media
communities online with Russian war propaganda.46

Since mid-January this year, destructive actor IRIDIUM
has conducted actions that could be in preparation
for a renewed offensive: conducting reconnaissance,
initial access operations, and wiper deployments
against targets within Ukraine that are reminiscent of
the early days of the invasion. Between January 12-28,
2023, IRIDIUM launched several phishing campaigns
to gain access to accounts at defense industrial base
and energy sector organizations in Ukraine. During
this same period, the threat actor deployed a new
variant of Caddywiper malware against a major
Ukrainian media outlet. Of note, Ukrainian media was
an early target of IRIDIUM’s DesertBlade wiper. By late
January, a suspected Russian threat actor deployed a
new wiper MSTIC calls LeopardBlade against systems
associated with a regional government organization
in northern Ukraine. Cybersecurity firm ESET also
spotted the attack and has attributed it to a group
most equivalent to IRIDIUM.47 MSTIC's independent
attribution investigation is ongoing. An energy
provider in this same region was a pre-invasion victim
in early February 2022.

Within the 74 countries targeted by Russian threat actors between February 23, 2022 and February 7 of this year, Russian threat actors were most interested
in government and IT sector organizations, just as they were in Ukraine. Several actors compromise IT firms to exploit trusted technical relationships and gain
access to those firms’ clients in government, policy, and other sensitive organizations.

SVR have targeted and potentially gained footholds
in government, policy, or critical infrastructure sectors
throughout the Americas, Europe, and elsewhere.
Although most of the operations are probably
espionage-focused, the GRU actors have already
shown a willingness to use destructive tools outside

# of observed events

Cyberespionage operations against Ukraine’s allies
that pre-date and have persisted throughout the
war are likely to intensify and focus on diplomatic
and military-related organizations in NATO member
states, Ukraine’s neighbors, and against private
sector firms directly or indirectly involved in Ukraine’s
military supply chain. For the past year, threat actors

Excluding Ukraine, Microsoft has observed Russian nation state threat activity against organizations
based in 74 countries, between February 23, 2022 and February 7 of this year. EU and NATO
member states, especially on the eastern flank, dominate the top 10 most targeted countries
by number of threat events recorded. However, Russian threat actors conducted activities
that ranged from reconnaissance to data exfiltration in organizations across the globe,
in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

A quickly evolving digital landscape lends itself to
renewed momentum for Russian information warfare
as well. Despite limited success over the course of the
war’s first year, Russia’s propaganda efforts will likely
surge if the rumored military offensive in the spring
of 2023 commences.48

Trends in cyber threats since
Russia's invasion

Russian cyber actors have time
and again been stymied by
a hypervigilant and engaged
community of cybersecurity
professionals within Ukraine
and worldwide. As noted earlier,
this community of defenders
has likely blunted the impact of
Russian state-affiliated network
operations but has not stopped
Moscow’s efforts to gain access
to and conduct attacks on
desired targets.

Microsoft Threat

Aside from the numerous destructive wiper
attacks, Microsoft has observed three trends
in Russian threat activity emerge as the war
progresses that are likely to shape Russian cyber
operations going forward:

1

Using ransomware as deniable destructive weapon

2

Gaining initial access through diverse means

3

Integration of real and pseudo hacktivists for power projection

In the following section we describe how each
of these serve to complicate attribution, evade
defenses, improve network persistence, or
amplify effects of influence operations.

Using ransomware as
deniable destructive weapon
IRIDIUM’s development and deployment of
Prestige ransomware against Ukrainian and Polish
transportation sector organizations in October may
have been a trial balloon, testing the international
community’s ability to attribute espionage operations
to Moscow or testing the reaction of Ukraine’s allies
to a targeted destructive attack outside Ukraine.
Since then, an actor that another cybersecurity firm
suggests is likely to be IRIDIUM, deployed a new
“Sullivan” ransomware (RansomBoggs).49
MSTIC observed at least three variants of this
ransomware deployed against one Ukrainian
organization over the course of three to four days,
reflecting iterative development and refinement
for modular functionality and improved detection
evasion. As of December, MSTIC had only observed
Sullivan at two Ukrainian organizations with no
obvious military or political significance. IRIDIUM’s
use of ransomware in Poland and the testing and
refinement of Sullivan on networks that seem more
like cyber test ranges than actual targets suggest the
actor is preparing Sullivan, or related malware, for
use outside of Ukraine.
49. https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/11/28/ransomboggs-new-ransomware-ukraine/

MSTIC observed that between November 21 and 25, suspected Russian threat actors deployed at least three variants of the Sullivan ransomware, as well as two
variants of the wrapper code, engineered to tamper with anti-malware products and make Sullivan more difficult to detect. The multiple files pictured above include
the variants as well as additional files with names that suggest some relation to Sullivan, but whose functionality MSTIC could not determine. Overall, the actor made
rapid adaptations over eight distinct attempts to evade detections and mitigations and destroy network systems over this four-day period.

Gaining initial access
through diverse means

Use of hacktivists for
power projection

Throughout the conflict, Russian threat actors
have gained initial access to their targets within
and outside of Ukraine using a diverse toolkit. On
a technical level, common tactics and techniques
have included the exploitation of internet-facing
applications, backdoored pirated software, and
ubiquitous spearphishing. IRIDIUM has backdoored
pirated versions of Microsoft Office to gain access
to targeted organizations in Ukraine. Microsoft also
assesses that the actor is responsible for uploading
a weaponized version of Windows 10 to Ukrainian
forums, exploiting demand for low-cost versions of
the software to gain access to government and other
sensitive organizations in Ukraine.
Just before and early in the war, Microsoft observed
that DEV-0586 exploited Confluence servers to gain
access to Ukrainian organizations later impacted by
Whispergate wiper malware or other operations.
STRONTIUM has used public exploits to compromise
on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers and abuse
Exchange Online to gain access to government
and transportation sector organizations in Central
Europe, among other targets. In late 2022, IRIDIUM
sent spearphishing emails to dozens of organizations
in Ukraine, as well as Romania, Lithuania, Italy, the

United Kingdom, and Brazil, which included malicious
payloads targeting CVE-2022-41352 in on-premises
Zimbra servers. The targeted sectors included, among
others, IT, energy, disaster response, finance, media,
and refugee assistance.
Russian threat actors are also actively abusing
technical trust relationships, targeting IT providers
to reach more sensitive targets downstream without
immediately triggering alerts. STRONTIUM and
KRYPTON both attempted to access an IT provider
in Poland that counts sensitive sectors among its
client base. NOBELIUM, the same actor behind
the SolarWinds intrusion, regularly attempts to
compromise diplomatic organizations worldwide
and foreign policy think tanks by first compromising
cloud solutions and managed services providers that
serve those organizations, a trend Microsoft first
highlighted in 2021.50

An evolving landscape of real or pseudo hacktivist
groups have played active roles in expanding the
reach of Moscow’s cyber presence since the outset of
the war. Overall, these groups have served to amplify
Moscow’s displeasure with adversaries and exaggerate
the number of pro-Russian cyber forces.
Microsoft and others in the US cybersecurity
community have uncovered artifacts to indicate links
between Russian military intelligence threat actors
and hacktivist influence campaigns on Telegram.51
In January 2023, DTAC observed overlap between
IRIDIUM and pro-Russian hacktivist Telegram
channel Cyber Army of Russia, which claims to be
a grassroots movement of patriotic Russians. On
January 17, IRIDIUM used a modified CaddyWiper
payload in a destructive attack against a Ukrainian
media organization that CERT-UA identified as
Ukrinform.52 The same day, Cyber Army of Russia
claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting it was
a response to the outlet’s war reporting. The link
between the IRIDIUM wiper attack and Cyber Army
of Russia social media posts suggests coordination
between the two entities but the exact nature of the
relationship remains unclear.

Trends in influence operations since Russia's invasion

Several additional trends have emerged in Russian influence operations as the war has progressed.
Links between cyber actors and hacktivist groups in the information space represent one of the novel
influence tactics used by Russia since the start of the war.

First,

Second,

Third,

Finally,

Russian influence actors seek to
weaponize fact-checking to spread
Kremlin-aligned narratives.

pro-Russian actors online consistently
spread purportedly leaked information to
target political figures and governments
supportive of Kyiv.

Russian government and affiliated entities
regularly coordinate foreign press tours
throughout occupied Ukraine to garner
international media coverage from
sympathetic voices and achieve wider
messaging goals.

in addition to operations targeting
Moldova, Russia continues to
conduct multi-faceted influence
operations in Ukraine’s periphery
and across Europe to widen societal
divisions, discredit leadership
supportive of Ukraine, and promote
pro-Russian networks in those
countries.

Playing off information integrity efforts that
emerged following the Kremlin’s interference
in the 2016 US presidential election, Russian
messengers manipulate the language and
credibility of fact-checking to spread false
claims. Social media accounts purporting to
be fact-checking entities, like the Telegram
channel War on Fakes,53 spread claims of
“Ukrainian fakes” and “debunked” reports
of Russian attacks on civilian and critical
infrastructure.

Russia’s use of allegedly leaked materials—such
as sensitive documents or communications—to
wield influence is not a new tactic.54 However, the
regularity with which allegedly leaked materials
have been promoted on pro-Russian social media
channels throughout the war highlights the
importance of hack-and-leak operations for the
Kremlin. Leaks are often difficult to authenticate,
making them an effective tool to amplify existing
divisions and tensions by allegedly exposing
sensitive information.

These tours often result in favorable coverage of
Russia’s war by the visiting reporters in their respective
media outlets and websites, acting as a pathway for
pro-Russian propaganda to reach audiences otherwise
unlikely to engage with Russian media. Ostensibly
independent reporters who publish content aligned
with Kremlin propaganda narratives are frequently
given honors by the government, including the
Russian agency Rossotrudnichestvo’s recent “Honest
View” media awards.55

Alongside Russia’s destructive cyberattacks
reaching into Poland, influence operations—at times
supported by influence actors in Belarus—target
Polish political bodies and everyday citizens alike with
propaganda on energy and western militarism. The
Kremlin continues to dedicate particular attention
in Poland to stoking ethnic conflict between Poles
and Ukrainians, attempting to foment nationalistic
intolerance in Polish far-right circles. Political
initiatives such as “Stop the Ukrainization of Poland”56
and on-the-ground demonstrations such as those
sponsored by “This Is Not Our War”57 are promoted,
amplified, and supported by Russian influence
actors. Meanwhile, a recent campaign targeting the
Ukrainian diaspora primarily in Poland and the Baltic
states has been promoting fake or manipulated
government documents indicating that Ukrainian
men of military age will be forcibly conscripted to
fight in Ukraine.58
Bulgaria, despite its own historical vulnerabilities to
Russian influence operations, has emerged as a key
partner to Ukraine in the face of Russia’s full-scale
invasion.59,60 Bulgarian political leaders supplied
military aid to Ukraine, despite the Kremlin’s efforts
to infiltrate Bulgarian politics through its diplomatic
presence.61 Bulgaria’s support to Ukraine earned
the ire of the Kremlin—cyberattacks blamed on

Russian actors have targeted government websites
while Gazprom, Russia’s gas monopoly, chose to cut
exports to Bulgaria and Poland early in the war.62,63
Russian digital influence operations targeting Bulgaria
leverage pro-Russian social media communities to
direct local audiences to sites known to promote proKremlin narratives. Russian propaganda consumption
in Bulgaria spiked at the time of the invasion of
Ukraine and has remained elevated, with current
levels of consumption roughly 65% higher than prewar averages.
In Sweden, a provocation in late January in which a
far-right political figure burned a Quran outside of
the Turkish embassy in Stockholm sparked a strong
response from Turkey, including statements from
the Turkish government indicating Turkey would
consider blocking Swedish accession into NATO.64
While at the time of this writing it remains unknown
if Russian actors contributed to the coordination of
the provocation, the alleged organizers and sponsors
of the provocation have ties to Russian state media
and influence networks.65 The incident highlights
Sweden’s NATO bid as a strategic issue for Russia, as
well as Sweden and Turkey’s relationship as a major
wedge that Russia could exploit in future influence
operations.

any more successful than any of
their previous campaigns in the past
year, but there are many indicators
we might look for to detect Russian

Should Russia suffer more setbacks on the battlefield, Russian actors
may seek to expand their targeting of military and humanitarian supply
chains by pursuing destructive attacks beyond Ukraine and Poland.
These possible cyberattacks, should the last year’s pattern continue,
may incorporate newer destructive malware variants as well.
Separately,
cyber intrusions
may be key for
Russia for:

1

Espionage purposes to understand
military support and political
deliberations of different nations in their
commitment to the Ukrainian resistance.

The convergence of Russian cyber hacks and information leaks
may soon rise given that several countries supporting Ukraine
hold elections. Russia, since at least 2015, has employed cyber
and influence campaigns across western elections to elevate
candidates favorable for the Kremlin’s foreign policy objectives.
Poland, Estonia, Finland—all have elections in 2023 where a
change in leadership and political governance could alter support
for Ukraine. Add to this to Finland and Sweden’s bids for NATO
