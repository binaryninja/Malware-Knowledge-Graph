Shlayer malware detected allows an attacker to bypass Gatekeeper, Notarization and File
Quarantine security technologies in macOS. The exploit allows unapproved software to run
on Mac and is distributed via compromised websites or poisoned search engine results.
In a recent blog post, Objective-See covered that prior to macOS 11.3, an attacker could
craft a fake application bundle using a script as the primary executable allowing them to
bypass File Quarantine, Gatekeeper and Notarization on the macOS platform. All of which
are technologies in place to prevent unapproved software from running on macOS.
To make the situation more urgent, the Jamf Protect detections team observed this exploit
being used in the wild by a variant of the Shlayer adware dropper. The variant observed has
strong ties to a sample previously written about by Intego Security. In fact, both malware
samples are nearly identical. The major difference, in this case, is that the variant has been
repackaged to use a format necessary for carrying out the Gatekeeper bypass vulnerability.
The Jamf Protect detection team identified samples found to be abusing this vulnerability as
early as January 9th, 2021.
The details behind how the vulnerability can be abused by attackers are:
1/8

1. An attacker manually crafts an application bundle by using a script as the main
executable. (example:myapplication.app/Contents/MacOS/myapplication where
“myapplication” is a bash script). For this to work, the script name must match the
application name and they must not create an Info.plist file.
2. The application can then be placed in a dmg for distribution.
3. When the dmg is mounted and the application is double-clicked, the combination of a
script-based application with no Info.plist file executes without any quarantine,
signature or notarization verification. This will work on any system running macOS
versions 10.15 to 11.2.
Previous variants of this malware are known to spread via poisoned search engine results this variant is no exception. This is an approach where the malicious actors spreading the
malware create web pages with content tailored to appear in search results for common
queries or hijack legitimate websites without the knowledge of the owner. Since most search
engines automate the indexing and ranking, this leads to them inadvertently publishing links
to the malicious or hijacked sites hosting malware. In a real-world example, users could
potentially stumble upon malware when searching for any commonly used terms. This is an
example of a user searching for “Alexa and Disney” on Google Search in April 2021.

By clicking on a compromised result, in this case, the highlighted link above, the user is
redirected to a new webpage asking them to download an unsolicited software application
that looks similar to a real alert to update out-of-date software. This of course is not
something specific to Amazon, Disney, or Google, but rather malicious actors abusing search
engine indexing and/or compromising web pages.

3/8

An older variant of the Shlayer malware would deliver a dmg file that held a system link to a
shell script. This shell script would have an installer logo attached to it, providing to the user
the appearance of legitimacy. The mounted dmg also provided instructions to right-click the
file and select “Open”, in an attempt to convince the user to install the malicious application.
And while executing the file in this manner is allowed by Apple’s design, a consequence of
this method allows applications - both trusted and malicious - to be opened while bypassing
Gatekeeper’s checks altogether, leading in this instance to infecting the Mac.

4/8

The old variant of Shlayer attempting to convince a user to right-click and open the
malware.
This new variant found no longer requires the right-click method since the malware comes
packaged in the format required to abuse CVE-2021-30657.

The new Gatekeeper bypass step-by-step
After mounting the dmg and opening the installer, the user is displayed the following
application:

In further investigating of the application’s layout, more detail is revealed.

5/8

The image displayed to the user after mounting the DMG appears to be the “Install” file. In
actuality, it is just a system link that points to the 1302.app application bundle, or the
malicious application itself. By double-clicking the “Install” image in Figure C, the system
actually executes the 1302.app, where 1302.app/Contents/MacOS/1302 is just a bash script.

Due to the file path layout in which this script is set up, double-clicking the install icon
executes the script held within 1302.app and bypasses the checks performed by
Gatekeeper, described in further detail in CVE-2021-30657.

Additional malware behaviors
As mentioned previously, the contents of the bash script itself have been seen in variants of
this malware before. The script begins by invoking the “mktemp -t Installer” command to
create a unique filename. In this case,“Installer.XXXXXXXX” is created in a temporary
directory. The trailing “X’s” in the filename are automatically generated using the current
process number and/or a letter combination unique to this file instance.

Truncated Output of Bash Script Contained Within 1302.app
In a clever attempt to mask its presence from detection, the malware hides a zipped
executable at the bottom of the script itself, as seen above in Figure E.
6/8

A secondary command, “tail -c 58853 $0 | funzip -1uD9jgw > ${TEMP_NAME}” performs the
following actions:
Tail - Take the last 58853 bytes of the running script.
Funzip - Treat those bytes as a zip file and unzip it using the supplied password.
>${TEMP_NAME} - Write the newly unzipped file to the disk at the aforementioned temp file
location.
The unzipped executable file is invoked with the command “nohup,” which instructs the
process to ignore any HUP, or hangup signals. This is often used by attackers to run
programs in the background. The final unzipped payload is a sample of the Bundlore
adware, but this final payload may vary across different Shlayer samples.

Patched by Apple
Apple has patched this vulnerability in the 11.3 version of macOS. When this same malware
is executed on a patched version of macOS, the user will see a pop-up message stating that
the software “cannot be opened because the developer cannot be identified.” Since the
malicious application is not notarized or signed with a valid developer’s certificate, the
message will prompt the user to eject the mounted DMG containing the app bundle.

Conclusion
Shlayer continues to reintroduce itself with innovative ways to infect macOS-based systems.
Jamf Protect provides behavioral analytics to detect built-in scripting languages being
executed as though they are app bundles. This should help users discover malware abusing

7/8

this technique on Mac computers running macOS versions prior to 11.3, as well as other
suspicious applications. Jamf Protect defends against known malware samples of Shlayer,
including the adware variants that it drops. Jamf recommends users “patch fast and patch
often” to keep their Mac up-to-date by upgrading macOS to versions 11.3, which is available
now through the Mac App Store and provides the latest protection against the vulnerabilities
discussed in this article.
