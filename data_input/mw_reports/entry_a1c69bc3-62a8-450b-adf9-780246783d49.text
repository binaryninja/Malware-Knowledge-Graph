Anunak:
APT against financial
institutions

Disclaimer

The key is that fraud occurs within the corporate
network using internal payment gateways and internal banking systems. Thus money is stolen from
the banks and payment systems, and not from their
customers. While this is their main and most lucrative activity, the gang has also ventured into other
areas including the compromise of media groups
and other organizations for industrial espionage and
likely a trading advantage on the stock market. In
cases where the group got access to the government
agency networks their aim was espionage related.

Hereby Group-IB and Fox-IT inform that:
1. This report was prepared to provide information obtained as a result of Group-IB and
Fox-IT research.
2. Description of threat technical details in this
Report is given only to bring the appropriate

by creating awareness on the trend described
in this report. The threat technical details
published in this report in any case are not for
the promotion of fraud and/or other illegal
activities in the financial industry, high tech
industry and/or other areas.

The organized criminal group backbone are
citizens of both Russian and Ukrainian origin, but
the group also sources a number of mainstream and
specialized services from individuals and groups
originating from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
The average sum of theft in the Russian territory and in the post-Soviet space is $2 million per
incident. Since 2013 they have successfully gained
access to networks of more than 50 Russian banks
and 5 payment systems, and 2 of these institutions
were deprived of their banking license. To date the
total amount of theft is over 1 billion rubles (about
25 million dollars), most of it has been stolen in the
second half of 2014.

Executive summary

The average time from the moment of penetration
into the financial institutions internal network till
successful theft is 42 days.

This report describes the details and type of operations carried out by an organized criminal group
that focuses on financial industry, such as banks and
payment providers, retail industry and news, media
and PR companies. The group has its origin in more
common financial fraud including theft from consumer and corporate bank accounts in Europe and
Russia, using standard banking malware, mainly
Carberp.

As a result of access to internal bank networks
the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM
management infrastructure and infect those systems with their own malicious software that further
allows theft from the banks ATM systems on the
attackers command.

After the arrests of Carberp group members in
Russia, some of the members were out of work,
however, their experience gained from many years
of crime has allowed them to enter a new niche. One
of the members quickly realized that they can steal
$2000 a thousand times, and earn $2 million, but
also they can steal it in one time and immediately
get it with much less effort. The anti-fraud measures
employed by banks has pushed the criminals to
search for new ways to make money with less barriers, compromising and modifying or taking data
from banks, payment providers, retail and media/
PR companies are some of these methods.

Since 2014 the organized criminal group members began actively taking an interest in US and European based retail organizations. While they were
already familiar with POS malware and compromising POS terminals, the widespread media attention
around the Target breach and other related breaches
were the reason for this move. While the scale of
breaches in this industry is still relatively low, with
at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen
retailers compromised this activity is quickly becoming a lucrative endeavor for this group.
To penetrate into the internal networks this
organized criminal group employs targeted emailing
(spear phishing) and infections sources from other
botnets. This is the main reason why the group is

From 2013 an organized criminal group intensified its activity focused on banks and electronic payment systems in Russia and in the post-Soviet space.

keeping in touch with owners of large botnets. Since
August 2014 the group began to create their own
large botnet using a mass emailing, but not using
typical exploit driveby infections. This last move is
likely to reduce the need for external contacts.

9. Configuring remote access to servers of interest including firewall configuration changes.

The first successful bank robbery was committed
by this group in January 2013. In all first cases the
attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote
access to the bank network and the program “MBR
Eraser” to remove traces and to crack Windows
computers and servers. Both programs were used by
the members of the Carberp criminal group under
the guidance of a person named Germes. To reduce
the risk of losing access to the internal bank network
the attackers, in addition to malicious programs,
were also used for remote access legitimate programs such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer. Later the attackers completely abandoned from usage
of RDPdoor and Team Viewer.

To o l s f o r attac k
To carry out target attacks in 2014 the hackers
have finalized development of their core malware
Anunak that is used along with the following tools:

In addition to banking and payment systems,
hackers got access to e-mail servers to control all
internal communications. This approach allowed
them to find out that the anomalous activity in the
bank network was identified, what technique was
used to identify this activity and what measures the
bank employees took to solve the problem. Email
control was successfully installed regardless of used
email system, MS Exchange or Lotus. This approach
allowed them to take countermeasures that created
for bank and payment system employees the feeling
that the problem had been solved.
The main steps of the attack progression are the
following ones:
1.

Program

Purpose of use

Mimikatz

to get passwords from local and
domain accounts

MBR Eraser

to crack operating systems

SoftPerfect
Network Scanner

to scan LAN

Cain & Abel

to get passwords

SSHD backdoor

to get passwords
and remote access

Ammy Admin

for remote control

Team Viewer

for remote control

According to our laboratory classification the
main malware is “Anunak”. This trojan is used for
target attacks only, mainly on banks and payment
systems. Target usage of this program allows it to
remain poorly explored, providing it a good survivability inside corporate networks. The source code of
the bank trojan program Carberp was used in some
places of this malware. “Anunak” has the following
feature set:

Primary infection of an ordinary employee
computer.

2. Getting a password of a user with administrative rights on some computers. For example, a
password of a technical support engineer.

•

3. Gaining legitimate access to one server.
4. Compromising the domain administrator
password from the server.
5.

Gaining access to server and banking system
administrator workstations.

Gaining access to the domain controller and
compromising of all active domain accounts.

3

The software called “Mimikatz” is built in this
program. This is an open source software that allows to obtain passwords of user accounts logged
in the Windows system. However, this software
was considerably changed: while maintaining the
capability to get account passwords the functions
of user interaction and of information output for
errors and program execution were eliminated.
Thus, when the malicious program is executed
on the server, it will secretly compromise all the

attacker gets remote access to the user computer
with the running program “AmmyAdmin” bypassing
firewalls. The window screenshot is shown in the
figure below:

domain and local accounts, including administrator accounts. To get account passwords it is
sufficient to enter two commands in succession:
“privilege::debug” and “sekurlsa::logonpasswords”. When this program is executed on a
domain controller or an e-mail server it compromises virtually all the domain accounts, including administrators.
•

There is also the possibility to add a file into the
firewall exclusion list by creating the corresponding rule with the utility “Netsh”.

•

The functions of keypress grabber as well as the
function of screenshot creation are implemented
in the program.

•

There are also the functions to interact with the
bank system iFOBS.

•

The malware sends key information, screenshots
and CAB-archives to its management server.

•

When the attackers gain access to servers running
operating systems of the Linux family they use SSH
backdoor that transmits to the malicious server the
login/password data used to access the servers and
provides attackers remote access to the servers.
To provide access to the server of interest the attackers may appropriately modify rules for firewalls
Microsoft TMG, CISCO, etc.
When the attackers yet had no major malware
that would secretly install the program “AmmyAdmin” and report to the attackers a remote access
password, they used a malicious program known
as “Barus”. This malware is used rarely and the last
time we met it in 2013. This malicious program is
developed by Russian-speaking authors. In the
control panel you can notice a field “Ammy ID”, its
usage allowed the attackers to connect remotely.

The program is able to secretly make changes to
a number of system files, presumably to remove
the limitations of Microsoft Windows desktop
operating systems on the number of users that
may simultaneously connect to the corresponding PC using RDP to administer it remotely.

There is the ability to download arbitrary executable files from the management server and run
them. One of these files is the program “AmmyAdmin” that may be run with the arguments “-service”
and “-nogui” that force it to start as a service without
user interface. “AmmyAdmin” allows to connect
with another computer that has the same software
through the server “rl.ammyy.com” using the IP
address and the unique identifier. As a result, the

ware. The attackers buy from these botnet owners
the information about IP-addresses of computers
where the botnet owners have installed malware and
then check whether the IP-address belongs to the
financial and government institutions. If the malware is in the subnet of interest, the attackers pay
the large botnet owner for installation of their target
malware. Such partner relations were established
with owners of botnets Zeus, Shiz Ranbyus. All of
these trojans are bank Trojans, their usage is explained by the previously established relationships.
In late 2013 the hacker under the alias Dinhold began to build his own botnet using modified Carberp,
having uploaded its source code for public access.
The attackers were trying to create similar relations
with this hacker, but in 2014 he was arrested, having
not developed his botnet up to the required level.

At the very beginning of their activity in 2013 due
to lack of the target Trojan the attackers began to
distribute Andromeda and Pony. They distributed
these malware using Driveby through a bunch of
Neutrino Exploit Kit exploits as shown in the figure
below. It is interesting that in the autumn 2013 they
used the site http://php.net/ as traffic source to
Magnitude EK. They redirected the traffic from this
resource since July 2013, but this fact was discovered much later. The name of one of the streams to
distribute the malware is “LOL BANK FUCKIUNG”
that corresponded to the attacker activities.
Parallel to this technique they also use another
infection method, which was one of the principal
methods. The main method of distribution is sending emails with malicious attachments on behalf of
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, a potential client or an real counterparty (at first the attackers had cracked this counterparty account, then they
used emailing with the cracked contact list).

To check whether the IP-address belongs to the
desired network the following script is used:
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*import os
from bulkwhois.shadowserver import BulkWhoisShadowserver
iplist_file = ‘ip.txt’
path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
bulk_whois = BulkWhoisShadowserver()
iplist = []
with open(os.path.join(path, iplist_file)) as f:
for line in f:

Another used method is to install a special
malware to carry out targeted attacks via another
malware that might appear in the local network
by accident. To find such malicious programs the
criminal group keeps in touch with several owners of
large botnets that massively distributes their mal-

The most dangerous emailings
are those that are sent on behalf
of partners with whom financial
and government institutions
communicates permanently
by email. An example of such
emailing occurred on September 25, 2014, at 14:11, from the
e-mail address “Elina Shchekina
<e.shekina@rbkmoney.com>”
with the subject “Updated agreement version”. The attachment
“agreement.doc” exploits the vulnerability CVE-2012-2539 and
CVE-2012-0158. The emailing

was conducted for more than
70 addresses of various companies (where multiple recipient
addresses may be within one
company).
The letter with malicious

in the archive with a password
from a potential client was sent
to a bank manager after a preliminary telephone conversation
with him. The call origin is Saint
Petersburg.

Availability of access to bank internal networks
opens great opportunities for the hackers. One of
these opportunities is access to ATMs from special network segments that had to be isolated. It is
confirmed that this criminal group gained access to
52 ATMs. The amount of damage exceeds 50 million
rubles. As a result of access to ATMs, depending on
the ATM model, hackers used different patterns.

Having access, the attackers downloaded malicious scripts and changed denominations of issued
banknotes in the ATM operating system registry. As
a result, for query to get 10 notes with denomination
of 100 roubles the attackers received 10 banknotes
with denomination of 5,000 roubles. The used
malicious script and program were developed for the
platform Wincor.

REG ADD “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\
Wincor Nixdorf\ProTopas\CurrentVersion\LYNXPAR\CASH_DISPENSER” /v VALUE_1 /t REG_SZ

REG ADD “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\
Wincor Nixdorf\ProTopas\CurrentVersion\LYNXPAR\CASH_DISPENSER” /v VALUE_4 /t REG_SZ

The malicious script contains the following
commands:

program that allows by the command to issue money from the dispenser. The original debug program
issues money through the dispenser only when the
open ATM housing and the vault door are fixed.

Execution of this file changed registry keys in
the registry branch ““HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SOFTWARE\Wincor Nixdorf\ProTopas\CurrentVersion\LYNXPAR\CASH_DISPENSER”” that are
responsible for cassette denominations in an ATM.
As a result of this file execution the registry key that
is in charge of the cassette number 1 (VALUE_1) is
takes the value “100”, and the registry key responsible for the cassette number 4 (VALUE_4) is set to
“5000”. Then the command to restart the computer
is issued. The registry key reference values:

In order to ensure money issuance from the
closed ATM the attackers had to modify the
original program “KDIAG32” (the original file:
size of 1,128,960 MD5 4CC1A6E049942EBDA395244C74179EFF).

A comparison of the original version of the program with the modified version showed that the only
difference is in ignoring error ““Door not opened or
missing!””. The figure below shows an error message
that will be never displayed to the user in the file
under investigation.

If the ATM actual load corresponds to the reference one and registry keys have been changed, then
the banknotes from the cassette No.1 will be issued
with denomination “5000” instead of “100”.

cases of trojan Anunak usage.
However, in this case Andromeda is used as the main trojan
instead of Anunak. The management servers were located
in Kazakhstan, Germany and
Ukraine. Check of the management servers showed that it was
the hosting Bulletproof that, in
addition to servers, provides
a service of traffic proxying
through its infrastructure as
well as TOR and VPN usage,

victim type (a bank or a payment system), thirdly by
the total stolen sum.
The victims by their type were divided rather by
counterparty types and by limitations imposed by
operation with the counterparties. For example, all
payments were required to go through a certain pool
of mediators. In addition, the “improper” pool of
counterparties could cause suspicion and unnecessary testing (manual processing of payment orders).

Obtained Andromeda trojan copies were being
distributed from August 2014 by e-mail. The value
754037e7be8f61cbb1b85ab46c7da77d, which is the
MD5 hash of the string “go fuck yourself”, was used
as the RC4 encryption key. As a result of this distribution from August to late October the Andromeda
botnet rose up to 260,000 bots. Successful infection
in one subnet resulted in sending such letters to
other bank employees. Example of forwarding from
an infected bank network to employees of another
bank is shown below.

Bank (amounts up to 100 million roubles):

As a result of this radial mailing many oil and gas
companies, banks and government agencies were infected. In Russia at least 15 banks and two payment
systems were infected this way.

When the attackers had obtained control of a
bank operator workstation (attacker purpose),
they in general used a classic tree scheme when
funds from the bank account were sent to several
legal entities, then from each legal entity to
smaller legal entities (may be several such iterations) and then to private person credit cards
(from 600 to 7000 transactions).

•

When the attackers had obtained control of ATM
management service (attacker purpose), money
were withdrawn directly from the ATM by the attacker command. In this case the whole cashout
process consisted in that a drop person had to be
near the ATM at the specified time with a bag to
empty the dispenser.

Letters with similar attachments were being distributed with the following subjects:
“My new photo”
“Alert Transactions Report by users from 201409-28 to 2014-09-28”

In addition to all the above methods, cash
sending channels were also employed through
the settlements systems, electronic wallets and
payment systems, such as web money, Yandex

Money, QIWI (1500-2000 transactions). Revenues of large amounts (up to 50 million roubles)
were recorded to particular cards of private persons who then used these cards to buy expensive
small-sized goods such as jewelry, watches, and
other attributes. A huge part of the money was
sent through mobile operators (1500-2000 SIM
cards prepared in advance).

to number of thefts too (number of victims +
average stolen sum per 1 victim). The groups
are working in different cities to ensure better
cashout distribution. Also these groups include
immigrants from former Soviet republics who if
necessary arrive in the required city. Each group
was monitored by a separate person. Each group
consists of about 15-20 people.

In spring 2014 (high time of this fraud type) 2

and Anunak variants. This was one of the main
methods for the group using Anunak to obtain interesting infections in the middle of 2014, sourcing
infections from other botnet operators.More recently other infection methods, including spear phishing
using English language and possibly also usage of
the teams own Andromeda, but also SQL injection
to breach an organization directly from the outside,
has been employed by this team.

While the attacks in Russia against banks and
payment systems have occurred over the past two
years, the attacks against the retail industry is only
something which started in the second quarter of
2014. With at least three confirmed breaches where
card track data was obtainedand a total of at least 16
breaches at retail organizations, it is also becoming a
serious threat.
Apart from retail organizations it is also known
that a number of media and PR companies have
been breached in 2014. While it is not entirely certain, the type of breaches suggest that the attackers
are looking for inside information, a type of industrial espionage, allowing them to gain an advantage
on the stock market. As there is nothing specifically
missing and the resulting fraud is hard to match
with anything, these incidents typically are never
linked.

pos compromises

The first known attacks with Anunak targeted
a specific brand of POS systems which revolved
around the Epicor/NSB brand. To do this Anunak
has specific code to target POS devices equipped
with this software, which in contrary to the more
common memory scanning track data scrapers, logs
a wealth of information from the payments done by
the cards. The first case this was seen active was in
July 2014, but it might have been earlier as well.
More recent breaches have used a new custom
developed POS malware, which is a more simple
but reliable track data memory scraper. The initial
version from the early fall of 2014 used a simple
blacklist, scraped every process and dumped track
data in plain text. More recent versions scanned
only configuration specified processes and used RC4
to encrypt the extracted track data records on disk.

sector.
additional targets

While the retail industry is one of its main targets
due to its payment processing capabilities, other
compromises might occur indirectly, for example to
obtain databases with information or other information that is of value to the organized criminal group.
One of the possibilities is obtaining lists of corporate
email addresses to have a higher chance of interesting infections.

infection methods

From the retail perspective, the first infections in
2014 were sourced from a botnet which employs a
widely deployed crypto-currency mining malware
based on the Gozi/ISFB (banking) malware family.
Based on our insights we believe during the first
half of 2014 over half a million systems had been
compromised by this malware from over the whole
world, however Russia and a number of post-Soviet
states were clean of infections. To find interesting
infections within this large set of compromised
systems, the malware extracts relevant information
from the systems including Microsoft Windows
organization registration information and network/
Windows domain information.

At this moment we have no evidence of successful
compromise or theft of banks and payment systems
outside of Russia, but several infections in the east
of Europe (specifically Ukraine and Latvia) were
active in 2014. These specific infections were related
to infrastructure of organizations based in Russia or
with significant interests in Russia, thus more likely
related to the breaches at the same organization in
Russia.

The Gozi/ISFB based malware was used to drop
additional components on interesting systems,
which included Metasploit/Meterpreter payloads

The majority of infections from Europe were from
dedicated servers used as exit node for VPN services,

promised organizations were methods employed by
these attackers. This also includes video captures
made by the Anunak malware, allowing attackers to

the systems infected were likely from Eastern European or Russian origin, and possibly test infections
from the attackers. We have no evidence of compromises against banks in Western Europe or United
States, but it should be noted that the attackers
methods could be utilized against banks outside of
Russia as well.

methods of l ateral movement
and persistence

Group-IB is one of the leading international
companies specializing in preventing and investigating high-tech cyber crimes and fraud. The company
offers a range of services on preventing financial
and reputational damages, consulting and auditing
of information security systems, and on computer
forensics. The company also develops a number of
innovative software products used to monitor, detect
and prevent emerging cyber threats.

The group uses Metasploit as one of their main
hacking tools, either stand alone or as part of a
framework. The activity includes port scanning and
system reconnaissance, escalating privileges on
systems by using for example the recent CVE-20144113 vulnerability, gathering credentials and hopping on to other systems and networks. Metasploit
is being used to its full potential with scanning,
exploiting, privilege escalation and post exploitation
persistence being achieved with its standard toolset.

The Group-IB team is made up of experts with
unique skills and solid practical experience. They
are internationally certified by CISSP, CISA, CISM,
CEH, CWSP, GCFA and also have information
security state certificates. In 2013, computer security incident response team CERT-GIB operated by
Group-IB became a member of FIRST — Forum of
Incident Response and Security Teams.

On interesting and critical systems typical hacking tools might be found to establish tunnels out
of the network, either tools that are part of the
Metasploit framework such as Meterpreter, but also
other tools to achieve persistence on those systems.
The connect back methods seen are typically SSL
over port 443, but also DNS based methods were
observed. The attackers use BITS to download files,
but also make use of Windows built-in PowerShell to
download tools and execute commands. Finally on
the critical systems freshly crypted and non-detected
versions of Anunak are deployed, typically these are
used in very limited deployments thus their spread
is limited and detection by Anti-Virus is very rare.

In 2013, the company became a member of the
international cyber security alliance IMPACT (International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber
Threats).

connecting to backends, which includes a PHP based
backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS, and a
Windows server based component using a proprietary protocol.
The use of VNC scanning and password brute
forcing, the adding of additional administrator
accounts, use of RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent
RDP sessions are all methods to gain access and
achieve persistent access to compromised systems
employed by this group. Additionally various ways
