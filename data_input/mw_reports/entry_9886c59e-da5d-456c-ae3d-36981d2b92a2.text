Listen to post:
During a recent malware hunt[1], the Cato research team identified some unique attributes of
DGA algorithms that can help security teams automatically spot malware on their network.

The “Shimmy” DGA
DGAs (Domain Generator Algorithms) are used by attackers to generate a large number of –
you guessed it – domains often used for C&C servers. Spotting DGAs can be difficult without
a clear, searchable pattern.
Cato researchers began by collecting traffic metadata from malicious Chrome extensions to
their C&C services. Cato maintains a data warehouse built from the metadata of all traffic
flows crossing its global private backbone. We analyze those flows for suspicious traffic to
hunt threats on a daily basis.
The researchers were able to identify the same traffic patterns and network behavior in traffic
originating from 80 different malicious Chrome extensions, which were identified as from the
Bujo, Dealply and ManageX families of malicious extensions. By examining the C&C
domains, researchers observed an algorithm used to create the malicious domains. In many
cases, DGAs appear as random characters. In some cases, the domains contain numbers,
and in other cases the domains are very long, making them look suspicious.

Here are a few examples of the C&C domains (full domain list at the end of this post):
qalus.com

jurokotu.com

bunafo.com

naqodur.com

womohu.com

bosojojo.com

mucac.com

kuqotaj.com

bunupoj.com

pocakaqu.com

wuqah.com

dubocoso.com

sanaju.com

lufacam.com

cajato.com

qunadap.com

dagaju.com

fupoj.com

The most obvious trait the domains have in common is that they are all part of “.com” TLD
(Top-Level Domain). Also, all the prefixes are five to eight letters long.
There are other factors shared by the domains. For one, they all start with consonants and
then create a pattern that is built out of consonants and vowels; so that every domain is
represented by consonant + vowel + consonant + vowel + consonant, etc. As an example, in
jurokotu.com domain, removing the TLD will bring “jurokotu”, and coloring the word to
consonants (red) and vowels (blue) will show the pattern: “jurokotu”.
From the domains we collected, we could see that the adversaries used the vowels: o, u and
a, and consonants: q, m, s, p, r, j, k, l, w, b, c, n, d, f, t, h, and g. Clearly, an algorithm has
been used to create these domains and the intention was to make them look as close to real
words as possible.

“Shimmy” DGA infrastructure
A few additional notable findings are related to the same common infrastructure used by all
the C&C domains.
All domains are registered using the same registrar – Gal Communication (CommuniGal)
Ltd. (GalComm), which was previously associated with registration of malicious domains [2].

The domains are also classified as ‘uncategorized’ by classification engines, another sign
that these domains are being used by malware. Trying to access the domains via browser,
will either get you a landing page or HTTP ERROR 403 (Forbidden). However, we believe
that there are server controls that allow access to the malicious extensions based on specific
http headers.
All domains are translated to IP addresses belonging to Amazon AWS, part of AS16509. The
domains do not share the same IP, and from time to time it seems that the IP for a particular
domain is changed dynamically, as can be seen in this example:
tawuhoju.com

13.224.161.119

14/04/2021

tawuhoju.com

13.224.161.119

15/04/2021

tawuhoju.com

13.224.161.22

23/04/2021

tawuhoju.com

13.224.161.22

24/04/2021

Wrapping Up
Given all this evidence, it’s clear to us that the infrastructure used on these campaigns is
leveraging AWS and that it is a very large campaign. We identified many connection points
between 80 C&C domains, identifying their DGA and infrastructure. This could be used to
identify the C&C communication and infected machines, by analyzing network traffic.
Security teams can now use these insights to identify the traffic from malicious Chrome
extensions.
