On July 17, 2017, we detected a malicious document in VirusTotal exploiting CVE-2017-0199. By

Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Using

pivoting off of the infrastructure we learned that it is related to Winnti, a Chinese threat actor that is

KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA

mostly targeting the gaming industry. Below we outline initial ndings.
The malicious le, named curriculum vitae.rtf (58c66b3ddbc0df9810119bb688ea8fb0) was uploaded
from Turkey. Its content is presented below (we redacted personally identi able information):

Jerusalem Post and other Israeli websites
compromised by Iranian threat agent CopyKitten
Operation Electric Powder - Who is targeting Israel
Electric Company?

When the document is opened, it downloads and runs a le from the following URL:

http://54.245.195[.]101/test.rtf
Which contains a short VBS script:

The script downloads and runs an executable (a4b2a6883ba0451429df29506a1f6995) from the
following URL:

http://54.245.195[.]101/shell.exe
Which uses backup.aolonline[.]cc as command and control server.

Indicators of compromise
Pivoting on IPs, code signing certi cates, and domain registration details, we found further parts of the
infrastructure, some got back to 2015. Most of them have been tagged as relating to “Casper aka LEAD”
in a public PassiveTotal project by Cylance (However, we could not nd a public report). Most sample
were detected by Proofpoint as “ETPRO TROJAN Casper/LEAD DNS Lookup” (this signature was
published in May 03, 2017).
