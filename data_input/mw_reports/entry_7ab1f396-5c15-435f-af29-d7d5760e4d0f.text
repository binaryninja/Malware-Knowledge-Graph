Executive Summary
Update: Lapsus$ ransomware group’s recent target is IT and software giant Globant. This article has been updated with the
analysis of the attack on Globant, which came to light on 30 March 2022.
CloudSEK’s flagship digital risk monitoring platform XVigil discovered a post on Telegram, sharing the Nvidia employee credentials,
Samsung’s Source code along with that the latest addition to those already high profile targets are Microsoft’s Cortana and Bing’s Source
code and Okta the SSO giant’s customer data was exfiltrated.

1/9

Lapsus$ ransomware gang claimed to have compromised Nvidia and now targets Samsung with the breach. Further claiming to have
gained access to source code used in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, Okta’s Customer data etc.
The ransomware gang leaked source code, dehashed credentials, code signing certificates and source code to the driver. The leaked
data unlocks the potential for threat actors to gain unauthorized access to personal, proprietary, and Intellectual Property (IP) data of
Nvidia and they have also leaked 90% source code of Bing Maps, Bing and Cortana claiming to be at 45%.
While writing this report, we have discovered that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or dox Information related to the Lapsus$
ransomware gang was released at a Russian language cybercrime forum.

This screenshot was posted on the telegram group and while analyzing closely we can see that they have access to Jira, Slack, G-Suite and
other internal applications as well. RDP access is being used in the screenshot

Analysis and Attribution
Information from the Telegram
On 22nd March, 2022 the group claimed to leak Bing Maps, Bing and Cortana source code. Our threat Intelligence team has confirmed that
these claims are true, shortly after there were official blogs from Microsoft and Okta confirming the breach.

Leaked Information shared on Telegram Channels

Original Perpetrators of Breach
The LAPSUS$ cyber-criminal group has been known to exploit the weakest link in the security chain of a corporate network: Human mistakes
and bad practices.
They achieve initial access using the following tactics:
Redline Malware stealer logs, which can be understood here

2/9

Popular market places like amigos, russian-market to get logs, credentials and session tokens to get access.
They are known to pay insiders to provide them with VPN, VDI(citrix), Identity providers and even RDP access

Lapsus Recruitment Post

Publicly available secrets on github/gitlab repositories
The next steps involve Privilege escalation and Post Exploitation:
Exploiting existing vulnerabilities which include unpatched versions of Jira, confluence, Fortiguard, Microsoft exchange servers etc.. We
have created a list of curated vulnerabilities that they target
Accessing version control systems and looking at private repositories to gain access to secrets and gems
They also access mailboxes/collaboration software like slack to get access to credentials being shared in plain text.

They have highlighted the post-exploitation steps they took as a part of the

response to Okta’s latest blog.
Microsoft Leak Analysis:
Microsoft in an official blog today has stated the following:
“This week, the actor made public claims that they had gained access to Microsoft and exfiltrated portions of source code. No
customer code or data was involved in the observed activities. Our investigation has found a single account had been compromised,
granting limited access. Our cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent further
activity. Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation
of risk.”

The leak contains 56484 directories, 333743 files and the source code for Cortana, Bing Maps and Bing. The aggregate size of the data
leaked is 37.8 GB.

The leak also contains multiple sensitive endpoints like the one mentioned in the above screenshot. Similarly there are 135 .pfx files which are
present in the leak. A pfx file contains the SSL certificate(public key) and the corresponding private key. These can in turn be used maliciously.
3/9

There are documentation files as well as internal pdf files:

By looking at the files we can conclude the following:
No customer data was affected
No PII was leaked
Source code along with certificates and pfx files were leaked
The Lapsus$ group is not very strong with Operational Security as they posted a Proof of Concept in the Telegram channel while the
exfiltration was still underway

Okta Breach Analysis:
Okta has also released a statement earlier in the form of a blog stating:
“Okta detected an unsuccessful attempt to compromise the account of a customer support engineer working for a third-party provider.
As part of our regular procedures, we alerted the provider to the situation, while simultaneously terminating the user’s active
Okta sessions and suspending the individual’s account. Following those actions, we shared pertinent information (including
suspicious IP addresses) to supplement their investigation, which was supported by a third-party forensics firm.”
“After a thorough analysis of these claims, we have concluded that a small percentage of customers – approximately 2.5% – have
potentially been impacted and whose data may have been viewed or acted upon. We have identified those customers and are contacting
them directly. If you are an Okta customer and were impacted, we have already reached out directly by email. We are sharing this
interim update, consistent with our values of customer success, integrity, and transparency”

In response to the above statement, Lapsus$ group has also released a message which can be summarized in the following points:
They were successful in breaching a Superuser/Admin account that had access to Slack, Jira, Confluence boards etc ..

4/9

It is suspicious that the customer support engineer had access to ~8.6k slack channels and internal applications.
They had access to internal AWS secret and key pairs/ other API keys as they were being shared in plain text over Slack and emails
The breached account had the ability to reset the Password and MFA of ~95% of their clientele

The screenshot was shared by Lapsus as a POC claiming they had access to Slack and other applications.
Globant Leak Analysis:
Globant in an official confirmation has not contested the claim of Lapsus$. Globant released the following statement:
“We have recently detected that a limited section of our company’s code repository has been subject to unauthorized access. We have
activated our security protocols and are conducting an exhaustive investigation. According to our current analysis, the information that was
accessed was limited to certain source code and project-related documentation for a very limited number of clients. To date, we have not found
any evidence that other areas of our infrastructure systems or those of our clients were affected”
The 70 GB data leak contains public and private keys (SSH and SSL) present in the leak asa part of their source code. It consists of the
following information for a number of their clients:

Information from the Cyber Crime forum
Lapsus Ransomware group emerged in early January 2022.
The group is actively operating over their Telegram channel and engages with subscribers. They keep their subscribers updated on their
upcoming data breaches and host polls.
Recently, we came across a post on a Russian speaking cybercrime forum that mentioned PII as the operator of the Lapsus$ group.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
Nvidia was targeted by Lapsus$ group last month. Subsequently, earlier this month, malware samples began to appear in the wild, signed with
Nvidia certificates. Some of these samples have got very low detection on VirusTotal because of the legitimate certificates attached, and hence
could pose a threat. Following are the malware samples signed with stolen certificates:

Impact & Mitigation
Impact

Mitigation

The published credentials could enable other threat actors to gain access to the
organization’s networks. The exposed Personally Identifiable Information (PII) could
enable threat actors to orchestrate social engineering schemes, phishing attacks,
and even identity theft. Since password reuse is a common practice, threat actors
could leverage the exposed credentials to gain access to the users’ other
accounts. Exposed IP addresses and login credentials can lead to potential account
takeovers.The exposed confidential details could reveal business practices and
intellectual property.

Reset the compromised user login credentials and
Implement a strong password policy for all user
accounts. Check for possible workarounds and
patches while keeping the ports open. Use MFA
(multi-factor authentication) across logins.Patch all
vulnerable and exploitable endpoints. Monitor for
anomalies, in user accounts and systems, that could
be indicators of possible takeovers.
