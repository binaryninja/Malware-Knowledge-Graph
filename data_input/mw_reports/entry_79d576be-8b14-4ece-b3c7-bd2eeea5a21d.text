Investigating and Mitigating Malicious Drivers
msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/06/25/investigating-and-mitigating-malicious-drivers/

The security landscape continues to rapidly evolve as threat actors find new and innovative
methods to gain access to environments across a wide range of vectors. As the industry
moves closer to the adoption of a Zero Trust security posture with broad and layered
defenses, we remain committed to sharing threat intelligence with the community to shine a
light on the latest techniques and exploits of attackers so the industry can better protect
itself.
Microsoft is investigating a malicious actor distributing malicious drivers within gaming
environments. The actor submitted drivers for certification through the Windows Hardware
Compatibility Program. The drivers were built by a third party. We have suspended the
account and reviewed their submissions for additional signs of malware.

No Evidence of Certificate Exposure
We have seen no evidence that the WHCP signing certificate was exposed. The
infrastructure was not compromised. In alignment with our Zero Trust and layered defenses
security posture, we have built-in detection and blocking of this driver and associated files
through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. We are also sharing these detections with other AV
security vendors so they can proactively deploy detections.
The actor’s activity is limited to the gaming sector specifically in China and does not appear
to target enterprise environments. We are not attributing this to a nation-state actor at this
time. The actor’s goal is to use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat the system and
play from anywhere. The malware enables them to gain an advantage in games and possibly
exploit other players by compromising their accounts through common tools like keyloggers.
It’s important to understand that the techniques used in this attack occur post exploitation,
meaning an attacker must either have already gained administrative privileges in order to be
able to run the installer to update the registry and install the malicious driver the next time the
system boots or convince the user to do it on their behalf.
We will be sharing an update on how we are refining our partner access policies, validation
and the signing process to further enhance our protections. There are no actions customers
should take other than follow security best practices and deploy Antivirus software such as
Windows Defender for Endpoint.
Just like our defenders, our adversaries are creative and determined. Because of this,
Microsoft approaches security with an assume breach mentality and layered defenses. We
work tirelessly alongside our industry partners to ensure the community as a whole is aware
1/4

of new attack tools, tactics and procedures that we have observed or that have been
reported through responsible disclosure. By sharing the information we’ve learned with this
report, we are raising awareness of these techniques so that more protections can be built in
across the industry and to increase the degree of difficulty for attackers.

Additional Information on the Windows Hardware Compatibility
Program
Microsoft Defender and Windows Security teams work diligently with driver publishers to
detect security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious software. Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint’s UEFI scanner is able to scan below the operating system where
these attacks occur to add further detection and protection from these kinds of low-level
attacks. We also build automated mechanisms through Windows Update to block vulnerable
versions of drivers and protect customers against vulnerability exploits based on ecosystem
and partner engagement as this is an issue that challenges the industry at large.
Our security teams continue to work closely with the OEM and driver publishers to analyze
and patch any known vulnerabilities and to update affected devices prior to shipment. Once
the driver publisher patches the vulnerability, an update to all affected drivers is pushed out
via the Windows Update (WU) platform. Once affected devices receive the latest security
patches, drivers with confirmed security vulnerabilities are blocked on Windows 10 devices
using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) and Microsoft
Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) technologies to protect devices against
exploits. More information is available via our Microsoft recommended driver block rules
document.

Indicators of compromise
In addition to creating antimalware signatures for Microsoft Defender antivirus, sharing key
detection guidance with our AV partners, we are also sharing these hashes and IP
addresses for other defenders to leverage.
