Combating Aurora
Overview
“Operation Aurora,” released the week of January 11, exploits the recent Microsoft
Internet Explorer vulnerability. The attack was initially targeted at several large
companies, including Google. It is now public and is available on the web. The public
release significantly increases the possibility of widespread attacks exploiting the
vulnerability, putting Internet Explorer users at potentially serious risk.
Microsoft is aware of the targeted attacks and lists the following combinations as
vulnerable: Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack
4, and Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on supported
editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,
Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

Below we have a summary of McAfee’s assessment of Internet Explorer and platform
risks:

* DEP
2

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a set of hardware and software technologies that
perform additional checks on memory to help prevent malicious code from running
on a system. In Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Microsoft
Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, DEP is enforced by hardware and by software.
The primary benefit of DEP is to help prevent code execution from data pages.
Typically, code is not executed from the default heap and the stack. Hardwareenforced DEP detects code that is running from these locations and raises an
exception when execution occurs. Software-enforced DEP can help prevent malicious
code from taking advantage of exception-handling mechanisms in Windows.

McAfee detection names for Aurora

Exploit-Comele
This maliciously crafted script attempts to exploit the vulnerability when Internet
Explorer handles certain DOM operations.
An attacker may exploit this issue to execute remote code.

Roarur.dr
This Trojan drops further malicious files onto the victim’s computer.
http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_253415.htm

Roarur.dll
This Trojan is dropped by the roarur.dr Trojan.
The dll creates an additional service on the victim’s computer and checks for certain files
on the system. The files it looks for are

• acelpvc.dll (presence of this file does not necessarily imply an infection ) . acelpvc.dll
is used to stream live desktop feeds to the attacker

• VedioDriver.dll (presence of this file does not necessarily imply an infection )- Helper
dll for acelpvc.dll

flaw lies in Internet Explorer's handling of certain DOM operations.
Exploitation can occur via a maliciously crafted file or a maliciously crafted
web page and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Failed exploit
attempts may result in an application crash (denial of service).

Importance

High. On January 14 Microsoft publicly disclosed this vulnerability. Active
exploitation has been observed in the wild.

Cleaning and Repair
A full on-demand scan must run to completely clean an infected host. In some cases, it
may also be necessary to run the on-demand scan in Safe Mode, as well as run a second
scan after a reboot. It is critical that the on-demand scan be configured properly.
The proper configuration:
• Scan All Local Drives
• Memory for Rootkits
• Running Processes
• Registry
• First “Action” set to “Clean”
The full, recommended process:
• Launch a full on-demand scan with the prior-documented configuration
• Allow the scan to run to completion
• Reboot
• Launch a second on-demand scan and allow it to run to completion to verify that
the system has been cleaned
