On July 19, 2021, a threat actor operating under the alias “BlackMatter” registered an
account on the high-tier Russian-language illicit forums XSS and Exploit. The actor
deposited 4 BTC (approximately $150,000 USD) into their escrow account. Large deposits
on the forum indicate the seriousness of the threat actor.

BlackMatter Registration
On July 19, 2021, a threat actor operating under the alias “BlackMatter” registered an
account on the high-tier Russian-language illicit forums XSS and Exploit. The actor
deposited 4 BTC (approximately $150,000 USD) into their escrow account. Large deposits
on the forum indicate the seriousness of the threat actor. On July 21, the threat actor posted
a notice on the forums, stating they are looking to purchase access to infected corporate
networks in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, presumably for ransomware operations.
The threat actor said they are looking for larger corporate networks with revenues of over US
$100 million.

While the inclusion of Five Eyes countries is notable, it is likely more financially-motivated
than strategic. US, Canada, Australia, and the UK are ranked among the top 10 mosttargeted countries for publicly-reported incidents on ransomware blogs and, further, the April
2021 paper from the Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware Task Force
highlighted that White House and DNI would coordinate with Five Eyes on a number of
action items for combating ransomware.1 Recent reports highlight intelligence sharing with
partner countries on suspicious cryptocurrency transactions in foreign exchanges.2

Re-emergence?
The timing of the post is interesting in that it occurred two months after XSS, Exploit, and
Raid Forums banished the DarkSide ransomware group, and forbade the discussion and
solicitation of ransomware with the forums. DarkSide ransomware group was responsible for
extorting Colonial Pipeline, resulting in a disruption in one of the largest oil pipelines in the
United States. Shortly after the incident, DarkSide’s blog was offline and the Justice
Department claimed that they recovered $2.3 million from Colonial’s ransomware payment.3
“UNKN” (aka “Unknown”) a representative of REvil, relayed DarkSide’s shutdown through a
forum post.

On July 13, 2021, REvil abruptly shut down their ransomware blog. On the same day, XSS
banned REvil’s spokesperson UNKN. The shutdown followed REvil’s high-profile
ransomware attack against the technology provider, Kaseya.
BlackMatter does not openly state that they are a ransomware collective operator, which
technically doesn’t break the rules of the forums, though the language of their post, as well
as their goals clearly indicate that they are a ransomware collective operator.

Re-branding?
The emergence of a new group following the closure of DarkSide and REvil leaves threat
actors questioning their origins, and if this is a possible rebranding. Both BlackMatter and
UNKN appear to have similar rules around targeting. For example, both BlackMatter and
UNKN explicitly say they will not target medical and government institutions. Regarding
tactics, both groups use the same public corporate databases to research possible victims.
Furthermore, Flashpoint analysts note that REvil previously labeled their Windows Registry
key “BlackLivesMatter.”

While the information may not be a smoking gun, it may indicate that REvil has not gone
totally offline, but merely took a small hiatus following some high-profile breaches. It is also
important to note that two posts and a large escrow account do not make a ransomware
group. It is possible that copycats are intentionally mimicking the behavior of REvil to gain
immediate credibility for allegedly being the reincarnation of REvil.

Ran Somewhere? No, Still Here
While recent bans on forums made it significantly harder for ransomware collectives to
recruit partners, nevertheless ransomware collectives are finding new creative avenues to
attract threat actors, who would be interested in working with them.
For instance, on July 22, 2021, Flashpoint observed an advertisement of the partner program
of the AvosLocker Ransomware collective. The advertisement was distributed on Jabber via
a service called “HQ Advert Services,” which specializes in mass spam campaigns via
Jabber and Telegram. HQ Advert and other similar services maintain a list of Jabber and
Telegram handles and are able to distribute the advertisements of interest for a fee.
Prior to that, ransomware actors have also maintained communications on a number of other
platforms. Some, such as Black Shadow, maintain Telegram accounts, others, such as
LockBit 2.0, run ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) recruitment on their forums, and still
others have moved to new forums for RaaS recruitment such as Babuk’s RAMP forum.
At this time, we can only assess the possible origins and intentions of BlackMatter. Their
presence on XSS and Exploit highlights the increasing importance of those forums in
ransomware recruitment, despite the apparent bans in May 2021.

Re-recruitment
On July 27, the group began recruiting potential partners and affiliates via IM protocol,
Jabber. Notably, the group is using Exploit’s Jabber server to send out their recruitment
message, again showing ransomware groups utilizing Exploit’s infrastructure to forward their
nefarious agenda despite an alleged ban.
In the advertisement, BlackMatter announced they were looking for experienced penetration
testers who work with Windows and Linux systems and initial access suppliers, who would
either sell their access or work for a percentage of the profits. The group listed their Jabber
handle and Tox ID, and asked interested parties to contact them.

Remodel? Who Wore it Best?
Flashpoint analysts also discovered a leaks site on an onion domain run by the group, in
which BlackMatter expands its rules on targeting to include restrictions on targeting the oil
and gas sector and the defense and CI sector. The leaks site currently does not list any

victims.
After the discovery of the site, rumors again abounded claiming that BlackMatter is a
rebranding of the group DarkSide, which went offline after losing control of their infrastructure
in May 2021. These rumors are based on the design of the BlackMatter leaks site, which is
similar to the now-defunct DarkSide leaks site, and by the fact that BlackMatter explicitly
stated they would not target the oil and gas industry — a nod to the Colonial Pipeline breach
which proved DarkSide’s demise. At this time, there is no concrete evidence connecting the
two and
When DarkSide went offline and their alias “darksupp” was banned from the Russianlanguage illicit forum XSS, the administrators seized the group’s sizable deposit of 23 BTC
(approximately US $911,000) and distributed it among former DarkSide partners. This is
notable because such a move might have discouraged any former members of DarkSide to
make substantial deposits on illicit forums, as BlackMatter did when making a BTC 4 deposit
on Exploit.
