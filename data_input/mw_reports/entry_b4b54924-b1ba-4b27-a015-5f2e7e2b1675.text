This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by Russian state-sponsored
threat activity group NOBELIUM. The activity was identified through a
combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and analysis
derived from open source reporting. Data sources include the Recorded Future
Platform, SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Shodan, Censys,
Team Cymru’s Pure Signal™ and other common open-source tools and
techniques. The report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in
strategic and operational intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian
government in cyberspace and network defenders. Some technical details from
our original research have not been included in this report version in order to
protect tracking techniques and ongoing research into NOBELIUM activity.
Executive Summary

1/5

Recorded Future’s Insikt Group continues to monitor Russian state-sponsored
cyber espionage operations targeting government and private sector
organizations across multiple geographic regions. From mid-2021 onwards,
Recorded Future’s midpoint collection revealed a steady rise in the use of
NOBELIUM infrastructure tracked by Insikt Group as SOLARDEFLECTION,
which encompasses command and control (C2) infrastructure. In this report,
we highlight trends observed by Insikt Group while monitoring
SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure and the recurring use of typosquat
domains by its operators.
A key factor we have observed from NOBELIUM operators involved in threat
activity is a reliance on domains that emulate other brands (some legitimate
and some that are likely fictitious businesses). Domain registrations and
typosquats can enable spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose a threat
to victim networks and brands.
Using a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain
analysis techniques, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have
determined that NOBELIUM’s use of SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure
overlaps with other common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) previously attributed to the group by multiple organizations including
Microsoft, Fortinet, Sekoia, and Volexity. Previous open source reporting also
highlighted NOBELIUM’s use of cracked versions of the Cobalt Strike
penetration testing tool.
Key Judgments
Insikt Group is confident that the identified SOLARDEFLECTION
infrastructure can be attributed to the threat activity group publicly
reported as NOBELIUM; this confidence is based on the use of
overlapping network infrastructure previously attributed to NOBELIUM in
public reporting, as well as unique variations of Cobalt Strike traditionally
used by the group.
Broader themes in SOLARDEFLECTION C2 typosquats have included
the misuse of brands across multiple industry verticals, particularly in the
news and media industries.
Cobalt Strike servers related to SOLARDEFLECTION monitoring that
were also previously linked to NOBELIUM activity used modified server
configurations, likely in an attempt to remain undetected from researchers
actively scanning for standard Cobalt Strike server features.
NOBELIUM has made extensive use of typosquat domains in SSL
certificates and will likely continue to use deceptive techniques, including
typosquat redirection, when using Cobalt Strike tooling.

Background
Analysis of recent and historical domains attributed to NOBELIUM broadly
demonstrates the group’s familiarity with, and tendency to emulate, a variety of
media, news and technology providers. The group has abused dynamic DNS
resolution to construct and resolve to randomly generated subdomains for its
C2s or root domains to mislead victims. The key aspect to these attacks is the
use of either email addresses or URLs that look similar to the domain of a
legitimate organization. Potentially harmful domain registrations and typosquats
can enable spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose an elevated risk to
a company's brand or employees. A successful spearphish is dependent on
factors such as the quality of the message, the credibility of the sender
address, and, in the case of a redirecting URL, the credibility of the domain
name. Insikt Group has previously observed other Russian nexus groups using
typosquatting in support of operations, such as those aimed at the 2020
presidential elections, to increase confidence in the validity of the fraudulent
login portal used to harvest victim credentials. This tactic has also been
reported recently in open sources in connection with intrusions targeting
entities in Ukraine, likely in support of Russia’s invasion of the country.
Insikt Group assesses that NOBELIUM is a threat activity group operating in
line with the objectives of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The
SVR is tasked with providing the president of the Russian Federation, the
Federal Assembly, and the government with the intelligence they need to make
decisions in the areas of politics, the economy, military strategy, scientifictechnical strategy, and the environment. Russia’s SVR defines itself as
separate by allowing the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to focus
on military intelligence operations, while the SVR focuses on political
intelligence; this is, however, a very high-level view of these operations. The
SVR conducts its affairs by collecting information via public and private means,
with the intended goal of gathering strategic information from organizations and
individuals who in turn influence strategic policy and decision-makers in
targeted countries.
In 2021, Volexity published research outlining a suspected APT29 phishing
operation that targeted non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research
institutions, governments, and international bodies using election fraud-themed
lures purporting to be sent from the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), a government agency. The same day, Microsoft also
published research on wider TTPs used in the same campaign and attributed
the activity to NOBELIUM, the group behind the SolarWinds intrusions. This
campaign targeted sensitive diplomatic and government entities as early as
February 2021. They believe the threat actor used this information to launch

other highly targeted attacks as part of their broader campaign. Additional
research confirmed that a cluster of infrastructure monitored by Insikt Group
under the designation SOLARDEFLECTION since 2021 overlaps with this
previous reporting. Ongoing detections within the Recorded Future Command
and Control security feed assisted in confirming the registration of new
typosquat domains tied to NOBELIUM operations. More notably, we have
confirmed that several newly identified typosquats continue to adopt the
naming conventions or themes that were originally flagged as likely being
associated with NOBELIUM reporting as early as 2020.

Future Platform (Source: Recorded Future)
The Recorded Future Platform automatically detects typosquatted domains;
each newly created domain entity is evaluated for typosquatting-style similarity
to other domains observed by Recorded Future. An example of this is the
SOLARDEFLECTION typosquat displayed in Figure 1, which based on the
domain’s spelling was very likely an attempt by NOBELIUM operators to
emulate the T-Mobile brand. A review of the frequency in which
SOLARDEFLECTION domains were registered over the past two years
confirmed NOBELIUM’s tendency to register domains in cycles, occasionally
taking short hiatuses which at times likely coincided with new open source
reporting attributing several domains to NOBELIUM activity (as depicted within
the Recorded Future timeline below).

Insikt Group proactively detects SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure through an
in-depth understanding of the infrastructure TTPs that the group employs
(detailed further below within the Infrastructure TTPs section). Additionally, the
Command and Control data set enables us to enrich and identify any
SOLARDEFLECTION IPs that we have categorized as “positive C2”. We then
analyze network communications to investigate how the C2 is interacting with
infected machines or how it is being administered by the adversary.
SOLARDEFLECTION C2s can be reviewed from within the Recorded Future
Platform’s Command and Control data set.
