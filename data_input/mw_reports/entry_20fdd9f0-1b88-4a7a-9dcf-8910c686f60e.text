ESET researchers analyze a previously undocumented trojan that is spread via malicious torrents and uses
multiple tricks to squeeze cryptocoins from its victims while staying under the radar
ESET researchers have uncovered a hitherto undocumented malware family that we named KryptoCibule. This
malware is a triple threat in regard to cryptocurrencies. It uses the victim’s resources to mine coins, tries to hijack
transactions by replacing wallet addresses in the clipboard, and exfiltrates cryptocurrency-related files, all while
deploying multiple techniques to avoid detection. KryptoCibule makes extensive use of the Tor network and the
BitTorrent protocol in its communication infrastructure.
The malware, written in C#, also employs some legitimate software. Some, such as Tor and the Transmission
torrent client, are bundled with the installer; others are downloaded at runtime, including Apache httpd and the Buru
SFTP server. An overview of the various components and their interactions is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. KryptoCibule components and tools

When the malware is first executed, the host is assigned a unique identifier with the format {adjective}-{noun} where
{adjective} and {noun} are random words taken from two hardcoded lists which provide over 10 million unique
combinations. This identifier is then used to identify the host in communications with the C&C servers.
On top of the crypto-related components, KryptoCibule also has RAT functionality. Among the commands it
supports are EXEC, which allows execution of arbitrary commands and SHELL, which downloads a PowerShell
script from the C&C. This script then loads a backdoor generated with the post-exploitation tool Pupy.
The name KryptoCibule derives from the Czech and Slovak words for “crypto” and “onion”.

Timeline
We have uncovered multiple versions of this malware, enabling us to trace its evolution all the way back to
December 2018. Figure 2 shows the changes made over time to KryptoCibule.

Figure 2. Timeline of updates and functionality changes

Targets
According to ESET telemetry (shown in Figure 3), the malware seems to target mostly users in Czechia (the Czech
Republic) and Slovakia. This reflects the user base of the site on which the infected torrents are found.

3/15

Figure 3. In our telemetry data, over 85% of detections were located in Czechia and Slovakia

Almost all the malicious torrents were available on uloz.to; a popular (At the time of this writing, this website and its
localized variant (ulozto.cz and ulozto.sk respectively) are both in the Alexa top 50 most visited sites in Czechia and
in the top 75 most visited sites for Slovakia) file sharing site in Czechia and Slovakia (see Figure 4). We’ll explain
how these torrents are used to spread KryptoCibule in the next section.

4/15

Figure 4. One of the malicious torrents on uloz.to

As detailed in the Anti-detection and anti-analysis techniques section below, KryptoCibule specifically checks for
ESET, Avast, and AVG endpoint security products; ESET is headquartered in Slovakia, while the other two are
owned by Avast, which is headquartered in Czechia.

Torrents
KryptoCibule makes use of the BitTorrent protocol to spread to new victims and to download additional tools and
updates.

Initial Compromise
KryptoCibule is spread through malicious torrents for ZIP files whose contents masquerade as installers for cracked
or pirated software and games. Although other files may be included, as seen in Figure 5, there are five that are
common to all KryptoCibule installer archives. packed.001 is the malware, while packed.002 is the installer for the
expected software. Both are XOR-encrypted with keys contained in Setup.exe.
When Setup.exe is executed, it decodes both the malware and the expected installer files. It then launches the
malware – in the background – and the expected installer – front and center – giving the victim no indication that
anything is amiss.

5/15

Figure 5. Content of the Dead.Cells.Incl.All.DLC archive with only the minimum common set of KryptoCibule installer files
shown

Additional software and updates
The BitTorrent protocol is also used to download updates to the malware, and additional software.
KryptoCibule installs the transmission-daemon torrent client and manages it by issuing commands via its RPC
interface on port 9091 with transmission-remote. The RPC interface uses the hardcoded credentials
superman:krypton.
To install further software for the malware’s use, such as the SFTP server, the Launcher component makes an
HTTP GET request to %C&C%/softwareinfo?title=<software name> and receives a JSON response containing a
magnet URI (Magnet links are a type of URI that identify files by using a cryptographic hash of their contents rather
than their location. These links may also include metadata about the file. They are commonly used in the BitTorrent
protocol to identify files to be shared. See https://www.bittorrent.com/blog/2016/01/27/reshaping-the-internet-whatsa-magnet-link/) for the torrent to download and other information indicating how to install and execute the program.
Figure 6 shows an example of such a response.

{"Magnet": "magnet:?xt=urn[:]btih:67yd647nivxhumoedvwnwnzve55b3bxj&dn=free-BuruServer-x64v1.7.3.zip", "Version": 1,"ExecutableRelativePath": "", "ExecutableFileName": "buru.exe","ExecutableArgs":
"run", "InstallFile": "", "HasCustomConfig": true}

Figure 6. Sample response for a GET /softwareinfo?title=ssh_server request

The mechanism for getting updates is similar. The malware first gets global settings via HTTP from
%C&C%/settingsv5. Among other things, this response contains a magnet URI for the latest version of the
malware. It then makes a GET request to %C&C%/version to get the most recent version number. If the local
version is lower than that version, the torrent is downloaded and installed.
Torrents are added to Transmission using the following command:
transmission-remote localhost -n superman:krypton -a “<magnet URI>”
A hardcoded list of 50 trackers (In the BitTorrent protocol, a tracker is a server that helps clients find and coordinate
with peers to transfer files. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker ) is used to get peers for all torrents.

Seeding malicious torrents
Victims are also used to seed (In the BitTorrent protocol, a seed is a peer that has a complete torrent and that lets
others download that torrent’s files from it. See https://help.bittorrent.com/support/solutions/articles/29000023347what-is-seeding- ) both the torrents used by the malware and the malicious torrents that help spread it. Infected
hosts get a list of magnet URIs from %C&C%/magnets, download them all and keep seeding them. This ensures
that these files are widely available for others to download, which helps speed up the downloads and provides
redundancy.

Anti-detection and anti-analysis techniques
6/15

This malware leverages a variety of techniques to avoid detection, along with some basic anti-analysis protections.
It starts with the initial access vector. The executable contained inside the ZIP archive is a rather benign installer
program that masquerades as the legitimate InstallShield program. This file is scrambled with the open source
program Obfuscar. This same tool is used on all of the malware’s custom executables. The malicious code itself is
located inside an XOR-encrypted file, the key being a GUID hardcoded in Setup.exe.
The malware is then installed to the hardcoded path %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Adobe\Acrobat Reader
DC\Reader\update and uses legitimate Adobe Acrobat Reader executable names for the bundled Tor executable
and its own. Some of the files contained in the install folder can be seen in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Some of the files in the install folder. Armsvc.exe is the malware and ADelRCP.exe is the Tor executable. Both
filenames are actually used by Adobe Reader.

To achieve persistence, KryptoCibule creates a scheduled task to be run every five minutes with the following
command. Once again, it uses an Adobe Reader-related name.
schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC MINUTE /MO 5 /TN “Adobe Update Task” /TR
\””%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\Update\armsvc.exe\”” [/RL HIGHEST] /F [/RU
SYSTEM]
Before first executing its payload and on every iteration of the main loop, the malware performs a check for running
analysis software using the following list. If any process with a matching name is found, it stops all running
components and exits.
cain
filemon
netmon
netstat
nmwifi
perfmon
processhacker
procexp
procexp64
procmon
regmon
tasklist
taskmgr
tcpvcon
tcpview
wireshark

Antivirus evasion
Before initializing the cryptominer components, the malware performs a case-insensitive check of the
rootSecurityCenter2\AntiVirusProduct WMI object for the strings avast, avg and eset, as seen in the decompiled
code in Figure 8. Should any of these strings be detected If any of them were detected, the cryptominer
7/15

components will not be installed.

Figure 8. Cleaned up decompiled code of the function used to check for specific security products

Whenever the malware installs itself, an update or a new component, the install path used is excluded from
Windows Defender automatic scanning by issuing the following command:
powershell -c “Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath ‘<install path>'”
It also creates firewall rules using innocuous-looking names to explicitly allow inbound and outbound traffic from its
components. A rule to block outbound traffic from the ESET Kernel Service (ekrn.exe) is also created by the
function shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Function that blocks outbound traffic from ekrn.exe in the Windows Firewall

Tor network usage

8/15

KryptoCibule brings along the tor.exe command line tool, masquerading as ADelRCP.exe, and a configuration file
(seen in Figure 10) as libstringutils.dll.

Figure 10. The Tor configuration file used by the latest version of the malware

This sets up a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 that is used by the malware to relay all communications with the C&C
servers through the Tor network. This has the dual benefit of encrypting the communications and making it virtually
impossible to trace the actual server or servers behind these URIs.
The second part of the configuration file sets up onion services (In Tor, onion services are a way of making a
service running on a certain port only reachable via the Tor network.) on the victimized host. These are accessible
by the operators over the Tor network. When first starting up these services, Tor automatically generates a .onion
URI for the host. This unique hostname is then sent to %C&C%/transferhost/<unique name>. We will discuss how
these onion services are used in the upcoming sections.

MiniWeb HTTP server

The onion URIs for two C&C servers are contained in the malware. One of these provides a REST API that the
malware uses for most communications, while the other is used to download files. Additional URIs can be obtained
one at a time with a request to %C&C%/server. Some older versions of the malware use these to download
updates via port 12461. We believe that these URIs point to other infected hosts. The versions of the malware that
use them have code to place their downloaded updates into a directory served by the MiniWeb HTTP server on that
same port.
We were able to identify one IP address for the file server C&C in our telemetry data.

Acquiring cryptocurrency
KryptoCibule has three components that leverage infected hosts in order to obtain cryptocurrencies.

Cryptomining
The latest versions of KryptoCibule use XMRig, an open source program that mines Monero using the CPU, and
kawpowminer, another open source program that mines Ethereum using the GPU. The second one is only used if a
dedicated GPU is found on the host. Both of these programs are set up to connect to an operator-controlled mining
9/15

server over the Tor proxy.
On every iteration of the main loop, the malware checks the battery level and the time since the last user input. It
then starts or stops the miner processes based on this information. If the host has received no user input in the last
3 minutes and has at least 30% battery, both the GPU and CPU miners are run without limits. Otherwise, the GPU
miner is suspended, and the CPU miner is limited to one thread. If the battery level is under 10%, both miners are
stopped. This is done to reduce the likelihood of being noticed by the victim.

Clipboard hijacking
The second component masquerades as SystemArchitectureTranslation.exe. It uses the
AddClipboardFormatListener function to monitor changes to the clipboard and to apply the replacement rules
obtained from %C&C%/regexes to its content. The code for this listener is shown in Figure 11. The value 0x31D
corresponds to the WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE constant.
These rules, in the form <regular_expresssion>!<wallet>, match the format of cryptocurrency wallet addresses and
replace them with addresses of wallets controlled by the malware operator. This is an attempt to redirect
transactions made by the victim to the operator’s wallets. This component uses a FileSystemWatcher to reload
replacement rules whenever the settings.cfg file is changed.

10/15

At the time of this writing, the wallets used by the clipboard hijacking component had received a little over US$1800
in Bitcoin and Ethereum. One such wallet is shown in Figure 12. By correlating wallets used as sources in the same
transactions as known ones, we were able to uncover at least four additional Bitcoin wallets that likely belong to
KryptoCibule’s operators.

Figure 12. A Bitcoin wallet used by the clipboard-hijacking component

File exfiltration
The third component walks through the filesystem of each available drive and looks for filenames that contain
certain terms. A list of such terms we obtained during our investigation is shown in Figure 13.

"hesla", "seed", "metamask", "antminer", "trezor", "ledger", "private", "trx", "exodus", "password", "jaxx",
"guarda", "atomic.exe", "copay.exe", "Green Address Wallet.exe", "msigna.exe", "ArmoryQT.exe", ".ssh",
".aws", "Desktop"]

Figure 13. A list of words to search for, taken from the GET %C&C%/settingsv5 response

11/15

Most terms refer to cryptocurrencies, wallets or miners, but a few more generic ones like crypto (in several
languages), seed and password are present also. The list contains similar terms in Czech and Slovak such as
heslo, hesla and banka (these are the words for “password”, “passwords” and “bank”, respectively). A few terms
also correspond to paths or files that could provide other interesting data (Desktop, private) including private keys
(.ssh, .aws). It gathers the full path of each of the matching files and sends the list to %C&C%/found/<unique
name>.
We believe that this works in tandem with the SFTP server running as an onion service on port 9187. This server
creates mappings for every available drive and makes them available using credentials hardcoded in the malware.
The gathered paths can thus be used for file exfiltration by having an attacker-controlled machine request them
from the infected host over SFTP.
KryptoCibule also installs a legitimate Apache httpd server that is configured to act as a forward proxy without any
restrictions and that is reachable as an onion service on port 9999.

Conclusion
The KryptoCibule malware has been in the wild since late 2018 and is still active, but it doesn’t seem to have
attracted much attention until now. Its use of legitimate open-source tools along with the wide range of antidetection methods deployed are likely responsible for this. The relatively low number of victims (in the hundreds)
and their being mostly confined to two countries may also contribute to this. New capabilities have regularly been
added to KryptoCibule over its lifetime and it continues to be under active development.
Presumably the malware operators were able to earn more money by stealing wallets and mining cryptocurrencies
than what we found in the wallets used by the clipboard hijacking component. The revenue generated by that
component alone does not seem enough to justify the development effort observed.
