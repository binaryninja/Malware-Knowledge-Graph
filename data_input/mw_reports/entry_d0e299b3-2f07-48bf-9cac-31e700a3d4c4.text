MITRE'S CENTER FOR DATA-DRIVEN POLICY

TRUSTING OUR SUPPLY CHAINS:
A COMPREHENSIVE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH
By Robert A. Martin

For many suppliers providing the Department of
Defense with commercial goods, the concept of
a “cleared industry partner” became part of their
way of life.
At the same time, the computerization of everything
gave rise to pervasive cyber threats – including
those stemming from vulnerabilities inherent in
repurposed software of often dubious provenance.
Further complicating this picture is the increasingly
globalized nature of service support for ICT systems.
Our adversaries seek to inject themselves into every
conceivable stage of technology development, for both
disruptive and intelligence objectives.

Congressional Actions

Trust and trustworthiness of
supply chains is an issue confronting
communities around the world,
including U.S. government agencies
and the thousands of commercial
enterprises that support them.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought supply chain
security (SCS) into sharpened focus, and many
inadequacies have surfaced regarding timely access
to reliable stocks of personal protective equipment,
medical devices, and food supplies, to name a few.
This is not a new challenge. In the 2000s, many
U.S. government practices related to supply chain
logistics management, dating from the Cold War
era, were extended into the broader commercial
information and communications technology
(ICT) marketplace as those technologies and the
efficiencies they brought to business and government
became key enablers of the information economy.

Since 2013, Congress has passed several National
Defense Authorization Acts and laws that contain
more than 100 references to supply chain security.
Many of these still remain to be implemented by
their target agencies. More recently, in 2018, the
executive branch and Congress worked to pass new
legislation to improve executive branch coordination,
supply chain information sharing, and actions to
address supply chain risks. The Federal Acquisition
Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (Title II of Pub.
L. 115-390), signed into law on December 21,
2018, established the Federal Acquisition Security
Council (FASC). The FASC is an executive branch
interagency council, chaired by a senior-level official
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
and includes representatives from the General
Services Administration, Department of Homeland
Security, Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, Department of Justice, Department of
Defense, and Department of Commerce. This new
interagency council, with its multiagency leadership
and broad mandate for both cyber and SCS policy,
could become the much-needed coordinating
mechanism for federal agencies seeking to
answer questions about vendor and product
trustworthiness.

Supply Chain Security System
of Trust (SoT) Framework
MITRE has been engaged for decades supporting
the national and homeland security communities on
supply chain risk issues, and working with national
and international standards organizations. We have
also been deeply engaged in projects specifically
focusing on supply chain security for ICT systems,
including highly sensitive nuclear and intelligence
systems, and the “trustworthiness” of vendors and
products. With today's increased focus on the need
for trustworthy supply chains, trustworthy partners,
and trusted systems globally, a reliable path to an
actionable understanding of the risks that can impact
trustworthiness is essential – and this path must be
understood, shared, and usable at scale.
As a result, we have developed the Supply Chain
Security System of Trust (SoT) Framework. This
framework is aimed at defining, aligning, and
addressing the specific concerns and risks that stand
in the way of organizations' trusting suppliers, supplies,
and service providers. More importantly, the framework
offers a comprehensive, consistent, and repeatable
methodology – for evaluating suppliers, supplies, and
service providers alike – that is based on our decades

of supply chain security experience, deep insights
into the complex challenges facing the procurement
community of interest, and broad knowledge of the
relevant standards organizations.

How it Works
The SoT framework is organized into categories that
include suppliers, supplies, and services. It addresses
12 top-level decisional risk areas associated with
trust that agencies and enterprises must evaluate
and make choices about during the full life cycle of
their acquisition activities. Leveraging the full breadth
and depth of our expertise, industry efforts, and
government research, the SoT framework drills down
into these 12 top-level risk areas, investigating as
many as 76 risk sub-areas by addressing over 400
detailed questions. For example, as highlighted in
Figure 1: Does a supplier make use of a standard
service bill of materials—a list of all the serviceable
parts needed to maintain an asset while it's in
operation? Is the supplier using high assurance
and integrity capabilities to track where software
“supplies/components” came from, who crafted
them, and whether it is verified that they have been
through the expected assurance and validation steps
necessary to address the risk of malicious taint?

In addition, the framework draws upon numerous
validated data repositories to advance a probabilistic
risk assessment of the trustworthiness of a product,
service, or supplier. This SoT analytical system is
positioned to enable an acquirer to make a clear, wellinformed decision about whether to purchase from a
particular entity, and whether to purchase a specific
item/part number from that entity. Figure 1 shows a
high-level depiction of the SoT framework.

How to Apply It
The SoT assessment starts with asking a few scoping
questions to narrow down the SoT content to something
appropriate to the product, service, or supplier in
question. This subset will be aligned to the assessing
organization's assessment focus, resources, available
time, and legal authorities, and to its present acquisition
challenge. During the evaluation process, subjectspecific questions are posed to establish the presence
or absence of individual aspects of concern and to align
with best practices from government and industry. Risks
are scored using a set of contextually driven, tailorable,
weighted measurements that are used as inputs into

a scoring algorithm. The scoring results are then used
to identify supplier strengths and weaknesses against
the applicable risk categories, enabling an acquirer to
analyze and evaluate one or more suppliers' relative
“trustworthiness” for supplying components or services.

Early Pilots Show Promising Results
In late 2020, we conducted an initial set of pilots
that assessed: (1) a set of companies for general
concerns, (2) a specific company as a supplier of
critical infrastructure systems, (3) a product for use by a
specific community within the federal government, and
(4) an industrial base assessment for an organization
dependent upon a specific technology and the industry
capable of supplying it.
The preliminary results for Pilot 1 are illustrated below
in Figure 2, an unweighted bar chart depicting the
overall risk scores for the 11 companies reviewed in
the pilot, and in Figure 3, which presents radar plots of
five data-driven scores from the supplier risk categories
(leveraging 52 questions in those areas) for three of the
11 companies of interest. Figure 4 offers a deeper look

into the risk scores that generated the radar plot for one
of the companies involved in the pilot (Company 10).
These examples all use data sources the SoT leveraged
to generate the analytical assessments, which clearly
show a larger risk profile for Company 10 compared to
the others. This pilot provided a proof of concept that
offers early evidence of this tool's utility, with deeper and
broader analysis to follow as the SoT is completed. The
other three pilots had similar insights.
In the next phase of the SoT effort, we will use the full
array of data sources envisioned and tailor weighting and
score contributions to fine-tune the emphasis on specific
sub-risk areas used in any given assessment. Although
the pilots only used a subset of the public, private, and
restricted access data sources the SoT is anticipated to
leverage, we are cataloging and capturing the numerous
sources of potential utility in conducting such analyses.

Next Steps and Recommended Actions
Continued tuning of the Supply Chain Security SoT
Framework through additional pilots and real-world
application is expected to result in enhancements that
will position the SoT framework to become the generally
accepted framework for supply chain security – similar
to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
used in all U.S. businesses, or the globally equivalent
international financial reporting standards (IFRS).
There are a number of actions that agencies, the newly
organized FASC, Congress, and industry can take now:
 Agencies should explore the application of
this framework to their supply chain risks. This
participation would also enhance the framework.
In addition, data sharing of the results of these
assessments between federal agencies should
be explored to strengthen the management of
government-wide risks to our nation's supply chain.

 The FASC, working under the direction of OMB,
should actively examine the use of a comprehensive
framework like the Supply Chain Security SoT
Framework to improve agencies' supply chain
risk management, and move towards adopting
a consistent, repeatable, data-driven analytical
approach for addressing supply chain concerns.
 Congress, both in its oversight role and in the
context of future legislation associated with
execution of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain
Security Act of 2018, should consider the potential
benefits of having the FASC utilize a comprehensive
approach like the Supply Chain Security SoT
Framework.
 Industry should support and contribute to the
continued legislative and executive branch efforts
to better understand and secure our nation's supply
chains. Such actions will encourage companies to
be conscious of their trust rating if they want to do
business with the federal government and to take
steps to ensure they're securing their supply chain
systems.
