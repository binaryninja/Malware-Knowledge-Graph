Timeline of the report updates
April 29, 2016, brief report and sample analysis report were drafted.
May 12, 2016, comprehensive analysis report was completed.
June 20, 2016, the public version of the report was updated.

1. Overview
Operation Sphinx is a cyber-espionage activity in the Middle East. The main victims are political
and military organizations in Egypt, Israel and possibly other countries. Sensitive data theft is
what the attackers plotted for during the period from June, 2014 to November, 2015 when the
activity was in its prime. We encountered some timestamps of the samples to be as early as
December, 2011 which suggests the attack might be started much earlier, though further sound
proof is needed. The main approach of Sphinx is watering hole attack on social websites. Until
now, we have obtained 314 pieces of sample malicious codes and 7 C2 domains.
A common method attackers use to hide their trace is to cloak malicious exe files with Word or
PDF icons so that users will not tell the difference without looking into the file attribution or
property. The Sphinx attackers adopt it as well, but they also attempt to conceal the attacks by
making the master program “invisible”. In our analysis, Sphinx’ master program was found to be
disguised with Word icon in order to trap users to click. Upon clicking, the master program
released several DLL files. The files can be categorized into 9 types of plugin modules by
functionality. The core DLL fill could be self-started after registering as a plugin of the resource
management panel. Then, based on different configurations, remote injection was triggered to
inject other functional DLL to corresponding running process. This way, when the malware was
running, the master program had already been split into several imperceptible pieces. That
decreases the risk for the targets to realize the existence of the malware. Multiple encryption
algorithms were adopted simultaneously to hamper the detection.
Seeing from the PDB paths, we suspect that the attackers were using continuous integration tools,
which indicts that the scale of operation may massive and the developers of the malware are
professionals in relevant fields. Furthermore, we speculate that some third party organizations
were involved in helping develop the malware to support the Middle East’s attackers.

2. Payload Delivery
1) Watering Holes on Social Websites
One of the lure documents was found in the comments area on Israeli Army’s Facebook. It shows
the attackers took advantage of this social websites to deliver the payload because their targets
often visit it. This is the watering hole that has been seen as compromise vector in many
cyber-attacks. Traditionally, watering holes attacks can be categorized into two types by
approach:
a. Attackers will usually study and capture the website that their targets often visit. Then
malware code (usually the scripts exploit some vulnerability) is directly embedded on the
site. Now, the site is infected with Trojan and the trap is ready for victims. When the
targets visit the site and click infected pages, the malware will be implanted in their
computer if the network environment matches attackers preset conditions.
b. Attackers will capture a website and replace certain application or link on it with
malicious download link. Once target visits the site and download the file in the link,
malware will be implanted in the victim’s computer. Typical cases are the Havex Trojan1
(also known as Dragonfly or Energetic Bear) unrevealed in 2014 and OceanLotus in late
May, 20152.
The commonness the two approaches share is attackers need to obtain the authorization to
modify the website they aim to capture. However, in Sphinx attacks, it is much easier to get
authorized to deploy the watering holes because they just need to simply register a Facebook
account. That is all they need to be free to scatter malicious links in the comments’ area. It is a
new approach in setting up watering holes in APT attacks.

Lure documents in the RAR file are about the amendment on individual income tax regulations.
The original exe icon has been replaced with a PDF or Word icon to induce targets to click.

Picture 2 Lure documents in RAR file folder
With in-depth analysis, we found that 10 social website accounts in total were compromised in
the attacks, including Israeli Army, Israeli Navy and other accounts related with Israeli military
and government. Malicious comments are intense from late January to early February in 2015.
The content containing a malicious link are mostly about the aforementioned adjustments of
individual income tax.
*Please review Appendix A for a whole list of the sites.

2) Lure Documents
There are two types lure documents and the contents can tell APT researchers what fields and
geos the attackers were targeting.
(A) Egypt - Arabic

Picture 4 Lure documents – 1

In the original lure document3, the YouTube video links showing the arrests of students from
Al-Azhar University that against the coup are included at the end of the file.

The name “annonymous rabaa” on the picture is an Egyptian hacker group that compromise
government official sites to protest the slaughter in August, 2013.
(B) Israel - Hebrew

Picture 6 Lure document – 3

This document quotes the adjustments of Israeli individual income tax.

3) Self-camouflage
The malware either cloak itself with documentation and image icon, or with application icon. The
picture below shows a fake Adobe Flash installer file.

Picture 7 Impersonation of a document

Picture 8 Impersonation of an Adobe Flash application

With the former approach, no document or image will pop-up upon clicking; while with the latter
approach, the legitimate installer file will be released after the malware finishes its installation.
The 9 plugin modules are disguised as Office components. In earlier version of the malware, the
installation directory is %UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\officeplugin. But later versions
changed the path to be under C:\Program Files\{GUID}, for instance, C:\Program
Files\{59f0641e-45ac-11e5-af9e-b8ca3af5855f} is a piece of malware that pretends to be a
system component.

3. Malware Analysis - ROCK
1) Functionality Brief
ROCK Trojan plays a main role in the Sphinx attacks. This malware family was developed by the
attackers themselves or was customer-made by a third party group. We also found a variant of
the njRAT family in another sample which we will introduce in another chapter.
The malware impersonated Word documents, images or installation programs in the attempt to
disguise itself as PDF files, pictures or Flash installers to induce the users to click.
The main purpose is to steal sensitive information from the victims, such as system information,
account & password and search history saved in the browser. It also monitors victims through
Skype chatting history, cameras, microphones and keyboard & mouse logging. The information
collected will then be encrypted and passed back to specific C2 servers.

2) Infrastructure

Picture 10 Infrastructure of the malware

Configuration data of all the modules is saved in JSON configuration file. The file decides, to name
a few, whether to run the module or not, what encryption key to use on the data files, what
pixels and intervals of the screenshots and audio recordings are required, as well we what
running process the master program should be injected in. It also provides the user ID (rkuid),
due date, C2 address, etc.

Picture 11 Modules and Functionalities

The dropper releases 20 DLL files in total with ten 32-bit and ten 64-bit. Each module is
composed of two versions to be compliant with 32-bit and 64-bit system.
Module name

Functionality

zcore

Master program

zulib

API function encapsulation

plgcmd

Obtain system info, screenshots, startup/end progress

plgcomm

Communication

plginput

Mouse and keyboard logging

plgurl

Monitor the content in web browser’s (IE, FireFox, Chrome) address bar

plgskype

Save and pass back Skype chatting history, screenshots and audio records

plgavbug

Monitor through camera and microphone, send back the records

plgusrstl

Steal user information, including account name & password, search history,
cookies, Pidgin (IM software) account

plgfsflt

Monitor and pass back data of specific file types like doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx,
odf, txt, pdf, rtf, jpg, jpeg, gif, png

When the master program Zcore is started, it decrypts the configuration file under installation
directory and decides whether to inject into certain process according to the module status
(true/false) in the configuration file.
Function modules:
 Zcore.dll core module: mainly responsible for loading other function modules and
injecting them to certain process; register, update and uninstall modules, distribute logs
and messages
 Plgcmd.dll command module: obtain system information, delete file and directory, take
screenshots, upload saved documents, start and end process.
 Plgcomm.dll communication module: transfer data generated and encrypted by other
modules to specific C2 server. The module sends a request to the server per minute to

acquire remote commands.
The cross-process communication between each module is completed via WM_COPYDATA
messages. Every message begins with 0x34AB541 which is the unique identification. The body of
the message is transferred in JSON codes.

3) C2 Communication
The message is transferred in data package to server port 80 through HTTP POST. Sensitive strings
in the package are replaced after querying the mapping table of JSON configuration file.

Picture 1 C2 Communication

Picture 13 Restored Strings of C2 Communication

C2 communication modules is injected into the browser process and the port used to send data
to C2 server is port 80, these two methods perfectly cloak the attack among the normal traffic.

4) Attack Techniques
Random file names
The module files are re-named randomly after being released by the Dropper and the names are
stored in the JSON file (usually nouns in English, for instance, gendarme.dll, jerques.dll).

Picture 14 File name of the modules

String Encryption
All the strings are encrypted by several encryption algorithms.

Picture 15 String Encryption

API function encapsulation
A great amount of API functions (over 300) are encapsulated in zulib (a dynamic dll library) to
hamper static analysis from security software.

Runtime without master program
The core module is started up as an extension of explorer.exe. Other modules are injected into
certain processes according to the configuration file. Therefore, there is no master program
running during the malware runtime which makes the malicious activities hard to be noticed.
Even though sometimes users may sense the abnormity, they would still relax their vigilance at
last with checking attempt ending up in vain.
Process injection
The master module runs in a legitimate explorer which security software will not intercept.
Communication module is usually injected into the browser process. But if there is no browser
process, the malware will give up communicating with C2 server. The data theft module is
injected into security software so as to make the malware’s trace inconspicuous when it traverses
files.
PE and config file encryption
PE files in the dropper are compressed by zlib and encrypted by AES algorithms, as well as the
configuration files released by the dropper.
No matter on dynamic or static combat, the attack tactics indicts that these malware developers
must have spent time and efforts studying security software to compile customer-made malware
so as to avoid detection and cover its trace.
