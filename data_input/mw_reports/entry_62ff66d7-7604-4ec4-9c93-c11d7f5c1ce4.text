EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Researchers from the combined labs of NortonLifeLock and AVIRA have uncovered
several clusters of malicious activity against the Holy See and the Roman Catholic
Church.
The activity appears to date back several years—long before what has been previously
documented—but with several new initiatives launched recently.
We assess with high confidence that the threat actors are aligned with Chinese strategic
interests and may encompass one or multiple groups. Likewise, we assess with high
confidence that the goal of the activity is surveillance, as the Catholic Church has been
diplomatically active in countries that are of special interest for the Chinese government.

INTRODUCTION
During 2020, several researchers and security vendors reported on targeted malware
used against the Roman Catholic Church. [1] [2] [3] [4]. These revolved around a few
known toolsets commonly associated with Chinese threat actors, notably the PlugX
malware, but also covered some previously undocumented malware families.
The Catholic Church has historically had a turbulent relationship with Chinese
authorities, where it was demanded that the Church could only operate within the strict
guidelines of the Communist Party.
In recent years, Pope Francis has had a strong focus on the Catholic Church in Asia,
with numerous visits of countries in the region. At the same time, the Vatican has
worked to improve affairs with the Chinese government. Since 2014, diplomatic talks
have been held over the thorny subject of appointment of bishops [5] [6], and finally in
2018 the Vatican reached a provisional agreement with the Chinese government [7].
The deal was renewed for an additional two years in 2020.
Considerable criticism has been raised against the deal, citing concerns over the human
rights situation in China and the crackdown on religious communities. [8]
This is the political context for the malware campaigns we will be detailing in this paper.

CHAPTER 1:
THE LINKIPV6 PLUGX/POISONIVY CAMPAIGN (2014-2016)
Patient Zero
On February 10, 2021, Norton antimalware technology detected the presence of a
malicious DLL on a user machine in France. This turned out to be a PlugX malware.
PlugX
PlugX is a well-known Chinese trojan used by a whole host of threat actors. It is usually
distributed as a package of several files. These files are composed to exploit a
phenomenon called DLL search order hijacking (also called sideloading) [9].
One of the files in the bundle will be a legitimate program from a trusted software
vendor. When this program is run, it attempts to load a Dynamic Link Library (DLL),
which is a software component belonging to its own installation. The program will find a
malicious DLL with the same name, inadvertently loading that instead. The malware
thus gets the unwitting help of a trusted executable to run. The malicious DLL then
typically loads an encrypted file from disk which contains the final payload.
There are many sideloader configurations used by malware (more than 60 that we’ve
seen), and a lot of major software products by trusted vendors have historically been
misused this way. Most of these issues were fixed a long time ago, but old executables
still work and are still exploited by threat actors.
Sample found on user computer:
sha256: 6b851e5b7d429f56a3fd7453314afc4b8c96cb3a702609cfba2545b0bbe15828
This is a standard PlugX loader named vsodscpl.dll, designed to be loaded by a legitimate
scncgf32.exe from the McAfee VirusScan suite. We do not have the payload blob (named
mcafee.lib) in this case. However, there is a complete dropper on VirusTotal (VT) for this exact
loader [10]. This dropper is configured to use the following Command & Control (C2) addresses:
sg3appstore[.]net
us3appstore[.]net
bz3appstore[.]info
maildantri[.]org
While we cannot be certain that the VT dropper was the one used in our case, there is good
reason to believe the samples are related: Two of the C2 domains above are also used in
PoisonIvy campaigns we will detail later. These overlap with Vatican-oriented activity.

3

In addition to that sample, we saw IPS events from the machine showing that it was reaching
out to the following domain:
link.linkipv6[.]com
Data from VirusTotal showed that this C2 is connected to a large cluster of PlugX and PoisonIvy
activity, apparently targeting the Catholic Church and its activities in Asia. This cluster is much
older than previously reported Catholic-related targeting. Most of the samples were submitted
to VT in 2016. However, the malicious loader DLL has a compilation timestamp from December
2013, and the various lures appear to be mainly from 2014. More than 100 malware samples
were found to belong to this cluster. They tend to follow the same two basic designs as shown
below, with just the lure documents differing between samples.

4
© Copyright 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved. |. OPERATION EXORCIST | 18/10/2021

Left: The dropper is a PE executable
which is named according to some
church-related topic (in Italian.)
It extracts another executable called
wintmp01.exe to disk. In addition, a real
document is opened to stop the user
from becoming suspicious.
Wintmp01.exe is a WinRAR SFX archive
containing four files:
Hewlett.exe is a renamed legitimate
hpqtax08.exe from Hewlett-Packard. It
loads the malicious hpqtap08.dll, which
in turn loads the first of two binary
shellcode blobs - msi.url. This contains
an intermediate executable written in
Delphi, which depending on the
situation attempts to load the final
shellcode blob hp.url either directly or
through thread injection mechanisms.
Once decoded, hp.url contains a classic
early PlugX executable.

Right: The dropper is a PE executable
similar to the left case.
It extracts another executable called
dc006.exe to disk. In addition, a real
document is opened to stop the user from
becoming suspicious. Dc006.exe is a Delphi
executable containing an encoded exe
resource which is run in memory. This
resource again extracts three files:
Commfunc.exe is a renamed legitimate
cammute.exe from Lenovo. It loads the
malicious commfunc.dll, which in turn
loads a binary shellcode blob
commfunc.dat.
This contains a loader executable written in
Delphi, which contains and calls an
embedded SHELLCODE resource,
containing Poison Ivy.
The loader uses the internal name
FerryTrojan. In theory it can be used to
load any type of shellcode.

PoisonIvy
PoisonIvy (PI) was originally a “remote administration tool” developed by the Swedish
hacker Shapeless in 2005, with several other contributors [11]. It was freely available on
the web and was quickly adopted by many threat actors because of its features. It is
lightweight and supports being deployed as a small executable shellcode. PI injectors
also sometimes use sideloading.
Targeting
We have little hard data on the actual targets for this campaign, but we can make highconfidence conclusions based on the topics and design of the lure documents.
Many lures follow a format that seems to adhere to the internal Vatican document
standard:

Above: Naming convention follows the scheme SEQUENCE_NUMBER/YEAR/ DEPARTMENT.
In our case, the ‘Department’ field is ‘RS’ (Rapporti con gli Stati - Relations with States). This is
a report on anniversary celebrations for Pope Francis in Singapore.

Correspondence possibly directed at external recipients:

Above: Notice of Papal Audience given to then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra of Thailand.
The meeting indeed took place on Sept. 12th, 2013 [12]

6
© Copyright 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved. |. OPERATION EXORCIST | 18/10/2021

News reports taken from public sources:

Above: A news story seemingly taken from AsiaNews [13]

Many of these lures seem to be either stolen legitimate documents, or documents
deliberately doctored to resemble official Vatican correspondence.
As mentioned, it is not evident which individuals were targeted by these malware
packages.
There is a strong focus on the Church's activities pertaining to countries in the SouthEast Asia region: Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, East Timor, and Singapore.
However, since most of these lures are in Italian and often follow an apparent internal
Vatican communication format, it is reasonable to assume that the recipients are Italianspeaking representatives of the Holy See.
A full document list is provided in the Appendix.

Connections to other activity
The wintmp01 PlugX and dc006 PoisonIvy droppers have a long history. There are
several separate branches going back to at least 2014 mainly targeting Vietnam. These
seem to be more focused on internal Vietnamese issues, and not specifically on
religious matters or the Vatican. In the case of PoisonIvy, the malware configuration
usually contains a campaign tag that gives a hint as to which cluster they belong to.

Above: Similarity between the usb0712 Vietnamese campaign and the FDSTG Vatican
campaign. Note the *appstore[.]net domains, also used in the previously mentioned PlugX
dropper [10].

The FerryTrojan loader used in some of the Vatican PoisonIvy samples is a common
factor among several other clusters of activity. The same is the case for the network
infrastructure used.

1

Vatican and Vietnamese PlugX and PoisonIvy campaigns are almost identical in
structure.

2

Vatican PlugX activity using the C2 linkipv6[.]com overlaps on IP with Mongolian
PlugX activity at lookipv6[.]com [14] [15].

3

The breach of the Vietnamese travel agency JTB and subsequent user data leak
was reportedly done using FerryTrojan PlugX over the C2’s vietnanmonline[.]com
and vatgla[.]com. [16]

4

FerryTrojan PoisonIvy samples were used in a campaign against Philippines Air
Force.
There are 100+ associated samples that reach out to the associated C2 [17],
complete with lure documents.

5

The cdncool[.]com domain is used for both FerryTrojan PoisonIvy, as well as
PlugX, Farseer and Henbox. [18] [19] [20]

CHAPTER 2:
THE VATICAN INTRUSIONS (2019-2020)
Throughout 2019, Norton researchers detected abnormal activity in telemetry data
originating from computers located in the Vatican. Closer inspection of the logs revealed
that a handful of computers had several clearly malicious implants installed. Some of
these belonged to previously known families such as PlugX while others had not been
publicly documented before.
A total of 17 computers showed signs of intrusion to varying degrees. In this paper, we
will be referring to these as machines A to Q.

This activity revolves around a main command and control hub located at the IP
addresses 192.225.226[.]123 and 192.225.226[.]217. Over time, these addresses have
been used to control malware installations spread over at least four different families.

11
© Copyright 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved. |. OPERATION EXORCIST | 18/10/2021

The other computers we identified contained these and a few malware families to
different degrees.

12
© Copyright 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved. |. OPERATION EXORCIST | 18/10/2021

PLUGX
The PlugX installers in this case have been of different types, which suggests that the
attackers have an arsenal of different malware builders at their disposal.
Sample:
sha256: f96adc9e046ecc6f22d3ba9cfea47a4af75bcba369f454b7a9c8d7ca3d423ac4
This is a bundled installer executable which contains the legitimate application
ptwatchdog.exe renamed to msvsct.exe, a malicious TmDbgLog.dll and an encrypted
PlugX executable payload named TmDbgLog.dll.obj. The installer extracts and
executes a Visual Basic script (msvvcs.vbs) which in turn extracts the other
components.
The PlugX payload is decoded by XOR’ing each byte with 0xbb and subtracting 1.

Command-and-control (C2) servers are 192.225.226[.]123 and 192.225.226[.]217.
Several other PlugX loader DLLs were seen on the affected computers, though without
the original dropper and payload. Without these we cannot be certain about the
specifics of the malware. Some of the DLLs have instead shown up in full dropper
packages on VirusTotal and while these have not necessarily been used against
Vatican targets, it is likely that there is some connection between them. For example:
Loader sha256:
ad48650c6ab73e2f94b706e28a1b17b2ff1af1864380edc79642df3a47e579bb
Dropper sha256:
0a00204517283c9a8d1e2d1a8743249c14de0edcec4a8292500083437735663c
Dropper sha256:
75f2e752983a9f46082e7b35820f23db577a5aff9ad946b05b0d3871a9df686b
These are very similar to the dropper above, though they are WinRAR self-extracting
executables (SFX), not bundled installers.
C2 servers are:
lib.hostareas[.]com and 123.1.151[.]64
web.miscrosaft[.]com and 154.213.21[.]207

Loader sha256:
29b5ffcda77acf5d1d14f8e1e57d2bed803dd493863377fdf48b3ca97126bdde
This is an impersonation of HPCustPartUI.dll from Hewlett-Packard. It uses a different
loader logic from the previous configuration (no VBS script and payload is encoded
using the assembly instructions [sub 0x71, xor 0xb5, add 0x71]). The payload is named
HPCustPartic.UI.
Several droppers are available that incorporate this loader:
Dropper sha256:
3f46de9df24fd146d75c906663e8f1ace300b147f0cea0370f38cb0088a158a4
Dropper sha256:
6537fcbb157bde7acabc3a1a8bef266d7825573ed5ecee1408c495db3c913c60
Dropper sha256:
ade0514ccb90c39a61ab8a4c16818fbcd352984e2a26b2ffcd92165975e07fd5
All of these are configured to use 192.225.226[.]217 and/or 192.225.226[.]123 as C2
servers.
Loader sha256:
653fe0ab7b634e50ba09f962c6357bcf76ce633768aa41dd01d1a93ef83a0a54
This is an impersonation of comserv.dll from Rising Information Technology.
The dropper also contains the legitimate executable RStray.exe as well as the payload
comserv.dll.url. The payload is not decoded before being called, but the code is
obfuscated.
Dropper sha256:
8c16116b95b94511c3dfe5aa1fdb05078a88747bbd2ef9ebe305f90f1bbf604a
C2 server: 192.225.226[.]152

ZUPDAX
This remote access trojan has been in use since at least early 2014, but it has managed
to stay under the radar of the security community, apart from a brief mention in two
reports. [18] [20]
The malware has evolved over time, as has the functionality it offers. The version used
in our case is apparently the same as described by the Korean security vendor Hauri in
Hauri Security Magazine [21] in 2018. Like PlugX, this malware often uses DLL
sideloading as a part of the infection process.
The Zupdax “P1Rat” installer
The initial dropper is a bundled installer we have called the “P1Rat” variant due to the
installer and included loader DLL containing the following debug paths:
D:\Leee\515远程文件\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\src\MyLoaderBypassNorton\Release\loaderexe.pdb
D:\Leee\515远程文件\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\src\MyLoader_bypassKIS\snake\res\SiteAdv.pdb

The following files exist as resources in the installer:
Resource #
103
105
106
107

Installed filename Description
siteadv.exe
Legitimate and signed Mcafee Siteadvisor
Executable
siteadv.dll
Malicious loader DLL
ok.obj
RC4-encrypted payload (key: ”GoogleMailData”)
n/a
Configuration data XOR 0x64

Resources 103, 105 and 106 are extracted to disk using the above names, and
siteadv.exe is executed. This causes the malicious sideadv.dll to be loaded.
Sideadv.dll contain its own copy of the configuration resource. The config data contains:
• Names of executables
• Installation path
• Name of the encrypted payload
• Main payload export function to call
• Whether payload will be loaded from disk or memory
• Registry install key
• Installation check mutex name

15
© Copyright 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved. |. OPERATION EXORCIST | 18/10/2021

Siteadv.dll will be loaded with one of four possible parameters:
Install
Run
Mrun
Install_and_del

Install loader exe in registry run key and load payload
(from file or memory)
Load a decrypted payload dll file from disk and call its
export function. Name of dll and export is defined in
config resource
Decrypt and load payload dll file to memory and call its
export function. Name of dll and export is defined in
config resource
Install loader exe in registry run key and load payload
from memory, as well as delete a file (typically the
installer)

The “Boar” and “Badger” installers
Zupdax has previously been distributed in other installers going by the names “Boar”
and “Badger”. As far as we know, these have not been used in the Vatican campaign(s),
but we mention them here for completeness.
“Boar” executables have contained the following debug paths:
d:\tenshine\The Boar\bin\install.pdb
d:\tenshine\The Boar\bin\ushata.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\install.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\ushata.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\byebye.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\SvcDll.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\install_test.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\ushata_noload.pdb
e:\workspace\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\bin\test.pdb
Instead of containing payload components as resources, Boar incorporates these as
encoded and compressed blobs in the installer file. These are extracted and installed
according to information in an INI file. Where “P1Rat” spoofs siteadv.dll for sideloading,
“Boar” spoofs ushata.dll, a Kaspersky component. The malicious DLL is inadvertently
loaded by the signed legitimate Kaspersky executable avpui.exe which is also included
in the installer.
The “Badger” installer is structurally similar to the “P1Rat” installer, down to the using
the same resource structure and the same RC4 password for the payload decryption.
The PDB string is:
c:\Users\PC-2015\Desktop\Badger\En-v2\免杀\MyLoader_bypassKIS\bin\loaderdll.pdb
16

The malware associated with this installer is a trojanized Able Desktop installation. This
sample was previously detailed by ESET [26], described as dropping PlugX aka
Korplug. The payload does however appear to be Zupdax. The campaign in that case
was seemingly aimed at Mongolian targets and was attributed to LuckyMouse aka
Emissary Panda/APT27 or alternatively a threat actor known as TA428.
Zupdax main payload
The payload is a PE DLL executable of approximately 300kb, written in C++. It exports
one function named load.
The malware utilizes the open-source library UDT for network communication. UDT is
described as a “UDP based application-level data transport protocol for distributed data
intensive applications over wide area high-speed networks.” [22]
The malware will in some configurations try to disguise this as legitimate traffic by
connecting to port 53 (DNS) on the command & control server, as well as deliberately
naming the C2 domains with the ns* (nameserver) prefix. Data transferred is encrypted
using RC4 with the encryption key “Microsoft”.
Zupdax has historical connections to several other targeted operations which will be
briefly covered below.
The variant used in the Vatican campaign supports the following commands:
Command
0x0
0x17
0x19
0x29
0x38
0x68

Action
Stop all actions and deinstall service
Save data to file
Deinstall service
Verify received plugin and call its export function “Fu**ME”. (Export name
is a profanity slightly redacted. It is case insensitive, any case combination
is loaded)
Download and execute file
Start program named AVANTI.EXE (this is usually the loader executable)

NEWBOUNCE
This malware is a backdoor that also includes rootkit components.
The name “NewBounce” is derived from the PDB path included in several
samples:
f:\sj\newbounce\hidefile\amd64\mhide64.pdb
F:\sj\newbounce\Release\setup3.pdb

The string “bounce” is also present as debug messages found in the code; such
as “Run bounce” and “work bounce Mode ”
Installer sha256:
5e3d5f7d04ed48f27652f21d72c5915be147d0dd5bf0e92f1c26b38d5f4e1d7a
This is a simple installer that checks system architecture (x32/x64) and installs the
correct service DLL accordingly. The DLLs are copied from existing files present on disk
named MSVC3.DAT and MSVC6.DAT.
Service DLL:
The service DLL contains the main functionality of the malware. It contains the following
features:
• It can connect to up to three different download servers (optionally via proxy) and
download a shellcode blob embedded in a JPG file. The file will be named
“out.jpg” on disk.
The last four bytes of the JPG indicate the offset in the file where the code blob
starts. This code is LZ-compressed and is read into memory and decompressed
before being called.
• Upon installation it collects basic descriptive data about the target computer,
such as Windows version, computer name, system language and ansi code
page, drive types and free disk space, username, memory status, CPU type and
RDP port and uploads these to C2 server.
• The malware sets up AES-encrypted command&control communications using
the key phrase:
“GAEncryptfasdfafhhIlove!!@#$!@$!@$#%!asdfasdfasdfsdfaasdfaasdfasfsafasdf
asdfdasfdasfjjjvzcxvjzjdfasdfasdfsadfasfsdafdasfasdfasfd”
•

The message handling loop responds to commands from operator. Features
include uploading and downloading of files, opening a command shell, listing files
and processes, copying and deleting files.

18

The DLL is installed in the %system% folder using names like twain.dll or bingsvc.dll,
and registry entries are added to load it:
Registry\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\twain
Sample: File hider rootkit component
sha256 96c0a4bde1d8fedd58215f91d3aaa49e65fb44275ecb15302ebabfc02350c47b
When first executed, NewBounce installs a rootkit minifilter driver and calls this to hide
files related to the malware. This rootkit driver is installed in the drivers folder using the
file name “hfile_device.sys”. The driver subscribes to IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL
events (0xC) via a postprocessing callback and checks the file name returned against
its own list of file names. If the name is found in the list, the directory entry is ignored
and thus never appears in ordinary directory/folder listings.
Userland applications interacting with this rootkit can add new file name strings to the
hidden files list by calling the driver through DeviceIoControl with IOControlCode
0x22E024. Sending the string “CLEAR ALL” instead of a filename will empty the list.
The file is digitally signed using a code certificate issued to 上海域联软件技术有限公司 – or
Shanghai Yulian Software Technology Co., Ltd. This certificate is almost certainly
shared in the underground. A large amount of different malware is signed with it and it
has been used in multiple cyberattacks [23] [24]. It was originally valid only until 2012
and has also been revoked.
This file hider rootkit is identical between the different NewBounce samples we have
seen in the Vatican case.
Interestingly, the service also tries to invoke two other rootkit drivers to hide registry
entries and network connections. These drivers are called PCI358129.SYS and
NSIP.SYS, but they are not dropped by any of the malware samples in the Vatican
intrusion. Without the drivers installed, the calls to them will simply fail.
However, we found an earlier NewBounce sample which does drop drivers matching
the descriptions. They have similar names, PDB paths and are signed with the same
certificate as the file hider, but at least the registry hider does not appear to be fully
finished.

An IP address associated with a NewBounce C2 can be found in 2019 training materials
from a Chinese security group. This article discusses how to use Cobalt Strike.

There could be several possible explanations for this – e.g. re-use of the IP – but it is
interesting.

KOGINA
This is a credential stealer with a loader component.
The name “Kogina” is derived from the PDB path included in some samples:
D:\gina\x64\Loader.pdb
Z:\c\ok\gina\x64\Loader.pdb

The loader injects a shellcode to the Windows Service Host process svchost.exe. The
embedded shellcode is responsible for dropping the payload and establishing
persistence on the system.
• Injects code to svchost
•
•
•

Drops payload to system32 directory
Establishes persistence by installing as a SSP DLL in
"HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages"
The payload is an unencrypted DLL inside of the shellcode.

Payload:
The payload DLL contains the main credential stealer with the capability to send the
username and password to the C&C server. It is installed as a password filter DLL.
We have seen two hardcoded names for the payload:
kavsrvc.dll
wmvdmooe3.dll

Depending on the included configuration the stolen credentials can be saved to a file on disk,
transmitted to C2 via UDP over port 53, or they can be sent via HTTP POST.
Our samples connect over HTTP to hxxp://mail.chin-coj[.]com/mskmsonemissio.php.
Usernames and passwords are encrypted and base64 encoded and concatenated with "flag="
eg. "flag=base64encode(encrypt(username[password]))".

SERVER007
This is a backdoor written in C++. It appears to have been in development at
deployment time because it contains a lot of debug statements. We have seen both 32and 64-bit versions, but only the installed DLL – we do not have copies of the dropper.
This malware has been one of the most commonly found on targeted machines (11/17).
It is installed as a service in the Windows System folder, and when run, it sets up
communication with C2 server over HTTP. Network traffic is LZ-compressed and
base64 encoded.
The malware profiles the local system and uploads the data to C2. This includes:
• Local hostname/ip
• Computer name
• System language ID
• System ANSI code page
• Windows Version (Major and Minor Versions, Build number, Platform ID)
• Drive types
• Free disk space
• Default RDP port
It then sets up a command loop that can:
• run local shells
• list files/folders
• delete files
• rename files
• upload and download files
• execute local commands
The name Server_007 stems from a string present in many samples which appears to
be a campaign tag or similar. This string is also included in the data sent back to C2 but
is otherwise not used. The most prevalent such tag is “server_007” and is probably the
default value. Two samples contain the tag “ppoomm” here, which is similar to
www.ppoomm[.]va, the website of “Pontificie Opere Missionarie” aka the Pontifical
Mission Societies. We do not have individual target information apart from affected
computers being geographically located in the Vatican, so we do not know if this is
meaningful.

SPARKLE
Sparkle is another malware that has been in development for quite some time.
Variations go back to at early 2015. This malware was briefly mentioned and given the
name Sparkle in a 2019 article by BlackBerry Cylance Threatvector Team [25]. We saw
Sparkle used on three computers (A, B, P) in our cluster.
It is typically installed as a DLL by an executable dropper. The dropper is responsible
for extracting the DLL from an LZ-compressed blob and execute it via rundll32.exe. It
will add a registry run key for persistence.
HCKU\Software\ts\explorer\run Adobe =
%SYSTEM%\rundll32.exe %TEMP%\Adobe_FlashUpdate.dll Start
Alternatively, a shortcut file - “Internet Explorer.lnk” - with the same function may be
placed in the %STARTUP% folder.
Once installed, the main payload connects back to C2 server and sets up
communication. Early variants use regular unencrypted (but LZ-compressed) TCP traffic
for this, while newer variants send this information over HTTP.
There is some variation between versions, but usually the features include:
• List system drives
• List files
• Delete files
• Execute CMD statements
• Copy & move files
• Upload files to a remote server
• Download files from a remote server
As with several other malwares in this investigation, some Sparkle samples also contain
noteworthy PDB strings:
F:\六道\Obiit-IV\Release\svchost_1.pdb
F:\六道\Obiit-III\Release\Install_New.pdb
F:\六道\Obiit-IV\Release\Install_New.pdb
E:\六道\HTTP探针远程取证软件\Release\Install_New.pdb
C:\Users\123\Desktop\Obiit-YY\Obiit-III-2.000\Release\Install_New.pdb
C:\Users\Bala\Desktop\Obiit-III\Release\Install_New.pdb
F:\666666\Obiit-III-SD\Release\Install_New.pdb

Based on the PDB strings, the project seems to have been named “Obiit” – or
alternatively “六道“ – “six ways”, possibly referring to the six stages of Buddhist
existence.

GRAVY INJECTOR
This is a simple injector that starts nslookup.exe and loads a malicious DLL into the
nslookup process. We do not have a copy of this payload DLL, but it is named
“MsPEng.dll” on disk.
The injector’s PDB string gives a hint at what the functionality is supposed to be:
C:\Users\enWin7x64\Desktop\GravityProxyXE\x64InjectDll\MsPEng\x64\Release\MsPE
ng.pdb
It is likely that the payload is a proxy of some sort. To avoid naming collision with an
unrelated malware already named “Gravity”, we have named this malware “Gravy”.

A Zupdax sample was involved in campaigns apparently against Mongolian
targets [26]. Final payload is structurally very similar to a sample used against the
Vatican, though it is almost two years newer.

A Zupdax sample is configured to use C2 servers that have been associated with
FF-Rat activity [28]. This sample is structurally identical and has the same
compile time as the Vatican Zupdax sample.

The RedDelta activity was also reported used against Hong Kong Catholic
targets [2].

Most of our Server007 samples were compiled January 2019 and connect to the
C2 server at the IP address 45.192.160[.]214. Throughout early 2020 this IP
shared SSL certificate with another IP address at 154.213.21[.]70. This IP hosted
the domain lib.jsquerys[.]net - a similar domain name configuration as the
NewBounce C2 lib.hostareas[.]com.
These domains were also documented used for other RedDelta activity [31],
including the use of Cobalt Strike.
The Gravy injector sample contains traits found in other malware.

These samples have been associated with supply chain attacks on the gaming
industry as well as other targeted attacks against Vietnamese entities [32] [33],
and have also been associated with Vatican attacks [2]. The PDB strings are
however quite generic.
The P1Rat loader used for Zupdax has been used to install other malware –
notably Rshell, another previously undocumented backdoor.

Rshell uses the RC4 password “GoogleMailData” for its configuration data, same
as the password used for the encrypted payload and the P1Rat Zupdax
payloads. [34]
The targets appear to be Russian or Russian speaking, and one of the droppers
refers to the Russian aerospace entity ROSCOSMOS.

Sparkle samples share C2 infrastructure with Henbox/Farseer clusters via the C2
www.sunleon[.]com. This is the second link between Henbox activity and the
Vatican campaigns.

CONCLUSION
The targeting of persons connected to the Roman Catholic Church has been ongoing
since at least 2014. In Chapter 1 we detailed campaigns that appeared to target Italianspeaking persons likely connected to the Vatican. In Chapter 2 we detailed intrusions
seen on computers inside the Vatican City.
We assess the following with high confidence:
• The 2014-2016 PlugX and PoisonIvy campaigns against Vatican and
Vietnamese targets were performed by the same threat actors. There are
multiple close overlaps in toolsets and infrastructure.
• The 2018-2020 Vatican intrusion activity is linked with previous reporting on the
threat actors RedDelta and Mustang Panda. [2] [31] . There are multiple
infrastructure overlaps.
We assess the following with medium confidence:
• The two cases are likely linked and performed by the same or cooperating
groups. There are overlaps in toolset preferences, targeting, and at least one
infrastructure/unique malware contact point.
Several names for the threat actors have been used. Recorded Future introduced the
name RedDelta, while noting that the group overlaps with the previously known group
Mustang Panda. We have chosen not to distinguish between these groups.
There are many connections to other intrusion activity, both historic and more current.
This is nothing new for this region and there appears to be a great deal of resource
sharing between groups, and some groups appear to have wide-ranging interests.
We do not expect the attacks against the Catholic Church to end as long as it continues
to engage with and influence the lives of people in China and other South East Asian
countries.
In today’s open world, one should expect targeting of all sorts of interest groups and
individuals, not only targets associated with governments and corporations.
