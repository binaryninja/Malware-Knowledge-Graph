Avast tracks down Tempting Cedar Spyware

Threat Intelligence Team 21 Feb 2018
Social engineering used to trick Facebook users into downloading Advanced Persistent
Threat disguised as Kik Messenger app.
A few months ago, one of our customers contacted us regarding strange messages he
received on Facebook Messenger. The messages came from fake Facebook profiles
belonging to attractive, but fictitious women. These women encouraged him to download
another chat application to continue their conversations. The chat application the women
referred him to was spyware, disguised as the Kik Messenger app, distributed through a very
convincing fake site.
After analyzing the fake Kik Messenger app, we spotted the spyware, or Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT). We are calling the APT “Tempting Cedar Spyware”. We dug deeper
into our archives and found APKs belonging to several fake messenger and feed reader
apps, all of which included the same malicious modules.
During our analysis, we also discovered that our customer was not the only person to
encounter the Tempting Cedar Spyware, and, unfortunately, many fell for the trap.

1/20

Tempting Cedar Spyware was designed to steal information like contacts, call logs, SMS,
and photos, as well as device information, like geolocation - in order to keep track of
movements - and was capable of recording surrounding sounds, including conversations
victims had while their phone was within range.
Based on various clues from the fake Facebook profiles and the campaign infrastructure, we
believe the people behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware are Lebanese. The campaign was
highly targeted and ran deep under the radar. At the moment, Avast is one of few mobile
antivirus providers detecting the threat. Our detection is Android:SpyAgent-YP [Trj].
Due to the potential impact on the victims targeted with the malware, we contacted law
enforcement agencies to help us with threat mitigation.

Infection vector
More than just Facebook friends
The malware was distributed using several fake Facebook profiles. After engaging in flirty
conversations with their victims, which were most likely young men, the attackers offered to
move the conversation from Facebook to a more “secure and private” platform, where they
could have more intimate interactions. Then, the attackers sent a link to the victims, that led
to a phishing website, which hosted a downloadable and malicious version of the Kik
Messenger app. The victims had to adjust their device settings to install apps from unknown
sources, before installing the fake messaging app. This should raise red flags for users,
however, sometimes temptation trumps security.
Once the malware was installed, it immediately connected to a command and control (C&C)
server.
The spyware was spread using at least the following three fake Facebook profiles. We have
blurred the photos, as the photos used for the fake accounts were stolen from real people:

One interesting point to note is that the three girls interacted with one another on Facebook,
perhaps to make their profiles appear a bit more credible:

The website used to distribute a malicious copy of the Kik Messenger app, chatmessenger.site (185.8.237.151), operated until spring 2017 and was a very convincing
copycat.

Deep analysis
The Tempting Cedar Spyware is split into different modules with specific commands. There
are several modules designed to gather personal information about the victim, including
contacts, photos, call logs, SMS, as well as information about the mobile device, such as
geolocation, Android version, device model, network operator, and phone numbers.

Other modules were created to record audio streams or gain access to the infected device’s
file system.

The fake Kik application contains the same injected malicious class eighty9.guru and a
specific rsdroid.crt file with different certificates belonging to the C&C domain.

Through the reuse of the same rsdroid.crt certificate name, we were able to find additional
C&C and data exfiltration servers.

C&C administration and infrastructure
Following their victims’ every step
The malware communicated on the TCP port 2020, but it is also worth mentioning that there
was also a C&C console running on port 443 with a familiar certificate subject common name
- rsdroid.

10/20

The C&C console allowed attackers to live track their victims. The image below does not
include any data, as we don’t want to disclose any of the victims’ locations, but shows the
region where Tempting Cedar was spread the most:

Other hosts with this common name are easy to find using open source tools:

All signs point to Lebanon
It is always difficult to attribute persistent threat campaigns, like this one, to cybercriminals.
However, pieces of information point to the cybercriminals behind this campaign being
Lebanese.
The first clue that led us to this conclusion are the attackers’ working hours. We only saw
about 30 logins in the SSH log we received. The user root logged on on workdays,
occasionally on Saturdays, but never on Sundays.

13/20

The working hours in the SSH log correspond with Eastern European and Middle Eastern
time zones.
The second breadcrumb we found was the infrastructure used in the campaign, which also
points to Lebanon.
WHOIS data revealed that two domains used were registered by someone from Lebanon,
whereas others were registered with fictitious registrant data.
Chat-world.site was registered by Jack Zogby, Beirut, Lebanon, jack.zogby@yandex.com
Network-lab.info was registered by Jack Halawani, Beirut, Lebanon,
jack.halawani@yandex.com

14/20

Over the last two years, SSH logins were made from Lebanese ISPs’ IP ranges. (
185.99.32.0/22, 78.40.183.0/24)
One of the fake Facebook profile’s likes are also interesting, and if any of the victims had
taken a closer look at these, they may not have fallen for the scam. Rita, the petite brunette,
seems to be interested in military groups, and a Lebanese and Israel friendship.

Above: Rita’s likes on Facebook
The Lebanon & Israel Friendship connection group is interesting when considering the the
victims’ locations.
While we observed a low number of victims from the USA, France, Germany, and China, the
majority of victims were from the Middle East, with most of the victims located in Israel:

Conclusion
The targeted Tempting Cedar campaign has been running under the radar since as far back
as 2015, targeting people in Middle Eastern countries. The spyware’s infection vector
involves social engineering using attractive, but fictitious Facebook profiles. The fake Kik
APK sent to victims is masqueraded as a legitimate Kik Messenger app, however, after
gaining access to victims’ phones, the spyware starts to exfiltrate sensitive data, sending
data back to the attacker’s infrastructure. Evidence points to the attackers being a Lebanese
hacking group; however, we cannot be 100% sure this is true. The social engineering part of
the campaign seems to have targeted people in Eastern European and Middle Eastern
countries.
Despite unsophisticated techniques and the level of operational security being used, the
attack managed to remain undetected for several years.
The cybercriminals behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware were able to install a persistent
piece of spyware by exploiting social media, like Facebook, and people’s lack of security
awareness, and were thus able to gather sensitive and private data from their victims’
phones including real-time location data which makes the malware exceptionally dangerous.

Steps to take to protect yourself against spyware
Here are a few things you can do to avoid being manipulated like this into downloading
spyware:
Use antivirus software. Even if you accidentally download malware onto your phone,
Avast will detect and remove the malware, to keep your data and privacy safe.
Don’t talk to strangers. There is a reason why parents have been warning kids about
talking to strangers and this case confirms that talking to strangers online is no different
and is not a good idea.
Never open links or download software sent to you from untrusted sources. The
victims of this spyware campaign were tricked into downloading the spyware
themselves because they trusted the girls they were talking to online, despite never
meeting them in person. On top of this, they ignored Android’s warnings about
downloading apps from unknown sources.
Download from the source. Whenever possible, visit the homepage of an established
company directly - by typing in the URL yourself - as they often promote their mobile
apps on their websites and download the app straight from the source. Had the victims
done this, they would have avoided the fake and malicious Kik app. The “girls” probably
would have stopped talking to them, but that would have been for their own good!
