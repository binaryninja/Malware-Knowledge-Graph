Threat Intelligence Team

October 8, 2020

Update: PlayBack Now has reached back to us and confirmed that they have identified and
removed the malicious code from non active sites that were in the process of being archived
or being moved to a new platform.
They also stated that PlaybackNow does not store user data or credit card information but
that extra security and additional monitoring was put in place to prevent a credit card
skimmer attack from copying and transmitting credit card data entered into unauthorized
individuals/entities.
Additionally, the malicious domain playbacknows[.]com has been taken down.
—
We’ve seen many security incidents affecting different websites simultaneously because they
were loading the same tampered piece of code. In many instances, this is due to what we
call a supply-chain attack, where a threat actor targets one company that acts as an
intermediary to others.
In today’s case, the targeted websites all reside on the same server and sell video content
from various conferences and conventions. The host control panel belongs to Playback Now,
a company that provides its customers with an array of services to capture and deliver
recorded material into an online conference experience.

Criminals decided to impersonate Playback Now by registering a malicious domain lexically
close to their official website that could be used to discreetly serve a credit card skimmer as
well as collect stolen data.
Their next move was to inject a malicious reference to this skimmer code into dozens of
Magento sites hosted on the same IP address belonging to Playback Now. As a result, the
financial details from customers shopping for conference material are now at risk.

Online conference sites compromised with Inter skimming kit
Playback Now provides organizations with an easy way to seamlessly convert an event into
an online virtual experience. Conferences and seminars can be delivered via live streaming,
on demand, or a hybrid of the two.
Their offering of a virtual conference expo hall seems like a timely solution during the
pandemic for organizers and exhibitors to connect with customers just like at an in-person
event.

Businesses or organizations that want to join the experience can get a dedicated website
from where they will serve and promote their content. Take the following website built for the
Association of Healthcare Internal auditors.
Once users have registered and purchased one of the packages, they can access recorded
sessions online or save them onto a flash drive.

Figure 2: A Playback Now customer site that has been compromised
A closer look at the website’s source code reveals an external reference to a JavaScript file.
It would be easy to overlook, thinking it is served from the legitimate Playback Now website
(playbacknow.com), but there is an extra ‘s’ in that domain name (playbacknows[.]com) that
gives it away.

3/8

That domain was registered only a couple of weeks ago and its home page is void of any
content.
Domain name: playbacknows.com
Creation Date: 2020-09-21T20:22:10.00Z
Registrar: NAMECHEAP INC
Registrant Name: WhoisGuard Protected
Registrant Street: P.O. Box 0823-03411
Registrant City: Panama

In total, we detected the reference to this domain in over 40 websites belonging to different
organizations (see the IOCs section of this blogpost).
This JavaScript is a skimmer that has been lightly obfuscated and contains a certain number
of strings that are a common marking for the Inter skimming kit.

Figure 3: Checkout page where skimmer will steal credit card data
When someone purchases a course or conference recording, their personal and credit card
data will be leaked to criminals via the same malicious domain housing the skimmer.

Breach possibly related to Magento 1.x exploit
All affected Playback Now customer sites are running on the same IP address at
209.126.18.3. Using VirusTotal Graph we can see an interesting connection with a piece of
malware we previously documented.

Figure 4: VirusTotal graph showing a connection between malware and hosting server
This GoLang sample attempts to bruteforce access into a variety of Content Management
Systems. If successful, attackers could use the gained credentials to inject malicious code
into e-commerce sites.
This connection was interesting but lost some value when we looked at the submission date
for this sample to VirusTotal. It’s quite likely that the server was pinged just like many others,
but it’s unclear whether it would have resulted in a breach, even at a later date.
Based on an analysis of the compromised Playback Now related sites, we found they were
running a vulnerable version of the Magento CMS, namely version 1.x. Following the release
of an exploitation tool, a wave of attacks was recently observed, compromising over two
thousand sites.
Given the timeline, this incident could have been leveraging the same exploit and be carried
out by the same or perhaps a different group.
The official website playbacknow.com is hosted on 209.126.18.3 as well, but it does not
appear to be compromised. One thing to note though is that it is running a different CMS,
namely WordPress version 5.4.
We contacted Playback Now to report this breach. In the meantime, Malwarebytes Browser
Guard detects and blocks the fraudulent skimmer domain.
