U.S. Government agencies issue joint cybersecurity advisory cautioning that advanced threat
groups are chaining vulnerabilities together to gain entry into government networks and
elevate privileges.
Update October 13, 2020: The Identifying affected systems section has been updated to
include details about the availability of a Zerologon scan template for Tenable.io, Tenable.sc
and Nessus.

Background
On October 9, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published a joint cybersecurity advisory. The advisory, identified
as Alert AA20-283A, provides insight into advanced persistent threat (APT) actors’ activity
against networks associated with federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)
governments. The alert details how APT actors are using vulnerability chaining or exploit
chaining, incorporating a recently disclosed elevation of privilege vulnerability in their attacks.
The following is a list of vulnerabilities referenced in the CISA/FBI joint cybersecurity alert:

Analysis
Initial access gained through SSL VPN vulnerability
According to the CISA/FBI alert, the APT actors are “predominantly” using CVE-2018-13379
to gain initial access to target environments.
CVE-2018-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability in Fortinet’s FortiOS Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) virtual private network (VPN) solution. It was patched by Fortinet in April 2019.
However, it wasn’t until after exploitation details were made public in August 2019 that
reports emerged of attackers exploiting it in the wild.
In addition to the Fortinet vulnerability being used to gain initial access, CISA/FBI have also
observed “to a lesser extent,” APT actors using CVE-2020-15505, a remote code execution
vulnerability in MobileIron’s Core and Connector.
Post exploitation elevation of privilege using Zerologon
Once the APT actors have gained an initial foothold into their target environments, they are
elevating privileges using CVE-2020-1472, a critical elevation of privilege vulnerability in
Microsoft’s Netlogon. Dubbed “Zerologon,” the vulnerability has gained notoriety after it was
initially patched in Microsoft’s August Patch Tuesday release.
On September 18, CISA issued Emergency Directive 20-04 in an effort to ensure Federal
Civilian Executive Branch systems were patched against the vulnerability.
Zerologon observed as part of attacks in the wild
3/9

On September 23, Microsoft’s Security Intelligence team tweeted that they had observed the
Zerologon exploits being “incorporated into attacker playbooks” as part of threat actor
activity.
Microsoft is actively tracking threat actor activity using exploits for the CVE-2020-1472
Netlogon EoP vulnerability, dubbed Zerologon. We have observed attacks where public
exploits have been incorporated into attacker playbooks.
— Microsoft Security Intelligence (@MsftSecIntel) September 24, 2020
In a follow-up tweet on October 6, Microsoft’s Security Intelligence team noted a new
campaign leveraging CVE-2020-1472 originating from a threat actor known as
CHIMBORAZO, also known as TA505, a financially motivated nation-state actor.
We’re seeing more activity leveraging the CVE-2020-1472 exploit (ZeroLogon). A new
campaign shrewdly poses as software updates that connect to known CHIMBORAZO
(TA505) C2 infrastructure. The fake updates lead to UAC bypass and use of
wscript.exe to run malicious scripts.

CISA/FBI warn of additional vulnerabilities being targeted for initial access
In addition to the Fortinet and MobileIron vulnerabilities identified in recent campaigns, the
CISA/FBI alert also warns that these APT threat actors may also leverage one of the
following vulnerabilities to gain entry into their targeted networks:
CVE-2019-11510 is an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure
SSL VPN
CVE-2019-19781 is a path traversal vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery
Controller (ADC), Citrix Gateway and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliances
CVE-2020-1631 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Juniper’s Junos OS
HTTP/HTTPS service
CVE-2020-2021 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Security Assertion
Markup Language (SAML) authentication in PAN-OS when certain prerequisites are
met
CVE-2020-5902 is a path traversal vulnerability in the traffic management user
interface (TMUI) in F5’s BIG-IP application delivery service.
Evergreen vulnerabilities remain popular amongst threat actors
Many of the vulnerabilities referenced in this joint alert from CISA/FBI have become
evergreen flaws for threat actors. As part of CISA’s Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities
alert, they reference both the Pulse Secure and Citrix ADC vulnerabilities.

4/9

In September, CISA issued two separate alerts (AA20-258A, AA20-259A) that highlight how
APT actors from China and Iran are targeting unpatched vulnerabilities in Pulse Connect
Secure, Citrix ADC, and F5’s BIG-IP.
Elections support systems accessed, yet elections data integrity intact
In Alert AA20-283A, CISA mentions that they observed activity that “resulted in unauthorized
access to elections support systems.” However, they also mention that despite said
unauthorized access, they have no evidence to support that the “integrity of elections data
has been compromised.”
Zerologon needs to be patched immediately
With the latest alert from CISA and the FBI, coupled with reporting from other vendors, it
seems clear that Zerologon is becoming one of the most critical vulnerabilities of 2020.

Proof of concept
A number of proofs-of-concept (PoC) and exploit scripts were made available soon after
these vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed. The following is a subset of some of the PoCs
