During Anomali Threat Researcher’s tracking of the “Royal Road” Rich Text Format
(RTF) weaponizer, commonly used by multiple Chinese threat actors to exploit CVE2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802, it was discovered that multiple Chinese threat groups
updated their weaponizer to exploit the Microsoft Equation Editor (EE) vulnerability CVE2018-0798 late 2018. We believe the groups moved to use CVE-2018-0798 instead of
the other Microsoft Equation Editor Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
because the former is more reliable as it works on all known versions of Equation Editor.
The analyzed RTF ﬁles share the same object dimension (objw2180\objh300) used to
track the RTF weaponizer in our previous report, however, the sample was not exploiting
CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802. After further analysis, it was discovered that the
RTF ﬁles were exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft’s Equation Editor
(EQNEDT32). CVE-2018-0798 does not appear to be a commonly exploited In The Wild
(ITW) even though it is more reliable compared to other well-known EE RCE
counterparts,this is mainly because C|VE2018-0798 works with all EE versions while the
counterparts are limited to speciﬁc versions. CVE-2017-11882 is only exploitable on an
unpatched version prior to its ﬁx, and CVE-2018-0802 is only exploitable on the version
released to ﬁx CVE-2017-11882. In contrast, a threat actor utilizing CVE-2018-0798 has
a higher chance of success because it is not limited by version.
Anomali Researchers were able to identify multiple samples of malicious RTF
documents ITW using the same exploit for CVE-2018-0798. Some of the analyzed
samples have a creation date of November 19, 2017 (ﬁve days after a patch was
released for CVE-2017-11882), however, that date appears to be incorrect because the
dropped payloads had a recent compilation timestamps in 2019. The earliest use of the

exploit ITW we were able to identify and conﬁrm is a sample
(e228045ef57fb8cc1226b62ada7eee9b) dating back to October 2018 (VirusTotal
submission of 2018-10-29) with the RTF creation time 2018-10-23.
Multiple samples analyzed by Anomali researchers that we associate with CVE-20180798 were also mentioned in previous instances by other researchers in the security
community. We believe that some of these were misattributed to CVE-2017-11882 or
CVE-2018-0802 when they actually appear to be CVE-2018-0798.

Vulnerability and Exploit Analysis
CVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability, a stack buffer overﬂow that can be exploited by
a threat actor to perform stack corruption. The vulnerable subroutine is located at the
relative virtual address 0x43f6c (sub_443f6c), shown in Figure 1 below. This routine is
called by EQNEDT32 when parsing Matrix type records. To note, CVE-2017-11882 and
CVE-2018-0802 are vulnerabilities that take place when parsing Font type records. Part
of the Matrix record object is copied to a stack buffer without proper bound checks. This
allows the threat actor to overﬂow the stack buffer, change the stored return address,
and take control of the instruction pointer. Due to the age of this binary, it was compiled
and linked in the early 2000s, it does not use any modern protections against stack
overﬂows that would have made exploitation much harder.

Figure 1 - The vulnerable function before the exploit. The saved return address marked
in red is manipulated. Instruction at 0x1283faa copies a byte from the equation object to
a stack buffer and return from the call.
The write primitive is used to ﬁll the stack with padding 0x60s and 0x61s until the
location of the stored return address on the stack. The lower two bytes of the stored
return address are changed to 0x0bfb, as depicted in Figure 2. Changing those bytes
allows hijackig the control ﬂow when the return address is popped off the stack and into
the instruction pointer (EIP). The instruction pointer is then redirected to the return
instruction of a function to pop the next value off the stack, located at 0x20ed94 in Figure
2, and into the EIP. This forces the original function argument to be taken as a return
address. The argument points to the heap where the equation object has been stored.

Threat Actors and Exploit Usage
Most of the collected Samples were attributed to the following Chinese Cyber Espionage
threat actor:
Conimes
KeyBoy
Emissary Panda
Rancor
Temp.Trident
However,Beginning on 25 June 2019, we started observing multiple commodity
campaigns (Mostly dropping AsyncRAT) using the updated RTF weaponizer with the
same exploit (CVE-2018-0798). As observed previously with CVE-2017-11882 and CVE2018-0802, the weaponizer was used exclusively by Chinese cyber espionage actors for
approximately one year (December 2017 through December 2018), after which
cybercrime actors began to incorporate it in their malicious activity. This indicates that
the weaponizer author is now selling to a wider group of actors.
Examples of social engineering lures and malicious document content used with CVE2018-0798 in cyberespionage attacks are shown in Table 1.

Exploitation Methods and payload Analysis:
Anomali Threat Researchers identiﬁed multiple exploitation techniques using CVE-20180798 to drop malicious payloads. Some of the observed techniques identiﬁed being used
to exploit the vulnerability are as follows:

OLE package objects and DLL Sideloading
Sample MD5: fc47442f175ff7e312a4aa4f5c8745b8 (Goblin Panda)
The malicious RTF document contains OLE Package objects. On execution (user
opening the attachment) the document drops OLE package as “8.t” in the %TEMP%
directory. The 8.t ﬁle is a dropper and it is encrypted using XOR cipher with encryption
key “0xFC”. Upon decrypting and executing, it drops two additional ﬁles “wsc_proxy.exe”
(legitimate Avast executable) and a malicious DLL “wsc.dll” in the %TEMP% folder. The
dropper then creates a scheduled task to run the executable “wsc_proxy.exe” for every
ﬁve minutes as a persistence mechanism.

Schedule task command:
“schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn "Avast Antivirus" /tr
"C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\wsc_proxy.exe" /mo 5 /f”
The benign executable “wsc_proxy.exe” gets executed by the scheduled task "Avast
Antivirus," and using DLL sideloading the malicious payload “wsc.dll” gets started. The
malware attempts to communicate via HTTP to the C2 at vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net
over port 2113/TCP.

OLE package objects and VBScript Execution
Sample MD5: b3f8abe274cb6a5926bd5c3fc2168997 (Rancor Group)
The malicious RTF drops embedded OLE package to “8.t” into the %TEMP% directory
after the malicious document is opened. The ﬁle 8.t is a malicious executable dropper
and encrypted via XOR cipher using the key “0xFC”. On execution it drops two ﬁles
“ChromeApp.ps1” and “ChromeApp.vbs” in the directory “C:\Windows\tracing\”. It then
creates a scheduled task named “ChromeApp” to execute the Visual Basic Script
(VBScript). The VBScript calls the PowerShell script and it beacons out to C2
“185.234.73[.]4” using HTTP to send the victim User ID and receiving further instructions
to execute.

Dropping ‘.wll’ ﬁle in Microsoft Word ‘startup’ folder
Sample MD5: 019debaee6fdf9a9f872277563f0d9ee
The RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “8.t” in the %TEMP% directory
whe the ﬁle is opened. The shellcode decrypt “8.t” and save it as
“%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\cclerr.wll”. The next time user opens Microsoft
Word, the dropped ﬁle “cclerr.wll” will be loaded and executed in Word’s process
memory.
During the next run of Microsoft Word, the below activities were observed,
1. The cclerr.wll gets copied into “C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Intel(R) Processor
Graphics” as “RasTls.dll”
2. The legitimate executable IntelGraphicsController.exe is used to load the
malicious “RasTls.dll” via DLL search-order hijacking technique.

On opening the RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “s.bin” in the
%TEMP% directory. The equation editor loads the bin ﬁle directly into its memory space
as code and jumps to it. The code in “s.bin” ﬁle extracts and load a DLL. It then creates a
directory “C:\Program Files (x86)\pcawhere” and writes a ﬁle named “conﬁg.ini” with a
unique identiﬁer for the victim. After successful execution of malicious code, it tries to
send the unique identiﬁer of the victim machine to the C2 138.68.133.211 via POST
request over HTTPS.

Conclusion
Analysis of the Royal Road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple
Chinese threat groups started utilizing CVE-2018-0798 in their RTF weaponizer. This
ﬁnding conﬁrms that the groups, as mentioned in our previous report, are sharing the
same exploit supply chain. The groups appear to have been using the Microsoft
vulnerability exploit exclusively for approximately six months before it began appearing in
commodity-malware campaigns. This may indicate that the Chinese groups sold the
exploit after using it in their malicious campaigns.

These ﬁndings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing
capabilities because CVE-2018-0798 is not widely reported on and it is typically not
incorporated into publicly available weaponizers.
