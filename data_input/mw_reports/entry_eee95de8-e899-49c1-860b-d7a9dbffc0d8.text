PrivateLoader is a loader from a pay-per-install malware distribution service that has been
utilized to distribute info stealers, banking trojans, loaders, spambots, and ransomware on
Windows machines. First seen in early 2021, being hosted on websites that claim to provide
cracked software, the customers of the service are able to selectively deliver malware to
victims based on location, financial activity, environment, and specific software installed.
BitSight's partial visibility over its botnet of infected machines suggests that it’s spread
worldwide, with a significant percentage of infections in India and Brazil.

Infection chain
PrivateLoader was seen being distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to
provide cracked software. Victims download a password-protected zip file (the password is in
the file name) which contains an NSIS installer that executes many malicious payloads,
including PrivateLoader. It’s a multi-stage malware loader comprising at least three modules:
the loader, the core, and the service.
In the first stage, the loader is executed, which downloads and executes the second stage,
the core module. The core module's primary purpose is to download and execute more
malware, including another PrivateLoader module named service. The service module takes
care of persistence by creating a scheduled task and, not only self-updates but also
downloads and executes the loader module. Figure 1 depicts the typical infection chain.

Capabilities
The main purpose of PrivateLoader is to download and execute more malware. Moreover,
both static and dynamic analysis (Fig. 3 and 2) suggest that the malware has additional
capabilities, such as disabling Windows Defender, the discovery of user-sensitive data, and
many anti-analysis techniques.

Moreover, previous research on PrivateLoader shared a YARA rule to detect and hunt its
samples based on its string decryption technique and also a python script to extract all of its
strings, which contains valuable information when reversing the malware. Those strings can
also be used for defense, hunting, and tracking purposes since the command and control
servers (C2) and other configuration values are included in them. As an example, here are
all of the strings from a loader module, a core module, and a service module.

Botnet tracking
Combining the mentioned sample hunting technique with previous research on how the bots
communicate with their C2 servers allowed us to build a tracker that gives us visibility over
what’s being distributed by PrivateLoader.
We started tracking PrivateLoader in July 2022 and so far we’ve seen 1K+ URLs used to
distribute 2K+ samples. As an example, this URL was used to distribute 4 samples of
Redline malware. We’ve seen many URLs from Discord, VK, and Amazon CDNs, although
domains and IPs are also often used.
Figure 4 shows the top malware distributed by PrivateLoader this past July and August. Most
of them are stealers, Redline being by far the most common, but there are also banking
trojans, loaders, spambots, and even ransomware.

4/6

We were able to identify with high confidence 30 malware families being distributed by
PrivateLoader. They are AgentTesla, Amadey, ArrowRAT, AsyncRAT, Azorult, Colibri,
Danabot, DCRat, Eternity, Fabookie, Formbook, GCleaner, Glupteba, Gozi_ISFB,
PseudoManuscrypt, Nitol, NetSupport, Nymaim, PrivateLoader, Qakbot, Raccoon, Redline,
SmokeLoader, Socelars, STOP, Tofsee, Vidar, WarzoneRAT, XMRig, and YTStealer. For
some of them, we only encounter a couple of samples, and so they are included in the
“others” slice.
Regarding the unknown samples, since this classification was done in an automated way,
some samples are harder to programmatically classify; some signatures probably need to be
improved, but also some of them might be new unknown malware. By sampling and
manually analyzing some of the unknown samples, we mainly identify Redline and
SmokeLoader, although Fabookie, Vidar, Raccoon, and NekoStealer families were also
observed.
BitSight's partial visibility over the geographical distribution of PrivateLoader in July 2022
suggests that it’s spread worldwide, with a significant percentage of infections in India (21%)
and Brazil (16%), as figure 5 shows.

The data used to populate this map is sampled, which means that the actual geographic
distribution of PrivateLoader may be closer to this one but not exactly what this map
suggests.

Threat Hunting Signatures
Yara rule
The following rule was tested with VirusTotal Retrohunt, which returned 1K+ samples within a
one-year time period:

Suricata rule
The following rule was tested with a PCAP generated from a sandbox run of the loader
module:
