March 12, 2020

ESET researchers found a watering hole (aka strategic web compromise) operation targeting
several high-proﬁle Armenian websites. It relies on a fake Adobe Flash update lure and delivers
two previously undocumented pieces of malware we have dubbed NetFlash and PyFlash.
Various aspects of this campaign lead us to attribute this operation to Turla, an infamous
espionage group active for more than ten years. Its main targets include governmental and
military organizations. We have previously reported multiple campaigns of this group including
Mosquito and LightNeuron.
This recent operation bears similarities to several of Turla’s watering hole campaigns that we
have tracked in the past years. In particular, the modus operandi is similar to a campaign we
uncovered in 2017. The various pieces of JavaScript used there are almost identical to those in
this campaign, but the targets and payloads are different.

Targeted websites
In this speciﬁc operation, Turla has compromised at least four Armenian websites, including two
belonging to the government. Thus, it is likely the targets include government ofﬁcials and
politicians.
According to ESET telemetry, the following websites were compromised:
armconsul[.]ru: The consular Section of the Embassy of Armenia in Russia
mnp.nkr[.]am: Ministry of Nature Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of
Artsakh
aiisa[.]am: The Armenian Institute of International and Security Affairs
adgf[.]am: The Armenian Deposit Guarantee Fund
We have indications that these websites were compromised since at least the beginning of 2019.
We notiﬁed the Armenian national CERT and shared our analysis with them before publication.
Turla operators leveraged unknown access methods to these websites to insert a piece of
malicious JavaScript code. For example, for mnp.nkr[.]am, they appended obfuscated code at the
end of jquery-migrate.min.js (a common JavaScript library), as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Obfuscated JavaScript code injected into the mnp.nkr[.]am website

This code loads an external JavaScript from skategirlchina[.]com/wpincludes/data_from_db_top.php. We analyze this code in the next section.
Since the end of November 2019, we noticed that skategirlchina[.]com was not delivering
malicious scripts anymore. Thus, it is likely the Turla operators have suspended this watering hole
operation.

Fingerprinting and malware delivery
Upon visiting a compromised webpage, the second-stage malicious JavaScript is delivered by
skategirlchina[.]com and ﬁngerprints the visitor’s browser. Figure 2 shows the main function of this
script.
If it is the ﬁrst time the user’s browser executes the script, it will add an evercookie with a
seemingly random MD5 value provided by the server, different at each execution of the script.
The implementation of the evercookie is based on code available on GitHub. It uses multiple
storage places such as the local database, local shared objects (Flash cookies), Silverlight
storage, etc., to store the cookie value. In comparison to a regular cookie, it will be much more
persistent as it won’t be deleted if the user just deletes the browser’s cookies.
This evercookie will be used to track whether the user visits one of the compromised websites
again. When the user comes back for a second time, the previously stored MD5 value will be
used to identify them.
Then, it collects several pieces of information including the browser plugin list, the screen
resolution and various operating system information. This is sent to the C&C server in a POST
request. If there is a reply, it is assumed to be JavaScript code and is executed using the eval
function.

Figure 2. Fingerprint script (malicious URLs defanged)
If the visitor is deemed interesting, the server replies with a piece of JavaScript code that creates
an iframe. Data from ESET telemetry suggests that, for this campaign, only a very limited number
of visitors were considered interesting by Turla’s operators.
This iframe displays a fake Adobe Flash update warning to the user, shown in Figure 3, in order
to trick them into downloading a malicious Flash installer.

We did not observe the use of any browser vulnerabilities. The compromise attempt relies only on
this social engineering trick. Once the malicious executable is downloaded from the same server
as the iframe’s JavaScript, and if the user launches it manually, a Turla malware variant and a
legitimate Adobe Flash program are installed.
Figure 4 is an overview of the compromise process from initially visiting one of the compromised
Armenian websites to the delivery of a malicious payload.

Malware
Once the user executes the fake installer, it will execute both a Turla malware variant and a
legitimate Adobe Flash installer. Thus, the user is likely to believe that the update warning was
legitimate.

Before September 2019: Skipper
Prior to the end of August 2019, the victim would receive a RAR-SFX archive containing a
legitimate Adobe Flash v14 installer and a second RAR-SFX archive. The latter contains the
various components of a backdoor known as Skipper that has been previously attributed to Turla.
It was documented in 2017 by researchers from Bitdefender, and a more recent version was
documented by Telsy in May 2019.
Given that there are only minor changes between the documented versions and the most recent
ones, we won’t provide a detailed analysis here.
One interesting change is that the Skipper communication module uses the server that hosts this
campaign’s remote JavaScripts and malicious binaries for its C&C server, speciﬁcally
skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/ms-locale.php.

From September 2019: NetFlash and PyFlash
At the end of August 2019, we noticed that the payload delivered by skategirlchina[.]com
changed.

NetFlash (.NET downloader)
The new payload was a .NET application that dropped an installer for Adobe Flash v32 in
%TEMP%\adobe.exe, and NetFlash (a .NET downloader) in %TEMP%\winhost.exe.
According to their compilation timestamps, the malware samples were compiled at the end of
August 2019 and at the beginning on September 2019, right before being uploaded to the
watering hole’s C&C server.
NetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and establishes
persistence for this new backdoor using a Windows scheduled task. Figure 5 shows the NetFlash
function that downloads the second stage malware, named PyFlash. We also encountered
another NetFlash sample, likely compiled at the end of August 2019, with a different hardcoded
C&C server: 134.209.222[.]206:15363.

PyFlash
This second stage backdoor is a py2exe executable. py2exe is a Python extension to convert a
Python script into a standalone Windows executable. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time the
Turla developers have used the Python language in a backdoor.
The backdoor communicates with its hardcoded C&C server via HTTP. The C&C URL and other
parameters such as the AES key and IV used to encrypt all network communications are
speciﬁed at the beginning of the script, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Global variables in the PyFlash Python script

The main function of the script, shown in Figure 7, sends information about the machine to the
C&C server. This is the output of the functions from the commands list seen in Figure 6. It
includes OS-related commands (systeminfo, tasklist) and network-related commands (ipconﬁg,
getmac, arp).

Figure 7. Main function of PyFlash

The C&C server can also send backdoor commands in JSON format. The commands
implemented in this version of PyFlash are:
Download additional ﬁles from a given HTTP(S) link.
Execute a Windows command using the Python function subprocess32.Popen.
Change the execution delay: modiﬁes the Windows task that regularly (every X minutes; 5
by default) launches the malware.
Kill (uninstall) the malware. To conﬁrm this instruction the malware sends a POST request
to the C&C server with the following string:
I’m dying :(
Tell my wife that i love her…
Then, the output of the command is sent back to the operators, encrypted with AES, via a POST
request.

Conclusion
Turla is still using watering hole attacks as one of its initial access tactics. Interestingly, this
campaign relies on a well-known social engineering trick – a fake Adobe Flash update warning –
in order to induce the user to download and install malware.
On the other hand, the payload has changed, probably in order to evade detection, as Skipper
has been known for many years. They switched to NetFlash, which installs a backdoor we call
PyFlash and that is developed in the Python language.
We will continue monitoring new Turla activities and will publish relevant information on our blog.
