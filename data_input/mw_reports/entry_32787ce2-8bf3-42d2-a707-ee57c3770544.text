December 4, 2017

Today, with help from Microsoft security researchers, law enforcement agencies around the globe, in cooperation
with Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), announced the disruption of Gamarue, a widely distributed malware
that has been used in networks of infected computers collectively called the Andromeda botnet.
The disruption is the culmination of a journey that started in December 2015, when the Microsoft Windows
Defender research team and DCU activated a Coordinated Malware Eradication (CME) campaign for Gamarue.
In partnership with internet security firm ESET, we performed in-depth research into the Gamarue malware and
its infrastructure.
Our analysis of more than 44,000 malware samples uncovered Gamarue’s sprawling infrastructure. We provided
detailed information about that infrastructure to law enforcement agencies around the world, including:
1,214 domains and IP addresses of the botnet’s command and control servers
464 distinct botnets
More than 80 associated malware families
The coordinated global operation resulted in the takedown of the botnet’s servers, disrupting one of the largest
malware operations in the world. Since 2011, Gamarue has been distributing a plethora of other threats,
including:
Petya and Cerber ransomware
Kasidet malware (also known as Neutrino bot), which is used for DDoS attacks
Lethic, a spam bot
Info-stealing malware Ursnif, Carberp, and Fareit, among others

A global malware operation
For the past six years, Gamarue has been a very active malware operation that, until the takedown, showed no
signs of slowing down. Windows Defender telemetry in the last six months shows Gamarue’s global prevalence.

The Gamarue bot
Gamarue is known in the underground cybercrime market as Andromeda bot. A bot is a program that allows an
attacker to take control of an infected machine. Like many other bots, Gamarue is advertised as a crime kit that
hackers can purchase.
The Gamarue crime kit includes the following components:
Bot-builder, which builds the malware binary that infects computers
Command-and-control application, which is a PHP-based dashboard application that allows hackers to
manage and control the bots
Documentation on how to create a Gamarue botnet
A botnet is a network of infected machines that communicate with command-and-control (C&C) servers, which
are computer servers used by the hacker to control infected machines.
The evolution of the Gamarue bot has been the subject of many thorough analyses by security researchers. At
the time of takedown, there were five known active Gamarue versions: 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, and 2.10. The
latest and the most active is version 2.10.
Gamarue is modular, which means that its functionality can be extended by plugins that are either included in the
crime kit or available for separate purchase. The Gamarue plugins include:
Keylogger ($150) – Used for logging keystrokes and mouse activity in order to steal user names and
passwords, financial information, etc
Rootkit (included in crime kit) – Injects rootkit codes into all processes running on a victim computer to
give Gamarue persistence
Socks4/5 (included in crime kit) – Turns victim computer into a proxy server for serving malware or
malicious instructions to other computers on the internet
Formgrabber ($250) – Captures any data submitted through web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Internet
Explorer)

Teamviewer ($250) – Enables attacker to remotely control the victim machine, spy on the desktop, perform
file transfer, among other functions
Spreader – Adds capability to spread Gamarue malware itself via removable drives (for example, portable
hard drives or flash drives connected via a USB port); it also uses Domain Name Generation (DGA) for the
servers where it downloads updates

Gamarue attack kill-chain
Over the years, various attack vectors have been used to distribute Gamarue. These include:
Removable drives
Social media (such as Facebook) messages with malicious links to websites that host Gamarue
Drive-by downloads/exploit kits
Spam emails with malicious links
Trojan downloaders
Once Gamarue has infected a machine, it contacts the C&C server, making the machine part of the botnet.
Through the C&C server, the hacker can control Gamarue-infected machines, steal information, or issue
commands to download additional malware modules.

Figure 4. Gamarue’s attack kill-chain
Gamarue’s main goal is to distribute other prevalent malware families. During the CME campaign, we saw at
least 80 different malware families distributed by Gamarue. Some of these malware families include:
Petya (ransomware)
Cerber (ransomware)
Troldesh (ransomware)
Ursnif (info-stealing and banking trojan)
Carberp (info-stealing and banking trojan)
Fareit (info-stealing and DDoS malware)
Kasidet (worm and DDoS malware)

Lethic (spam bot)
Cutwail (spam bot)
Neurevt (click-fraud malware)
Ursnif (click-fraud malware)
Fynloski (backdoor)
The installation of other malware broadens the scale of what hackers can do with the network of infected
machines.

Command-and-control communication
When the Gamarue malware triggers the infected machine to contact the C&C server, it provides information like
the hard disk’s volume serial number (used as the bot ID for the computer), the Gamarue build ID, the operating
system of the infected machine, the local IP address, an indication whether the signed in user has administrative
rights, and keyboard language setting for the infected machine. This information is sent to the C&C server via
HTTP using the JSON format:

Figure 5. Information sent by Gamarue to C&C server
The information about keyboard language setting is very interesting, because the machine will not be further
infected if the keyboard language corresponds to the following countries:
Belarus
Russia
Ukraine
Kazahkstan
Before sending to the C&C server, this information is encrypted with RC4 algorithm using a key hardcoded in the
Gamarue malware body.

Figure 6. Encrypted C&C communication
Once the C&C server receives the message, it sends a command that is pre-assigned by the hacker in the
control dashboard.

Figure 7. Sample control dashboard used by attackers to communicate to Gamarue bots
The command can be any of the following:
Download EXE (i.e., additional executable malware files)
Download DLL (i.e., additional malware; removed in version 2.09 and later)
Install plugin
Update bot (i.e., update the bot malware)
Delete DLLs (removed in version 2.09 and later)
Delete plugins
Kill bot
The last three commands can be used to remove evidence of Gamarue presence in machines.
The reply from the C&C server is also encrypted with RC4 algorithm using the same key used to encrypt the
message from the infected machine.

Figure 8. Encrypted reply from C&C server
When decrypted, the reply contains the following information:
Time interval in minutes – time to wait for when to ask the C2 server for the next command
Task ID – used by the hacker to track if there was an error performing the task
Command – one of the command mentioned above
Download URL – from which a plugin/updated binary/other malware can be downloaded depending on the
command.

Anti-sandbox techniques
Gamarue employs anti-AV techniques to make analysis and detection difficult. Prior to infecting a machine,
Gamarue checks a list hashes of the processes running on a potential victim’s machine. If it finds a process that
may be associated with malware analysis tools, such as virtual machines or sandbox tools, Gamarue does not
infect the machine. In older versions, a fake payload is manifested when running in a virtual machine.

Stealth mechanisms
Gamarue uses cross-process injection techniques to stay under the radar. It injects its code into the following
legitimate processes:
msiexec.exe (Gamarue versions 2.07 to 2.10)
wuauclt.exe, wupgrade.exe, svchost.exe (version 2.06)
It can also use a rootkit plugin to hide the Gamarue file and its autostart registry entry.
Gamarue employs a stealthy technique to store and load its plugins as well. The plugins are stored fileless, either
saved in the registry or in an alternate data stream of the Gamarue file.

OS tampering
Gamarue attempts to tamper with the operating systems of infected computers by disabling Firewall, Windows
Update, and User Account Control functions. These functionalities cannot be re-enabled until the Gamarue
infection has been removed from the infected machine. This OS tampering behavior does not work on Windows
10

Monetization
There are several ways hackers earn using Gamarue. Since Gamarue’s main purpose is to distribute other
malware, hackers earn using pay-per-install scheme. Using its plugins, Gamarue can also steal user information;
stolen information can be sold to other hackers in cybercriminal underground markets. Access to Gamarueinfected machines can also be sold, rented, leased, or swapped by one criminal group to another.

Remediation
To help prevent a Gamarue infection, as well as other malware and unwanted software, take these precautions:
Be cautious when opening emails or social media messages from unknown users.
Be wary about downloading software from websites other than the program developers.

More importantly, ensure you have the right security solutions that can protect your machine from Gamarue and
other threats. Windows Defender Antivirus detects and removes the Gamarue malware. With advanced machine
learning models, as well as generic and heuristic techniques, Windows Defender AV detects new as well as
never-before-seen malware in real-time via the cloud protection service. Alternatively, standalone tools, such as
Microsoft Safety Scanner and the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), can also detect and remove
Gamarue.
Microsoft Edge can block Gamarue infections from the web, such as those from malicious links in social media
messages and drive-by downloads or exploit kits. Microsoft Edge is a secure browser that opens pages within
low privilege app containers and uses reputation-based blocking of malicious downloads.
In enterprise environments, additional layers of protection are available. Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection can help security operations personnel to detect Gamarue activities, including cross-process injection
techniques, in the network so they can investigate and respond to attacks. Windows Defender ATP’s enhanced
behavioral and machine learning detection libraries flag malicious behavior across the malware infection process,
from delivery and installation, to persistence mechanisms, and command-and-control communication.
To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced
attacks, sign up for a free trial.
Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) can block Gamarue infections from email uses built-in anti-spam
filtering capabilities that help protect Office 365 customers. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection helps secure
mailboxes against email attacks by blocking emails with unsafe attachments, malicious links, and linked-to files
leveraging time-of-click protection.
Windows Defender Exploit Guard can block malicious documents (such as those that distribute Gamarue) and
scripts. The Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature in Windows Defender Exploit Guard uses a set of built-in
intelligence that can block malicious behaviors observed in malicious documents. ASR rules can also be turned
on to block malicious attachments from being run or launched from Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail,
Hotmail, or Yahoo).
Microsoft is also continuing the collaborative effort to help clean Gamarue-infected computers by providing a onetime package with samples (through the Virus Information Alliance) to help organizations protect their customers.
