Summary
In November 2021, ThreatLabz identified a previously undocumented variant of an
attack chain used by the South Korea-based Dark Hotel APT group. We also discovered
new activity on the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure previously associated with
this APT group. The new activity on their infrastructure aligns with the type of targets
chosen by this threat actor in the past.
In this blog, we describe our new findings in detail, including technical analysis of the
attack chain and its components as well as the C2 infrastructure analysis.

Threat attribution
DarkHotel is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group based out of South Korea that
has been active since at least 2007. They are known to target senior business executives
by uploading malicious code to their computers through infiltrated hotel WiFi networks,
as well as through spear-phishing and P2P attacks.
We attribute this attack chain to the Dark Hotel APT group with a high level of
confidence due to the below reasons:
1. The multi-layer malicious document which drops a scriptlet post-exploitation.
2. Filename of the dropped file system artifacts such as the scriptlet file googleofficechk.sct
3. The command-and-control (C2) commands are the same as earlier payloads used by
Dark Hotel.
4. Timestamps of the dropped payloads are around the same timeframe when previously
documented Dark Hotel APT activity was observed.

Attack flow
Figure 1 below illustrates the full attack chain.

Technical analysis
For the purpose of technical analysis we will consider the document with MD5 hash:
89ec1f32e1bbf794c41fa5f5bc6869c0
[+] Stage 1: Malicious document
The first stage of this attack is a multi-layered malicious document which defines an
AltChunk element to load an embedded DOCX file. The embedded DOCX file defines
another AltChunk element which loads an embedded malicious RTF file. Figure 2 below

shows one of the defined AltChunk elements and its corresponding relationship.

Figure 2: AltChunk element and its corresponding relationship
The malicious RTF file contains three OLE objects as shown in Figure 3

Figure 3: OLE objects present inside malicious RTF
When the RTF file is loaded, the three OLE objects are dropped in the %temp% directory
with the names “p”, “b” and “googleofficechk.sct”. Out of these three dropped files, the
scriptlet file (googleofficechk.sct) is executed which is described in detail in the next
section.
[+] Stage-2: Scriptlet file
Similar to what has been described previously by Antiy Labs, the first operation
performed by the scriptlet file is to send a Base64 encoded list of running processes to
the configured C2 server. It sends a POST request to the URL “http://signingconfig[.]com/cta/key.php” with DATA “L=G641giQQOWUiXE&q={Base64 encoded list
of running processes}”
The subsequent operations performed by this scriptlet file differ from what has been
observed in past attacks.

The scriptlet file in our case performs the following operations:
1. Checks if the directory “%LOCALAPPDATA%\PeerDistRepub\” exists else creates it.
2. Checks for the presence of file “%LOCALAPPDATA%\PeerDistRepub\msrvcd32.exe”.
If the file exists, then it doesn't perform further operations.
Note: This file check is likely performed to detect if the machine is already infected,
which also indicates that the threat actor used multiple variations while performing the
attack.
3. Releases the IP addresses bound to all DHCP-enabled network adapters
4. Copies the executable from “%temp%\p” to
“%LOCALAPPDATA%\PeerDistRepub\qq3104.exe”
5. Copies the executable from “%temp%\b” to
“%LOCALAPPDATA%\PeerDistRepub\qq2688.exe”
6. Creates a ZoneIdentifier ADS (Alternate Data Stream) corresponding to the files
copied above with the following content:
ZoneTransfer
ZoneId=1
Note: The ZoneID=1 is written to create the false evidence that the file was downloaded
from the Intranet
7. Execute the binary “qq3104.exe” whose functionality is described in detail in the next
section
8. Renew the IPv4 address for the network adapters
Figure 4 below shows the relevant scriptlet code

Figure 4: Scriptlet code
[+] Stage-3: Dropped binaries
# qq3104.exe
As mentioned in the previous section, the binary qq3104.exe gets executed as part of the
operations performed by the scriptlet file. This binary mainly performs three operations:
1. Spoofs the process related information in the PEB structure to pretend as explorer.exe

Figure 5: Code snippet responsible for PEB modification
2. Perform UAC bypass using elevation moniker against the vulnerable COM interfaces
{3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7} and {D2E7041B-2927-42fb-8E9F7CE93B6DC937}

3. Execute the binary qq2688.exe
# qq2688.exe
This binary on execution checks if there is any running process with the name
“360Tray.exe” or “QQPCTray.exe” and does some firewall checks. These process names
correspond to security software popularly used in China.
The main operation performed by the binary is to register a Windows service which also
serves as a persistence mechanism.
To register the Windows service, the binary creates the registry key
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\X” and
populates the service related registry values. Along with the service related registry
values, two additional registry values are defined with the name “s” and “x” under the
same registry key.
Based on the service registry values, it is an auto start service which executes VBScript
code using mshta.exe.

Figure 6: Code snippet responsible for registering the Windows service
The VBScript code in turn executes an encoded PowerShell command which is shown in
Figure 8 below

Figure 7: Decoded PowerShell command executed by VBScript code
[+] Stage-4: PowerShell scripts
The PowerShell command which is executed as part of the service execution reads,
decodes and executes the data stored under registry value
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\X\\s”.
The decoded data is a PowerShell script which executes another PowerShell command.
The command is shown in Figure 9 below.

Figure 8: Decoded PowerShell command executed by PowerShell script
Similar to the first PowerShell command it also reads, decodes and executes the data
stored under registry value
“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\X\\x”.
The decoded data is an obfuscated PowerShell script which embeds an encoded .NET dll.
The .NET dll is loaded and executed in-memory from within the PowerShell script.
[+] Stage-5: .NET dll
The .NET dll on analysis turns out to be the same downloader which is described in
Antiy blog. The only changes are in the configured C2 servers and the parameters which
are used as part of network requests.
Information about the C2 servers is provided in Indicators of compromise section while
the format for network requests is described below:
Request format for data exfiltration:
{C2 server URL}?im={MAC address}&mk=u&ltc={victim information}
OR
{C2 server URL}?xt={MAC address}&mk=u&ltc={victim information}
Request format for payload download:
{C2 server URL}?im={MAC address}&mk=d
OR
{C2 server URL}?xt={MAC address}&mk=d

[+] C2 infrastructure analysis
We analyzed the C2 infrastructure related to the IP address of the server hosting the
domain - signing-config[.]com. This domain was configured in the stage-2 scriptlet
file and used to exfiltrate system information to the C2 server.
IP address = 23.111.184[.]119
Leveraging passive DNS data, we identified several domains hosted on the server with
the above IP address and noticed a pattern in the domain names. A lot of domains were
created to spoof the names of organizations in China related to the government,
education, and political think tanks.
Below are a few examples summarized in a table:

In addition to this, we also identified several newly registered domains on this server
which are used to spoof cryptocurrency projects popularly used in China such as the
Deeper network.

The domain, deepersbot[.]network was registered by the threat actor to spoof the
legitimate domain, deeper[.]network.

Figure 9: Phishing website
The fake domain asks the users to validate their wallet on the main page and presents
them an option to choose from a wide variety of popularly used crypto currency wallets.

Once the user chooses the wallet type, they will be redirected to a page which prompts
them to share their private key.

Figure 11: Page asking for user Private key information
It uses one of the following 3 ways:
Phrase: A 12 or 24 word recovery phrase which can be used to restore the private key
and steal the funds.
JSON file: a password-protected JSON file which stores the encrypted private key
Private key: The private key itself
The table below summarizes the list of domains registered which use social engineering
to steal the private keys of crypto currency wallets of the users:
