Roundup Highlight: Activity on Previously Identified APT33 Domains

20200908A: Previously Identified APT33 Domains Resolving to 109.230.199[.]157

1/3

Our highlight in this Roundup in Incident 20200908A: Previously Identified APT33 Domains
Resolving to 109.230.199[.]157. A number of APT33 domains previously identified in a
TrendMicro report on obfuscated command and control infrastructure — zeverco[.]com
(oliverleftley@inbox[.]com), service-eset[.]com (wata.nakatsu@mail[.]com), simsoshop[.]com
(tsuda2016@mail[.]com), and qualitweb[.]com (tsuyukisogawa@inbox[.]lv) — began
resolving to 109.230.199[.]157 starting in late July 2020. At this time, we do not know if this
IP address is a sinkhole or parking IP used for previous malicious infrastructure. Further, we
don’t know the extent to which the aforementioned domains are still under APT33’s control. If
109.230.199[.]157 is a sinkhole or not under APT33’s control, then the following additional
infrastructure is not necessarily associated with APT33 and may be associated with a
different actor.
Several additional domains not previously associated with APT33 or other actors’ activity
also began resolving to this IP in the last two months. The identified domains (and their
registrants when known) include the following:
publicsecur[.]com
akadnsplugin[.]com (joshua.toon1978@mail[.]com)
service-houston[.]com
support-newyork[.]com
ocsp-support[.]com (warren.jones2626@mail[.]com)
Given our uncertainty on whether the previous domains and 109.230.199[.]157 IP address
are under APT33’s control, we do not know if these domains are also associated with
APT33. Regardless, they merit further scrutiny as some of them were registered through
suspicious resellers like THCservers that various state and criminal actors have used to
procure infrastructure.
Also of note, the ocsp-support[.]com domain may be associated with two other domains —
prefmsedge[.]com (warren.jones6363@inbox[.]lv) and tracking-protection[.]net
(warrenjones39458@protonmail[.]com) — based on the reuse of the “Warren Jones” strings
in the email address. Unlike ocsp-support[.]com, these domains were registered through
AminServe.

20200909A: CDN and News-spoofing Probable Phishing Domains Hosted at
185.228.83[.]110 ThreatConnect Research identified a set of suspicious domains
hosted on a probable dedicated server that spoof various content delivery networks
(CDNs), news organizations, and file sharing sites. At least one of the domains was
identified in phishing activity spoofing an Italian organization. Additional associated
domains were identified based on SSL certificate reuse.
