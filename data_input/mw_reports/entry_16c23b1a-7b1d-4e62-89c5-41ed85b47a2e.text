Operation “Armor Piercer:” Targeted attacks in the Indian
subcontinent using commercial RATs
blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-armor-piercer.html

By Asheer Malhotra, Vanja Svajcer and Justin Thattil.
Cisco Talos is tracking a campaign targeting government personnel in India using
themes and tactics similar to APT36 (aka Mythic Leopard and Transparent Tribe).

1/30

This campaign distributes malicious documents and archives to deliver the Netwire and
Warzone (AveMaria) RATs.
The lures used in this campaign are predominantly themed around operational
documents and guides such as those pertaining to the "Kavach" (hindi for "armor") twofactor authentication (2FA) application operated by India's National Informatics Centre
(NIC).
This campaign utilizes compromised websites and fake domains to host malicious
payloads, another tactic similar to Transparent Tribe.

What's new?
Cisco Talos recently discovered a malicious campaign targeting government employees and
military personnel in the Indian sub-continent with two commercial and commodity RAT
families known as NetwireRAT (aka NetwireRC) and WarzoneRAT (aka Ave Maria). The
attackers delivered a variety of lures to their targets, predominantly posing as guides related
to Indian governmental infrastructure and operations such as Kavach and I.T.-related guides
in the form of malicious Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) and archives (RARs, ZIPs)
containing loaders for the RATs.

Apart from artifacts involved in the infection chains, we've also discovered the use of serverside scripts to carry out operational tasks such as sending out malicious emails and
maintaining presence on compromised sites via web shells. This provides additional insight
into the attacker's operational TTPs.
Some of these lures and tactics utilized by the attackers bear a strong resemblance to the
Transparent Tribe and SideCopy APT groups, including the use of compromised websites
and fake domains.

How did it work?
This campaign uses a few distinct, yet simple, infection chains. Most infections use a maldoc
that downloads and instruments a loader. The loader is responsible for downloading or
decrypting (if embedded) the final RAT payload and deploying it on the infected endpoint. In
some cases, we've observed the use of malicious archives containing a combination of
maldocs, loaders and decoy images. The RAT payloads are relatively unmodified, with the
command and control (C2) IPs and domains being the most pivotal configuration information.

So what?
2/30

This campaign illustrates another instance of a highly motivated threat actor using a set of
commercial and commodity RAT families to infect their victims. These RATs are packed with
many features out-of-the-box to achieve comprehensive control over the infected systems. It
is also highly likely that these malware families establish footholds into the victim's networks
to deploy additional plugins and modules.

Infection chains
The earliest instance of this campaign was observed in December 2020 utilizing malicious
Microsoft Office documents (maldocs). These maldocs contain malicious VBA macros that
download and execute the next stage of the infection — the malware loader.
The maldocs' content ranges from security advisories, to meeting schedules, to software
installation notes. These maldocs contain malicious macros that download and execute the
next stage payload on the victim's endpoint. The final payload is usually a RAT that can
perform a multitude of malicious operations on the infected endpoint.
The maldocs pose as documents related to either meeting schedules pertinent to the victims,
or as technical guides related to the Government of India's IT infrastructure. It is likely that
these files are either delivered as attachments or links in spear-phishing emails where the
verbiage is meant to social engineer the victims into opening the maldoc attachments or
downloading them from an attacker-controlled link.
Some file names used are:
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm
Security-Updates.docm
Online meeting schedule for OPS.doc
schedule2021.docm

3/30

Interestingly, we've observed the use of Kavach-themed maldocs and binaries being used in
recent SideCopy attacks.

Stage 2 — Loaders
The payload is usually loader binaries aimed at instrumenting the final malware payload.
These loaders will use either of the following techniques to instrument the final malware
payloads on the endpoint:
Download payload from remote location and activate using process hollowing into itself
or a target process.
Decode embedded payload and activate using process hollowing.
Depending on the variants, the loaders may also perform the following peripheral activities:
Disable AMSI scanning by patching the first six bytes of the "AmsiScanBuffer" API.
Set up persistence via registry for the next stage malware payload dropped to disk
using the HKCU\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run keys.
Downloaders
Throughout March and April 2021, the attackers utilized downloaders to download and

4/30

execute the RAT payloads from remote locations. The earliest versions of this loader used
RunPE DLLs to inject the malware payloads into a specified target process via hollowing.

.NET loader utilizing RunPE.dll to inject AveMaria RAT payload into InstallUtil.exe.
In May 2021, the attackers used the next iteration of their C#-based downloader that reaches
out to a decoy URL and only proceeds with execution if the communication process fails.

Downloader reaching out to a decoy URL and executing actual functionality in the catch code
block.
This downloader then proceeds to patch the "AmsiScanBuffer" API, establishes persistence
for the next stage payload and invokes it at the end. The payload in the next stage consists
of legitimate .NET-based applications trojanized with the ability to decrypt and deploy the

5/30

NetwireRAT malware.

AMSI bypass, persistence and invocation by the loader.

6/30

Toward the beginning of June 2021, the attackers started experimenting with the use of
Pastebin as a payload-hosting platform. The downloader reached out to a Pastebin URL via
cURL to download and inject the payload into its own running process.
Evolution of the downloaders:

Loaders with embedded payloads
The attackers modified open-source projects with code to load trojanized .NET-based
binaries as loaders for the RATs dating as far back as December 2020. One of the droppers
we analyzed is based on the Pangantucan Community High School library management
system application.
It is likely that the loader is based on a crypter available to the attackers since we've
observed other crimeware families such as Formbook use similar loaders to infect their
targets.
7/30

The original application Initialization code for Form1.

The same function in the trojanized version calls a constructor to the added ISectionEntry
class.
The loader modified the Login form with a call to a function that loads a DLL loader with the
assembly name "SimpleUI." The second-stage loader is extracted from the .NET resource
with the name "Draw." The assembly extracted from the Draw resource is responsible for
decoding and loading a Netwire injector module which is stored as the AuthorizationRule
bitmap resource in the original trojanized loader.

8/30

AutorizationRule blob parsed as a bitmap image (464,147 bytes long).
The injector is responsible for deploying the netwireRAT binary present in its .NET resources
into a target process, such as vbc.exe.

Stage 3 — Final payloads
The Netwire and AveMaria RAT families are eventually downloaded and executed on the
victim machine. In some cases, we've also discovered the deployment of custom .NETbased file enumerator modules that generate and exfiltrate file path listings of specific file
extensions on the infected systems.

Maldoc infection chain variation
In one instance, the attackers used a different variation of the infection chain that starts with
a malicious document delivered to the victim. The macro in the maldoc downloads and
executes a VBScript (VBS) instead of directly downloading the malware payload.
The VBS contains many junk comments interlaced with the actual malicious code. The
malicious code will execute an encoded PowerShell command to download the next payload.
The PowerShell downloads a malicious archive and an unzip utility such as 7-Zip from a
remote location. This utility unzips and runs the malware payload from the archive file. An
example of the command used to unzip the archive is:
7za.exe x -y -aoa -bso0 -bse0 -bb0 -bd <archive_file_path>

9/30

Decoded PowerShell commands to activate the next-stage payload.

The final payload in this infection chain is a loader for AveMariaRAT.

Archive-based infections
In other infection attempts dating as far back as December 2020, the attackers hosted
malicious ZIP archives containing malware payloads on compromised websites. It is likely
10/30

that the URLs to these archive files were sent to victims to make them download and open
the malware payload on their endpoints.

Three distinct archives containing the malicious payloads.
The malicious binaries from the archives found thus far load and instrument NetwireRAT.

Payload Analysis

NetwireRAT
Netwire is a highly versatile RAT consisting of multiple capabilities including:
Stealing credentials from browsers.
Execute arbitrary commands.
Gather system information.
File management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files, etc.
Enumerate, terminate processes.
Keylogging.

11/30

NetwireRAT keylogger.

Ave Maria/WarzoneRAT
Ave MariaRAT, also known as WarzoneRAT, is a commercial RAT available for purchase to
malicious operators although there are cracked versions of Warzone available online.

12/30

13/30

WarzoneRAT capabilities (snip) as advertised by its authors.
Like Netwire, WarzoneRAT is also packed with a variety of functionalities including:
Remote desktop.
Webcam capture.
Credential stealing from browsers and email clients.
File management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files etc.
Execute arbitrary commands.
Keylogging.
Reverse shells.
Enumerate, terminate processes.

14/30

Reverse shell functionality in WarzoneRAT.

File enumerators
Apart from the two RATs, we've also observed specialized reconnaissance malware being
deployed on the victim's endpoints instead of a RAT family. The attackers deployed a
preliminary recon tool to enumerate specific folders looking for certain file extensions. The
file listings/paths found are uploaded to an attacker-controlled C2 server.
The locations targeted were:
C:\Users\<current_user>\Downloads\
C:\Users\<current_user>\Desktop\
C:\Users\<current_user>\Documents\
C:\Users\<current_user>\OneDrive\Downloads\
C:\Users\<current_user>\OneDrive\Desktop\
C:\Users\<current_user>\OneDrive\Documents\
The file extensions searched for were:
.txt, .doc, .dot, .wbk, .docx, .docm, .dotx, .dotm, .docb, .xls, .xlt, .xlm, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xltx, .xltm,
.xlsb, .xla, .xlam, .xll, .xlw, .ppt, .pot, .pps, .pptx, .pptm, .potx, .potm, .ppam, .ppsx, .ppsm,

Analyses and observations

Targeting
An extremely common theme of maldocs and archives discovered in this campaign refers to
the Government of India's Kavach application. This is a two-factor authentication (2FA)
application used by government employees to access their emails. This theme has been
used recently by the SideCopy APT's campaigns targeting Indian government personnel, as
well. Some of the malicious artifacts using the Kavach theme in the current campaign are
named:
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER1.5.docm
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-3.docm
kavach-2-instructions.zip
kavach-2-instructions.exe
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.zip
KAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.exe
Other file names indicating targeting of military and government personnel consist of:
CONFD-PERS-Letter.docm
PERS-CONFD-LETTER.exe
Admiral_Visit_Details_CONFD.exe

Compromised websites
The attackers have relied on a combination of compromised websites and fake domains to
carry out their operations — a tactic similar to that of the Transparent Tribe APT group.
However, what stands out in this campaign is the focus on compromising quasi-military or
government-related websites to host malicious payloads. This might have been done to
appear legitimate to victims and analysts.
For example, the attackers compromised and maintained access to a quasi-defense-related
website dsoipalamvihar[.]co[.]in belonging to the Defence Services Officers' Institute (DSOI)
using it to host netwireRAT-related payloads since January 2021. In another instance, the
attackers compromised the website for the Army Public Schools of India (apsdigicamp[.]com)
to host a variety of malicious archives serving NetwireRAT again.
On the other hand, the attackers used a fake domain govrn[.]xyz in July 2021 to host
maldocs for their infection chains.

17/30

Malicious scripts and payloads hosted on a compromised website.

Infrastructure

18/30

The compromised websites were used heavily to host artifacts from maldocs to RATs.
However, these websites hosted a few other malicious artifacts as well. The artifacts scripts
were used as:
Emailers.
Web shells.
CSRF PoC generator.
File uploaders.
None of these scripts have been written from scratch or customized heavily by the attackers.
This practise is in sync with their RAT deployments — neither the RAT payloads nor the
infrastructure scripts have been modified except their configurations. The actual effort
instead is put into social engineering and infecting victims.
Proliferation through emails
A variety of mailers have been used by the attackers to proliferate the maldocs, archives and
download links:
TeamCC ninjaMailer v1.3.3.7
Leaf PHPMailer 2.7
Leaf PHPMailer 2.8
These PHP-based scripts are capable of configuring SMTP options and generating spearphishing emails that can be distributed to victims with malicious payloads or links.

19/30

TeamCC NinjaMailer hosted by the attackers on one of the compromised sites.

Administration
The attackers utilized two types of management scripts to administer the compromised
websites. PHP and Perl-based web shells maintain browser-based access to the sites and
perform administrative actions such as file management, process management and viewing
file contents. The web shells used are:
PhpSpy
b374k 2.7
Older b374k web shell

b374k web shell's login page on the compromised site.

20/30

Older Perl-based b374k web shell hosted on a compromised site.
The attackers also deployed a file uploader utility (created by "Pakistan Haxors Crew") to
upload files to the sites without having to go through the web shells.

Conclusion
21/30

This campaign has been ongoing since the end of 2020 and continues to operate today. The
attackers initially deployed Netwire and Warzone RATs on the infected endpoints. The use of
these RATs benefits an adversary twofold — it makes attribution difficult and saves the effort
to create bespoke implants. Beginning in July 2021, however, we observed the deployment
of the file enumerators alongside the RATs. This indicates that the attackers are expanding
their malware arsenal to target their victims: military and government personnel in India.
Infection tactics including government-themed lures, deployment of commodity/commercial
RATs and file enumerators and the use of compromised and attacker-owned domains
indicates a strong resemblance to SideCopy and Transparent Tribe.
Unlike many crimeware and APT attacks, this campaign uses relatively simple,
straightforward infection chains. The attackers have not developed bespoke malware or
infrastructure management scripts to carry out their attacks, but the use of prebaked artifacts
doesn't diminish the lethality of these attacks. In fact, ready-made artifacts such as
commodity or cracked RATs and mailers allow the attackers to rapidly operationalize new
campaigns while focusing on their key tactic: tricking victims into infecting themselves.
