We discussed the re-emergence of banking malware EMOTET in September and how it has
adopted a wider scope since it wasn't picky about the industries it attacks. We recently
discovered that EMOTET has a new iteration (detected as TSPY_EMOTET.SMD10) with a
few changes in its usual behavior and new routines that allow it to elude sandbox and
malware analysis.
Based on our findings, EMOTET’s dropper changed from using RunPE to exploiting
CreateTimerQueueTimer. CreateTimerQueueTimer is a Windows application programming
interface (API) that creates a queue for timers. These timers are lightweight objects that
enable the selection of a callback function at a specified time. The original function of the API
is to be part of the process chain by creating a timer routine, but here, the callback function

of the API becomes EMOTET’s actual payload. EMOTET seems to have traded RunPE for a
Windows API because the exploitation of the former has become popular while the latter is
lesser known, theoretically making it more difficult to detect by security scanners.

Figure 2. When the EMOTET dropper executes at Stage 4, the Stage 5 payload at 0x
0x428310 will be injected to CreateTimerQueueTimer.
This is not the first malware we've seen abusing CreateTimerQueueTimer. Hancitor, a
banking Trojan that dropped PONY and VAWTRAK, also exploited the API in its dropper,
which is a malicious macro document.
Anti-Analysis and Anti-Sandbox Techniques
We also observed a new behavior in this variant, which is its anti-analysis technique. Some
malware are designed to sleep for a period of time to avoid detection from malware analysis
products. The analysis platform will change its sleep period to a very short time to scan for
malicious activities. EMOTET’s anti-analysis technique involves checking when the scanner
monitors activities to dodge detection. CreateTimerQueueTimer helps EMOTET do the job
every 0x3E8 milliseconds.
This variant has the ability to check if it’s inside a sandbox environment at the second stage
of its payload. The EMOTET loader will not proceed if it sees that it’s running inside a
sandbox environment.
The dropper will check for the following to discern whether it is running in a sandbox
environment:
When NetBIOS’ name is TEQUILABOOMBOOM.
When UserName is Wilber, NetBIOS’ name starts with SC, and NetBIOS name starts
with CW.
When UserName is admin, DnsHostName is SystemIT, and if there’s a Debugger
symbol file like C:\\Symbols\aagmmc.pdb.
When Username is admin, and NetBIOS name is KLONE_X64-PC
When UserName is John Doe.
When UserName is John and there are two files called C:\\take_screenshot.ps1 and
C:\\loaddll.exe.
When these files are present: C:\\email.doc, C:\\123\\email.doc, and
C:\\123\\\email.docx.
When these files are present: C:\\a\\foobar.bmp, C:\\a\\foobar.doc, and C:\\a\\foobar.gif.

payload will also not be launched.

As part of its unpacking technique, this variant will run itself through another process if it
does not have admin privilege. If the process has admin privilege, it will proceed with the
following:
1. Create new service as an auto start to make malware persistent
2. Change the service description to “Provides support for 3rd party protocol plug-ins for
Internet Connection Sharing.”
3. Start the service.
4. Collect system information such as process name and system information
5. Encrypt the collected information via the AES-128 algorithm and SHA1 hash algorithm.
6. Encrypt the information and POST at the C&C server.

Infection Chain

Figure 7. The variant’s infection chain
The infection chain of this variant starts with a phishing email. The email contains a malicious
URL that will drop a document file containing a malicious macro.

Enterprises and end-users can avoid threats like EMOTET by following best practices for
defending against phishing attacks. Users should always be cautious of individuals or
organizations that ask for personal information. Most companies will not ask for sensitive
data from its customers. When in doubt, users should verify with the company to avoid any
potential issues. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading files even if they come
from seemingly “trustworthy” sources. In addition, enterprises can stay protected by
employing strong security policies to their email gateway and ensuring that their network
infrastructure can filter, validate, and block malicious traffic like anomalous data exfiltration.
