Control System Defense: Know the Opponent
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-265a

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats.
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and
monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive
target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat
(APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or
destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber
actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property
damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.
OT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often incorporate vulnerable information
technology (IT) components, and include external connections and remote access that
increase their attack surfaces. In addition, a multitude of tools are readily available to exploit
IT and OT systems. As a result of these factors, malicious cyber actors present an increasing
risk to ICS networks.
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats to
those systems. However, owners and operators who understand cyber actors’ tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) can use that knowledge when prioritizing hardening
actions for OT/ICS.
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory, which builds on previous NSA and CISA guidance to stop
malicious ICS activity and reduce OT exposure [1] [2], describes TTPs that malicious actors
use to compromise OT/ICS assets. It also recommends mitigations that owners and
operators can use to defend their systems. NSA and CISA encourage OT/ICS owners and
operators to apply the recommendations in this CSA.

Technical Details
OT/ICS assets operate, control, and monitor industrial processes throughout U.S. critical
infrastructure. Traditional ICS assets are difficult to secure due to their design for maximum
availability and safety, coupled with their use of decades-old systems that often lack any
recent security updates. Newer ICS assets may be able to be configured more securely, but

1/11

often have an increased attack surface due to incorporating Internet or IT network
connectivity to facilitate remote control and operations. The net effect of the convergence of
IT and OT platforms has increased the risk of cyber exploitation of control systems. [3]
Today’s cyber realm is filled with well-funded malicious cyber actors financed by nationstates, as well as less sophisticated groups, independent hackers, and insider threats.
Control systems have been targeted by a variety of these malicious cyber actors in recent
years to achieve political gains, economic advantages, and possibly destructive effects. [4]
[5] [6] [7] [8] More recently, APT actors have also developed tools for scanning,
compromising, and controlling targeted OT devices. [9]

Malicious actors’ game plan for control system intrusions
Cyber actors typically follow these steps to plan and execute compromises against critical
infrastructure control systems:
1. Establish intended effect and select a target.
2. Collect intelligence about the target system.
3. Develop techniques and tools to navigate and manipulate the system.
4. Gain initial access to the system.
5. Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effect.
Leveraging specific expertise and network knowledge, malicious actors such as nation-state
actors can conduct these steps in a coordinated manner, sometimes concurrently and
repeatedly, as illustrated by real world cyber activity. [5] [10]

Establish intended effect and select a target
Cyber actors, from cyber criminals to state-sponsored APT actors, target critical
infrastructure to achieve a variety of objectives. Cyber criminals are financially motivated and
target OT/ICS assets for financial gain (e.g., data extortion or ransomware operations).
State-sponsored APT actors target critical infrastructure for political and/or military
objectives, such as destabilizing political or economic landscapes or causing psychological
or social impacts on a population. The cyber actor selects the target and the intended effect
—to disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy—based on these objectives. For
example, disabling power grids in strategic locations could destabilize economic landscapes
or support broader military campaigns. Disrupting water treatment facilities or threatening to
destroy a dam could have psychological or social impacts on a population. [11] [12]

Collect intelligence about the target system
Once the intent and target are established, the actor collects intelligence on the targeted
control system. The actor may collect data from multiple sources, including:

2/11

Open-source research: A great deal of information about control systems and their
designs is publicly available. For example, solicitation information and employment
advertisements may indicate components and—list specific model numbers.
Insider threats: The actor may also leverage trusted insiders, even unwitting ones, for
collecting information. Social engineering often elicits a wealth of information from
people looking for a new job or even just trying to help.
Enterprise networks: The actor may compromise enterprise IT networks and collect
and exfiltrate ICS-related information. Procurement documents, engineering
specifications, and even configurations may be stored on corporate IT networks.
In addition to OT-specific intelligence, information about IT technologies used in control
systems is widely available. Knowledge that was once limited to control system engineers
and OT operators has become easily available as IT technologies move into more of the
control system environment. Control system vendors, in conjunction with the owner/operator
community, have continually optimized and reduced the cost of engineering, operating, and
maintaining control systems by incorporating more commodity IT components and
technologies in some parts of OT environments. These advancements sometimes can make
information about some systems easily available, thereby increasing the risk of cyber
exploitation.

Develop techniques and tools
Using the intelligence collected about the control system’s design, a cyber actor may procure
systems that are similar to the target and configure them as mock-up versions for practice
purposes. Nation-state actors can easily obtain most control system equipment. Groups with
limited means can still often acquire control systems through willing vendors and
secondhand resellers.
Access to a mock-up of the target system enables an actor to determine the most effective
tools and techniques. A cyber actor can leverage resident system utilities, available
exploitation tools; or, if necessary, develop or purchase custom tools to affect the control
system. Utilities that are already on the system can be used to reconfigure settings and may
have powerful troubleshooting capabilities.
As the control system community has incorporated commodity IT and modernized OT, the
community has simplified the tools, techniques, scripts, and software packages used in
control systems. As a result, a multitude of convenient tools are readily available to exploit IT
and OT systems.
Actors may also develop custom ICS-focused malware based on their knowledge of the
control systems. For example, TRITON malware was designed to target certain versions of
Triconex Tricon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) by modifying in-memory firmware to
add additional programming. The extra functionality allows an actor to read/modify memory

3/11

contents and execute custom code, disabling the safety system. [13] APT actors have also
developed tools to scan for, compromise, and control certain Schneider Electric PLCs,
OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture
(OPC UA) servers. [9]
With TTPs in place, a cyber actor is prepared to do virtually anything that a normal system
operator can, and potentially much more.

Gain initial access to the system
To leverage the techniques and tools that they developed and practiced, cyber actors must
first gain access to the targeted system.
Most modern control systems maintain remote access capabilities allowing vendors,
integrators, service providers, owners, and operators access to the system. Remote access
enables these parties to perform remote monitoring services, diagnose problems remotely,
and verify warranty agreements.
However, these access points often have poor security practices, such as using default and
maintenance passwords. Malicious cyber actors can leverage these access points as vectors
to covertly gain access to the system, exfiltrate data, and launch other cyber activities before
an operator realizes there is a problem. Malicious actors can use web-based search
platforms, such as Shodan, to identify these exposed access points.
Vendor access to control systems typically use connections that create a bridge between
control system networks and external environments. Often unknown to the owner/operator,
this bridge provides yet another path for cyber exploitation and allows cyber actors to take
advantage of vulnerabilities in other infrastructure to gain access to the control system.
Remote access points and methodologies use a variety of access and communication
protocols. Many are nothing more than vendor-provided dial-up modems and network
switches protected only by obscurity and passwords. Some are dedicated devices and
services that communicate via more secure virtual private networks (VPNs) and encryption.
Few, if any, offer robust cybersecurity capabilities to protect the control system access points
or prevent the transmission of acquired data outside the relatively secure environment of the
isolated control system. This access to an ostensibly closed control system can be used to
exploit the network and components.

Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effects
Once an actor gains initial access to targeted OT/ICS system, the actor will execute
techniques, tools, and malware to achieve the intended effects on the target system. To
disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy the system, the malicious actor often
performs, in any order or in combination, the following activities:
4/11

1. Degrade the operator's ability to monitor the targeted system or degrade the operator’s
confidence in the control system’s ability to operate, control, and monitor the targeted
system. Functionally, an actor could prevent the operator's display (human machine
interface, or HMI) from being updated and selectively update or change visualizations
on the HMI, as witnessed during the attack on the Ukraine power grid. [5] (Manipulation
of View [T0832] )
2. Operate the targeted control system. Functionally, this includes the ability to modify
analog and digital values internal to the system (changing alarms and adding or
modifying user accounts), or to change output control points — this includes abilities
such as altering tap changer output signals, turbine speed demand, and opening and
closing breakers. (Manipulation of Control [T0831])
3. Impair the system's ability to report data. Functionally, this is accomplished by
degrading or disrupting communications with external communications circuits (e.g.,
ICCP , HDLC , PLC , VSAT, SCADA radio, other radio frequency mediums), remote
terminal units (RTUs) or programmable logic controllers (PLCs), connected business or
corporate networks, HMI subnetworks, other remote I/O, and any connected
Historian/bulk data storage. (Block Reporting Message [T0804], Denial of View
[T0815])
4. Deny the operator's ability to control the targeted system. Functionally, this includes the
ability to stop, abort, or corrupt the system’s operating system (OS) or the supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system’s software functionality. (Denial of Control
[T0813])
5. Enable remote or local reconnaissance on the control system. Functionally, an actor
could obtain system configuration information to enable development of a modified
system configuration or a custom tool. (Collection [TA0100], Theft of Operational
Information [T0882])
Using these techniques, cyber actors could cause various physical consequences. They
could open or close breakers, throttle valves, overfill tanks, set turbines to over-speed, or
place plants in unsafe operating conditions. Additionally, cyber actors could manipulate the
control environment, obscuring operator awareness and obstructing recovery, by locking
interfaces and setting monitors to show normal conditions. Actors can even suspend alarm
functionality, allowing the system to operate under unsafe conditions without alerting the
operator. Even when physical safety systems should prevent catastrophic physical
consequences, more limited effects are possible and could be sufficient to meet the actor’s
intent. In some scenarios though, if an actor simultaneously manipulates multiple parts of the
system, the physical safety systems may not be enough. Impacts to the system could be
temporary or permanent, potentially even including physical destruction of equipment.

Mitigations

5/11

The complexity of balancing network security with performance, features, ease-of-use, and
availability can be overwhelming for owner/operators. This is especially true where system
tools and scripts enable ease-of-use and increase availability or functionality of the control
network; and when equipment vendors require remote access for warranty compliance,
service obligations, and financial/billing functionality. However, with the increase in targeting
of OT/ICS by malicious actors, owner/operators should be more cognizant of the risks when
making these balancing decisions. Owner/operators should also carefully consider what
information about their systems needs to be publicly available and determine if each external
connection is truly needed. [1]
System owners and operators cannot prevent a malicious actor from targeting their systems.
Understanding that being targeted is not an “if” but a “when” is essential context for making
ICS security decisions. By assuming that the system is being targeted and predicting the
effects that a malicious actor would intend to cause, owner/operators can employ and
prioritize mitigation actions.
However, the variety of available security solutions can also be intimidating, resulting in
choice paralysis. In the midst of so many options, owner/operators may be unable to
incorporate simple security and administrative strategies that could mitigate many of the
common and realistic threats. Fortunately, owner/operators can apply a few straightforward
ICS security best practices to counter adversary TTPs.

Limit exposure of system information
Operational and system information and configuration data is a key element of critical
infrastructure operations. The importance of keeping such data confidential cannot be
overstated. To the extent possible, avoid disclosing information about system hardware,
firmware, and software in any public forum. Incorporate information protection education into
training for personnel. Limit information that is sent out from the system.
Document the answers to the following questions:
1. From where and to where is data flowing?
2. How are the communication pathways documented and how is the data
secured/encrypted?
3. How is the data used and secured when it arrives at its destination?
4. What are the network security standards at the data destination, whether a
vendor/regulator or administrator/financial institution?
5. Can the data be shared further once at its destination? Who has the authority to share
this data?
Eliminate all other data destinations. Share only the data necessary to comply with
applicable legal requirements, such as those contractually required by vendors—nothing
more. Do not allow other uses of the data and other accesses to the system without strict
6/11

administrative policies designed specifically to protect the data. Prevent new connections to
the control system using strict administrative accountability. Ensure strict agreements are in
place with outside systems/vendors when it comes to sharing, access, and use. Have strong
policies for the destruction of such data. Audit policies and procedures to verify compliance
and secure data once it gets to its destination, and determine who actually has access to it.

Identify and secure remote access points
Owner/operators must maintain detailed knowledge of all installed systems, including which
remote access points are—or could be—operating in the control system network. Creating a
full “connectivity inventory” is a critical step in securing access to the system.
Many vendor-provided devices maintain these access capabilities as an auxiliary function
and may have services that will automatically ‘phone home’ in an attempt to register and
update software or firmware. A vendor may also have multiple access points to cover
different tasks.
Once owner/operators have identified all remote access points on their systems, they can
implement the following recommendations to improve their security posture:
Reduce the attack surface by proactively limiting and hardening Internet-exposed
assets. See CISA’s Get Your Stuff Off Search page for more information.
Establish a firewall and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the control system and the
vendor’s access points and devices. Do not allow direct access into the system; use an
intermediary service to share only necessary data and only when required. For more
information see CISA’s infographic Layering Network Security Through Segmentation.
[14]
Consider using virtual private networks (VPNs) at specific points to and from the
system rather than allowing separate access points for individual devices or vendors.
Utilize jump boxes to isolate and monitor access to the system.
Ensure that data can only flow outward from the system – administratively and
physically. Use encrypted links to exchange data outside of the system.
Enforce strict compliance with policies and procedures for remote access, even if
personnel complain that it is too difficult.
If the system does not use vendor access points and devices, ensure that none are
active. Use strict hardware, software, and administrative techniques to prevent them
from becoming covertly active.
Do not allow vendor-provided system access devices and software to operate
continuously in the system without full awareness of their security posture and access
logs.
Install and keep current all vendor-provided security systems associated with the
installed vendor access points.

7/11

Review configurations to ensure they are configured securely. Operators typically focus
on necessary functionality, so properly securing the configurations and remote access
may be overlooked.
Consider penetration testing to validate the system’s security posture and any unknown
accesses or access vulnerabilities.
Add additional security features to the system as needed. Do not assume that one
vendor has a monopoly on the security of their equipment; other vendors may produce
security features to fill gaps.
Change all default passwords throughout the system and update any products with
hard-coded passwords, especially in all remote access and security components.
Patch known exploited vulnerabilities whenever possible. Prioritize timely patching of
all remote access points. Keep operating systems, firewalls, and all security features
up-to-date.
Continually monitor remote access logs for suspicious accesses. Securely aggregate
logs for easier monitoring.

Restrict tools and scripts
Limit access to network and control system application tools and scripts to legitimate users
performing legitimate tasks on the control system. Removing the tools and scripts entirely
and patching embedded control system components for exploitable vulnerabilities is often
not feasible. Thus, carefully apply access and use limitations to particularly vulnerable
processes and components to limit the threat.
The control system and any accompanying vendor access points may have been delivered
with engineering, configuration, and diagnostic tools pre-installed. Engineers use these tools
to configure and modify the system and its processes as needed. However, such tools can
also be used by a malicious actor to manipulate the system, without needing any special
additional tools. Using the system against itself is a powerful cyber exploitation technique.
Mitigations strategies include:
1. Identify any engineering, configuration, or diagnostic tools.
2. Securely store gold copies of these tools external to the system if possible.
3. Remove all non-critical tools.
4. Prevent these tools from being reinstalled.
5. Perform routine audits to check that these tools have not been reinstalled.

Conduct regular security audits
The owner/operator of the control system should consider performing an independent
security audit of the system, especially of third-party vendor access points and systems. The
owner/operator cannot solely depend on the views, options, and guidance of the
vendor/integrator that designed, developed, or sold the system. The goal of such an audit is

8/11

to identify and document system vulnerabilities, practices, and procedures that should be
eliminated to improve the cyber defensive posture, and ultimately prevent malicious cyber
actors from being able to cause their intended effects. Steps to consider during an audit
include the following:
1. Validate all connections (e.g., network, serial, modem, wireless, etc.).
2. Review system software patching procedures.
3. Confirm secure storage of gold copies (e.g., OS, firmware, patches, configurations,
etc.).
4. Verify removal from the system of all non-critical software, services, and tools.
5. Audit the full asset inventory.
6. Implement CISA ICS mitigations and best practices. [15] [16]
7. Monitor system logs and intrusion detection system (IDS) logs.

Implement a dynamic network environment
Static network environments provide malicious actors with persistent knowledge of the
system. A static network can provide cyber actors the opportunity to collect bits of
intelligence about the system over time, establish long-term accesses into the system, and
develop the tools and TTPs to affect the control system as intended.
While it may be unrealistic for the administrators of many OT/ICS environments to make
regular non-critical changes, owner/operators should consider periodically making
manageable network changes. A little change can go a long way to disrupt previously
obtained access by a malicious actor. Consider the following:
1. Deploy additional firewalls and routers from different vendors.
2. Modify IP address pools.
3. Replace outdated hardware (e.g., workstations, servers, printers, etc.).
4. Upgrade operating systems.
5. Install or upgrade commercially available security packages for vendor access points
and methodologies.
Planning these changes with significant forethought can help minimize the impact on network
operation.
Owner/operators should familiarize themselves with the risks to the system as outlined by
the product vendor. These may be described in manuals as the system using insecure
protocols for interoperability or certain configurations that may expose the system in
additional ways. Changes to the system to reduce these risks should be considered and
implemented when feasible.

Conclusion

9/11

The combination of integrated, simplified tools and remote accesses creates an environment
ripe for malicious actors to target control systems networks. New IT-enabled accesses
provide cyber actors with a larger attack surface into cyber-physical environments. It is vital
for OT/ICS defenders to anticipate the TTPs of cyber actors combining IT expertise with
engineering know-how. Defenders can employ the mitigations listed in this advisory to limit
unauthorized access, lock down tools and data flows, and deny malicious actors from
achieving their desired effects.
