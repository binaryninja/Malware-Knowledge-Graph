Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be
used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver's implants support C2
over Mutual TLS (mTLS), WireGuard, HTTP(S), and DNS and are dynamically compiled with
per-binary asymmetric encryption keys.
The server and client support MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Implants are supported on
MacOS, Windows, and Linux (and possibly every Golang compiler target but we've not
tested them all).
