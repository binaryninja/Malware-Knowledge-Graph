An attack perpetrated by REvil aka Sodinokibi ransomware gang against Managed Service
Providers (MSPs) and their clients was discovered on July 2. Some of the victims have
reportedly been compromised through a popular MSP software which led to encryption of
their customers. The total number of encrypted businesses could run into thousands.
REvil ransomware has been advertised on underground forums for three years and it is one
of the most prolific RaaS operations. According to an interview with the REvil operator, the
gang earned over $100 million from its operations in 2020. The group’s activity was first
observed in April 2019 after the shutdown of GandCrab, another now-defunct ransomware
gang. More details about that gang can be found in our articles Ransomware world in 2021:
who, how and why and Sodin ransomware exploits Windows vulnerability and processor
architecture.
In this latest case, the attackers deployed a malicious dropper via the PowerShell script,
which, in turn, was executed through the vendor’s agent:

This script disables Microsoft Defender features and then uses the certutil.exe utility to
decode a malicious executable (agent.exe) that drops a legitimate Microsoft binary
(MsMpEng.exe, an older version of Microsoft Defender) and malicious library (mpsvc.dll),
which is the REvil ransomware. This library is then loaded by the legitimate MsMpEng.exe by
utilizing the DLL side-loading technique (T1574.002).

Using our Threat Intelligence service, we observed more than 5,000 attack attempts in 22
countries by the time of writing.

Geography of attack attempts (based on KSN statistics)
REvil uses the Salsa20 symmetric stream algorithm for encrypting the content of files and
the keys for it with an elliptic curve asymmetric algorithm. Decryption of files affected by this
malware is impossible without the cybercriminals’ keys due to the secure cryptographic
scheme and implementation used in the malware.
Kaspersky products protect against this threat and detect it with the following names:
UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Gen.gen
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Sodin.gen
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Convagent.gen
PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic (with Behavior Detection)

The vendor whose software was reportedly compromised, issued a special advisory which is
being periodically updated.
To keep your company protected against ransomware 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky experts
recommend:
Not exposing remote desktop services (such as RDP) to public networks unless
absolutely necessary and always using strong passwords for them.
Promptly installing available patches for commercial VPN solutions providing access
for remote employees and acting as gateways in your network.
Always keeping software updated on all the devices you use to prevent ransomware
from exploiting vulnerabilities.

5/12

Focusing your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to
the internet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals’
connections. Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access it in an
emergency when needed. Use the latest Threat Intelligence information to stay aware
of actual TTPs used by threat actors.
Using solutions like Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response and the Kaspersky
Managed Detection and Response service which help to identify and stop attacks at
the early stages, before the attackers reach their main goals.
Protecting the corporate environment and educating your employees. Dedicated
training courses can help, such as those provided in the Kaspersky Automated Security
Awareness Platform. A free lesson on how to protect against ransomware attacks is
available here.
Using a reliable endpoint security solution such as Kaspersky Endpoint Security for
Business that is powered by exploit prevention, behavior detection and a remediation
engine that can roll back malicious actions. KESB also has self-defense mechanisms
that can prevent its removal by cybercriminals.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

10/12

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
