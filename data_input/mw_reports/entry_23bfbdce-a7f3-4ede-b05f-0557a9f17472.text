These days ransomware analysis gets a lot of coverage in commercial and public reports,
with vendors issuing dozens of ransomware-related publications each year. These reports
provide analysis on specific malware families or new samples, describe the activities of a
particular ransomware group, give general tips on how to prevent ransomware from working,
and so on. Malware analysts and security professionals can learn a lot from these reports,
but not much of the content has an immediate or practical use. With the release of the report
Common TTPs of modern ransomware, Kaspersky experts have taken a different approach.
We want to familiarize the reader with the different stages of ransomware deployment, how
cybercriminals use RATs and other tools across the various stages and what they aim to
achieve. The report also provides a visual guide to defending against targeted ransomware
attacks, using the most prolific groups as examples, and introduces the reader to the SIGMA
detection rules that we created.

What are the ransomware groups?
For the report we selected the eight most common ransomware groups:
1. Conti/Ryuk
2. Pysa
3. Clop (TA505)
4. Hive
5. Lockbit2.0
6. RagnarLocker
7. BlackByte
8. BlackCat
We analyzed in detail the attacks these groups perpetrated and employed techniques and
tactics described in MITRE ATT&CK to identify a large number of shared TTPs. By tracking
all the groups and detecting their attacks, we saw that the core techniques remain the same
throughout the cyber kill chain. The attack patterns revealed are not accidental because this
class of attack requires the hackers to go through certain stages, such as penetrating the
corporate network or victim’s computer, delivering malware, further discovery, account
hijacking, deleting shadow copies, removing backups and, finally, achieving their objectives.
To highlight the common components and TTPs shared by the ransomware groups across
different attack patterns, we’ve created a common cyber kill chain diagram. It provides a
visual representation of the techniques and tactics used by different ransomware operators.

Once the incident data relating to the ransomware groups has been collected, we can
identify the TTPs characteristic of each of them and then superimpose these onto the shared
cyber kill chain. The arrows indicate the sequence of specific techniques and the colours
mark the individual groups that have been known to deploy these techniques.

Whom is the report for?
This report is written for SOC analysts, threat hunting teams, cyberthreat intelligence
analysts, digital forensics specialists and cybersecurity specialists that are involved in the
incident response process and/or want to protect the environment they are responsible for
from targeted ransomware attacks. Our main goal is to help with understanding how
ransomware groups generally operate and how to defend against their attacks.
You can use this report as a book of knowledge on the main techniques used by ransomware
groups, for writing hunting rules and for auditing your security solutions.

The report contains
Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of eight modern ransomware groups:
Conti/Ryuk, Pysa, Clop (TA505), Hive, Lockbit2.0, RagnarLocker, BlackByte, and
BlackCat
A description of how different groups share more than half of the common components
and TTPs, with the core attack stages being executed identically across groups
A cyber kill chain diagram that combines the visible intersections and common
elements of the selected ransomware groups and makes it possible to predict the
threat actors’ next steps
A detailed analysis of each technique with examples of how they are being used by
various groups and a comprehensive list of mitigations
SIGMA rules based on described TTPs that can be applied to SIEM solutions

Reports

The SessionManager IIS backdoor
In early 2022, we investigated an IIS backdoor called SessionManager. It has been used
against NGOs, government, military and industrial organizations in Africa, South America,
Asia, Europe, Russia and the Middle East.

APT ToddyCat
ToddyCat is a relatively new APT actor responsible for multiple sets of attacks against highprofile entities in Europe and Asia. Its main distinctive signs are two formerly unknown tools
that we call ‘Samurai backdoor’ and ‘Ninja Trojan’.

WinDealer dealing on the side
We have discovered that malware dubbed WinDealer, spread by Chinese-speaking APT
actor LuoYu, has an ability to perform intrusions through a man-on-the-side attack.
