malicious actors and coordinate with private industry and the United States Government to prevent future intrusions and attacks.

RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise
Summary
The FBI first became aware of RagnarLocker in April 2020 and subsequently produced a FLASH
to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) at that time. This FLASH provides
updated and additional IOCs to supplement that report. As of January 2022, the FBI has
identified at least 52 entities across 10 critical infrastructure sectors affected by RagnarLocker
ransomware, including entities in the critical manufacturing, energy, financial services,
government, and information technology sectors. RagnarLocker ransomware actors work as
part of a ransomware family1, frequently changing obfuscation techniques to avoid detection
and prevention.

1 Ransomware family is a group of binaries associated to several ransomware variants or actor groups.

Technical Details
RagnarLocker is identified by the extension “.RGNR_<ID>,” where <ID> is a hash of the
computer’s NETBIOS name. The actors, identifying themselves as “RAGNAR_LOCKER,” leave a
.txt ransom note, with instructions on how to pay the ransom and decrypt the data.
RagnarLocker uses VMProtect, UPX, and custom packing algorithms and deploys within an
attacker’s custom Windows XP virtual machine on a target’s site.
Ragnar Locker uses Windows API GetLocaleInfoW to identify the location of the infected
machine. If the victim location is identified as "Azerbaijani," "Armenian," "Belorussian,"
"Kazakh," "Kyrgyz," "Moldavian," "Tajik," "Russian," "Turkmen," "Uzbek," "Ukrainian," or
"Georgian," the process terminates.
RagnarLocker checks for current infections to prevent multiple transform encryption of the
data, potentially corrupting it. The binary gathers the unique machine GUID, operating system
product name, and user name currently running the process. This data is sent through a
custom hashing algorithm to generate a unique identifier: <HashedMachineGuid><HashedWindowsProductName>-<HashedUser>-<HashedComputerName><HashedAllDataTogether>.
RagnarLocker identifies all attached hard drives using Windows APIs: CreateFileW,
DeviceIoControl, GetLogicalDrives, and SetVolumeMountPointA. The ransomware assigns a
drive letter to any volumes not assigned a logical drive letter and makes them accessible.
These newly attached volumes are later encrypted during the final stage of the binary.
RagnarLocker iterates through all running services and terminates services commonly used by
managed service providers to remotely administer networks. The malware then attempts to
silently delete all Volume Shadow Copies, preventing user recovery of encrypted files, using
two different methods:



>vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
>wmic.exe.shadowcopy.delete

Lastly, RagnarLocker encrypts all available files of interest. Instead of choosing which files to
encrypt, RagnarLocker chooses which folders it will not encrypt. Taking this approach allows
the computer to continue to operate “normally” while the malware encrypts files with known
and unknown extensions containing data of value to the victim. For example, if the logical
drive being processed is the C: drive, the malware does not encrypt files in the following
folders:


Windows

Information Requested:
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden
adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the
distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee
a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands when businesses are faced with
an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders,
employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the
ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so
provides investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware
attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.
The FBI may seek the following information:
SHORT TERM ITEMS



Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage
device. This information should not be accessible from the compromised network.

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE


Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion
from the system where the data resides.



Use multi-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remote access
services.



Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.



Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login
credentials and change passwords and settings.



Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.



Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor
remote access/RDP logs.



Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with
least privilege in mind.



Implement network segmentation.

Additional Resources
For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, go to

Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the Government’s
official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.
CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered
set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and
recover from a ransomware incident.
CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations
assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By requesting
these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack
