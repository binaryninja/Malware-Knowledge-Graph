Using Vanilla Rat:
Setting The Server Up: To get started you must have at least one open port that you do not
use with other applications. The default port is 1604. You must also have a dynamic dns
address which you can get from https://no-ip.com/. To get started build a client by clicking the
builder button in the main settings, please note the client tag is how you will know which
client is which (assuming you are not using the program maliciously), and the name is the
output exe file. Enter your DNS address and port into their designated fields. If you do not
know what the update interval is you can leave it as is. Once you are done click build. Next
set the settings up, fill your port in the port field if you changed it, if you do not know what the
update interval is you can leave it as is. You can now hit the start server button and the
server will now listen for connections.
Client Options: Once a client is connected you can select the client and right click on the
client to bring up a menu of options, or you can select the client and click start remote
desktop if you wish to start the remote desktop. Some client options have special functions
as listed below:
Process Manager (Get Running Applications): Right click to bring up options for
refreshing and closing processes.
File Browser: Right click to bring up options for downloading, uploading, refrshing, and
deleting files. Note that for uploading you may drag and drop a file into the browser to
upload it into the directory it is currently in.
Clipboard Text: Note you do not have to close the dialog if you want to get another
copy of the currently copied text on the client. Just hit Get Clipboard Text again and the
dialog will automatically update.
