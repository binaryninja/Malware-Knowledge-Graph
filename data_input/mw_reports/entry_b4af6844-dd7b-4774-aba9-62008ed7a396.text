Update 12.01.22: The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
issued a joint advisory on Cuba ransomware, listing this BlackBerry blog as a
resource. See Advisory.

Summary
The threat actor known as RomCom is running a series of new attack campaigns that take
advantage of the brand power of SolarWinds, KeePass, and PDF Technologies. The BlackBerry
Threat Research and Intelligence Team uncovered the campaigns while analyzing network artifacts
unearthed during our recent report on RomComRAT, which was targeting Ukrainian military
institutions through spoofed versions of Advanced IP Scanner software.
In our latest discovery, our team found RomCom impersonating the following products in their
campaigns: SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, KeePass Open-Source
Password Manager, and PDF Reader Pro.
While Ukraine still appears to be the primary target of this campaign, we believe some Englishspeaking countries are being targeted as well, including the United Kingdom. This is based on the
terms of service (TOS) of two of the malicious websites and the SSL certificates of a newly created
command-and-control (C2).

RomCom Threat Actor Abuses KeePass and SolarWinds to Target Ukraine and Potentially the United Kingdom

Given the geography of the targets and the current geopolitical situation, it's unlikely that the
RomCom RAT threat actor is cybercrime-motivated.

Attack Vector
In preparation for an attack, the RomCom threat actor performs the following simplified scheme:
scraping the original legitimate HTML code from the vendor to spoof, registering a malicious
domain similar to the legitimate one, Trojanizing a legitimate application, uploading a malicious
bundle to the decoy website, deploying targeted phishing emails to the victims, or in some
instances, using additional infector vectors, which we will go into in more detail below.

RomCom Weaponization
RomCom SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor Campaign
Take a look at the two screen shots below to see how the real SolarWinds NPM site and the spoofed
site compare.

The deployment of this attack is through a Trojanized version of the SolarWinds Network
Performance Monitoring (NPM) application. While downloading a free trial from the spoofed
SolarWinds site, a legitimate registration form appears. If filled out, real SolarWinds sales
personnel might contact the victim to follow up on the product trial. That technique misleads the
victim into believing that the recently downloaded and installed application is completely
legitimate. Instead, the victim has unknowingly downloaded a dropper for the malicious RomCom
remote access Trojan (RAT).

investigation into this threat actor. It is important to note that the legitimate file is digitally signed
by “SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC.”
The “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” contains three embedded x64 files in the resource section:
X86 – Contains “c:\users\123\source\repos\ins_asi\win32\release\instlib.pdb,” the same
PDB path we have previously seen in the “setup.exe” files.
X87 – A clean, digitally signed, SolarWinds Orion installer.
X88 – RomCom RAT dropper. This DLL invokes “rundll32.exe” and runs the “fwdTst”
export, which drops x64 RomCom RAT in “C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\winver.dll”
location.

KeePass RomCom Campaign
On Nov. 1, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team made another discovery. The
RomCom team created a new attack campaign abusing a popular password keeper called KeePass.
When someone downloads the application from the fake but legitimate-looking KeePass website,
the attacker drops a malicious bundle onto the victim’s machine with the name "KeePass-2.52."

Figure 6 – Contents of the malicious archive
As shown in the screenshot above, two malicious files are contained in the KeePass-2.52.zip file:
Setup.exe – The file that launches the RomCom RAT dropper: PDB
C:\Users\123\source\repos\ins_asi\Win32\Release\setup.pdb
hlpr.dat is a RomCom RAT dropper.
Our team followed the RomCom Netflows and uncovered both spoofed KeePass and PDF Reader
Pro sites in Ukrainian language. Both of these spoofed websites host their terms of service pages on
the same URL and imply the software providers are hosted by UK companies.

Netflow analysis by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team also led to the discovery of a
new C2 registered on Oct. 27, utilizing SSL certificates that emulate UK ownership:
Issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=Harmondsworth, O=British Government,
OU=dgtlocean.com, CN=ca dgtlocean.com/emailAddress=ca(at)mail.com Issuer: C=GB,

Conclusions
The RomCom threat actor is actively deploying new campaigns targeting victims in Ukraine and
English-speaking targets worldwide. Based on the TOS, it is possible that victims in the United
Kingdom are a new target, while Ukraine continues to be the main focus.
It’s important to note:
The Trojanized bundles that the threat actor built do not indicate the mentioned vendors
were compromised
The legitimate companies are not involved in any attack

RomCom Threat Actor Abuses KeePass and SolarWinds to Target Ukraine and Potentially the United Kingdom

The threat actors created fake websites to mimic the real ones
RomCom RAT, Cuba Ransomware, and Industrial Spy have an apparent connection. Industrial Spy
is a relatively new ransomware group that emerged in April 2022. However, given the targets'
geography and characteristics, combined with the current geopolitical situation, it's unclear if the
real motivation of the RomCom threat actor is purely cybercriminal in nature.
