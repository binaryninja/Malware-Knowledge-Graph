Tactics, Techniques, and Indicators of Compromise Associated
with Hello Kitty/FiveHands Ransomware
Summary
The FBI first observed Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware in January 2021. Hello
Kitty/FiveHands actors aggressively apply pressure to victims typically using the double
extortion technique. In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not
pay the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attack on the victim company’s public facing website. Hello Kitty/FiveHands actors
demand varying ransom payments in Bitcoin (BTC) that appear tailored to each victim,
commensurate with their assessed ability to pay it. If no ransom is paid, the threat
actors will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data
broker.

Technical Details
Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware uses compromised credentials or known
vulnerabilities in SonicWall products (CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-202120022, CVE-2021-20023). Once inside the network, the threat actor will use publicly
available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando, or
PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and
Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption.

Information Requested
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may
embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal
actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Paying the
ransom also does not guarantee a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI
understands when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will
evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.
Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the ransom, the FBI
urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so provides
investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware
attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.
The FBI may seek the following information:












Recovered executable files
Live memory (RAM) capture
Images of infected systems
Malware samples
IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious
Email addresses of the attackers
A copy of the ransom note
Ransom amount
Bitcoin wallets used by the attackers
Bitcoin wallets used to pay the ransom
Post-incident forensic reports

Recommended Mitigations
 Back-up critical data offline.
 Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or
storage device.
 Secure your back-ups and ensure all data is not accessible for modification or
deletion from the system where the data resides.

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE /
 Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remote
access services.
 Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN
login credentials and change passwords and settings, if applicable.
 Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.
 Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.
 Review the following additional resources:
o CISA’s analysis report and malware analysis report on FiveHands
ransomware provide analysis of a threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and
procedures used in a successful cyberattack; indicators of compromise;
and recommended mitigations to protect against, detect, and respond to
potential FiveHands ransomware attacks.
o The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering
and Remediating Malicious Activity provides additional guidance when
hunting or investigating a network and common mistakes to avoid in
incident handling.
o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State
Information Sharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers
additional best practices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a
ransomware attack.
o StopRansomware.gov is the US Government’s official one-stop location for
resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.
If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend
the following actions:
 Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and
disable the computer’s networking capabilities, including wireless and Bluetooth.
Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired or
wireless.
 Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove
from the network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any
additional computers or devices that share a network with the infected
computer(s), even if they have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. If
possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and
TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE /
devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have
been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and
computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of
partially encrypted files by specialists.
 Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secured. If
possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free
of malware.
