ABSTRACT
In the past two years, BlackEnergy has become one of the top
malware families of interest to system administrators with the
responsibility of protecting the networks of potential targets, to
security researchers who have the family in their sights, and also
to the media – both technical and mainstream.
BlackEnergy recently made the headlines again after we
discovered that it was used in cyber attacks against electricity
distribution companies, which resulted in massive power outages
in Ukraine in December 2015.
But cyber attacks using the BlackEnergy malware are nothing
new. We first discussed the malware and the perpetrators behind
it (later nicknamed the Sandworm Team) during our talk at the
Virus Bulletin conference in 2014, where we discussed how it
transformed from a regular piece of crimeware for DDoS attacks
and online banking fraud into a complex piece of malware for
espionage and industrial sabotage. Now we are publishing our
most comprehensive paper on the cybercrime operations based
on our three years of research.
One of the main reasons why the BlackEnergy attacks have
grabbed so much attention is because they were – and still are –
used in the midst of a tense geopolitical situation in Ukraine. In
addition to electricity distribution companies, the targets in that
country have included state institutions, news media
organizations, airports, and railway companies. Ukrainian
officials were quick to point an accusing finger at Russia, and
many others – including security companies – followed with
similar allegations. The power grid compromise has become
known as the first-of-its-kind confirmed cyber warfare attack
affecting civilians.
In our paper we share insights about the discoveries and our
following research, including previously unpublished details. We
attempt to separate facts from speculations, reality from hype,
and clearly state what we know and don’t know – both in regard
to attribution, as well as other disputed details of the attacks.

INTRODUCTION
The BlackEnergy malware has evolved significantly from its
initial version first seen in 2007, which has little in common with
the samples in the wild (and in the headlines) in 2016. Over the
years, the malware family has been used for (petty) cybercrime,
cyber espionage, and most recently, cyber sabotage.
It is important to point out these technical aspects, since there
have been many reports in recent years about ‘the group’ behind
BlackEnergy and the origin of the malware. The initial version of

BlackEnergy had Russian origins, was sold on underground
forums, and its source code was leaked. Version 2 of the malware
(2010) was a complete code rewrite that introduced a modular
architecture. Since then, it has been used for a wide range of
purposes. We know little about the perpetrators behind the
current BlackEnergy attacks, but as the malware family has been
used in common cybercrime attacks simultaneously with targeted
attacks, it is likely that there are several groups in possession of
the trojan. In this paper, we will focus on the recent targeted
attacks.
We discussed the evolution of the malware, technical details, as
well as some of the cyber espionage attacks conducted with it
against state organizations in Ukraine, in our 2014 talk at the
Virus Bulletin conference [1] and in a blog post [2].
The attackers continued to be active in 2015, and their activity
culminated in the widely publicized attacks against the Ukrainian
power grid at the end of that year.
Following our initial discovery that attackers using the
BlackEnergy malware were responsible for the massive power
outages [3], several reports have been released that explain the
chain of events leading up to the blackout [4, 5]. It was a
well-planned operation that took several months of
reconnaissance to prepare.
The aim of this paper is to provide additional details about the
modus operandi of the BlackEnergy APT group and to add
previously undisclosed context.

HISTORY AND FOCUS ON UKRAINE
The BlackEnergy group has been focused on Ukraine ever since
we first observed the trojan being used in targeted attacks. We
have collected various documents containing Microsoft Word
exploits that were used by this group.

All of these examples use Ukraine-related topics in their
filenames or in decoy-documents. Moreover, there are
indications that some of these files contained exploits for
security flaws that were unpatched at that time (zero-days).
In May 2014, this group used spear-phishing emails against
various targets, including elements of critical infrastructure such
as energy companies. In these emails attackers impersonated
government entities. Figure 1 shows an example of a spearphishing email with a forged sender address. The attackers were
impersonating the Ministry of Industrial Policy of Ukraine and

the text of these emails explained that recipients should change
their passwords if they were contained in a list of passwords
attached to the email. The attached zip archive actually
contained the BlackEnergy executable.

BlackEnergy group.

In the beginning of August 2014 the group started to send
spear-phishing emails with a PowerPoint presentation attached.
The PowerPoint file was named ‘zdacha_krovi.ppsx’ (Ukrainian
for ‘blood donation’). The PowerPoint presentation included
one of the first exploits of the CVE-2014-4114 vulnerability. At
that time, the vulnerability had not been patched.

interfaces (HMIs) of industrial control systems [7]. The alert
warned that users of GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin
WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC had been targeted by this
cyber threat actor.
These findings demonstrated the interest of the BlackEnergy
group in Ukraine and industrial control systems.

ATTACKS IN 2015
For some of the victims, attacks in 2015 started in February. At
that time the attackers sent out spear-phishing messages, but
surprisingly these messages didn’t contain any malicious
objects. Instead, the emails contained HTML content with a link
to a .PNG file located on a remote server, so that the attackers
would receive a notification that the email had been delivered
and opened by the target. The name of the .PNG file was unique
to each recipient and represented the victim’s base64 encoded
email address. (It should be noted that not all email clients load
remote content by default.)
The attached PowerPoint presentation was not malicious, but it
also contained external pictures. Once opened, PowerPoint
displays a warning and does not load such pictures by default.

Figure 2: Decoy text displayed by zero-day exploit sample used
by the BlackEnergy group in August 2014.

We have a conjecture that by sending these spear-phishing
emails, the attackers intended to find out how many people read
the emails, and how many of them actually open attachments.

Ten days later the attackers started using a new PowerPoint file,
named ‘spiski_deputatov_done.ppsx’, in a much larger spearphishing campaign [1]. That’s when it was spotted by ESET and
iSIGHT Partners and reported to Microsoft by both companies.
The vulnerability, in the Windows Object Linking and
Embedding (OLE) package, allowed attackers to perform
remote code execution on the target system. The PowerPoint
package contained two embedded OLE objects, each with a
remote path where the resource was located. The final payload
was located on a remote SMB share. Other files were also
located on the SMB share, including files which were possibly
used against users of a SCADA platform called the
CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite [6].
In late October 2014, the Department of Homeland Security’s
(DHS) Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) issued an alert warning stating that the
BlackEnergy group was targeting the human-machine

malicious .JAR file, which tried to launch the BlackEnergy
dropper. This approach relied on the assumption that the victim
had Java Runtime Installed.
Figure 5: HTML content of email with PNG file on remote
server.
During the next few months, the attackers were sending
spear-phishing emails that actually contained malicious
attachments – specifically Microsoft Office files with malicious
macros, and PowerPoint files. Once such a PowerPoint file was
opened, it displayed a security warning to the victim about
potentially malicious content. If the user allowed this content,
then PowerPoint made an attempt to create and execute a

The Microsoft Office files used in the 2015 attacks had different
content and layout; in some cases, attackers used a template that
was customized for a particular victim. Previously unpublished
examples of such malicious Excel files are shown in Figures 6
and 7.

BLACKENERGY ATTACKS ON THE ENERGY
SECTOR
On 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy
malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in
different regions of Ukraine. This cyber attack against three
energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian
government [8] and by the DHS [9].
While some security experts are skeptical about any
involvement of the BlackEnergy malware in the power outage
incident, we should say that this malware was indeed detected
in Ukrainian energy companies. It is likely that attackers didn’t
use the BlackEnergy malware to cause the outage itself, but the
malware was definitely used for the preparation of power outage
attacks.

Figure 6: The Microsoft Excel document with a malicious macro
that was used against Ukrainian media companies.

We are aware of a case in which attackers used existing tools
within the environment, specifically the Radmin application.
Radmin is client-server software that allows computers to be
controlled remotely; it’s often used by network administrators to
fix various issues. The attackers gained access to an operator’s
computer using this tool and, ‘on behalf of operator’, performed
operations that caused a power outage. Since this software has a
verbose log file, the coherence between the time of incoming
Radmin connections to the operator’s machine and the time of
outage strengthens the assumption that Radmin software was
used.
In some reports there was information about a telephone DDoS
attack (also sometimes referred to as a ‘telephone flood’ by
cybercriminals) against one energy company [10]. This tactic
has been used in the past by cybercriminals to hide a cyber heist
or major hack [11]. In fact, there are individuals on underground
forums who are offering such services to anyone for US$50 per
day, which means that the victim of such an attack would
receive a huge number of incoming calls for a whole day and it
would cost the attacker only US$50 (see Figure 8).

TACTICS, TOOLS AND PROCEDURES
In this section, we will examine the different tactics, tools and
procedures used by the BlackEnergy group at each stage of the
attack.

Entry point and initial phase

that may have been used against the Ukrainian railway
company.

As explained before, the BlackEnergy group makes heavy use
of spear-phishing emails. The attached file that leads to
compromise takes a variety of forms; we have seen the use of
Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA
macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits

for Microsoft Word, PowerPoint files, including zero-day
exploits, and straightforward executable binaries.
In addition, there is a report by the Ukrainian security company
CyS Centrum that states that the BlackEnergy group
compromised a web server that was connected to the company’s
local network. Afterwards, attackers were able to move onto the
local network via the compromised web server [12].
The BlackEnergy group may use different approaches for
spear-phishing attacks. In some cases, we observed the attackers
mass-mailing spear-phishing messages to a number of
employees in targeted organizations. Alternatively, attackers may
select just a few email addresses and target those addresses only.
Since many victims in corporate environments don’t have
administrator privileges, the attackers introduced the
BlackEnergy3 (mini or light) version in 2013. The major
difference between BlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 is that the
latter was designed to work without administrator privileges.
Other differences between these versions are less significant. We
are aware of an analysis of BlackEnergy3 malware that
inaccurately claims that the malware is able to start system
services or works as a network sniffer. However, BlackEnergy3
does not have these features simply because it was not designed
to have them. The researchers confused BlackEnergy itself with
its wrapper, which was used to disguise one of BlackEnergy’s
components.
While monitoring this threat, we observed another interesting
detail. When the attackers are not familiar with the security
measures implemented in the victim’s network, or when they
are attempting to attack the victim for the first time, they prefer
to use HTTP rather than HTTPS, for communication with C&C
servers. However, the HTTP communication is still encrypted
with the RC4 algorithm. Such behaviour could be explained by
the fact that some security solutions are able to notify a system
administrator about suspicious HTTPS traffic in the network. If

4

VIRUS BULLETIN CONFERENCE OCTOBER 2016

there were no such issue, then the attacker would switch to
HTTPS communication later.

Reconnaissance and lateral movement
As with a number of modern, sophisticated threats, the
BlackEnergy malware has a modular architecture. The core
component of BlackEnergy does not provide the attackers with
much functionality: it is able merely to download and execute a
binary or shell command, uninstall itself, modify internal
settings, or load additional modules.
The functionality of BlackEnergy can dramatically be extended
with additional modules. These modules are stored in encrypted
form in a separate file, which can be referred to as a plug-incontainer. Thus, analysing such containers can reveal interesting
details about new functionality or other changes.
During our research in 2014 we discovered and analysed 14
different BlackEnergy plug-ins [1], while in other publications
on BlackEnergy activity, researchers revealed 17 plug-ins [13].
The difference could be explained by a focus on different
botnets. BlackEnergy operators don’t push all the possible
plug-ins at once; they use only those plug-ins that they need at
that time.
In 2015, we collected and analysed 20 containers from various
victims, including energy companies. Five of those containers
were empty. The malware has a command which allows an
operator to modify or delete entries in a container.
Table 2 lists the BlackEnergy plug-ins used in attacks in 2015.
Since some of the plug-in containers were recovered from
computers in energy companies in Ukraine, we expected to
discover new plug-ins that potentially could be used in attacks
against SCADA systems. However, nothing like that was found.
Moreover, if the PE timestamps are genuine, it means that the
attackers hadn’t even updated plug-ins since 2013 and 2014.

Purpose

File system operations,
gathering information
about the victim’s system

Table 2: BlackEnergy modules used in 2015.

Perhaps the existing functionality was enough for their
purposes.
When attackers get into the local network, they start to gather
information about the system and network perimeter. Initial
reconnaissance is made by the FS plug-in. This module collects
a great deal of valuable information for attackers: Windows
version, current privileges, installed applications, running
processes, proxy settings, and the output of system utilities such
as systeminfo, ipconfig, netstat, route, and tracert. In addition,
this module may parse and collect information from the
Windows System Event Log. Specifically, it collects the dates
and times of system starts, reboots and shutdowns. This
information reveals to attackers the victim’s work habits, for
example whether the employee turns his computer off over the
weekend, or at what time he or she comes to work and turns the
computer on.
With help from the password stealer and key logger plug-ins,
attackers are able to collect login credentials to various
applications such as browsers, email clients and passwords
stored in the Windows Credentials Store. Once the BlackEnergy
operators have obtained valid credentials, they are able to move
to the other computers in the network. This is done by use of the
VS module. This module has embedded PsExec within it – a
legitimate Microsoft tool that allows the execution of programs
on remote systems.
The attackers may explore the network perimeter using their
SCAN module, which allows them to map the network and scan
hosts for open ports. Interestingly, it seems that this module was
not efficient enough for the attackers. We have seen them
making use of the Nmap network scanner version 6.47. The
scanner tool’s executable was located in the C:\Windows\Temp\
Syslog\ directory and disguised as the Microsoft svchost.exe
executable (see Figure 9).
The ultimate goal for any APT is to gain access to the Active
Directory server and obtain domain administrator privileges.
The BlackEnergy group is no exception, and to do that they
used Mimikatz. This is a tool that can retrieve Windows account
passwords and hashes from memory. We have seen that
attackers were trying to download the Mimikatz tool right away
from the GitHub site. Since Mimikatz requires local

component.

administrator or system privileges in order to perform certain
actions, attackers need to obtain such privileges beforehand. We
didn’t observe any use of local privilege escalation (LPE)
exploits by this group, but we don’t exclude that possibility.
Once the attackers have gained the required credentials, they
can infect key network nodes using BlackEnergy2:
specifically, this group is interested in infecting Windows
servers. BlackEnergy2 exists in the form of a kernel-mode
driver, which makes it harder for network administrators to
discover the compromise. Current versions of the Windows
Server operating system don’t exist for 32-bit platforms, and
for 64-bit platforms Microsoft driver signing policy requires
kernel-mode drivers to have a valid digital signature [14].
Previously, the BlackEnergy2 dropper bypassed this security
measure by enabling the TESTSIGNING boot configuration
option [15]. However, the infected system still needed to be
rebooted in order to start the BlackEnergy driver. This
unplanned reboot of the Windows server could raise suspicion.
To solve the reboot issue, in 2015 the attackers started to use a
tool called DSEFix [16]. This is an open-source tool that
exploits CVE-2008-3431, a vulnerability in the legitimate
VirtualBox driver, in order to disable the driver signature
check. Since DSEFix disables this check only until the next
reboot, the attackers made a custom version of DSEFix that
also modifies boot configuration data (BCD) in order to enable
TESTSIGNING mode.
Another tool that we discovered in BlackEnergy’s 2015 arsenal
is detected by ESET products as the Win32/SSHBearDoor.A
trojan [17]. This is a backdoored version of a legitimate SSH
server called Dropbear SSH. The attackers used this tool to
regain access to the server, in the event that the BlackEnergy
malware was discovered and deleted.
Sometimes the BlackEnergy group may insert their implant on
computers that are used as part of critical infrastructure and wait
until they need it, ‘just in case’. In such cases the attackers are
trying to stay under the radar: they don’t exfiltrate large amounts
of data to C&C servers or even attempt to perform lateral
movement.

BLACKENERGY – WHAT WE REALLY KNOW... CHEREPANOV & LIPOVSKY

We observed that attackers may use a unique C&C server for
each infected computer in the same network. This tactic has the
potential to allow attackers to stay longer on the network, since
even if infection is discovered on a particular computer, other
infections may remain unnoticed.

Final phase
In 2015, attackers used the KillDisk component as the final
phase of attacks. This destructive component deletes important
files on the disk drive, empties Windows event logs and, to
make the system unbootable, rewrites the first sectors on
physical drives. The first use of this component was
documented by CERT-UA against media companies [18]. In
the case described by CERT-UA, it is unclear whether this
component was used to cover tracks or whether it was the
original intent of the attackers.

Use of other malware
On 20 January 2016, ESET identified a new attempted attack on
energy companies in Ukraine [19]. The attackers used exactly
the same infection vector as in previous attacks: a
spear-phishing email with an attached Excel document
containing a malicious VBA macro. This time, however, instead
of using BlackEnergy, the attackers used different malware. The
first-stage payload was a simple trojan downloader, which
connected to and downloaded a second-stage payload from a
compromised Ukrainian server. The second-stage payload was a
backdoor, written in Python, called Gcat. This backdoor is open
source and freely available to everyone on GitHub.
Why do we conclude that the same group was behind this
attack? We know because the spear-phishing emails were sent
from the same server as was used by the BlackEnergy group
[20]. In addition, the attackers’ email used the same notification
technique, with a PNG image, as described above.
The fact that this group is able to use different types of malware
inspired us to look for similar cases in the past. We found one
such case, but there is no proven link to the BlackEnergy group
as seen in the 20 January 2016 case. However, we still believe
that it was used by the same group.
As before, the initial infection vector was an Excel document
containing a malicious VBA macro. The document was named
Загальний довідник ДП АМПУ на 23 07 15.xls, which
translates from Ukrainian as the General Directory of State
Enterprise «Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority» on 23 07 15. Since
this document uses the topic of sea ports, and we are aware that
the BlackEnergy group is known to attack such critical
infrastructure components, it is fair to assume that this
document was used against sea port companies or companies in
some way associated with them (see Figure 10).
The VBA macro code in this document is very similar to a
macro used by BlackEnergy in delivering documents. Once the
macro is activated, this document creates the file vba_macro.exe
in %TEMP% and executes it afterwards. The executable is an
obfuscated .NET binary, which simply downloads a
second-stage payload. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say
now what was downloaded when the server was active.

Figure 10: The Excel document with a malicious macro, which
is possibly intended for use against Ukrainian sea ports.
The document was saved on 23 July 2015 and the payload
dropped was detected by our products in the fourth quarter of
2015. We don’t know how successful this attempted attack was.

CONCLUSION
The perpetrators behind BlackEnergy have caused the first
documented act of cyber sabotage against a mass civilian
population. That fact by itself makes the threat and threat actors
interesting but, as our research has showed, there are also many
other noteworthy details that have come to light over the years,
for example, the use of the PowerPoint zero-day exploit
CVE-2014-4114.
The BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine have been taking place at
the time of an armed conflict, which makes it an exceptionally
sensitive issue. Given the geopolitical situation in the region and
the types of victims targeted in the attacks (high-value state and
government organizations but also critical infrastructure –
power grid, railway, airport, news media, and others) political
motives are very likely. Ukrainian officials were quick to point
an accusing finger at Russia, and many others – including
security companies – followed with similar allegations. Since
attribution in the cyber world is always tricky, we can neither
confirm nor deny this. In fact, it is somewhat disturbing when
speculations are presented as facts without hard evidence.
Whoever stands behind the BlackEnergy attacks, we can expect
to see more in the future. We will continue monitoring the
situation for new developments.
