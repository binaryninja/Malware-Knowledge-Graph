Tropic Trooper Goes Mobile With Titan Surveillanceware
blog.lookout.com/titan-mobile-threat

Lookout researchers have recently observed cybercriminals evolving the way they operate to
reflect the multitude of platforms people now use to access information: you may read and
triage email on a smartphone, switch to a laptop to crank out some work, then flip over to a
tablet to catch up on social media or watch a video. To the attackers, it's a numbers game.
The more devices they can reach, the more likely they are to compromise a target. Given the
rise of mobile productivity, this means that we are seeing a growing number of attackers add
mobile capabilities to their toolkits.
The latest threat to follow this trend is Titan, a family of sophisticated Android
surveillanceware apps surfaced by Lookout's automated analysis that, based on command
and control infrastructure, is linked to the same actors behind Operation Tropic Trooper.
Tropic Trooper is a long running campaign, first reported in 2016, that executed targeted
desktop attacks against enterprises and military units in Taiwan and the Philippines. All
Lookout customers are protected from Titan.

Capabilities
Titan usually comes with busybox and various native libraries that provide a range of
functionality, from automated gathering of a user's data to being able to execute attacker
specified instructions as superuser. Over time, Titan has evolved considerably with a distinct

1/7

trend of malicious code shifting first from Java to native libraries, then moving into second
stage components. Analysis of Titan variants found that they contained the following
capabilities:
Retrieve call history
Retrieve text messages
Retrieve contact information
Retrieve a list of Installed packages
Track device location
Take a photo with the device camera when a user is first present or when instructed by
an attacker
Record all calls or only calls to attacker specified numbers
Block text messages to attacker specified numbers
Take a screenshot
Send a text message
Execute attacker specified commands as root
Upload specific files
Download attacker specified files

Titan hasn't been seen to trojanize legitimate applications and doesn't contain any legitimate
functionality. The authors of Titan have instead opted to simply use the icon of a legitimate
app. Application icons used included:
Zalo - a vietnamese Messaging Application,
91 - an unofficial Chinese App Store that was bought by Baidu in 2013 for 1.9 billion,
YY - a popular Chinese social network,
Renren - formerly Xiaonei Network, this is a social network primarily used by Chinese
college students,
58 - an online Chinese marketplace,
WeChat - a popular Chinese messaging app, and
FloatingMenu - an application for handling shortcuts and gestures.

Infrastructure
Several domains and IP addresses associated to this family are no longer live however
further research is being conducted into 108.61.xxx.xxx which, at the time of writing, is live,
running PHP, and exposing information that may provide additional leads. Some Titan
variants have been seen to iterate through a list of possible command and control servers
when beaconing out. Domains and IPs that Titan has, or is currently, using are listed below.

As a family that is actively being improved, and given its links to targeted attacks against
enterprises and defense institutions, Lookout is continuing to track Titan variants, associated
server infrastructure, and geographical regions where they're being deployed.
