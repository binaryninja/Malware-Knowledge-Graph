January 14, 2021

UPDATE: Microsoft continues to work with partners and customers to expand our
knowledge of the threat actor behind the nation-state cyberattacks that compromised
the supply chain of SolarWinds and impacted multiple other organizations. Microsoft
previously used ‘Solorigate’ as the primary designation for the actor, but moving
forward, we want to place appropriate focus on the actors behind the sophisticated
attacks, rather than one of the examples of malware used by the actors. Microsoft
Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the actor behind the attack against
SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, and related
components as NOBELIUM. As we release new content and analysis, we will use
NOBELIUM to refer to the actor and the campaign of attacks.
Even as investigations into the sophisticated attack known as Solorigate are still underway,
details and insights about the tools, patterns, and methods used by the attackers point to
steps that organizations can take to improve their defenses against similar attacks.
Solorigate is a cross-domain compromise—comprehensive visibility and coordinated defense
are critical in responding to the attack. The same unified end-to-end protection is key to
increasing resilience and preventing such attacks.

This blog is a guide for security administrators using Microsoft 365 Defender and
Azure Defender to identify and implement security configuration and posture
improvements that harden enterprise environments against Solorigate’s attack
patterns.
This blog will cover:
The recommendations on this blog are based on our current analysis of the Solorigate
attack. While this threat continues to evolve and investigations continue to unearth more
information, we’re publishing these recommendations to help customers apply improvements
today. To get the latest information and guidance from Microsoft, visit
https://aka.ms/solorigate. Security operations and incident response teams looking for
detection coverage and hunting guidance can refer to https://aka.ms/detect_solorigate.

What the Solorigate attack tells us about the state of cyberattacks
Solorigate is a complex, multi-stage attack that involved the use of advanced attacker
techniques across multiple environments and multiple domains to compromise high-profile
targets. To perpetrate this sophisticated attack, the attackers performed the steps below,
which are discussed in detail in this blog:
1. Compromise a legitimate binary belonging to the SolarWinds Orion Platform through a
supply-chain attack
2. Deploy a backdoor malware on devices using the compromised binary to allow
attackers to remotely control affected devices
3. Use the backdoor access on compromised devices to steal credentials, escalate
privileges, and move laterally across on-premises environments to gain the ability to
create SAML tokens
4. Access cloud resources to search for accounts of interest and exfiltrate emails

Figure 1. High-level end-to-end Solorigate attack chain
As its intricate attack chain shows, Solorigate represents a modern cyberattack conducted by
highly motivated actors who have demonstrated they won’t spare resources to get to their
goal. The collective intelligence about this attack shows that, while hardening individual
security domains is important, defending against today’s advanced attacks necessitates a
holistic understanding of the relationship between these domains and how a compromise in
one environment can be a jump-off point to another.
The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint threat analytics reports published in Microsoft 365
security center enable customers to trace such cross-domain threats by providing end-to-end
analysis of critical threats. In the case of Solorigate, Microsoft researchers have so far
published two threat analytics reports, which continue to be updated as additional
information becomes available:
Sophisticated actor attacks FireEye, which provides information about the FireEye
breach and compromised red-team tools
Solorigate supply chain attack, which provides a detailed analysis of the SolarWinds
supply chain compromise
In addition to providing detailed descriptions of the attack, TTPs, indicators of compromise
(IoCs), and the all-up impact of the threat to the organization, the threat analytics reports
empower security administrators to review organizational resilience against the attack and
apply recommended mitigations. These mitigations and other recommended best practices
are discussed in the succeeding sections. Customers who don’t have access to threat
analytics can refer to a publicly available customer guidance.

Protecting devices and servers
The attackers behind Solorigate gain initial access to target networks by activating backdoor
codes inserted into the compromised SolarWinds binary. Protecting devices against this
stage of the attack can help prevent the more damaging impact of the latter stages.

Ensure full visibility into your device estate by onboarding them to Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint
In the ongoing comprehensive research into the complex Solorigate attack, one thing
remains certain: full in-depth visibility into your devices is key to gaining insights on security
posture, risk, and potential attack activity. Make sure all your devices are protected and
monitored by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

Endpoint, showing onboarded devices compared to the total number of devices managed via
Endpoint Manager

Identify and patch vulnerable SolarWinds Orion applications
The Solorigate attack uses vulnerable versions of the SolarWinds Orion application so we
recommend that you identify devices running vulnerable versions of the application and
ensure they are updated to the latest version. The threat analytics report uses insights from
threat and vulnerability management to identify such devices. On the Mitigations page in
Threat analytics, you can view the number of devices exposed to vulnerability ID TVM-20200002, which we added specifically to help with Solorigate investigations:

Figure 4. The Threat analytics Mitigations page shows information on exposed devices
The new vulnerability ID TVM-2020-0002 was added to the threat and vulnerability
management Weaknesses page in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint so you can easily find
exposed devices that have vulnerable SolarWinds software components installed. Additional
details are available in the vulnerability details pane.

Customers can also use the software inventory page in threat and vulnerability management
to view the SolarWinds Orion versions present on endpoints in your environment and
whether the vulnerable versions are present. Links to the threat analytics reports are
provided under the Threats column. You can then assess the footprint of a specific software
in your organization and identify the impacted devices without the need to run scans across
the install base.

Security recommendations are provided to update devices running vulnerable software
versions.

Figure 7. Threat and Vulnerability Management security recommendations page
Security admins can also use advanced hunting to query, refine, and export data. The
following query retrieves an inventory of the SolarWinds Orion software in your organization,
organized by product name and sorted by the number of devices that have software
installed:
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities
| where SoftwareVendor == ‘solarwinds’
| where SoftwareName startswith ‘orion’
| summarize dcount(DeviceName) by SoftwareName
| sort by dcount_DeviceName desc
7/15

The following query searches threat and vulnerability management data for SolarWinds
Orion software known to be affected by Solorigate:
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities
| where CveId == ‘TVM-2020-0002’
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion
For each security recommendation you can submit a request to the IT administrator to
remediate vulnerable devices. Doing this creates a security task in Microsoft Endpoint
Manager (formerly Intune) that can be continuously tracked in the threat and vulnerability
management Remediation page. To use this capability, you need to enable a Microsoft
Endpoint Manager connection.

In addition to providing vulnerability assessments, Threat and Vulnerability Management also
provides security recommendation guidance and device posture assessment that help
mitigate this attack. These recommendations use vulnerability data that is also present in the
Solorigate threat analytics report.

Protecting on-premises and cloud infrastructure
In addition to compromising client endpoints, attackers can also activate backdoor code via
the compromised SolarWinds binary installed on cloud or on-premises servers, allowing
them to gain a stronger foothold in the environment.

Protect your on-premises and cloud servers
A large part of many customers’ infrastructure are virtual machines. Azure Defender helps
security professionals protect cloud workloads spanning virtual machines, SQL, storage,
containers, IoT, Azure network layer, Azure Key Vault, and more.
As mentioned earlier, one of the key actions that should be taken to help prevent Solorigate
and similar attacks is to ensure that all devices are protected and monitored by Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint. Deploying Azure Defender for Servers enables Defender for Endpoint
for your virtual machines to provide comprehensive detection coverage across the Solorigate
attack chain. Azure Defender’s integrated vulnerability assessment solution for Azure and
hybrid machines can also help address the Solorigate attack by providing visibility into
vulnerability assessment findings in Azure Security Center.

Enable additional infrastructure protection and monitoring
To help provide additional in-depth defenses against Solorigate, Azure Defender recently
introduced new protection modules for Azure resources. Enabling these protections can
improve your visibility into malicious activities and increase the number of Azure resources
protected by Azure Defender.
Azure Defender for Resource Manager allows you to continuously monitor all Azure resource
management operations and breadth in protection, which includes the ability to detect
attempts to exclude known malicious files by the VM Antimalware extension and other
suspicious activities that could limit antimalware protection on Azure VMs.
In addition, Azure Defender for DNS ensures that all DNS queries from Azure resources
using Azure DNS, including communication with malicious domains used in the Solorigate
attack, are monitored, and helps identify Solorigate activity across any of your Azure cloud
resources. This helps prevent the malicious Solorigate DLL from being able to connect to a
remote network infrastructure to prepare for possible second-stage payloads.

Protect your Active Directory and AD FS infrastructure

10/15

After gaining access, attackers may attempt to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and
move laterally in the environment. Having complete visibility into your Active Directory, either
completely on-premises or hosted in IaaS machines, is key in detecting these attacks and
identifying opportunities to harden security posture to prevent them.
In hybrid environments, make sure that Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor components
are deployed on all your Domain Controllers and Active Directory Federation Services (AD
FS) servers. Microsoft Defender for Identity not only detects malicious attempts to
compromise your environment but also builds profiles of your on-premises identities for
proactive investigations and provides you with built-in security assessments. We recommend
prioritizing the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Identity sensors and using the
“Unmonitored domain controllers” security assessment, which lists any detected domain
controllers in your environment that are unmonitored. (Note: this capability can monitor your
environment only after deploying at least one sensor on a domain controller.)

Security portal

Protecting Microsoft 365 cloud from on-premises attacks
The end goal of the attackers behind Solorigate is to gain access to a target organization’s
cloud environment, search for accounts of interest, and exfiltrate emails. From a
compromised device, they move laterally across the on-premises environment, stealing
credentials and escalating privileges until they can gain the ability to create SAML tokens
that they then use to access the cloud environment. Protecting cloud resources from onpremises attack can prevent the attackers from successfully achieving their long game.

Implement recommended security configurations to harden cloud posture
Further best practices and recommendations to reduce the attack surface and protect the
cloud from on-premise compromise can be found in our protecting Microsoft 365 cloud from
on-premises attacks blog.

11/15

Implement conditional access and session control to secure access to cloud
resources
In addition to hardening the individual surfaces to disrupt and prevent the attack, extending
policies to implement zero trust and access controls is key in preventing compromised or
unhealthy devices from accessing corporate assets, as well as governing cloud access from
compliant devices.
Enable conditional access policies
Conditional access helps you better protect your users and enterprise information by making
sure that only secure users and devices have access. We recommend implementing the
common recommended policies for securing access to Microsoft 365 cloud services,
including on-premises applications published with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
Application Proxy.
Additionally, you can configure user risk and device risk conditional access policies to enable
access to enterprise information based on the risk level of a user or device, helping keep
trusted users on trusted devices using trusted applications.
Enable real-time monitoring and session control
Directly integrated with conditional access, session controls in Microsoft Cloud App Security
enable extending access decisions into the session, with real-time monitoring and control
over user actions in your sanctioned apps. Implement policies to prevent data exfiltration in
risky situations, including blocking or protecting downloads to risky or unmanaged devices,
as well as for partner users.

Additional recommendations and best practices
Strengthen your security posture even further by reviewing all improvement actions available
via Microsoft Secure Score. Secure Score helps operationalize security posture
management and improve your organizational security hygiene for your production tenant.
Below are some of the Secure Score improvement actions for Azure Active Directory that
have a direct impact against Solorigate attack patterns:
Do not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications
Enable Password Hash Sync if hybrid
Enable policy to block legacy authentication
Enable self-service password reset
Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access
Require MFA for administrative roles
Turn on sign-in risk policy
Turn on user risk policy
Use limited administrative roles
12/15

In addition, you can use the identity security posture assessment feature in Microsoft
Defender for Identity to identify common protection gaps that might exist in your
environment. Addressing detection gaps such as the following improves your Microsoft
Secure Score and improves your overall resilience to a wide range of credential theft attacks:
Stop entities that are exposing credentials in cleartext, including ones that are tagged
as sensitive. Attackers listen to cleartext credentials being sent over the network to
harvest credentials and escalate privileges. While we have no indication that this
technique was used in Solorigate, this is a general attack trend that organizations must
be aware of and prevent.

Cloud App Security portal
Remediate accounts with unsecure attributes that could allow attackers to compromise
them once an initial foothold in the environment is established.

Reduce risky lateral movement paths to sensitive users. An attacker could move
across devices to elevate to a more privileged role and operate deeper in your
organization’s environment, as we’ve witnessed in the Solorigate attack.

Multiple layers of coordinated defense against advanced crossdomain attacks
Microsoft 365 Defender and Azure Defender deliver unified, intelligent, and automated
security across domains to empower organizations to gain end-to-end threat visibility, which
as the Solorigate attack has shown, is a critical security capability for all organizations to
have. In addition to providing comprehensive visibility and rich investigation tools, Microsoft
365 Defender and Azure Defender help you to continuously improve your security posture as
