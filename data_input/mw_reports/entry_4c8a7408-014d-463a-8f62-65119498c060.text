Summary
As this research reveals, mapping out adversary infrastructure has distinct advantages that
enable a proactive response to future threats. A well resourced team with access to the right
tools can monitor changes to adversary infrastructure in real time, discoveries can become
strategic advantages when fully exploited. This blog is geared towards the practitioner threat
hunters and threat researchers, anyone reading this with the bottomline in mind should take
a look at our economic study here first.

Introduction

1/11

We began tracking the threat actor Hagga in late 2021 following the release of an analysis by
Z-Lab (Yoroi Security’s malware research team). Z-Lab were tracking a worldwide campaign
to distribute the Agent Tesla information stealer through an elusive multi-stage infection
process. In their analysis, they shared the IOCs for this campaign, including a single
hardcoded IP address (69.174.99.181) and a common URL directory pattern for the
identified C2 panels.
This blog will describe how we were able to pivot in threat telemetry, using these IOCs as
seeds, to identify several other C2s used by this threat actor, ultimately leading us to a
backend MySQL server.

Key Observations
Hagga infrastructure is hosted on dedicated leased infrastructure, largely on
QuadraNet and Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications (VNPT).
.
An HTTPS certificate serves as a key indicator of Hagga C2 panels.
69.174.99.181 (QuadraNet, US)
Passive DNS data for 69.174.99.181 identified it hosting the domain
(update.)newbotv4[.]monster from 01 November 2021 onwards. During the period 17
September – 17 December 2021, no further domains were hosted on this IP, indicating it was
likely dedicated infrastructure (and not a compromised / shared host).
Reviewing certificate data for this IP address identified an expired self-signed SSL certificate
with a CN value of localhost.
SHA1: B0:23:8C:54:7A:90:5B:FA:11:9C:4E:8B:AC:CA:EA:CF:36:49:1F:F6
Whilst examining threat telemetry for 69.174.99.181, it was noted that 97% of the observed
data related to communications with a single Hostinger IP address on TCP/3306 (the default
port for MySQL servers). This activity occurred between 14 October – 17 December;
occurring during the same time window as the Agent Tesla campaign identified by Z-Lab.
Hostinger IP Address
Note: The Hostinger IP address is redacted throughout this report. As backend infrastructure,
its identification would not provide any value to network defenders, and as explained below is
likely also utilized for unconnected shared hosting purposes.
Passive DNS data identified this IP as a web hosting control panel server. This is supported
by open ports data identifying 16 TCP ports that are associated with Hostinger cPanel
services. Namely, ports 21, 25, 80, 110, 143, 443, 465, 587, 993, 995, 2080, 2083, 2086,
2087, and 3306.
Threat telemetry data for the Hostinger IP address identified inbound connections to
TCP/3306 from numerous other IP addresses dating back to at least 17 September 2021. It
was assessed that the IP was shared amongst other Hostinger clients, who were likely
unconnected to malicious activities.

Hostinger MySQL Clients
Considering the likelihood that the Hostinger IP was used in shared hosting, we needed to
include additional constraints to limit our scope to data of relevance to the initial (and
potentially other) C2s.
We identified several HTTP requests to the original C2 IP address, with several ‘webpanel’
paths using a common naming convention. These paths aligned with the Z-LAB C2
indicators.

Table 1: 69.174.99.181 URL Requests

In addition, we also identified requests to one of the other Hostinger MySQL clients that
matched one of the ‘webpanel-‘ patterns:

Table 2: 155.94.209.50 URL Requests

Interestingly, one of the 155.94.209.50 URL requests was for a ‘login.php’ page. When
navigating to that URL we were taken to a login page containing a “Mana Tools” logo.

Figure 3: Mana Tools C2 Panel

Whilst we did not have evidence of a URL request to 69.174.99.181 for a ‘login.php’ page,
when navigating to the URL http[:]//69.174.99.181/webpanel-reza/login[.]php we were taken
to an identical page.
First reported in 2019 by Yoroi researchers, Mana Tools is a malware distribution and C2
panel that was created by the threat actor Hagga. It has been associated with several wellknown malware variants, including RevengeRAT, AzoRult, Lokibot, Formbook, and Agent
Tesla.
In addition to 155.94.209.50, we identified a further three MySQL clients hosting the same
expired self-signed SSL certificate as 69.174.99.181.

5/11

According to reverse DNS and WHOIS information, all the identified IPs (based on URL and
certificate data) are hosted on QuadraNet infrastructure.

Figure 4: Hostinger MySQL Client Relation

Examining open ports data for each of the above IPs, it appears that they are run on MSWindows based operating systems. In addition to having standard Windows ports open,
TCP/445, TCP/3389, and TCP/445, they also returned WIN-NetBIOS Computer Names in
the RDP response.
We also found commonalities amongst several of the Hostinger MySQL client IPs in Passive
DNS data.
Domain bot.statusupdate[.]one (resolving to 161.129.64.49) was also observed in URL
request data in connection with the Mana Tools C2 panel. 64.188.20.198 replaced the
original C2 (69.174.99.181) as the hosting IP for domain update.newbotv2[.]monster.
Based on threat telemetry for communications with the Hostinger IP and timestamps for the
Passive DNS resolutions, it appears that the threat actor “rebranded” the C2 domain from
bot.statusupdate[.]one to newbotv4[.]monster around 13 October 2021.
The X.509 Certificate

6/11

It was identified that the certificate (Figure 3) with the serial B5C752C98781B503 was a
default certificate included with OpenSSL as part of an XAMPP installation. XAMPP is a free,
open-source distribution that packages OpenSSL, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl with an Apache
web server. Its primary use is for developers, allowing them to deploy a web server on a local
server to test web applications without the need for an internet connection.
Given that this certificate was installed on several systems hosting Mana Tools, it appeared
that this threat actor was using XAMPP as the web server to host the Mana Tools C2 panel
on Windows virtual servers.
Back to the Hostinger IP
Having identified the Hostinger IP as a common destination for MySQL traffic from several
Hagga C2s, we needed to find more evidence to connect Hagga to the cPanel server. As
stated earlier, given the possibility that the cPanel IP is shared amongst multiple Hostinger
customers, this was difficult to achieve based on threat telemetry alone. To aid this process,
we used insight derived from MalBeacon, in addition to further Passive DNS data.
Note: MalBeacon is a revolutionary system that can attribute malware campaigns to the
threat actor themselves through proprietary pixel tracking technology. If you haven’t heard of
it before, I urge you to check it out.
MalBeacon data identified several actor IPs in the vicinity of Lahore, Pakistan, associated
with the C2s 69.174.99.181 and 64.188.20.198.

Table 3: Malbeacon data

Whilst examining threat telemetry data for the Hostinger IP, we found cPanel management
traffic to TCP/2083 from the actor IP 42.201.155.21 on 26 November 2021 and from
42.201.155.40 between 02 December 2021 and 03 December 2021. This activity aligned
with the dates the IPs were associated with the Hagga C2s.
7/11

We also identified resolutions in passive DNS data that connect the newbotv4.monster and
statusupdate.one domains to Hostinger.

Table 4: Hostinger PDNS Results

Whilst the response IP differed from the Hostinger IP address seen in the outbound
TCP/3306 connections, it aligned with the processes of leasing a cPanel VPS with Hostinger.
When a user purchases their cPanel account through Hostinger, they are asked to add the
domain that they are seeking to host on the account to start the service. Once that domain is
added, Hostinger assigns several default hostnames to the domain that resolve to a second
IP address, which differs from the cPanel management IP first provided. These default
hostnames are what are detailed in Table 4.
The cPanel management IP can continue to be used for access to the web server control
panel, or as an endpoint for a MySQL database.

Continued Observation of Hostinger IP

8/11

By continuously monitoring threat telemetry for the Hostinger IP and examining X.509
certificates and URL requests for new MySQL clients, we were able to identify additional
related C2 infrastructure within hours or days of them being stood up.

72.11.157.208 (QuadraNet, US)

194.31.98.108 (PREFIXBROKER, NL)
103.133.105.61 (VNPT-AS-VN, VN)
78.138.105.142 VELIANET-FR-PINETLLC, FR)
103.153.77.98 (VNPT-AS-VN, VN)
Additionally, we were able to identify an upgrade to the Mana Tools C2 panel.

Figure 5: New Mana Tools C2 Panel

We revisited MalBeacon to examine beacon data for the newly discovered C2 domains and
IP addresses to enumerate associated activity. We subsequently identified several ‘new’
adversary IPs in the vicinity of Lahore, Pakistan. These IPs were observed in

9/11

communications with the Hostinger IP during the same timeframe they were associated with
the Hagga C2 panels.

Conclusion
From the starting point of an IP address (69.174.99.181) associated with an Agent Tesla
command and control server, it was possible to pivot and identify a backend server hosting a
MySQL database operated by the threat actor Hagga. From this point a further pivot led us to
the identification of additional C2s hosting the Mana Tools C2 panel along with a common
certificate that can be used to increase confidence in attributing future infrastructure to this
threat actor.
