Supply Chain Compromise
cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise

CISA is tracking a significant cyber incident impacting enterprise networks across federal,
state, and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private
sector organizations. An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is responsible for
compromising the SolarWinds Orion software supply chain, as well as widespread abuse of
commonly used authentication mechanisms. This threat actor has the resources, patience,
and expertise to gain access to and privileges over highly sensitive information if left
unchecked. CISA urges organizations to prioritize measures to identify and address this
threat.
Pursuant to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have formed a Cyber
Unified Coordination Group (UCG) to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this
significant cyber incident.
CISA also remains in regular contact with public and private sector stakeholders and
international partners, providing technical assistance upon request, and making information
and resources available to help those affected to recover quickly from incidents related to
this campaign.
CISA encourages individuals and organizations to refer to the resources below for additional
information on this compromise. These resources provide information to help organizations
detect and prevent this activity.
CISA released the CISA Hunt and Incident Response Program (CHIRP), a forensics
collection capability outlined in Activity Alert AA21-077A and available on CISA’s CHIRP
GitHub repository. This capability was developed to assist network defenders with detecting
advanced persistent threat (APT) activity related to the SolarWinds and Active
Directory/M365 compromise. The initial release of CHIRP scans for signs of APT
compromise within an on-premises environment to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs)
associated with CISA Alerts AA20-352A and AA21-008A.

A demonstration video is available on CISA’s YouTube channel to help agencies and
organizations understand how to use CHIRP.

Emergency Directive and Updates
CISA Updates Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01
On January 6, 2021, CISA released supplemental guidance v3 that requires (1)
agencies that ran affected versions conduct forensic analysis, (2) agencies that
accept the risk of running SolarWinds Orion comply with certain hardening
requirements, and (3) reporting by agency from department-level Chief
Information Officers (CIOs) by Tuesday, January 19, and Monday, January 25,
2020.
CISA Updates Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01
On December 30, 2020, CISA released guidance to supplement the Emergency
Directive (ED) 21-01 and Supplemental Guidance v1 issued on December 18,
2020. Specifically, all federal agencies operating versions of the SolarWinds
Orion platform other than those identified as “affected versions” are required to
use at least SolarWinds Orion Platform version 2020.2.1HF2.
CISA Supplemental Guidance on Emergency Directive 21-01
On December 18, 2020, CISA’s supplemental release provides additional
guidance on the implementation of ED 21-01, to include an update on affected
versions, guidance for agencies using third-party service providers, and additional
clarity on required actions.
CISA Emergency Directive 21-01
On December 13, 2020 CISA determined that this exploitation of SolarWinds
products poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch
agencies and requires emergency action. Multiple versions of SolarWinds Orion
are currently being exploited by malicious actors. This tactic permits an attacker
to gain access to network traffic management systems. Disconnecting affected
devices, as described in Required Action 2 of the ED, is the only known mitigation
measure currently available.
