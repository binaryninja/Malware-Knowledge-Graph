A Detailed Walkthrough of Nefilim Ransomware TTPs
Over the course of 2020, the number of ransomware attacks has increased enormously. As an emerging ransomware
family, Nefilim has caused dozens of high profile breaches since March 2020. In this blog post, we provide tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized by the Nefilim threat actors, since detecting and blocking TTPs used by a
threat is the most effective method to prevent that threat. TTPs allow us to detect potential intrusions and analyze the
behavior of those attempting to intrude.
Our analysis uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) version 8
framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 8.1 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
This blog describes:
TTPs used by the Nefilim ransomware, categorized under MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.
An example threat in the Picus Threat Library that can be used to simulate the TTP.
An example mitigation rule in the Picus Mitigation Library that can be used to prevent/detect the given TTP.
1. Initial Access
Adversaries use Initial Access techniques to gain a foothold in the target network.
1.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application

3.3 MITRE ATT&CK T1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools
The Nefilim ransomware uses a batch file to stop services and kill processes in the local host. This batch file abuses
taskill.exe using CMD to kill predefined services and processes in the target host. Nefilim distributes this batch
file to multiple hosts using two batch files. One of the batch files uses the ‘copy’ command, and the other one uses
WMI with hard-coded admin credentials.

1. Credential Access
Nefilim threat actor uses hard-coded admin credentials to utilize PsExec and WMI to execute commands and binaries
in remote hosts (lateral movement). Since these credentials are hard-coded in the batch files, it must be stolen before
the attack with some credential access techniques.

1. Discovery
Interestingly, the batch files used by Nefilim include hard-coded Internal IP addresses, admin credentials, services,
and processes. This means that Nefilim attacks are highly targeted attacks as the hard-coded information requires an
intensive discovery operation prior to attacks. Dynamic analysis of the Nefilim ransomware samples shows that the
following techniques are used by Nefilim to discover the required information.

4/9

5.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1518.001 Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery
The Nefilim ransomware uses IsDebuggerPresent , CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent , and
NtQueryInformationProcess API functions to check if a user-mode debugger is running. Debuggers are used by
security analysts to inspect malware’s behavior at the run-time. In the presence of a debugger, malware samples
exhibited less malicious behavior. Moreover, Nefilim uses the NtSetInformationThread API function to evade
debugging.

1. Lateral Movement
Lateral Movement refers to a tactic that adversaries use to move through a network to access and control remote
assets in the network. To accomplish Lateral Movement, adversaries may use legitimate tools with valid accounts as
well as their remote access tools.
6.1. MITRE ATT&CK T1570 Lateral Tool Transfer
The Nefilim ransomware downloads the Psexec.exe tool, and it also abuses the Windows built-in WMI (Windows
Management Instrumentation) utility for lateral movement. PsExec is a free Microsoft tool that can be used to execute
commands and binaries on remote systems and download or upload a file over a network share. Nefilim uses PsExec
and WMI with hard-coded admin credentials to remotely execute the batch files and the ransomware file in remote
hosts.

1. Collection
Adversaries use the techniques in the Collection tactic to gather information relevant to their objectives. Various data
types such as text, audio, and video are collected from multiple sources such as local system cloud, network drive,
removable media, and clipboard. The next goal after data collection is often to exfiltrate the data.
7.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1056.001 Input Capture: Keylogging

The Nefilim ransomware creates a DirectInput object using the DirectDrawCreateEx function to capture
keystrokes. Keylogging is both a Credential Access and Collection tactic.

1. Exfiltration
Adversaries use techniques in the Exfiltration tactic to steal data from your network. They encrypt or compress the
data to be exfiltrated and use different channels and protocols to avoid detection. For example, the Nefilim
ransomware compresses collected files and exfiltrates them to cloud storage.
Data loss protection is one of the top priority issues for CISOs today. Organizations utilize DLP solutions to protect
and secure their data and comply with regulations. Picus simulates the exfiltration of a wide range of data over
different channels to test the effectiveness of both network and endpoint-based data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.
Picus Threat Library includes hundreds of data files consisting of different types of information mapped to standards
and regulations, including PII, PCI DSS, PHI, GDPR, HIPAA, PIPEDA, confidential files such as password files of
OSs, and Intellectual Property (IP) data.
Some examples of data exfiltration attacks in the Picus Threat Library are given in the following table:

8.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1567.002 Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage

Nefilim operators use the MEGAsync application to exfiltrate data to cloud storage. MEGAsync application
synchronizes folders between the infected computer and an adversary-controlled MEGA Cloud Drive.
1. Impact
The Impact tactic covers techniques that manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems to disrupt availability,
compromise integrity, or cover a confidentiality breach.
9.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact
Like other ransomware threats, Nefilim encrypts files on the target system using AES-128 and adds NEFILIM,
NEPHILIM, MERIN, TRAPGET, MEFILIN, TELEGRAM, SIGARETA, or OFFWHITE extension to encrypted files. It
uses an RSA-2048 public key embedded in the ransomware executable to encrypt the AES encryption key. It also
adds a file that includes the ransom note to the root directory, such as C:\NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt .

Nefilim abuses Microsoft's Enhanced Cryptographic Provider to import cryptographic keys and encrypt data with API
functions such as CryptImportKey , CryptAcquireContext , CryptCreateHash , CryptHashData ,
CryptDeriveKey , CryptReleaseContext , CryptDestroyKey , CryptEncrypt .This behavior is a very specific
TTP of ransomware.

9.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1490 Inhibit System Recovery
Deleting volume shadow copies is very typical behavior of ransomware. The Nefilim ransomware uses WMIC with
the following command to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery. WMIC is a commandline utility to access WMI.

Nefilim TTP Map
TTP Map of Nefilim that is created with TTPs detected from dozens of Nefilim ransomware samples can be found in
the table below.
Although these TTPs are determined from the Nefilim samples, they are common in most ransomware families. The
red techniques are very specific ransomware TTPs.

8/9

Conclusion
We analyzed dozens of Nefilim ransomware samples to determine tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized
by Nefilim. Continuously monitoring adversary TTPs within a company’s IT system allows companies to discover
adversary behaviors and stop them before they can go any further. Picus emulates adversary TTPs and gives
actionable mitigation information for each TTP for building a proactive defense against adversaries and their
malware.
