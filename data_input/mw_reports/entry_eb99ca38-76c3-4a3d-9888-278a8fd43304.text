The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential
use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. This data is provided in order
to help cyber security professionals and system administrators to guard against the persistent malicious
actions of cyber actors. This FLASH was coordinated with DHS/CISA.
This FLASH has been released TLP:WHITE

WE NEED YOUR HELP! If you identify any suspicious activity within your enterprise or have related information,

please contact your local FBI Cyber Squad immediately with respect to the procedures outlined in the
Reporting Notice section of this message.
*Note: By reporting any related information to FBI Cyber Squads, you are assisting in sharing information that allows the FBI to track
malicious actors and coordinate with private industry and the United States Government to prevent future intrusions and attacks.

BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware Indicators of Compromise
Summary
This FLASH is part of a series of FBI reports to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with ransomware variants identified through FBI
investigations. As of March 2022, BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware as a service (RaaS) had compromised at
least 60 entities worldwide and is the first ransomware group to do so successfully using RUST,
considered to be a more secure programming language that offers improved performance and reliable
concurrent processing. BlackCat-affiliated threat actors typically request ransom payments of several
million dollars in Bitcoin and Monero but have accepted ransom payments below the initial ransom
demand amount. Many of the developers and money launderers for BlackCat/ALPHV are linked to
Darkside/Blackmatter, indicating they have extensive networks and experience with ransomware
operations.

Technical Details
BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware leverages previously compromised user credentials to gain initial access to
the victim system. Once the malware establishes access, it compromises Active Directory user and
administrator accounts. The malware uses Windows Task Scheduler to configure malicious Group Policy
Objects (GPOs) to deploy ransomware. Initial deployment of the malware leverages PowerShell scripts,
in conjunction with Cobalt Strike, and disables security features within the victim’s network.
BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware also leverages Windows administrative tools and Microsoft Sysinternals
tools during compromise.
BlackCat/ALPHV steals victim data prior to the execution of the ransomware, including from cloud
providers where company or client data was stored.
The actors leverage Windows scripting to deploy ransomware and to compromise additional hosts. For
example, the following batch and PowerShell scripts were observed:


start.bat - launches the ransomware executable with required arguments



est.bat - copies the ransomware to other locations



drag-and-drop-target.bat - launches the ransomware executable for the MySQL Server



run.bat - executes a callout command to an external server using SSH - file names may change
depending on the company and systems affected



Runs1.ps1 – PowerShell script to disable McAfee

Information Requested:
The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include IP logs showing callbacks from foreign
IP addresses, Bitcoin or Monero addresses and transaction IDs, communications with the threat actors,
the decryptor file, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.

Recommended Mitigations:
The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may
also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage
in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI understands that when
victims are faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to protect shareholders,
employees and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the
ransom, the FBI urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing
so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking
ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law.

Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data
resides.
Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review
operating system defined or recognized scheduled tasks for unrecognized “actions” (for
example: review the steps each scheduled task is expected to perform).
Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.
Implement network segmentation.
Require administrator credentials to install software.
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage
device, the cloud).
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches
are released.
Use multifactor authentication where possible.
Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing passwords for
different accounts.
Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote
access/RDP logs.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least
privilege in mind.
Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
