Over the past few weeks, reports of the newest aggressive malware family to impact
Android devices have made the rounds. Flubot, the credential and banking malware family,
uses SMS phishing techniques to propagate to its victims, purporting to be various vendors
and delivery services. The group behind this aggressive malware takes advantage of a
common but effective social engineering technique.
The Zimperium zLabs team has analyzed over 300 variants of Flubot and the URLs used to
distribute them, finding that the aggressive credential stealer comes with unique features
that make it stand out from many other examples of mobile malware seen in the past. The
Android malware has been so effective, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has issued
a cybersecurity warning, providing instructions for removal and reporting of any attempts.
The modern bank robbery is not happening through the front door of a building but with the
path of least resistance – banking credentials. Flubot’s credential theft effectiveness comes
in the form of its delivery and execution. The victim’s phone receives an SMS, instructing
them to click a link to track their “package” via one of the known global shippers. The victim
is redirected to a fake or compromised website where the malicious APK is downloaded
and installed via side loading. The user wants to track their package and installs the
application via side-loading onto the Android device – even walking the victim through the
process if unfamiliar.

After installation, a window appears asking for the victim to
“Accessibility Services” (a restricted capability allowing
monitoring and interaction with all apps/screen content) for the
application, enabling the now-installed application to take control
without the user even knowing. Once the application has this
permission, it uses it to get others such as READ_SMS,
RECEIVE_SMS, and READ_CONTACTS. The app registers
itself as the main SMS client, which will be later used to steal
2FA credentials.
A key component of credential-stealing malware is an effective
command and control (CNC) capability, giving the attacked the
ability to grab what they want and not be flooded with untargeted
data. In the case of Flubot, the CNC backend is not hardcoded
into the malware itself. Instead, it uses a Domain generation
algorithm (DGA) – common in advanced desktop malware to
generate the CNC URL server address. This enables Flubot to continue to evade its victim’s
mobile endpoints if a security team was to block one single address.
Its effectiveness on mobile endpoints is made more so by Flubot’s capability to automate
actions. After disabling Google Play Protect, the Android malware then asks to be set as the
default SMS and notification tool, enabling it to continue spreading to more victims by
collecting contact lists and preventing the victim from seeing the actions. From the moment
the malicious application is installed, it also begins monitoring all the applications installed
in the device. When a targeted application is opened, Flubot performs an overlay attack to
collect user credentials and send this data back to the CNC. At the same time, Flubot uses
SMS permissions to read second-factor authentication codes.

One final and very effective trick Flubot pulls on victims is collecting credit card information
via a fake Google Play credit card re-verification popup. This is again performed as an
overlay attack, looking just like the real popup notification. The unsuspecting victim is
encouraged to fill in the necessary details without a second thought.
Zimperium zIPS customers are protected against 100% of the Flubot variants analyzed with
our zero-day, on-device z9 Mobile Threat Defense machine learning engine.
As a standard protocol, the Zimperium zLabs team checks new malware samples against
not only the current machine learning model but past ones as well. In the case of Flubot,
Zimperium zIPS customers were protected against this aggressive credential stealing
Android malware since the first variant was first reported in February 2020.

The screenshot above highlights how Flubot samples are detected with extreme accuracy
by different releases of our on-device malware classifier. In the Figure, classifiers up to 3
months back in time are displayed, but samples were detected by classifiers going back
over one year.
Zimperium’s z9 malware engine is also able to correctly identify the family of malware
(“banker” in this case) on device, allowing customers to create policies around specific
malware types, and provide supporting forensics.
The URLs used to deliver the APK consisted 80% of compromised domains (a legitimate
website whose hosting server is compromised and a malicious site is stored on it),
rendering most traditional phishing prevention techniques obsolete. All reported URLs were
analyzed using Zimperium’s z9 ML-based phishing engine. In this case, z9 proactively
blocked over 98% of the URLs, preventing the attack chain from its inception. This adds to
the layer of protection and security coverage for our customers.
To ensure your Android users are protected from this latest malware, we recommend a
quick risk assessment. Inside zConsole, admins can review which apps are side-loaded
onto the device that could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at
risk.

Remediating a Flubot Infection on Android
Non-Zimperium Customers: If you have fallen victim to the Flubot malware on your Android
device, immediate action is necessary to avoid more risks. First, disconnect the device from
all connections, including cellular and WiFi, by putting the device into airplane mode. Next,

the most effective way to remove the Android malware is through a factory reset. This will
wipe the mobile device and load a fresh, clean version of the operating system. Do not
restore from backup if it was created after the malware installation. Installing all your user
applications fresh from Google Play ensures that you are downloading safe, approved, and
secure apps. Finally, reset all your banking passwords, enable 2FA if possible, and notify
your banks to increase monitoring on your account.
