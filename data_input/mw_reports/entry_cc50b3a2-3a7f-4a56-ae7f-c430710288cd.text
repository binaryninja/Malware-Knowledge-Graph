Malvertising Surges to Distribute Malware
intel471.com/blog/malvertising-surges-to-distribute-malware

Many intrusions and compromises start with the infection of an endpoint with malicious
software (malware). Malware distribution is often centered around tricking someone into
opening an executable file that purports to be benign, such as a common software utility, but
is actually malicious. One of the most common methods for distributing malware is through
spam, but there are other ways. One long-used technique to land malware on systems saw a
resurgence in December 2022.
“Malvertising” is a portmanteau of malware and advertising. It involves buying search engine
advertisements and placing links in those ads that lead to malicious sites. The technique has
been used by threat actors nearly as long as search-related, pay-per-click (PPC) ads have
been around, but the recent surge was intense and unexpected. Here, Intel 471 explores
how malvertising works, some defenses to employ against it and examples of how it was
recently leveraged to distribute malware.
How PPC Works
Google’s PPC Ads platform is the primary medium actors use to distribute malware. Intel 471
analysts walked through the process of setting up a Google Ads campaign. The exercise
revealed a great deal about how these actors conduct campaigns and some theories about
how they obtain top search results for their advertisements.

Google’s PPC Ads management panel has a fairly intuitive design that allows users to view
their advertisement campaign statistics at a glance. Users can view their current
advertisements, keywords, recommendations, statistics and total cost for each offer. Users
must supply a URL to create an advertisement, display paths for the URL, provide a
description with the offer and craft some headlines for the advertisement. The descriptions,
headlines and site are factored into the equation that Google uses to calculate the
advertisement ranking.
Once an advertisement is created, users can set the maximum amount of money to spend
on PPC for an ad. Advertisement space is sold using a blind auction mechanism where
advertisers can outbid competitors but cannot see what others bid for advertisement space.
Google’s old advertisement ranking algorithm previously considered how much advertisers
bid to award advertisement placement rankings, however, the new system calculates a mix
of advertisement bid price, description, headline and site checking.
Once users create an advertisement and set a bid price, they can begin using the multiple
tools available on the Google Ads platform. Device targeting allows advertisers to set how
much they want to bid on advertisements that will be shown only on certain types of devices,
such as tablets or mobile phones.
Customers can use additional targeting available in the “Audience” tab of the Google Ads
panel. Users can monitor the demographics for people who click on the advertisements,
create targeted advertisements or exclude certain demographics and target specific types of
people, such as those working in financial services or hospitality. The platform also allows
advertisers to target customers based on geolocation in addition to audience tracking, or a
variety of factors that include cities, states and postcodes.

BokBot
BokBot, also known as IcedID, is a banking trojan that also doubles as a downloader for
additional malware. The actors behind the development of BokBot historically had a
relationship with the Conti ransomware group and Trickbot, another type of banking malware
and botnet used to distribute ransomware. During the past year, initial access brokers (IABs)
increasingly used BokBot as gateway malware for attacks in place of the now-defunct
BazarLoader or Trickbot families. In December 2022 and January 2023, BokBot operators
began experimenting with the Google PPC Ads platform for distribution.
The traffic distribution system (TDS) of these BokBot campaigns uses victim and bot filtering
on the landing page where the Google Search Ads engine points. This filtering ensures that
a connecting client is not coming from a virtual private network (VPN) IP address, makes
user agent checks and follows hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) "GET" header criteria. If a

connection does not meet the criteria, the user is not redirected to the BokBot malicious
landing page and instead stays on the advertisement site, which may or may not be related
to the targeted app or brand. This site typically is unrelated to the campaign. Connections
that meet the targeted criteria are redirected to the BokBot malicious landing page and will
never see the advertisement site.
A recent BokBot campaign masqueraded as an advertisement for Docker, an operating
system virtualization platform. The malicious advertisements contain typosquatted domains
and appear higher than the legitimate offer for Docker. Once the user clicks on the ad link,
BokBot’s first typosquatting domain performs some basic bot filtering to determine whether
the viewer of the advertisement is a legitimate victim to target and not a researcher. If the
check fails based on user agent, user agent client hints or geolocation, the Docker campaign
landing page will direct the viewer to a fake tutorial on how to set up and use Docker.

BatLoader and EugenLoader/FakeBat
Malware loaders, also called “droppers,” are the initial infections on systems which are then
used by threat actors to download other malicious code. BatLoader, identified in February
2022, is a type of loader that leverages Microsoft software installers (.msi) and PowerShell.
Intel 471 recently uncovered that two different threat actors are distributing BatLoader
through different command and control (C2) infrastructures. The campaign identified as
BatLoader by Mandiant in 2022 involved the execution of .BAT files by the .MSI during
install. A second campaign, however, does not involve the execution of .BAT files. Instead,
that malware has an inline PowerShell script that is executed in place of the .BAT file. Due to
these differences, Intel 471 analysts have decided to rename the second campaign to
EugenLoader. It is also known as FakeBat.
As public reporting and our own reporting blended EugenLoader and BatLoader, it makes it
hard to identify when EugenLoader first popped up. But it was likely running as of November
or December 2022. During our investigation into EugenLoader, we found a domain that
appeared to be used as the download destination for new campaigns. The root of the domain
was mistakenly left open and revealed .MSI files for EugenLoader campaigns. As seen
below, the EugenLoader malware had been renamed to impersonate known software such
as FileZilla, uTorrent and WinRAR, among others.

During distribution campaigns, EugenLoader stands up domains that purport to offer
legitimate popular software but instead substitute malware for what is promised.

One of the most consistently active malvertising campaigns for EugenLoader masquerades
as WinRAR, which is a popular software utility for compressing and extracting files. While
other campaigns seemed to get their advertisement to the top of the search results
intermittently, the WinRAR campaign has no such limiters. This enables the actors to trick
victims into installing EugenLoader continually.
EugenLoader was also distributed via a malvertising campaign that spoofed 7-Zip, which is
another popular file archiving software. Using well-crafted Google search advertisements,
this campaign is able to place its download links before the official 7-Zip download page as
observed in the image below.

session Jan. 19, 2023.
Analysis
Until recently, malvertising was not a preferred initial access vector and seldomly was used
compared to traditional vectors such as email spam. However, the operators behind
EugenLoader were able to purchase advertisements that consistently appeared in the first
search result position on Google. It should be assumed it is a dangerously successful
technique that has the potential to challenge malware spam (malspam) as the go-to vector
for criminals.
There are advantages and disadvantages for malware distributors to place malicious
advertisements. First, an advantage: Bad actors capture an audience that is actively seeking
out a tool to download. Appearing as the first search result means there’s a high probability
someone may click without closely looking at the domain. The subsequent landing page then
looks identical to the legitimate one, and people are likely to download and install the tool.
This has advantages over spam, which may be caught and quarantined by security tools or
sent to the spam folder, never meeting the eyes of the potential victim. If it does reach the
victim, the attacker must trick the person into taking action, such as opening an invoice,
clicking on a link or running an executable. But malvertising catches people who want to
download something and run it immediately.
Malvertising doesn’t come cheap, however. PPC ads could cost as much as US $2 to US $3
per click. Because bad actors are bidding for ad space, the actions also raise the costs for
legitimate advertisers. It is possible malvertisers are paying for the ads with stolen credit card
information. How bad actors are paying for the ads would be another research avenue to
pursue, which could shed light on groups behind the campaigns.
In some cases, the success of campaigns could be gauged. Some of the malicious ads
directed victims to sites hosted on Bitbucket, which may show the number of downloads.
One campaign showed upward of 3,000 downloads. At US $2 a click, those who placed the
4/5

campaign may have paid as much as US $6,000, which shows the attackers have financial
means. Other types of malware seen in the campaigns included information stealers such as
RedLine. The malware often thwarted VirusTotal submission. The file sizes were up to 700
MB, which is very large compared to the typical size of a dropper or loader. VirusTotal has a
file size limit of 32 MB (files up to 200 MB may be submitted), which meant that malicious
files distributed by the campaigns weren’t necessarily turning up later for analysis.
The malvertising surge, which mostly affected Google, appeared to peak in mid-January
2023 and has fallen since. The security community has been in touch with Google regarding
its findings. Several researchers contributed to a spreadsheet that tracked malvertising
campaigns and the brands that were impersonated. Between Jan. 19, 2023, and Feb. 22,
2023, the spreadsheet contained examples of 584 malvertising campaigns. Also,
researchers created tools such as this one by Randy McEoin that can perform searches for
malvertising and this one by Michael McDonnell that also takes screenshots of the
campaigns. Hopefully, awareness has increased and defenses have been raised to minimize
future malvertising campaigns.
Defensive recommendations
Intel 471 recommends customers consider deploying advertisement-blocking browser
extensions such as the “AdBlock,” “Adblock Plus” or “uBlock Origin” supported browser
extensions. These mitigate the appearance of Google PPC Ads traffic and prevent users
from being duped into attempting to install malware masquerading as a legitimate
application. Additional recommendations are to monitor for unauthorized MSIs and the
installation and running of unsigned executables.
