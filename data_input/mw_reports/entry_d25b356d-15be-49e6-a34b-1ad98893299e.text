Conflict in Ukraine Escalates

March 7, 2022

Key Takeaways
Proofpoint researchers have identified ongoing activity by the China-aligned APT
actor TA416 in which the group is targeting European diplomatic entities, including
an individual involved in refugee and migrant services.
This targeting is consistent with other activity reported by Proofpoint, showing an
interest in refugee policies and logistics across the APT actor landscape which
coincides with increased tensions and now armed conflict between Russia and
Ukraine.
The campaigns utilize web bugs to profile the victims before sending a variety of
PlugX malware payloads via malicious URLs.
TA416 has recently updated its PlugX variant, changing its encoding method and
expanding its configuration capabilities.

Overview
Since 2020, Proofpoint researchers have observed TA416, an actor assessed to be aligned
with the Chinese state, utilizing web bugs to profile their targets. Commonly referred to as
tracking pixels, web bugs embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the body of an
email that, when enabled, will attempt to retrieve a benign image file from an actorcontrolled server. This provides a “sign of life” to threat actors and indicates that the
targeted account is valid with the user being inclined to open emails that utilize social
engineering content. TA416 has been using web bugs to target victims prior to delivering
malicious URLs that have installed a variety of PlugX malware payloads. The operational
tempo of these campaigns, specifically those against European governments, have
increased sharply since Russian troops began amassing on the border of Ukraine.
The use of the web bug reconnaissance technique suggests TA416 is being more
discerning about which targets the group chooses to deliver malware payloads.
Historically, the group primarily delivered web bug URLs alongside malware URLs to
confirm receipt. In 2022, the group started to first profile users and then deliver malware
URLs. This may be an attempt by TA416 to avoid having their malicious tools discovered
and publicly disclosed. By narrowing the lens of targeting from broad phishing campaigns
to focus on targets that have proven to be active and willing to open emails, TA416
increases its chance of success when following up with malicious malware payloads.

The Good, the Bad, and the Web Bug: TA416 Increases Operational Tempo Against European Governments as Conflict in Ukraine Escalate…

What’s In a Web Bug – Delivery in 2020 and 2021
Starting in early November 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified web bug
reconnaissance campaigns targeting European diplomatic entities. Notably this activity
aligned with the escalation of tensions between Russia, Ukraine, and, by extension, NATO
member states in Europe. The emails first originated from a spoofed sender that
impersonated a Meetings Services Assistant at the United Nations General Assembly
Secretariat. Proofpoint did not observe these campaigns targeting the United Nations
(UN), but did observe the targeting of diplomatic entities in Europe under the pretense of
communicating with the UN. The threat actor achieved this impersonation by utilizing
the legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go, which allows users to alter the envelope
sender field while using a unique sender address generated by the service.
TA416 has used SMTP2Go to impersonate various European diplomatic organizations
since at least 2020. The threat actor in an August 2020 campaign impersonated the same
Meetings Services Assistant at the UN General Assembly and again targeted
governmental entities in Europe. In this historical campaign, TA416 delivered a DropBox
URL that delivered a PlugX variant aligning with Recorded Future’s analysis of "Red
Delta" PlugX malware. Proofpoint assesses that there is sizeable overlap between the
entities TA416 and the publicly disclosed group “Red Delta.” Both campaigns from August
2020 and November 2021 targeted European diplomatic entities and utilized SMTP2Go
to impersonate an external diplomatic organization that may communicate with the end
targets. Included below is a publicly available malicious Zip file hash from August 2020
delivered via a DropBox URL which is attributable to TA416/Red Delta.

The Good, the Bad, and the Web Bug: TA416 Increases Operational Tempo Against European Governments as Conflict in Ukraine Escalate…

Proofpoint researchers continued to identify web reconnaissance campaigns in November
and December 2021 that utilized a rudimentary style of encoding and resource names.
Fundamentally, a web bug URL includes infrastructure that hosts a benign image file,
several designations about the email campaign, which can include date and campaign
name, and a unique designation for each individual user targeted in the email campaign.
This allows a threat actor to validate which recipients received and opened the phishing
email. TA416 web bugs appear rudimentary while demonstrating slight evolution over
time. The web bug URL structure began with an actor-controlled IP which retrieved jpg
resources named after the email aliases of the targeted victims from the actor-controlled
servers. Proofpoint researchers next observed base64 encoded values of the entire email
address.
Example:
hxxp://45.154.14[.]235/jdoe.jpg
hxxp://45.154.14[.]235/amRvZUBwcm9vZnBvaW50LmNvbQ==/328.jpg
Researchers identified the same method of base64 encoded target emails, including in the
web bug URL, consistently from August to November 2020 in TA416 campaigns that
preceded the delivery of PlugX malware. On more than one occasion in 2020, this web
bug technique appeared in an email alongside a Dropbox URL that ultimately delivered
the Trident Loader variant of PlugX malware. Proofpoint, Avira, and Recorded
Future have publicly attributed this installation technique to TA416/Red Delta. In the
above referenced campaign from August 2020 in which TA416 impersonated UN
personnel, the threat actor utilized base64 encoded web bug resources representing
targeted emails alongside the cloud hosted URLs that delivered PlugX malware. Actorcontrolled IPs observed during web bug reconnaissance campaigns during the November
to December 2021 period included the IP 45.154.14[.]235.
Beginning on January 17, 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed TA416 threat actors
utilizing the IP address 45.154.14[.]235 in phishing emails attempting to deliver a
malicious Zip file to European Diplomatic entities. These entities had previously received
web bug URLs in phishing emails during the prior months. Rather than the emails
delivering further reconnaissance URLs, this IP now attempted to deliver malicious Zip
files. The phishing email also included a Dropbox URL attempting to deliver the same
malicious archive file. Like historical TA416 campaigns, the Zip file had a geopolitically
themed title, which was shared with a PDF decoy that would be later downloaded as part
of the infection chain. For example, the campaign on January 17, 2022 included the
following Zip and PDF file titles:
State_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.zip
State_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf

While historically TA416 has delivered Zip files from cloud hosting providers containing a
decoy file, legitimate PE file, a DLL loader, and a PlugX malware configuration DAT file,
recent campaigns used a different tactic. Proofpoint researchers noted that the malicious
Zip files delivered from DropBox now contain a rudimentary executable which is a
dropper malware. This malware establishes persistence for a legitimate executable file
used in DLL search order hijacking, as well as initiates the download of four components.
These components are included below and resemble the components used in the past to
install PlugX malware. Public research has previously documented TA416’s propensity for
including PlugX Trident Loader components and decoy in the initial delivered Zip file.
Actors in recent months use a more convoluted delivery chain, in which a PE dropper is
used to retrieve the Trident Loader components from an actor-controlled resource. The
method of installing PlugX via DLL Search Order hijacking that displays a PDF decoy
remains constant.

A More Discerning Breed of TA416 PlugX Malware
Close analysis of the delivered payloads and legitimate resources retrieved from URLs by
the first stage malware dropper reveals that TA416 is once again using an updated version
of PlugX malware to target their victims. Historically, the group has relied on a variety of
legitimate antivirus files, including the Avast file resource wsc_proxy.exe, to begin the
process of DLL search order hijacking that results in PlugX malware installation. In the
January 2022 campaigns, TA416 used the PE file potplayermini.exe to initiate DLL search
order hijacking. This is a legitimate executable file that is part of the publicly available
media player Daum PotPlayer 1.5.29825, which Mandiant has previously documented as
being susceptible to search order hijacking since at least 2016. Numerous Chinese APT
groups, which are not directly correlated to TA416, have utilized it since that time. This
campaign leveraged the vulnerability of potplayermini.exe to load the file PotPlayer.dll
which contains an obfuscated launcher that in turn executes the file PotPlayerDB.dat. The
file DocConvDll.dll has also intermittently been used as a loader of the PlugX DAT
configuration files. For those that are familiar with TA416’s historic tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs), this is highly similar to the Trident Loader method which the
group used to install PlugX in previous campaigns.
While PotPlayerDB.dat is a variant of PlugX malware, TA416 has updated the payload by
changing both its encoding method and expanding the payload’s configuration
capabilities. Historically, TA416 relied on the DLL launcher to decode the PlugX payload
utilizing an XOR key included at the offset 0 within the PlugX DAT configuration file. In
this case, TA416 has abandoned that approach in favor of something with less
dependencies that is more convoluted. The latest version contains obfuscation to thwart

analysis. One of the main ways it does this is by resolving API functions during runtime.
Generally, malware loads a DLL, iterates over the set of exports of the DLL and hashes the
string, looking for a matching hash. This iteration of PlugX does standard API hashing,
but only to resolve the address of the functions GetProcAddress as well as LoadLibrary.
Once those functions are resolved properly, it loads the rest of the functions via their text
name.

In addition to this obfuscation attempt, most of the functions that contain the "business
logic" of the malware are obfuscated with a state machine. At a high level this obscures
the order of which blocks are executed within a function. It does this by maintaining a
state variable with many comparisons in the function. After each block, the state variable
is modified to whatever the subsequent block should be, making analysis more difficult.
This sample further implements anti-analysis techniques via the malware’s design. After
every iteration of the state machine, the malware sample will modify the state with a XOR
operation. This makes it difficult to analyze as the states are not hardcoded as the result
of a function. This control obfuscation is apparent below with the highly cyclical nature of
the control flow graph.

Figure 5. PlugX malware control flow graph.
Once researchers defeated the PlugX anti-analysis techniques, they were able to examine
the malware’s configuration. Notably the configuration contained three additional fields
that were not present in the previous versions nor in standard PlugX malware. The new
version included:
Two hardcoded dates for latest write time used to filter over files within a specified
directory.
A minimum and maximum file size to filter over files within a specified directory.
A format string that defaults to “public/Publics” that modifies characteristics of the
folder and hide it from the infected user.
In the past, when fields have been added to PlugX malware configurations they have
persisted in future samples identified in subsequent campaigns. Recently, this has not
always proven to be true. In recent campaigns, a consistent and clear configuration that is
repeated has not been present. The expansion of the malware’s configuration fields
demonstrates that this tool is undergoing additional development by TA416. Further, the
type of added features that enable better filtering of victim files for exfiltration and better
concealment from the infected user demonstrates that the actor is going beyond antihttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european

analysis to create a more functional and precise tool to use during intrusions. It also
indicates the varying versions of the PlugX payload that are being used in a short period
of time.

Command and Control
The January 2022 version of PlugX malware utilizes RC4 encryption along with a
hardcoded key that is built dynamically. For communications, the data is compressed
then encrypted before sending to the command and control (C2) server and the same
process in reverse is implemented for data received from the C2 server. Below shows the
RC4 key "sV!e@T#L$PH%" as it is being passed along with the encrypted data. The data
is compressed and decompressed via LZNT1 and RtlDecompressBuffer. During the
January 2022 campaigns, the delivered PlugX malware samples communicated with the
C2 server 92.118.188[.]78 over port 187. In the February 2022 campaign, Proofpoint
researchers observed a variation in which PlugX malware used an RC4 key that was sent
to the bot in the first HTTP response which was then used to encrypt data going to the C2
server.

In response to historical disclosures detailing TA416 PlugX malware infection and
encoding methods, the group appears to have adopted a rapid rate of development for
their PlugX payloads. While the distinctly TA416 installation method of a PE dropper
retrieving Trident loaded payload components using a legitimate PE and a DLL loader file
to load a PlugX payload remains constant, the components in this infection chain are
regularly changing. The group uses different legitimate PE files to initiate sideloading, as
well as a variety of PlugX DLL loaders including the PotPlayer and DocCon versions noted
in this publication. TA416 also uses different variants of the final PlugX payload in which
the communication routines are observed to be different when closely analyzed.
Additionally, the payload DAT file decryption method has evolved regularly since the
beginning of 2022. Several observed decryption schemas and a sample configuration are
included below with date ranges detailing the evolution of observed PlugX payloads.

Attribution
Proofpoint researchers assess with high confidence that the operator identified in recent
campaigns delivering PlugX malware is the same as previously identified in 2020 as part
of Recorded Future's Red Delta campaign. This assessment is based on the use of the
same email marketing service to deliver emails, the consistent impersonation of European
diplomatic entities, the repetition of web bug patterns in the 2020, 2021, and 2022
campaigns, the consistent victimology observed between the campaigns, a nearly identical
file naming structure observed between Zip and PDF decoy files, and the highly similar
Trident Loader TTPs used for the execution of PlugX malware.

Europe. While historically the phishing tactics and tools of this group have not been so
thoroughly explored, the consistent reliance on updating PlugX malware installation
using the Trident Loader method belies a lack of innovation on the part of TA416
following several major publications surrounding this actor. TA416 has chosen to
compensate for this lack of innovation with a greater tempo of variation. The group has
proved to be pragmatic, making incremental and staggered changes to their PlugX toolkit
rapidly and regularly altering a toolset it has used for the past number of years. Despite
these variations, the group’s persistent targeting of a habitual target set paired with
ingrained phishing tactics often leads to periodic discovery by threat researchers. Once
TA416 reads this latest publication regarding their tactics, researchers at Proofpoint fully
anticipate they will remain the metaphorical “Tubthumping” of the APT landscape.
Researchers can publish their tactics but will never keep them down.
