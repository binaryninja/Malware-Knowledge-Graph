‘LuminosityLink RAT’ Author Pleads Guilty
krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/luminositylink-rat-author-pleads-guilty/

A 21-year-old Kentucky man has pleaded guilty to authoring and distributing a popular
hacking tool called “LuminosityLink,” a malware strain that security experts say was used
by thousands of customers to gain unauthorized access to tens of thousands of computers
across 78 countries worldwide.

The LuminosityLink Remote Access Tool (RAT) was sold for $40 to thousands of customers, who
used the tool to gain unauthorized access to tens of thousands of computers worldwide.

Federal prosecutors say Colton Ray Grubbs of Stanford, Ky. conspired with others to
market and distribute the LuminosityLink RAT, a $40 Remote Access Tool that made it
simple for buyers to hack into computers to surreptitiously view documents, photographs and
other files on victim PCs. The RAT also let users view what victims were typing on their
keyboards, disable security software, and secretly activate the webcam on the target’s
computer.
Grubbs, who went by the pseudonym “KFC Watermelon,” began selling the tool in May
2015. By mid-2017 he’d sold LuminosityLink to more than 8,600 customers, according to
Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency.
Speculation that Grubbs had been arrested began surfacing last year after KFC Watermelon
stopped responding to customer support queries on Hackforums[dot]net, the Web site where
he primarily sold his product.

Grubbs, using the hacker nickname “KFC Watermelon,” advertised and sold his RAT via
Hackforums.net.

The sale and marketing of remote access tools, also known as remote administration tools,
is not illegal in the United States, and indeed there are plenty of such tools sold by legitimate
companies to help computer experts remotely administer computers.
However, these tools tend to be viewed by prosecutors instead as “Remote Access Trojans”
when their proprietors advertise the programs as hacking devices and provide customer
support aimed at helping buyers deploy the RATs stealthily and evade detection by antimalware programs.
According to the indictment against him, Grubbs “recruited and encouraged co-conspirators
to answer questions on Skype, an internet messaging service, from potential and actual
purchasers of LuminosityLink seeking to use the software to get unauthorized and
undetected access to victim computers and steal information.”
Linking Grubbs to LuminosityLink was likely not a tall hurdle for prosecutors. A public filing at
the Kentucky Secretary of State office lists Grubbs as the owner of Luminosity Security
Solutions LLC.
However, there are indications that Luminosity was not Grubbs’ first foray into making and
selling malware tools. According to a February 2018 blog post by Palo Alto Networks, the
Skype account connected to KFC Watermelon’s identity on Hackforums is tied to the email
address “codyjohnson1337@live.com; that email account was used in 2013 to register
“plasmarat.pw,” a similar RAT sold and marketed on Hackforums.

KFC Watermelon’s Skype profile (the “HF” in his Skype name is a likely reference to HackForums,
where both Luminosity RAT and Plasma RAT were primarily sold and marketed).

The street address listed by the Kentucky Secretary of State’s office for Luminosity Security
Solutions (127 Circle Dr., Stanford, KY) shows up in the original registration records for
dozens of domains, including at least a half-dozen that early on listed the email address
coltongrubbs@gmail.com. That same email address appears in the early registration
records for barracudasec[dot]com, a domain that as far back as 2012 was identified as a
popular “command and control” server that many denizens of Hackforums used to remotely
administer large numbers of remotely commandeered computers or “bots.”
Around the time that KFC Watermelon stopped responding to support requests on
Hackforums, federal prosecutors were securing a guilty plea against Taylor Huddleston, a
then 27-year-old programmer from Arkansas who sold the “NanoCore RAT.” Like Grubbs,
Huddleston initially pleaded not guilty to computer intrusion charges, arguing that he wasn’t
responsible for how customers used his products. That is, until prosecutors presented Skype
logs showing that Huddleston routinely helped buyers work out how to use the tools to
secretly compromise remote computers.
Grubbs’ guilty plea could well lead to further arrests and prosecutions of customers who
purchased and used LuminosityLink. Case in point: The author of the Blackshades
Trojan — once a wildly popular RAT sold principally on Hackforums — was arrested along
along with dozens of his customers in a global law enforcement sweep in 2014.
Indeed, many former customers of LuminosityLink have posted to Hackforums that they are
expecting similar treatment:

Grubbs initially pleaded not guilty, and his trial was slated to begin in August. But in a plea
agreement released today, Grubbs admitted to conspiring to make and sell LuminosityLink,
and to knowingly assisting customers in using his software to break into computers.
The plea agreement notes that on July 10, 2017, when Grubbs found out the FBI was about
to raid his apartment, he hid the phone and debit card tied to his Bitcoin account, and also
removed the hard drives from his computer and apartment prior to the search. “Three days
later, Defendant transferred over 114 bitcoin from his LuminosityLink bitcoin address into six
new bitcoin addresses,” the agreement states.
The charges to which Grubbs has pleaded guilty carry punishments of up to 25 years in
prison and as much as $750,000 in fines, although any sentence the judge hands down in
this case may be significantly tempered by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.
