On October 20th US-CERT published an alert (TA-17-293A) with information about the
activities of an APT targeting the critical infrastructure sector. The report contains an
extensive set of indicators with detailed context and information around them. Part of the
Russian sphere of influence, the threat group discussed in the US-CERT report is the
perpetrator of documented cyber espionage attacks around the world, many of which target
industrial and manufacturing firms and critical infrastructure. Known by many names, the
group is most prominently known as ‘Energetic Bear’ and ‘Crouching Yeti.’
Detailed analysis of Energetic Bear’s malware and activities was recently done by
Kaspersky, and RiskIQ initially investigated them earlier this year. Through our web crawling
network, we were able to determine that a website belonging to a Turkish energy company
was being used in a watering hole attack targeting people associated with Turkish critical
infrastructure. Compromised via a supply chain attack, the site was injected with SMB

credential-harvesting malware. RiskIQ then linked the malicious infrastructure to a string of
related Turkish sites that were compromised for the same purpose and traced the attack
back to a likely timeframe in which it began.
Watering hole attacks, especially those involving supply chain compromises, have been an
extremely effective method for operators of cyber espionage campaigns because they target
victims of specific groups, organizations, and regions, and with close but tumultuous
relations between Turkey and the Russian Federation, Turkey is not a surprising target for
Energetic Bear. We shared our findings with law enforcement and national CERT partners,
but now that the indicators have become public per US-CERT’s publication, we want to give
our unique point of view on the threat.

Strategical Compromise for Reconnaissance
Part of Energetic Bear's campaign involved strategical web compromises that give them
exposure to specific targets. For example, prior activities from the group include
compromising software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components used
in critical infrastructure and backdooring them with the Havex malware. In the case of the
campaign described in the US-CERT report, the group compromised the website of Turcas
Petrol, a Turkish energy company, located at turcas.com.tr.

In May 2017, during one of our crawls of Turcas’ website, RiskIQ encountered a watering
hole setup in use by Energetic Bear. In the screenshot of the website above, you can see
four top elements: ‘Join the Turcas Energy Family,' ‘Announcements,' ‘Company News,’ and
‘Tv interviews.' These separate elements are structured as iframes to other pages on the
website as shown in the DOM capture below:

Fig-2 DOM capture showing the modified subsection

However, the iframe'd page for the 'Announcements' subsection was modified by Energetic
Bear operators to contain a small addition in the form of an image inclusion:

The image URL redirects to a link using the file:// scheme, which forces the connection
through the file protocol, which then allows the group to harvest Microsoft SMB credentials.
This behavior was also noted by Talos, which wrote a detailed analysis of the spear-phishing

emails belonging to the same campaign as this watering hole attack. It’s interesting to note
that the back-end server used in the attack seems to be written using the TornadoServer
Python framework used for building web and networking applications:

In the case of Turcas Petrol, below is the entire chain of events we observed during the
crawl:

In and of itself, this compromise seems targeted at Turcas Petrol and those with a close
relationship with the business, a tactic that mirrors other Energetic Bear campaigns.
Essentially, the group's goal is to influence areas of interest to the Russian Federation. What
we’d like to show, which seems to be missing from the US-CERT report, is the entire chain of
events for this attack.
RiskIQ found that the SMB credential harvesting host at 184.154.150.66 is not always
directly included on the websites. Instead, the intermediary host at 103.41.177.58 is usually
present on the web pages, which, in turn, redirect visitors—most likely with some filtering to
avoid unwanted traffic—to the SMB harvesting host. Additionally, the URL format of the file
requested, which in this case was turcas_icon.png, is not related to the referring website.
Instead, Energetic Bear seems to use a form of tagging to correlate any possible victims and
their source website. The format we observed is <tag>_icon.png and <tag>.png.

Strategical Compromise for Broad Targeting
The previous example of the Turcas Petrol website compromise showed specific targeting.
While company-specific websites were compromised in this campaign, ‘general purpose’
websites were also amongst the victims. One such site is plantengineering.com which serves
as an information and news hub for the critical infrastructure sector.

Fig-6 Another compromised website linked to the attack

For a few months in early 2017, this website had one of its resources compromised, likely
meaning that Energetic Bear operators had broad access to the server. On the main page of
the website, a resource loads from /typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js as
seen in our crawl:

Fig-7 Compromised resource

The compromised resource is a modified version of jQuery Easing JavaScript library. At the
bottom of the script, we can find the SMB credential harvesting link, which is embedded as
an image element in the main page’s DOM:

When we go through more of our data for this very simplified direct image inclusion, we find
a pattern in the URLs and websites. Here are three of our hits:
https://www.plantengineering.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js
https://www.csemag.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js
https://www.controleng.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js
All three URLs are the same, as is the injected content. All the affected websites are news
and information websites for the industrial sector, which indicates a definite pattern. So, who
owns these websites? Looking at the WHOIS information in PassiveTotal we find
plantengineering.com is owned by CFE Media LLC:

Fig-9 WHOIS record for affected sites

Reading a bit further, we find the email address srourke@cfemedia.com was used to register
the domain. Pivoting off this address we can see the same pattern that we saw with the
URLs:

Fig-10 Other affected sites

From our data, RiskIQ found that controleng.com, plantengineering.com, and csemag.com
were all affected by the injection from Energetic Bear. Because they’re geared toward
engineers working in the critical infrastructure sector and thus prime targets for this watering
hole attack, the odds are that CFE Media’s other websites were affected. In fact, CFE Media
has at least six confirmed brands that publish news and information:

Because we started seeing Energetic Bear's SMB-harvesting injection at the end of March
and our crawl data from the end of January was still clean, RiskIQ has been able to pinpoint
the start of the campaign to between the beginning of February and the end March.

Conclusion: Don't Feed the Bear
Over the past few years, supply-chain attacks are becoming more and more prevalent in the
attacker’s portfolio. JavaScript can be changed and compromised without the knowledge of
the site owner, finding its way onto a site when public code was modified downstream. To
prevent this, site owners must have an understanding of what belongs to their organization,
how it’s connected to the rest of their asset inventory, including inventorying all the third-party
code running on their web assets so they can avoid being a pawn by operators like Energetic
Bear.
