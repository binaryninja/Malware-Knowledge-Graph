Key Takeaways
RTF template injection is a novel technique that is ideal for malicious phishing attachments
because it is simple and allows threat actors to retrieve malicious content from a remote URL
using an RTF file.

1/15

Proofpoint has observed three APT actors from India, Russia, and China using this technique
in 2021, targeting a variety of entities likely of interest to their respective states.
RTF template injection is poised for wider adoption in the threat landscape including among
cybercriminals based on its ease of use and relative effectiveness when compared with other
phishing attachment template injection-based techniques.

Overview
Proofpoint threat researchers have observed the adoption of a novel and easily implemented
phishing attachment technique by APT threat actors in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. This technique,
referred to as RTF template injection, leverages the legitimate RTF template functionality. It
subverts the plain text document formatting properties of an RTF file and allows the retrieval of a
URL resource instead of a file resource via an RTF’s template control word capability. This enables
a threat actor to replace a legitimate file destination with a URL from which a remote payload may
be retrieved.
The sample RTF template injection files analyzed for this publication currently have a lower
detection rate by public antivirus engines when compared to the well-known Office-based template
injection technique. Proofpoint has identified distinct phishing campaigns utilizing the technique
which have been attributed to a diverse set of APT threat actors in the wild. While this technique
appears to be making the rounds among APT actors in several nations, Proofpoint assesses with
moderate confidence, based on the recent rise in its usage and the triviality of its implementation,
that it could soon be adopted by cybercriminals as well.

RTF Template Injection
RTF template injection is a simple technique in which an RTF file containing decoy content can be
altered to allow for the retrieval of content hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. By
altering an RTF file’s document formatting properties, specifically the document formatting control
word for “\*\template” structure, actors can weaponize an RTF file to retrieve remote content by
specifying a URL resource instead of an accessible file resource destination. RTF files include their
document formatting properties as plaintext strings within the bytes of the file. This allows the
property control word syntax to be referenced even in the absence of a word processor application,
providing formatting stability for the filetype across numerous platforms. However, RTF files based
on the malleability of these plaintext strings within the bytes of a file are often subverted for
malicious file delivery purposes in the context of a phishing campaign. While historically the use of
embedded malicious RTF objects has been well documented as a method for delivering malware
files using RTFs, this new technique is more simplistic and, in some ways, a more effective method
for remote payload delivery than previously documented techniques.

Figure 1. RTF Document Formatting Properties Rich Text Format (RTF) Version 1.5 Specification.
As documented in the RTF file Version 1.5 specifications (Figure 1), RTF files include a
“\*\template” control word, where the value “*\” designates that the following value is a destination,
and “template” designates the specific control word function. This control word value is intended to
be the destination of a legitimate template file which is retrieved and loaded upon the opening of
the initial RTF, changing the visual appearance of the file. However, it is trivial to alter the bytes of
an existing RTF file to insert a template control word destination including a URL resource. This
allows the RTF file to retrieve a URL resource as a destination rather than a file like the RTF
structure intends. This method is viable in both .rtf and .doc.rtf files, allowing for the successful
retrieval of remote payloads hosted at an external URL.

RTF Template Injection in Microsoft Word
In the case of .doc.rtf files the extension specifies that the RTF file will be opened utilizing Microsoft
Word. As a result, when an RTF Remote Template Injection file is opened using Microsoft Word,
the application will retrieve the resource from the specified URL before proceeding to display the
lure content of the file. This technique is successful despite the inserted URL not being a valid
document template file. This process is demonstrated in Figures 2 and 3 below in which an RTF
file has been weaponized by researchers to retrieve the documentation page for RTF version 1.5
from a URL at the time the file is opened. The technique is also valid in the .rtf file extension
format, however a message is displayed when opened in Word which indicates that the content of
the specified URL is being downloaded and in some instances an error message is displayed in
which the application specifies that an invalid document template was utilized prior to then
displaying the lure content within the file.

Weaponization
4/15

The weaponization of an RTF file can be achieved by creating or altering an existing RTF file’s
document property bytes using a hex editor. This technique does not require the use of a word
processor application for the injection of the RTF remote template URL into the file. The example in
Figure 4 demonstrates the insertion of a template control word into an existing RTF file, specifically
within a preexisting enclosing group for a font family control word. Note that the template control
word value is not contained in an independent set of braces, which results in an invalid RTF file
format error. Instead, it is appended at the beginning of an existing enclosing group for a font family
control word allowing for a valid RTF file structure. This is not the only control word group of an
RTF file that will successfully incorporate a template control word as part of an existing enclosing
group. RTF files allow for the parsing of destination control words in a number of enclosing groups
throughout the file structure. The below file excerpt has been included for demonstrative
purposes.

The success of this technique was tested in a limited capacity by researchers at Proofpoint and is
likely more malleable than what has been demonstrated in this publication. The malleability of this
method paired with an RTF file’s capability to render encoding for Unicode characters further
increases the viability of this technique. By including the template control word within various
enclosing groups of a file and utilizing Unicode rendering to obfuscate the included URLs, this
technique may prove to be an in the wild alternative to Office based Template Injection.

A Timeline of APT Actors Adopting RTF Template Injection
Proofpoint has observed an increasing adoption of RTF template injection from February through
April of 2021 by APT threat actors. While the technique appears to pre-date this adoption with
researchers mentioning the technique as early as January 2021, two distinct APT groups believed
to be associated with the state interests of India and China adopted RTF template injection during
this time. Signs of weaponization including the registration of delivery infrastructure were observed
beginning on March 15, 2021 and April 8, 2021, respectively, with multiple distinct campaigns
following throughout the months of April and May.
Template injection RTF files attributable to the APT group DoNot Team, that has historically been
suspected of being aligned with Indian-state interests, were identified through July 8, 2021. RTF
files likely attributable to a Chinese-related APT actor were identified as recently as September 29,
2021, targeting entities with ties to Malaysian deep water energy exploration. Following this initial
adoption period, the APT actor Gamaredon, which has been linked to the Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB), was later observed utilizing RTF template injection files in campaigns that
leveraged Ukrainian governmental file lures on October 5, 2021.

Analyzing DoNot Team RTF Template Injection
6/15

The earliest observed public instance of the APT actor DoNot Team utilizing RTF template injection
files appears to have occurred in February 2021 with lures referencing the same period. Some RTF
template injection files attributed by security researchers to DoNot Team had compilation
timestamps from 2017, suggesting possible earlier adoption. However, Proofpoint could not verify
this group’s usage of the technique dating back several years and note that manipulation of
compilation stamps in RTF files is a technique within threat actors’ capabilities.
Files publicly identified on April 5, 2021 utilize Unicode-signed 16-bit character notation within the
RTF file that, when rendered, are revealed to be the remote template injection URL within the RTF
template property field. This group used this same technique throughout subsequent campaigns
spanning from April through July 2021. Samples from the campaign utilized “defense proposal”
lures and appeared to target entities in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The use of Unicode signed
character notation provides an obfuscation for the URL value included in the RTF file and is likely
used by actors as an effort to evade static detection signatures in anti-virus engines. The ability of
RTF files to parse these signed 16-bit Unicode characters provides actors an alternative to using
plaintext strings containing a URL, which allows for easy analysis of malicious samples upon
detection. A detailed description of how to decode this URL format within DoNot Team files has
been published by the security analyst Rafa Pedrero following mention of the sample in
open source.

Figure 6. DoNot Team RTF template injection File Signed 16-Bit Unicode Template URL.
A deeper analysis of the structure of DoNot Team’s RTF template injection files reveals that they
are including the template formatting property within a preexisting list override table in the RTF file.
This table is part of a list of lists within an RTF that governs the formatting of various document
features including things like headers, footers, and footnotes. In the case of the DoNot Team
attachment files, the malicious template control word is embedded within the “\*\wgrffmtfilter”
control word enclosing group. This feature is intended to apply a set of filters that will limit the
displayed document style options in Microsoft Word when an RTF file is opened. The
“wgrffmtfilters” are normally specified by four-digit hexadecimal values. This preexisting

8/15

hexadecimal value may have informed the threat actor’s decision to include the template field in
this section, since they used Unicode-signed 16-bit format to replace an existing hexadecimal
value.
Despite the perceived sophistication in using Unicode encoding within the RTF injection template,
DoNot Team appears to have struggled to seamlessly integrate the template control word into the
RTF file for initialization in Microsoft Word. When opening the files in Microsoft Word, a
downloading message is displayed which reveals the intended malicious URL along with the
invalid document template error message described above. These messages are visible in Figures
7 and 8. Further the files were altogether lacking social engineering content, displaying a blank
document after the downloading alert and error messages were displayed. Samples analyzed for
the purposes of this blog include:

TA423 Adopts RTF Template Injection to Target Malaysia
Between April and late September 2021, security researchers identified RTF template injection files
in campaigns targeting entities in Malaysia as well as international companies operating in the
energy exploration sector. These files demonstrate a persistent targeting of entities operating in the
region utilizing RTF template injection files as phishing attachments. Unlike previously observed
variants of files using this technique, these files include remote template injection URLs in plaintext.
The URLs referencing external content were plainly visible in the strings of the RTF attachments.
Of note is that this threat actor also weaponized the RTF files by using a different section of the
document formatting properties than was previously observed among the DoNot Team campaigns.
This actor chose to modify a preexisting enclosing group with a font family control word rather than
the "wgrffmtfilters” group previously discussed. Below is an analyzed public sample from July 2021
for demonstrative purposes:

Gamaredon Onboards RTF Template Injection Capabilities
At the beginning of October 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified public samples of Gamaredon
RTF template injection documents which impersonated the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. This
tactic is consistent with reporting on this APT group that links Gamaredon to the Russian FSB
operating in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. The files communicate with the
domain pretence77.glorious[.]nonima[.]ru which also was a remote template delivery URL used by
several Microsoft Office Word documents that impersonated Ukrainian government organizations.
These Office files communicate with actor infrastructure using a URI pattern previously observed
among Gamaredon malicious Microsoft Office phishing documents. Specifically, the Microsoft
Office documents used remote template injection to retrieve malicious payload files using URIs
with the directory “/ELENAPC/principles/” on several occasions. Additionally, in several instances
the resources retrieved delivered an MP3 file as a delivery resource.
The combination of these shared delivery domains, use of known Gamaredon remote template
injection document techniques, social engineering lures impersonating governmental organizations
within the groups primary area of responsibility, and the URI patterns across both RTF and Office
template injection files allowed researchers to attribute the samples to Gamaredon.
Researchers note that several of these Office remote template injection documents
were identified in open-source in relation to Gamaredon on October 6, 2021.

The RTF template injection files observed in use by the Gamaredon group notably includes the
template control word in the same group as DoNot Team malicious files. Gamaredon similarly
utilizes the “\*\wgrffmtfilter” control word enclosure group that governs document style filters.
Gamaredon, however, opts to include the URL in plaintext rather than using signed 16-bit Unicode
values. Gamaredon’s use of this technique alongside several other attachment delivery methods,
such as Office and XML template documents which all share a single remote template URL,
suggests that the actor is experimenting with new file types. The actor may be comparing the
effectiveness of their efforts that utilize diverse attachment files to gauge the efficacy of their
phishing tactics as they stage new campaigns. While Proofpoint cannot definitively determine
where Gamaredon may have encountered this RTF template injection technique, the inclusion of
the template control word within the style filter section of the document suggests that they may be
replicating capabilities encountered in open-source that were previously used as part of the DoNot
Team campaigns earlier in 2021.

Outlook: Injections are So 2021
The viability of XML Office based remote template documents has proven that this type of delivery
mechanism is a durable and effective method when paired with phishing as an initial delivery
vector. The innovation by threat actors to bring this method to a new file type in RTFs represents

13/15

an expanding surface area of threat for organizations worldwide. While this method currently is
used by a limited number of APT actors with a range of sophistication, the technique’s
effectiveness combined with its ease of use is likely to drive its adoption further across the threat
landscape. Ultimately this is a technique poised for wider adoption in the threat landscape beyond
targeted phishing attacks with likely adopters being crimeware actors. While Indian and Chinese
APT actors have demonstrated an affinity for RTF file types in the past by using RTF weaponizers
like the tool Royal Road, defenders eventually saw those tools and techniques become widely
used by less sophisticated actors. This well-established trickle-down pattern may be accelerated in
this case based on the minimal effort needed to weaponize RTF attachments before deploying in
active phishing campaigns
