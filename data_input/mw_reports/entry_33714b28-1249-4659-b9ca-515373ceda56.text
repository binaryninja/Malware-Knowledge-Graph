Briefing Room
• Presidential Actions
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of
title 3, United States Code,
I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that specified
harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation — in particular, efforts
to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in
the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyberenabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use
transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities
targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to
United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law,
including respect for the territorial integrity of states — constitute an unusual and

1/5

extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
Accordingly, I hereby order:
Section 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession
or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(a) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, and, with respect to subsection (a)(ii) of this section, in consultation with
the Attorney General, or by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, and, with respect to subsection (a)(ii) of this section, in consultation with the
Attorney General:
(i) to operate or have operated in the technology sector or the defense and related
materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy, or any other sector of the Russian
Federation economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation
with the Secretary of State;
(ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or
attempted to engage in, any of the following for or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, directly
or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation:
(A) malicious cyber-enabled activities;
(B) interference in a United States or other foreign government election;
(C) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in
the United States or abroad;
(D) transnational corruption;
(E) assassination, murder, or other unlawful killing of, or infliction of other bodily
harm against, a United States person or a citizen or national of a United States ally or
partner;
(F) activities that undermine the peace, security, political stability, or territorial
integrity of the United States, its allies, or its partners; or
(G) deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent any United
States sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets or the use of
physical assets;
(iii) to be or have been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the
board of directors of:
(A) the Government of the Russian Federation;

in subsection (a)(ii) of this section; or
(C) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this
order;
(iv) to be a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the
Russian Federation;
(v) to be a spouse or adult child of any person whose property and interests in

2/5

property are blocked pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) or (iii) of this section;
(vi) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or
technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of:
(A) any activity described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section; or
(B) any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to
this order; or
(vii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf
of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation or any person whose
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
(b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or
technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a government whose
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to chapter V of title 31 of the Code of
Federal Regulations or another Executive Order, and to be:
(i) a citizen or national of the Russian Federation;
(ii) an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction
within the Russian Federation (including foreign branches); or
(iii) a person ordinarily resident in the Russian Federation.
(c) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Treasury, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in
or attempted to engage in, cutting or disrupting gas or energy supplies to Europe, the
Caucasus, or Asia, and to be:
(i) an individual who is a citizen or national of the Russian Federation; or
(ii) an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction
within the Russian Federation (including foreign branches).
(d) The prohibitions in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply except to the
extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be
issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or
permit granted before the date of this order.
Sec. 2. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:
(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for
the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to
this order; and
(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such
person.
Sec. 3. (a) The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of
noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be
detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the
Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that
the person’s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when
the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines,

3/5

based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person’s entry would further
important United States law enforcement objectives.
(b) The Secretary of State shall implement this authority as it applies to visas pursuant to
such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, may establish.
(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the
entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.
(d) Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered
by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to
United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers
Act Sanctions).
Sec. 4. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this
order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is
prohibited.
Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified
in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby
prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation,
group, subgroup, or other organization;
(b) the term “Government of the Russian Federation” means the Government of the
Russian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and any person owned, controlled, or directed by, or
acting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation;
(c) the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of
the United States;
(d) the term “person” means an individual or entity; and
(e) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, lawful permanent
resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the
United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant
to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that
because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such
persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the
national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or
determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.

4/5

Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is
hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations,
and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable
law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All
departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within
their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 9. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official
business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized
agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and
contractors thereof.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is
hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national
emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C.
1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 11. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head
thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to
budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the
availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its
departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
