Overview
Since June 2019, Mandiant has reported to customers on an influence campaign known as
DRAGONBRIDGE, comprising a network of thousands of inauthentic accounts across
numerous social media platforms, websites, and forums that have promoted various
narratives in support of the political interests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). We
have since observed multiple shifts in DRAGONBRIDGE tactics, and in September 2021, we
reported on an expansion of this campaign’s activity.
Recently, we identified and investigated a subset of information operations activity we
attribute to the DRAGONBRIDGE campaign across social media that targeted the Australian
rare earths mining company, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd, with content criticizing its alleged
environmental record and calling for protests of its planned construction of a rare earths
processing facility in Texas. Subsequently in June, we observed additional
DRAGONBRIDGE activity begin to target the Canadian rare earths mining company Appia
Rare Earths & Uranium Corp and the American rare earths manufacturing company USA
Rare Earth with negative messaging in response to potential or planned rare earths
production activities involving those companies.

Mandiant has contacted Lynas, Appia, and USA Rare Earth about this activity, as well as
social media platforms where this campaign promoted content. The campaign also promoted
content criticizing the Biden administration’s decision to invoke the Defense Production Act
on March 31, 2022, to expedite the domestic production of critical minerals to end U.S.
reliance on China for its supply.
We highlight this activity as particularly notable for two reasons:
It targeted an industry of strategic significance to the PRC, including specifically three
commercial entities challenging the PRC’s global market dominance in that industry.
Rare earth metals are a critical part of consumer and defense products such as missile
guidance systems and aircraft engines, and China has used its supply chain
dominance as geopolitical leverage, including by threatening a rare earths embargo to
the U.S. during the height of the trade war between the two countries in 2019.
In 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense signed an agreement with Lynas, the world’s
largest rare earths mining and processing company outside China, to construct the
Texas processing facility.
In early June 2022, the Canadian rare earths miner Appia announced the discovery of
a new rare earths bearing zone in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Similarly, the
American rare earths supplier USA Rare Earth announced plans for a rare earths
processing facility in Oklahoma in mid-June. Both statements prompted further activity
from DRAGONBRIDGE in response.
We note that further information operations activity in a similar vein may narrowly target
other specific industries or companies that may be relevant to the PRC’s strategic
interests, beyond the promotion of geopolitical narratives in line with PRC political
interests.
The campaign leveraged more nuanced tactics than what we typically see from pro-PRC
information operations.
The campaign used inauthentic social media and forum accounts, including those
posing as residents in Texas to feign concern over environmental and health issues
surrounding the plant, including via posts to a public social media group predisposed to
be receptive to that content.
These accounts also leveraged criticism of Biden’s invocation of the Defense
Production Act by real individuals, including U.S. politicians of both parties, to amplify
campaign narratives.
While the activity we detail here does not appear to have been particularly effective and
received only limited engagement by seemingly real individuals, the campaign’s
microtargeting of specific audiences suggest the possibility of using similar means to
manipulate public discourse surrounding other U.S. political issues to the PRC’s
advantage.

DRAGONBRIDGE Accounts, Including Those Posing as Local Residents,
Protested the Planned Construction of Lynas Rare Earths Processing
Facility in Texas
Mandiant identified what we assess with high confidence to be DRAGONBRIDGE accounts
on multiple social media platforms and at least one forum, including those posing as
concerned residents protesting Lynas’ planned construction of a rare earths processing
facility in Texas (Figure 1). The accounts claimed that by placing the Lynas plant in Texas,
the Biden administration would expose the area to irreversible environmental damage and
the local population to radioactive contamination and adverse health effects such as cancer
risks, gene mutation, and deformities in newborns (Figure 2).
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts, including those claiming to be from Texas, posted content
critical of Lynas to the public Facebook group “STOP LYNAS! NO to Lynas Exporting
and Creating Another Toxic Legacy.”
Notably, some of the Facebook posts by DRAGONBRIDGE accounts appear to have
received limited engagement in the form of likes and comments by seemingly authentic
accounts in the group.
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts on Twitter likewise posted comments implying that they
were locals and Americans.

We observed accounts post primarily in English, with an additional lesser amount of content
in Chinese. Additionally, we observed extremely limited messaging in Malay, and
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts promoted photos of demonstrations against Lynas that took
place in Malaysia sometime between 2012 and 2019, due to controversy surrounding the
disposal of radioactive waste produced by its rare earths processing facility in the city of
Kuantan. We also observed accounts call for Malaysians to boycott Lynas, a further
indication of the campaign’s interest in specifically targeting the rare earths mining company
(Figure 3).

Activity Includes Quote-Tweeting of U.S. Politicians Negatively Commenting
on Biden’s Invocation of Defense Production Act, Use of Related Hashtags
Accounts leveraged commentary by real individuals, such as U.S. politicians and
commentators, to support their arguments against Lynas, its planned processing facility in
Texas, and the Biden administration’s decision to expedite production of critical minerals. For
example, accounts reposted criticism of Biden’s invocation of the Defense Production Act
from individuals on both ends of the U.S. political spectrum. Others responded to posts
regarding Lynas with additional negative messaging targeting the company.
Hashtags Used by DRAGONBRIDGE Accounts to Promote Messaging Surrounding
Lynas
We identified the use of the following hashtags by DRAGONBRIDGE accounts:
In English: #lynas, #rareearth, #minerals, #australia, #news, #rareearthminerals,
#lynasgetout. We note that these hashtags are also used by authentic accounts.
In Chinese: #lynas是污染源, #孩子需要健康的水源, #请停止和莱纳斯的合作, #lynas公
司用人当白鼠 (Translation: #lynas is a source of pollution, #children need a healthy
water source, #please stop cooperating with Lynas, #lynas corporation uses people as
guinea pigs)
Accounts Begin Targeting of Additional Rare Earths Mining and Manufacturing
Companies Appia, USA Rare Earth in June

6/10

In June, additional DRAGONBRIDGE social media accounts began targeting two additional
rare earths mining and manufacturing companies, the Canadian rare earths mining company
Appia Rare Earths & Uranium Corp and the American rare earths supplier USA Rare Earth.
Accounts acted in response to announcements made by the respective companies regarding
potential or planned operations, echoing previous criticisms centering around alleged
environmental and labor concerns. Notably, DRAGONBRIDGE’s targeting of additional rare
earths mining companies underscores the campaign’s ability to monitor developments and
respond accordingly, as well as its investment in attempting to ensure the PRC’s market
dominance in the industry.
DRAGONBRIDGE accounts targeted Appia with negative messaging in response to
the company’s announcement on June 1 that it had discovered a new rare earths
bearing zone in Saskatchewan, Canada. As with the planned Lynas facility in Texas,
accounts professed concern for the environmental implications of Appia’s actions and
the health of its workers.
Following USA Rare Earth’s announcement of a planned rare earths manufacturing facility in
Oklahoma on June 9, DRAGONBRIDGE reiterated concerns surrounding the alleged impact
of rare earths mining and processing, highlighting similar themes on the risks involved.

Newly Identified Accounts Posted Known DRAGONBRIDGE Content,
Highlighting Attribution to Campaign
We observed multiple newly identified accounts promote the same content as previously
identified DRAGONBRIDGE accounts both prior to and following their promotion of content
pertaining to Lynas. This includes content critical of the Chinese businessman Guo Wengui
(Miles Kwok), former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, and Chinese virologist Dr.
Yan Limeng, as well as narratives pertaining to the origin of COVID-19 (Figure 5). For
example, accounts promoted a report we judged to be falsely attributed to the Milk Tea
Alliance, a pro-democracy network consisting primarily of netizens in Asia, which put forth
multiple theories on the origin of COVID-19. We have previously noted both criticism of these
specific individuals and COVID-19 origin theories as common themes in the
DRAGONBRIDGE campaign.

As with other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts we have previously identified, the newly identified
accounts in this activity set have shown similar indicators of inauthenticity and coordination.
For example, accounts used profile photos appropriated from various online sources,
including stock photography, animals, and cartoons, suggesting that they sought to
obfuscate their identities; most of the Twitter accounts were created in clusters between
March and June 2022, suggesting possible batch creation of the accounts, a tactic we have
previously observed with this campaign. Many of the usernames consisted of Englishlanguage names followed by seemingly random numeric strings. In addition to the accounts’
posting of identical or similar rare earths-related content, we also observed some of the
accounts post identical or similar apolitical content, such as inspirational quotes, wellness,
travel, and sports content.

Figure 5: Sample tweets by accounts included narratives promoted by previously identified
DRAGONBRIDGE activity, along with narratives critical of Lynas

Outlook
DRAGONBRIDGE’s targeting of the rare earths industry broadly, and Lynas, Appia, and USA
Rare Earth specifically, demonstrates an interest in industries of strategic importance to the
PRC that we had not previously observed from the campaign. Given Chinese President Xi
Jinping’s continued emphasis on a broad, holistic understanding of PRC national security
that encompasses areas including information and resource security, we may see other
global competitors to PRC firms in other industries targeted by such information operations.

Additionally, the DRAGONBRIDGE campaign has in this activity set demonstrated the use of
incrementally more sophisticated tactics, such as the microtargeting of audiences favorable
to its messaging and the leveraging of criticism by real individuals to support its narratives
and agenda. However, its poor execution remains a limiting factor in the campaign’s ability to
effectively garner significant engagement. We previously reported on the campaign’s
attempts to physically mobilize protesters in the U.S. in September 2021, and noted then that
the campaign was unsuccessful in doing so. DRAGONBRIDGE’s recent activity attempts to
incite protests against the Lynas facility in Texas in particular shows a similar interest in
influencing real-world activity to achieve its objectives, and a similar failure in such attempts.
