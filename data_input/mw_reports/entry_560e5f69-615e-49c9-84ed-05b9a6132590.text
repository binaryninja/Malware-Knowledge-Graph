Saber lion organization (APT-C-38) attack activity
revealed
I. Overview
Since July 2015, the Army Lions Organization (APT-C-38) has launched an organized,
planned and targeted uninterrupted attack in the Middle East. Its attack platform is
Windows and Android. Up to now, 360 Beaconlab has captured 25 Android platform
attack samples, 4 Windows platform attack samples, and 16 C2 domain names.
In May 2018, Kaspersky security vendor published the report " Who's who in the Zoo ",
the ﬁrst time to disclose the organization as an unafﬁliated espionage organization
focused on the Middle East target, and named ZooPark, the attack weapon involved
contains four iterations The version of the Android-side RAT, load delivery methods
include puddles and Telegram channels.
In 2019, 360 Campﬁre Lab captured the latest attack activity of the Saber Lions
organization. In addition to discovering Android-side attacks, it also found that the
organization had Windows-side attacks, and the Android-side RAT still belongs to the
fourth generation. We combine the geopolitical factors of the APT attack, the language
used by the attacking organization, and the historical attack activities initiated by the
organization. The analysis considers the organization to be an APT organization in the
background of a country in the Middle East in West Asia. In addition, we would like to
thank our brother team----360 Advanced Threat Response Team for the completion
of the Windows side RAT content of this report.
Because of the main target of the Saber-Like organization, the Kurdish target is a
Kurdish country in the Middle East and West Asia. In addition, the Windows side RAT
contains multiple "Saber" under the PDB path, and the Asian lion is the representative
animal of the Middle East. Some of the other characteristics of the organization and the
360 naming rules for the APT organization, we named the organization the Saber Lion
(APT-C-38).

Second, load delivery and network infrastructure
The way the saber lion organizes the payload delivery is mainly the puddle attack and
the Telegram channel. It should be noted that after the organization was ﬁrst leaked in
early May 2018, the attacking organization used a new batch of network infrastructure at
the end of the month.
- Puddle attack
Two Arab news newspaper websites (Annahar, Kuwait and Al-Nahar, Egypt), which are
popular in the Middle East, have been found to have been used by the organization for
puddle attacks.

- Telegram channel
In addition to the above two puddle attacks against the designated Arab countries in the
Middle East, we also found that the organization used the Telegram channel to spread
the Kurdish people in the Middle East when attacking its main target (such as the
election of the Kurdistan Province before the Islamic Parliament). Attacks and attacks in
the Kurwana Nanda quarter of Kurdistan Province, etc.).

It should be noted that on May 23, 2018, a new batch of network infrastructure was
applied. The latest mobile attack load was deployed in one of the servers in March 2019.
There are 4 intermediate servers and 3 of them. It still survives and resolves to the same
IP, and these servers act as intermediate servers for the PC and mobile RATs.

organization in the month after being disclosed

Third, the way of induction
The Saber lion organization mainly uses the following two induction methods in this
operation:
- Camouﬂage with normal APP function
For better avoidance, it is noticed that in addition to masquerading the ﬁle icon, the
normal APP interface will be displayed when the RAT starts. Currently, the four-initiative
version of the Android RAT will display the normal interface after running, but Espionage
in the background is turned on at runtime or when a speciﬁed broadcast is received.

Fourth, RAT attack sample analysis
As of now, the Saber has been using different RATs for Android and Windows platforms.
After analysis, we believe that the latest Android RAT and PC RAT should be purchased
from the same commercial development organization, one of the developers nicknamed
"Apasec ".
- Android
The Android side uses a total of four iterations of the RAT. In this report, we only
introduce the fourth-generation RAT used by the latest attack activities. We are called
UnitMM. The RAT is currently only available in the saber lion organization. For other
versions of the RAT, refer to the information. The Kaspersky Security Vendor Report
mentioned earlier in this report.

The fourth generation RAT of the UnitMM Saber Lion organization. We named it UnitMM
based on the class name and database name used by the RAT. The latest version of
UnitMM controls dozens of feature conﬁgurations to steal SMS, contacts, geolocation,
browser bookmarks and search history, clipboard information, externally speciﬁed
application data, capture photos/video/audio A variety of malicious behaviors.
In addition, UnitMM can also interact in response to speciﬁed instructions from C2.

A RAT has been discovered on the Windows side. We have been named SpecialSaber.
The RAT is currently only available in the Army Lions organization, with a total of four.
SpecialSaber This is a RAT that has not been exposed before. According to the directory
name under the latest version of the PDB path, we are named SpecialSaber. It has
detection and killing (including Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Avira, Avast, AVG, ClamWin,
ESET, Norton, McAfee, Panda, Symantec), stealing a variety of browser information, a
variety of mailbox information, user account information, disk ﬁle information, etc. With a
variety of malicious behaviors such as keyloggers and screenshots. After stealing
various information, it will be saved in the ﬁle's own working directory. The ﬁle name is
randomly generated š string, and the ﬁle is stored in the speciﬁed format.

- Suspected to be purchased from the same commercial development company
By comparing the UnitMM RAT on the Android side with the SpecialSaber RAT on the
Windows side, we see that the two adopt a similar approach in the C2 communication
link, and the information stolen by the two has a special commonality. We think that the
two should come from the same business. Development organization.
In addition, we found a developer named "Apasec" in the path of a PDB. We found that
the name appeared in the C2 panels of the organization's mobile terminal many times.
This ﬁnding further veriﬁes our judgment.

V. Distribution of the attacked area
Up to now, 360 Campﬁre Labs has found that there are 7 countries affected by the attack
of the Saber Lions, of which Iran is the most affected. This is related to the attack on the
Kurds who found the country during our analysis. It doesn't matter.

Sixth, the attacker portrait
Based on the attacker's special attacks on the attack, the language used, and the
geopolitical factors of the APT attack, we summarized the following views of the attack
organization:
Familiar with Persian, Arabic, with Persian being the most frequently used.
It is mainly aimed at Kurdish people in a certain province in the Middle East in
West Asia. It can deploy attacks on activities at certain moments in real time and
even in advance, and it also targets several Arab countries in the Middle East.
APT attacks are mostly based on internal and geopolitical factors (national or
hostile).
From the perspective of the victim's background and the duration of the attack, the
target of the attacker's focus is signiﬁcant at the political and strategic level and
lasts longer.
In summary, 360 Campﬁre Lab believes that the attacker is an APT organization from a
country in the Middle East in West Asia.

Seven, summary
In recent years, we have seen that APT attacks have evolved with the times. The PC
side is no longer a unique target. More and more attack organizations will also use the
mobile end as another necessary target for attacks, and even invest frequently. The
cyber war under the background of some countries in the Middle East and the AsiaPaciﬁc region.
APT attacks are developing rapidly, especially the development of mobile attacks. We
have seen that some of the attacking organizations in the past few years are still
relatively rudimentary. Even some security vendors use kittens and other names to name
them to show low respect for the attacking capabilities of the corresponding attacking
organizations. However, as the attack gains value and the attack organization increases
its investment, we see that the attack is more and more complex, and the pertinence and
effectiveness are getting stronger. If the former kitten is used as an example, it is like a
young one. The kitten gradually became a mature lion. This saber lion organization is
undoubtedly a typical representative of the development of APT attacks. Based on the
special background of the organization and the current situation of its afﬁliated countries,
we believe that the organization's attack may have a new round of changes.
