Albany International Airport's staff announced that the New York airport's administrative
servers were hit by Sodinokibi Ransomware following a cyberattack that took place over
Christmas.
Airport operations were not impacted by the ransomware attack and customers' financial or
personal information was not accessed by the attackers according to a statement from
airport officials per WNYT-TV.
No airline or TSA servers were affected in the incident, with airport officials saying that the
vast majority of encrypted files being administrative documents and archived data.
The Albany County Airport Authority alerted the FBI and the New York State Cyber
Command as soon as the attack was discovered, and also hired the services of ABS
Solutions to help with the investigation.

MSP's breached systems used as a stepping stone
The attackers were able to infiltrate the New York airport's systems through the
maintenance server of its managed service provider (MSP) Logical Net, a Schenectady, NYbased data center services and hosted cloud solutions provider.

The Sodinokibi Ransomware malware spread through the Albany County Airport Authority's
network and also reached the backup servers.
Following the attack, airport CEO Philip Calderone told Times Union that "We have severed
our relationship with LogicalNet."
Left without backups, the airport paid the "under six figures" ransom the attackers
demanded. Albany International Airport's insurer reimbursed part of the ransom payment,
with a $25,000 deductible to be recovered from Logical Net.
"Thanks to the fast action by our IT department, airport operations during one of the busiest
travel periods of the year were not impacted and no passenger or airline data was acquired
or accessed," Calderone added.
"Within hours the authority was able to resume all administrative functions with systems
functioning as normal. We are grateful for the assistance provided by the New York State
Cyber Command, the FBI and our consultant ABS."
BleepingComputer has contacted the Albany International Airport, Logical Net, and the
Sodinokibi actors asking for more details but has not yet heard back.

High-profile Sodinokibi victims
International foreign currency exchange Travelex is another company hit by Sodinokibi on
New Year's Eve, with the company being forced to shut down all its systems "to protect data
and prevent the spread of the virus."
Following the complete systems shut down, customers were unable to use the site or the
app for transactions at around 1,500 Travelex locations across the world.
While Travelex said in a statement that there is no evidence that any of its data was stolen
in the attack, the Sodinokibi crew later told BleepingComputer that they copied over 5GB of
personal and financial data, including but not limited to names, dates of birth, social security
numbers, payment card info.
They also said that Travelex's backup files were also deleted and they will start publishing
the stolen data if the company doesn't pay the $3 million ransom in seven days.
U.S. data center provider CyrusOne also had some of its systems encrypted by Sodinokibi
Ransomware in early December 2019, while hundreds of dental practices using the online
backup product DDS Safe had their files locked in August after the software's developer got
infected through its cloud management provider, PercSoft.
