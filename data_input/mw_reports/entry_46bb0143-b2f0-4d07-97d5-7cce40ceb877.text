ESET assess the differences between CryptoFortress and TorrentLocker: two very different
strains of ransomware.
Last week, Kafeine published a blog post about a ransomware being distributed by the
Nuclear Pack exploit kit. This ransomware identify itself as “CryptoFortress”, but the ransom
message and payment page both looks like an already known ransomware: TorrentLocker.
After further analysis, ESET researchers found out is the two threats are in fact very different.
It appears the group behind CryptoFortress has stolen the HTML templates with its
CSS. The malware code and the scheme are actually very different. Here is a table
summering the similarities and differences:

Last Friday, Renaud Tabary from Lexsi published a complete analysis of the new ransomware.
ESET researchers have independently analyzed the CryptoFortress samples before Lexsi
released the details. The technical details described in the article matches our findings.

ESET Telemetry also shows TorrentLocker campaign is still propagating via spam messages.
Both campaign are now running in parallel.
