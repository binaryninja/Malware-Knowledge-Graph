On Oct. 19, 2020, when this latest Trickbot sample was distributed, none of the above listed
control servers were able to respond to Trickbot bot requests, a state that continued at the
time of this report. Intel 471 believes disruption operations against Trickbot are currently
global in nature and have had success against Trickbot infrastructure. Regardless, there still
is a small number of working controllers based in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and
Kyrgyzstan that still are able to respond to Trickbot bot requests. This small number of
working control servers was not listed in the most recent distributed Trickbot sample.
