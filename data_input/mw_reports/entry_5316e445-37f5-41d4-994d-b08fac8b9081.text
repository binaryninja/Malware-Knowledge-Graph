xylibox.com/2016/02/citadel-0011-atmos.html

Guys of JPCERT, 有難う御座います！
Released an update to their Citadel decrypter to make it compatible with 0.0.1.1 sample.

Citadel 0.0.1.1 don't have a lot of documentation, so time as come to talk about it.
Personally i know this malware under the name 'Atmos' (be ready for name war in 3,2,1...)
The first sample i was aware is the one spotted by tilldenis here in jully 2015.

'netstat' output]
close_browsers [close all browser processes]
And one part related to some new features:
Q: How does Mailer works?
A: This feature allows you to create mass-email campaigns using standard PHP tools.
For this feature to work correctly you need to download the script [Download Script] and put
it in www-root directory on one of the hosts that will be used to perform the mass-email
campaign - make sure you turn off the following in php.ini; magic_quotes_gpc = Off and
safe_mode = Off
After that press [ Config ] and fill in [Master E-Mail (for checkup) parameters: "name ; email"
Your email for checking] and Mailer-script URL: http://www.host.com/mailer.php
It's possible to create a campaign using a email address list collected by a Bot using "For
BotID" button or a new list name;email
Macros are supported in в Subject/Body/Attach.
{name} - Receiver name | {email} - Receiver E-mail | {random} - random chars | {rand0m} random long number
Recommendation: To avoid being blocked by spam-filters use macro name@{hostname} in
Sender ("email" or "name ; email") field - in this case the real domain name of the sending
host will be used and your emails will not end up in Spam folder.
Q: How to work with File Hunter feature?
A: This feature allows you to work with files on the bot: get list of files matching the
parameters specified under config entry "FileSearch", track files updates, autoupload files
and replace files on the bot.
Custom Download - allows you to download any file from a bot by BotID, taken that a full
path to the file is known. This will work even if the file is not specified under "FileSearch"
config entry.
Auto download - uploads files with a given mask without a need to specify BotID. Bot will
execute the upload as soon as search conditions are given and the file found. This will work
even if the file is not specified under "FileSearch" config entry.
Be careful using File Hunter to modify any files on the bot. It's main purpose is to grab *coin
files(multibit.dat/litecoin.dat...)
Use mouse right-click to access context menu for file list.
Q: Short manual for FTP Iframer
A: As in the case with 'Mailer', For this feature to work correctly you need to download the
iframer script [Download Script] and put it in www-root directory on one of the hosts that will
be used to perform the mass-email campaign - make sure you turn off the following in
php.ini; magic_quotes_gpc = Off and safe_mode = Off
Next, create configuration options by pressing on [ Конфигурация ]
Specify the script URL in URL field

5/61

Working mode: Just checking [ Will check the validity of FTP accounts found in the logs ]
Inject: [Mode: "ON"]
Inject method: Smart/Add/Overwrite [ Smart - will re-add the inject in case if it was detected
and deleted. / Add - iframe code will be added to the end of the file before </body></html>]
Lookup depth: [ File search level on ftp-host. For example, in the following structure FTP
Connection > public_html(1) > images(2) > gif(3)....]
Next, perform 'Accounts search' and 'Run tasks'. The statistics and results will be available
after a few minutes. The script will be working in cron-mode after the first execution, so there
is no need to keep the page opened.
Q: Main functions and methods of "Neuromodel"
A: Neuromodel allows you to perform complex analysis of your botnet: identifying best bots,
upload success rates. You can build a research matrix that includes list of bots and evaluate
them against specified criteria; the result will be calculating a score to each bot.
Each research matrix can contain a number of evaluation criteria. For example, you need to
search the logs for the following data: Bank Acc + CC or Bank Acc + ISP E-mail
Create profile first and then plan the task based on required criteria.
Task - "Find bots that logged into http://www.bankofamerica.com id=* in the last 30 days and
where McAfee is installed. Assign X score if the search criteria match"
Creating criteria:
1) { name: BOA LOGIN | criteria: HTTP data POST | URL masks:
htt*://www.bankofamerica.com/* | POST data masks: id=* | days limit: 30 | score: 1 | static
method, trigger condition: No < 1 }
2) { name: AVCheck | criteria: installed software | software name mask: McAfee* | days limit:
30 | score: 1 trigger condition: No < 1 }
Static method is used to summarize the results.
* **No**: simple summary. Each successful criteria match adds specified score to the bot.
More matches = bigger the score.
Example 1: if it found 180 reports matching the criteria and the score is 2 then the final score
will be '180*2'
Example 2: if 'Login to bankofamerica' criteria is set to ">=" "3" on average a day then the
score will be added only for the last days specified in 'Days' parameter.
Detailed: if in the last days specified in 'Days' parameter the 'Login to bankofamerica' criteria
was matched more than 3 times on average then the bots reported will be given the score
points.
* **Sum** Summary of produced reports
Score 'Points' will be added if the amount of reports satisfying the search criteria complies
with trigger condition.
For example, if we have `reports_count=180` and `Points=2` and trigger condition is `>= 180`
then the score is +2.
* **Days**: active days summary: days containing the reports.
6/61

Score will be added if the amount of reports satisfying the search criteria complies with
trigger condition.
For example, if we have reports from day before yesterday, yesterday and today and trigger
condition is set to `>= 3` then the scores will be added.
* **Avg/Day**: Average/Day: average number of reports in the last 24 hours
* **Avg/Week**: Average/Week: average number of reports per week
* **Days/Week**: average number of active days per week
Another example, search for inactive accounts:
"Find the bots regardless of their scores that logged into USBank in the last 21 days no more
than 3 times - no filters or criteria are applied"
1) { URL = https://onlinebanking.usbank.com/Auth/Login/Login* | HTTP URL visit| days limit
= 21 | Login no more than 3 times: e.g. login <=3. Meaning, if found <=3 reports for this
criteria — add 1 to the score. | SUM() <=3 , 1 score }
Full criteria list is below:
Condition using date/time of the first report received from the bot.
Condition using date/time of the last report received from the bot.
Condition using average online time of the bot per week or per hour.
Condition using a type of the report or it's content
>Presence/Lack of LUHN10(CC)
>Presence/Lack of ISP email address (pop3 or web-link)
>Presence/Lack of FTP accounts
>Search by key words
Condition using "Installed Software" reports, allows you to check for a particular software
installed on the bot.
Condition using "CMD" reports, allows to use particular keywords.
Condition using visited one or many particular URLs
Condition using POST variables.
