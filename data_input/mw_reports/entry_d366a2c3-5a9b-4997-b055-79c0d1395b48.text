Connected TV (CTV) provides massive opportunities for streaming services and brands to
engage with consumers through compelling content and advertising. Because of this opportunity,
it is incredibly important for the CTV ecosystem and brands to work together through a collectively
protected advertising supply chain to ensure fraud is recognized, addressed and eliminated as
quickly as possible as bad actors always follow the money. Ad fraud can happen when you buy
inventory through unprotected channels. Ad fraud can be eliminated quickly through protected
channels where there are direct relationships, trust, and full transparency. Working together
through a collectively protected supply chain will ensure the ecosystem realizes the full beneﬁts of
creating a great CTV customer experience that is ad fraud free.
A new CTV ad fraud operation—named ICEBUCKET—started in a part of programmatic
advertising where the supply chain is less transparent, sellers are not reported in sellers.json ﬁles,
and buyers and sellers typically don't have a direct relationship. The bad actors behind
ICEBUCKET had a good thing going until they tried to expand and scale their efforts, including
the partners we protect. However, by working with our partners, we blocked the attack, protected
and shared data across our partner network, and improved the efﬁcacy of our platform to ensure
we stay ahead of ad fraud and the bad actors behind it. Our success speaks to the long-term
planning, processes, and practices in place between us and our partners.
The White Ops Satori Threat Intelligence and Research team recently uncovered the largest and
widest Connected TV (CTV) related fraud operation to date. At its peak, the ICEBUCKET bot
operation impersonated more than 2 million people in over 30 countries. The operation
counterfeited over 300 different publishers, stealing advertising spend by tricking advertisers into
thinking there were real people on the other side of the screen, when in reality, these were bots
pretending to be real people watching TV. The operation hid its sophisticated bots within the

limited signal and transparency of server side ad insertion (SSAI) backed video ad impressions.
The White Ops Bot Mitigation Platform is able to detect this fraud scheme and protect partners
from falling victim to this operation, and similar ones.
Here are the details on how the ICEBUCKET operation was detected and stopped from impacting
a collectively protected supply chain. In an effort to further protect advertisers, we lay out our
recommendations to the CTV ecosystem and brands to remain fraud free.

One Ice, Two Ice, 28% Ice
The ICEBUCKET operation is the largest case of SSAI spooﬁng that has been uncovered to date.
According to our internal data, near its peak nearly 28% of the programmatic CTV trafﬁc White
Ops has visibility into, or around 1.9 billion ad requests per day for the month of January
came from this single operation.

Figure 1: percentage of programmatic CTV trafﬁc implicated in this operation for January 2020.
In January 2020, 66% of programmatic CTV-related SSAI trafﬁc and 15% of programmatic
mobile-related SSAI trafﬁc that White Ops protects was a part of this scheme. When we look at
the devices the operation used, we see various CTV devices alongside the mobile trafﬁc. The top
spoofed devices in this scheme are given below. Some of the devices that the fraudsters spoofed
in this operation are from discontinued product lines. White Ops provided information into this
threat to Roku, which allowed them to check the results against their internal systems. They
conﬁrmed the spooﬁng nature of the operation, as there was no ICEBUCKET activity on the Roku
platform.

This operation masqueraded SSAI servers by
generating trafﬁc for ﬁctional edge devices
(speciﬁcally CTV and mobile devices) into the
ad tech ecosystem. To do this, the operation
used:
More than 1,000 different user-agents,
around 500 of which only appear in this
operation
More than 300 different appIDs from various publishers
At least 2 million spoofed IP addresses from 30+ countries, where over 99% of those
addresses are located in the United States
About 1,700 SSAI server IPs located in 9 countries generating the trafﬁc
In order to fully understand the magnitude of the ICEBUCKET operation, it’s important to have a
sense of how SSAI works, the role it plays in programmatic advertising on CTV platforms, why
SSAI spooﬁng is so difﬁcult to detect, and what makes SSAI spooﬁng such an attractive target for
fraudsters.

What is server-side ad insertion (SSAI)?
Server-side ad insertion, or SSAI, was developed by publishers to create a better end-user ad
experience. Ads are “stitched” into the fabric of video content so that there aren’t delays or
hiccups caused by launching an ad player. SSAI is commonly used for advertising on several
“edge” device types, such as CTVs, smart phones, gaming consoles, and others. Delivering video
ad content through SSAI offers advertisers many beneﬁts, including user personalization and
latency reduction.

Figure 2: Schematic of how SSAI spooﬁng relates to the ad tech ecosystem
While SSAI is an elegant solution to ad serving, it’s still in its infancy. As with all new technologies,
White Ops can see fraudsters ﬁnding the holes in the system and wiggling their way through.
Fraudsters have found a way to spoof edge devices to replicate SSAI services.

SSAI spooﬁng, the key fraud technique that ICEBUCKET’s operators used, occurs when
fraudsters send out a bunch of ad requests from data centers for “spoofed” or faked edge
devices. The data center source is expected for real SSAI providers. Rather than show the ads to
humans, the fraudsters call the reporting APIs indicating the ad has been “shown”. Often, the
information available to advertisers in an SSAI environment is limited to the device user-agent
and IP address. This information may be sent in the “X-Device-User-Agent” and “X-Device-IP”
HTTP headers, as per the IAB VAST guidelines, or through other similar headers. While falsifying
this data is relatively simple, the nuance of doing so convincingly makes this a form of a
sophisticated bot attack.
Advertisers pay for their ads to be viewed by a human audience that are open to their products or
services. Instead, these fraudsters take the advertisers’ money and pocket it; the ads that are
“served” either never see the light of day or are never viewed by a human. An audience of
sophisticated bots is really just an empty audience.

The ICEBUCKET Operation
The ICEBUCKET operation presented its trafﬁc as coming from a legitimate SSAI provider (based
on the inclusion of standard HTTP headers) for a variety of devices and apps, using custom code.
ICEBUCKET assembled requests for ads to be inserted into video content for viewers using CTV
and mobile devices, but none of those devices or viewers actually exist. The user-agents used in
the operation largely refer to obsolete device types that are no longer used in the general
population, or devices that never existed in the ﬁrst place. The IP addresses showed signs of
being algorithmically generated to mimic desirable audiences.
These ad requests originated from a small set of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).
Autonomous Systems make up the back-end routing infrastructure of the internet, in the same
way that roads connect trafﬁc between different cities. Each system is identiﬁed with a number,
the ASN, similar in function to a postal code. While we can’t know for sure the threat actor’s
motivation for using these ASNs in the operation, we can make a few comments on possible
reasons. The ASNs have:
Weak enforcement from network operators regarding malicious activity conducted from
their data center
Cheap Virtual Private Server (VPS) services available
A large number of hosts within that IP space that are vulnerable or otherwise left open for
exploitation
It is likely the actor behind ICEBUCKET operated from these ASNs due to their conﬁdence that
their behavior would not be caught. Not all trafﬁc from these ASNs are part of the ICEBUCKET
operation, as there is non-ICEBUCKET trafﬁc from these ASNs as well.
The ICEBUCKET operation is unique in that a subset of the trafﬁc is being generated to beneﬁt
app publishers directly through direct deals. We've observed cases where such publishers are
mixing up organic and ICEBUCKET trafﬁc in what seems to be early signs of trafﬁc sourcing
schemes for CTV trafﬁc. From our observation of this “mixed up” trafﬁc, we have two hypothesis
as to why this would occur:

Hiding the operation: By creating a subset of trafﬁc that is not beneﬁting the operation
directly, the fraudsters have created noise around identifying the operation. The spoofed
apps are then unwitting beneﬁciaries to the generated trafﬁc.
Fraud-as-a-service: The operation is generating trafﬁc on behalf of the app publishers.
The subset of fraudulent activity becomes harder to detect, and the operation has an extra
revenue source for the scheme.
At this point, we cannot make a conclusive determination between these two possibilities. There
is the possibility that both of these options could be at play, depending on the particular subset of
the trafﬁc in question.

Freezing Fraudsters Out
The White Ops Bot Mitigation Platform allows us to protect our partners by stopping sophisticated
bots once we’ve accurately identiﬁed the signatures of the particular threat. By monitoring for
those threat signatures in our pre-bid trafﬁc, we can automatically block fraudulent trafﬁc and
ensure money does not go into the pockets of the fraudsters. The platform also allows us to
highlight those portions of the ad-tech ecosystem where this operation is ﬂourishing, so our
partners can take actions into their own hands.
Spooﬁng of any kind is designed to make the spoofed entity resemble the victim (a consumer, an
advertiser, an app developer - the target depends on the operation). Using several fraud markers,
we can distinguish between the real, human trafﬁc and the trafﬁc from these spoofed devices.
White Ops is careful not to negatively impact apps that are victims in fraud schemes just because
fraudsters are taking advantage of their appIDs. We work to cut the ﬂow of money to the actual
fraudsters, not the organizations they target.

As noted above, ICEBUCKET is an ongoing operation. The volumes shown in Figure 3 have not
gone down to zero. The fraudsters are still out there, but we are able to execute our bot mitigation
and bot prevention techniques to detect them and protect against their attacks; we’re disclosing
this discovery now so others can do the same. We have already rolled out defenses against

similar operations, and have expanded our collective protection coverage further into the
“purported SSAI” subset of our observed trafﬁc. Our detection and bot prevention techniques are
continually evolving to counter emergent threats, as well as to anticipate new ones.

Stopping the Ice Storm
Since CTV and SSAI spooﬁng are currently lucrative options for our adversaries due to the high
CPMs on CTV consumers, we expect to see similar operations start, or that existing operations
may shift from web and mobile toward CTV trafﬁc.
There are a couple things our peers in the industry can do to try to mitigate SSAI spooﬁng:
Ensure you work with a collectively protected advertising supply chain where there are
direct relationships, trust, and full transparency
Consistent appID/bundleID declarations to provide stronger links from app to publisher,
such as the IAB app identiﬁcation guidelines
Consult frequently with your ad tech partners throughout the ecosystem to ensure that this
new threat model is well understood by everybody in your orbit.
Develop more standards that will increase transparency for CTV inventory such as:
Expand the app-ads.txt standard to fully support CTV trafﬁc
Fully adopt sellers.json to support visibility into the entire supply chain
Device manufacturers and SSAI providers should support the development and
adoption of standards that verify the authenticity of a device (e.g. via
cryptographically signing their requests). This would be a great step forward at
combating device impersonation.
We’ve seen actions like this have a ripple effect. When the scheme becomes less proﬁtable, then
we have done our job: by cutting into the revenue streams of bad actors, we push them out of the
ecosystem. White Ops’ Advertising Integrity offering protects advertisers from falling victim to the
most sophisticated bot attacks on the internet.
Education on SSAI spooﬁng is just the beginning - teams need to start monitoring for this
behavior. The programmatic advertising ecosystem needs industry standards in order to “ice” out
these fraudsters once and for all.

Appendix
Subset of ASNs identiﬁed as the trafﬁc sources for this operation:
Not all trafﬁc from these ASNs are part of the ICEBUCKET operation, as there is nonICEBUCKET trafﬁc from these ASNs as well.
User-agents present: icebucket-uas.txt
Not all of the included user-agents are unique to the ICEBUCKET operation. Since the operation
is trying to look like legitimate trafﬁc, there are some devices represented here that will be seen
outside of this operation.
