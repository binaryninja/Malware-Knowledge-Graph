A sample of a potentially new ransomware called Erebus has been discovered by
MalwareHunterTeam on VirusTotal. I say that this is a potentially new ransomware because
TrendMicro had reported another ransomware using the same name was previously released
back in September 2016. Though I do not have a sample of the original Erebus, from its
outward characteristics, the one discovered today looks like either a complete rewrite or a
new ransomware using the same name..
While at this time, it is not currently known how Erebus is being distributed, analysis of the
ransomware shows some interesting features. The first, and most noticeable features, is the
low ransom amount of ~$90 USD being requested by the ransomware. Another interesting
features is its use of a UAC bypass that allows the ransomware to run at elevated privileges
without displaying a UAC prompt.

Erebus performs a UAC Bypass by Hijacking the MSC File
Association
When the installer for Erebus is executed, it will also utilize a User Account Control (UAC)
bypass method so that victim's will not be prompted to allow the program to run at higher
privileges. It does this by copying itself to a random named file in the same folder. It will then
modify the Windows registry in order to hijack the association for the .msc file extension so
that it will launch the random named Erebus executed instead.
The hijacked keys are shown below.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.msc
HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile
HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell
HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open
HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command
HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command\

%UserProfile%\[random].exe

Erebus will then execute eventvwr.exe (Event Viewer), which in turn will automatically open
the eventvwr.msc file. As the .msc file is no longer associated with mmc.exe, but now with the
random named Erebus executable, Event Viewer will launch Erebus instead. As Event Viewer
runs in a elevated mode, the launched Erebus executable will also launch with the same
privileges. This allows it to bypass User Account Control.
A big thanks to MalwareHunterTeam for pointing out the article that describes this bypass.

How Erebus Encrypts a Computer
When Erebus is executed it will connect to http://ipecho.net/plain and
http://ipinfo.io/country in order to determine the victim's IP address and country that they
are located in. It will then download a TOR client and use it to connect to the site's
Command & Control server.
Erebus will then begin to scan the victim's computer and search for certain file types. When it
detects a targeted file type, it will encrypt the file using AES encryption. The current list of
targeted files are:
.accdb, .arw, .bay, .cdr, .cer, .crt, .crw, .dbf, .dcr, .der, .dng, .doc, .docm,
.docx, .dwg, .dxf, .dxg, .eps, .erf, .indd, .jpe, .jpg, .kdc, .mdb, .mdf, .mef, .mrw,
.nef, .nrw, .odb, .odm, .odp, .ods, .odt, .orf, .pdd, .pef, .pem, .pfx, .png, .ppt,
.pptm, .pptx, .psd, .pst, .ptx, .raf, .raw, .rtf, .rwl, .srf, .srw, .txt, .wpd, .wps,
.xlk, .xls, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx

When Erebus encrypts a file, it will encrypt the extension using ROT-23. For example, a file
called test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed as test.msj.

Encrypted Files

During this process, Erebus will also clear the Windows Volume Shadow Copies so that they
cannot be used to recover files. The command executed to clear the shadow copies is:
cmd.exe /C vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet && exit

When it has finished encrypting the computer, it will display the ransom note located on the
Desktop called README.HTML. This ransom note will contain a unique ID that can be
used to login to the payment site, a list of encrypted files, and a button that takes you to the
TOR payment site.

Erebus will also display a message box on the Windows desktop alerting the victim that their
files are encrypted.

Message Box Alert

When a victim clicks on the Recover my files button, they will be brought to Erebus' TOR
payment site where they can get payment instructions. At this time the ransom amount is set
to .085 bitcoins, which is approximately $90 USD.

Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by Erebus for free. For

The registry change shouldn't work if registry is PW protected?!
Like in a domain where users are only users?
