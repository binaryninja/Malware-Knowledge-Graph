Season

Update December 17, 2020
Gift card scams are continuing, and the criminals continue to target well-known Apple's new
everything gift cards announced back in July. Instead of separate cards for iTunes or Apple
Store purchases, consumers can now purchase a single gift card and use the to purchase
products, accessories, games, music, movies, TV shows, iCloud, and more .
The site below leverages a typosquat attack and uses a URL that looks authentic and could
easily fool somebody. The user is prompted to enter their gift card number to check their
balance. Once they do, the site either hangs indefinitely or shows an error message. In
some cases, it displays an invalid number message. Unfortunately for the user, if they get
this far, it's already too late. The criminal has the gift card number and has either sold it on a
gift card exchange or used it to make a purchase of their own.

Apple Everything Gift Card Scam Site
Apple's new gift cards are likely to be a popular gift during this holiday season given the
company's slate of new products launched this year. In the past 90 days, Bolster Research
has found 1,645 phishing or scam Apple sites, and over 10,000 suspicious URLs that include
the word "apple." The sites are hosted in multiple countries with some of the more
interesting countries being the Russian Federation (588 sites), US Virgin Islands (75 sites),
and Ukraine (2 sites).
The sites are hosted on a number of top level domains (TLDs), which demonstrates the
problem companies face as more TLDs are created every year. The traditional defensive
method of proactive domain registrations is economically unfeasible given that a six letter
domain results in 1,200 variations. Bolster's has an extensive report and analysis of this
problem, which can be read here.

Top Level Domains Hosting Apple Phishing/Scam Sites
Original blog post December 8, 2020
2020 has been an unpredictable year for retail and online shopping, and analysts are very
cautious in their holiday season predictions The International Council of Shopping Centers
(ICSC) predicts a nominal 1.9% increase from 2019(1), where Deloitte predicts two possible
scenarios with retail holiday sales growth anywhere between 0% to 3.5%(2). Though the
faltering economy, high unemployment and surging COVID-19 infections are causing
anxious consumers to avoid brick and mortar stores, online shopping continues to rise.
Gift cards are one of most popular gifting options for the holidays, especially as e-gift cards
are now available by most major retailers including Amazon, Target and Best Buy. Research
firm Technavio forecasts a 13% compound annual growth rate for gift cards, driven by among
other things the growth of e-commerce, which has exploded during the pandemic. Cyber
criminals have taken notice and are launching specific online campaigns targeting gift cards.
Bolster research discovered a sharp rise in gift card scams as cyber criminals launch tactics
to take advantage of the giving season. The analysis uncovered two primary types of gift
card scams:
1. Check your gift card balance
These sites offer to help you check the balance of your gift cards but steal gift card
numbers from consumers.
2. Survey scams with gift card offer
These sites offer bogus free gift cards for completing surveys, which are used to collect
personal information which is sold for profit.

The data for this analysis was collected by the Bolster platform, which analyzes over one
million sites daily and uses a combination of deep learning, natural language processing and
computer vision to understand the intent of a site and make a determination whether it is a
phishing or scam site. The technology has a false positive rate of 1/100,000.

Gift Card Scams Explode
Bolster Research data shows that gift card scams first spiked in March and April as the
COVID-19 pandemic caused many countries to issue shelter in place orders, corresponding
with a sharp increase in e-commerce activity. After a brief lull in the summer, the data
illustrates a more dramatic spike in September, which has continued into November. The
large increase coincides with the early start of the holiday shopping season, including
Amazon Prime Day in mid-October. November experienced the highest rate of new gift card
scams with 6,881 total new sites, over 229 new sites per day and nearly 10X more new sites
created than those in January.

Nearly 10X Increase in New Scams Monthly

Retail and Gaming are Prime Targets
Among the categories, retail and gaming are the most often targeted by gift card scammers
going into the holiday season. In November, these two categories accounted for 59% of all
gift card scams found online. The large increase is driven by the popularity of these
categories during the holiday shopping season and the introduction of two highly anticipated
new gaming consoles from Microsoft and Sony.

Target experienced a dramatic increase in e-commerce sales during the pandemic. In
August, the company announced that its digital sales tripled with online purchases and
curbside pickup jumped by more than 700%(3). Not surprisingly, Target gift cards are one of
the more popular online scams discovered by Bolster Research.
The screenshot below illustrates a fraudulent Target gift card balance checker site. The
layout, text and colors are identical to the authentic Target gift card balance checking site,
which can be viewed here. Unsuspecting users can easily be tricked to enter their gift card
numbers. Once they enter the number, the site displays a never ending “checking balance”
status or some sort of error misleading users into thinking the site is malfunctioning. In reality,
the valid gift card numbers are harvested by the criminals and monetized by either reselling
them on other sites or using them to make purchases.

Fake Target Gift Card

Balance Checker Site (https://www.targetgiftscard[.]com/)
Though the criminals went to a lot of effort to make this appear authentic, there are signs that
this is not a legitimate Target site.
None of the other URLs work. Clicking on the links to sign in, search store locations,
or look at the weekly ads don’t function. The reason is because criminals do not want
their victims to leave the scam site. Linking to the real Target site would allow the users
to go to leave the site before entering their gift card numbers.
The URL utilizes a typosquatting attack, utilizing a carefully chosen URL to trick
users into believing it is an authentic Target site. The wording is slightly awkward
with “…giftScard.com” but this could be easily overlooked. Target does seem to own
“…giftcard.com” and “…giftcards.com.” These have been preemptively registered to
prevent this type of attack. However, this scam site shows the limitations of preemptive
domain registration as a defensive strategy. Bolster Research has an in-depth report
that discusses the challenges of fighting typosquatting attacks and the limitations of
preemptive domain registration.
More in-depth analysis, that would be typically beyond the technical abilities of the average
consumer, confirms that this is not a legitimate Target site.
The domain is registered to an entity in the state of Delhi, India. Target is a USbased company and would not register their domains in India.
The site is hosted in Singapore through GoDaddy.com. GoDaddy is a consumer
and small business service that is not used by large companies to host sites. Unless
serving a foreign market, US companies host their sites in the US for the best user
experience.
The IP address has been used for phishing sites in the past. This data is available
on Bolster’s free community service Checkphish.ai.

The IP address is shared with other non-Target Indian business sites such as
www.megabooster[.]in. Large multinational corporations like Target use their own IP
addresses and do not share them with other sites.
Bolster Research found other Target gift card scam sites that are less sophisticated and have
a lower probability of tricking users. The official Target logos and colors are not used, and the
text reads as the writer learned English as a second language. The main image looks like it
is the inside of a Target store. What is interesting, however, is that by avoiding the use of
Target’s official logo, this site is more likely to evade detection. Most brand protection
companies rely on the use of logos. Bolster discovered this site because its AI-driven
platform combines highly accurate computer vision and natural language processing to
assess the intent of the site, similar to how a human being would assess the site.

Gift Card Survey Scam
Gift card survey scams are also becoming more prolific . These sites claim they can check
for unused gift card codes. They offer these for free to users if they take the time to fill out a
short survey. The purpose of these sites appears to be the collection of personal and
demographic information that they will sell to companies or others that find this information
useful.
A single group looks to be behind hundreds of these scam sites using fake gift card offers
from AliExpress, Bath & Body Works, Forever 21, and many others. The URL pattern is
consistent and follows the template of https://[fake domain]/free-[brand name].html. For
example, the URLs below are examples of fake survey sites that look and operate exactly
the same except for the gift card brand being offered. Bolster Research has found more than
1,000 active survey scam sites that appear to be from the same perpetrator.

Gift Card Survey Scam Site

(https://cardspace.club/free-amazon-gift-cards[.]html)
At face value, these survey scams seem overly simple. However, many people have lost
their jobs or are struggling to survive financially, so it is not hard to imagine why people would
fall for these scams. The scam site itself is very sophisticated and masterfully creates a
sense of urgency to keep unsuspecting victims engaged. Once a gift card amount is
selected, the site displays visuals designed to make the victim believe that a database
search is occurring as in the screenshot below. The database search results in a success,
and a partial gift card code is revealed.

With the victim hooked, the site then proceeds to ask a series of survey questions to gather
information such as name, address, phone number and date of birth. The survey continues
to ask questions about spending habits, car insurance information, healthcare preferences,
among other things. During the survey, the victim is required to explicitly opt-in to receive
calls and text messages, even if they are listed on the federal or state do not call registry.

Explicit Opt-In Consent
Unfortunately for the user, there is no gift card at the end of the survey. What actually
happens is an endless set of surveys that cover more and more preferences and
demographic details. The victim is constantly encouraged to take one more survey for a

chance to win another gift card. It is obvious that the site was created by someone with an
understanding of human psychology and gamification to encourage victims to reveal more
and more personal information.

How to Avoid Gift Card Scams
As cyber criminals ramp up gift card scams this holiday season, there is a good chance the
average shopper will come across one of these campaigns. They could also receive a gift
card as a present and unknowingly fall victim to one of these scams. Shoppers can stay save
and avoid becoming a victim of these scams by following these helpful tips:
Always use the retailer’s site to check gift card balances. All retailers who offer gift
cards have pages on their websites that allow shoppers to check gift card balances.
Avoid checking your gift card balance on third party sites.
Go to a site by typing the retailer’s URL directly. Do not use a search engine such
as Google to find a gift card balance checker page. Scammers are known to deploy
search engine optimization tactics to rank high on search engine queries to lure
unsuspecting victims. Using a search engine could cause you to go to a fake URL that
closely resembles the real site.
Remember there are no free gift cards. Though it is tempting to believe that today is
your lucky day, nobody gives out free $50 gift cards for a few minutes of your time. The
logic is impossible.
