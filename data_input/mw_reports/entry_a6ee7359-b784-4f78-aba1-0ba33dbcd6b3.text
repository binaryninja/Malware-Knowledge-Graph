Qbot Likes to Move It, Move It

Qbot (aka QakBot, Quakbot, Pinkslipbot ) has been around for a long time having first been
observed back in 2007. More info on Qbot can be found at the following links: Microsoft
& Red Canary
In this case, from October 2021, we will break down how Qbot quickly spread across all
workstations in an environment, while stealing browser information and emails. While the
case is nearly 5 months old, Qbot infections in the past week have followed the same
pattern.

Case Summary
We did not observe the initial access for this case but assess with medium to high
confidence that a malicious email campaign was used to deliver an Excel (xls) document.
Following the opening of the xls document, the initial Qbot DLL loader was downloaded and
saved to disk. Interestingly, the name of the DLL contained a .html extension to disguise the
portable executable nature of the payload. Once executed, the Qbot process creates a
scheduled task to elevate itself to system.

1/21

Qbot injected into many processes but one favorite in this intrusion, was Microsoft Remote
Assistance (msra.exe). Within minutes of landing on the beachhead, a series of discovery
commands were executed using Microsoft utilities. Around the same time, LSASS was
access by Qbot to collect credentials from memory.
Thirty minutes after initial access, Qbot was observed collecting data from the beachhead
host including browser data and emails from Outlook. At around 50 minutes into the
infection, the beachhead host copied a Qbot dll to an adjacent workstation, which was then
executed by remotely creating a service. Minutes later, the beachhead host did the same
thing to another adjacent workstation and then another, and before we knew it, all
workstations in the environment were compromised.
Qbot followed it’s normal process on each machine. Servers were not accessed in this
intrusion. After this activity, normal beaconing occurred but no further actions on objectives
were seen.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Qbot, Cobalt Strike, BazarLoader, Covenant, Metasploit,
Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here.
We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as memory captures, files,
event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and
Organization services.

MITRE ATT&CK
Initial Access
3/21

We assess with medium to high confidence that the QBot infection was delivered to the
system via a malspam campaign through a hidden 4.0 Macro’s in Excel.
We believe this is the xls file that lead to the Qbot infection, due to the overlap in time period,
download url, and file name.

Execution
The QBot dll was executed on the system and shortly after, injected into the msra.exe
process.

Privilege Escalation
A scheduled task was created by Qbot to escalate to SYSTEM privileges. This scheduled
task was created by the msra.exe process, to be run only once, a few minutes after its
creation.

4/21

"schtasks.exe" /Create /RU "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" /tn juqpxmakfk /tr "regsvr32.exe -s
\"C:\Users\REDACTED\ocrafh.html\"" /SC ONCE /Z /ST 14:20 /ET 14:32

Defense Evasion
QBot was observed injecting into msra.exe process on multiple systems.

Multiple folders were added to the Windows Defender Exclusions list in order to prevent the
Qbot dll placed inside of it from being detected. The newly dropped dll was then executed
and process injected into msra.exe.

Qbot used reg.exe to add Defender folder exceptions for folders within AppData and
ProgramData.
C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe ADD \"HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft
Antimalware\Exclusions\Paths\" /f /t REG_DWORD /v
\"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Oweboiqnb\" /d \"0\"
C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe ADD \"HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
Defender\Exclusions\Paths\" /f /t REG_DWORD /v \"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Oweboiqnb\"
/d \"0\"

dll files dropped by Qbot, were deleted after injection into msra.exe.

Credential Access
LSASS was accessed by Qbot, with the intention of accessing credentials. This can be
observed through the Sysmon process access event, indicating the GrantedAccess value
of 0x1410 .
5/21

Additional evidence of LSASS access was visible in API calls from Qbot injected processes
to LSASS.

Discovery
The following discovery commands where observed coming from the Qbot processes. These
commands where executed on the beachhead system along with other workstations
compromised through lateral movement.
whoami /all
arp -a
cmd /c set
arp -a
net view /all
ipconfig /all
net view /all
nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=10 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.REDACTED
route print
net share
net1 localgroup
net localgroup
netstat -nao

Lateral Movement

6/21

Qbot moved laterally to all workstations in the environment by copying a dll to the machine
and then remotely creating a service to execute the Qbot dll. The services created had the
DeleteFlag set causing the service to be removed upon reboot.

The following occurred on each workstation:

7/21

The lateral movement activity from the beachhead host was rapid and connections were
seen across all workstations in the network. A view from the memory of the beachhead host
shows the injected msra process connecting to hosts across the network.

8/21

The service creations were also observed via event id 7045 across all hosts.

Collection
Qbot is widely known to steal emails with the intention of collecting information and
performing email thread hijacking.
Email data will be collected and stored in 1 of 2 locations.
C:\Users\Username\EmailStorage_ComputerHostname-Username_TimeStamp
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\EmailStorage_ComputerHostnameUsername_TimeStamp

Once exfiltrated from the system this folder is then deleted as seen below

cmd.exe /c rmdir /S /Q "C:\Users\REDACTED\EmailStorage_REDACTED-REDACTED_REDACTED"
cmd.exe /c rmdir /S /Q
"C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\EmailStorage_REDACTED-REDACTED_REDACTED"

9/21

Collection of browser data from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge was also observed with
Qbot using the built-in utility esentutl.exe.

esentutl.exe /r V01 /l"C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache"
/s"C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache"
/d"C:\Users\REDACTED\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache"

Command and Control
Qbot uses a tiered infrastructure, often using other compromised systems as first tier proxy
points for establishing a constantly changing list of C2 endpoints. You can review a in-depth
analysis of the modules of this malware in this Checkpoint report.
With this type of setup the list of C2 from October 2021, has in large rotated out of use. To
keep up to date on current Qbot C2 endpoints you can check out our Threat Feed & All Intel
service as we track these changing lists daily.
Qbot does use SSL in it’s C2 communication but does not rely soley on port 443 for
communication, in the case investigated here the following ports were found in the extracted
C2 configuration.
Count Port
88 443
25 995
17 2222
3 2078

1 50010
1 32100

1 1194

10/21

Qbot uses SSL and while the domains do not resolve, they follow a pattern and are
detectable with several Suricata ETPRO signatures.

Qbot JA3/S:
JA3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea, c35a61411ee5bdf666b4d64b05c29e64

Impact
The final actions of the threat actor were not observed, however, the data exfiltrated from the
network could be used to conduct further attacks or sold to 3rd parties.
