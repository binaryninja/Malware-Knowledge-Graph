Cobalt Strike Being Distributed to Vulnerable MS-SQL
Servers

February 21, 2022

The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered the distribution of Cobalt Strike targeting
MS-SQL servers that are vulnerable to malware attacks.
MS-SQL server is a typical database server of the Windows environment, and it has
consistently been a target of attack from the past. Attacks that target MS-SQL servers
include attacks to the environment where its vulnerability has not been patched, brute
forcing, and dictionary attack against poorly managed servers.
The attacker or the malware usually scans port 1433 to check for MS-SQL servers open to
the public. It then performs brute forcing or dictionary attacks against the admin account,
a.k.a. “sa” account to attempt logging in. Even if the MS-SQL server is not open to the
public, there are types such as Lemon Duck malware that scans port 1433 and spreads for
the purpose of lateral movement in the internal network.

Managing admin account credentials so that they’re vulnerable to brute forcing and
dictionary attacks as above or failing to change the credentials periodically may make the
MS-SQL server the main target of attackers. Other malware besides Lemon Duck that target
MS-SQL server includes CoinMiner malware such as Kingminer and Vollgar.
If the attacker succeeds to log in to the admin account through these processes, they use
various methods including the xp_cmdshell command to execute the command in the
infected system. Cobalt Strike that has recently been discovered was downloaded through
cmd.exe and powershell.exe via the MS-SQL process as shown below.

Figure 2. Process Tree
Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool, and it is recently being used as a
medium to dominate the internal system in the majority of attacks including APT and
ransomware. Malware that has recently been discovered is an injector that decodes the
encoded Cobalt Strike inside, and executes and injects the normal program MSBuild.exe.

Figure 3. Cobalt Strike settings data
Cobalt Strike that is executed in MSBuild.exe has an additional settings option to bypass
detection of security products, where it loads the normal dll wwanmm.dll, then writes and
executes a beacon in the memory area of the dll. As the beacon that receives the attacker’s
command and performs the malicious behavior does not exist in a suspicious memory area
and instead operates in the normal module wwanmm.dll, it can bypass memory-based
detection.

Figure 4. Shellcode and strings used for wwanmm.dll
Although it is not certain in which method the attacker dominated MS-SQL and installed the
malware, as the detection logs of Vollgar malware that was previously mentioned were
discovered, it can be assumed that the targeted system had inappropriately managed the
account credentials.

AhnLab’s ASD infrastructure shows numerous logs of Cobalt Strike over the past month.
Seeing that the download URLs and the C&C server URL are similar, it appears that most of
the attacks were by the same attacker. IOC of Cobalt Strike over the month is shown in the
list below.
AhnLab products are equipped with process memory-based detection method and behaviorbased detection feature that can counter the beacon backdoor which is used from the Cobalt
Strike’s initial invasion stage to spread internally.
