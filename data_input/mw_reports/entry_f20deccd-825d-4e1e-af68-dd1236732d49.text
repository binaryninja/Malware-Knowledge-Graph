Hacktivism: India vs. Pakistan
Posted by RFSID on February 11, 2016 in Cyber Threat
Intelligence

Floodlit international border between India and Pakistan, as seen from the International Space Station.

When India gained independence from Britain in 1947, a new, predominantly Muslim nation
of Pakistan was created during what was called the “partition.”
During this partition, about 15 million people were displaced and a million more died. The
“hastily drawn” border by the departing British, which separated Pakistan from the mostly
Hindu India, never fully resolved all the issues.
Several wars between the two nations ensued and tensions continue to this day. A ﬂoodlit,
1250-mile portion of the current international border (a.k.a. the Line of Control) is visible in a
photo taken from the International Space Station.

Indian soldiers (in present day Bangladesh) during the third war between India and Pakistan in December
1971.

The continuing rivalry between India and Pakistan has spilled over into cyberspace, very
visibly with hacktivism. This post reviews that activity and demonstrates how high-proﬁle
events and anniversaries (e.g., Indian Independence Day on August 15, Pakistan’s
Independence Day on August 14, the Mumbai attacks on November 26, and even cricket
matches between the two countries) often coincide with increased cyber activity.

The Cyber Dimension to India and Pakistan’s Cricket Rivalry

An India versus Pakistan cricket match, in March 14, results in an Indian university website being hacked.

The game of cricket provides a perfect ﬁeld for a great rivalry between India and Pakistan.
Wins and losses have geopolitical, social, and cyber repercussions on both sides.
Conversely, geopolitical and social tensions have led to matches being postponed or
cancelled.
On March 2, 2014, Pakistan defeated India in a cricket match in the Asia Cup held in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. The next day (March 3), in Meerut, India, 67 Kashmiri students at Swami
Vivekanand Subharti University were suspended for having cheered for Pakistan and
distributing sweets after their win.
Then on March 5, 2014, the website of Swami Vivekanand Subharti University was hacked
by a group claiming to be the Pakistan Cyber Army (a.k.a. Bangladesh Cyber Army) in
response to expelling pro-Pakistan students.
Finally, on March 7, 2014 the sedition charges against expelled students are dropped but
they could still face prosecution over the incident.
Based on this past event, it’s likely that cyber activity will take place between Indian and
Pakistani actors before, during, and after the next cricket match between India and Pakistan
on March 19 in Dharamsala, India.

A Predictable Pattern on Independence Days

India and Pakistan’s independence days, which fall on August 15 and August 14
respectively, create a predictable pattern (at least over the past three years) of attacks and
retaliatory strikes by the opposing hacker groups, as shown in the timeline below. An uptick
in such activity before and after this year’s independence days shouldn’t come as a surprise.

Pakistan Cyber Army Targeting India: A Snapshot 2007 Onward
Let’s take a closer look at the activities of the Pakistan Cyber Army (PCA), which was
involved in the cricket incident described earlier.
The timeline below shows that the PCA has been consistently active at least since the 2007
hacking, defacing and shutting down high-proﬁle Indian websites. Government and private
sites have been targeted including Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (a Fortune 500
company), Indian Railways, the Central Bureau of Investigation, Central Bank of India, and
the State Government of Kerala.

The PCA’s “public announcement” of its operations against India and the PCA’s motives are
described in a document on Pastebin as shown in the image below, conveniently cached in
Recorded Future. This particular message is related to PCA’s attacks to commemorate
Pakistan’s independence day (August 14).

When we investigate the PCA’s TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) to learn how
they operate, we ﬁnd examples like tutorials on how to set up phishing attacks as shown in
this Facebook post. Though of course it’s hard to establish, this is indeed a PCA actor who
posted this:

Below is another example where SQL injection attacks are allegedly used by Pakistani
hackers to compromise Indian websites.

In their research into PCA’s activities, ThreatConnect and FireEye also reported ﬁnding
possible links to personas with skills in exploiting Web applications and services, identifying
zero-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection, WEP cracking, and spear phishing.
In some instances the hackers chose to identify themselves — for example, the hacker
behind India’s Kerala state website defacement in September 2015 identiﬁed himself as
“Faisal 1337” as shown in the image below.

If we widen our view again and look at hackers from Pakistan and India targeting each other
over the last seven months, we can see an interesting retaliatory pattern of attacks; the
latest major response being Indian hackers avenging the deadly January 2, 2016 attack on
the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot.

There are a number of hacker groups in India including the Indian Black Hatswho reportedly
claimed responsibility for the January 7 (timeline image above) revenge for the attack on
Pathankot, and the Mallu Cyber Soldiers who were said to avenge the attacks on the Kerala
state government website.
When looking at hacking methods used by these groups, given that they go after weakly
secured websites or those with unpatched vulnerabilities, one can expect to ﬁnd generally
applicable instructions and techniques used and shared by various groups, especially when
they self-identify themselves under the broad umbrella of “India hackers.” The methods used
by these groups include SQL injection and PHP Web application hacks as shown by the
mentions below.

The Pastebin references mentions a tool “D3LT4” to scan websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and
further references to PHP scripts which can be used to hack Web applications.

Conclusion
The glimpses above hint at the many possible motivations and objectives of the cyber
activities between India and Pakistan.
These could range all the way from loosely afﬁliated hacktivist groups avenging attacks by
defacing symbols and institutions to more coordinated state-sponsored attacks, which will be
covered in a future piece. The Line of Control (a.k.a. international border) between the two
only serves as a symbol of adversarial tension and certainly not a barrier in the cyber realm.
