BlueSky Ransomware | AD Lateral Movement, Evasion
and Fast Encryption Put Threat on the Radar

August 25, 2022

BlueSky ransomware is an emerging threat that researchers have been paying increasing
attention to since its initial discovery in late June 2022. The ransomware has been observed
being spread via trojanized downloads from questionable websites as well as in phishing
emails.
Although infections at this time remain low, the ransomware‚Äôs characteristics, described
below, suggest it has been carefully developed for a sustained campaign. In this post, we
cover the latest intelligence on BlueSky ransomware to help security teams defend against
this developing threat.

Emergence of BlueSky Ransomware
BlueSky was first noted on VirusTotal by researcher @Kangxiaopao in late June 2022.
Subsequently, analysts from CloudSek and Unit42 have documented some of BlueSky‚Äôs
behavior.
At present, BlueSky has not stood up a public data leak site and BTC wallets associated with
known samples have not registered any transactions, indicating that the threat actor‚Äôs
distribution campaign is still in its infancy.
Initial delivery vectors seen to date include trojanized downloads from websites hosting
‚Äúcracks‚Äù and ‚Äúkeygens‚Äù as well as malicious attachments delivered via email. Some observed
mechanisms include delivery via third-party frameworks such as Cobalt Strike and BRc4.
Upon infection, BlueSky uses fast encryption techniques to rapidly process files on the target
and connected hosts. The ransomware has the ability to move laterally via SMB and has
been observed doing so in Active Directory environments. Encrypted files will be marked with
the .bluesky extension. Victims are instructed to contact the attackers via a TOR-based
portal to obtain a decrypter.

A multi-stage attack leading to a BlueSky infection was documented by Germ√°n Fern√°ndez
in early July.
Interesting, cracks/activators site distributes Powershell that installs #RemcosRAT (C2:
80.66.75.88:2807).
Depending on environment and privileges it also executes:
‚Äì JuicyPotato ‚Üì
‚Äì CVE-2022-21882 ‚Üì
‚Äì CVE-2020-0796 aka #SMBGhost ‚Üì
‚Äì #BlueSky Ransomware

Fern√°ndez tweeted details around an infection chain that, depending on the client,
resembles JuicyPotato, exploiting an elevation of privilege flaw (CVE-2022-21882) in
Microsoft Windows and a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2020-0796) in Microsoft
Server Message Block (SMB), before dropping the BlueSky ransomware.
The use of trojanized downloads was documented by CloudSEK. Trojanized downloads of
BlueSky ransomware were briefly made available via a website known to host questionable
executables such as application ‚Äúcracks‚Äù and ‚Äúkeygens‚Äù, license generators for software
products such as Windows 10.

Malicious Site Hosting BlueSky Payloads
One such site was observed being hosted at kmsauto[.]us . The following list of malicious
URLs were recorded as hosting BlueSky ransomware payloads. Note the redundant use of
both HTTP and HTTPS.
http[:]//kmsauto[.]us/alguien/l.exe
http[:]//kmsauto[.]us/alguien/potato.exe
http[:]//kmsauto[.]us/alguien/spooler.exe
http[:]//kmsauto[.]us/off/off.bin

BlueSky Ransomware Technical Details
The first stage of a BlueSky ransomware infection involves a compressed, base64-encoded
PowerShell script, start.ps1 . On execution, the script produces a further PowerShell
script, stage.ps1 . If stage.ps1 is run without administrator privileges, it first seeks to
elevate privileges through CVE-2021-1732 or CVE-2022-21882.

Once sufficient privileges are acquired, the script downloads the ransomware payload,
l.exe , and writes it to disk at the following file path:
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\javaw.exe.

The payload contains anti-analysis logic including leveraging NtSetInformationThread to hide
threads launched by the malware executable.

Setting ThreadInformationClass to the value of 0x11 prevents certain events from being
viewed or hooked by debuggers, or from being detected by certain EDR hooking
mechanisms. As noted by Unit32, BlueSky uses a multithreaded queue for faster encryption.
The ransomware makes use of the NtQueryInformationProcess API for process
discovery before calling TerminateProcess .

Local drives are discovered and stored via GetLogicalDriveStringsW , with the
ransomware traversing each drive serially.
BlueSky‚Äôs ability to spread laterally across accessible networks is enabled by way of SMB
(Server Message Block) and the NetShareEnum (+WNetOpenEnumW) API.

In some cases, 1000ms Sleep intervals are inserted between each remote connection
attempt.

Sleep MS count in hex
Previous researchers have noted that file targeting is inverted compared to typical
ransomware behavior: rather than targeting specific file extensions, BlueSky instead lists file
types to be excluded from encryption. The following extensions are reportedly excluded:
ldf, scr, icl, 386, cmd, ani, adv, theme, msi, rtp, diagcfg, msstyles, bin, hlp, shs,
drv, wpx, bat, rom, msc, lnk, cab, spl, ps1, msu, ics, key, msp, com, sys, diagpkg,
nls, diagcab, ico, lock, ocx, mpa, cur, cpl, mod, hta, exe, ini, icns, prf, dll,
bluesky, nomedia, idx

Post-Infection and Ransom Demands
The ransom note ‚Äú# DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.html ‚Äù is written into each folder
containing encrypted items. With the exception of the victim‚Äôs ‚Äòrecover ID‚Äô, all ransom notes
regardless of the target are identical. In addition, the malware drops notes in both text and
HTML format.

After infection, victims are instructed to visit the BlueSky ‚ÄòDECRYPTOR‚Äô portal and enter the
unique recovery ID embedded in the ransom note. The portal displays the time limit and the
increasing dollar amounts required to regain access to encrypted data.

BlueSky Decryptor Portal
In the pool of samples we analyzed, victims were given seven days to pay the ransom
demand, after which the ransom amount doubled.

Detecting and Protecting Against BlueSky Ransomware
As demonstrated in the following video, SentinelOne Singularity‚Ñ¢ fully protects against
BlueSky ransomware, preventing lateral movement across Active Directory and connected
devices.

Conclusion
BlueSky ransomware has the ability to rapidly encrypt the local host and move laterally by
exploiting known vulnerabilities. BlueSky campaigns appear to be in their infancy, but the
architecture of both droppers and payloads indicates that the actors have invested significant
effort and will be looking to reap the returns. Now is the time for security teams to get ahead
by bolstering their protection and detection posture.
