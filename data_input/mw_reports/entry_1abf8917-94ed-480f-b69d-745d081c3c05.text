Critical 0-day in Fancy Product Designer Under Active
Attack

June 1, 2021

Update: A patched version of Fancy Product Designer, 4.6.9, is now available as of June 2,
2021. This article has been updated to reflect newly available information, including
Indicators of Compromise.
On May 31, 2021, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team discovered a critical file upload
vulnerability being actively exploited in Fancy Product Designer, a WordPress plugin installed
on over 17,000 sites.
We initiated contact with the plugin’s developer the same day and received a response within
24 hours. We sent over the full disclosure the same day we received a response, on June 1,
2021. Due to this vulnerability being actively attacked, we are publicly disclosing with minimal
details until users have time to update to the patched version in order to alert the community
to take precautions to keep their sites protected.
While the Wordfence Firewall’s built-in file upload protection sufficiently blocks the majority of
attacks against this vulnerability, we determined that a bypass was possible in some
configurations. As such, we released a new firewall rule to our premium customers on May
31, 2021. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the rule after 30 days,
on June 30, 2021.

As this is a Critical 0-day under active attack and is exploitable in some configurations even if
the plugin has been deactivated, we urge anyone using this plugin to update to the latest
version available, 4.6.9, immediately.
Description: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and Remote Code Execution
Affected Plugin: Fancy Product Designer
Plugin Slug: fancy-product-designer
Affected Versions: < 4.6.9
CVE ID: CVE-2021-24370
CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Researcher/s: Charles Sweethill/Ram Gall
Fully Patched Version: 4.6.9
Fancy Product Designer is a WordPress plugin that offers the ability for customers to upload
images and PDF files to be added to products. Unfortunately, while the plugin had some
checks in place to prevent malicious files from being uploaded, these checks were
insufficient and could easily be bypassed, allowing attackers to upload executable PHP files
to any site with the plugin installed. This effectively made it possible for any attacker to
achieve Remote Code Execution on an impacted site, allowing full site takeover.
We will provide a more detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability once more users
have updated to a patched version.

How do I update?
In most cases you will need to login to codecanyon.net. Once you are logged in, you should
be able to visit the product page at https://codecanyon.net/item/fancy-product-designerwoocommercewordpress/6318393. In the Overview sidebar on the right-hand side of the
product page you should see a Download link:

Once you have downloaded the patched version of the plugin, you should be able to login to
your WordPress site and go to Plugins->Add New->Upload Plugin to upload the patched
plugin.

Indicators of Compromise
In most cases a successful attack results in a number of files which will appear in a subfolder
of either
wp-admin

or
wp-content/plugins/fancy-product-designer/inc

with the date the file was uploaded. For instance:
wp-content/plugins/fancy-productdesigner/inc/2021/05/30/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php

or
wp-admin/2021/05/31/4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php

Update – the filenames in question are deterministic and we have added filenames
associated with this vulnerability.
The following filenames and MD5 hashes are associated with this attack:
ass.php – MD5 3783701c82396cc96d842839a291e813 . This is the initial payload, a

dropper that then retrieves additional malware from a 3rd party site.
op.php – MD5 29da9e97d5efe5c9a8680c7066bb2840 . A password-protected Webshell.
prosettings.php – MD5 e6b9197ecdc61125a4e502a5af7cecae . A Webshell found in
older infections.
4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php – MD5
4329689c76ccddd1d2f4ee7fef3dab71 . This payload decodes and loads a separate
Webshell.
4fa00001c720b30002987d983e62d5e1.jpg – MD5
c8757b55fc7d456a7a1a1aa024398471 . The compressed webshell loaded by
4fa00001c720b30102987d980e62d5e4.php . Cannot be executed without the loader script.
The majority of attacks against this vulnerability are coming from the following IP addresses:
69.12.71.82
92.53.124.123
46.53.253.152

This attacker appears to be targeting e-commerce sites and attempting to extract order
information from site databases. As this order information contains personally identifiable
information from customers, site owners are in a particularly difficult position if they are still
running vulnerable versions of this plugin as it risks the e-commerce merchant’s PCI-DSS
compliance.

3/4

Our research indicates that this vulnerability is likely not being attacked on a large scale but
has been exploited since at least May 16, 2021. Update: Our Threat Intelligence Team has
now found evidence of this vulnerability being exploited as early as January 30, 2021.

Timeline
May 31, 2021 15:05 UTC – Wordfence Security Analyst Charles Sweethill finds evidence of
a previously unknown vulnerability during malware removal and forensic investigation as part

Conclusion
In today’s article, we covered a critical 0-day vulnerability in Fancy Product Designer that is
being actively attacked and used to upload malware onto sites that have the plugin installed.
While Wordfence Premium users should be protected against this vulnerability, we urge any
users of this plugin to update to the latest version of the plugin, 4.6.9, immediately, as it is
possible in some configurations to exploit the vulnerability even if the plugin is deactivated.
We will continue to monitor the situation and follow up as more information becomes
available.
Special Thanks to Wordfence Security Analyst Charles Sweethill for discovering the
vulnerability, determining the most likely vectors and indicators of compromise, and testing
the firewall rule during a holiday. We also wanted to extend kudos the the plugin developer,
radykal for quickly developing a patch for this issue.
