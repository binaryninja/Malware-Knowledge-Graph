INTRODUCTION
On September 25, 2015, President Barack Obama and Chinese
President Xi Jinping agreed that neither government would
“conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual
property” 1 for an economic advantage. Some observers hailed the
agreement as a game changer for U.S. and Chinese relations, while
skeptics saw this as little more than a diplomatic formality unlikely
to stymie years of state-sponsored intellectual property theft. 2 3
Since the agreement, there has been much discussion and
speculation as to what impact, if any, it would have on Chinese
cyber operations.
To investigate this question, FireEye iSIGHT
Intelligence reviewed the activity of 72 groups
that we suspect are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests. Going
back nearly three and a half years to early 2013,
our analysis paints a complex picture, leading
us to assess that a range of political, economic,
and other forces were contributing to a shift
in Chinese cyber operations more than a year
prior to the Xi-Obama agreement.

Between September 2015 and June 2016,
we observed 13 active China-based groups
conduct multiple instances of network compromise against corporations in the U.S., Europe,
and Japan. During this same timeframe, other
China-based groups targeted organizations in
Russia and the Asia Pacific region. However,
since mid-2014, we have observed an overall
decrease in successful network compromises
by China-based groups against organizations
in the U.S. and 25 other countries. These shifts
have coincided with ongoing political and
military reforms in China, widespread exposure
of Chinese cyber activity, and unprecedented
action by the U.S. Government.

KEY FINDINGS

13

Between late-2015 and mid-2016, 13 suspected China-based groups have compromised
corporate networks in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and targeted government, military,
and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.

25

Since mid-2014, we have seen a notable decline in China-based groups’ overall intrusion
activity against entities in the U.S. and 25 other countries. We suspect that this shift
in operations reflects the influence of ongoing military reforms, widespread exposure
of Chinese cyber operations, and actions taken by the U.S. government.

Since taking power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has implemented significant
military reforms intended to centralize China’s cyber elements and support a greater
use of network operations.

Public reports in recent years have exposed Chinese cyber operations and heightened
public awareness of China’s engagement in economic espionage. This likely provided
the U.S. government with political support to publicly confront China over the issue.

In 2014, the U.S. government began to take unprecedented measures in response to claims
of Beijing’s cyber-enabled economic espionage. Although many in the U.S. initially doubted
that these actions would have any effect, they may have prompted Beijing to reconsider
the execution of its network operations.

We have not seen evidence of a coordinated shift in the behavior of recently active
China-based groups—tactical changes appear to be specific to each group’s mission
and resources, and in response to public exposure of its cyber operations.

Under Xi’s leadership, the Chinese military began
to implement many long-discussed strategies
and concepts for conducting operations in cyberspace.
These reforms have sought to centralize and emphasize
military and government elements engaged in cyber
activity. Combined with Xi’s anti-corruption campaign
cracking down on the illegitimate use of state resources,
these reforms have begun materializing in what we
believe is a more refined approach to cyber operations.

CHINESE DOMESTIC REFORMS
China has undergone significant changes under Xi’s leadership, including
a massive centralization of presidential power, reforms restructuring the
country’s military capabilities, and growing regional security concerns. 4 Xi’s
unrivaled authority has allowed him to advance a large-scale reorganization
of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The reforms aim to improve China’s
ability to conduct joint operations and win “informationized” 5 wars, deemphasizing the army in favor of a stronger focus on cyber and maritime capabilities
and space assets.
Since 2012, Xi has also actively cracked down on government and military
elements using state resources for their own agendas. 6

CHINESE SECURITY CONCERNS
China is also facing pressing security concerns within the region, particularly
from Taiwan, Japan, and claimants in the South China Sea dispute. Taiwan’s
recent election of the pro-independence Democratic People’s Party has almost certainly prompted concern in Beijing. Despite the Taiwanese president’s
pledge to “maintain the status quo with China,” Beijing almost certainly views
the party’s pro-independence mindset as a threat to its territorial sovereignty
and future security. In addition, Japan’s increased willingness to defend its
regional interests, particularly through expanding the role of its Self-Defense
Forces, may allow Japan to balance China more effectively, curbing Beijing’s
influence and regional ambitions. Lastly, territorial disputes in the South China
Sea have intensified over the past few years, due in part to U.S. displays of
military power and China’s own island-building activities.
NOVEMBER 23, 2013
China establishes an air defense zone near disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands
in East China Sea.” 17
DECEMBER 17, 2013
Japan approves a new security strategy and increases defense spending.
China says that it is “closely watching Japan’s security strategy and policy
direction. Japan’s unreasonable criticism of China’s normal maritime
activities and its hyping up of the China threat has hidden political
motives.” 18
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei
MARCH 31, 2014
The Philippines asks the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration to determine
territorial sovereignty in the South China Sea19 “It is about defending what
is legitimately ours…it is about guaranteeing freedom of navigation for all
nations [and will help] preserve regional peace, security, and stability.” 20
Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario. The Philippines should
“stop going any further down the wrong track so as to avoid further
damage to bilateral relations.” 21
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei
AUGUST 5, 2014
During the ASEAN regional forum, the U.S. and the Philippines suggest a
“freeze” on island-building in the South China Sea, which China rejects. 22
SEPTEMBER 10, 2014
When describing its island building in the South China Sea “China’s activities
on relevant islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands fall entirely within China’s
sovereignty and are totally justifiable. [Construction is] mainly for the
purpose of improving the working and living conditions of people stationed
on these islands.” 23
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying
JANUARY 16, 2016
Taiwan elections bring the pro-independence Democratic People’s Party to
Power “We hope Tsai can lead the DPP out of the hallucinations of Taiwan

“There is only one China in the World, the mainland and Taiwan both belong

this basic fact and the consensus of the international community.” 25

As Beijing embarked upon sweeping changes impacting its
use of network operations, U.S. Government and defense
officials wrestled with how to effectively confront China
regarding its cyber espionage activity. 26 Although officials
had discussed China’s use of cyber espionage for years,
the issue was not widely recognized in the public sphere.
However, early 2013 saw multiple disclosures of breaches
targeting media outlets, the release of our APT1 report, and
additional reporting that attributed widespread corporate
intellectual property theft to military units within China’s
People’s Liberation Army (PLA). This exposure catapulted
the issue of Chinese cyber espionage into the public
consciousness, and likely provided the U.S. Government
with increased momentum with which to confront Beijing
- momentum that would quickly dissipate with Edward
Snowden’s disclosures of U.S. cyber activities.
In January 2013, the New York Times disclosed details
of a network compromise targeting its reporters that
was allegedly the work of the Chinese military. 27 Several
weeks later, we released our APT1 report, attributing years
of corporate intellectual property theft to Unit 61398 of

the PLA. APT1 and the many other exposure reports that
followed describe in detail the tools, tactics, and targets
of Chinese cyber operations, laying bare evidence to
support long-held suspicions of China’s large-scale cyber
espionage activity.
While the reports prompted outraged denials from the
Chinese government, U.S. Government officials described the
findings as “essentially correct” and “completely consistent
with the type of activity [the U.S. government has] been
seeing for some time.”28 29 The threat posed by China’s cyber
operations emerged as a prominent theme in countless
speeches, statements, and reports from U.S. leaders and
federal agencies. In May 2013, the Pentagon’s annual report
to Congress directly accused China of using its military to
conduct cyber operations against U.S. firms, and President
Obama prepared to raise the issue at the U.S.–China
Presidential Summit the following month.30 However, Edward
Snowden’s coinciding disclosures of U.S. cyber activities
diverted public attention to U.S. clandestine operations,
complicating any leverage that the U.S. might have had
to rebuke China over its economic espionage activities.31

“The report is “completely consistent
with the type of activity the Intelligence
Committee has been seeing for some time”

“The report’s findings are ‘essentially correct.’”

In 2014, the U.S. Government began taking punitive
measures against China, from indicting members of
the PLA to raising the possibility of sanctions. These
unprecedented measures, though met with skepticism
in the U.S., have probably been taken much more
seriously in Beijing.
In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted
five PLA officers, marking the first time that the U.S.
Government has charged foreign government personnel
with crimes related to commercial cyber espionage. 32 33
Although China warned that the move “jeopardizes ChinaU.S. cooperation,” the Department of Justice indicted
another Chinese national, Su Bin, the following August
for allegedly orchestrating a cyber-enabled economic

espionage operation targeting U.S. defense companies.34 35
In 2015, President Obama authorized the sanctioning of
individuals or entities involved in cyber activities that pose
“a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy,
or economic health or financial stability of the United
States.”36 Later that year, news reports emerged claiming
that the Obama administration had begun preparing a set
of unprecedented economic sanctions against Chinese
individuals and companies. 37

FROM SUSPECTED CHINA- BASED GROUPS

We examined the incidence of network compromises
by suspected China-based actors dating back nearly
three and a half years, to early 2013. Our data is based
on our visibility, which includes a combination of sources
(Mandiant Services engagements, FireEye as a Service,
and FireEye’s Dynamic Threat Intelligence data) that
provide us with both a breadth and depth of coverage.
While our visibility may vary from region to region
depending on our customer base, we believe it provides
a reasonable representation of Chinese cyber activity.
As shown in Active Network Compromises Conducted
by 72 Suspected China-Based Groups by Month
(in the following graph) a decline in activity began
in mid-2014. During that time period we identified 262
network compromises (where a network compromise
is defined as successful remote entry into a victim’s
network) conducted by 72 suspected China-based
groups. Our data analysis reveals an overall decline
in China-based intrusion activity against private
and public sector organizations since mid-2014.

Of the 262 compromises, 182 affected U.S. entities’

This includes one instance where a suspected Chinabased group stole information from a privately held
Chinese conglomerate. These compromises affected
a total of 25 other countries in Europe, Asia, South
America, the Middle East, and Africa. Following are

Although we have continued to see suspected Chinabased groups compromise corporations’ networks
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan and target entities
in the countries surrounding China through late
2015 and into 2016, our data shows an overall decline
in compromises that began in earnest in mid-2014 –
more than a year before the Xi-Obama agreement.
While there was a subsequent drop-off in activity
leading up to President Xi’s September 2015 visit to
the U.S., possibly orchestrated to avoid any negative
publicity during the meeting, it occurred during what
was already an ongoing decline in network intrusions.

T H E B A S I S FO R ‘ C H I N A - B A S E D ’
Attributing cyber activity to a geographic location is a
complex process. We are never fortunate enough to be
presented with a “smoking gun”; instead we rely on the
careful accumulation of multiple pieces of evidence in
sufficient quantity over time. Inevitably, as we discover
more about specific sets of activity, we frequently find links
that show us commonalities between these sets, and allow
us to assess that the same actors are behind two formerly
distinct groups.
Some of the factors we consider when assessing a group’s
location and potential sponsorship include, but are not
limited to, the following:
• Operations: The scope or scale of the group’s operations
and their level of sophistication (e.g., adaptability, stealth,
or access to advanced tools or exploits). What type of
group would have the resources (personnel, funding,
length of operations) to conduct this activity?
• Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): Does the
group use tools and methodologies that are generic, publicly available, or widely known, or ones that are unique,
novel, or not typically seen? Such TTPs may make a group
more or less distinctive, and potentially act as a “fingerprint” allowing us to link together disparate incidents.
• Operational Details: Groups operate with varying levels
of stealth and anonymity. At one end are actors who
make no attempt to hide their tools or operations, and
instead rely on victims’ inability to respond effectively for
their success. At the other end are actors who take great
pains to appear innocuous and limit or delete evidence of
their presence. However, even the most careful operators
make mistakes that can expose key details. Clues such
as language settings within malware, observed hours of
operation, build paths within binaries, or the use of infrastructure or services in particular geographic locations
may point to a particular locale. While such indicators
could be used deliberately for “false flag” purposes, human error often introduces anomalies that would expose
such an operation. When combined with other types of
evidence, these indicators can help support attribution.
• Motivation: We identify likely motivations based on the
individuals, organizations, or data the group targets, and
the themes present in any communications (spear-phishing messages, attachment contents, web sites leveraged
as part of an attack) with the targets.

Despite the decline, China-based threat groups continue to operate. Through late 2015 and 2016, we saw suspected
China-based groups compromise corporations’ networks in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, while also targeting
government, military, and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.

April – May 2016

Three groups compromised the networks of four firms headquartered in the
U.S., Europe, and Asia that are involved in the manufacturing of semiconductors
and chemical components used in the production of semiconductors. We did not
observe data theft in any of these instances. However, in 2012, we saw one of these
same groups compromise a semiconductor firm and target the workstation
of a key individual active in research and development. Other China-based
groups have also compromised and stolen data from semiconductor firms
in the past, including as recently as July 2015.

April – May 2016

After compromising a network, the group moved laterally, harvested credentials,
and deployed backdoors on systems at a U.S. high-tech corporation.

March – May 2016

In what appeared to be an attempt to obtain information related to U.S. military
projects, a group deployed backdoors to a victim’s web servers and harvested
credentials at a U.S. government services company.

August 2015 – March 2016

After compromising the network of a U.S. high-tech corporation, the group
began collecting data about navigational software in RAR files, likely in
preparation for transferring the data from the environment.

March 2016

A group compromised a U.S. healthcare organization and deployed
a backdoor providing continued access to the network.

December 2012-March 2016

In December 2012 a group breached the network of a U.S. software company.
In 2014, they returned to the network, packaged data on navigational projects
in likely preparation for removing it from the network. The same group returned
again in early 2016 and viewed files related to the same project, but they did not
transfer any data out of the network.

October 2015 – February 2016

In early 2016, a group prepared to transfer files out of the network
of a European consulting company. The files were related to technology
used in U.S. military projects.

January 2016

At a European logistics company a group collected user credentials during
an intrusion into the network.

October – November 2015

After a group breached the network of a major media company, they stole user
credentials, probably with the intent to expand their access within the network.

September – October 2015

At a U.S. aerospace company, a group deployed a backdoor, conducted network
reconnaissance, and harvested user credentials, likely in preparation for continued
activity. We did not observe the group transferring data from the network.

In addition to the confirmed network compromises
described above, our research identified suspected
China-based groups spear phishing governments and
commercial organizations headquartered in countries
surrounding China. Much of this activity appears to
be traditional espionage, primarily motivated by political
and security concerns amid ongoing diplomatic tensions
in the region.
We have strong indications that China-based groups have
been conducting espionage activity in the region for more
than a decade as shown, for example, by our profile of a
group likely backed by the Chinese government whom we
refer to as APT30. The Chinese Government’s use of cyber
operations to conduct espionage in support of state
security objectives parallels similar efforts by other nation

states to pursue state secrets through network means.
The targeting and data taken during traditional espionage
activity typically allows us to distinguish it from corporate
intellectual property theft. However, we frequently see
compromises where a group targets or steals data that
could equally serve military, security, and economic ends—
such as navigational technology. This gray area between
espionage that would support state economic ends and
that, which would support state security, makes it difficult
to definitively characterize espionage activity without
visibility into the data’s end use.
On the following map we identify several instances of 2015
and 2016 activity that indicate interest by China-based
groups in regional political and security targets.

RUSSIA
Mid to Late 2015
Spear phishing against
possible Russian defense
organizations and a Russian

THE MYTH OF
THE MONOLITH:
S O M E G R O U P S R E VA M P O P E R ATI O N S
W H I L E OT H E R S C A R RY O N
We have strong indications that the 72 groups we have
observed are based in China or otherwise support Chinese
interests, although we question whether there is much
consistency in the level of state direction or support that
each of these groups may receive from the Chinese Government. The Chinese landscape, frequently characterized
as monolithic and rigidly state-directed, is composed of a
wide range of groups, including government and military
actors, contractors, patriotic hackers, and even criminal elements. Occasionally, aligned interests between two types
of groups may drive activity that blurs the lines between
direct government sponsorship and independent action.
For example, during territorial disputes, patriotic hackers
may conduct targeting activity that is indistinguishable
from that of government forces. As a result, it is often
difficult to determine the extent to which activity is
directed by the Chinese Government.
The variety of changes (or lack of change) observed in
recent years across the groups we track demonstrates
the range of state direction and support that they most
likely receive. While this report discusses the likely impact
of political, economic, and other forces on Chinese cyber
activity as a whole, the extent to which specific groups
altered their activity in response to certain factors, such
as the Chinese Government’s efforts to restructure its
cyber forces, likely varies depending on how directly
the groups are aligned with the Chinese Government.

Despite an overall decline in China-based threat activity,
multiple groups actively conduct network intrusions, while
others continue to compromise servers to use as infrastructure in preparation for future network intrusion operations. We have noted some changes in tactics among
the groups that we track, but have not seen evidence of
coordinated, widespread shifts in how these groups operate. Changes in operations are more likely to be driven by
individual groups’ specific circumstances, resources, and
needs. For example:
• From mid-2014 through June 2016, a group did not
make any changes to the tools and infrastructure that
it used to compromise chemical companies in Germany,
Japan, and the U.S.
• From 2009 until 2014, a group relied heavily on the
same set of tools to compromise victims in multiple
industries. Then in late 2014, a report exposing one of
its most commonly used tools likely prompted the group
to develop and use replacements, including those that
incorporated anti-detection techniques. While the group
replaced many of its tools, the actors still use some of
those that had been exposed.
• A group that breached multiple victims in the U.S.
through 2014 appears to have discontinued operations
against organizations in the U.S., while continuing
to compromise U.S.-based servers, presumably for
use as infrastructure in carrying out other operations.
Between 2015 and March 2016, the group has compromised organizations in in Taiwan, India, and Japan.

CONCLUSION
In 2013, when we released the APT1 report exposing a PLA cyber espionage operation, it seemed like a quixotic effort
to impede a persistent, well-resourced military operation targeting global corporations. Three years later, we see a
threat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks.
Rather than viewing the Xi-Obama agreement as a watershed moment, we conclude that the agreement was one point
amongst dramatic changes that had been taking place for years. We attribute the changes we have observed among
China-based groups to factors including President Xi’s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of
Chinese cyber operations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.
Yet China is not the only actor in transition: we’ve observed multiple state-backed and other well-resourced groups
develop and hone their operations against corporate and government networks. The landscape we confront today
is far more complex and diverse, less dominated by Chinese activity, and increasingly populated by a range of other
criminal and state actors.
