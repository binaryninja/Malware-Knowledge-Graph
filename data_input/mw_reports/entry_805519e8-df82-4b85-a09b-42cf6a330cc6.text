Key Findings
Higher order infrastructure, utilizing IP addresses assigned to Palestinian providers,
identified for the Molerats APT group
Additional ‘attacker’ hosts identified (23.237.73[.]126 and 45.128.73[.]179), used to
target entities in Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Introduction
On 20 January 2022, Zscaler released a research blog detailing a Molerats espionage
campaign against targets in the Middle East, which had commenced in July 2021.
Molerats, often referred to as the ‘Gaza Cybergang’, are an Arabic-speaking, politicallymotivated threat group that has been operating since 2012. The group’s targets are primarily
located in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

Zscaler’s analysts had identified a screenshot from an attacker machine (see Figure 1
below), which they believed had been inadvertently uploaded whilst the actors were testing
malware. Within the screenshot an IP address, seemingly used to access the attacker
machine, was identified – 185.244.39[.]105.

In this blog we will explore activity surrounding 185.244.39[.]105 in further detail, using Team
Cymru’s Pure Signal™ Recon platform.
Network Telemetry
185.244.39[.]105

When examining network telemetry data for 185.244.39[.]105 over the past few months,
inbound connections to TCP/61003 were identified, with directionality inferred based on the
ephemeral ports used by the peer IP addresses.
In total, connections were observed from ten distinct IP addresses (see Table 1 below)
assigned to SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, PS, with traffic most recently observed on 06 January
2022. Geolocation data placed a number of these IP addresses in the Gaza Strip.

Table 1: IPs Connecting to 185.244.39[.]105:61003
As can be seen in Table 1, the relationship between the listed IPs and 185.244.39[.]105 is
sequential, with no cross-over in use observed in the first and last seen timestamps.
This activity is indicative of one user/machine being utilized to access
185.244.39[.]105 over an extended time period, with the client IP address refreshing
due to DCHP lease renewal; SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED is a home broadband provider
(wireless and ADSL).
Given this pattern of IPs assigned to the same provider (SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, PS) being
utilized to connect to an IP associated with the Molerats APT group, we decided to examine
network telemetry data, during the time periods specified, for each of the IPs listed in Table
1.
23.237.73[.]126

In each case, outbound sessions to remote UDP/46370 on 23.237.73[.]126 were observed
(see Figure 2 below for an example of this activity). This IP address is assigned to
FDCSERVERS, US – an American hosting/VPS provider.

Figure 2: An Illustration of Activity on 23.237.73.126:46370
Network telemetry data for 23.237.73[.]126 identified connections to remote TCP/443 on an
IP address assigned to a provider in Saudi Arabia. This activity occurred between 21 – 22
December 2021. Passive DNS data for this IP address identified it as a mail server for the
3/6

Secretariat General of a regional government organization in the Middle East.
When reviewing inbound network telemetry data for 23.237.73[.]126:46370, a further three
IP addresses were observed in UDP sessions:
85.114.96[.]246
85.114.102[.]90
85.114.112[.]152
All three IP addresses were assigned to FUSION-SERVICES, PS, with geolocation data
again placing them in the Gaza Strip.
As previously, a pivot was undertaken on these IP addresses in order to identify further
Molerats APT infrastructure.
45.128.73[.]179

Two of the IP addresses assigned to FUSION-SERVICES, PS were observed in outbound
sessions to remote UDP/47489 on 45.128.73[.]179. This IP address is assigned to
DEDIPATH, US – an American hosting/VPS provider.
In addition, five of the IP addresses contained in Table 1, as well as a further IP address
(45.130.98[.]149) assigned to SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, were observed in UDP sessions to
45.128.73[.]179:47489.
Furthermore, inbound connections to TCP/61637 on 45.128.73[.]179 were observed from
three of the IP addresses accessing 45.128.73[.]179:47489.
Network telemetry data for 45.128.73[.]179 identified connections to remote TCP/443 on an
IP address assigned to an Israeli provider. This activity occurred on 15 January 2022.
Passive DNS data for this IP address identified it as a web server for an Israeli government
department.
Summary

Figure 3 (below) provides a summary of all the network telemetry data discussed so far in
this blog, showing the links between the higher order infrastructure and ‘attacker’ hosts.

Figure 3: Molerats APT Infrastructure
Commonalities
Open ports information for the three IP addresses identified at the bottom of Figure 6 as
attacker infrastructure, showed that each host was running an Apache web server on
TCP/80; version 2.4.18 (Ubuntu). Open source information indicated that in each case, this
Apache version was first observed around June / July 2021. A variety of CVEs are reported
for Apache version 2.4.18, dating back to 2016. It is possible that Molerats APT actors
compromised these hosts for use in attack activity, although an alternative theory might be
that the actors are using an outdated version of Apache in the setup of their C2 servers.
Given the apparent vulnerability of these servers, it should be noted that other
malicious actors may have gained access during the period of activity examined in
this blog.
Conclusion
From the starting point of an IP address (185.244.39[.]105) associated with the management
of an ‘attacker machine’, it was possible to pivot and identify higher order infrastructure
utilizing IP addresses assigned to a Palestine provider. From this point a further pivot led us
to the identification of an additional ‘attacker’ host (23.237.73[.]126), based on observed
connections to the mail server of a Middle Eastern government organization during
December 2021.

5/6

Although it was possible to confirm successful connections were made to the mail server
(based on observed TCP flags), it is unclear whether the Molerats APT actors were able to
gain access to specific mailboxes (although this was the hypothesized intent).
Travelling back upstream from this new ‘attacker’ host, it was possible to identify further
higher order infrastructure, which led to another ‘attacker’ host (45.128.73[.]179) being
identified. In this case based on connections to an Israeli government web server during
January 2022.
Based on these observations, it is apparent that the infrastructure first identified by Zscaler
and expanded upon in this blog, is being utilized in current and ongoing operations
attributable to the Molerats APT group.
