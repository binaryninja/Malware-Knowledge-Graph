Named pipes are a method of inter-process communication in Windows. They’re used
primarily for local processes to communicate with eachother. They can also facilitate
communication between two processes on separate hosts. This traffic is encapsulated in the
Microsoft SMB Protocol. If you ever hear someone refer to a named pipe transport as an
SMB channel, this is why.
Cobalt Strike uses named pipes in several of its features. In this post, I’ll walk you through
where Cobalt Strike uses named pipes, what the default pipename is, and how to change it.
I’ll also share some tips to avoid named pipes in your Cobalt Strike attack chain too.

Where does Cobalt Strike use named pipes?
Cobalt Strike’s default Artifact Kit EXEs and DLLs use named pipes to launder shellcode in a
way that defeats antivirus binary emulation circa 2014. It’s still the default. When you see
\\.\pipe\MSSE-###-server that’s likely the default Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit binaries. You can
change this via the Artifact Kit. Look at src-common/bypass-pipe.c in the Artifact Kit to see
the implementation.
Cobalt Strike also uses named pipes for its payload staging in the jump psexec_psh module
for lateral movement. This pipename is \\.\pipe\status_##. You can change the pipe via
Malleable C2 (set pipename_stager).
Cobalt Strike uses named pipes in its SMB Beacon communication. The product has had this
feature since 2013. It’s pretty cool. You can change the pipename via your profile and when
you configure an SMB Beacon payload. I’m also aware of a few detections that target the
content of the SMB Beacon feature too. The SMB Beacon uses a [length][data] pattern and

these IOCs target predictable [length] values at the beginning of the traffic. The
smb_frame_header Malleable C2 option pushes back on this. The default pipe is \\
[target]\pipe\msagent_##.
Cobalt Strike uses named pipes for its SSH sessions to chain to a parent Beacon. The SSH
client in Cobalt Strike is essentially an SMB Beacon as far as Cobalt Strike is concerned. You
can change the pipename (as of 4.2) by setting ssh_pipename in your profile. The default
name of this pipe (CS 4.2 and later) is \\.\pipe\postex_ssh_####.
Cobalt Strike uses named pipes for most of its post-exploitation jobs. We use named pipes
for post-ex tools that inject into an explicit process (screenshot, keylog). Our fork&run tools
largely use named pipes to communicate results back to Beacon too. F-Secure’s Detecting
Cobalt Strike Default Modules via Named Pipe Analysis discusses this aspect of Cobalt
Strike’s named pipes. We introduced the ability to change these pipenames in Cobalt Strike
4.2. Set post-ex -> pipename in your Malleable C2 profile. The default name for these pipes
is \\.\pipe\postex_#### in Cobalt Strike 4.2 and later. Prior to 4.2, the default name was
random-ish.

Pipe Fitting with Cobalt Strike
With the above, you’re now armed with knowledge of where Cobalt Strike uses named pipes.
You’re also empowered to change their default names too. If you’re looking for a candidate
pipename, use ls \\.\pipe from Beacon to quickly see a list of named pipes on a lived-in
Windows system. This will give you plenty to choose from. Also, when you set your plausible
pipe names, be aware that each # character is replaced with a random character (0-9a-f) as
well. And, one last tip: you can specify a comma-separated list of candidate pipe names in
your ssh_pipename and post-ex -> pipename profile values. Cobalt Strike will pick from this
list, at random, when one of these values is needed.

Simplify your Offense Plumbing
Cobalt Strike uses named pipes in several parts of its offense chain. These are largely
optional though and you can avoid them with some care. For example, the default Artifact Kit
uses named pipes; but this is not a requirement of the Artifact Kit. Our other Artifact Kit
templates do not use named pipes. For lateral movement and peer-to-peer chaining of
Beacons, the TCP Beacon is an option. To avoid named pipes from our SSH sessions,
tunnel an external SSH client via a SOCKS proxy pivot. And, while a lot of our fork&run postexploitation DLLs use named pipes for results, Beacon Object Files are another way to build
and run post-exploitation tools on top of Beacon. The Beacon Object Files mechanism does
not use named pipes.

Closing Thoughts

2/3

This post focused on named pipe names, but the concepts here apply to the rest of Cobalt
Strike as well. In offense, knowing your IOCs and how to change or avoid them is key to
success. Our goal with Cobalt Strike isn’t amazing and ever-changing default pipe names or
IOCs. Our goal is flexibility. Our current and future work is to give you more control over your
attack chain over time. To know today’s options, read Kits, Profiles, and Scripts… Oh my!
This blog post summarizes ways to customize Cobalt Strike. Our late-2019 Red Team
Operations with Cobalt Strike mixes these ideas into each lecture as well.
