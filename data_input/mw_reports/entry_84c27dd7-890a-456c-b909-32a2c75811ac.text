06/08/2020
(Part 3 of 3) In this 3-part post, we share the tradecraft from an RDP brute force linked
ransomware event (MedusaLocker) we responded to in June 2020. We cover the business
ramifications of the attack, technical analysis and some advice based on attacks such as
these.
Continued from parts 1 and 2...

ATT&CK Map
We have mapped the TTPs of this adversary to the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a
heatmap of activity. We can see that this adversary used a limited, but powerful, selection of
TTPs.

Access PNG of image above.
Unfortunately, we’re seeing the same TTPs being used over and over again for ransomware
attacks, even if the initial access or lateral movement exploits vary.
We keep getting asked by customers to “tell us what we don’t know about our
vulnerabilities”. While the use of traditional defensive frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST or
PCI serve a compliance function, thinking like an attacker can rapidly highlight blind spots in
your environment.
Phishing attacks are a nuisance but largely a means to an end for adversaries and won’t put
you out of business on their own. A ransomware attack will lose reputation, money and
customers.
Never mind encrypting user workstations or file shares - destroying ERP and EDI systems
(as happened here) will leave an organisation completely unable to trade and haemorrhaging
money. That’s not counting the cost of restoring business systems, which is incredibly labourintensive, let alone the underlying IT infrastructure and the other parts of the Incident
Response process, or the intangibles like the reputational damage.

Without enough cash reserves or insurance coverage, there’s a real chance of even
medium-sized business ending up underwater depending on time-to-recovery and the bill at
the end. You might be tempted to just pay the ransom – but this isn’t a great option either as
there’s no guarantee you’ll get what you paid for. You still need to run through the IR
(Incident Response) process to find the intruders and kick them out of your network.
We should also pause and take note of the human cost of these operations – they are brutal.
The toll they take on those who suffer them is worse than intelligence motivated intrusions
where “damage” is a more abstract concept. There is often a massive time crunch to restore
systems at the expense of well-planned incident response process.

Strange Fruit
Several additional folders and files were deployed by the actor.
The following 4 deleted files were able to be recovered from the filesystem of the server with
timestamps and other metadata suggesting they are associated with the actor. The purpose
of these is not immediately clear and thus are not placed into this timeline.
