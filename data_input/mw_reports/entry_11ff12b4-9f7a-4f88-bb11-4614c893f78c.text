Introduction
Mobile threats have been around nearly as long as the mobile phone, but they continue to increase
in number and complexity as mobile devices become more embedded in, and critical to, our
everyday lives. What started out as a somewhat limited attack surface more than a decade ago
has grown into a vast landscape of devices utilizing the iOS and Android operating systems.
These devices include mobile phones, tablets, televisions, medical devices, alarm systems, and
point-of-sale credit card payment systems, among others.
Mobile platforms are primed for exploitation by governments engaged in espionage. They provide
a quick, all-in-one means to acquire sensitive data from precisely chosen targets. Mobile phones
today offer access to user location, contacts, email, texts and instant messaging, as well as
encrypted communication applications and business files. Mobile devices also often bridge the
gap between a target’s professional and personal lives.

Targeted mobile espionage campaigns
complement traditional computer network,
human, and signals intelligence efforts and
play to the advantage of governments stuck
in an asymmetrical power imbalance with
other nations. They also offer something
traditional espionage means do not: plausible
deniability and a lighter attack footprint.
Because of these advantages, the market for exploits targeting mobile devices has skyrocketed.
As of this publication, the going rate for a zero-click exploit for the Android operating system
has hit $2.5 million dollars, while zero-click iPhone exploits have dropped to $1 million dollars
(Greenberg, 2019). These nosebleed prices are reflective of the increasing difficulty of producing
reliable exploits given the significant financial and technological investments in security by
smartphone manufacturers over the past several years. Yet, difficult does not mean impossible.
Indeed, the sheer scale of mobile malware that is in-use by state or state-sponsored APT groups
that BlackBerry researchers observed in producing this report and the ease with which this mobile
malware has been interwoven with desktop malware campaigns, shows definitively that at least
several nation states have overcome that barrier.

Executive Summary
Mobile Malware and APT Espionage:
Prolific, Pervasive, and Cross-Platform
Until now, the public’s exposure to mobile phone malware has been dominated by news about
the privately run “greyware” vendors who have made headlines for being purveyors of spyware
tools. These commercial smartphone spyware tools reportedly end up in the hands of autocrats
who use it to hamper free speech, quash dissent, or worse. Consumers of these news stories are
often left with the impression that mobile malware is just something paranoid dictators purchase
for use within their own borders in remote third world nations. It is not.
In this report, BlackBerry researchers reveal what the focus on those groups has overshadowed:
several governments with well-established cyber capabilities have long ago adapted to and
exploited the mobile threat landscape for a decade or more. In this context, mobile malware is
not a new or niche effort, but a longstanding part of a cross-platform strategy integrated with
traditional desktop malware in diverse ways across the geopolitical sphere.
This approach has allowed state and state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups
to exploit a mobile dimension for espionage campaigns with impunity. Low threat detection
rates and a false sense of security have made mobile users an easy target. Given an immature
market, security solutions intended to block mobile malware are few in number, forensic access
to smartphones remains relatively limited, and existing public research into the mobile malware
threat posed by governments has been scattershot at best and maladroit at worst.
In the pages that follow, BlackBerry researchers expose several previously unknown attack
campaigns conducted by APTs both familiar and newly identified. The research will also
examine some already known, ongoing, targeted operations and reveal new intelligence and
connections that fill in existing gaps in previously published research. This report also represents
a broader survey of the strategic use of mobile malware by the Chinese, Iranians, Vietnamese,
North Koreans, and two other unknown but likely state-sponsored groups targeting Pakistan’s
government and military.
Through this research, the researchers seek to redefine the meaning of “state-sponsored APT” in
regard to threats targeting mobile devices and further define the notion of a Golden Age of APT
Mobile Malware that dawned long ago with little notice, yet through persistence and pervasiveness
continues to impact us all today.
This report provides a detailed survey of the strategic and tactical use of mobile malware by
various governments. It attempts to fill in gaps in earlier research on the subject of mobile
malware, and identifies and names new malware, new campaigns, and new threat actors — all of
which yields a new and redefined understanding of nation-state APT operations. The conclusions
drawn here are intelligence assessments representing judgments based on available data.

Key Findings
Strategic Intelligence Assessments:
• A collection of established state or state-sponsored APT groups acting in the interests of
the Chinese, Vietnamese, North Korean, and Iranian governments have demonstrated the
capability to develop native Android and/or iOS mobile malware. The malware is employed
in both stand-alone campaigns targeting mobile devices as well as incorporated into crossplatform mobile/desktop espionage campaigns. This activity has been ongoing for a decade
or more but has only recently garnered attention.
• Many of the government mobile espionage efforts examined had roots in campaigns
designed to spy on targets of interest of some of the nations covered in this report for
political purposes. Yet, we have also observed these APT groups pivot to traditional foreign
intelligence and/or economic espionage targets. This suggests a more mature, un-siloed
and collaborative effort inside different government entities where tools, infrastructure, and
intelligence are being shared.
• The ability of state and state-sponsored APT groups to develop and deploy mobile
surveillance campaigns within their existing cyber espionage efforts has outpaced the
security industry’s ability to detect and deter this malware on the endpoints.

Tactical Intelligence Assessments:
• A recent mobile espionage campaign against targets of interest can be traced back to the
Chinese state-sponsored APT group known under the umbrella term WINNTI, known for
desktop malware campaigns targeting global gaming companies, pharmaceutical giants,
industrial manufacturing, chemical companies, and the United States defense industrial base.
• The earliest documented mobile campaign against targets of interest is connected to desktop
espionage campaigns by a Chinese state or state-sponsored APT BlackBerry researchers
refer to as BBCY-TA1 (a.k.a. IRON HUSKY). This group’s targets also include the Russian
military and ongoing surveillance of the Mongolian government.
• Another early mobile campaign against targets of interest can be attributed to the Chinese
state or state-sponsored APT known as REAVER (a.k.a. SUTR), whose previously observed
campaigns involve desktop malware and a range of Western economic and government
espionage targets. Several other well-known Chinese APT groups, including LOTUS BLOSSOM
and SCARLET MIMIC, are also linked to this activity.
• Targets of interest are the focus of a cross-platform (mobile and desktop malware)
espionage campaign utilizing newly identified malware families for Android and Windows
that BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID3 and PWNWIN1. This is the work of a
newly identified Chinese state or state-sponsored APT group BlackBerry researchers have
dubbed BBCY-TA2 conducting a newly identified campaign BlackBerry researchers dubbed
OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX. The group shares infrastructure with another newly identified
Chinese state or state-sponsored APT group BlackBerry researchers have dubbed BBCY-TA3
which is engaged in economic espionage and whose targets include a range of Western and
South Asian commercial enterprises in telecommunications and chemical manufacturing
in nearly every major chemical manufacturing company in the world outside China, with
particular interest in companies based in Germany, the U.S., and Canada.

• In fewer than three years, the Iranian effort to add mobile surveillance capabilities underwent
drastic improvement in terms of the quality and complexity of its Android malware, the
sophistication of its socially engineered delivery mechanisms, the ability to pivot between
domestic and foreign target sets, and the implantation of a cross-platform strategy that
integrates mobile and desktop malware.
• North Korea (DPRK) has at least two APT groups, LAZARUS and SCARCRUFT, engaged in
espionage campaigns with a mobile dimension. In one campaign, it appears that SCARCRUFT
inexplicably engaged in false-flag activity designed to implicate LAZARUS.
• Vietnam’s OCEANLOTUS (a.k.a. APT32) has been conducting isolated mobile operations
since at least early 2014, predating the identification and examination of the group.
• A newly identified OCEANLOTUS espionage campaign BlackBerry researchers have dubbed
OPERATION OCEANMOBILE has both a mobile and a desktop dimension. The newly
identified mobile malware family, which BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNDROID1,
is obfuscated to escape detection and is propagated via fake apps made available on
legitimate app stores by way of elaborately concocted cover stories as well as through
well-known third-party app stores.
• The Pakistani government is the target of a newly identified and ongoing espionage campaign
BlackBerry researchers have dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK which is employing newly
identified malware BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNDROID2. BlackBerry researchers
determined the campaign to be the work of a likely state-sponsored APT group known as
BITTER. The malware was propagated via fake apps and elaborate phishing schemes that
mimic real entities including Pornhub Premium and the Ansar Foundation.
• The Pakistani military, other government agencies and their officials were also the subject
of a concurrent espionage campaign employing both mobile and desktop components
BlackBerry researchers have dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK2 which utilizes newly identified
Windows malware family BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNWIN2. BlackBerry
researchers determined this effort to be the work of another state-sponsored APT group
known as CONFUCIUS.

China
The earliest publicly available security research detailing the use of mobile malware by a nationstate APT focused on China. The most frequent focus of Chinese mobile malware are targets of
interest perceived to be a potential threat to the power of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Analysts point out that, in attempts to influence how China is perceived both at home and abroad
and solidify The Party’s authority, the CCP has for many years prioritized efforts to “win over” (or
undermine) groups critical of official national narratives put forward by Beijing. That imperative
brought about something of a “whole of government” response involving different agencies, each
of which is tasked with distinct but overlapping missions which eventually dovetail on similar
policy issues. These efforts come from different angles, but all feature some form of domestic
espionage (Bowe, 2018).
Chinese state-run organizations dedicated to this effort include the overt and purportedly civilian
United Front Work Department, the Ministry of State Security (an intelligence agency) that runs
covert operations both at home and abroad, and a section of the Chinese military engaged in
both overt and covert warfare that until recently was known as the Liaison Department of the
PLA’s General Political Department. After a 2016 reorganization of the Chinese military, it is now
likely called the Central Military Commission’s Political Work Department (Bowe, 2018).

The Political Work Department and
its predecessor have a long and
fascinating history dating back to the
1930s and the start of World War II.
Analysts have noted that much of its work was borrowed or heavily influenced by the former
Soviet Union’s “active measures” playbook. This branch of the Chinese military is understood to
engage in work that “operates at the nexus of politics, finance, military operations, and intelligence
to amplify or attenuate the political effect of the military instrument of national power,” (Stokes
& Hsiao, 2013).

CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:
EXAMPLE 1 — RECENT TARGETING OF POLITICAL TARGETS BY WINNTI
The mobile malware campaign efforts BlackBerry researchers observed against Chinese targets
of interest can be understood as a single covert stage in a larger active measures influence
operation and strategy. The question becomes: who was and is currently behind these attacks?
Might the Political Work Department have a cyber capability and field activity groups?
BlackBerry researchers examined the most recent mobile malware case to come to public
attention: campaigns against targets of interest in diaspora via iOS and Android malware as
described by Volexity (Case, Meltzer, & Adair, 2019) and Google’s Project Zero (Beer, 2019). Google
did not specifically mention who was targeted, but they detailed the iOS exploits and implants
employed in great depth. In this campaign, mobile malware was distributed via a number of
popular websites of interest to or only accessible to the targets of interest and their supporters
outside of China.
BlackBerry researchers found, after investigating these two reports, that the attack group behind
the campaign was likely not a previously unknown Chinese APT group — one who might represent
the hidden cyber wing of the Political Work Department. Instead we found these recent espionage
attacks to be linked to a very familiar Chinese APT group known as WINNTI, particularly as
described in its later iteration as BURNING UMBRELLA (Hegel, 2018).
WINNTI has been categorized within the security community as something of a conglomerate
utility player working in support of the Chinese government with various, disparate targets
in desktop malware campaigns, including global gaming companies, pharmaceutical giants,
industrial manufacturing, chemical companies, and the United States defense industrial base.

While WINNTI has been known to target
multiple desktop platforms, including Linux,
BlackBerry research reveals for the first
time here that WINNTI also engages in
mobile espionage campaigns. Here’s a brief
description of how the connection was made:
• The IP address “142.4.50[.]213” mentioned in the Volexity report had “d.scanvpn[.]com”
resolve to it beginning in November of 2014. We found an additional subdomain “mail.
scanvpn[.]com” which resolved to “133.130.89[.]39” in October of 2018. The domain “mail.
openmd5[.]com” also resolved to this IP address beginning in June of 2018. The “openmd5[.]
com” domain was first registered with the email address “rooterit@outlook[.]com”. This email
address was used to register the following domains:
• aboluewang[.]com

classifyonline[.]com

freesss[.]net

• “rooter[.]tk” and was previously documented by several different organizations.
• ThreatConnect observed the domains used to directly target and infect targets of interest in
2013 as well as being used in the strategic compromise of the legitimate websites to deliver
malware (ThreatConnect Research Team, 2013).
• Palo Alto’s Unit42 noticed the domains were used as command-and-control servers for
several “FFRAT” samples in 2015 (Flacone, Scott, & Cortes, 2015).
• Citizen Lab found the same domains were linked to an operation used to target several
Chinese language news sites in 2017 (Dalek, Alexander, & Brooks, 2017).
• “rooterit@outlook.com” more recently appeared in a larger report titled BURNING UMBRELLA
(Hegel, 2018) providing a direct link to the WINNTI umbrella.

As demonstrated above, many different security companies had a snapshot in time of one small
piece of the WINNTI elephant, but none possessed a complete picture. Given this APT’s consistent
focus on targets of interest, it should come as no surprise that this group is also continuing to
pursue China’s interests in monitoring targets of interest living abroad.
The most recent effort compliments a domestic campaign that also features a mobile dimension.
For several years, the Chinese government has compelled those entering the Xinjiang region in
China to install Android applications on their smartphones (AFP, 2017), some of which have been
found to have atrociously bad security (Cox, 2018), raising suspicions that they are really meant
as backdoors focused on certain targets of interest.
The connection between the political espionage campaign and a threat actor best known for
military and economic espionage on other platforms was surprising. Analysts have written
about the crossover between China’s active measures effort and its wider intelligence apparatus
since before APT1 was named and shamed. In 2013, Mark Stokes and Russell Hsiao wrote
about the converging interests of the then PLA’s General Political Department or GPD (now the
CMC’s Political Work Department) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS). “Given common roots
tracing back to the 1930s,” they wrote, “GPD liaison work and MSS operations may sometimes
be indistinguishable,” (Stokes & Hsiao, 2013).
Indeed, Stokes and Hsiao suggest that China’s political warfare unit was (and is) likely also a
consumer of intelligence from other units of the Chinese military, including signals and foreign
intelligence. The crossover is understandable, as certain targets of interest are not just the focus
of the government for domestic issues, but also for alleged counterterrorism reasons. China
considers elements of some targets of interest an extremist threat to its government both at
home and abroad.

CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:
EXAMPLE 2 — BBCY-TA1
BlackBerry researchers found that the domestic/foreign intelligence crossover is not limited to
the one example presented above.

The connections between China’s mobile
attack campaigns aimed at specific
targets of interest and traditional desktop
campaigns aimed elsewhere go back
to the earliest public security research
detailing China’s mobile surveillance.
One report, published by Kaspersky Lab in March of 2013, was the first to document Android
attacks against targets of interest. The attacks followed the compromise of an email account
belonging to a high-profile target of interest. This email account was subsequently used to send
spear-phishing emails to the target’s contacts. One of the payloads sent in these emails was
written for Android, and the subject of the email itself purported to be related to a high profile
target of interest group (Baumartner, Raiu, & Maslennikov, 2013).
The Android malware did not automatically send harvested information from infected phones,
but instead waited until a specially crafted text message was received. Another piece of Android
malware (known as an APK file), also identified by Kaspersky, referenced the disputed Senkaku
Islands/ Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which continue to be a geopolitical flashpoint
between China and Japan to this day.
In revisiting Kaspersky’s early work, BlackBerry researchers were able to connect those earliest
attacks to a threat group active today in targeted desktop attacks aimed at the Mongolian
government. BlackBerry researchers refer to this group as BBCY-TA1. Kaspersky was the first
to identify this group (which they called IRON HUSKY) a few years ago and documented prior
desktop campaigns targeting the Mongolian government as well as the Russian government and
military, but they appear not to have made the connection to the early mobile campaign against
targets of interest, and indeed have only published limited information on IRON HUSKY since.
Here is how BlackBerry researchers identified this new connection:
• Both of the Android backdoors mentioned in the 2013 Kaspersky report communicated with
the IP address “64.78.161[.]133,” which was subsequently used by another malicious domain
“www.mol-government[.]com” in July of 2014.
• This domain was linked to multiple China-affiliated attacks on the Mongolian government
and the email address “hlemonk@163[.]com” (Fagerland, 2012).
• One of the domains associated with that email address has remained operationalized
to this day and continues to be used in isolated, targeted attacks against the Mongolian
government by BBCY-TA1.

What’s notable about this connection is that it suggests either that two Chinese APT groups with
different targets and different missions are sharing infrastructure, or that a single APT group has
expanded its targeting portfolio well beyond its initial scope. Both possibilities have implications
which are addressed below.

A COMBINED THREAT: EXAMPLE 3 — REAVER
In the month following the Kaspersky research on the mobile malware campaign, in April of 2013,
Citizen Lab published research that showed a different mobile campaign had been deployed
nearly five months prior, in December of 2012, focusing on targets of interest with trojanized
Android applications. In this case, the attacker’s use of command-and-control infrastructure
was considerably more complex and used encoded web comments to issue commands to the
infected devices.
After further investigating the Citizen Lab report, BlackBerry researchers connected the 2012
mobile attacks on activists to several well-known, traditional desktop APT espionage groups
including REAVER (aka SUTR), SCARLET MIMIC, and LOTUSBLOSSOM, whose tools notably do
not typically include mobile malware. Instead, REAVER and LOTUSBLOSSOM are better known
for Windows-based espionage campaigns linked to recent attacks on the automotive industry,
the defense industry, the European Union, and the United Nations.
BlackBerry researchers previously wrote about similar crossover with targets of interest
(BlackBerry Cylance Threat Intelligence Team, 2019). BlackBerry researchers made the new
connection as follows:
• The domain “android.uyghur.dnsd[.]me” first resolved to the IP address “184.82.123[.]143”
nearly seven months prior in May of 2012 and changed to IP address “216.176.190[.]44” in
September of 2012, which would strongly indicate that it was likely used before December.
• The domain “internet.3-a[.]net” also resolved to both IP addresses around the same timeframe
and was later directly attributed to SUTR by Citizen Lab. In the same vein another dynamic
DNS domain was also connected to this one “ios.dnsd[.]info” which would indicate that iOS
devices were likely targeted around the same timeframe.
• Several other dynamic DNS domains linked to this early attack continued to resolve into
the present and connect to REAVER/SUTR, SCARLET MIMIC, and even LOTUSBLOSSOM.
This would again indicate either shared infrastructure among different APT groups with vastly
different targeting priorities, which in the BlackBerry researcher’s estimation is rare, or a single
APT group with a wildly disparate target set over time, which would also be anomalous. Both
possibilities present significant challenges to the conventional wisdom surrounding Chinese
APT groups.

CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:
EXAMPLE 4 — BBCY-TA2 AND BBCY-TA3
In retracing the history of the first publicly available reports on Chinese mobile malware
campaigns, BlackBerry researchers found one campaign could be traced from the earliest
reported activity straight through to the present day. It should come as no surprise that it was
aimed at other political targets of interest making headlines. BlackBerry researchers observed
a resurgence in the group’s activity whenever domestic unrest began to arise in specific regions
of the country.
BlackBerry researchers dubbed this newly identified campaign OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX.
The researchers also identified new malware families that target both Android and Windows,
which BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID3 and PWNWIN1, respectively. The effort is
the work of a newly identified Chinese APT group BlackBerry researchers dubbed BBCY-TA2.
BBCY-TA2’s malware is distributed via mobile applications that mimic a popular peer-to-peer
marketplace called “localbitcoins[.]com” designed to convert Bitcoin to cash at the regional level.
China has seen a sharp rise in cryptocurrency adoption and demand following the ongoing unrest
because certain targets of interest rely on Bitcoin for operational security and concerns over local
currency instability. Numerous local retailers have begun to accept various cryptocurrencies while
Bitcoin Cash is becoming a near de-facto standard among certain Chinese targets of interest
(Redman, 2019), (Hamacher, 2019). But to be truly useful, crypto cash must often become hard
cash in the local currency. And that is what sites like Local Bitcoins offer.
BBCY-TA2 has taken note and taken advantage. PWNDROID3 offered a wide range of capabilities
including geolocation tracking, call monitoring, screen monitoring, and a host of other functions.
Perhaps the most intriguing feature was a function that holds a list of specific locations or
addresses and sends BBCY-TA2 geofencing alerts when they are visited. Here is a brief overview
of the technical connections between BBCY-TA2 and the 2014 campaigns, as well as a quick
tour of OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX:
• The 2014 mobile campaigns, which came in September of that year, involved the “Occupy
Central with Love and Peace” movement. Reporting at the time was often conflicting; however,
given access to better data sources now, the majority of these mobile campaigns were all
closely related and most likely deployed by the same set of operators, BBCY-TA2.
• The first campaign mimicked Code4HK, a group of developers. A message, “Check out
this Android app designed by Code4HK for the coordination of Occupy Central!” was sent
to a number of targets of interest and contained a trojan which communicated back to the
domains “www.xsser[.]com” and “mm.v1lady[.]com” (Boehler & Sam, 2014). The Code4HK
malware was also signed with the email address “STREAM@V1LADY[.]COM” on July 7, 2014.
• Shortly thereafter Lacoon Mobile Security (now Check Point) discovered what they called
Xsser iOS mRAT (Bublil, Brodie, & Bashan, 2014). mRAT also communicated to “www.xsser[.]
com” and was one of the first targeted iOS threats to be found in the wild. However, it would
have only been able to infect already jailbroken devices. Conveniently, according to research
at the time, roughly 14% of the nearly 60 million iOS devices in China had been jailbroken to
support Chinese keyboard applications.
• The domain “mm.v1lady[.]com” resolved to “112.124.47[.]157” beginning on September
17, 2014. This IP would be a lynchpin for the group for nearly three years and link to both
“mm.bbmouseme[.]com” and “mm.outputinfo[.]com”. Lookout found the same operators
had created a new Android RAT they termed xRAT in 2017 (Flossman, 2017), and newer
undisclosed variants continue to infect users even in 2019.

Regarding OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX:
• “63c9a6108c056cfd3962c2608d262384d65ac199d5ec480f6e8779e470915df8” is one
recent sample signed on July 11, 2018 which communicates to BBCY-TA2’s C2, “huaian.
bbmouseme[.]com”, and portends to be related to “localbitcoins[.]com”.
• The sample utilized the “javax.crypto.Cipher” DES implementation to encode sensitive strings
in the APK with the secret key “i_want_you_and_i_need_you”. This key appears in some of
BBCY-TA2’s Windows backdoors as well. The author(s) may not have fully understood the
mobile implementation, though, as only the first 8-bytes of the previous string would be used
in the encryption and decryption process.

OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX marks the fourth
example BlackBerry researchers identified in this
report where there was established crossover in
infrastructure with another APT group’s activity.
In this case BBCY-TA2’s infrastructure crosses into the activity of another desktop-malwarefocused APT group, though it too appears to be new. BlackBerry researchers have dubbed this
newly identified yet traditional cyber espionage APT group BBCY-TA3.
BlackBerry researchers observed this group most recently targeting telecommunications providers
across the countries that ring the South China Sea for espionage purposes. In addition, BlackBerry
researchers observed extensive campaigns throughout 2018 and 2019 in which BBCY-TA3
pursued nearly every major chemical manufacturing company in the world outside China, with
particular interest in companies based in Germany, the U.S., and Canada.

Conclusions on Chinese Activity
After an historic retrospective look at China’s mobile surveillance, it is clear the majority of it
was consistently domestic in focus. During this introspection BlackBerry researchers uncovered
unexpected connections to a range of additional APT groups whose targets run the gamut of
verticals from government to military to commercial, and which crisscross the globe.
These connections are significant because they challenge an assessment some China analysts
have made about the government’s ability to integrate horizontally and coordinate across a vast
bureaucracy rife with its own problems of dysfunction, corruption and stove-piping, as represented
in the seminal Chinese Industrial Espionage (Hannas, Mulvenon, & Puglisi, 2013).
If Chinese APT groups are coordinating efforts and/or sharing tools, they become more difficult
to defend against. The shared tool sets also pose a challenge for organizations whose risk
profile relies on blacklisting domains or looking only for certain types malware, and who might
mistakenly allow access on the basis of the belief that they are outside of China’s target profile.
Our perception of the Chinese APT groups must expand to include both mobile and desktop
threats, domestic and foreign organizations, and domestic/economic/government/military target
profiles. It’s also worth expanding our notion of the typical target of the Chinese government:
malware meant for targets of interest in diaspora for domestic reasons may very well end up
inside a Western business that proves an attractive target for someone else.

Iran
Iran’s mobile surveillance capability has historically been primarily focused inward to target
various people of interest to the Iranian government. While some of the first documented cases
involved journalists and activists abroad, the motivation behind the attacks appeared to be
domestically driven.

The Iranian APT strategy for adoption of the
mobile dimension is thus in line with that of
the Chinese attack groups, whose earliest
mobile campaigns were similarly motivated
by an imperative to keep track of certain
individuals both in and out of country who
challenged the authority of the government.
DOMESTIC KITTENS?
Public research on Iranian mobile attacks was first published in 2016 and revealed a statesponsored effort still in the initial stages of development, where threat actors deployed a relatively
immature and simplistic toolset which included variants of “DroidJack” and Android Metasploit
payloads (Guarnieri & Anderson, 2016). Following this early activity, it was clear the Iranian
government took on significant development efforts, as revealed in the exposure of several
subsequent and more sophisticated mobile campaigns such as Check Point’s DOMESTIC KITTEN
report last year (Check Point Research, 2018).
In their report, Check Point detailed how a more advanced set of Android malware was quickly
leveraged in a prolonged campaign of Iranian government espionage that was focused on Kurdish
and Turkish natives, as well as ISIS supporters. At first glance this would suggest an outwardfacing mobile espionage effort driven by counterterrorist and foreign policy concerns. None of
that would be particularly surprising given that all these groups are in play in the Syrian conflict
where Iran supports the Assad regime.
However, Check Point assessed that the targets were in fact all Iranian citizens. What we still do
not know, based on Check Point’s analysis, is whether this domestic campaign was motivated
by a larger, politically driven influence operation strategy as with the Chinese, or if it represents
one facet of a larger political security strategy, or both. In a follow up post, Check Point added

MALWARE

&

APT

ESPIONAGE

more insight and clarified that “despite the heavy targeting of Iranians, there were also Kurdish
and Urdu natives, ISIS supporters and even Yemeni citizens among the victims,” (Check Point
Research, 2018).
While only a limited number of indicators of compromise (IoCs) were shared in Check Point’s
initial report, BlackBerry researchers used the IoCs provided to find a much larger list of hashes
as well as command-and-control infrastructure detailed in the Appendix. BlackBerry researchers
expanded on the intelligence for the public to better understand and assess this threat.
In Check Point’s follow-up post published a month later and referred to above, a number of
additional details were released regarding DOMESTIC KITTEN, including the name of one of
the more complex Android samples BlackBerry researchers observed: “com.eracomteck/
example.badoo”.
This Android malware is relatively unique, and BlackBerry researchers used it along with other
forensic indicators to draw a clear connection to a different campaign written about in a June
2019 report by TrendMicro called “Bouncing Golf” (Xu & Guo, 2019). TrendMicro noticed the
connection to DOMESTIC KITTEN but did not adhere to it conclusively. In our view, “Bouncing
Golf” was very clearly a continuation of DOMESTIC KITTEN’s activities.
What’s significant about that connection is that it represents a dramatic shift in targeting from
domestic to foreign espionage. The majority of the data TrendMicro was able to identify in the
most recent campaigns was related to stolen military documents and images, all taken primarily
from other Middle Eastern countries. This is also indicative of a concurrent shift in motivation
behind the espionage, from domestic to military.
In a relatively short amount of time, Iran can be seen to have followed an implementation strategy
first employed by other non-democratic countries like China in honing a capability initially on
domestic targets of interest before turning it outward for other espionage purposes. Iran has
previously been observed following this course in the development and implementation of its
traditional desktop cyber operations strategy (Anderson & Sadjadpour, 2018).

MUDDYWATER GOES MOBILE
BlackBerry researchers uncovered how DOMESTIC KITTEN, an Iranian APT group that uses
mobile malware, has expanded its portfolio from domestic target to include foreign espionage
targets in a short amount of time. Let’s consider another example, this time with another Iranian
APT group that has been traditionally focused on foreign espionage using desktop malware, but
which has recently been observed adding a mobile component to its campaigns — MUDDYWATER.
In June of 2019, TrendMicro pointed out that the MUDDYWATER group had started deploying
Android payloads. In their report, TrendMicro explained how a number of pieces of Android
malware reached their targets, detailing an SMS phishing campaign that sent messages in
Turkish with a link which, if clicked, took victims to a website which they identified as a “legitimate
website belonging to a non-profit research organization in Turkey.” They wrote, “most likely, the
organization’s website was compromised, which is not surprising as its website was hosted on
WordPress, a platform MuddyWater is fond of targeting,” (Lunghi & Horejsi, New MuddyWater
Activities Uncovered, 2019).
Here is a technical explanation of how TrendMicro made that connection:
• TrendMicro was able to identify four unique android payloads based upon a common
command and control server “78.128.139[.]131”. The following Six unique Android APK’s
were available in a common malware repository:
02f54da6c6f2f87ff7b713d46e058dedac1cedabd693643bb7f6dfe994b2105d

dff2e39b2e008ea89a3d6b36dcd9b8c927fb501d60c1ad5a52ed1ffe225da2e2
• One variant, e9617764411603ddd4e7f39603a4bdaf602e20126608b3717b1f6fcae60981f2,
was slightly different from the six above but still contained a reference to a unique image
hosted at the URL:
“http://airplanesandmore[.]com/prodimages/largeSpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour.jpg”.
• The SMS spreading function also still linked to a malicious APK hosted from the URL:
“http://setav[.]org/wp-includes/APK/SetaNews.apk”, which served the SHA256 hash
be9fb556a3c7aef0329e768d7f903e7dd42a821abc663e11fb637ce33b007087.
Indeed, the website in question, “setav[.]org, is the website for SETA, which in English is The
Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, a political policy think tank based in
Ankara, Turkey. TrendMicro did not discuss that although the think tank describes itself as
“independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan,” a German news organization uncovered evidence
that it is more than that.
Deutsche Welle, a German broadcast media company published a news item claiming that “the
foundation is run by [Turkish Prime Minister] Erdogan loyalists and headed by Serhat Albayrak,
the elder brother of Erdogan’s son-in-law, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak. He is also Chairman of
the Board of the largest government-related media group in Turkey. Virtually all of SETA’s senior
management is active in an advisory capacity for Erdogan,” (Mumay, 2019).

Deutsche Welle also provided evidence that the supposed non-profit was used in information and
influence operations beneficial to the Turkish government. BlackBerry researchers assess that
MUDDYWATER was aware of this connection, and that the SETA domain was chosen precisely
because of its relationship with the Turkish government, given the likelihood that it would be
implicitly trusted by government officials targeted by the SMS text messages.
Iran is continuing to conduct mobile surveillance on its own citizens, minority ethnic groups, and
neighboring countries involved in strategic regional conflicts. BlackBerry researchers suspect
the increased interest in countries like Turkey is due to recently forged military ties with Russia.

In fewer than three years, Iran has drastically
improved the quality and complexity of its
Android malware, the sophistication of its
socially engineered delivery mechanisms,
the ability to pivot between domestic and
foreign target sets, and the implantation of
a cross-platform strategy that integrates
mobile and desktop malware.

The Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK)
North Korean APT groups have historically focused on traditional South Korean espionage
targets. A dramatic shift occurred in 2014 with the high profile and highly damaging attack against
Sony Pictures Entertainment. Following this attack North Korea gained a significant amount of
attention from western researchers who attempted to lift the fog surrounding North Korea’s larger
cyber strategy. Research efforts, like Novetta’s “Operation Blockbuster” did a phenomenal job of
detailing LAZARUS’ known malware at the time (Novetta, 2016).
That effort expanded to include North Korea’s mobile malware strategy. Following Novetta’s
landmark publication, both Palo Alto and McAfee published research about LAZARUS’ known
Android malware in 2017 (Kasza, Cortes, & Yates, 2017), (Han, 2017). With this connection made,
North Korea joined the league of government APT groups with an operational mobile surveillance
element in their offensive cyber strategy.

What’s worth noting about the research
into North Korean mobile malware is that
LAZARUS’ initial set of Android malware
was markedly different than that of other
nation-state APT group’s early work.
Instead of writing malware in Java, the language of the Android operating system and its apps,
LAZARUS elected instead to create native executable (ELF ARM) binaries to perform the malicious
functionality.
This strategy indicates one of the following:
• LAZARUS was either not comfortable enough with the Android platform to write for it, or
else they were simply accustomed to coding for Linux; or
• LAZARUS deliberately chose to avoid writing malware in Java for Android in order to attempt
to evade detection.
Whether intentional or not, LAZARUS’ mobile malware did in fact escape detection for a period
of time, but eventually this unique characteristic made their samples relatively easy to reliably
detect as well.
Most of the observed North Korean mobile malware has been trained on a range of targets in
South Korea, which seems to bear the brunt of most of their desktop malware attacks as well.

As a result of the Korean language barrier and the inherent interest of the South Korean
government to exaggerate the North Korean threat, much of the cutting-edge intelligence on
the mobile threat remains foggy. And even when BlackBerry researchers examined the Korean
language research and lifted one layer of that fog, another took its place, as detailed in the
next example.

SCARCRUFT — THE FOG OF FALSE FLAGS
While LAZARUS, which the US government also calls HIDDEN COBRA (US-CERT, 2017), has
earned the most media attention, it is worth remembering that is not the only North Korean
state-sponsored APT group in action. Another group, which Kaspersky first named SCARCRUFT
(a.k.a. APT37, GEUMSEONG121) is engaged in mobile malware campaigns that are the subject
of recent research from South Korean antivirus firm Alyac (Alyac, 2019).
Alyac described how SCARCRUFT began leveraging cloud provider services like DropBox
and Yandex to download additional malicious files and upload stolen data. One of the
more recent Android samples Alyac wrote about, from August 2019, carries the hash value
“8863dc53aba8dbaa7a76ab4653d54a4a7412dc9bb986b8fe1d3d8350bbb730f1.” In examining
this piece of Android malware, Alyac observed a direct crossover with similar desktop malware
being served from the same Dropbox account.

This crossover is significant because it
provides evidence that multiple North
Korean APT groups have implemented
a cross-platform strategy that combines
the simultaneous use of mobile and
desktop malware on the same target.
Interestingly, McAfee also documented the use of cloud providers by yet another likely North
Korean state-sponsored APT group called SUN TEAM in a blog post about the mobile monitoring
of North Korean defectors, which may expand the list to three such groups with this crossplatform surveillance capability (Min, 2018).
Shortly before that McAfee blog post, Alyac identified another interesting find in a second piece
of Korean-language research: strong evidence suggesting that SCARCRUFT attempted to plant
false flags in one of their extremely targeted operations against South Korea (Alyac, 2019). What
was even more interesting was the false flag pointed to LAZARUS. While it’s not entirely clear
why one North Korean APT group would wish to lead investigators and/or its target to believe
that another North Korean APT group was responsible, the implication is clear: a dense haze still
lingers over the internal workings of the North Korean government.

BlackBerry researchers established that the only reported state or state-sponsored APT group in
Vietnam, first identified by Chinese security company 360Safe and dubbed OCEANLOTUS (a.k.a.
APT32), has integrated mobile and desktop malware vertically in the same campaigns since the
very beginning of its observed activity. BlackBerry researchers delved into more of the mobile
aspects of OCEANLOTUS’ campaigns.
That OCEANLOTUS was even a player in the mobile malware arena had gone undetected until
just recently, when in August of 2019 an obscure Chinese antivirus company wrote about a
small number of different mobile operations conducted through 2017 (Antiy PTA Team, 2019).
BlackBerry researchers reviewed these findings and discovered additional IoCs associated with
this past activity which included evidence that OCEANLOTUS has been a player in the mobile
malware arena since at least early 2014, predating the identification and naming of the group
itself which occurred in May of 2015.
BlackBerry researchers assessed with a high degree of confidence that the mobile malware
campaigns identified are under the control of OCEANLOTUS, primarily due to code similarity to
known OCEANLOTUS desktop campaigns as well as simultaneous use of command-and-control
infrastructure for both these new mobile campaigns and separate novel desktop campaigns
associated with the group. What’s more, as alluded to above,

BlackBerry researchers observed
OCEANLOTUS engaged in cross-platform
attacks that involved both mobile and
desktop malware simultaneously in use on
the same target in the same campaign.

A NEW MOBILE CAMPAIGN: OPERATION OCEANMOBILE
In the newly identified operation BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION OCEANMOBILE,
they observed OCEANLOTUS initiate a mobile espionage campaign delivered via a sophisticated
trio of fake apps for Android. One of these apps supposedly provided support for high-resolution
graphics on the phone (e.g. for use in games), while another purported to block ads on your
phone, and a third presented itself as a browser and cache cleaner. The apps were distributed
through phishing, but also to a wider set of targets via third-party app stores as well as the official
Google Play Store.
It is worth noting that OCEANLOTUS distributed its apps in part via phishing, which connotes
a specific target. They also chose to seed the apps in several stores for anyone to download
anywhere, which suggests the net may have in fact been much wider, or perhaps entirely
indiscriminate.
For now, one question raised by the campaign caught our attention — namely exactly how it was
that the apps laden with malware made it into the Google Play Store itself? What BlackBerry
researchers discovered was that OCEANLOTUS went to the trouble of establishing an entire
fake backstory to give its malicious apps an air of legitimacy. They created modified GitHub
repositories that theoretically showed evidence of the developers’ code for each app, complete
with public facing “contact us” email addresses to answer any questions that might arise about
their “products.” They even went to lengths to concoct entire privacy policies for their apps, which
few people tend to actually read, but nevertheless was ironic, given that OCEANLOTUS’ entire
premise was to spy on its targets.
The newly discovered malware family these apps delivered, which BlackBerry researchers dubbed
PWNDROID1, was first identified by Russian antivirus company Dr. Web in 2019, though they
did not name it, nor were they able to attribute it to a specific group (Dr. Web Antivirus, 2019).
In reverse engineering the malware, it was particularly intriguing to observe that OCEANLOTUS
applied a technique commonly seen in desktop malware campaigns to help it escape detection
by scanning. They created an otherwise benign looking application which when analyzed in
detail would in fact load and execute an additional encrypted payload. This helped ensure that
the apps would pass muster with Google and App Store administrators and fly under the radar
of other antivirus companies.
Further technical information regarding the PWNDROID1 backdoors used in this newly revealed
operation that BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION OCEANMOBILE is as follows:

OCEANLOTUS has been a constant threat to Vietnamese targets of interest, regional players in

become available. They have readily adapted their malware to alternative platforms including
macOS, so it is not surprising to discover continuing operations in the Android space.

Target: Pakistan
In early August of 2019, India stripped the disputed Kashmir region of its autonomy, re-igniting a
decades-long row with its neighbor, Pakistan, who also claims authority over parts of the region.
There were thousands of arrests, a build-up of military forces and, for a period of nearly a month,
direct armed conflict between two nuclear-armed countries seemed imminent.

It should come as no surprise that the collective APT espionage effort targeting Pakistan has
been cross-platform and includes mobile malware, but evidence proving the assumption is
nevertheless sporadic and sparse. BlackBerry researchers identified two such campaigns and
will discuss their mobile dimension below. They each involve two, known, unattributed but likely
state-backed APT groups, BITTER and CONFUCIUS. While the latter group has been reported to
have used mobile malware before, the former has not.

30.3753°

Nearly all the governments with a developed cyber capability have an interest in, and ability to
spy on the Pakistani government and its influential military. Even APT groups with unattributed
state backing have had a go at it. BlackBerry researchers have written extensively about one
such group, THE WHITE COMPANY, previously (Livelli, Smith, & Gross, 2018).

In light of episodes like this, in addition to the constant churn of Pakistan’s often violent brand
of politics and its overnight celebrity as the conduit for China’s major Belt and Road Initiative,
Pakistan has remained one of the world’s most sought after espionage targets.

OPERATION DUALPAK — TARGET: PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT
A newly identified espionage campaign BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK
targets members of the Pakistani government. We assess that it is the work of a state-backed APT
group known as BITTER. This threat actor was first identified by Chinese security firm 360 in 2016.
BITTER is known for its relentless espionage campaigns targeting Pakistan. To a lesser degree,
it has also been observed targeting China, India and other countries in South Asia, as well as
Saudi Arabia. While their traditional desktop malware campaigns are well documented, we
believe OPERATION DUALPAK to be the first publicly documented instance in which newly
identified BITTER mobile malware that BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID2 has been
used. In addition, this operation also featured an unusually extensive, traditional desktop malware
campaign in parallel.
Like other APT groups discussed in this report, e.g. OCEANLOTUS, the chosen method of malware
distribution was fake apps, in this case distributed via SMS, WhatsApp, and various social media
platforms in June and July of 2019. What intrigued us was the choice of subject matter BITTER
selected for the malware-laden apps, which were designed to appeal to both low-brow and highbrow elements of the Pakistani government.
First, the low brow: One of the applications purported had an adult entertainment theme, calling
itself Pornhub Premium. Technical details regarding this phase of the operation are here:
All of the identified mobile malware samples communicated to the dynamic DNS domain
“newsbroadcastlive.ddns[.]net” which currently resolves to the IP address “188.215.229[.]220”.
• Based upon our initial investigation it appears that the applications were spread via various
platforms as discussed above in June and July of 2019. The URL shortener “tinyurl[.]com”
was employed in at least one phishing instance.
• The following shortened address: “http://tinyurl[.]com/y485gdjo” expanded to:
• “http://intlopenpipeservice[.]net/HBL/PornhubPremium.mp4.apk”
• An additional URL was identified which also served up the exact same APK, “http://
spiceworld.rf[.]gd/Premium.php” with a different filename “P-Hub Premium.apk”.
• “intlopenpipeservice[.]net” above resolved to “162.222.215[.]183” from January 2019 until
July 2019. Another domain of interest appeared on this IP address in July “rnail.googlle.
conn.pk.intlopenpipeservice[.]net” and was likely used to phish Gmail account credentials.

Following that trail, our research led us out
of the gutter and toward a series of new
malware samples which, in turn, connected
us to the high-brow method of delivery.

Perhaps the most interesting of those was a fake app purporting to bear association with the
Ansar Foundation. Ansar is a real UK-based NGO which has been operating in Pakistan for more
than a decade. Ansar is the Arabic word for “helper,” and according to its website the foundation
has conducted relief work for those affected by flood and earthquakes as well as victims caught
in military operations conducted in Northern Pakistan.
Although the evidence BlackBerry researchers uncovered in relation to the fake Ansar-related
malware did not indicate precise targeting, it did roughly coincide with the time a number of other
NGOs were kicked out of Pakistan.
One of the domains BITTER used in OPERATION DUALPAK, “wdibitmapservice[.]net”, overlapped
with multiple other unique IP addresses with a common set of related dynamic DNS domains
belonging to the same actor. This allowed BlackBerry researchers to conclude that this recent
Android campaign is highly likely to be associated with ongoing Windows targeting related
to BITTER.

OPERATION DUALPAK2 — TARGET: PAKISTAN MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT
BlackBerry researchers uncovered a second newly identified campaign dubbed OPERATION
DUALPAK2, which also targeted various Pakistani government departments as well as military
officials. The campaign features the well-integrated use of cross-platform malware aimed at both
mobile devices and desktop computers. Based on our research, OPERATION DUALPAK2 is the
work of another, well-known and likely state-sponsored APT called CONFUCIUS.
CONFUCIUS has historically targeted Pakistan for espionage and was first identified and named
by Palo Alto in 2016 (Lancaster & Yates, 2016). Following that report, TrendMicro has published
several additional papers and updates on the group.
Recently, researchers gave a talk in which they attempted to link several seemingly disparate
APT groups targeting Pakistan into a singular connected nexus (Lunghi & Jaromir, Linking
Cyberespionage Groups Targeting Victims in South Asia, 2019). They also alluded to the fact
that Phronesis, an Indian cybersecurity firm founded by former Indian military officers, is likely
involved with one or more of the activity sets which include APT groups known as PATCHWORK,
CONFUCIUS, URPAGE, HANGOVER, DONOT/EHDEVEL, and SNAKE IN THE GRASS. Whether this
ambitious assessment holds up over time remains to be seen.
For now, BlackBerry researchers delineate additional historic and recent mobile campaigns
conducted by CONFUCIUS. This is not the first time CONFUCIUS’ mobile operations were exposed;
in February of 2018, TrendMicro documented the use of fake chat apps that were created to
conduct mobile surveillance of isolated targets (Lunghi & Horejsi, Deciphering Confucius’
Cyberespionage Operations, 2018).
Following that disclosure by TrendMicro, CONFUCIUS adopted several new domains and
concurrently switched their other existing mobile operations to new IP addresses. But in their
retooling, they adopted a particularly interesting tactic to ensure that their mobile malware was
delivered only to desired targets — inserting a human element.

Never before had BlackBerry researchers
encountered an opportunity to interact
with the human face of an APT group live
during an ongoing espionage operation.
This presented a unique opportunity.
CONFUCIUS embedded a chat program on one of the websites used to distribute “dating/
romance” chat apps that really enabled CONFUCIUS to surveil its targets.

Figure 2: Screenshot of Phillionschat.com
As clearly demonstrated in the figure above, in order to receive the (malicious) iOS or Android
application one must click to initiate a conversation with the administrator. This was done through
an embedded JavaScript version of the RocketChat application which used the subdomain “web.
philionschat[.]com.” BlackBerry researchers were able to find an associated “web” subdomain
for each actively used domain involved in mobile distribution.
A newly identified Windows payload Blackberry researchers dubbed PWNWIN2 could easily be
downloaded from each individual site without any additional interaction and closely imitated one
of the previous operations (TweetyChat).
BlackBerry researchers attempted to initiate a conversation with CONFUCIUS but were shut
down pretty quickly, as seen in the figure below. Obviously, the time zone difference didn’t help,
but it also seemed CONFUCIUS did not want to provide the Android payload to us, or to chat:

Figure 3: BlackBerry Gets Rejected by CONFUCIUS
Other fake apps distributed by CONFUCIUS in this campaign carried a more serious tone,
including one that promised news about the crisis in Kashmir referenced above in the beginning
of this section.
Though espionage campaigns that do not bear the identity of the threat actor frequently do not
interest the press, operations like the two described above are arguably more disconcerting.
BITTER and CONFUCIUS bear all the hallmarks of government-sponsored resources and targeting
priorities. Their operations reveal a mature skillset that fluently interweaves both desktop and
mobile malware, as well as infrastructure and delivery methods for each. CONFUCIUS took the
extra step to develop realistic web pages and supporting applications to provide an additional
level of deception.

In stark contrast to nearly every other
government-related APT mobile campaign
discussed in this overview, this one bore
no overt political motivation. Instead
what BlackBerry researchers found was
conventional yet sophisticated espionage
targeting the nation’s military and government.

Conclusion
This report is intended to provide a detailed survey of the strategic and tactical use of mobile
malware by various governments. It attempts to fill in gaps from earlier research on the subject
of mobile malware to offer a new and redefined understanding of nation-state APT operations.
The conclusions drawn here are intelligence assessments representing judgments based on
available data.
Taken together, this report provides an examination of the complex nature of mobile espionage
campaigns deployed by different governments, revealing that previously held perceptions were
both shallow and incomplete. When the term APT comes to mind, everyone naturally tends to
explore what’s familiar: Windows, Mac, Linux, or the occasional odd industrial control system.
But as this report shows, the mobile space was already under attack for some time. In many
regards, mobile surveillance has always been an ingredient of individual nation-state’s APT
operations. Attacks on Android and iOS will undoubtedly become more prevalent and blended
into traditional desktop-centric operations.
The evidence is all around just waiting to be uncovered. Even so, the security solutions, antivirus
software, and incident response services that might have detected these operations are only
now starting to appear in a significant way. Mobile security is definitely an area that needs to be
more fully addressed, but we are already a decade behind.
The public-facing security research on targeted mobile threats has pioneered a new way forward.
Good mobile research was sporadically published in the past and, in many cases, presented as
a niche phenomenon — another subdiscipline for specialization. Research that examines threats
holistically is hard to come by.
BlackBerry hopes this report conveys a deeper appreciation for how the Chinese, Vietnamese,
Iranians, North Koreans and other state-backed groups view, implement and execute upon
their mobile strategies. Although considerably different, those strategies had a common
denominatora — they all approached the mobile facet in a way that ran counter to how the
overwhelming majority of the security industry treats it. All the APT groups BlackBerry surveyed
purposefully interwove mobile malware into their espionage operations not as a niche effort,
but as a holistic one.
Looking ahead, businesses and other organizations that are grappling with how to build resilience
against a relentless onslaught of cyber espionage campaigns would do well to adjust their
strategy to incorporate mobile defense, both for company-issued smartphones as well as those
permitted for use in a “bring your own device” plan.
Governments and policy experts hard at work defining deterrence strategies, cyber norms and
red lines in the international community will be challenged by what the findings reveal and
portend regarding the incorporation of mobile threats into the broader espionage picture. There
is considerably more than is covered in this comprehensive report to reveal and comprehend.
