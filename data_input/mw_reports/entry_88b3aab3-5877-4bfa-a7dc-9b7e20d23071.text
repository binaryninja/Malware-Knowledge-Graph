I am Ironman: DEEP PANDA Uses Sakula Malware
to Target Organizations in Multiple Sectors
THE ADVERSARY LINE-UP

24 NOV 2014

MATT DAHL

Over the last few months, the CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking a campaign of
highly targeted events focused on entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), healthcare,
government, and technology sectors. This campaign infected victims with Sakula malware
variants that were signed with stolen certiﬁcates. Investigation into this activity led to associations
with the adversary known to CrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.

On 31 July 2014, an executable was identiﬁed, which, at the time, was not detected by any antivirus products. When this ﬁle was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by using the
ShellExecute() API to open a URL. The site’s domain name was meant to spoof that of a site set
up to provide information on an alumni event for a U.S university. This page requested that the
visitor download an Adobe-related plugin in order to view the content. The downloaded plugin ﬁle
included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]

The Sakula malware in this campaign utilized the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading
technique most commonly associated with PlugX activity. In the aforementioned universityrelated incidents, a legitimate executable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash:
d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a ﬁle named msi.dll (MD5 hash:
ae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the Sakula executable
(MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This ﬁnal executable was also signed with a
certiﬁcate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.

Command-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address
180.210.206.246; a sample GET request is below:

Further investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when similar
TTPs were used to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company with highproﬁle clients in the defense sector. Two other incidents were also identiﬁed in August 2014
targeting a company in the DIB and a Mongolian government entity.

All incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers masquerading
as installers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper VPN, and Microsoft
ActiveX Control. They display progress bars that make it appear as if the speciﬁed software is
being updated or installed.

Example of Installer Progress Bar Displayed by Dropper

In addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services speciﬁc to the target
organization like webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the
victims were directed to legitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which victims
were sent to a login page hosted on a domain that spoofed that of the legitimate one. It is unclear
whether redirecting victims to these login pages was part of credential-collection activity or merely
meant to deceive victims into believing that the activity was legitimate.

Example of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to

The campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a ﬁle was recently discovered that
suggests it may be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian government
entity, and the ﬁle masqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software. It dropped the
side-loaded Sakula malware just like in the other incidents; however, in this instance, the Sakula
payload was signed with a certiﬁcate assigned to a different organization, Career Credit Co., Ltd.
The malware used the domain www[.]xha-mster[.]com for C2 which was created in midSeptember and is registered with the email address wendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name
“tonyy starke” (hence the name, Ironman-related title for this blog).

Below is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.

The bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address
(198.200.45.112) used this campaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA activity.

Association with Recent Scanbox Activity

In September 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence identiﬁed a malicious ﬁle signed with the
DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd. certiﬁcate. Analysis of this ﬁle revealed it to be Derusbi malware (a favorite
RAT of DEEP PANDA) that used the domain vpn[.]foundationssl[.]com for its C2. At the time of
discovery, CrowdStrike did not attribute the ﬁle to DEEP PANDA based on the malware alone,
but the use of the DTOPTOOLZ certiﬁcate to sign a malware variant known to be heavily used by
this adversary makes it likely that this signed Derusbi sample is also attributable to DEEP
PANDA.

In a recent public report from PWC, another foundationssl[.]com domain was linked to activity
involving the Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) framework more commonly known as
Scanbox. In that operation, the Scanbox code was placed on the website of a U.S.-based think
tank and utilized the malicious domain, news[.]foundationssl[.]com. The use of the two
foundationssl[.]com subdomains suggests that the same adversary (in this case DEEP PANDA)
was responsible for the signed Derusbi malware ﬁle and the think tank SWC activity.
Furthermore, CrowdStrike publicly reported on DEEP PANDA targeting of think tanks in July
2014.

[1] In February 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on a campaign that leveraged Sakula
malware (http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/french-connection-french-aerospace-focused-cve-

2014-0322-attack-shares-similarities-2012/index.html); however, the Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs) between that campaign and this recent one are different, suggesting two
distinct adversaries are using the Sakula malware.
