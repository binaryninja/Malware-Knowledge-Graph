In today's post I will be analyzing and reversing a new credential stealer that has recently hit
the market. I'll be showing it's control flow, how it steals data and the methods it uses to be
able to grab information off of its victims.
I would like to preface this post with the fact that this is my first formal analysis of a piece of
malware, I may have jumped to conclusions about some functions and may have got things
slightly wrong here and there. If you notice any errors please contact me and I hope that I
can learn from these mistakes. That being said, enjoy.
Nexus is a new stealer that has recently hit the marketplace of a popular crime forum, its
sales thread boasts that it steals from multiple commonly found programs and will send this
data to an easy to use web panel. Here the actor is able to read logs that have been sent
from infected computers, mark them as checked and also tag them with a comment. The
actor can also add a direct link to any windows executable that the malware will then
download & execute. The thread claims that the stealer will steal data from the following
programs:
Chromium browsers
Yandex-Browser
.dat files of cryptocurrency wallets
Authy
Telegram
Discord
Steam
FileZilla
WinSCP
TotalCommander
WindowsSecureVault
Internet Explorer & Edge
Pidgin
PSI & PSI+
NordVPN & ProtonVPN

Text file grabber
The malware will also take a screenshot of the computer upon execution and will also get
general information about the computer such as username, CPU, GPU, memory and
installed programs. The author states that the program has been developed in C++ and has
a file size of 460kb. Nexus is sold for 100$ and provides free updates after purchase. The
seller is clearly from Russia due to the clear indication of google translate from Russian to
English in the sales thread. The sales thread can be read here I have censored the contact
details as to not give him any exposure. Here are some screenshots of the panel:

Now onto the analysis, I use Ghidra as my decompiler due to it being a free tool with a good
pseudo code generator that makes reversing much easier than reading raw assembly. Along
with Ghidra I also use x32dbg to be able to step through the program and see exactly what it
is doing. I have already gone through the file in Ghidra and renamed functions so that the
decompilation makes sense. Let's first take a look at how the program hides its console
window.

The program uses a call to a WinAPI function called GetConsoleWindow to get a handle of
the window, it then uses this handle and 0 as parameters for the "ShowWindow" function to
hide the console window.

The program then calls a function of "get_HWID" that will use the "GetCurrentHwProfileA"
function to get the hardware profile. It will then copy the returned Guid into a string. The set
variable function will check data and if it is not correctly set it will exit the program.

The program then gets the documents folder directory by using "SHGetFolderPathA", and
sets it as the current directory. After this it creates a folder with the HWID folder name and
will set that folder as the new current directory. Nexus will then put the
"%ALLUSERSPROFILE%" directory into a variable. After this is completed it will take a
screenshot and save it into the newly created HWID folder. This folder is where Nexus will
store all of it's collected data and I will refer to it as the temp folder.

After this the stealer then generates a path to the Discord local storage directory where the
login token is stored. It will then check if the directory exists, if so it will create a Discord
folder in the temporary logs folder and then copy the local storage files into this. If this copy
fails then the folder it has created is removed. The same technique is then used to grab the
local storage directory of Authy. The developer has probably copied and pasted the discord
function and then changed it slightly to support stealing Authy session files..

5/17

The program then creates a "Grabber.zip" zip file in the temp directory and then recurses
through the "Desktop", "Downloads" & "Documents" folders and checks for any ".docx", ".txt"
and ".rtf" files which it will then copy into the zip.

6/17

After grabbing text files Nexus will attempt to grab data from WinSCP. Firstly it opens the
"Software\\Martin Prikryl\\WinSCP 2\\Sessions" registry key using "RegOpenKeyExA" and
then it will query this key for "HostName", "UserName" & "Password" this is all then written to
a log file named "WinSCP.log". The program also use the same registry technique to grab
data from Telegram.
7/17

Next up is FileZilla where Nexus does the same technique of grabbing data from where the
program saves it's credentials and writes these to a log file called "filezilla.log". If the
extraction of this data fails or the program does not exist then the log file will be deleted. The
same technique is used to grab data from Pidgin, TotalCommander, PSI & PSI+.

This screenshot shows about half of the wallets that Nexus steals from. The technique is
once again the same where it simply checks for the existence of the wallet directory and then
grabs the dat file from them. These are all written into the "Crypto" folder in the temp
directory.

The next operation is to steal Steam data, oddly the strings used to steal this data are
base64 encoded which leads me to believe that this function was copy and pasted due to no
other stealing functions being processed this way. It decodes the directory string and then
checks if the registry keys exist. If it does then Nexus will begin to grab information by
copying files based on the registry information it queries. This is all then placed into a
"Steam" directory in the temp folder.

To get computer information the program queries "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
NT\\CurrentVersion" in the registry and grabs the windows version name. It then writes it to
the information log. After this it uses a function to get the OS language and again writes it to
the computer information log. Once the information has been written, the username,

hostname & processor are also then written to the log. After this the GPU, and memory are
grabbed and a recursive function is called to get all of the installed programs by seeing what
programs are in the uninstall page in the control panel.

VPN files and sessions are then grabbed in the same way as many of the other programs
are stolen from by copying important data that the programs write to disk. These are all then
copied into their relative directories in the temp folder.
Next up is browsers. Same old with non-standard browsers, Nexus just copies important files
and formats them and then writes them into their respective log files.

12/17

To grab any data that isn't written to disk the program will query the local databases of the
browsers for the needed information and in doing this will grab the following information:
Passwords, Credit cards, Cookies, AutoFill forms, Browsing history, Download history,
Search engine history

Now that Nexus has carried out all of it's stealing functions it then gets some more
information about the computer and formats it to send it as the POST body to the c2. It then
puts all of the information gathered into a zip called "t.zip" and sends the data.The function to
create the POST body looks like this.

14/17

The function first gets some directories then gets the HWID and current windows version, it
also base64 decodes some version information and gets statistics on the information it has
stolen to then send to the panel. The information is added into a string delimited with '~;^;'
which is then stored in a variable to be sent along with the new zip file.

15/17

The program base64 decodes the c2 domain and gate file and creates a request to it using
"HttpOpenRequestA", then after this it copies the zip into the request and sends it. After this
the internet handle is closed. The temporary directory will be then be deleted along with
"t.zip". The data is sent again for some reason but this time Nexus looks for a return string of
a direct link to a windows executable and will call a download and execute function to drop
and run it.

If by some miracle nothing else in the binary has managed to trip up an anti-virus this surely
will. After this the program just exits without deleting itself.
In conclusion Nexus stealer is a pretty normal stealer, nothing special and nothing new. It will
probably be detected by most modern anti-viruses. It gets the job done and I am pretty
certain that the c2 has been copied from another prominent stealer named Vidar/Arkei. Since
starting my analysis on Nexus stealer it has been updated to include the following new
features.
Collecting OpenVPN Session and Authorization Data
Collection of detailed information about Steam (based on customer wishes)
WiFi Profile Data Collection
Collecting profiles from Credmanager
Saving cookies in .log and .txt formats (based on customer wishes)
Fixed error creating data directories
Chromium autocomplete collection fixed
See you next time & thanks for reading!
