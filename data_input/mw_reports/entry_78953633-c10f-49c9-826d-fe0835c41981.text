ICS-CERT Introduction
America’s economic and national security relies on the resilience
and reliability of the Nation’s critical infrastructure (CI).
Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), “Critical Infrastructure
Security and Resilience,” identifies 16 CI sectors (see table below).
The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
Team’s (ICS-CERT) mission is to assist owners of CI in the 16
sectors to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of their
industrial control systems (ICSs). In addition to working with
ICS owners, operators, and vendors, ICS-CERT coordinates
its efforts with Federal, state, local, and tribal governments.
ICS-CERT operates within the National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), a division of the
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Protection
and Programs Directorate (NPPD).
NCCIC’s mission is to operate at the intersection of the private
sector, civilian, law enforcement, intelligence, and defense
communities, applying unique analytic perspectives, ensuring
shared situational awareness, and orchestrating synchronized

response efforts while protecting the Constitutional and
privacy rights of Americans in both the cybersecurity and
communications domains.
ICS-CERT’s activities are composed of four operations functions
and four risk reduction functions. Operations functions include
incident response, vulnerability coordination, situational
awareness, and technical analysis. Risk reduction functions
include cybersecurity assessments, the Cyber Security
Evaluation Tool (CSET), training, and the Industrial Control
Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG).
CI asset owners benefit from ICS-CERT’s cybersecurity services
in many ways, including an increased awareness of emerging
threats, state-of-the-art analysis, incident response support,
established partnerships, and collaboration with other agencies
and partners. By extension, Americans benefit from ICS-CERT’s
work with access to a more secure and resilient CI, which
undergirds our economy and provides many of the critical
services we rely on every day.

ICS-CERT 2014 Highlights
• Havex and BlackEnergy Activities: The ICS-CERT Team
conducted an action campaign to provide classified
briefings with contextual and detailed information
about Havex and BlackEnergy malware for private
sector CI asset owners. These briefings covered
15 cities, from November 25 through December
11. ICS-CERT also hosted a webinar and released
multiple alerts and advisories with detailed actionable
information related to the malware characteristics
as well as methods for detecting compromise and
improving cyber defenses. ICS-CERT reached nearly
1,400 participants across all 16 CI sectors with these
briefings.
• Heartbleed OpenSSL Activities: The Vulnerability
Coordination Team released detailed and timely
advisories, conducted briefings, and hosted two
webinars featuring the original researchers who
discovered the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability. The
team acted quickly to identify affected ICS products
and developed multiple alerts in coordination with the
vendor community to prevent any major incidents.
• Onsite Assessments: The ICS-CERT Assessments Team
deployed to 21 different states, conducting 104 onsite

cybersecurity assessments to assist CI asset owners in
strengthening the overall cybersecurity posture of
their ICSs.
• “Safeguard” Assessments: ICS-CERT and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Office of
Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) introduced a
new technical service offering entitled “Safeguard.”
This engagement provided select asset owners with
proactive and customized cyber assessment services
based on their specific interest and area of focus.
• Online Training: The ICS-CERT Training Team launched
new online training modules with a blended learning
approach, which makes accessing course material
easier and more efficient, reduces redundancy in
training materials, and eliminates the need to travel to
participate in ICS-CERT training.
• CSET Tool: The CSET Development Team released two
new versions of CSET in 2014, CSET 6.0 in February
and CSET 6.1 in August. The latest version includes the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Framework, which allows asset owners to create their
own question sets and provides industry organizations
the ability to collaborate in creating and sharing
question sets.

ICS-CERT Watch Floor Operations
Information Sharing and Situational Awareness
The ICS-CERT watch floor is staffed by approximately
two dozen analysts and incident handlers across two
geographically separate watch floor locations. These
watch floors handled numerous operational activities,
which include responding to reported cyber incidents,
providing recovery and mitigation support, vulnerability
coordination and analysis, interfacing with law enforcement
and the Intelligence Community, and providing situational
awareness alerts and advisories to warn of cyber threats
affecting the Nation’s critical infrastructure. In 2014,
ICS-CERT expanded its information sharing initiatives
through webinars and teleconferences with public and
private sector partners. ICS-CERT also works closely with
Information Sharing Analysis Centers (ISACs), researchers,
vendors, sector specific agencies, industry associations,
and other partners across the Nation’s 16 CI sectors to
coordinate cyber risk reduction efforts. In fact, it is these

4

strong partnerships with key stakeholders across all sectors
and government agencies that put ICS-CERT in the unique
position of providing clear situational awareness of the
threat landscape and associated defensive measures. Timely
and accurate information is essential to cybersecurity
preparedness.
In 2014, ICS-CERT tracked and responded to multiple
newly discovered cyber campaigns that had been ongoing
for several years. The delayed time to discovery, coupled
with the tactics of the threat actors, was of great concern
to ICS-CERT, particularly when considering the potential
for a large victim footprint across the Nation’s CI sectors.
Accordingly, ICS-CERT leveraged well-established
relationships to encourage asset owners to be more
proactive in reporting incidents, which then provided a
better understanding of the depth and breadth of these
campaigns by sophisticated threat actors. Asset owners

Vulnerability Coordination
ICS-CERT coordinates vulnerability activities with ICS
owners, operators, and vendors and with Federal, state,
local, and tribal governments to reduce the likelihood of a
successful cyber attack against CI control systems.
The ICS-CERT vulnerability handling process involves five
basic steps: 1) detection and collection, 2) analysis, 3)
mitigation coordination, 4) application of mitigation, and
5) disclosure. ICS-CERT attempts to coordinate all reported
vulnerabilities with the associated vendor and works to
publicly disclose the vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
In November 2014, the Vulnerability Coordination team
released a Vulnerability Coordination report detailing its
activities from 2010–2013. This report provides trend
analysis for all vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT and
gives descriptions, details, and metrics for the most
commonly identified vulnerabilities. The report shows
that improper input validation, at 61 percent of reported
vulnerabilities, is by far the most common.

Heartbleed Vulnerability
The Vulnerability Coordination team devoted a significant
amount of time and effort to combating the Heartbleed
OpenSSL vulnerability in 2014. These efforts resulted in the
release of several advisories, briefings, and two webinars
on the topic. The advisories listed vendors and products
reported to be vulnerable and announced vendor patches as
soon as they became available. The advisories also included
methods for asset owners to determine whether they were
running vulnerable products. To defend against exploitation,
Snort signatures and other signatures suggested by the FBI
were provided to asset owners for use in determining if
they were actively being exploited. ICS-CERT’s first webinar
on the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability was aimed at a
more limited audience of vendors and some asset owners.
The second webinar was open to a wider audience. Each
webinar featured an explanation of Heartbleed from the
original researchers who discovered the vulnerability.

Technical Analysis
The Advanced Analytical Laboratory (AAL) provides research
and analysis capabilities in support of the incident response,
assessment, and vulnerability coordination activities of
ICS-CERT. The AAL’s expert cybersecurity researchers perform
forensic analysis on digital media, reverse engineer malware,
and respond to cyber incidents with both onsite and remote
capacity. When possible, analytical efforts are performed
remotely in a laboratory environment using custom tools and
techniques. In some cases, however, onsite analysis is required
and a team is deployed to perform analytical efforts directly on
the owner’s network. In 2014, the AAL focused on automating
and streamlining the lab’s analytical capabilities. Improvements
for the year included the following:
• Completion of a remote incident response network
(RIRN). The RIRN allows analysts to remotely and
securely perform an incident response engagement with
an asset owner. After an initial equipment installation,
AAL analysts can remotely sweep the asset owner’s
network for indications of compromise. This allows
analysts to spend multiple weeks on an engagement
and provides a thorough, in-depth examination of the
company’s network.

• Automation and integration of forensic analysis tools in a
suite called the Analyst Network Tool (ANT). ANT brings
together custom and commercial forensic tools in an
integrated environment, allowing multiple drive images
to be processed simultaneously, reducing the amount
of analyst hands-on time. ANT has greatly reduced the
turnaround time for digital forensic analysis, providing
faster results to companies responding to a compromise.
• Development of a custom application, called the
Correlating Extensive Incident Response (CEIR) tool, to
analyze data collected during an incident response. The
CEIR tool allows the user to consolidate the many types
of data collected into a single, user-friendly database and
helps identify known and unknown threats. The AAL
uses the CEIR tool in both onsite and remote incident
response engagements.
With these improved analytical capabilities, the AAL performed
in-depth analysis of numerous malware samples associated with
multiple watering hole and ICS-focused threat campaigns. These
efforts helped uncover sophisticated threat actor techniques
and tactics, which allowed ICS-CERT to publish multiple alerts
warning the community of the threat and providing information
for detecting and mitigating intrusion activity.

Assessments
In FY 2014, ICS-CERT conducted 104 onsite cybersecurity
assessments. These assessments, which are based on standards,
guidelines, and best practices, assist the Nation’s CI asset
owners to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of their
ICSs. The assessment methodology provides a structured
framework that asset owners and operators can use repeatedly
to assess, re-assess, protect, detect, and continually validate the
cybersecurity of their ICS networks.
ICS-CERT’s onsite cybersecurity assessment services include the
following assessment types:
• Onsite guided Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET)
Assessment
• Design Architecture Review (DAR)
• Network Architecture Verification and Validation
(NAVV).
CSET is a stand-alone software tool that enables users to
assess their network and cybersecurity methodology against
recognized industry and government standards, guidelines,
and best practices. ICS-CERT released two new versions of the
CSET tool in 2014: CSET 6.0, released in February, included
the ability to trend, compare, and merge assessments; and

10

CSET 6.1, released in August, included the NIST Framework,
which allows asset owners to create their own question sets
and provides industry organizations the ability to collaborate in
creating and sharing question sets.
The DAR assessment provides ICS asset owners with a
comprehensive evaluation and discovery process, focusing
on defense strategies associated with an asset owner’s specific
control systems network. The DAR includes an in-depth
review and evaluation of the control system’s network
design, configuration, interdependencies, and its applications.
ICS-CERT provides a detailed DAR report, and with expert
guidance, positions the requesting facility’s ICS for improved
security and resiliency.
The NAVV assessment provides a sophisticated analysis of
network packet-data, which is collected by the asset owner
from within their control system network environment.
ICS-CERT passively analyzes the data using a combination of
open source and commercially available tools, and develops
detailed representation of the communications flows and
relationships between devices. The NAVV also provides a
practical method for asset owners to baseline the deterministic
network traffic occurring within the control systems

Training
Training is a critical component of the ICS-CERT
program. ICS-CERT performs outreach activities through
training and education programs to help CI sectors and
the control systems community better understand the
cybersecurity risks associated with ICSs. In 2014, the
program adopted a blended learning approach to enhance
training opportunities. A new course, Introduction to
ICS Cybersecurity, blends web-based and instructor-led
methods. The curriculum is made up of ten modules and is
available online at no cost.
The challenges solved by the blended learning approach
are three-fold. First, trainees have asked for materials in a
format that is more efficient and easier to access. Web-based
training allows trainees to access the course on their own
time in a setting that allows for asynchronous interaction,
and it is self-paced to better fit trainees’ work schedules.

12

The second challenge was to reduce redundancy in the
training materials. As the ICS-CERT Cybersecurity Training
Program has matured and developed new course materials
to support its growth, the courses were designed to build
on each other. Ideally, a trainee would complete the
Introduction to ICS Cybersecurity course, followed by
Intermediate Level courses, and eventually complete the
5-day, hands-on Technical Level ICS Cybersecurity Training.
These courses have no prerequisites for enrolling and
include a test-out option. As a result, trainees can begin
courses at the level appropriate to their cybersecurity
experience and knowledge with the confidence that they
are prepared for the more technical course work. To further
streamline the online training process and eliminate
redundancy, ICS-CERT has removed remedial material from
the more technical courses.
The third challenge for some people is the travel required
to participate in training. Web-based courses alleviate the
time, cost, and inconvenience of traveling to attend multiple
in-person sessions.

IC S -C ERT Year in Rev iew — 2014

In addition to blending methods and creating web-based
modules, the program employs a learning management
system (LMS). The LMS is a software application for the
administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and
delivery of training courses. The benefits of this service are
as follows:
• Creates a unique user ID and provides credit for course
completion.
• Provides training courses using varied multimedia
approaches (video, audio, PowerPoint, Flash).
• Facilitates interoperability between eLearning software
products through compliance with Sharable Content
Object Reference Model (SCORM) web-based training
courses.
• Enables live training events, training invitations, selfregistration, and attendance tracking.
• Assists in tracking, analyzing, and reporting course
statistics.

Over 4,760 trainees have initiated online training and have
accessed the courses from multiple states and countries.
Additional ICS-CERT Training highlights for 2014 include
the following:
• Initiated online introductory and intermediate courses
in 10 modules.
• Resumed quarterly regional training, which takes
introductory and intermediate classroom training
to trainees in their own region. In 2014, regional
classroom training was held in Alabama and Houston.
Five regional classroom training sessions are planned
for 2015.
• Provided 11 technical-level cybersecurity training
sessions to 436 participants. These 5-day courses
provide intensive hands-on training and a 12-hour,
red team/blue team exercise that simulates a corporate
espionage scenario.

• Ensures course availability on desktop or mobile device
(iPads, iPhones, or Android devices).

Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group
The ICS-CERT established the Industrial Control Systems
Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) to enhance collaboration
between ICS stakeholders and facilitate partnerships
between the Federal Government and private sector owners
and operators in all CI sectors. The goal of the ICSJWG is
to secure CI by accelerating the design, development, and
deployment of secure ICS.

2014 Spring Meeting
The ICSJWG 2014 Spring Meeting was held in Indianapolis,
Indiana, and was attended by approximately 220 people,
including asset owners and operators, government
professionals, vendors, systems integrators, and academic
professionals from around the globe. Key highlights from
the meeting were an opening keynote presentation by
Indiana Governor Mike Pence as well as two more keynote

14

presentations from CS&C Deputy Assistant Secretary Gregory
Touhill and NCCIC Director Larry Zelvin. Presentations also
included demos and lightning round talks that offered the
opportunity for attendees to discuss the latest initiatives
impacting the security of ICSs and the risk of threats and
vulnerabilities to these systems.

2014 Fall Meeting
The ICSJWG 2014 Fall Meeting was held in Idaho Falls,
Idaho, hosting approximately 175 attendees from the
worldwide community. This meeting included a classified
briefing and tours of the Idaho National Laboratory
facilities. Further highlights include keynote remarks by the
DHS Assistant Secretary for CS&C, Dr. Andy Ozment. Because
of the positive reception of demonstrations and lightning
round talks in previous meetings, those venues were
expanded to allow more opportunity for participation.

IC S -C ERT Year in Rev iew — 2014

The ICSJWG Steering Team
The ICSJWG Steering Team (IST) held its first face-to-face
meeting in Indianapolis and discussed a variety of topics,
including ways to improve the ICSJWG bi-annual meetings
and the overall working group moving forward. The IST
is made up of members representing roles such as asset
owners; vendors; state, local, and tribal governments;
industry associations; university/academia; consultants/
integrators; and the international community. By bringing
this diverse group together, the ICSJWG hopes to improve
the partnership between the public and private sectors in
working together to secure our Nation’s CI.

ICSJWG Webinars
Another outreach opportunity the ICSJWG has offered to
the community is a series of webinars that focus on specific
topics related to ICS cybersecurity. During FY 2014, ICSJWG
webinars covered various topics, including the following:

• I Think, Therefore I Fuzz—demonstration explaining
the fuzzing process and how fuzzing can help users
find their systems’ vulnerabilities before attackers.
• Online Real Time Monitoring for Change
Identification—introduction to the Sophia software
tool that assists control system owners in learning how
their systems communicate and quickly identify new
and unexpected connections.
• The New Paradigm for Information Security:
Assumption of Breach—review and discussion of
the change from a defined perimeter defense to
an assumption of breach of critical systems and
suggestions on how to respond.
The ICSJWG is looking forward to offering a flexible and
resilient approach as well as a substantial platform for the
public and private sectors to collaborate on cybersecurity
for the global infrastructure in FY 2015.

15

Moving Forward
In 2015, ICS-CERT will continue to improve cybersecurity
capabilities and extend services in support of all ICS
stakeholders in the 16 CI sectors. ICS-CERT will continue
coordination efforts with industry and government partners
to mitigate cyber risks to CI through timely and effective
sharing of situational awareness information and mitigation
strategies.
To further improve onsite assessments, ICS-CERT will
pursue more one-on-one engagements with CI asset owners
on the use of CSET and assist them in identifying gaps and
developing strategies for improving their defensive posture.
The Assessment team’s SafeGuard Initiative will also further
aid asset owners in the Energy industry to assess critical
assets for intrusion and security gaps.
In addition to extending onsite assessments, ICS-CERT
will develop and publish control system specific technical
guidance related to recommended practices and defensive

16

strategies for protecting against ever-evolving threats. These
guidance documents will send a clear message about what
ICS-CERT finds important and which threats are of greatest
concern.
Other goals for 2015 include improving and expanding
ICS-CERT technical teams and tools, which will provide
greater value during incident response and assessment
activities. We will also continue to improve training
offerings and expanded training curriculum, which will
allow CI asset owners to better meet the demands of
challenging and evolving technical issues in control system
security.
It is uncertain what new cybersecurity threats will
emerge in 2015, but ICS-CERT stands prepared to meet
the challenge and help CI asset owners prevent attacks or
mitigate their harmful effects.
