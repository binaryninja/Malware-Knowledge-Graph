Russian SVR Targets U.S. and Allied Networks
Executive summary
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) actors (also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes) frequently use
publicly known vulnerabilities to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems in an effort to
obtain authentication credentials to allow further access. This targeting and exploitation encompasses U.S. and allied
networks, including national security and government-related systems.
Recent Russian SVR activities include compromising SolarWinds® Orion® software updates,[1] targeting COVID-19
research facilities through deploying WellMess malware,[2] and leveraging a VMware® vulnerability that was a zero-day at
the time for follow-on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication abuse.[3] SVR cyber actors also used
authentication abuse tactics following SolarWinds-based breaches.[4] [5]
The SVR has exploited—and continues to successfully exploit—software vulnerabilities to gain initial footholds into victim
devices and networks, to include:







CVE-2018-13379 Fortinet®[2]
CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra®[2]
CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure®[2]
CVE-2019-19781 Citrix®[2]
CVE-2020-4006 VMware®[3]

The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) previously shared mitigations to defend against exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Knowing the
tradecraft that nation-state cyber actors use along with relevant response actions will enable network defenders to focus
on mitigating the vulnerabilities and techniques, enabling more comprehensive protection against adversary compromise.

NSA, CISA, & FBI | Russian SVR Targets U.S. and Allied Networks
Detailed vulnerabilities and mitigations
NSA, CISA, and FBI are aware that United States Government, critical infrastructure (including Defense Industrial Base),
and allied networks are consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Russian state-sponsored cyber actors. NSA,
CISA, and FBI recommend that critical system owners prioritize the following mitigation actions to mitigate the loss of
sensitive information that could impact U.S. policies, strategies, plans, ongoing operations, and competitive advantage.
Additionally, due to the various systems and networks that could be impacted outside of these sectors, NSA, CISA, and
FBI recommend that the following mitigations be prioritized for action by all network defenders.
The techniques leveraged by SVR actors include 1:








Exploiting public-facing applications (T11902)
Leveraging external remote services (T1133)
Compromising supply chains (T1195)
Using valid accounts (T1078)
Exploiting software for credential access (T1212)
Forging web credentials: SAML tokens (T1606.002)

While some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following general mitigations apply:









Keep systems and products updated and patch as soon as possible after patches are released since many actors
exploit numerous vulnerabilities.3
Expect that the risk from data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before a device was
patched will not be alleviated by patching or simple remediation actions. Assume that a breach will happen, enforce
least-privileged access, and make password changes and account reviews a regular practice.4
Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.5
Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations. 6
Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce exposure of the internal network.7
Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and authentication functions. Continuously hunt for signs of
compromise or credential misuse, particularly within cloud environments.8
Adopt a mindset that compromise happens: prepare for incident response activities, only communicate about
breaches on out-of-band channels, and take care to uncover a breach’s full scope before remediating.9

The following is a list of specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) being actively exploited by SVR actors, a
description of the vulnerability, and the recommended mitigations.
