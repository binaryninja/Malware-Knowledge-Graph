砂嵐大作戦

OPERATION
DUST STORM
ATTACK TIMELINE

March to August 2013
Attack activity greatly
subsides, although several
new domains that will be
used later are registered.

February 2014
Watering hole attack on a popular
software reseller delivers an
Internet Explorer zero-day to a
number of unsuspecting targets.
The group begins locating and
securing alternative means of
persistence on victim systems.

July to August 2011
2010
Early operations are
extremely blunt, relatively
unsophisticated, and
readily picked up by the
security industry.

Attack group
attempts to gather
user credentials for
Yahoo, Windows Live,
and other accounts
through several different
phishing domains.

February 2015
A second-stage
implant delivered by a
variant of the S-Type
backdoor shortly
following its initial
reconnaissance compromises
the investment arm of a
major Japanese Automaker
just two weeks before 11
auto worker unions demand a
monthly raise of 6,000 yen.

October 2011

2011
Attacks leverage an
unpatched Internet
Explorer 8 vulnerability
to gain a foothold into
victim networks and
start to garner
some notoriety.

May 2015

Attack group attempts to
take advantage of the
ongoing Libyan crisis by
phishing the news cycle
regarding Muammar
Gaddafi’s death, targeting
US defense targets.

June 2012
Attack campaign
leverages previously
used flash exploit and
Internet Explorer
zero-day.

Attack group
adopts and customizes
several Android backdoors
to suit their purposes and uses
a massive infrastructure
compared to previous attacks.
Initial backdoors are relatively
simple, but continually forward
all SMS messages and call
information back to their C2
servers. All identified victims
reside in Japan or South Korea.

2015
A number of second-stage
backdoors with hardcoded
proxy addresses and
credentials compromise
a number of Japanese
companies involved in
power generation, oil
and natural gas,
construction, finance,
and transportation.

July & October 2015
Two new waves of attacks
are launched, targeting
multiple Japanese
companies including a
Japanese subsidiary of
a South Korean electric
utility and a major
Japanese oil and gas
company. The most likely
goals are reconnaissance
and long-term espionage.

2016
SPEAR believes that
attacks of this nature
into companies
involved in Japanese
critical infrastructure
and resources are
ongoing and likely to
continue to escalate
in the future.
