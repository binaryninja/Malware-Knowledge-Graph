Taiwanese security firm links APT10 Chinese espionage group to attacks on local
financial sector.
Attacks targeted a vulnerability in a security product used by roughly 80% of the
Taiwanese financial sector.
Initially, the espionage campaign went undetected because it was misidentified as a
credential stuffing attack.
A hacking group affiliated with the Chinese government is believed to have carried out
a months-long attack against Taiwan’s financial sector by leveraging a vulnerability in
a security software solution used by roughly 80% of all local financial organizations.

The attacks are believed to have started at the end of November 2021 and were still taking
place this month, according to a report shared with The Record today by Taiwanese security
firm CyCraft.
The company attributed the intrusions—which it tracked under the codename of Operation
Cache Panda—to a well-known Chinese cyber-espionage group known in the cybersecurity
industry as APT10.
The security firm told The Record in an interview earlier today that it couldn’t share the name
of the product exploited in the current attacks because of the ongoing law enforcement
investigation and because of the efforts to have a patch released and installed across the
local financial sector.
APT10 disguised intrusions behind credential stuffing attack
Instead, the company said that the attacks initially went undetected because they were
misclassified.
Investigations into the November 2021 attacks missed the part where hackers exploited the
software vulnerability and only saw a credential stuffing attack that APT10 used as a cover
and a way to get access to some trading accounts, which they used to execute large
transactions on the Hong Kong stock market.
But CyCraft researchers said that the credential stuffing attacks were only used as a cover.
In reality, APT10 exploited a vulnerability in the web interface of a security tool, planted a
version of the ASPXCSharp web shell, and then used a tool called Impacket to scan a target
company’s internal network.
The attackers then used a technique called reflective code loading to run malicious code on
local systems and install a version of the Quasar RAT that allowed the attackers persistent
remote access to the infected system using reverse RDP tunnels.
CyCraft said it was able to uncover the truth behind the November 2021 attacks after one of
its customers was hit in February 2022.
“Further investigation showed that what was initially presumed to be two separate waves of
cyberattacks was actually one prolonged attack campaign in which the attackers leveraged
advanced obfuscation techniques not previously observed,” the company told The Record
today.
“The objective of the attacks does not appear to have been financial gain but rather the
exfiltration of brokerage information, PII data, and the disruption of investment during a
period of economic growth for Taiwan,” it added.

The attacks are not surprising, as Chinese cyberespionage groups have had Taiwan in their
sights for years, having repeatedly and relentlessly attacked almost all sectors of its local
government and economy.
