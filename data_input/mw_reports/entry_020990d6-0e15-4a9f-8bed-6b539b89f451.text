(Beirut) – Hackers backed by the Iranian government have targeted two Human Rights
Watch staff members and at least 18 other high-profile activists, journalists, researchers,
academics, diplomats, and politicians working on Middle East issues in an ongoing social
engineering and credential phishing campaign, Human Rights Watch said today.
An investigation by Human Rights Watch attributed the phishing attack to an entity affiliated
with the Iranian government known as APT42 and sometimes referred to as Charming
Kitten. The technical analysis conducted jointly by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International’s Security Lab identified 18 additional victims who have been targeted as part of
the same campaign. The email and other sensitive data of at least three of them had been
compromised: a correspondent for a major US newspaper, a women’s rights defender based
in the Gulf region, and Nicholas Noe, an advocacy consultant for Refugees International
based in Lebanon.

“Iran’s state-backed hackers are aggressively using sophisticated social engineering and
credential harvesting tactics to access sensitive information and contacts held by Middle
East-focused researchers and civil society groups,” said Abir Ghattas, information security
director at Human Rights Watch. “This significantly increases the risks that journalists and
human rights defenders face in Iran and elsewhere in the region.”
For the three people whose accounts were known to be compromised, the attackers gained
access to their emails, cloud storage drives, calendars, and contacts and also performed a
Google Takeout, using a service that exports data from the core and additional services of a
Google account.
Various security companies have reported on phishing campaigns by APT42 targeting
Middle East-focused researchers, civil society groups, and dissidents. Most of them identify
APT42 based on targeting patterns and technical evidence. Organizations such as Google
and the cybersecurity companies Recorded Future, Proofpoint, and Mandiant have linked
APT 42 to Iranian authorities. Identifying and naming a threat actor helps researchers to
identify, track, and link hostile cyber activity.
In October 2022, a Human Rights Watch staff member working on the Middle East and North
Africa region received suspicious messages on WhatsApp from a person pretending to work
for a think tank based in Lebanon, inviting them to a conference. The joint investigation
revealed that the phishing links sent via WhatsApp, once clicked, directed the target to a fake
login page that captured the user’s email password and authentication code. The research
team investigated the infrastructure that hosted the malicious links and identified additional
targets of this ongoing campaign.
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International contacted the 18 high profile individuals
identified as targets of this campaign. Fifteen of them responded and confirmed that they had
received the same WhatsApp messages at some point between September 15 and
November 25, 2022.
On November 23, 2022, a second Human Rights Watch staff member was also targeted.
They received the same WhatsApp messages from the same number that contacted other
targets.
Social engineering and phishing attempts remain key components of Iranian cyberattacks.
Since 2010, Iranian operators have targeted members of foreign governments, militaries,
and businesses, as well as political dissidents and human rights defenders. Over time, these
attacks have become more sophisticated in the ways they execute what is known as “social
engineering.”
According to Mandiant, a US-based cybersecurity company, APT42 has been responsible for
several phishing attacks in Europe, the US, and the Middle East and North Africa region. On
September 14, 2022, the US Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Treasury Department

imposed sanctions on individuals affiliated with the group.
The investigation also revealed inadequacies in Google’s security protections to safeguard
its users’ data. Individuals successfully targeted by the phishing attack told Human Rights
Watch that they did not realize their Gmail accounts had been compromised or a Google
Takeout had been initiated, in part because the security warnings under Google’s account
activity do not push or display any permanent notification in a user’s inbox or send a push
message to the Gmail app on their phone.
Google’s security activity revealed that the attackers accessed the targets’ accounts almost
immediately after the compromise, and they maintained access to the accounts until the
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International research team informed them and assisted
them in removing the attacker’s connected device.
Google should promptly strengthen its Gmail account security warnings to better protect
journalists, human rights defenders, and its most at-risk users from attacks, Human Rights
Watch said.
“In a Middle East region rife with surveillance threats for activists, it's essential for digital
security researchers to not only publish and promote findings, but also prioritize the
protection of the region's embattled activists, journalists, and civil society leaders,” Ghattas
said.
Technical Analysis of the Phishing Campaign
On October 18, 2022, a Human Rights Watch staff member working on the Middle East and
North Africa region received a message on WhatsApp that claimed to be from a Lebanonbased think tank and invited the recipient to a conference. The invitation used the same
format as previous invitations from the think tank, indicating a sophisticated level of social
engineering. The person impersonated by the threat actor group APT42 in the WhatsApp
messages previously worked for the think tank.
The Human Rights Watch staff member forwarded these messages to the information
security team, which confirmed they were a phishing attempt. If the person had clicked on
the cutly[.]biz link, they would have been redirected to the URL
https://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/BI-File-2022.html which hosts a fake Microsoft login
page.

The cutly[.]biz domain is a custom URL shortener deployed and managed by the attacker’s
group, designed to mimic the name of the legitimate URL shortener cutt.ly.
The phishing link sent to the Human Rights Watch staff member included a random path of
five characters, both lowercase letters and numbers, which represents around 6 million
combinations, making it possible to enumerate all of the existing paths on the attacker’s
infrastructure to find other existing links. This enumeration led to the discovery of 44 valid
URLs, with many of them redirecting to a phishing page that displayed the email address of
the target. The phishing pages were specifically crafted to mimic Microsoft, Google, or Yahoo
login pages.

Further investigation showed that the phishing kit allowed the bypass of multi-factor
authentication methods other than a hardware security key. Multi-factor authentication (MFA),
often called two-factor authentication, or 2FA, requires a second means of authentication, in
addition to a password. Common second factors include a temporary code delivered by
SMS, a temporary code given by a smartphone application (such as FreeOTP or Google
Authenticator), and a code generated by a Hardware Security Key (like Yubikey or Solo Key).
Through different technical means, it is possible to create phishing toolkits that bypass MFA
when the temporary code is delivered by SMS or by a smartphone application. It is not
possible at present for a phishing kit to bypass multi-factor authentication using hardware
keys.
The WhatsApp chats of those who were known to be successfully targeted reveal that the
attackers were repeatedly engaging with the targets as they clicked through the phishing
links. After entering their credentials on the phishing page, targets were prompted to enter a
code on the 2FA bypass page, which the attackers used to gain access to their email
accounts. Phishing kits with MFA bypass features have been common since at least 2018,
and Amnesty International’s Security Lab has documented multiple usages of such kits
against human rights defenders in 2018 and 2020.

Targeting of Journalists and Human Rights Defenders by APT42
In addition to the two Human Rights Watch staff members, Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International identified 18 other email accounts targeted as part of the same
campaign, including six journalists.
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International contacted all of the individuals and 15
responded. They confirmed they were all targeted with the exact same social engineering
approach during the period between September 15 and November 25, 2022. Out of the 20
targets, at least three had been compromised by the threat actor. Confirming the
compromise led the research team to additional information about the data exfiltration
process. Human Rights Watch also supported the journalists by disconnecting the attackers
from their accounts and re-securing them.
The compromise gave the attackers access to the targets’ emails, cloud storage drives,
calendars, and contacts. In at least one case, the attacker synced the target’s mailbox and
performed a Google Takeout, a service that exports all of an account’s activity and
information including web searches, payments, travel and locations, ads clicked on, YouTube
activity, and additional account information. It is the most comprehensive and intrusive
method to export data in a Google account.

Google’s security activity revealed that the attackers had accessed the targets’ accounts
almost immediately after the compromise and that they had access for about five days until
Human Rights Watch informed the targets and helped remove the attacker’s connected
device.

Attribution
The Human Rights Watch Information Security team attributes these attacks with high
confidence to the Iranian threat actor APT42, also called TA453 by Proofpoint, Phosphorus
by Microsoft, and Charming Kitten by ClearSky and CERTFA based on specific technical
indicators linked to the phishing attacks and operational infrastructure used by the attackers
when accessing compromised accounts. The list of APT42’s targets that Human Rights
Watch identified all relate to the Middle East, including Iran, and one compromised account
was accessed by an IP address based in Tehran (see the technical details sections).Several
organizations have confirmed this attribution based on their own research into related
campaigns.
Many organizations, such as Google, and the cybersecurity companies Recorded Future and
Proofpoint, who have investigated APT42 attacks, have concluded that APT42 operates on
behalf of Iranian authorities. In September, the American cybersecurity company, Mandiant,
attributed APT42’s activities to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The source code of the phishing page used against the 20 targets includes JavaScript code
that is very similar to code that was used on a phishing page hosted on the domain mailerdaemon[.]net in November 2022, which was part of a phishing campaign attributed by

Recorded Future to the Iranian threat actor APT42. The same code was also found on
continuetogo[.]me in August 2021, which was part of a phishing campaign attributed by
Google to Iranian government-backed threat actors.

The second Human Rights Watch staff member who was targeted on November 23, 2022,
received the same WhatsApp messages from the same number that contacted other targets.
The malicious link shared with the staff was hosted on mailer-daemon[.]org and the attackers
used the same URL shortener (cutly[.]biz) to hide the full name of the domain.
The use of fake, uncommon, or custom URL shorteners was also seen in attacks attributed
to other Iranian threat actors such as Phosphorus against Israeli and US targets in June
2022, for which they used litby[.]us.
The investigation of the attacker’s infrastructure showed that the same group registered the
domain uani[.]us, a typo-squatted domain that copies an advocacy group based in the United
States called United Against Nuclear Iran, which was targeted by Charming Kitten in
November 2021.
All of the IP addresses used to connect to the compromised accounts were from the Express
VPN (Virtual Private Network) service. Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch found one Iranian
IP address, 5.160.239.XXX, that connected to one of the target’s inboxes. This could
potentially be the public IP address of the attacker’s own network, perhaps revealed after
they forgot to enable their VPN before connecting.

One of the most notable characteristics of Iranian government-backed threat groups is their
highly targeted spear-phishing, social engineering techniques, and impersonation of
conference and summit organizers to build trust and rapport with their targets. In this attack,
APT42 used the Lebanon-based think tank to trick their targets. The organizers of the
Munich Security Conference and Think 20 (T20) Summit in Saudi Arabia have been
impersonated in similar ways.
The recent Mandiant report on APT42 has provided more detailed information into the
difference and links between the APT35 and APT42 groups, both of which Mandiant
attributes to Iran’s IRGC. The CERTFA, for instance, has reattributed a campaign to APT42
instead of APT35 after this publication.
Technical Details on Post-Compromise Action and Indicators of Compromise
During the investigation, Human Rights Watch supported journalists and human rights
defenders who were compromised by this phishing campaign. This gave Human Rights
Watch insight into the attackers’ post-compromise actions.
In at least one case, the attackers performed a Google Takeout request, a service that
exports all of an account’s activity and information, including web searches, payments, travel
and locations, ads clicked on, YouTube activity, and additional account information. It is the
10/13

most comprehensive and intrusive method to export data in a Google account. The use of
Google Takeout to extract data from a compromised account is in line with the features of the
HYPERSCRAPE tool identified by the Google TAG team, although Human Rights Watch
could not confirm if the tool was used based on logs to which it had access.
For several targets, the attacker synchronized the compromised mailbox to a Microsoft
service in order to export the contents of the mailbox. As far as we know, it is the first time
that this behavior is reported as a post-compromise tactic used by APT42.

Google’s security activity revealed that the attackers accessed the targets’ accounts almost
immediately after the compromise, and that they maintained access until we informed the
targets and assisted them to remove the attacker’s connected device.
Based on Google Security logs, we identified the IP addresses used to connect to a
compromised account.
We observed the same computer name connected to all of the compromised accounts:
DESKTOP-F8QNCC0.
