CrowdStrike® Intelligence™ has been researching reports of widespread DNS hijacking
activity since information on the attacks became publicly available earlier this month.1 The
information allowed for the discovery of at least a subset of domains affected by this
campaign. CrowdStrike can confirm that numerous organizations in sectors such as
government, insurance, and civilian aviation, as well as internet service providers (ISPs)
and infrastructure providers, were affected going back as far as February 2017.
The ultimate objective of this activity is currently unclear. However, DNS hijacking attacks
would allow the responsible actors to capture the contents of web traffic to affected
domains, during the time periods in which they were hijacked, and potentially use the
captured data in follow-on operations. Given current information, CrowdStrike is unable to
make adversary or country-level attribution of this activity.

Malicious Infrastructure and Identified Targets

1/7

Based on available information, CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence team has been able to
identify 28 organizations in 12 different countries whose domains were hijacked. The
organizations affected were primarily located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
region, but there was also a limited number of affected entities in Europe and the United
States.

Actor-owned Domains Used as Name

Once hijacked, targeted domains ceased resolving to their normal IP addresses and began
resolving to actor-controlled infrastructure. The actors would also create certificates for the
domains, primarily through Let’s Encrypt, a certificate authority that provides free X.509
certificates for TLS encryption. This would allow visitors to continue to establish trusted
connections, despite the fact that they were pointing at malicious infrastructure. Available
data shows that most affected domains were hijacked for very short periods of time,
sometimes a day or less, with one domain showing resolutions to a malicious IP address for
over a month.

Internet Infrastructure Providers Affected
Particularly notable are a small number of domains owned by significant ISPs or
infrastructure providers. The affected ISP domains belonged to a private entity appearing to
provide services to a wide range of customers in all sectors, while another affected entity
provided services to government, research and academic organizations within its own
country.
Two other affected organizations operate core functions of the internet globally, such as
internet exchange points, root DNS servers and numerous top-level domains (TLDs). A
compromise of internet infrastructure operators such as these could support data collection
against a wide range of organizations.

Assessment
While the precise objectives behind this DNS hijacking activity are unclear, this tactic could
be used by malicious actors to support a number of missions:
Direct collection of data from web traffic to affected domains
Collection of credentials from captured traffic for use in obtaining access to networks
of future targets
Delivery of malware from actor-owned infrastructure
This activity was likely meant to support intelligence collection operations against the
entities whose domains were hijacked and possibly associated organizations likely to visit
those sites. In addition, the activity targeting the ISPs and infrastructure providers could
potentially have supported information collection against a range of currently unidentified
targets.

4/7

Public reporting has indicated there are factors that point to a possible Iranian nexus for this
activity. While the CrowdStrike Intelligence team agrees that the heavy focus on affected
Middle Eastern governments would support the traditional intelligence collection interests of
Iran, there is currently not enough information to make any definitive assessment around
country or adversary-level attribution at this time.
Finally, it should be noted that given current information, it is unclear if this hijacking activity
is linked to one or multiple actors. Considering the extended period of time over which this
activity took place and the variance in malicious infrastructure, it is possible that multiple
entities were involved in carrying out this DNS hijacking.
