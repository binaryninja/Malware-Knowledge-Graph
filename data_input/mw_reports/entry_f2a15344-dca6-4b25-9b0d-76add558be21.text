May 3, 2017

On April 27, 2017 The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)
released an alert TA17-117A [1] with information on an emerging sophisticated campaign. The
campaign has been active since at least May 2016 and targets organization in several sectors,
including Information Technology, Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Communications and
Critical Manufacturing. The threat actors have deployed multiple malware families and variants in
their campaign including PlugX and RedLeaves.
This threat advisory discusses the host and network behavior of RedLeaves malware. In addition,
it shows how to leverage the Hunting pack to detect RedLeaves network activity using RSA
NetWitness Logs and Packets.
A typical infection scenario starts with a dropper dropping a legitimate application (EXE), a
malicious DLL, and an encoded DATA file in the user %TMP% folder [2].
The screenshot below shows the files dropped by a RedLeaves sample on a victim machine [3]:

Filename

obedience.exe

StarBurn.dll

handkerchief.dat

773b176b3a68c3d21fae907af8fba7908b55726bd591c5335c8c0bc9de179b76

It then starts the application. Taking advantage of DLL preloading, the EXE file loads the
malicious DLL, which reads, decodes, and then executes the DATA file. It then creates a new
process and injects itself into it. Below is a snapshot of the process tree after running the same
sample on hybrid-analysis.com [4]:

To ensure that one instance of the malware is running on an infected system, the malware
creates a mutant. In this case, it is vv11287GD. To gain persistency on the system, the malware
creates a link in the Startup folder pointing to the legitimate application dropped in the %TEMP%
folder.
The malware starts beaconing to its C2 server using raw TCP over port 443 as follows:

As explained in the alert issued by US-CERT, the payload follows two 12-bytes fixed length
headers. The first header comes in its own packet, the second header and the payload in a
separate packet in the same TCP stream. The first four bytes of the second header (0x3275636b)
represent the length of the encrypted and compressed payload (XOR encoded with the first four
bytes of the RC4 key), the second four bytes of the second header (0x3175636b) represent the
length of the decrypted and decompressed payload (XOR encoded with the first four bytes of the
RC4 key).
Analyzing the strings in the address space of the injected process; in this case iexplore.exe;
suggests that the RC4 key is Lucky123 with null byte appended:

Here is the decrypted payload:

The malware also sends the same payload along with the second header to the server as an
HTTP POST request over port 443:

A list of commands supported by RedLeaves can be found in the report released by the NCC
Group Cyber Defence Operations team [5].

Detection using Hunting Pack
The Hunting pack is designed to allow you to quickly hunt for indicators of compromise or
anomalous network activity by dissecting packet traffic within the NetWitness Suite and
populating specific meta keys with natural language values for investigation. For more information
on the hunting pack including how to deploy it in your environment, please refer to RSA
documentation [6].
The screenshot below shows some of the meta keys registered by the hunting pack for the initial
RedLeaves beaconing session. That is the one using a raw TCP connection over port 443:

The session was tagged with different meta values indicating suspicious traffic over SSL port.
Here is a description of some of those values:
Meta Value

Description

session size 0-5k
A total session size, request + response payload, between 0KB and
5KB

ratio high
transmitted

Between 75% and 100% of the session payload transmitted outbound

potential beacon
Session assumed to be programmatic, nefarious communications

not top 20 dst
org.dst is not one of the most common 20 destinations

4/6

Meta Value

Description

first carve
outbound traffic with two streams and payload > 0

first carve not dns

outbound traffic with two streams and payload > 0 and not service type
53

The screenshot below shows some of the meta keys registered by the hunting pack for the
following RedLeaves beaconing sessions. Those are the ones that use HTTP POST requests
over port 443:

The sessions were tagged with different meta values indicating suspicious HTTP traffic over SSL
port. Here is a description of some of those values:
Meta Value

Description

watchlist file extension

Any executable extension commonly used with malware like
.exe, .php, .zip, etc

http with binary

HTTP with binary data in the body

http suspicious 4 headers

Sessions with only HTTP POST and four HTTP headers

host-header contains port

Host header directly declares a port such as
'www.example.com:80'

http post no get low header
count not flash

An HTTP POST request with less than 6 Headers and the useragent is not ‘shockwave flash’

http post no get no referrer
directtoip

HTTP session with at least one POST request to an IP address,
no GET requests, and no referer

While the network behavior explained earlier is not unique to RedLeaves malware, the hunting
pack can help an analyst in identifying suspicious traffic in the environment without relying on any
network signatures.
