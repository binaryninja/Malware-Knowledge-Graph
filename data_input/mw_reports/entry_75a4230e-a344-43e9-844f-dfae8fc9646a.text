A new remote access trojan (RAT) named Borat has appeared on darknet markets, offering
easy-to-use features to conduct DDoS attacks, UAC bypass, and ransomware deployment.
As a RAT, Borat enables remote threat actors to take complete control of their victim’s mouse
and keyboard, access files, network points, and hide any signs of their presence.
The malware lets its operators choose their compilation options to create small payloads that
feature precisely what they need for highly tailored attacks.
Borat was analyzed by researchers at Cyble, who spotted it in the wild and sampled the
malware for a technical study that revealed its functionality.

Some of Borat's features (Cyble)

Extensive features
It is unclear if the Borat RAT is sold or freely shared among cybercriminals, but Cycle says it
comes in the form of a package that includes a builder, the malware’s modules, and a server
certificate.

Files in

the Borat RAT archive (Cyble)
The features of the trojan, each having its own dedicated module, include the following:
Keylogging – monitor and log key presses and store them in a txt file
Ransomware – deploy ransomware payloads onto the victim’s machine and
automatically generate a ransom note through Borat
DDoS – direct garbage traffic to a target server by using the compromised machine’s
resources
Audio recording – record audio via the microphone, if available, and store it in a wav
file

Webcam recording – record video from the webcam, if available
Remote desktop – start a hidden remote desktop to perform file operations, use input
devices, execute code, launch apps, etc.
Reverse proxy – set up a reverse proxy to protect the remote operator from having
their identity exposed
Device info – gather basic system information
Process hollowing – inject malware code into legitimate processes to evade detection
Credential stealing – steal account credentials stored in Chromium-based web
browsers
Discord token stealing – steal Discord tokens from the victim
Other functions – disrupt and confuse the victim by playing audio, swapping the
mouse buttons, hiding the desktop, hiding the taskbar, holding the mouse, turning off
the monitor, showing a blank screen, or hanging the system

More of Borat's advertised features (Cyble)
As noted in Cyble’s analysis, the above features make Borat essentially a RAT, spyware, and
ransomware, so it’s a potent threat that could conduct a variety of malicious activity on a
device.
All in all, even though the RAT's developer decided to name it after the main character of the
comedy movie Borat, incarnated by Sacha Baron Cohen, the malware is no joke at all.
By digging deeper trying to find the origin of this malware, Bleeping Computer found that the
payload executable was recently identified as AsyncRAT, so it's likely that its author based
his work on it.
Typically, threat actors distribute these tools via laced executables or files that masquerade
as cracks for games and applications, so be careful not to download anything from
untrustworthy sources such as torrents or shady sites.
