Methods Used to Spread Infection

Patterns of spreading infection
• Exploiting vulnerabilities (MS14-068 +
MS14-058)
• Investigating SYSVOL scripts
• Password list-based attack
• Exploiting Built-in Administrator
password
• Setting malware in file servers
• Exploiting WPAD
• Others
22

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

Exploiting Vulnerabilities (MS14-068 + MS14-058)
1. Escalate privilege (MS14-058) and
dump user’s password with mimikatz
2. Exploit MS14-068 vulnerability and
gain Domain Admin privileges

PC-A

3. Upload mimikatz to DC and dump
admin’s passwords

Domain
Controller

6. Malware executes
according to the task
4. Copy malware to PC-B

5. Register a task in order to execute malware
23

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

PC-B

Investigating SYSVOL Scripts
Key Point
• In some cases, passwords are found in logon script,
etc.

Attacker’s
Infrastructure

Domain
Controller

6. Malware executes
according to the task

3. Search admin’s
password

4. Copy malware to
PC-B

2. Download

C2 Server
24

1. Download logon script,
compress and archive

PC-A

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

5. Register a task in order
to execute malware

PC-B

Password List-based Attack
Key Point
• Attempts logon by using an approximately 10-30 line password
list and the user’s list of Domain Admins
• Uses a tool called logon.exe (self-built?)

1. Get user’s list of
Domain Admins

2. Attempts logon
with logon.exe

PC-A
25

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

Domain
Controller

5. Execute
3. Copy malware

4. Register a task

PC-B

Exploiting Built-in Administrator Password
Key Point
• An effective measure when there is no way to
exploit Domain environment
• Need to hash passwords or dump passwords
1. Escalate privilege (UAC bypass)
and dump user’s password

5. Execute
4. Register a task

3. Copy malware

PC-A

2. Pass the hash or net use
net use ¥¥PC-B¥IPC$ [password] /u:Administrator

26

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

PC-B

Setting Malware in File Servers
Key Point

• Effective when there is no other measure
1. Replace the existing file
with malware disguised with
fake icons

File Server 2. Execute
malware in file
servers

PC-A
27

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

PC-B

Exploiting WPAD
WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery)
— Turned on by default
— Get automatic configuration script from either



28

URL specified by DHCP server, or
http://wpad/wpad.dat

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

Exploiting WPAD (Step 1: NetBIOS Spoofing)
Key Point
• Effective in an environment where WPAD is not
configured
• NetBIOS Spoofing

1. Broadcast: Name query NB WPAD

wpad.exe

PC-A
29

Copyright©2015 JPCERT/CC All rights reserved.

2. Name query response
(I am WPAD)

PC-B

Exploiting WPAD (Step 2: Fake WPAD Server)
wpad.dat (automatic configuration script)
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
if (myIpAddress() != “[PC-A addr]”) {
return ‘PROXY wpad:8888;DIRECT’;
}
return ‘DIRECT’;
}
3. Request http://wpad/wpad.dat

4. Response
wpad.exe
