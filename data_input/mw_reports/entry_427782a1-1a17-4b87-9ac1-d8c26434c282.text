Introduction
During a normal monitoring activity, one of the detection tools hits a suspicious email coming from
the validtree.com domain. The domain was protected by a Panama company to hide its real
registrant and this condition rang a warning bell on the suspected email so that it required a
manual analysis in order to investigate its attachment.
Digging into this malicious artifact opened up to a possible raising interest of the infamous TA505
in System Integrator Companies (companies in which have been found that threat).

Technical Analysis
During the past few weeks suspicious emails coming from the validtree.com domain was
detected: they were addressing System Integration Companies. The domain validtree.com is
registered through namecheap.com on 2017-12-07T15:55:27Z but recently renewed on 2019-1016T05:35:18Z. The registrant is protected by a Panama company named WhoisGuard which
hides the original registrant name. Currently the domain points to 95.211.151.230 which is an IP
address assigned to LeaseWeb a VPS hosting provider located in Netherland, Europe. Attached
to the email a suspicious word document was waiting to be opened from the victim.

By opening the word document the victim displays the following text (Image1). The document
tempts the victim in enabling the macro functionality in order to re-encode the document with
readable charsets by translating the current encoding charset to the local readable one.

Image1: Word Document Content

A transparent Microsoft-word-shape placed on top of the encoded text avoids the victim to
interact with the unreadable text. That document holds two VBA-Macro functions which were
identiﬁed as a romantic AutoOpen and an additional one named HeadrFooterProperty .
Interesting to note that the document had no evidences on VT (during the analysis time), so it
could be a revamped threat or a totally new one! The two Macros decoded a Javascript payload
acting as a drop and execute by using a well-known strategy as described in: “Frequent VBA
Macros used in Ofﬁce Malware”. The following image shows the decoding process. A ﬁrst round
of obfuscation technique was adopted by the attacker in order to make harder the analyst’s
decoding process. That stage implements an obfuscated Javascript embedded code which
decodes, by using a XOR with key=11 , a third Javascript stage acting as drop and execute on
66.133.129.5 resource. That IP is assigned to Frontier Communications Solutions: a NY
based company.

It was nice to read the obfuscated code since the variable names where actually thematically
chosen per function. For example the theseus function is obfuscated with “divine terms”, one of
my favorite was actually the following conditional branch: If pastorale / quetzalcoatl <

Then

... , which actually was always true ! ( quetzalcoatl is “feathered serpent” a

aztech god, while pastorale is an evocative composition often used for cite or pray to gods).

Another fun fact was in the variable name the attacker attributed to the string “JavaScript”:
emotionless. In particular the attacker refers to JavaScript through the object
“ emotionless.Language ”. Funny isn’t it ?
The ﬁnal javascript downloader aims to drop a ﬁle from
http://66[.133[.129[.5/~chuckgilbert/09u8h76f/65fg67n placing it into the system
temporary directory and naming it nanagrams.exe . Finally it runs that windows PE ﬁle on the
victim machine.
During the analysis-time the dropping URL was not working, indeed the dropping URL contains a
surprise.php . Actually, a misconﬁguration of the dropping website allowed us to visualize its
source code. As shown in the following image (Image3) the page tracks the visitors through an
iframe pointing to: http[://tehnofaq[.work and through a random loop redirects the
downloader script to a different dropping URL.

Image3: Redirecting script

Building a re-directors or proxy chains is quite useful for attackers in order to evade Intrusion
Prevention Systems and/or protections infrastructures based upon IPs or DNS blocks. In such a
case the redirection script pushes to one of the following domains by introducing the HTML meta
“refresh” tag, pointing the browser URL to a random choice between 4 different entries belonging
to the following two domains:
http[://com-kl96.net
http[://com-mk84.net

Possible Link with TA-505
The used infrastructure, by analyzing the dropping urls, looks like an old infrastructure used for
propagating Ransomware. Indeed it’s possible to observe many analogies with the following
dropping urls belonging to a previously utilized Ransomware threat:
http[://66.133.129.5/~kvas/
http[://66.133.129.5/~nsmarc1166/
http[://frontiernet.net/~jherbaugh/

The infrastructure used in the attacks suggests the involvement of the cybercrime group TA505.
The TA505 group, that is known to have operated both theDridex and Lockymalware families,
continues to make small changes to its operations. TA505 hacking group has been active since
2014 focusing on Retail and banking sectors.
Recently security experts at Proofpoint observed the notorious TA505 cybercrime group that has
been using a new RAT dubbed SDBbot, it is a backdoor that is delivered via a new downloader

dubbed Get2 that was written in C++. The dropper was also used to distribute other payloads,
including FlawedGrace, FlawedAmmyy, and Snatch. The used URLs in the attack have the same
pattern associated with the notorious crime gang, the researchers also pointed out that the IP
addresses (i.e. 66.133.129.5) observed in the attacks were involved in previous campaigns
delivering Locky and Dridex malware.

Unfortunately, I was not able to analyse the ﬁnal payload of the attack chain that was still not
available at the time of the analysis. The ﬁnal stage malware analysis is essential to attempt
to attribute the attack to a speciﬁc threat actor. The evidence and artifacts collected in this
analysis suggest two possible scenarios:
TA505 group is expanding his operations, but it still controlling an infrastructure involved in
previous attacks across the years. The threat actors still leverage this infrastructure for “hit
and run” operations or to test new attacks technique and tools avoiding to expose their
actual infrastructure. Both options are interesting, but only the knowledge of the ﬁnal
stage malware could give us a wider view on the current operations of the group.
Another threat actor, likely ﬁnancially motivated, is leveraging the same infrastructure used
by TA505 and used it to make it harder the analysis and the attribution of the attacks.

Conclusion
An interesting Maldoc acting as drop-and-execute was identiﬁed and spotted in the wild targeting
System Integrator based in Europe . From the described analysis we attempted to identify the
attacker by observing he was exploiting an old infrastructure behind 66.133.129.5 as a
dropping websites.
During the analysis time the attack-path was still incomplete and the attacker didn’t weaponize
the dropping websites yet, but the spread document is able to grab content from speciﬁc URLs
and to run directly on the victim machine.
The used strings for obfuscating the dropper were actually fun and “thematic”. For example
strings like “madrillus”, “vulcano”, “pastorale”, “quetzalcoatl” remind an ancient culture (mandrillus,
vulcano and quetzalcoatl) while objects like “emotionless” assigned to a speciﬁc programming
language reminds a witty attacker.
Since no ﬁnal stage was obtained so far, attribution is quite hard, but TTPs suggest a TA-505
attacker, due to the collected artifacts and to the analyzed URLs.
