CYBER SECURITY INCIDENTS FROM THE NÚKIB’S
PERSPECTIVE

APRIL 2022

National
Cyber and Information
Security Agency

Summary of the month
April was a month with the second highest
number of incidents in the last twelve
months. Compared to the previous
months, the number of organisations that
notified NÚKIB about an incident has
grown by one-fifth.
The growth in the number of incidents was
mainly caused by a campaign led by a proRussian hacktivist group known as Killnet.
NÚKIB was notified about associated cyber
incidents by seven organisations. The attacks were generally less sophisticated,
causing the unavailability of web pages.
The group did not compromise the information systems of their targets and hence
did not access the data stored in them. It is
likely that Killnet’s motivation was to harm
the reputation of its targets.

The attacks are likely to be associated with
the Czech Republic’s support to Ukraine.
Killnet is a Russian-speaking group and
based on its statements, supports the Russian Federation. Since the beginning of the
invasion, the group has attacked not only
organisations and governmental institutions in the Czech Republic but also other
NATO states and Ukraine. The DDoS attacks
in partner states coincided with important
events, typically military or humanitarian
support to Ukraine. The attacks in the
Czech Republic were no exception in this
regard.

The following report summarises the events of the month. The data, information and conclusions contained herein are
primarily based on cyber incidents reported to NÚKIB. Where the report contains information from open sources in
some sections, the source of this information is always stated.

Classification of the incidents reported to NÚKIB3
NÚKIB classified April’s incidents within the following four categories:
o

Three-quarters of all the incidents resulted in the unavailability of services. Seven of these incidents were
caused by DDoS attacks, which had only represented a minor part of the incidents reported to NÚKIB in the
preceding months. Ransomware and cryptomining malware had adverse effects on availability in five cases; in
three incidents, the service unavailability was caused by a technical failure;

o

The second most frequent category included incidents with unauthorised access to information. One of them
was an attack against a local authority’s database, whose content the attackers stole. The attackers have not
published the data so far; nevertheless, its publishing cannot be ruled out in the near future;

o

NÚKIB classified one attack as fraud. The attackers probably compromised an e-mail account of an important
state institution’s employee. subsequently, they sent phishing e-mails with diplomatic theme from the e-mail
account to governmental organisations in other European countries (see page 4);

o

The last remaining April’s incident was classified by NÚKIB within the malicious code category after NÚKIB had
found elements of a Czech company’s infrastructure communicating with Emotet malware control servers.

April trends in cyber security from the NÚKIB’s perspective4
Phishing, spear-phishing, and social engineering

Malware

One of April’s incidents involved an intercepted
phishing e-mail that the attackers were sending from
an infected e-mail of a state organisation’s employee.
The phishing had diplomatic theme and was sent from
the Czech e-mail address to another nearly 200
addresses of governmental organisations in European
countries.

Within the scope of its pro-active activities (known as
threat hunting), NÚKIB uncovered an infrastructure of
a Czech company hat communicated with Emotet C2
server. Attackers deploy Emotet as a first stage payload,
which is often spread by phishing. Upon compromising
the victim’s network, Emotet downloads other malware.
Emotet is currently active in the Czech Republic. Since
last autumn, when Emotet re-appeared on the
cybersecurity scene, NÚKIB has been finding Czech
companies infected with this malware.

As fraudulent vishing phone calls continue, NÚKIB
drew attention to this campaign again. The alert on our
website lists features typical for this wave.

Vulnerabilities

Ransomware

In April, a new critical vulnerability of VMware
Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager (CVE2022-22954) products appeared. This vulnerability
enables an attacker to bypass authentication
mechanisms and remotely upload a malicious code
onto a server. Since attackers instantly started to
exploit the vulnerability, NÚKIB warned the regulated
subjects with vulnerable systems about the problem
and sent them recommendations regarding its
mitigation.

Since the beginning of the year, ransomware attacks
have constantly amounted to approximately one-fifth of
the incidents registered by NÚKIB. This trend continued
in April. The Phobos ransomware was behind the
majority of attacks. Phobos primarily aims at smaller and
more vulnerable targets. It regularly appears among the
incidents reported to NÚKIB. One of April’s incidents also
involved LokiLocker, which is quite a new ransomware
offered as a service; it started to spread in the summer of
2021, and this was its second occurrence reported to
NÚKIB so far.

Attacks on availability
In the last twelve months, DDoS attacks had only represented a minor part of the incidents registered by
NÚKIB. The situation changed in April, though. More
than one-third of the incidents were caused by DDoS
attacks launched against Czech targets by Killnet,
a pro-Russian hacker group (for more information, see
page 6). In some cases, DDoS attacks took down web
pages for several hours. NÚKIB was notified about such
incidents by seven organisations regulated under the
Cyber Security Act; however, the actual number of Killnet’s Czech victims was approximately three times
higher.

Technique of the month: Malicious File
NÚKIB also evaluates cyber incidents on the basis of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which serves
as an overview of known techniques and tactics used in cyber attacks. The prevailing method among
April’s incidents was Malicious File, which is a method employed by most APT and cybercriminal
groups in their campaigns and which is a common part of phishing attacks.
With Malicious File, attackers rely on a user to open a file and run the malicious code. This
method is typical for spear-phishing e-mails, for example, which try to persuade the user
to open an infected attachment and thereby launch the malicious code hidden in it. Among
April’s incidents, the Malicious File method was most often reported in connection with
phishing. The attackers used the method in the initial stages of cyberattacks; however, it
can also be used later when the attackers are already present in the victim’s network. After
compromising the network, they can create a file, save it on a shared disc and wait until
other users open it and enable them lateral movement.

MITRE ID: T1204.002

Mitigation: The T1204.002 technique can be mitigated at two levels. At the technical level,
sandboxing of attachments, at least in the case of potentially problematic file types (zip,
exe, ps1, and js) and warning users about password-protected archives are suitable
measures. The most frequently abused method in connection with malicious attachments
is still macros in Office documents. At the level of technical measures, this attack vector
can be most easily prevented via domain policies by blocking macro functions for users that
do not need them for their work. Yet technical measures alone are not enough. It is essential to train users continuously and draw their attention to the risks associated with social
engineering and the latest trends in phishing so that they are able to detect them themselves.

Focus on a threat: DDoS campaign launched by Killnet
In the second half of April, a pro-Russian hacker group known as Killnet launched two series of DDoS
attacks against webpages of Czech subjects. The attacks are likely connected to the Czech Republic’s
support to Ukraine.
Fig. 1: Killnet’s telegram account

The first wave occurred between 19 and 21 April and affected thirteen subjects, including NÚKIB and Czech Ministries. The beginning
of the attacks coincided with the announcement of Ukrainian
heavy weaponry being repaired in the Czech Republic. The second
wave took place in the night of 27 April, when the attackers
launched attacks against another nine subjects. Killnet announced
the initiation of the attacks against Czech organisations on its Telegram account (see Figure 1).
The attacks were generally less sophisticated, causing the unavailability of web pages. In principle, DDoS attacks overwhelm a service accessible via the Internet with a flood of traffic but do not
compromise the organisation’s information systems. Consequently, Killnet did not get to the data stored in the attacked organisations. Its goal probably was to harm the reputation of the
attacked organisations.
Technical aspects of the attacks by Killnet
Based on data from one of the incidents, NÚKIB identified the attacks as L4 TCP ACK DDoS. It is an
attack on the transport layer that employs TCP ACK or TCP ACK-PUSH segments, which are used to
confirm received data in legitimate communication. This sort of attack is more difficult to mitigate
since it is not easy to distinguish legitimate ACK packets from the malicious ones. As a result, the
computational power of the infrastructure’s server or firewall is exhausted due to the heavy traffic
of forged communication.

Killnet is a Russian-speaking group that, based on its statements, supports the Russian Federation.
This affects its choice of targets. Besides those in the Czech Republic, the group has also attacked
organisations and governmental institutions in other NATO states and Ukraine. But for one case, all
the attacks were of the DDoS type. An exception was an alleged theft of the Kyiv prosecutor’s data,
which coincided with the discovery of the Bucha massacre.5 Bucha falls under the jurisdiction of the
prosecution office in the capital of Ukraine. Like in the Czech Republic, the DDoS attacks in other
states also coincided with important events, typically military or humanitarian support to Ukraine.
NÚKIB has been pointing out the increased risk of cyberattacks since the beginning of the Russian
aggression. On 25 February, NÚKIB issued a Warning, which, among others, contains a whole range
of preventive and reactive measures against DDoS attacks. Since the Ukrainian war is very likely to
continue affecting the Czech Republic in cyberspace, we draw attention to the Warning again and
recommend all organisations to implement the mentioned measures. The document provides
a guide on how to prepare for a potential DDoS attack and mitigate one that has already occurred.
