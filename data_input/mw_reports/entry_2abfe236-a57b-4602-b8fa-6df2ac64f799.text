Following the revelation of four zero-day vulnerabilities currently affecting Microsoft
Exchange Server, Check Point Research (CPR) discloses its latest observations on
exploitation attempts against organizations that it tracks worldwide.

CPR has seen thousands of exploit attempts against organizations worldwide
CPR has observed that the number of attempted attacks have increased tenfold
from 700 on March 11 to over 7,200 on March 15.
The country most attacked has been The United States (17% of all exploit
attempts), followed by Germany (6%), the United Kingdom (5%), The
Netherlands (5%) and Russia (4%).
Most targeted industry sector has been Government/Military (23% of all exploit
attempts), followed by Manufacturing (15%), Banking & Financial Services
(14%), Software vendors (7%) and Healthcare (6%).
Since the recently disclosed vulnerabilities on Microsoft Exchange Servers, a full race has
started amongst hackers and security professionals. Global experts are using massive
preventative efforts to combat hackers who are working day-in and day-out to produce an
exploit that can successfully leverage the remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Exchange.
CPR has outlined the disclosed vulnerabilities, the targeted organizations by country and
industry, and then recommendations to prevent the attacks, which are yet to come.

Behind-the-scenes of the Zero Days
On March 3, 2021 Microsoft released an emergency patch for its Exchange Server product,
the most popular mail server worldwide. All incoming and outgoing emails, calendar
invitations and virtually anything accessed within Outlook goes through the Exchange
server.
Orange Tsai (Cheng-Da Tsai) from DEVCORE, a security firm based in Taiwan, reported
two vulnerabilities in January. Unware of the full magnitude of these findings, Microsoft was
prompted to further investigate their Exchange server. The investigation uncovered five
more critical vulnerabilities.
The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read emails from an Exchange server without
authentication or accessing an individual’s email account. Further vulnerability chaining
enables attackers to completely take over the mail server itself.
Once an attacker takes over the Exchange server, they can open the network to the internet
and access it remotely. As many Exchange servers have internet exposer (specifically
Outlook Web Access feature) and are integrated within the broader network, this poses a
critical security risk for millions of organizations.

What organizations are at risk?
If your organization’s Microsoft Exchange server is exposed to the internet, and has not
been updated with the latest patches nor protected by a third party software such as Check
Point, then you should assume the server is completely compromised. Compromised
servers could enable an unauthorized attacker to extract your corporate emails and execute
malicious code inside your organization with high privileges.

Technical Explanation
CVE-2021-26855 – is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange
which allows the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the
Exchange server.
CVE-2021-26857 – is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified
Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data
is desterilized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gives HAFNIUM the ability to
run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission
or another vulnerability to exploit.
CVE-2021-26858 – is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in
Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could
use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate
by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate
admin’s credentials.
CVE-2021-27065 – is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in
Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could
use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate
by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate
admin’s credentials.
Since the disclosure, CPR has received questions regarding the identity of the attackers,
their motivation and the wide context of recent major hacks.
In this attack, as in Sunburst, a particularly common platform was used as a front door for
covert entry and prolonged stay within the network. The good news is that only highly
skilled and well-financed threat actors are capable of using the front door to potentially enter
tens of thousands of organizations worldwide. While hacking the exchange server with zero
days is quite impressive, the purpose of the attack and what cybercriminals wanted within
the network is still unknown. Organizations who are at risk should not only take preventive
actions on their Exchange, but also scan their networks for live threats and assess all
assets.
Prevent Future Attacks and Remain Protected
Here are Check Point’s recommendations to prevent future attacks and remain protected:
Patch – immediately update all Microsoft Exchange Servers to the latest patched
versions available by Microsoft. This update is not automatic and you are expected to
perform it manually.
Threat Prevention protections – Check Point provides comprehensive security
coverage to the vulnerabilities reported by Microsoft with the following Threat
Prevention protections:
