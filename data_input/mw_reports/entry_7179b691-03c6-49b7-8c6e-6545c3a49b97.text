Keep up to date with latest blog posts
As we all observed, the number of ransomware attacks increased dramatically in 2021.
Since late 2020, the Ranzy Locker ransomware has been responsible for dozens of highprofile breaches. Essentially, Ranzy is a rebranded and improved version of the ThunderX
ransomware. Since a free decryption tool of ThunderX is released, Ranzy Locker has been
released by the threat actors. Note that the Tor onion URL used by Ranzy was the same as
the one previously used by the Ako ransomware. So, it is also a successor of Ako.
Ranzy threat actors also have established a Ransomware as a Service (RAAS) model and
utilize the double extortion tactic. In other words, they exfiltrate critical data before encrypting
files and threaten the victim with the release of the exfiltrated data to encourage ransom
payment.
According to the flash report of the FBI, the Ranzy Locker ransomware gang had
compromised over 30 businesses in the U.S. alone as of July 2021. Victims of ransomware
are in various sectors, such as manufacturing, government, transformation, and IT.

We provide the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Ranzy Locker threat
actors in this blog post because detecting and blocking a threat's TTPs is the most effective
method of preventing that threat. TTPs enable us to identify potential intrusions and analyze
the behavior of threat actors.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by Ranzy Locker
Ransomware
This section presents the malicious behaviors of the Ranzy Locker ransomware group. Our
analysis uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CKÂ®) version 10 framework. See the ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise v10 for all
referenced tactics and techniques.

1. Initial Access
The Initial Access tactic includes techniques used by attackers to gain an initial foothold
within a network, such as exploiting vulnerabilities on public-facing web servers.
1.1. ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application
Ranzy Locker operators leverage known Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities to
compromise target systems.
1.2. ATT&CK T1566 Phishing
The Ranzy Locker ransomware is also distributed via phishing campaigns.
1.3. ATT&CK T1078 Valid Accounts
The ransomware gang leverages valid accounts with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to
access target systems.

2. Execution
This tactic includes techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or
remote system. The execution technique cannot be detached from other techniques; it is
often paired with techniques from all other tactics.
2.1. MITRE ATT&CK T1106 Native API
Adversaries can execute behaviors directly through the native OS application programming
interface (API). The Ranzy Locker ransomware leverages Windows API for a variety of
operations, such as enumerating shared resources, as explained below.

3. Defense Evasion
2/8

Defense evasion techniques are used by adversaries to avoid detection by security controls.

3.1. ATT&CK T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information
The Ranzy Locker ransomware uses Base64 encoding to obfuscate its configuration in the
ransom note.
3.2. ATT&CK T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
Adversaries may use a variety of techniques to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis
environments. This may include altering behavior in response to the detection of artifacts
indicative of a virtual machine (VM) environment or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VM
environment, they may modify their malware in order to disengage from the victim or conceal
the implant's core functions. The Ranzy locker ransomware group uses IsDebuggerPresent
API call to detect debuggers by checking if a program is running in debugging mode.

4. Credential Access
4.1. ATT&CK T1110 Brute Force
The ransomware gang acquires valid accounts through brute force.

5. Discovery
Adversaries use the techniques in the Discovery tactic to obtain information about the target
environment, such as services, processes, network, files, software, system, accounts,
domain, and registry.
5.1. ATT&CK T1083 File and Directory Discovery
The Ranzy Locker ransomware discovers critical files to exfiltrate, such as customer data,
personally identifiable information (PII) files, and financial records. It uses GetLogicalDrives
API call to enumerate all mounted drives, as also used by the Ryuk ransomware.

5.2. ATT&CK T1135 Network Share Discovery
Ranzi utilizes NetShareEnum API call for discovering shared resources, such as SMB
network shares, to encrypt files stored in these resources. This API call is also used by the
Conti ransomware. It also sends ARP broadcast requests for network device lookup.
5.3. ATT&CK T1057 Process Discovery
Adversaries get information about running processes to understand software and
applications running on the system and shape follow-on behaviors. Ranzy uses Windows
Native API calls to enumerate running processes.
5.4. ATT&CK T1120 Peripheral Device Discovery
3/8

The Ranzy Locker ransomware scans all drive letters to infect USB drives.
5.5. ATT&CK T1018 Remote System Discovery
Ranzy reads the host file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) to discover the hostname
to IP address mappings of remote systems.
5.6. T1082 System Information Discovery
The ransomware queries the volume information to determine the disks in the system.

6. Impact
The Impact tactic covers techniques that manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems to
disrupt availability, compromise integrity, or cover a confidentiality breach.
6.1. ATT&CK T1490 Inhibit System Recovery
Ranzy Locker ransomware attacks utilize multiple procedures to inhibit system recovery:
First, it disables shadowcopy notifications using wmic.exe, a command-line utility to
access Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
WMIC.exe SHADOWCOPY /nointeractive
Wbadmin is a built-in Windows tool that allows you to backup and restore your
operating system, volumes, files, folders, and programs. Ranzy Locker uses wbadmin
to delete system state backups with the following command:
wbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP
It also uses a more specific version of this command to delete the oldest system state
backup:
wbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP - deleteOldest
BCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing Boot Configuration Data (BCD) stores
that are used to describe boot applications and boot application settings. Ranzy Locker
uses bcdedit.exe twice to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying
boot configuration data with the following commands, which are also used by REvil
(Sodinokibi) and Nefilim ransomware families.
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures

4/8

vssadmin (Volume Shadow Copy Service Admin) is another native Windows tool that
can display current volume shadow copy backups and all installed shadow copy writers
and providers. The Ranzy Locker ransomware abuses vssadmin.exe with the following
command to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery, as
also used by REvil (Sodinokibi).
vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet

prevent the recovery of encrypted files from volume shadow copies.

6.2. ATT&CK T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact
Threat actors may encrypt data on target systems or on a large number of systems
connected to a network to disrupt the system and network resource availability. They can
make stored data unusable by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives, which is a
common behavior of ransomware.
Ranzy uses the following encryption schemes.
Salsa20 to encrypt files.
RSA to encrypt Salsa20 keys.
Salsa20 is a faster encryption algorithm than RSA. So, they encrypt files with Salsa20, but
encrypt the Salsa20 keys with a more secure but slower RSA 2048 bits encryption. This
combination is also used by the recent BlackMatter ransomware.
Unfortunately, there is not a public Ranzy Locker ransomware decryption tool as of today.
Ranzy Locker creates a readme.txt file that includes the following instruction. It explains that
the files were encrypted and stolen. So, Ranzy is double extortion ransomware like
DarkSide.

buying the decryption key.
