Key findings:
At the start of the Eid Al-Fitr (Islamic holiday) weekend in early May 2022, IronNet
Threat Research detected a thread hijacking attack carrying Emotet malware against
an organization located in the Asia Pacific region.
This cyber attack is likely part of a new campaign by the MUMMY SPIDER threat
group, designed to test a new bypass for Microsoft disabling macros by default for use
in future large-scale campaigns.
This finding supports recent open-source reporting that MUMMY SPIDER has begun to
conduct more targeted operations, and it is likely the threat actors will continue to use
their access to enterprise emails to conduct further phishing attacks.

IronNet’s Network Detection and Response

(NDR) platform, in combination with our cybersecurity experts, detected an Emotet infection
in the network of a customer located in the Asia Pacific region at the start of the Eid Al-Fitr
(Islamic holiday) weekend in early May 2022. We were able to detect the aftermath of a
successful phishing attack against an employee at the company, which resulted in an
infection of a host in the client enterprise by Emotet malware. While we are still working with
our partner to assist in triage and remediation, we wanted to share our findings to increase
the communities ability to collectively defend against these types of attacks. We posit that
this attack is part of a new campaign by the MUMMY SPIDER threat group, designed to test
updated techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) for future campaigns.

This article discusses the threat group behind the attack and breaks down the postcompromise activity that occurred within the client enterprise. This attack bypassed the client
enterprise’s anti-virus protection and security products; however, IronNet’s behavioral
analytics were able to detect the post-compromise activity and quickly alert the customer to
the infection.

MUMMY SPIDER returns
MUMMY SPIDER (also known as TA54) is a threat group that utilizes various malicious
spam (malspam) email campaigns to deploy Emotet malware. First detected in 2014, Emotet
is a modular, polymorphic trojan that is capable of evading signature-based detection and
spreading throughout a victim network to compromise additional systems. Emotet often
serves as a first–or second–stage malware that can drop and download further payloads,
which could ultimately lead to data theft, remote control of systems, financial losses, and
operational disruptions. An international law enforcement effort succeeded in taking down
the Emotet botnet in 2021, but it has since resurfaced with a new focus on targeted attacks
rather than the previous “spray and pray” tactics it was once known for. We cannot claim with
absolute certainty that the group is linked to Russia; however, on April 20th 2022, a joint alert
issued by cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S., and the
U.K. mentioned the MUMMY SPIDER threat group when warning organizations of the threat
of Russian cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.
Unlike most threat groups, MUMMY SPIDER operates atypically; they will hibernate for
months at a time and conduct operations in short bursts over a several month period.
Additionally, recent reports attributed to this group have coincided with holiday seasons.
Historically, when the group resumed operations, they utilized new variants of Emotet in an
attempt to bypass security efforts. In the case of the compromise detailed in this article, we
believe that the MUMMY SPIDER threat group may have been testing a new bypass for
Microsoft disabling macros by default. This capability involves using OneDrive URLs or XLL
files instead of traditional macro-enabled documents.ProofPoint believes that the reason for
the lower-than-normal target volume is because MUMMY SPIDER is testing the success of
this new technique before adopting it on a larger scale.

Behavioral detection and incident analysis
On April 29th, 2022, at 0100UTC, an enterprise user received a phishing email with a zip file
attached. The archive contained an XLL file that the victim accidentally executed on the host
computer. This triggered a series of requests to multiple external domains, which hosted the
new Emotet malware. While a majority of these outbound requests were blocked by
enterprise security products, an outbound session succeeded to
gla[.]ge:80/old/PuVaff/ at 0151UTC and a DLL (Emotet) was downloaded. The
sample was not flagged as malicious by VirusTotal at the time of detection. IronNet observed
the host making a large volume of outbound requests to various remote servers in an
4/9

attempt to establish command and control (C2) communications. Similar to the domain
requests, a majority of these attempts were blocked, but a small number were successful.
IronDefense was able to generate alerts based on the anomalous nature of the domains, two
instances of C2 beaconing activity, and numerous threat-intelligence-based alerts.

After reporting this activity to the customer, we were informed that the attack occurred on the
Friday before a major holiday weekend; this suggests a potential attack of opportunity, which
corroborates with the new TTP that MUMMY SPIDER is assumed to be operating under.
IronNet was able to alert the customer shortly after their workday ended Friday, enabling
isolation of the infected host and mitigation during the long weekend. There is no evidence of
lateral movement attempts from the infected host, supporting the assessment that this was
isolated and thus part of MUMMY SPIDER’s new test campaign model.

Thread Hijacking
After initial triage, IronNet’s threat hunters and intel analysts requested a copy of the
phishing email used and were able to categorize this as a thread hijacking attack. Thread
Hijacking is a process in which a threat actor compromises and injects themselves into an
email thread in an effort to increase legitimacy and trust. In this instance, the actors
leveraged an email chain that involved updating a spreadsheet of delivery information,
providing a legitimate use case for the phishing target to open the attached file. While the
sender's address was not from a legitimate enterprise domain, the email was able to avoid
suspicion from the user.
When we categorized this as a thread hijacking attack, we uncovered additional concerns
that we began to investigate. Palo Alto released an article in 2020 detailing this type of
attack, which indicates the post-infection goal is exfiltrating host data via C2. This discovery
suggests the enterprise user was likely targeted, evidenced by the email being sent
specifically to the user. We were able to use this information to inform the customer that

5/9

there were likely additional infections of one or more personnel from the original email chain,
making them aware of additional thread hijacking attacks that would be likely using emails
from the victim user.
IronNet conducted a review of indicators of compromise (IOC) associated with recent
MUMMY SPIDER campaigns and identified external scanning attempts against several
enterprise customers. While most of these appeared to be generic scanning, one instance
involved a large volume of scanning against customer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
servers. We conclude this was likely an attempt to identify more malspam targets. IronNet
has since deployed Threat Intelligence Rules (TIR) and propagated the incident alerts
throughout the IronDome, enabling other IronNet customers to have increased detection
capability and reduced response time through collective defense.

Conclusion
Recent reporting indicates that MUMMY SPIDER and other actors that use Emotet have
begun to conduct more targeted operations, increasing the likelihood of spear-phishing
against enterprise employees. While preventing all enterprise users from being the victim of
a phishing attack would be ideal, it is statistically unlikely. Awareness training is
recommended and effective, but having additional layers of security in the event of
compromise is critical. This incident highlights the importance of behavioral detections as
threat actors work to evade traditional security tools and signature-based detections.
IronNet’s ability to detect the behavioral aspects of this attack prevented the threat group
from having extended access to the customer’s enterprise over a long weekend and
potentially causing further damage.
