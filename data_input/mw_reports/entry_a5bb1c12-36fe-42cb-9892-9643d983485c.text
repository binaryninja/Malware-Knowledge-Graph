We recently discovered that Cheerscrypt, the new Linux-based ransomware that we
detected in multiple attacks targeting ESXi servers, was based on the leaked Babuk source
code. Upon scrutiny, we found similarities between Cheerscrypt and the Linux version of the
Babuk ransomware, specifically its ESXi version. The base code of Cheerscrypt appears to
be derived from the Babuk source code, but modified and customized to suit the malicious
actor’s ransomware goals.
This blog entry discusses our findings and provides an overview of Cheerscrypt’s infection
routine based on the information we have gathered so far.
Brief background
Over the past few weeks, we observed several Linux-based ransomware detections that
malicious actors launched to target VMware ESXi servers, a bare-metal hypervisor for
creating and running several virtual machines (VMs) that share the same hard drive storage.
We encountered Cheerscrypt, a new ransomware family that has been targeting a
customer’s EXSi server used to manage VMware files, during this period.
In the past, ESXi servers were also attacked by other known ransomware families such as
LockBit, Hive, and RansomEXX as an efficient way to infect many computers with
ransomware.
This blog entry provides an overview of Cheerscrypt’s infection routine based on the
information we have gathered so far.
Infection routine
The ransomware requires an input parameter specifying the path to encrypt so that it can
proceed to its Infection routine.

Upon execution, it implements the following command to terminate VM processes using
ESXCLI:
“esxcli vm process kill –type=force –world-id=$(esxcli vm process list|grep ‘World
ID’|awk ‘{print $3}’)”
The termination of the VM processes ensures that the ransomware can successfully encrypt
VMware-related files. Similar to other infamous ransomware families, Cheerscrypt employs
the double extortion scheme to coerce its victim to pay the ransom, as shown on their
ransom note in Figure 2.

Cheerscrypt’s ransom note
Successfully encrypted files are renamed with the .Cheers extension. However, the
ransomware first renames the files it will encrypt before encrypting the files. Thus, if the
access permission for the file was not granted, it cannot proceed with the actual encryption.

sample before encryption.
For each directory it encrypts, it will drop the ransom note named, “How to Restore Your
Files.txt”. It seeks out log files and VMware-related files with the following extensions:

·

.log
.vmdk
.vmem
.vswp
.vmsn

After successful encryption, it displays the following console that contains the data statistics
of its routine:

Encryption algorithm
Cheerscrypt’s executable file contains the public key of a matching key pair with the private
key being held by the malicious actor. The ransomware uses SOSEMANUK stream cipher to
encrypt files and ECDH to generate the SOSEMANUK key. For each file to encrypt, it
generates an ECDH public-private key pair on the machine through Linux’s /dev/urandom. It
then uses its embedded public key and the generated private key to create a secret key that
will be used as a SOSEMANUK key. After encrypting the file, it will append the generated
public key to it. Since the generated private key is not saved, one cannot use the embedded
public key with the generated private key to produce the secret key. Therefore, decryption is
only possible if the malicious actor’s private key is known. The infection chain is shown on
Figure 5.

New findings: Cheerscrypt linked to Babuk
Unlike Cheerscrypt, Babuk’s malware version used to compromise ESXi servers ensured
that the files were encrypted before it renamed the target files. This goes to show that
despite the Babuk ransomware operator’s announcement of their retirement — after claiming
they already achieved their goals — their impact can still affect different organizations when
other malicious actors build upon the source code they leaked. We provide Babuk’s source
code for the malware variant specific to ESXi servers in Figure 6. In Figure 7, we can see
that Cheerscrypt’s source code was based on Babuk’s source code that was leaked before.

Conclusion
ESXi is widely used in enterprise settings for server virtualization. It is therefore a popular
target for ransomware attacks. As mentioned, compromising ESXi servers has been a
scheme used by some notorious cybercriminal groups because it is a means to swiftly

spread the ransomware to many devices. Organizations should thus expect malicious actors
to upgrade their malware arsenal and breach as many systems and platforms as they can for
monetary gain.
Recommendations
A proactive stance that ensures solid cybersecurity defenses against modern ransomware
threats is crucial for organizations to thrive in an ever-changing threat landscape. To protect
systems against similar attacks, organizations can establish security frameworks that
systematically allocate resources based on an enterprise’s needs.
Organizations can benefit from following the security frameworks established by the Center
of Internet Security and the National Institute of Standards and Technology when developing
their own cybersecurity strategies. The frameworks they created help security teams to
mitigate risks and minimize exposure to threats. Adopting the best practices discussed in
their respective frameworks can save organizations the time and effort when they customize
their own. Their frameworks guide organizations through the entire process of planning while
providing suggestions on measures that need to be established first.

New findings showed that Cheerscrypt, a new Linux-based ransomware variant that
compromises ESXi servers, was derived from the leaked Babuk source code. We discuss
our analysis in this report.
