An extensive surveillance operation targets specific groups of individuals with malicious
mobile apps that collect sensitive information on the device along with surrounding voice
recordings.
Researchers with CheckPoint discovered the attack and named it Domestic Kitten. The
targets are Kurdish and Turkish natives, and ISIS supporters, all Iranian citizens.
The data collected by Domestic Kitten from compromised phones includes a wealth of
information, as detailed below:
contact lists
call records
text and multimedia messages
browser history and bookmarks
geographical location
photos
recordings of nearby conversations
list of installed apps

The threat actor uses three mobile applications that are of interest to the potential victims: a
wallpaper changer, an app purporting to offer news updates from ANF (a legitimate Kurdish
news website), and a fake version of the Vidogram messaging app.
The wallpaper changer is designed to lure victims by offering them ISIS-related pictures to
set as the screen background.

The certificate used for signing all three apps, a requirement installing them on an Android
device, was issued in 2016. This suggests that the campaign escaped detection for two
years.
To exfiltrate data from a compromised device the apps use HTTP POST requests to the
command and control (C2) server available at newly registered domains.
One of the apps also contacts a website (firmwaresystemupdate[.]com) that resolved to an
Iranian IP address initially but changed to a Russian address.

All data delivered to the C2 is encrypted with the AES algorithm and can be decrypted with
a device ID the attacker creates for each victim.

Domestic Kitten Makes Thousands of Collateral Victims
CheckPoint's analysis shows that 240 users have fallen victim to operation Domestic Kitten.
More than 97% of them are Iranians, the rest being victims in Afghanistan, Iraq and Great
Britain.
However, due to the comprehensive nature of the surveillance of the campaign, private
information of thousands of individuals has been compromised.
They are not necessarily the object of the surveillance, but collateral victims whose details
were leaked from contact lists or conversations with the targets.

Clues point to state-backed Iranian APT
In a report shared with BleepingComputer, the researchers say that the operator of
Domestic Kitten remains unconfirmed, but based on the political conditions in the region
they believe Iranian government entities are behind it.
"Indeed, these surveillance programs are used against individuals and groups that could
pose a threat to the stability of the Iranian regime. These could include internal dissidents
and opposition forces, as well as ISIS advocates and the Kurdish minority settled mainly in
Western Iran," CheckPoint explains.
They say that the nature of the targets, the apps and the attack infrastructure are clues that
support the theory of an Iranian origin.
