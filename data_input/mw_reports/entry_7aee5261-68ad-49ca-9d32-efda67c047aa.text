Key Findings
Preventing ransomware today largely has shifted from a direct email threat to an
indirect threat where email is only part of the attack chain.
Ransomware threat actors leverage cybercriminal enterprises – largely banking trojan
distributors – for malware deployment. These access facilitators distribute their
backdoors via malicious links and attachments sent via email.
Banking trojans were the most popular malware distributed via email, representing
almost 20% of malware seen in Proofpoint data the first half of 2021.
Proofpoint currently tracks at least 10 threat actors acting as initial access facilitators or
likely ransomware affiliates.
Ransomware is rarely distributed directly via email. Just one ransomware strain
accounts for 95% of ransomware as a first-stage email payload between 2020 and
2021.
There is not a 1:1 relationship between malware loaders and ransomware attacks.
Multiple threat actors use the same malware payloads for ransomware distribution.

Overview
Ransomware attacks still use email -- but not in the way you might think. Ransomware
operators often buy access from independent cybercriminal groups who infiltrate major
targets and then sell access to the ransomware actors for a slice of the ill-gotten
gains. Cybercriminal threat groups already distributing banking malware or other trojans may
also become part of a ransomware affiliate network. The result is a robust and
lucrative criminal ecosystem in which different individuals and organizations increasingly
specialize to the tune of greater profits for all—except, of course, the victims.
Preventing ransomware via email is straightforward: block the loader, and you block the
ransomware.

Typically, initial access brokers are understood to be opportunistic threat actors
supplying affiliates and other cybercrime threat actors after the fact, for example by
advertising access for sale on forums. But for the purposes of this report, we consider initial
access brokers to be the groups who obtain initial access via first-stage malware
payloads and may or may not work directly with the ransomware threat actors.
These criminal threat actors compromise victim organizations with first-stage malware
like The Trick, Dridex, or Buer Loader and will then sell their access to ransomware
operators to deploy data theft and encryption operations. According to Proofpoint data,
banking trojans – often used as ransomware loaders – represented almost 20% of malware
observed in identified campaigns in the first half of 2021 and is the most popular malware
type Proofpoint sees in the landscape. Proofpoint has also observed evidence of
ransomware deployed via SocGholishwhich uses fake updates and website redirects to
infect users, and via Keitaro traffic distribution system (TDS) and follow-on exploit kits which
operators use to evade detection.
Proofpoint has unique visibility into initial access payloads – and threat actors that deliver
them – often used by ransomware threat actors. It is important to note ransomware is not the
only second-stage payload associated with the identified malware. In addition to email threat
vectors, ransomware threat actors leverage vulnerabilities in software running on network
devices exposed to the internet or insecure remote access services for initial access.

Map of the Ransomware Ecosystem
Proofpoint currently tracks around a dozen threat actors likely operating as initial access
brokers, and many of the email threat campaigns distributing malware loaders observed by
Proofpoint have led to ransomware infections. Confirmation of actor collaboration between
access brokers and ransomware threat actors is difficult due to threat actors working hard to
conceal their identity and evade detection. It is possible that initial access brokers and
malware backdoor developers directly collaborate with – or operate as – ransomwarespecific threat actors.
Initial Access Facilitators
The versatile and disruptive malware Emotet previously served as one of the most prolific
distributors of malware enabling costly ransomware infections between 2018 and 2020.
However, international law enforcement disrupted the malware in January 2021, wiping out
its infrastructure and preventing further infections.
Since the Emotet takedown, Proofpoint observed consistent, ongoing activity from The
Trick, Dridex, Qbot, IcedID, ZLoader, Ursnif, and many others in our data serving as firststage malware payloads in attempts to enable further infections, including ransomware

attacks. Proofpoint tracks these malware families under the “banking” family. Over the last six
months, banking trojans were associated with more than 16 million messages, representing
the most common malware type observed in our data.
Additionally, Proofpoint tracks downloaders such as Buer Loader and BazaLoader that are
often used as an initial access vector for ransomware attacks. In the last six
months, Proofpoint identified almost 300 downloader campaigns distributing
almost six million malicious messages.
Proofpoint researchers track backdoor access advertised on hacking forums from various
threat actors. Depending on the compromised organization and its profit margins, access can
be sold anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. Access can be purchased with
cryptocurrency, most commonly bitcoin.
Proofpoint observes overlap between various threat actors, malware, and ransomware
deployments. Our data and third-party reporting indicate for example, Conti ransomware has
been associated with multiple first-stage loaders including Buer, the Trick, Zloader,
and IcedID. IcedID has also been associated with Sodinokibi, Maze, and Egregor
ransomware events.
TA800
TA800 is a large cybercrime actor Proofpoint has tracked since mid-2019. This threat actor
attempts to deliver and install banking malware or malware loaders including The
Trick, BazaLoader, Buer Loader, and Ostap. Its payloads have been observed distributing
ransomware. Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA800 is related to third-party
reporting detailing BazaLoader implants that threat actors leveraged to distribute Ryuk
ransomware.
TA577
TA577 is a prolific cybercrime threat actor tracked by Proofpoint since mid-2020. This actor
conducts broad targeting across various industries and geographies, and Proofpoint has
observed TA577 deliver payloads including Qbot, IcedID, SystemBC, SmokeLoader, Ursnif,
and Cobalt Strike.
Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA577 is associated with a March 2021 Sodinokibi
ransomware infection. TA577 initially compromised the victim via emails containing malicious
Microsoft Office attachments, which, when macros are enabled, download and
run IcedID. Activity observed by this actor increased 225% in the last six months.
TA569

5/11

TA569 is a traffic and load seller known for compromising content management servers and
injecting and redirecting web traffic to a social engineering kit. The threat actor leverages
fake updates to prompt users to update their browser and download a malicious script.
Proofpoint has tracked TA569 since 2018, but the actor has existed since at least the end of
2016.
Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA569 is associated with
WastedLocker ransomware campaigns that appeared in 2020 that leveraged
the SocGholish fake update framework for ransomware distribution. Third-party entities
associate this ransomware with a Russian cybercrime group known as Evil
Corp. However, Proofpoint does not assess TA569 is Evil Corp.
TA551
TA551 is a threat actor tracked by Proofpoint since 2016. This actor frequently leverages
thread hijacking to distribute malicious Office documents via email and demonstrates broad
geographic and industry targeting. Proofpoint has observed TA551
distribute Ursnif, IcedED, Qbot, and Emotet.
Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA551 IcedID implants were associated with Maze
and Egregor ransomware events in 2020.
TA570
One of the most active Qbot malware affiliates, Proofpoint has tracked the large cybercrime
threat actor TA570 since 2018. Qbot has been observed delivering ransomware
including ProLock and Egregor. TA570 may use compromised WordPress sites or file hosting
sites to host their payloads. TA570 has been observed conducting thread hijacking that
distributes malicious attachments or URLs. In the last six months, TA570 activity is up almost
12%.

delivered, and the associated ransomware deployed because of the initial access. Sourcing
for these items is linked in the above descriptions for each actor.
TA547
TA547 is a prolific cybercriminal threat group primarily distributing banking trojans to various
geographic regions including ZLoader, The Trick, and Ursnif. This actor often
uses geofencing, so payloads may not be accessible to users in all regions. Attempts to
access payloads from VPNs are also often unsuccessful since the actor blacklists VPN exit
IP addresses. Over the last six months, the number of identified campaigns from this actor
spiked almost 30%.
TA544
This high-volume cybercriminal threat actor regularly installs banking malware and other
malware payloads, various geographic targeting including Italy and Japan. This threat actor
is likely a malware affiliate working with different developers. TA544 has been observed
distributing Ursnif and Dridex trojans and has sent over eight million malicious messages in
the last six months according to Proofpoint campaign data.
TA571

7/11

Since 2019, Proofpoint has tracked TA571 and its attempts to distribute and install banking
malware. This actor distributes Ursnif, ZLoader, and Danabot and often uses legitimate file
hosting services or compromised or spoofed infrastructure for payload
hosting. Typically, TA571 distributes more than 2,000 messages per campaign.
TA574
Proofpoint researchers observed TA574 distribute over one million messages in the last six
months according to campaign data. This high-volume cybercrime threat actor conducts
broad industry targeting and attempts to deliver and install malware
including ZLoader. Typically, this group distributes malicious Office attachments and
leverages some techniques including geotargeting and detecting User Agents before
malware is deployed. Proofpoint researchers have tracked TA574 since June 2020.
TA575
TA575 is a Dridex affiliate tracked by Proofpoint since late 2020. This group distributes
malware via malicious URLs, Office attachments, and password-protected files. On average,
TA575 distributes almost 4,000 messages per campaign impacting hundreds of
organizations.
First-Stage Ransomware
Proofpoint still sees ransomware distributed via email directly, as attachments or links in
email, at considerably lower volumes. For example, in 2020 and
2021 Proofpoint identified 54 ransomware campaigns distributing just over one
million messages.
Of these, Proofpoint identified four Avaddon campaigns containing about a
million messages in 2020, representing 95% of the total. In May 2021, the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation released details on an increase in Avaddon activity, noting
the ransomware operators obtained initial access via remote access portals such as RDP
and VPN, a pivot away from direct email access. This operational shift is consistent with
Avaddon campaigns observed in Proofpoint data.
Other ransomware leveraging email directly as an access vector and have appeared in
Proofpoint data this year include Hentai OniChan, BigLock, Thanos, Demonware,
and Xorist.

Diversification of the Criminal Enterprise
Proofpoint’s Threat Research team analyzed data from 2013 to present to better understand
observed trends associated with ransomware and email as an initial access vector.
Proofpoint observed that ransomware campaigns distributed directly via email as
attachments or links occurred at relatively low, consistent volumes before 2015, at which
8/11

point threat actors began distributing ransomware via email at considerably higher volumes.
Threat actors would send large numbers of messages to individual email addresses
containing the malicious files or URLs that would infect the victim when clicked on or
downloaded. Locky, for example, was sent in as many as one million messages per day in
2017 before its operations abruptly stopped.

Figure 2: Ransomware volumes as a first-stage malware
Proofpoint data shows a significant drop in first-stage ransomware campaigns in 2018.
Multiple factors contributed to the pivot away from ransomware as a first-stage payload,
including improved threat detection, individual encryption activities resulting in limited
payouts, and the introduction of wormable and human-operated threats that had
exponentially more disruptive capabilities.

How Hackers Hunt
Ransomware threat actors currently carry out “big game hunting,” conducting open-source
surveillance to identify high-value organizations, susceptible targets, and companies’ likely
willingness to pay a ransom. Working with initial access brokers, ransomware threat actors
can leverage existing malware backdoors to enable lateral movement and full domain
compromise before successful encryption.
An attack chain leveraging initial access brokers could look like this:
1. A threat actor sends emails containing a malicious Office document
1. A user downloads the document and enables macros which drops a malware payload
1. The actor leverages the backdoor access to exfiltrate system information
1. At this point, the initial access broker can sell access to another threat actor

1. The actor deploys Cobalt Strike via the malware backdoor access which enables lateral
movement within the network
1. The actor obtains full domain compromise via Active Directory
1. The actor deploys ransomware to all domain-joined workstations

Outlook
So far in 2021, Proofpoint continuously observes email-based threats including
downloaders and bankers with multi-stage payloads that often lead to ransomware
infections. The threat actors are conducting extensive reconnaissance, privilege
escalation, and lateral movement within the environment before manually deploying the
ransomware payload. One key metric to watch is dwell time. Over the last two years, multiple
public reports from incident response companies point to a decrease in the amount of time
threat actors spend within an environment before encryption activities. Some incidents are
reporting two-day infection timelines between initial access and ransomware
deployment compared to reported averages of 40 days in 2019.
Short dwell times, high payouts, and collaboration across cybercriminal ecosystems have led
to a perfect storm of cybercrime that the world’s governments are taking seriously. In
response to recent high-profile ransomware attacks, the United
States government proposed new efforts to combat ransomware, and it was a hot topic at

10/11

the 2021 G7 conference. It is possible with new disruptive efforts focused on the
threat and growing investments in cyber defense across supply chains, ransomware
attacks will decrease in frequency and efficacy.
