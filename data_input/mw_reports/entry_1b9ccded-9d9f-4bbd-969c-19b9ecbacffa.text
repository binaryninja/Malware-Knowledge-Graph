Introduction
Fake sites for popular software have occasionally been used by cyber criminal groups to push malware. Campaigns pushing IcedID malware
(also known as Bokbot) also use this method as a distribution technique (we also commonly see IcedID sent through email).
This week, a new round of reports appeared about Google Ads leading to a new sites pushing IcedID.

Based on these reports, on Wednesday 2022-12-14, I fired up my lab environment and did a Google search for AnyDesk and got a Google ad
as my top result. Although the Google ad showed a legitimate AnyDesk URL, it led to a fake site after I clicked the ad.
Today's diary reviews my IcedID infection from this fake AnyDesk site.
Details

Shown above: Search results when I did a quick Google search for AnyDesk.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a technique that websites use to increase their visibility for search engines like Google. Cyber criminals
occasionally use SEO to direct search traffic to malicious advertisement links. These ads redirect users to fake software sites based on
specific search terms. I've heard this technique referred to as "SEO poisoning."
The above image shows the top search results after I typed anydesk into Google search. The top result is a Google ad for AnyDesk, which
shows a legitimate URL for the official AnyDesk site.
I clicked on the ad, and it generated the following Google Ad Services URL:
hxxps://www.googleadservices[.]com/pagead/aclk?
sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjh1bP_3_n7AhXbFdQBHdF9AqwYABAAGgJvYQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAASJeRovgWCSOUdKVM_De2wE7MnzlxJn
Lks&sig=AOD64_3NZNQWkb8O_B18hKIs9Q3klfDfBw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjHl6v_3_n7AhVrkmoFHdIpAG4Q0Qx6BAgDEAE&nis=8
That generated the following URL:
hxxps://clickserve.dartsearch[.]net/link/click?&ds_dest_url=https://oferialerkal[.]online/81HqPxz2?https://anydesk.com/en/features/unattendedaccess&id=4&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4dWz_9_5-wIV2xXUAR3RfQKsEAAYASAAEgLqA_D_BwE

1/7

This led to a URL from a malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) domain oferialerkal[.]online. These malicious TDS domains frequenty
change multiple times each day. The above URL generated HTTPS traffic to oferialerkal[.]online, which then led to the following fake
AnyDesk URL:
hxxps://wwwanydesk[.]top/en/downloads/windows
This is a fake AnyDesk page, with a button to download a malicious zip archive hosted on a Google Firebase Storage URL at:
hxxps://firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com/v0/b/our-audio-370812.appspot.com/o/wnitFn4RCG%2FSetup_Win_14-12-2022_18-36-29.zip?
alt=media&token=3ef517f1-eb72-46bc-ac4b-3fb41f92d373
As I wrote this diary, the above URL still worked, and it delivered a the malicious zip archive.

Shown above: Fake AnyDesk site delivering the malicious zip archive.
The zip archive contained a Microsoft Installer (.msi) file. Double-clicking the .msi file on a vulnerable Windows host caused it to drop and run
a DLL to install IcedID on the victim's system.

Shown above: Downloaded zip archive and extracted .msi file.

Final words
We'll likely continue to see criminal groups abusing Google ads through SEO poisoning and using fake websites to impersonate popular
software. This is an effective way for criminals to distribute their malware.
