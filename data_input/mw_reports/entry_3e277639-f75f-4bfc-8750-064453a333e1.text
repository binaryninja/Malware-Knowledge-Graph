Key Findings
Proofpoint began tracking a new threat actor, TA866.
Proofpoint researchers first observed campaigns in October 2022 and activity has continued into 2023.
The activity appears to be financially motivated, largely targeting organizations in the United States and
Germany.
With its custom toolset including WasabiSeed and Screenshotter, TA866 analyzes victim activity via
screenshots before installing a bot and stealer.

Overview
Since October 2022 and continuing into January 2023, Proofpoint has observed a cluster of evolving financially
motivated activity which we are referring to as "Screentime". The attack chain starts with an email containing a
malicious attachment or URL and leads to malware that Proofpoint dubbed WasabiSeed and Screenshotter. In
some cases, Proofpoint observed post-exploitation activity involving AHK Bot and Rhadamanthys Stealer.
Proofpoint is tracking this activity under threat actor designation TA866. Proofpoint assesses that TA866 is an
organized actor able to perform well thought-out attacks at scale based on their availability of custom tools;
ability and connections to purchase tools and services from other vendors; and increasing activity volumes.

Campaign Details
Initial threat types via email: Proofpoint has observed the following examples of malicious email campaigns.
The tools used by the threat actor in the delivery stage (Traffic Distribution System (TDS), attachments, etc.)
are not necessarily unique and could have been purchased from other actors:
Publisher (.pub) attachments with macros
URLs linking (via 404 TDS) to Publisher files with macros
URLs linking (via 404 TDS) to JavaScript files
PDFs with URLs linking (via 404 TDS) to JavaScript files
Open source reporting details different post-exploitation payloads which Proofpoint has not confirmed such as
a socket.io based payload. Third-party researchers have also observed this activity start from Google Ads
instead of email spam.

3/18

Geographies targeted: Proofpoint observed campaigns primarily targeting organizations in the United States.
Proofpoint researchers also observed sporadic targeting of recipients in other countries, such as in German
recipients with German language emails on December 8, 2022, and on January 24, 2023.
Industries targeted: These campaigns affect all industries.
Email volumes and campaign frequency: Most campaigns during October and November 2022 involved only a
limited number of emails and focused on a small number of companies. Campaigns were observed on average
one to two times a week and messages contained attached Publisher files. In November and December 2022,
around the time when the threat actor switched to using URLs, the scale of operation grew, and email volumes
increased drastically. Typical campaigns consisted of thousands or even tens of thousands of emails and were
observed two to four times a week. In January 2023, the campaign frequency reduced but the email volumes
ramped up even more.

Campaign Deep Dive
On January 23-24, 2023, Proofpoint observed tens of thousands of email messages targeting over a thousand
organizations. Messages targeted organizations in the U.S. and Germany. The emails appeared to use thread
hijacking, a "check my presentation" lure, and contained malicious URLs that initiated a multi-step attack chain.

Figure 4: Overall attack chain showing the scripts, tools and malware involved.
If the user clicks on the URL, they initiate the attack chain, as follows:
The URL leads to 404 TDS which filters traffic and redirects to download of a JavaScript file
The JavaScript, if run by the user (such as by double clicking), downloads and runs an MSI package
This MSI package is the WasabiSeed installer. It executes an embedded VBS script (WasabiSeed) as
well as establishes persistence by creating an autorun shortcut in the Windows Startup folder
The WasabiSeed script
Downloads and executes a second MSI file containing Screenshotter
Continues polling the same URL for additional payloads in a loop
The second MSI file contains components of Screenshotter, a malware that has several variants
implemented in different scripting languages. Screenshotter has a single purpose of taking a screenshot
of the victim's screen and sending it to the command and control (C2) server
Actor interaction: the threat actor likely manually examines the victim's screenshot image during their
normal working hours and places additional payloads for the WasabiSeed loop to download, such as:
Screenshotter: takes more screenshots (if the actor is not satisfied with previous screenshots)
AHK Bot: the initial loop component (if actor is satisfied and wants to proceed with an attack)
AHK Bot: the bot's main component is another infinite loop that polls and downloads additional AHK
scripts. Observed scripts included:
Domain profiler: determines the machine's Active Directory (AD) domain and sends it to the C2
Stealer loader: downloads a stealer executable and loads it in memory
Rhadamanthys: the specific stealer observed loaded by AHK Bot's Stealer Loader script was
Rhadamanthys

The URL: 404 TDS
6/18

The URLs in this campaign led to 404 TDS, a Traffic Distribution System that Proofpoint has tracked since at
least September 2022. Proofpoint is not aware if this is a service sold on underground forums, but it is likely a
shared or sold tool due to its involvement in a variety of phishing and malware campaigns. While the use of a
TDS offers many benefits, generally threat actors use them to filter only the traffic they are interested in based
on geography, browser application, browser version, OS platform, and other factors.
Hundreds of random URLs in the format https://[domain.tld]/[a-z0-9]{5} were observed in this campaign. The
domains involved were registered on the day of the campaign. These domains were previously registered,
expired, and then re-sold to the TDS operator. The campaign involved 20 domains, such as
southfirstarea[.]com and black-socks[.]org, hosted on IP addresses 178.20.45[.]197 and 185.180.199[.]229.
If the parameters and conditions of the TDS filters were satisfied, users were redirected to a second URL
(enigma-soft[.]com/zm/) with additional filtering (not part of the TDS). If this filter was satisfied too, users were
redirected to a third URL (anyfisolusi[.]com/2/) to download a JavaScript file such as "Document_24_jan3559116.js".

JavaScript
The JavaScript code was lightly obfuscated with irrelevant comments, dead code, and variable substitution.
The purpose of the code is to download and execute the next stage. It does so using a Windows Installer object
(an installation and configuration service) which downloads and installs an MSI package from the Internet. The
analyzed script had the SHA256 of
d934d109f5b446febf6aa6a675e9bcc41fade563e7998788824f56b3cc16d1ed and file name of
"Document_24_jan-3559116.js".

Figure 5: JavaScript code after manual deobfuscation and clean-up.

WasabiSeed VBS
The MSI package "ke.msi" (sha256:
29e447a6121dd2b1d1221821bd6c4b0e20c437c62264844e8bcbb9d4be35f013) that was downloaded by the
JavaScript unpacks and runs an embedded VBS script "OCDService.vbs" (SHA256:
292344211976239c99d62be021af2f44840cd42dd4d70ad5097f4265b9d1ce01), that Proofpoint dubbed
WasabiSeed. The MSI package also establishes persistence for WasabiSeed via an LNK file "OCDService.lnk"
created in the Windows Startup folder.
WasabiSeed is a simple VBS downloader which repeatedly uses Windows Installer to connect to the C2 server
looking for MSI packages to download and run. It begins by obtaining the C: Drive serial number, appends it to
a URL request, and just like the JavaScript before it, passes the URL to a Windows Installer object and
InstallProduct function. The downloaded file is expected to be an MSI package. Further execution is paused
with a short sleep instruction. The function then calls itself recursively.

Screenshotter
The first payload downloaded by WasabiSeed was Screenshotter. This is a utility with a single function of taking
a JPG screenshot of the user's desktop and submitting it to a remote C2 via a POST to a hardcoded IP
address. This is helpful to the threat actor during the reconnaissance and victim profiling stage. Proofpoint
observed several variants of Screenshotter including Python-based, AutoIT-based, and JavaScript / IrfanViewbased variants. All accomplish the same functionality, with the network protocol being identical. The JavaScript
/ IrfanView variant is the latest variant at the time of publication.
As already mentioned, the Screenshotter code is packed into an MSI package (SHA256:
02049ab62c530a25f145c0a5c48e3932fa7412a037036a96d7198cc57cef1f40). The package contains three
files:
lumina.exe: an unmodified copy of IrfanView version 4.62.
app.js: This is the first file executed by the MSI package. It runs lumina.exe to capture a screenshot of the
desktop and save it as a JPG.
index.js: This is the second file executed by the MSI package. It reads in the image file taken by app.js
script, sets HTTP headers and POSTs the image to the same C2 address used by WasabiSeed,
specifically to the URL http://C2_IP/screenshot/%serial%. The value of %serial% is the same C Drive
serial number as used by WasabiSeed. This allows the threat actor to connect the beacons from
WasabiSeed to the specific screenshot submitted by Screenshotter.

AHK Bot
AHK Bot: Looper
Analyst Note: AHK Bot post-exploitation payload was received in the December 20, 2022, campaign but not
during the January 24, 2023, campaign used as the example in this report. While the post-exploitation payload
could have changed since December 20, this is still a valuable example of what can be delivered as the final
payload malware.
In certain instances, when the threat actor was satisfied with the screenshot(s) from the infected machine, an
MSI package containing the initial component of the AHK Bot was made available for WasabiSeed to
download. AHK Bot is named after the AutoHotKey language it's written in.

9/18

The AHK Bot is a collection of separate AutoHotKey scripts. Many of them share the same hardcoded C2
address (which is different from the WasabiSeed C2 address) and use the same C: drive serial in the URL
path. The initial script of the bot, the "Looper", is a simple infinite loop that receives and executes further
AutoHotKey scripts. The Looper code is packaged in an MSI package, that contains the following files:
au3.exe: Legitimate copy of “AutoHotkeyU32.exe” version 1.1.33.10, which is the AutoHotKey interpreter
executable.
au3.ahk: The Looper AutoHotKey script.

Figure 12: The MSI executes "au3.exe" AHK interpreter (see "Action2_au3.exe"), which if run without any
parameters automatically looks for and executes a file named "au3.ahk".

Figure 13: AHK Bot "Looper" component is an infinite loop attempting to download further AutoHotKey scripts
which are other components of AHK bot.

Figure 14: Network traffic generated by the Looper.

AHK Bot: Domain Profiler
Immediately after the AHK Bot Looper ran, it downloaded the next component, the Domain Profiler. This simple
script figures out the machine's AD domain and sends it to the C2. This is yet another step, in addition to the
desktop screenshots previously taken, used to help the threat actor determine the potential usefulness of the
infected machine and whether to proceed with the infection. The threat actor is likely looking for the infected
machine to be part of an Active Directory domain.

AHK Bot: Stealer Loader
The next AHK Bot component received was the Stealer Loader. This is a large AHK script that downloads,
decrypts and runs a DLL as bytes from memory. The specific DLL loaded was a malware known as
"Rhadamanthys Stealer". Theoretically, another payload could be placed at the expected payload location
"/download?path=e", however the log messages inside the code, such as "steal: load", point to this code being
tailored to loading a stealer.

Rhadamanthys Stealer
Rhadamanthys is a stealer that was initially advertised for sale on underground forums approximately in the
middle of 2022. Samples of the malware in public and private repositories can be found as early as August
2022. Researchers have published public details on this stealer, including reports
from ThreatMon and Eli Salem. The functionality includes stealing crypto wallets, steam accounts, passwords
from browsers, FTP clients, chat clients (e.g. Telegram, Discord), email clients, VPN configurations, cookies,
grab files, etc.

Further Analysis and Pivoting
Work Hours Analysis
Several parts of the attack chain involve manual intervention from the threat actor. For example, the actor can
manually initiate taking of additional screenshots (via the Screenshotter), and download of post-exploitation
malware AHK Bot and its components.
Given the manual nature of availability of these payloads, researchers attempted to plot actor working hours by
collecting payload download times. While not statistically significant (less than 50 data points were collected), it
is still anecdotally interesting. Proofpoint observed payload download times between 2am and 2pm EST. If we
assume a normal workday starting time around 9 a.m., then TA866's operational time zone could be UTC+2 or
UCT+3.

Comments in Russian Language
Researchers identified Russian language variable names and comments in some parts of AHK Bot. For
example, the Stealer Loader contains a comment "here it is not known what the function should return" in a
function responsive for running code from memory. The comment could be due to the tool developer being a
native speaker or due to code copied from other sources without removing the comment.

in Russian.

Pivoting on Tools to Find Past Activity

13/18

Based on limited reporting and observed use of AHK Bot, it appears to be in exclusive use by one or a closed
ecosystem of threat actors and can be used as a good pivot for finding potentially related campaigns.
Additionally, WasabiSeed is another good tool for pivoting into additional threat activity.
(A) The FINTEAM April 2019 campaign described by Check Point and by Trend Micro involved an attachment
named "Military Financing.xlsm".
Targeting: The description by Check Point included targeting of government organizations with specific
individuals in finance authorities or working in embassies. Hence the targeting could be either financially
or espionage motivated. Meanwhile, the targeting in the Screentime cluster was strictly financially
motivated.
AHK Bot: This malware was used in the 2019 campaign. While it was an earlier variant of the AHK Bot
used in the Screentime cluster, Proofpoint found significant similarities, especially in the networking code.
Additionally, the 2019 AHK Bot version had a "screenshotting" module built into the bot, while the current
campaigns use standalone Screenshotter malware.
Summary of similarities: There are potential overlaps in the targeting, and significant overlaps in custom
tooling used (AHK Bot).
(B) In a 2020 report, Trend Micro described financial sector targeting activity delivering a credential stealer.
This activity involved attachments named "Important_Changes.xlsm".
Targeting: According to Trend Micro, targeting included financial institutions in US and Canada. Similarly,
the targeting in the Screentime cluster was also financially motivated with geographies such as U.S. and
Germany affected.
AHK Bot: The initial Looper component observed in the 2020 report was nearly identical to the Looper
component observed in Screentime campaigns. The 2020 AHK Bot variant included a stealer
implemented as the AHK module, while the Screentime campaigns use Rhadamanthys stealer.
Summary of similarities: There are significant overlaps in both the targeting, and custom tooling used
(AHK Bot).
(C) The Asylum Ambuscade activity reported by Proofpoint in March 2022 involved an attachment named "list
of persons.xlsx".
Targeting: The Asylum Ambuscade activity targeted European government personnel in transportation,
financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe. The targeting
appears to be espionage motivated, however it's interesting to note the recurring theme of some of the
individuals being in financial roles (like in the FINTEAM cluster). Meanwhile, the targeting in the
Screentime cluster was financially motivated.
Tools: The SunSeed LUA script observed in the Asylum Ambuscade campaign is similar in functionality to
the WasabiSeed VBS tool from the Screentime campaign cluster. Both perform the same function
(downloading payloads in a loop, using C: serial as the URL path) in different programming languages.
While we have not directly observed the delivery of AHK Bot malware in response to SunSeed payload
infections, Proofpoint recognizes the distinct similarities between the two installers. Additional similarities
also exist in earlier parts of the attack chains, specifically in the use of the Windows Installer technique
leading to an MSI file. Asylum Ambuscade uses this technique in the attachment macro while Screentime
uses this technique in JavaScript and WasabiSeed VBS.
Summary of similarities: Asylum Ambuscade differs in the targeting goals from the Screentime cluster there are none or weak overlaps. There are significant overlaps in functionality of WasabiSeed and
SunSeed scripts and in earlier parts of the attack chains.

14/18

Proofpoint assesses with low to moderate confidence that these campaigns were likely performed by TA866
given the similarities in TTPs but the possibility of the tools being used by more than one actor cannot be
completely ruled out. Attribution investigation is ongoing.

Conclusion
TA866 is a newly identified threat actor that distributes malware via email utilizing both commodity and custom
tools. While most of the activity observed occurred since October 2022, Proofpoint researchers identified
multiple activity clusters since 2019 that overlap with TA866 activity. Most of the activity recently observed by
Proofpoint suggests recent campaigns are financially motivated, however assessment of historic related
activities suggests a possible, additional espionage objective.
The use of Screenshotter to gather information on a compromised host before deploying additional payloads
indicates the threat actor is manually reviewing infections to identify high-value targets. The AD profiling is
especially concerning as follow-on activities could lead to compromises on all domain-joined hosts.
It is important to note that in order for a compromise to be successful, a user has to click on a malicious link
and, if successfully filtered, interact with a JavaScript file to download and run additional payloads.
Organizations should educate end users about this technique and encourage users to report suspicious emails
and other activities.
