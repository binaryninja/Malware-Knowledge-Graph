FIN10: ANATOMY OF A CYBER EXTORTION OPERATION

INTRODUCTION

FireEye has identified a set of financially
motivated intrusion operations being
carried out by an actor we have dubbed
FIN10.
Within these clusters of activity, the attacker(s) have compromised organizations’ networks and sought
to monetize this illicit access by exfiltrating sensitive data and extorting victim organizations. We have
observed FIN10 targeting organizations in North America, predominately in Canada.
FIN10 primarily relies on publicly-available software, scripts and techniques to gain a foothold into
victims’ networks. The threat group then posts proof of the stolen data on publicly accessible websites.
Failure to pay the threat group could result in the public release of stolen data and potential disruption
or destruction of the victim’s information assets and systems.
In this report, we describe FIN10’s activities and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and provide
a glimpse into how they execute their operations.

Fire Eye has observed multiple targeted intrusions
occurring in North America — predominately
in Canada — dating back to at least 2013 and
continuing through at least 2016, in which the
attacker(s) have compromised organizations’
networks and sought to monetize this illicit
access by exfiltrating sensitive data and
extorting victim organizations. In some cases,
when the extortion demand was not met, the
attacker(s) destroyed production Windows
systems by deleting critical operating system
files and then shutting down the impacted
systems. Based on near parallel TTPs used by
the attacker(s) across these targeted intrusions,
we believe these clusters of activity are linked
to a single, previously unobserved actor or
group that we have dubbed FIN10.

FIN10: ANATOMY OF A CYBER EXTORTION OPERATION

Initial Compromise
In the majority of intrusions attributed to FIN10,
there was insufficient evidence to determine
the initial infection vector. However, in at least
two intrusions, FIN10 leveraged spear phishing
emails with malicious attachments, making
it plausible that this methodology was used
across all breaches.
• In both instances where the initial compromise
was identified, the attacker(s) used social
engineering and specifically crafted lures to
entice victims to click on a link that directed
them to a FIN10-controlled server. The server
hosted malicious artifacts that ultimately
executed code on one or more systems. In
these instances, the malicious code were
downloaders that beaconed out to attackercontrolled infrastructure.
• In one intrusion, the phishing email referenced
an updated holiday schedule for organizational
staff. The embedded URL pointed to a
malicious HTML Application (HTA) file.
• In another intrusion, a phishing email
referenced an employee questionnaire. The
embedded URL pointed to a Word Open XML
Macro-Enabled Document file (DOCM) file.
• Of note, FIN10 likely uses LinkedIn — among
other social media and public data sources
— to support the crafting of phishing emails
that appear legitimate.

Early Stage Malware
The attacker(s) primarily relied on publiclyavailable software, scripts and techniques to
gain a foothold into victims’ networks.
Meterpreter

FIN10 used Meterpreter as the primary method
of establishing an initial foothold within victim
environments. However, in one case, we also
observed the group use Splinter Remote Access
Trojan (SplinterRAT).

Meterpreter, short for the Meta-Interpreter, is
an advanced payload included in the Metasploit
Framework. It provides functionality that
would otherwise be difficult to implement in
assembly by allowing developers to write their
own extensions in the form of DLL files that can
be uploaded and injected post exploitation.
Meterpreter and most of its extensions are
executed in memory, thus largely evading
detection by standard anti-virus. Due to its
public availability, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence
has observed multiple threat actor groups use
Meterpreter in targeted attacks across various
industries.
PowerShell

Threat actors often use PowerShell to write
their own malicious utilities, which typically
decrease chance of detection by popular
endpoint security controls. When scripts are
executed with PowerShell, the scripts run inside
powershell.exe (locally) or wsmprovhasost.
exe (remotely), both of which are often trusted
processes. PowerShell provides threat actors
with the ability to create scripts that exceed the
capabilities of a standard Windows shell, batch
files and VBS files.
In the majority of cases, we observed FIN10
leveraging PowerShell Empire (a pen-testing tool
that utilizes PowerShell) for elevated persistence,
mainly by utilizing the Registry and Scheduled
Task options; however, in at least one intrusion, we
observed FIN10 use S4U tasks for this purpose,
although this method was likely abandoned in
favor of PowerShell Empire once it was released.
In at least one instance, PowerShell Empire was
used to install a randomly named service that
executed a Meterpreter PowerShell script, which
in turn executed malicious .bat files. The created
batch scripts typically contained PowerShell
commands for 32-bit and 64-bit operating
systems and upon execution could connect to
an attacker command and control (C2) server.
We have also observed FIN10 using PowerShell to
load Metasploit Meterpreter stagers into memory.

SPECIAL REPORT

Lateral Movement and Internal Reconnaissance
FIN10 routinely leverages Windows Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access systems
within the environment. More specifically,
attacker(s) leveraged RDP to authenticate to
internal systems that were configured to allow
ingress RDP connections from systems residing
outside organizational firewall perimeters.
Similarly, we have observed FIN10, in at least
two instances, use single-factor protected VPN
to connect remotely to victim networks after
stealing credentials.
In multiple events, FIN10 also leveraged
functionality within the PowerShell script
Meterpreter backdoor to perform internal
reconnaissance and move laterally throughout
the environment. Further analysis found the
attacker(s) used Meterpreter functionality
to enumerate users on remote systems and
execute additional PowerShell functionality. In
at least one network compromise, attacker(s)
moved laterally using the Local Administrator
account and deployed Metasploit Meterpreter
stagers and SplinterRAT instances on targeted
systems. SplinterRAT is an open-source red
team collaboration framework. It is a Javabased framework that was publicly available
and relatively easy to implement with limited
knowledge. In addition, SplinterRAT provides
capabilities such as file system browsing,
file upload and download, execution of

Figure 2.

shell commands and beaconing in case of
communication issues with a C2 server. Both the
Metasploit related backdoors and SplinterRAT
instances were programmed to connect to
attacker-controlled C2 servers.
We have regularly observed FIN10 use
scheduled tasks as a persistence mechanism.
For example, in at least one intrusion we
observed FIN10 create a scheduled task named
“C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Updater”,
which executed a PowerShell script encoded
in the Windows registry. The script was
configured to communicate with attackercontrolled C2 infrastructure.

System Disruption
FIN10 routinely deploys destructive batch
scripts intended to delete critical system files
and shutdown network systems. Network
degradation activity typically consisted of
the attacker(s) creating scheduled tasks on
multiple systems within the targeted network
environment to disrupt the normal operations
of those systems by rendering their operating
systems unusable. In at least two instances,
FIN10 created a scheduled task that used
the command shown in Figure 2 to delete
the Windows directory using the Microsoft
robocopy tool on critical systems within
the environment.

mkdir "C:\emptydir"
robocopy "C:\emptydir" "C:\windows\system32"/MIR | shutdown /s /t 1800

While this TTP could potentially be viewed as an attempt by FIN10 to obfuscate malicious
activity, the resulting effects of these scheduled tasks were easily detected, suggesting that
these activities were intended to lend credence to the perceived threat.

FIN10: ANATOMY OF A CYBER EXTORTION OPERATION

End-Stage Operations
We believe the primary goal of this threat group
is to steal corporate business data, files, records,
correspondence and customer PII, and then
to extort victim organizations for non-release
of the stolen data. The threat group posts
proof of the stolen data on publicly accessible
websites. Failure to pay the threat group could
result in the public release of stolen data and
potential disruption or destruction of the victim’s
information assets and systems.
Extortion

In all but one targeted intrusion we have
attributed to FIN10, the attacker(s) demanded
a variable sum payable in Bitcoin for the nonrelease of sensitive data obtained during
network reconnaissance stages (See Appendix
for sample extortion email).
• Requested sums ranged from 100 to 500
Bitcoins (roughly $124,000 to $620,000 as of
mid-April 2017).
• Notably, we identified at least two victims who
were issued the same Bitcoin address.
• In the first incident Mandiant investigated that
was attributed to FIN10, the attacker(s) did not
extort the targeted organization. However, it is
plausible that the group was still in the process
of honing its TTPs.
Data Exposure

FIN10 likely uses a combination of copy tools
and file transfer utilities to both harvest
and stage sensitive data. Data exposure is
accomplished routinely using openly-accessible
websites such as “pastebin.com,” “justpaste.it,”
and “thepiratebay.se.” We have also observed
the group using popular cloud file sharing/
storage solutions, such as Dropbox, to receive
stolen data in extortion attempts
Links to the leaked data are initially kept private
and provided solely to the victim organization as
proof of the authenticity of the compromise.
We have seen FIN10 heavily leverage the
“justpaste.it” service for these purposes.
Narrative & Messaging

Attacker(s) in all instances utilized a false flag — a
term used to describe covert operations that are
designed to deceive in such a way that activities

appear as though they are being carried out by
entities, groups or nations other than those who
actually planned and executed them.
• Based on open-source reporting, the
attacker(s) in at least one intrusion selfidentified as the “Angels_Of_Truth,” and
claimed the attacks on the victim were in
reciprocity for Canada-imposed economic
sanctions on Russia. The quality of the
Russian-language posts, however, was
considerably poor and very similar to output
obtained from online translating solutions,
making it likely the attacker(s) are not native
Russian speakers and were using this narrative
to mislead attribution attempts.
• The attacker(s) more commonly used a
moniker associated with a Serbian hacktivist
group dubbed “Tesla Team.” Given the vast
differences in external targeting calculus
— targeted industry verticals by FIN10 as
compared to political organizations, nongovernmental organizations and websites
of anti-Serb organizations targeted by Tesla
Team — and inconsistencies in tradecraft,
we doubt that the Serbian hacktivist group
Tesla Team (previously active in 2013) is
associated with FIN10.
––In at least one intrusion, we observed the
group abandon the moniker Tesla Team
in the group’s last correspondence to the
targeted victim and adopt the moniker
“Anonymous Threat Agent.”
• Emphasis in regional targeting of North
American-based organizations could
possibly suggest the attacker(s) familiarity
with the region.
FIN10 also seeks to increase its leverage by
sending multiple emails to staff and board
members of the victim organizations, notifying
them of the breach and potential consequences
for nonpayment. FIN10 also informs open-source
blogs about breaches in a likely effort to publicly
expose these breaches and apply additional
pressure on affected organizations to acquiesce
to extortion demands. Alternatively, it is just as
plausible FIN10 does this to simply maximize
exposure for victims who do not pay. Notably,
we have also observed the group engage local
journalists to publicize these breaches.

FIN10: ANATOMY OF A CYBER EXTORTION OPERATION

The relative degree of operational success enjoyed by FIN10 makes it
highly probable the group will continue to conduct similar extortionbased campaigns at least in the near term. Notably, we already have
some evidence to suggest FIN10 has targeted additional victims beyond
currently confirmed targets.
Furthermore, while FIN10 is predominantly financially motivated, as
evidenced by its preferred monetization technique (i.e., extortion), it is
plausible the group is also motivated, at least in part, by ego. For instance,
the group’s willingness to contact cyber security bloggers is likely the
result of at least two motivational factors:

1

2

To further the groups operational
objectives, likely by putting
increased pressure on targeted
victims to acquiesce to now public
extortion demands

To gain some degree of notoriety
and public exposure of the
group’s campaigns

While the secondary motivation may be a necessary byproduct of the first,
more primary objective, desire to gain notoriety could potentially influence
the group’s decision-making calculus.
Lastly, while FIN10 has seemingly only targeted organizations within two
industry verticals, it is possible the group has previously or will in the
future expand their regional and industry-specific targeting. Historically,
we have seen this type of threat activity — cyber attacks resulting in the
theft or compromise of sensitive data to be leveraged in extortion plots —
affect multiple targeted verticals.

Lessons Learned
from investigating FIN10 and
other disruptive breaches

Responding to disruptive breaches such as FIN10 is challenging and not easy to plan for given the dynamic
nature of these attacks and the attacker(s). Unlike breaches where a containment plan may be able to stop an
attacker from stealing more information, in these disruptive instances the damage may have already been done
by the time the attacker(s) contacts the victim organization. Therefore, a different response to these incidents
might be required. The following ten lessons from our incident response engagements may help organizations
deal with disruptive attacks, including those from groups such as FIN10:

REMEMBER THAT
YOU’RE DEALING

ADVERSARY

TIMING IS
CRITICAL

STAY
FOCUSED

CAREFULLY
EVALUATE
WHETHER TO
ENGAGE WITH
THE ATTACKER(S)

Just because someone
claimed they hacked
you doesn’t necessarily
make it true. Empty
extortion attempts are
not uncommon. Examine
your environment for
evidence of compromise
before considering to pay
the ransom. Usually FIN10
provides data as proof
(see the ‘Data Exposure’
section), so confirm
that the data is real and
determine if it came from
your environment.

Humans can be
unpredictable and they
may react out of emotion.
Carefully consider how
an attacker will react to
your action or inaction.
They can become more
aggressive if they get
upset. They may back
down and allow for more
time if they believe you
are trying to meet their
demands.

You need to validate
and scope the breach
as quickly as possible.
This may require the
team working nights and
weekends, so be careful
of fatigue and burnout.
You may need to approve
emergency change
requests within short order.

It’s easy to get distracted.
Evaluate whether the tasks
you are taking on will help
mitigate, detect, respond
to or contain the attack.
Remember that you’re
racing against the clock.
Focus on the must-haves
instead of the nice-tohaves and understand that
you may need to deploy
a number of temporary
solutions to address the
attack.

Attackers do not always
expect a response.
If you decide to respond,
limit the interactions
and carefully consider
everything you say.
Consider involving
law enforcement and
legal counsel in all
communications.

You will need forensic,
legal and public relations
support to get through a
disruptive breach. Identify
partners before the breach
and get them on retainer.

Understand that paying the
ransom may be the right
option, but there are no
guarantees the attacker(s)
won’t come back for
more money or simply
leak the data anyway.
Include experts in the
decision-making process
and understand the risks
associated with all options.

Most organizations have
mature backup policies so
they can recover quickly
in the event of a system
failure. However, it’s
common for the systems
containing backups to
be part of the same
environment compromised
by the attacker. Tighten
access to your backup
environment to mitigate
the risk of an attacker
accessing the system using
compromised credentials
and destroying your
backups.

Regardless of the
outcome, you should
ensure that attackers such
as FIN10 cannot come
back in and do more
damage. You also don’t
want a second attacker
targeting you because
they think you are willing
to pay a ransom. Ensure
you understand the full
extent of the breach and
implement both tactical
and strategic actions to
prevent future attackers
from gaining access.

Don’t forget to
operationalize and
enhance the temporary
solutions that were
deployed to immediately
address the attack.
Conduct penetration
testing and Red Team
assessments to validate
your security controls,
identify vulnerabilities and
fix them immediately.

SPECIAL REPORT

Conclusion
Although FireEye has observed FIN10 primarily
targeting casinos and mining organizations in
North America (with a focus on Canada), all
organizations from around the world must be
prepared to detect and respond to threats from
this group and other bad actors.
We believe the primary goal of FIN10 is to
steal corporate business data, files, records,
correspondence and customer PII for the
purposes of extorting victim organizations for
the non-release of the stolen data. Enterprises
that are contacted by a group claiming to have
their data will want to carefully assess if an
incident has actually occurred. In the case of
FIN10, we have observed them posting proof of
the stolen data on publicly accessible websites.
When dealing with these types of extortionbased attacks, we strongly recommend that
organizations work quickly, stay focused, consider
all options and potentially involve forensic, legal,
law enforcement and public relations experts
before taking any actions or communicating
with the threat actor. Strong segmentation and
controls over backups will help organizations to
quickly recover from a breach. Additionally, when
the incident has been resolved organizations
should focus on broader security improvements
and ensuring the threat actor cannot come back
in a different way.
