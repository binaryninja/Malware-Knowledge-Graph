CyberGate Threat Report

CyberGate is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to
the victim’s system. Attackers can remotely connect to the compromised system from anywhere
around the world. The Malware author generally uses this program to steal private information
like passwords, files, etc. It might also be used to install malicious software on the compromised
systems.
Overview
The initial Malware is a dropper that executes and drops a malicious file into the victim
system without the consent of the user. The dropped file starts its execution and performs
anti-VM checks to prevent the execution in any virtual environment. After which the Malware
performs various malicious activities, like Keylogging, and stealing sensitive information.
Then it creates a legitimate process to communicate with the C2 server.

Infection
The initial executable is a PE32 file, for Intel architecture compiled with .NET. It drops another
executable in the temp folder with the name “Qlezrhhlbmw.exe”.

Figure 1

The dropper when disassembled, shows classes with random generated names
“ADPRnBdJjt8XwX2FQm” and “eWANbC7fX237ucPNNr” to avoid detection and analysis.

Figure 2

Once the actual RAT is dropped, its execution begins. To remain persistent in the system, the
malware creates copies of itself in the folder “c:\\programfiles(x86)\rdns” as “windows”
as shown in the figure below. The copy of the executable gets deleted after the execution gets
completed.

Figure 3

It creates a legitimate process in firefox.exe and it injects a code using various functions as seen in
the below figure. It allocates memory through this step.

Figure 4

The malware contains functionality to read the clipboard data with the “GetClipboardData”
function as seen below. The return value of this function is the handle to a clipboard object.

Figure 5

It also retrieves information about pressed keystrokes and acts as a Keylogger using the function
“GetKeyboardState”. It gives the status of the 256-virtual keys.

Figure 6

The malware also has a functionality to retrieve handle of the desktop window of the victim
system using the functionality, “GetDesktopWindow”.

Figure 7

Anti-VM & Anti-Debug Feature
The malware performs various anti-VM checks on the victim machine. This statement is
supported with the figure shown below.

Figure 8

It also checks for the presence of kernel debugger in the system. This can be observed
because of the strings like “\\\\.\\Syser”, “\\\\.\\SyserDbgMsg” and
“\\\\.\\SyserBoot”.

Network Traffic Analysis
Once it captures the information, the malware tries to communicate with the C2 server
“aside.no-ip.org” using the foreign process i.e., firefox.exe as we can see in the below figure.

Our Honeypot Network
This report has been prepared from the threat intelligence gathered by our Honeypot network.
This Honeypot network is today operational in 62 cities across the world. These cities have at least
one of the following attributes:
▪Are landing centers for submarine cables
▪Are internet traffic hotspots
▪House multiple IoT projects with a high number of connected endpoints
▪House multiple connected critical infrastructure projects
▪Have academic and research centers focusing on IoT
▪Have the potential to host multiple IoT projects across domains in the future.
Over 3.5 million attacks a day is being registered across this network of individual Honeypots.
These attacks are studied, analysed, categorized, and marked according to a threat rank index, a
priority assessment framework that we have developed within Subex. The Honeypot network
includes over 4000 physical and virtual devices covering over 400 device architectures and varied
connectivity mediums globally. These devices are grouped based on the sectors they belong to for
purposes of understanding sectoral attacks. Thus, a layered flow of threat intelligence is made
possible.
