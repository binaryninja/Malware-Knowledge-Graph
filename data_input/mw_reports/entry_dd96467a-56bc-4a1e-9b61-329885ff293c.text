Introduction
This document discusses a recent targeted attack campaign directed
primarily at private companies involved in the research, development, and manufacture of chemicals and advanced materials. The
goal of the attackers appears to be to collect intellectual property
such as design documents, formulas, and manufacturing processes.
In addition, the same attackers appear to have a lengthy operation
history including attacks on other industries and organizations. Attacks on the chemical industry are merely their latest attack wave.
As part of our investigations, we were also able to identify and contact one of the attackers to try and gain insights into the motivations behind these attacks. As the pattern of chemical industry targets emerged, we internally code-named the attack campaign Nitro.
The attack wave started in late July 2011 and continued into midSeptember 2011. However, artifacts of the attack wave such
as Command and Control (C&C) servers are also used as early
as April 2011 and against targets outside the chemical industry. The purpose of the attacks appears to be industrial espionage, collecting intellectual property for competitive advantage.

Targets
The attackers have changed their targets over time. From late April to
early May, the attackers focused on human rights related NGOs. They
then moved on to the motor industry in late May. From June until midJuly no activity was detected. At this point, the current attack campaign
against the chemical industry began. This particular attack has lasted
much longer than previous attacks, spanning two and a half months.

The Nitro Attacks: Stealing Secrets from the Chemical Industry

A total of 29 companies in the chemical sector were confirmed to be targeted in this attack wave and another 19
in various other sectors, primarily the defense sector, were seen to be affected as well. These 48 companies are
the minimum number of companies targeted and likely other companies were also targeted. In a recent two week
period, 101 unique IP addresses contacted a command and control server with traffic consistent with an infected
machine. These IPs represented 52 different unique Internet Service Providers or organizations in 20 countries.
Companies affected include:
• Multiple Fortune 100 companies involved in research and development of chemical compounds and advanced
materials.
• Companies that develop advanced materials primarily for military vehicles.
• Companies involved in developing manufacturing infrastructure for the chemical and advanced materials
industry.

Attack methodology
The attackers first researched desired targets and then sent an email specifically to the target. Each organization typically only saw a handful of employees at the receiving end of these emails. However, in one organization
almost 500 recipients received a mail, while in two other organizations, more than 100 were selected. While
the attackers used different pretexts when sending these malicious emails, two methodologies stood out. First,
when a specific recipient was targeted, the mails often purported to be meeting invitations from established
business partners. Secondly, when the emails were being sent to a broad set of recipients, the mails purported
to be a necessary security update. The emails then contained an attachment that was either an executable that
appeared to be a text file based on the file name and icon, or a password-protected archive containing an executable file with the password provided in the email. In both cases, the executable file was a self-extracting executable containing PoisonIvy, a common backdoor Trojan developed by a Chinese speaker.
When the recipient attempted to open the attachment, they would inadvertently execute the file, causing PoisonIvy to be installed. Once PoisonIvy was installed, it contacted a C&C server on TCP port 80 using an encrypted communication protocol. Using the C&C server, the attackers then instructed the compromised computer to
provide the infected computer’s IP address, the names of all other computers in the workgroup or domain, and
dumps of Windows cached password hashes.
By using access to additional computers through the currently logged on user or cracked passwords through
dumped hashes, the attackers then began traversing the network infecting additional computers. Typically, their
primary goal is to obtain domain administrator credentials and/or gain access to a system storing intellectual
property. Domain administrator credentials make it easier for the attacker to find servers hosting the desired
intellectual property and gain access to the sensitive materials. The attackers may have also downloaded and
installed additional tools to penetrate the network further.
While the behavior of the attackers differs slightly in each compromise, generally once the attackers have identified the desired intellectual property, they copy the content to archives on internal systems they use as internal
staging servers. This content is then uploaded to a remote site outside of the compromised organization completing the attack.

Geographic Spread
Figure 1 shows the location
of infected computers. This
data is derived from the
IP addresses of machines
connecting back to the
command and control server. The majority of infected
machines are located in
the US, Bangladesh and
the UK; however, overall
there is wide geographical
spread of infections.

Figure 1

Geographic location of infected computers

Figure 2 shows the country
of origin of the organizations targeted by these attacks. While the US and UK
again figure highly here,
overall the geographical
spread is different. This
means that the infected
computers are rarely
located within the organizations’ headquarters or
country of origin.

*Additional confirmed infections exist; however, they did not contact
the command and control server during the two-week period we were
monitoring it.

There are two possible explanations for this:
• The attackers are targeting sites, or individuals in certain sites, which they know have access to certain data
that is of interest to the attacker.
• The attackers are targeting sites or individuals that they believe have less security measures in place and are
therefore an easier access point into the victims’ networks.
We can conclude that the attackers are not targeting organizations in a particular country.

Attribution
The attacks were traced back to a computer system that was a virtual private server (VPS) located in the United
States. However, the system was owned by a 20-something male located in the Hebei region in China. We internally have given him the pseudonym of Covert Grove based on a literal translation of his name. He attended a
vocational school for a short period of time specializing in network security and has limited work experience,
most recently maintaining multiple network domains of the vocational school.
Covert Grove claimed to have the U.S.-based VPS for the sole purpose of using the VPS to log into the QQ instant
message system, a popular instant messaging system in China. By owning a VPS, he would have a static IP address. He claims this was the sole purpose of the VPS. And by having a static IP address, he could use a feature
provided by QQ to restrict login access to particular IP addresses. The VPS cost was RMB200 (US$32) a month.
While possible, with an expense of RMB200 a month for such protection and the usage of a US-based VPS, the
scenario seems suspicious. We were unable to recover any evidence the VPS was used by any other authorized
or unauthorized users. Further, when prompted regarding hacking skills, Covert Grove immediately provided a
contact that would perform ‘hacking for hire’. Whether this contact is merely an alias or a different individual has
not been determined.
We are unable to determine if Covert Grove is the sole attacker or if he has a direct or only indirect role. Nor are
we able to definitively determine if he is hacking these targets on behalf of another party or multiple parties.

Technical details
As mentioned above, the threat used to compromise the targeted networks is Poison Ivy, a Remote Access Tool
(RAT). This application is freely available from poisonivy-rat.com. It comes fully loaded with a number of plug-ins
to give an attacker complete control of the compromised computer.

Delivery
The method of delivery has changed over time as the attackers have changed targets. Older attacks involved a
self-extracting archive with a suggestive name, for example: “Human right report of north Africa under the war.
scr”. The most recent attacks focusing on the chemical industry are using password-protected 7zip files which,
when extracted, contain a self-extracting executable. The password to extract the 7zip file is included in the
email. This extra stage is used to prevent automated systems from extracting the self-extracting archive. Some
example file names using this technique include:
• AntiVirus_update_package.7z
• acquisition.7z
• offer.7z
• update_flashplayer10ax.7z

An example of an email used to send
the attachment can be seen in figure

Figure 3

Malicious email

The email is quite generic, applicable to any corporate user. Some
of the subject lines will vary and may
include the name of the targeted
company in an attempt to be more
convincing.

Threat details
When the self-extracting archive file
is executed, it will drop two files.
Examples of file names that are used
include:
• %Temp%\happiness.txt
• %Temp%\xxxx.exe
The executable file, xxxx.exe in this
case, is then executed. The second
file, happiness.txt, contains custom
code in binary format that is encrypted and used by xxxx.exe. The
xxxx.exe file copies happiness.txt to
C:\PROGRAM FILES\common files\
ODBC\ODUBC.DLL and to C:\WINDOWS\system32\jql.sys. It then loads
the contents of the encrypted file and
injects it into the explorer.exe and
iexplore.exe processes.
The injected code copies xxxx.exe to
%System%\winsys.exe and connects
to the Command and Control (C&C) server on TCP port 80.
The communication with the server is a handshake using an encryption algorithm (Camellia). Once the Trojan
establishes the server’s authenticity, it expects a variable-size block of binary code that is read from the server
straight into the virtual space for iexplore.exe and then executed.
When an executable is compiled, the compiler will store some metadata in the compiled executable. One particular piece of relevant metadata is the location of the compiled code on disk. The path in this instance contained
Chinese characters and was:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\桌面\新建文件夹\读取文件\Release\读取文件.pdb
This translates to:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\[Desktop]\[New Folder]\[read the file]\Release\[read the file].pdb

Command and Control (C&C)
When executed, the Poison Ivy threat, or Backdoor.Odivy, connects to a command and control (C&C) server over
TCP port 80. A number of different C&C domains and IP addresses were identified. The domains and IPs are
listed in table 1.
The majority of samples connect to
a domain; however one subset of
samples connected directly to the IP
address 204.74.215.58, which belonged to the Chinese QQ user mentioned previously and was also associated with antivirus-groups.com.

173.252.205.36, 173.252.205.37, 173.252.205.64
begun targeting some of the same
chemical companies in this time period. Attackers are sending malicious PDF and DOC files, which use exploits to drop variants of Backdoor.Sogu.
This particular threat was also used by hackers to compromise a Korean social network site to steal records of 35
million users.
Determining if the two groups are related is difficult, but any relationship appears unlikely. The attackers
described in this document use a very basic delivery platform; compressed self-extracting archives sometimes
sent to a large number of recipients. The Sogu gang, in contrast, use PDF and DOC files in very tailored, targeted
emails. The Sogu gang use a custom developed threat – Backdoor.Sogu, whereas the group described in this
document use an off the shelf threat – Poison Ivy. While the number of Sogu targets is currently small relative to
the Poison Ivy attacks, we continue to monitor their activities.

Summary
Numerous targeted attack campaigns are occurring every week. However, relative to the total number of attacks, few are fully disclosed. These attacks are primarily targeting private industry in search of key intellectual
property for competitive advantage, military institutions, and governmental organizations often in search of
documents related to current political events and human rights organizations.
This attack campaign focused on the chemical sector with the goal of obtaining sensitive documents such as proprietary designs, formulas, and manufacturing processes.
