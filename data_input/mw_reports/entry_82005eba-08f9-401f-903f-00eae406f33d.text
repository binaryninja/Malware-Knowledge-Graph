Ransomware gang wants to short the stock price of their
victims

The operators of the Darkside ransomware are expanding their extortion tactics with a new
technique aimed at companies that are listed on NASDAQ or other stock markets.
In a message posted on their dark web portal, the Darkside crew said it is willing to notify
crooked market traders in advance so they can short a company’s stock price before they list
its name on their website as a victim.

The Darkside crew believes that the negative impact of having a traded company’s name
listed on its website would be enough to cause its stock price to fall and for a crooked trader
to make a profit.
“While other ransomware families previously discussed how to leverage the effect of a
publicly disclosed cyber attack on the stock market, they have never made it their official
attack vector,” Dmitry Smilyanets, threat intel analyst at Recorded Future, told The
Record today.
“DarkSide becomes the first ransomware variant to make it formal.”
However, the announcement also serves as an indirect method to threaten hacked
companies that not paying the ransom demand could result in negative press large enough
to impact their market listings and enough to push some victims into paying the asked
ransom.
This approach is just the latest in a long list of techniques that ransomware gangs have been
adding to their extortion arsenals.
Other gangs have previously used:
cold-calls to threaten victims that were preparing to restore data from backups
tried making personal threats against the executives responsible for approving the
ransom payment
threatened to notify business partners
threatened companies with DDoS attacks
threatened companies that they’d notify journalists about their security breaches
threatened to notify privacy watchdog agencies about a breach so the company can
get fined
and even sent emails to a victim’s clients, asking the customers to put pressure on the
company to pay its ransom demand and avoid having the customers’ data leaked
online

All of these tactics are usually deployed once ransomware gangs learn that a company
whose data they stole and/or encrypted does not plan to pay the demanded ransom fee.
Once the original ransom demand is declined, ransomware groups start putting additional
pressure on victims with the tactics listed above.
“We have anecdotal evidence that fewer people are paying ransom, which means
ransomware actors have to find new ways to extort money from victims,” Allan Liska, a
security researcher at Recorded Future specialized in the ransomware landscape, told The
Record in an interview today.
“We saw that with threats of DDoS attacks last year but those didn’t really seem to work so
they are looking for other ways,” Liska added.
However, the chances of this new extortion technique working are slim. In a tweet today,
Liska said that none of the previous ransomware attacks were severe enough to cause longterm damage to a company’s market listing, with the price taking only small hits for very short
periods.
Shorting ransomware victim stock is something that @thegumshoo and I have been
speculating about for a while. BUT, most companies don’t take a noticeable hit in their
stock price after a ransomware attack – at least not long term. https://t.co/CIBGN13Sl6

Furthermore, any large short bets are most likely to be picked up and investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies, and not many traders are
likely to take up Darkside’s offer for such minimal gains and maximum regulatory risks.
