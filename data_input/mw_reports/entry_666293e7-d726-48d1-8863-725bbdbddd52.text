>> The Malwares
# Using both customized version of public
available malware and self-developed malware.
# Reuse shared code (lego) code heavily.
˃ Shared code are reused among different groups
˃ One of the keys to recognize attacks from DPRK
• Very difficult to correlate with C&C infrastructure

˃ We called these shared code “legos”!

˃ We introduce some “legos” codes, exploits and webshell
for identify attacks from DPRK cyber army.
˃ Cyber attacker from DPRK frequently reuse function
codes in their attacks.
˃ We are building a shared code library called “The
Legos” project. Encouraging researchers to release the
YARA rules of lego functions.
˃ The legos indicates a share code database or dedicated
group responsible for tools development.
˃ More attacks from Lazarus/Bluenoroff/Andariel are
exceptive, be prepared and update to the latest
intelligence.
