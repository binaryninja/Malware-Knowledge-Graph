Executive Summary
In early August, Unit 42 researchers discovered attacks leveraging several vulnerabilities in devices made by DLink, a company that specializes in network and connectivity products. The vulnerabilities exploited include:
CVE-2015-2051: D-Link HNAP SOAPAction Header Command Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2018-6530: D-Link SOAP Interface Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2022-26258: D-Link Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2022-28958: D-Link Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
If the devices are compromised, they will be fully controlled by attackers, who could utilize those devices to conduct
further attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The exploit attempts captured by Unit 42
researchers leverage the aforementioned vulnerabilities to spread MooBot, a Mirai variant, which targets exposed
networking devices running Linux.
While D-Link has published security bulletins regarding all the vulnerabilities mentioned here, some users may be
running unpatched or older versions or devices. Unit 42 strongly recommends applying upgrades and patches
where possible.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers receive protections through cloud-delivered security
services such as IoT Security, Advanced Threat Prevention, WildFire and Advanced URL Filtering, which can
detect and block the exploit traffic and malware.

D-Link Exploit Payloads
The attacker utilizes four D-Link vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution and download a MooBot
downloader from host 159.203.15[.]179.
1. CVE-2015-2051: D-Link HNAP SOAPAction Header Command Execution Vulnerability

Figure 2. CVE-2015-2051 exploit payload.The exploit targeting the older D-Link routers takes advantage of
vulnerabilities in the HNAP SOAP interface. An attacker can perform code execution through a blind OS command
injection.
2. CVE-2018-6530: D-Link SOAP Interface Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Figure 3. CVE-2018-6530 exploit payload.The exploit works due to the older D-Link router's unsanitized use of the
“service” parameters in requests made to the SOAP interface. The vulnerability can be exploited to allow
unauthenticated remote code execution.
3. CVE-2022-26258: D-Link Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

3/9

Figure 4. CVE-2022-26258 exploit payload.The exploit targets a command injection vulnerability in the /lan.asp
component. The component does not successfully sanitize the value of the HTTP parameter DeviceName, which in
turn can lead to arbitrary command execution.
4. CVE-2022-28958: D-Link Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Figure 5. CVE-2022-28958 exploit payload.The exploit targets a remote command execution vulnerability in the
/shareport.php component. The component does not successfully sanitize the value of the HTTP parameter value,
which can lead to arbitrary command execution.

Table 2. Attack-related artifacts.
Unit 42 researchers conducted analysis on the downloaded malware sample. Based on its behavior and patterns,
we believe that the malware samples that were hosted on 159.203.15[.]179 relate to a variant of the Mirai botnet
called MooBot.

Figure 6. MooBot random string generator.
The most obvious feature of MooBot is the executable file containing the string
w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f, which will be used to generate random alphanumeric strings.
Upon execution, the binary file prints get haxored! to the console, spawns processes with random names and wipes
out the executable file.

Figure 7. MooBot creates processes.
As a variant, MooBot inherits Mirai’s most significant feature – a data section with embedded default login
credentials and botnet configuration – but instead of using Mirai’s encryption key, 0xDEADBEEF, MooBot encrypts
its data with 0x22.

6/9

Figure 8. MooBot configuration decode function.
After decoding its C2 server vpn.komaru[.]today from configuration, MooBot will send out a message to inform the
C2 server that a new MooBot is online. The message starts with the hardcoded magic value 0x336699.
At the time of our analysis, the C2 server was offline. According to the code analysis, MooBot will also send
heartbeat messages to the C2 server and parse commands from C2 to start a DDoS attack on a specific IP address
and port number.

Conclusion
The vulnerabilities mentioned above have low attack complexity but critical security impact that can lead to remote
code execution. Once the attacker gains control in this manner, they could take advantage by including the newly
compromised devices into their botnet to conduct further attacks such as DDoS.
Therefore, we strongly recommend applying patches and upgrades when possible.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the vulnerability and malware through the following products
and services:
Next-Generation Firewalls with a Threat Prevention security subscription can block the attacks with Best
Practices via Threat Prevention signatures 38600, 92960, 92959 and 92533.
WildFire can stop the malware with static signature detections.
The Palo Alto Networks IoT security platform can leverage network traffic information to identify the vendor,
model and firmware version of a device and identify specific devices that are vulnerable to the aforementioned
CVEs.
Advanced URL Filtering and DNS Security are able to block the C2 domain and malware hosting URLs.
In addition, IoT Security has an inbuilt machine learning-based anomaly detection that can alert the customer
if a device exhibits non-typical behavior, such as a sudden appearance of traffic from a new source, an
unusually high number of connections or an inexplicable surge of certain attributes typically appearing in IoT
application payloads.
