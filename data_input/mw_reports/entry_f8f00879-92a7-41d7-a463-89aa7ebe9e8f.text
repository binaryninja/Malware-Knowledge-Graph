winnti-detector detects Winnti (as of 2016/2017) communication patterns in network traffic.
It can read PCAPs or listen on a live interface.

Winnti
Winnti is a malware that is used by some APT groups.
It has been used since at least 2013 and has evolved over time. You can find some
information here

Handshake
The driver component of Winnti (aka "NdisReroute") is able to reroute network traffic from
ports that are already occupied by legit applications to the malware's userspace component.

1/3

The first packet of a TCP stream signals the driver that the stream shall be rerouted. I call
such a packet a "Winnti HELO". It is exactly 16 bytes long and the bytes match the following
relation:
Winnti handshake Example:
dw0
5B 44 B4 91

dw1

dw2

dw3

31 18 30 59 ^ {6A 5C} [84 C8]

dw0 calculated from dw2 and dw3
dw1 random but not zero. Only seen timestamps in here but any value works.

Installation
winnti-detector uses libnids which you can install with
# git clone https://github.com/MITRECND/libnids.git
# cd libnids
# ./configure --enable-shared && make && sudo make install
# sudo ldconfig -i

You can then compile and run winnti-detector
# make
# ./wntidect
wntidect version 1.6 using libnids 1.25 -- Stefan Ruester
Usage: ./wntidect <-i device|-f pcapfile> [-l]
-l Log to syslog (local7.alert 'nsm')

Output
stdout
$ wntidect -f finding.pcap

syslog

2/3

As the usage text suggests, you can use the parameter -l to write syslog entries whenever
a match is found. The program always also outputs findings on stdout.
