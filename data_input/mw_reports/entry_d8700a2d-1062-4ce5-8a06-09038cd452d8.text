Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti: attacks on servers

Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT

Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is a widely known APT group active since at least 2010. The group tends to
attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies attacked
by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious
concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased
significantly.
The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting
various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs.
Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main
targets.
Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked
the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.
This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected
and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers
compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017.

Waterhole
All waterhole servers are infected following the same pattern: injecting a link into a web page or JS file
with the following file scheme: file://IP/filename.png.

Injected link with the file scheme
The link is used to initiate a request for an image, as a result of which the user connects to the remote
server over the SMB protocol. In this attack type, the attackers' goal is to extract the following data from
the session:





user IP,
user name,
domain name,
NTLM hash of the user’s password.

It should be noted that the image requested using the link is not physically located on the remote server.

Scanned resources
Compromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the process of
analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had scanned
with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided below).

The sites and servers on this list do not seem to have anything in common. Even though the scanned
servers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned different
resources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the attackers’ tools and,
subsequently, to develop the attack.
Part of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting waterhole
resources.
In some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went
through the list of possible domains matching a given IP.
In most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with the possible
exception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel chain.
Curiously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to which
were found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner:
www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru

Toolset used
Utilities
Utilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:












Nmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security.
Dirsearch — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive searches of)
directories and files on websites.
Sqlmap — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of identifying
and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database servers.
Sublist3r — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. The tool uses
open-source intelligence (OSINT). Sublist3r supports many different search engines, such as
Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd,
DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. The tool helps penetration testers to collect information on the
subdomains of the domain they are researching.
Wpscan — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e., works without
access to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress sites in search of security
issues.
Impacket — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by SMBTrap.
SMBTrap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address, user name,
domain name, password NTLM hash).
Commix — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in Python.
Subbrute – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses an open
name resolver as a proxy and does not send traffic to the target DNS server.
PHPMailer – a mail sending tool.

In addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers. The script was
designed to check FTP hosts from an incoming list.

Malicious php files
The following malicious php files were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in a working
directory created by the attackers on an infected web servers:

Modified sshd
A modified sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the server.
Patches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are available on
GitHub, for example:
https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit
Compilation is possible on any OS with binary compatibility.

As a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server, an attacker can
use a ‘master password’ to get authorized on the remote server, while leaving minimal traces (compared
to an ordinary user connecting via ssh).
In addition, the modified sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections (this does not apply to the connection
that uses the ‘master password’), including connection times, account names and passwords. The log is
encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock.

Decrypted log at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock

Activity of the attackers on compromised servers
In addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity was also
identified.
After gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times.
Specifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers:





apt install traceroute
apt-get install nmap
apt-get install screen
git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git

Additionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.
The diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one month.
The attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most cases, they logged on to the server at
roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:

Conclusion
The findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are as
follows:
1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. The use of publicly
available utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution without
any additional group ‘markers’ very difficult.
2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want
to establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities.
3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching for
vulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication data.
4. The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests.
5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or
takes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data collection, the theft of
authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack’s further
development.
