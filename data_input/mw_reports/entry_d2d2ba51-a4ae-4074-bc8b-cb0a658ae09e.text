CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Recorded Future analyzed an intrusion into one of our client’s networks and
collaborated with Rapid7 to determine the scope of a cyberespionage campaign
assessed to be conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, APT10. This report
details the campaign using data acquired from targeted host networks, the Recorded
Future® Platform, network metadata, VirusTotal, Farsight DNS, Shodan, and other
OSINT techniques.
Norwegian company Visma, which was targeted in the attack, and U.S. company
Rapid7 provided support and extensive expertise throughout this research. Industry
collaboration is a vital enabler in illuminating threats and offering protection to
organizations at risk from hostile, state-sponsored economic cyberespionage.
This report will be of most value to network defenders and corporate risk executives
within companies that utilize services from managed IT service providers and cloud
hosting providers. The report will also be of interest to companies with an exposed
third-party supply chain.

Executive Summary
A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three
companies in the United States and Europe was uncovered
by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November 2017 and
September 2018. Based on the technical data uncovered, and in
light of recent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on
the ongoing activities of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, we
assess with high confidence that these incidents were conducted by
APT10 (also known as Stone Panda, menuPass, CVNX) in an effort
to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property
or gain commercial advantage.
The targeted companies included:
• IT and business cloud services managed service provider
(MSP) and Recorded Future client and supplier, Visma, a
billion-dollar Norwegian company with at least 850,000
customers globally
• An international apparel company
• A U.S. law firm with strong experience in intellectual property
law with clients in the pharmaceutical, technology, electronics,
biomedical, and automotive sectors, among others
In all three incidents, the attackers gained access to networks
through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software
using stolen valid user credentials. The attackers then enumerated
access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks,

utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert
on APT10 to deliver malware. During the Visma intrusion, APT10
deployed their Trochilus malware with command and control (C2)
communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming
ciphers rather than the typically observed RC4 variant. On the two
other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of
the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by
APT10.
APT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using
WinRAR (deployed by the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox
account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool. The same
Dropbox account was also accessed in a similar fashion by the
attackers during the apparel company intrusion. Dropbox was also
used to store exfiltrated documents from the third victim, a U.S.
law firm, with the files again exfiltrated using identical TTPs and
uploaded using cURL for Windows.
We believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored
cyber threat to global corporations known to date. On top of the
breadth, volume, and targets of attacks that APT10 has conducted
since at least 2016, we now know that these operations are being
run by the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security
(MSS).
Utilizing actors working for shell companies such as Huaying Haitai
Science and Technology Development Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展
有限公司), and under the direct supervision of their regional bureau
in Tianjin, the MSS has conducted an unprecedented campaign,
dubbed “Operation Cloud Hopper,” against managed IT service
providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable
secondary attacks against their clients. Access to the networks of
these third-party service providers grants the MSS the ability to
potentially access the networks of hundreds, if not thousands,
of corporations around the world. We assess that APT10 likely
compromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary
intrusions onto their client networks, and not of stealing Visma
intellectual property.
In this same time frame, APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and
an international apparel company, likely to gather information for
commercial advantage. In all three incidents, APT10 actors used

previously acquired legitimate credentials, possibly gained via a
third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access
to the law firm and the apparel company.

Key Judgments
• We have identified a new variant of Trochilus malware, with
its C2 communications encrypted using a combination of RC4
and Salsa20 stream ciphers.
• An UPPERCUT backdoor was identified in the targeting of
an international apparel company and U.S. law firm. The
backdoor was deployed using the Notepad++ updater and
sideloading malicious DLL, as noted in APT10’s targeting of
Japanese corporations in July 2018.
• In addition to using Trochilus and UPPERCUT, APT10 utilized a
series of previously known and associated attack TTPs for all
three of these intrusions. Some of these TTPs include:
• Transferring tools from the C2 to the host using
BITSAdmin-scheduled tasks into C:\ProgramData\temp

• Use of DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Background
APT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. It has
historically targeted healthcare, defense, aerospace, government,
heavy industry and mining, and MSPs and IT services, as well as
other sectors, for probable intellectual property theft.
In early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global
managed IT service providers (MSPs) that granted them
unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers’ networks.
During this operation (dubbed “‘Cloud Hopper” because of the
group’s use of popular western cloud-based services), APT10 utilized
both new malware (Quasar RAT, Trochilus, RedLeaves, ChChes) as
well as some familiar old tools (Poison Ivy, PlugX).
Most recently, on December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice
charged two hackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State
Security (MSS) with global computer intrusion campaigns targeting
intellectual property. This indictment attributed the intrusions to
APT10, a group that had been conducting the malicious activities
for over a decade on behalf of the MSS, China’s civilian human
intelligence agency. Some of the material included within the
indictment corroborated information detailed in the Intrusion Truth
blog that provided strong evidence attributing APT10 to the Tianjin
State Security Bureau, a provincial bureau of the Ministry of State
Security. In the blog, Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having
utilized several Tianjin-based companies, including Huaying Haitai
Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd. and Laoying Baichen
Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd.

The use of suspected shell companies as a front for MSS-enabled
cyber activity isn’t a new observation, however. Our research from
2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC (and therefore the MSS)
directed the activities of a company named Boyusec, which was
identified as a shell company for APT3.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious
activities breached at least 45 companies and managed service
providers in 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab
Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
About Visma
Visma offers software and services that simplify and digitize
core business processes in the private and public sector. The
Visma group operates across the entire Nordic region along with
Benelux, Central, and Eastern Europe. With 8,500 employees, more
than 850,000 customers, and a net revenue of NOK 8,537 million
(approximately $1 billion USD) in 2017, Visma is one of Europe’s
leading software companies.
Intrusion Overview
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for
several years, focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs
and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation
Cloud Hopper report in 2017. We were particularly interested in
identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were
subsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access
through compromised MSP networks.
In September 2018, one of our clients (and a supplier as well),
Visma, reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident
uncovered on their network following a breach notification by
Rapid7. Visma provided us with malware samples and network logs
from the event. Analysis of the data revealed that Visma’s Citrix
infrastructure had been probed and subsequently accessed using
stolen credentials as early as August 17, 2018. This was followed
by an initial exploitation, network enumeration, and malicious tool
deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial
access. The theft of enterprise login credentials was conducted
within two and a half weeks of initial access.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

On August 30, 2018, APT10 deployed their first modified version
of Trochilus that had its C2 communications encrypted using
Salsa20 and RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild. This
sample, similar to other Trochilus samples, was deployed using a
DLL sideloading method utilizing three files, uploaded to the same
folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory TA17117A (last revised on December 20, 2018). This method involves the
use of a legitimate binary (File 1) used to load a malicious DLL (File
2). The malicious DLL is renamed to match the name of an expected
DLL to be loaded by the executable. The malicious DLL then decrypts
and decompresses shellcode contained within a third file placed by
the attackers in the same temporary folder. The configuration file
then loads the Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a
valid system process. This method of malicious payload installation
is a well-documented TTP of APT10.
The attackers used Mimikatz (pd.exe) to enable credential theft and
made use of scheduled tasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility
to transfer files from their C2 to the Visma network. The attackers
preferred to upload their malicious tooling to the C:\ProgramData\
temp or C:\ProgramData\media directories and executed commands
using batch files (x.bat). A full list of the filenames of the suspected
attacker tooling can be found in the report appendices.

BITSAdmin example commands used by the attackers.

In order to exfiltrate the compromised data, the attackers employed
custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2. They also used
WinRAR and cURL for Windows, both often renamed, to compress
and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the
Dropbox API.
Our research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and
found that the attackers had used the same account to store
exfiltrated data from a global apparel company. They also identified

broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a U.S. law firm
specializing in intellectual property law. The firm has a dedicated
China practice aimed at assisting Chinese companies entering the
U.S. market.
Rapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in
late 2017, followed by the apparel company a few months later,
and finally, the Visma attack in August 2018. In one of the attacks,
Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in order
to run the payload script on the victim desktop. Interestingly, in all
three attacks, the targeting of Citrix remote desktops was a common
thread. Additionally, the same DLL sideloading technique observed
in the Visma attack was used, and many of the tools deployed by
the attackers shared naming similarities as well (1.bat, cu.exe,
ss.rar, r.exe, pd.exe). Most interestingly, Rapid7 observed the use
of the Notepad++ updater gup.exe as a legitimate executable to
sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to deploy a variant
of the UPPERCUT backdoor (also known as ANEL). APT10 used
this approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese
corporations in July 2018.
The Visma Attack
APT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around
August 17, 2018. Examination of network logs revealed an employee’s
credentials were stolen and used to authenticate to the network
outside of her normal working hours. While we are confident that
APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using
stolen employee Citrix remote desktop credentials, it is not clear
how or when these credentials were initially compromised.
Throughout August 2018, the APT10 actors regularly logged in to
the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user
accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8
timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours. On
each occasion, the logins were from one of eight VPN endpoints
that resolved to IPs in the following tightly defined subnets:

manages 44/24 subnets hosted around the world, many of which
resolve to low-cost VPN services, such as ExpressVPN.
Insikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN
endpoint IPs revealed consistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted
infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs starting on August
17, 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s
network was made using stolen credentials.
After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers
used their access to the network to move laterally and made their
first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted variant of the
Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading
technique. Two separate infection chains leveraging this specific
DLL sideloading technique were identified on the Visma network
using legitimate known good binaries that had DLL search-order
path issues. This means that APT10 actors had two separate access
points into the Visma network.
Infection Chain 1: August 30, 2018
Once on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft
BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected
attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \
ProgramData\temp\ directory on the infected host.

Malware Analysis
The malware sets used for both infection chains are nearly identical
both in infection method and code structure. Because the malware
for both infection chains were so similar, it is only necessary to
include the in-depth analysis for one chain here, so we focused on
Infection Chain 1. It included the binaries below:
• CASTSP.exe: A valid and signed application that utilizes DLL
sideloading to execute the malicious DLL, “version.dll”
• Version.dll: Main functionality of “Version.dll” is to decrypt and
execute the Trochilus payload
• CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI: DES-encrypted Trochilus payload
Trochilus Implant
The Trochilus loader, version.dll, has four entry points, as
shown below. The malicious entrypoint called by CASTSP.exe is
DllEntryPoint.

After version.dll runs, it loads the file CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI
into memory. The file “CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI” is 387,094 bytes
of binary code that is not human-readable.

After the file is loaded, the next function, sub_6a351000, starts the
decryption routine for CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI. The file is DESencrypted and the key can be identified being loaded into memory
at the start of the decryption routine.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

This variant of Trochilus is significantly different from some of the
reported variants.1 The C2 infrastructure, network communications,
and encryption are different from prior versions, but the code
similarities and the use of DLL sideloading demonstrate that this
is just another variant of Trochilus. First, the libraries below are
included in the Trochilus variant and are known to be a part of the
source code upon which Trochilus is based on.
• SelfDestruction.cpp
• MySocket.cpp
• CommManager.cpp
• Common.cpp
• Main.cpp
• Manager.cpp
• ServiceManager.cpp
• TCPComm.cpp
• UDPComm.cpp
Second, the unencrypted C2 beacon, _msgid.23.__serial.0.clientid.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, is a well-defined component of the Trochilus
source code.
The capabilities of Trochilus are well documented in other research
reports, but the C2 infrastructure for this variant uses a combination
of XOR, RC4, and Salsa20, which is different from what has previously
been reported for Trochilus.
Command and Control Infrastructure
The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com is hardcoded, and after
a successful DNS request for the IP address, the Trochilus implant
will use that IP address for communication.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The encoding and encryption routines used in this variant are
different from other variants and use three stages of encryption.
Other variants have typically used XOR encoding with RC4 encryption
to obfuscate C2 communication.
Stage 1: Rolling XOR Function
The first stage is a simple rolling XOR function. The rolling XOR key
is computed by taking two initial values, Constant 1 and Constant
2, and adding them together. The result is then divided against the
divisor 0xff. The remainder of this result is used as the XOR key. On
the second iteration, Constant 1 is now saved as Constant 2, and
Constant 2 becomes the remainder from the previous operation.
They are added together and again divided by the divisor 0xff to
produce the next XOR key. This process repeats until the end of
the cleartext string. A Python script is provided below showing this
encoding function.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0206 | 16

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Our analysis revealed that the “__msgid.23.” cleartext string below
was sent to the XOR function above.

Stage 2: RC4 Encryption
The resulting data then goes to the second stage, which is RC4
encryption using the hard-coded string NASDKJF7832Hnkjsadf87
8UHds89iujkhNHKJDHJDH8UIYE98uihwjshewde8w. The main
routine shown below takes the key and then sends it to the function
sub_B49252, which initializes the key-scheduling algorithm (KSA)
and pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA), which are the
two key components of RC4 encryption.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0206 | 17

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Stage 3: Salsa20 Encryption
For the final phase, the resulting data from the RC4 encryption is
then encrypted again, this time with Salsa20. Salsa20 is another
stream cipher that encrypts data in 64-byte blocks. Salsa20 uses a
secret key and nonce to initialize the encryption. These values are
hard-coded and are:
• Secret Key: 0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,0x5,0x6,0x7,0x8,0x9,0xA,0xB,0xC,
0xD,0xE,0xF,0x10
• Nonce: 0x65,0x66,0x67,0x68,0x69,0x6A,0x6B,0x6C (“efghijkl”)

Infrastructure
DNS log data revealed that requests were made for the malicious
Trochilus C2 domain, www.miphomanager[.]com, as early as August
30, 2018 — only two weeks after Visma was initially compromised
on August 17, 2018. This slight delay may point to the handing over
of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team
APT10 effort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack.
According to WHOIS information, the malicious "miphomanager"
domain was registered with a relatively small Bahamas-based
domain registrar, internet.bs. This registrar is widely noted to host
a disproportionate number of rogue or malicious websites, with the
registrar aggressively marketing itself as an “offshore” registrar. Other
examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs
include domains for APT28’s VPNFilter malware campaign and the
registration of the cyber-berkut[.]org domain that was affiliated
with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat
actor CyberBerkut.
The registrant organization name was privacy protected using Whois
Privacy Corp, and the registered name servers for the malicious C2
were listed as:
• Ns-canada.topdns[.]com
• Ns-uk.topdns[.]com
• Ns-usa.topdns[.]com
Internet.bs and the name servers listed above were noted in the
registration of a malicious C2 used in a KHRAT campaign targeting
Cambodia. KHRAT is a backdoor trojan purported to be used with
the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK.
All three name servers appear in Recorded Future with an unusual
risk rating as they appear in the “Bambenek Consulting C&C
Nameserver Blocklist” threat list, because of their prevalence in
being associated with a Zeus-based banking trojan, Sphinx.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Credential Harvesting and Exfiltration
During our investigation, we also found evidence of a legitimate
decompression utility typically packaged with Java named
“unpack200.exe” being executed on the Visma network. This utility
sideloaded Mimikatz (pd.exe) and enabled credential theft from
Visma users. Interestingly, the same combination of unpack200.
exe to deploy Mimikatz was used by the same attackers in both the
apparel company and U.S.-based law firm breaches.
Using the newly acquired credentials, the attacker accessed Visma’s
Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deployed Trochilus,
and made a copy of the “NTDS.DIT” database file containing Active
Directory data for Visma’s corporate network, including password
hashes for all users in the domain.
The NTDS.DIT file and accompanying stolen data was then packaged
up using a renamed WinRAR executable (r.exe) that was transferred
across by the attacker who then used cURL for Windows (renamed
to “CU.exe”) to upload the exfil to content.dropboxapi.com. The
RAR files followed a naming convention of a short run of repeating
characters (for example, kkk.rar, ss.rar, pp.rar, dds.rar, gggg.rar,
etc).
Rapid7 research revealed the exfiltrated content from Visma was
uploaded to a Dropbox account that contained files from another
incident related to the compromise of an international apparel
company that they were investigating.
US-Based Law Firm Attack
In late 2017, Rapid7 responded to a breach at a U.S.-based law firm.
The attacker first gained access to the victim environment through
Citrix servers. Once inside the victim network, the attacker deployed
their own customized malware and also used known good binaries
that have DLL search order hijacking issues in order to perform DLL
sideloading to execute customized versions of Mimikatz in order
to retrieve passwords. The filename for the custom malware was
“ccSEUPDT.exe” (MD5: d8e37f07fdc9827871f0f959519275e1), a
legitimate Symantec Security Submission Engine Update Module
binary. The custom malware also would have a DLL in the same staging

shellcode. The attacker used unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955b
afffa568b6da0e785c), a decompression program that
comes with Java 8 and their copy of Mimikatz was placed
into MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: c8ea12ee884f274ca35fa54a073
df130).
These methods of initial ingress into the victim networks and the
method of obtaining passwords remained consistent TTPs across
all victims. The DLL sideloading technique can evade application
whitelisting and antivirus software. However, if deployed, systems
that perform process.start creation would log the command line
being passed to the binary and could be reviewed, and then
signatures created that look for the common flags could be passed
to Mimikatz. The attacker would also move laterally by mounting the
remote drive on a system, copying “1.bat” to it, use task scheduler
to execute, and then delete the batch script.
In order to perform exfiltration of the stolen data, the attacker used
common file compression utilities (rar.exe) to create archives of
the information they intended to exfiltrate, and then used common
command line-based web clients (curl.exe) to transfer the stolen
data to a cloud-based storage provider (Dropbox). This TTP for data
exfiltration remained consistent across all victims.
To maintain access to the victim network from the external
public internet, the attacker deployed password-protected
ASP eval webshells (Filename “iisstart.aspx,” SHA256:
243d47fc2a24b391e1153d5c7807c6e5de51aba65fc79465d7b3e
5c64d5fac41) within the client environment in order to maintain
access.

This resembled the server-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper
webshell documented previously. Uploads to VirusTotal in late
August 2018 resembling the same filename, iisstart.aspx, indicate
the deployed webshell was likely a version of the China Chopper
webshell known to have been used by several Chinese threat actors.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The attacker also used TeamViewer in order to maintain remote
access to compromised systems within the victim environment.
International Apparel Company Attack
In early 2018, Rapid7 identified that the attackers compromised an
apparel company, based upon detections and intelligence gathered
from the U.S.-based law firm breach. The attacker gained access to
the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and authenticated to
them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned
by VPN Consumer Network. Rapid7 again observed the attackers
dropping payloads named “ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used
identical TTPs for executing malware and Mimikatz as observed
before, by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that had
DLL search order path issues. The attackers used the Notepad++
updater GUP.exe (MD5: f5322b2f18605674b9a0c1757de5fd94),
the Java archive decompression utility unpack200.exe
(MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), renamed
from “coInst.exe,” and Norton Identity Safe binary CASRTSP.
exe (MD5: 1e3a57cff7cba8732364c26f4bbdcbe2). These
binaries were used to load malware from DLL files
MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: 5739c1f17503e21e56667d53ea823401)
and libcurl.dll (MD5: 8f07160febdb240909b27aa519b
ba575). Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in the victim’s
environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2.
The attackers used the same method of lateral movement by
mounting the remote drive on a system, copying 1.bat to it, using
task scheduler to execute the batch script, and finally, deleting the
batch script.
For exfiltration of stolen data, the attacker used WinRAR and
renamed “rar.exe” to “r.exe” to create archives, upload them with
“curl.exe” (renamed to “c.exe”), and again, use the cloud storage
provider Dropbox. Rapid7 discovered that additional data was
placed into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker
during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was
placed into it as being owned by Visma. Rapid7 then provided a
breach notification to Visma to alert them to this compromise in
September 2018.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outlook
We identified three victims of cyberespionage operations since
late 2017 across the managed IT service provider, retail, and legal
sectors. The targeted sectors vary significantly, indicating a wide
scope of targeting for the group. We assess with high confidence
that the attacks were conducted by Chinese MSS threat actor APT10,
based on the evidence outlined in this report, summarized below:
1. The use of a variant of the Trochilus malware. While the
variant has not been noted publicly previously, Trochilus
is widely used by APT10.
2. The use of legitimate binaries to sideload malicious DLLs
that decrypt and decompress shellcode configuration files
containing a Trochilus payload.
3. The use of Notepad++ updater (filename “gup.exe”) to load
malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in the deployment of the APT10
backdoor, UPPERCUT.
4. Extensive use of command-line tools including, but not
limited to, Mimikatz, cURL for Windows, BITSAdmin, and
WinRAR, to perform actions on-host.
5. The targeting of a Norwegian MSP, which enabled potential
access to an extensive customer base. We believe that the
APT10 targeting of Visma is an extension of their 2017 Cloud
Hopper operation (which victimized some of the world’s
largest MSPs) and has continued into late 2018.
6. The unauthorized access to Citrix remote desktop clients at
Visma using stolen credentials occured at times
corresponding to Tianjin working hours (GMT +8).
We believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese
state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations. Their
unprecedented campaign against MSPs, alleged to have
included some of the largest MSPs in the world, in order to
conduct secondary attacks against their clients, grants the
Chinese state the ability to potentially access the networks of
hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0206 | 24

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

This campaign brings to light further evidence supporting
the assertions made by the Five Eyes nations, led by the U.S.
Department of Justice indictment against APT10 actors outlining the
unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being conducted
by the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Crucially, the variety
of businesses targeted prove that these campaigns are being
conducted against corporations across the commercial spectrum,
aimed at undermining international norms in trade to erode the
competitive advantage of companies that have invested heavily in
patented technology.
This report, alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10
operations, acutely highlights the vulnerability of organizational
supply chains. Often, third parties in the supply chain are less likely
to adopt high-end, expensive security measures, and therefore offer
an attacker a convenient access vector to target interconnected
organizations. Also, the targeting of cloud providers exploits the
trust companies place in the security of the cloud services they use.
Based on publicly available information, we assess that this intrusion
was conducted by the group that is known as APT10. However,
during the course of this investigation, we have had privileged
conversations that lead us to believe that in the future, portions of
what is now known as APT10 will be recategorized as a new group.
There is insufficient data at this time to make that distinction.

Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following
measures outlined in this section in conjunction with the advice
published by US-CERT2 and the U.K.’s NCSC3 when defending against
APT10 attempts to gain network access.
• Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion
prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms
in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
illicit connection attempts from — the external IP addresses
and domains listed in Appendix A.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

• Implement the provided SNORT rules in Appendix B into your
IDS and IPS appliance and investigate any alerts generated for
activity resembling the TTPs outlined in this report on APT10.
• Conduct regular Yara scans across your enterprise for the new
rules listed in Appendix C and those listed in the official U.S.
and U.K. government advisories listed above.
• Consider blocking any connection attempts emanating from
IPs resolving to “VPN Consumer Network” (listed in Appendix
B) and consider implementing a VPN whitelisting policy based
on approved vendors.
• Detection of potential ASP eval webshells can be difficult, but
can be accomplished by deploying file integrity monitoring
of the web root directories on all servers with a client
environment.
• Detection of exfiltration based on network flow data would be
difficult if the attacker chose to use the same cloud storage
provider that the victim has standardized upon. However, if
SSL is proxied for monitoring, signatures can be created to
identify this activity by checking the user agent or method
of client header construction against the Dropbox client
applications themselves.
• Ensure you have DNS response policy zones enabled for your
enterprise. If so, consider detecting, alerting, and blocking
requests for the nameservers below associated with the
disproportionately malicious domain registrar internet.bs:
• ns-uk.topdns.com
• ns-usa.topdns.com
• ns-canada.topdns.com

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Appendix F — Visma Statement
How Visma Managed the Case
All timelines and methods are documented in this report from
Recorded Future and Rapid7.
Visma’s intelligence systems gave them warning about the theft
(a threat hunter from Rapid7 used the Visma Global Responsible
Disclosure Policy). Visma correlated the intelligence from Rapid7
against their internal alerts and mitigated the threat. They soon
confirmed that none of their clients’ systems were affected.
The Visma Corporate Security Incident Response Team (Visma
CSIRT) worked closely with their Product Security Operations Center
(PSOC), NSM NorCERT, as well as the police.
After initial attribution (using data from Recorded Future, among
other systems), Visma decided to contract an external partner
(Recorded Future) to dig deeper into the incident report and gather
additional intelligence in order to ensure proper attribution to
better understand this threat actor.
In this case, no client data was compromised, and Visma chose not
to issue a general alert before they had conclusive evidence on who
performed the theft.
They assisted NSM NorCERT and others in the investigation and
general cleanup of this case.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Retrospective
Visma does not see any reason to question Recorded Future or
Rapid7’s attribution in this case, but Visma wants to give a general
warning about general nation-state-backed advanced persistent
threat actors that seem to target businesses and governments alike
with their advanced attack methods.
From Visma’s experience and data, it can be observed that
most threat actors seem to have their own methods, tools, and
playbooks that may be used to identify them when carrying out a
decent analysis of their actions. Their motivation for these actions
is sometimes quite tricky to understand, but most can probably
be classified as espionage, preparations for later hybrid warfare
operations, or similar.
Visma sees evidence of similar attempts against their systems quite
often, but since this one was successful in stealing something and
was quite advanced, they want to put out a warning about this
particular threat actor.
They are thankful for the guidance and advice from NSM NorCERT,
police, and other cooperating parties in this case and urge all
business entities to explore the opportunities that are available in
CERT cooperation.
Visma has transparency as a carrying principle for their business
and will publish data on nation-state and criminal attacks against
them both now and in the future. They will share information to
ensure public awareness of these matters and to motivate others
to do the same.
