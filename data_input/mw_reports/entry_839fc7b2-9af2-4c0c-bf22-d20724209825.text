UPDATE: September 26, 2018:
This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos on
seven new Stage 3 modules. For further details see below.
UPDATE: June 6, 2018:
This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos.
This includes an expanded list of vulnerable devices and details on a newly discovered stage
3 module known as “ssler” which could permit the attackers to perform man-in-the-middle
(MitM) attacks on traffic going through vulnerable routers and allow them to intercept web
traffic and insert malicious code into it. For further details see below.

A new threat which targets a range of routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices is
capable of knocking out infected devices by rendering them unusable. The malware, known
as VPNFilter, is unlike most other IoT threats because it is capable of maintaining a
persistent presence on an infected device, even after a reboot. VPNFilter has a range of
capabilities including spying on traffic being routed through the device. Its creators appear to
have a particular interest in SCADA industrial control systems, creating a module which
specifically intercepts Modbus SCADA communications.
According to new research from Cisco Talos, activity surrounding the malware has stepped
up in recent weeks and the attackers appear to be particularly interested in targets in
Ukraine. While VPNFilter has spread widely, data from Symantec's honeypots and sensors
indicate that unlike other IoT threats such as Mirai, it does not appear to be scanning and
indiscriminately attempting to infect every vulnerable device globally.
Q: What devices are known to be affected by VPNFilter?
A: To date, VPNFilter is known to be capable of infecting enterprise and small office/home
office routers from Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link, Ubiquiti,
Upvel, and ZTE, as well as QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. These include:

Q: How does VPNFilter infect affected devices?
A: Most of the devices targeted are known to use default credentials and/or have known
exploits, particularly for older versions. There is no indication at present that the exploit of
zero-day vulnerabilities is involved in spreading the threat.
Q: What does VPNFilter do to an infected device?
A: VPNFilter is a multi-staged piece of malware. Stage 1 is installed first and is used to
maintain a persistent presence on the infected device and will contact a command and
control (C&C) server to download further modules.
Stage 2 contains the main payload and is capable of file collection, command execution,
data exfiltration, and device management. It also has a destructive capability and can
effectively “brick” the device if it receives a command from the attackers. It does this by
overwriting a section of the device’s firmware and rebooting, rendering it unusable.
There are several known Stage 3 modules, which act as plugins for Stage 2. These include a
packet sniffer for spying on traffic that is routed through the device, including theft of website
credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Another Stage 3 module allows
Stage 2 to communicate using Tor.
A newly discovered (disclosed on June 6) Stage 3 module known as “ssler” is capable of
intercepting all traffic going through the device via port 80, meaning the attackers can snoop
on web traffic and also tamper with it to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Among its
features is the capability to change HTTPS requests to ordinary HTTP requests, meaning
data that is meant to be encrypted is sent insecurely. This can be used to harvest credentials

and other sensitive information from the victim’s network. The discovery of this module is
significant since it provides the attackers with a means of moving beyond the router and on
to the victim’s network.
A fourth Stage 3 module known as “dstr” (disclosed on June 6) adds a kill command to any
Stage 2 module which lacks this feature. If executed, dstr will remove all traces of VPNFilter
before bricking the device.
Details on seven more Stage 3 modules were released on September 26, 2018. These
include:
“htpx”: Similar to ssler, it redirects and inspects all HTTP traffic transmitted through
the infected device to identify and log any Windows executables. This may be used to
Trojanize executables as they pass through infected routers, providing attackers with a
way of installing malware on computers connected to the same network.
“ndbr”: A multi-function SSH tool.
“nm”: A network mapping tool which can be used to scan and map the local subnet.
“netfilter”: A denial of service utility which may be used to block access to some
encrypted applications.
“portforwarding”: Module which forwards network traffic to attacker-specified
infrastructure.
“socks5proxy”: Module to enable establishment of a SOCKS5 proxy on compromised
devices.
“tcpvpn”: Allows establishment of a Reverse-TCP VPN on compromised devices, enabling
remote attacker to access internal networks behind infected devices.
Q: What should I do if I’m concerned my router is infected?
Concerned users are advised to use Symantec's free online tool to help check if their router
is impacted by VPNFilter. This also includes instructions on what to do if the router is
infected.
Q: What do the attackers intend to do with VPNFilter’s destructive capability?
A: This is currently unknown. One possibility is using it for disruptive purposes, by bricking a
large number of infected devices. Another possibility is more selective use to cover up
evidence of attacks.
Q: Do Symantec/Norton products (Win/Mac/NMS) protect against this threat?
A: Symantec and Norton products detect the threat as Linux.VPNFilter.

for sharing information on this threat in advance of publication.

UPDATE: Netgear is advising customers that, in addition to applying the latest firmware
updates and changing default passwords, users should ensure that remote management is
turned off on their router. Remote management is turned off by default and can only be
turned on using the router's advanced settings. To turn it off, they should go to
www.routerlogin.net in their browser and log in using their admin credentials. From there,
they should click "Advanced" followed by "Remote Management". If the check box for "Turn
Remote Management On" is selected, clear it and click "Apply" to save changes.
UPDATE May 24, 2018: The FBI has announced that it has taken immediate action to
disrupt the VPNFilter, securing a court order, authorizing it to seize a domain that is part of
the malware's C&C infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Linksys is advising customers to change administration passwords periodically
and ensure software is regularly updated. If they believe they have been infected, a factory
reset of their router is recommended. Full instructions can be found here.
MikroTik has said that it is highly certain that any of its devices infected by VPNFilter had the
malware installed through a vulnerability in MikroTik RouterOS software, which was patched
by MikroTik in March 2017. Upgrading RouterOS software deletes VPNFilter, any other thirdparty files and patches the vulnerability.
UPDATE May 25, 2018: QNAP has published a security advisory on VPNFilter. It contains
guidance on how to use the company’s malware removal tool to remove any infections.
