DDG is a mining botnet that specializes in exploiting SSH, Redis database and OrientDB
database servers. We first caught it on October 25, 2017, at that time, DDG used version
number 2020 and 2021, and we noticed that the botnet has two internally reserved domain
names that had not been registered. So we went ahead and registered the two domain
names so we were able to measure the infections, (4,391 infected IPs) The original blog is
here.
Some botnet goes away after we release the analysis report, such as http81 (persirai), but
the DDG stays.
Three months after the release of our first DDG report, in May 2018, DDG got some major
updates. Version 3010 and 3011 appeared, we also witnessed the authors effort to polish the
3011 so he can get the mining part work.
On June 12, we captured that DDG.Mining.Botnet released yet another new version 3012
with yet another c2 address. For all the technical details, please check our detailed DDG
blog here.
List of DDG Updates
The following figures describe some high level overview and comparison between different
DDG versions.

1/3

From the figure we can see:
Version Update: Starting from October 2017, DDG has released three major version of
201x, 202x, and 301x, and six minor-versions.
C2 IP address: Four major C2 IPs have bee used.
Module structure: Three major modules, propagate, keep-live, and mining
Infection method: Brute force attacks on the SSH server and unauthorized access by
the Redis server (2017-10 to date). In versions 201x and 202x, the Struts2 and
OrientDB database servers were also targeted for infection.
Wallet Address: Three wallet addresses. And the file name of the mining program
normally the same as the last 5 to 6 strings of the wallet address.
Redundancy: The author always keeps two versions of the botnet running at the same
time to provide fault tolerance. After the 301x version, the author also started to use
multiple mine pools for redundancy. Such as mining pool hk02.supportxmr.com,
pool.supportxmr.com, xmr-asia1.nanopool.org, xmr-us-west1.nanopool.org, and mining
pool proxy 47.52.57.128,165.225.157.157
In addition:
Profit: According to our incomplete statistics, DDG's wallet addresses have received at
least 7,425 Monroe coins just from Monero.crypto-pool.fr.

HUB: DDG uses a group of hacked servers to provide download service to infected
hosts. Each DDG version update refreshes this HUB_IP list. See the IoC section at the
end of this article for infected IPs.
For Sinkhole, we sinkholed two unregistered domain names for DDG version 2020. Although
the DDG 2021 version were quickly released and removed these two domain names, we
were still able to get an accurate number of the infections. At that time, we recorded a total of
4,391 victim IP addresses. The main victims were China (73%) and the United States (11%):
