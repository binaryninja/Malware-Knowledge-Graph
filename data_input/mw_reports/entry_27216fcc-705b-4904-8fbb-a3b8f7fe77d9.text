Executive Summary
In the event of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, we believe it is likely that cyber
offensive actions targeting Ukraine will primarily consist of distributed denial-of-service
attacks and website defacements against Ukrainian government and media
organizations, internet infrastructure, and e-services used by Ukrainian citizens such as
digital banking. These cyberattacks would likely aim to cause confusion, hinder
communications, weaken a Ukrainian military response, and demoralize the Ukrainian
population as part of a wider hybrid warfare operation.
Russia is almost certainly using influence assets and techniques, both covertly and
overtly, to shape domestic, Ukrainian, and international audience perceptions of its
military buildup along Ukraine’s northern, southern, and eastern borders. Key influence
narratives include that Russia, not Ukraine, is a victim of aggression; that Russia is a
defensive protector; and allegations of infighting among NATO partners.
Insikt Group has not observed Russian troop or asset withdrawal from the border of
Ukraine, and we have observed additional troops and specialized equipment moving
towards Ukraine, in line with US, NATO, and Ukrainian assessments. We further
concur with assessments that Russia is plotting a false-flag operation as a pretext for a
Russian invasion of Ukraine, with an increased presence of Russian private military
companies and recent examples of likely false-flag operations being conducted. In
addition, the Russian State Duma has prepared legislation to formally recognize the
independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk
People’s Republic (LPR).

Cyber Offensive Actions
Recent Cyber Offensive Actions Targeting Ukraine Recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine
have aligned with Russia’s strategic objectives. The cyberattacks have consisted of
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website defacements, fraudulent messaging,
and malware attacks, predominantly targeting Ukrainian government organizations, media
1/7

organizations, e-services used by citizens, and other private sector organizations. Notable
attacks are listed below:
DDoS — On February 15, 2022, powerful DDoS attacks targeted Ukraine’s armed
forces, defense ministry, public radio, and the 2 largest national banks, knocking some
services offline for 2 hours. The DDoS attacks left Ukrainians unable to use some vital
services and resulted in confusion and worry as Russian forces continue to gather on
the Ukrainian border. There has been further DDoS activity since, including targeting of
the Government Services Portal of Ukraine, though there was reportedly no effect on
the website.
Fraudulent Messaging — In coordination with the DDoS attacks against Ukrainian
organizations including banks on February 15, 2022, some users of Privatbank
received an SMS message alerting them that the bank’s ATMs were not working.
However, these messages were not sent by Privatbank, and Ukrainian cyber police
stated that “it was an information attack”.
Website Defacements — On January 14, 2022, threat actors likely serving Russian
strategic objectives defaced nearly 70 Ukrainian government websites, including
websites belonging to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, the
State Emergency Service, Cabinet of Ministers, and Ministry of Education and Science.
The attacks were later suspected to have been conducted by Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) UNC1151, a group linked to the Belarusian government that used
malware bearing similarities to tools previously used by Russian state-sponsored
APT29. The defacements vaguely warned Ukrainians to “expect the worst”, spurring
fears that the defacement is the beginning of additional threat activity preceding a
Russian conventional military campaign in eastern Ukraine.
Malware — Data-wiping malware disguised as ransomware, dubbed WhisperGate,
targeted multiple industries in Ukraine, including government, non-profit, and
information technology organizations in January 2022. Ukraine’s CERT indicated the
attacks were a false-flag operation, mimicking WhiteBlackCrypt ransomware, likely in
an attempt to make attribution more difficult. Insikt Group analyzed the WhisperGate
malware and created detection rules for our clients. We support the false-flag
assessment and note that such tactics have previously been employed by Russian
threat actors when targeting Ukraine, for example the use of BadRabbit ransomware.
Dark Web and Cybercriminal Activity Involving Ukraine Insikt Group has identified a
significant uptick in dark web advertisements and sales of data and network access methods
related to Ukraine in the last 3 months. We identified 7 Insikt Group Threat Leads related to
Ukraine in the last 12 months, with 6 of those being identified in the last 3 months. Per Insikt
Group’s report “Dark Covenant: Connections Between the Russian State and Criminal
Actors”, we believe it is highly likely that Russian intelligence services and law enforcement
have a longstanding, tacit understanding with criminal threat actors; in some cases, it is
almost certain that the intelligence services maintain an established and systematic
relationship with criminal threat actors, either through association or recruitment. Recently
identified events of interest include:
2/7

On February 2, 2022, we identified that “an3key”, a member of the mid-tier Raid
Forums, advertised a 904 GB data leak from the internal mail server of the Ministry of
Communities and Territories Development (minregion[.]gov[.]ua) of Ukraine.
On January 28, 2022, we identified that “Kristina”, a member of the mid-tier Raid
Forums, advertised a free document leak related to the Ukrainian National Police
(mvs[.]gov[.]ua). Based on sample images and threat actor indications, the
compromised information includes scans of passports, identification cards, and other
sensitive documents related to local and federal police officers throughout Ukraine and
occupied territories.
Insikt Group reported on February 10, 2022, that Raid Forums was offline for a week.
Since its reopening the week of February 14, 2022, the forum is being viewed by users
with speculation, as the forum’s administrator “Omnipotent” remains unresponsive,
other administrative-level accounts are acting irregular, and prominent threat actors on
the forum (who have operated on it for years) are abandoning their activities. We
cannot confirm if the forum has been seized by law enforcement at this time, but the
aforementioned activities are leading threat actors to abandon the forum and move
their activities elsewhere. This is a current and evolving situation, with Recorded Future
monitoring and providing relevant updates accordingly.
Assessment on Cyber Offensive Actions in the Event of a Russian Invasion In the
event of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, we believe it is likely that cyber offensive
actions targeting Ukraine will primarily consist of DDoS attacks and website defacements
against Ukrainian government and media organizations, internet infrastructure, and eservices used by Ukrainian citizens such as digital banking. These cyberattacks would likely
aim to cause confusion, hinder communications, weaken a Ukrainian military response, and
demoralize the Ukrainian population as part of a wider hybrid warfare operation.
It is also likely that a more significant cyberattack will target Ukrainian physical
infrastructure in the event of an invasion, reminiscent of previous cyberattacks against
Ukraine’s power supply and destructive pseudo-ransomware attacks. We believe it’s
almost certain that Russian state-sponsored APT groups have the capability to launch
such significant and destructive attacks.
We expect Russian state-sponsored threat actors, pro-Russian hacktivist and criminal
groups enabled by the Russian government, and APT groups linked to the Belarusian
government likely supported by the Russian government to be involved in cyber
offensive actions targeting Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian invasion of the
country.
The above assessments are based on Insikt Group’s analysis of Russian hybrid
warfare tactics targeting Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine from 2014
onwards.

Assessment on Cyber Offensive Actions Against Other Countries There are concerns
that Russian state-sponsored cyberattacks could also be launched against organizations
outside of Ukraine in conjunction with a Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The US and the
UK have issued warnings to this extent. We believe these concerns are justified based on
previous undisciplined Russian APT cyberattacks that were likely intended to target only
Ukraine but spread much wider. Furthermore, it’s plausible that Russia would seek to
conduct cyberattacks against NATO countries to distract efforts and attention away from the
invasion of Ukraine.
An example of an undisciplined cyberattack likely intended to target Ukraine specifically
is Sandworm Team’s NotPetya attack in June 2017, which was estimated to have cost
victims more than $10 billion in total. The attack first targeted Ukrainian companies on
June 27, 2017, the eve of the Ukrainian holiday Constitution Day, but spread to other
countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Australia, and even
Russia. Security company ESET claimed that 80% of victims were located in Ukraine.
There was temporary disruption of public infrastructure and business, lasting
destruction of data, and significant economic damage across 65 countries.
Another example is the BadRabbit ransomware attack in October 2017, also attributed
to Russia, which similarly appeared to spread in an uncontrolled manner, affecting
organizations primarily in Ukraine and Russia, but which also spread to other countries,
including Turkey, Germany, Poland, Japan, South Korea, and the US.

Influence Operations
Russia’s Multi-faceted and Versatile Influence Ecosystem Shaping Perceptions of
Military Build-up Russia is almost certainly using influence assets and techniques, both
covertly and overtly, to shape domestic, Ukrainian, and international audience perceptions of
its military buildup along Ukraine’s northern, southern, and eastern borders. We believe that
current Russian information operations are employing a multi-faceted and versatile approach
to manipulate the narrative of this crisis, using developed human intelligence assets on the
ground in Ukraine, covert elements of Russia’s disinformation ecosystem (such as
intelligence-directed or otherwise affiliated news sources), social media influence operations,
and official, overt propaganda through the Russian state media and political apparatus.
It is likely that the overarching goal of these efforts is to promote the rise of a proRussian or Russian-friendly government at the local and national levels of Ukraine’s
government in the long term. In the short term, these tactics are more likely aimed at
creating a destabilizing environment before a possible Russian invasion, in an attempt
at achieving victory more easily and with less cost (through loss of life, economic
damages, or other disruptions).

4/7

The Ukrainian SBU issued a statement on February 14, 2022, warning that the
“domestic information space is under unprecedented influence”, stating that “Ukraine is
facing attempts to systemically sow panic, spread fake information and distort the real
state of affairs” and that “all this combined is nothing more than another massive wave
of hybrid warfare”.
On February 9, 2022, the SBU announced that it had identified and shut down a social
media bot farm consisting of 18,000 social media accounts allegedly spreading panic
on social media as well as allegations of bomb threats on civilian and critical
infrastructure.
Key Themes of Russian Influence Operations Involving Ukraine Insikt Group has
observed ongoing Russian covert and overt influence operations promoting a false primary
narrative that Russia, not Ukraine, is a victim of aggression. These sources, often
collectively, promote allegations and statements claiming that Ukraine, with support from its
Western partners, is preparing to launch an offensive in eastern Ukraine. Often, we have
found that these claims originate from proxies in eastern Ukraine (that is, pro-Russian
separatists and their leadership), and then are amplified in Russian state media and
government sources.
In support of this larger theme, anti-American and anti-Ukrainian disinformation
narratives in Russian sources tend to portray Russia as a defensive protector, while
broadly accusing the West and Ukraine of unlawful and unjust actions. Additionally,
these sources present NATO, the US, and Ukraine as the aggressors, alleging human
rights violations against Russian minorities in Ukraine, demonizing Ukrainians as
“fascists” and “neo-Nazis” and claiming that Ukraine does not follow the internationally
recognized Minsk Agreements.
Other widespread themes more recently include allegations of infighting among NATO
partners suggesting that the West cannot achieve a consensus on how to manage
Russia, as well as negative portrayals of Western media, claiming that Western news
outlets spread malicious information about Russia in an attempt to force it into a war
with Ukraine.

Geopolitics and Physical Threats
Russian Military Activities Insikt Group has not observed Russian troop or asset
withdrawal from the border of Ukraine, despite official Russian government and media
reports of troops withdrawal. We observed new videos and photos posted on social media
continuing to show troops and specialized equipment moving towards Ukraine, in line with
the US, NATO, and Ukrainian assessments that Russia has in fact added 7,000 troops to the
border. The latest US assessments indicate that Russia has massed between 169,000 and
190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine, and we believe that Russia is in fact increasing the
capabilities of its military on the border with Ukraine.

5/7

US intelligence assessments state that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely start
with air and missile attacks on key Ukrainian military infrastructure, including airfields,
air defense, and early warning systems, and that the Russian military is likely to invade
from multiple points on the Ukrainian border in the east and the north, in an attempt to
surround Kyiv within 1-2 days. Indeed, the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service
released a report showing “targets in Ukraine compiled by Russian intelligence that, if
neutralized, can interfere with the command, recovery, and supply of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces and Ukraine’s energy supply”.
Russia’s military exercises with Belarus will conclude on February 20, 2022, as will the
Beijing Winter Olympics, which we believe will be a pivotal moment to observe whether
Russia does indeed decide to withdraw troops and military assets from Belarus and the
border with Ukraine.
Provocations and False-Flag Operations Insikt Group concurs with the US, UK, NATO,
and other assessments that Russia is plotting false-flag operations as a pretext for a Russian
invasion of Ukraine. We have observed discourse from Russian politicians suggesting there’s
a high probability that Ukraine will launch a military offensive in Donbas, that Russia has a
right to “counterattack” if it felt the need to protect Russian citizens living in eastern Ukraine,
that Russia is concerned about reports of Ukrainian violence in Donbas and is closely
monitoring the situation, and Putin comparing the actions of Ukraine in Donbas to genocide.
Furthermore, Russian private military companies have reportedly increased their presence in
Ukraine, presenting the Russian government with a further avenue to conduct a false-flag
operation. We have observed recent instances of potential false-flag attempts, including the
shelling of a kindergarten in Donbas.
On February 16, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that there is a
high probability that Ukraine will launch a military offensive in Donbas. On February 15,
2022, Putin once again compared the situation in Donbas to genocide, saying that
Ukrainian authorities are abusing the human rights of ethnic Russians in the region. On
February 14, 2022, the Russian ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov stated that
Russia has a right to “counterattack” if it felt the need to protect Russian citizens living
in eastern Ukraine.
Russian state-affiliated media continue to report on alleged Ukrainian military violence
in Luhansk and Donetsk, for example Sputnik reported on February 17, 2022,
“Ukrainian Armed Forces Fire Mortar Shells, Grenades on 4 LPR Localities”.
2 recent potential false-flag operations include the Investigative Committee of Russia’s
decision to open a criminal case on “the discovery of mass graves of victims of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine in the [Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk
People’s Republic (LPR)]” and the shelling of a kindergarten in Ukraine, with proRussian and pro-Ukrainian social media accounts accusing the other side of
conducting the attack.

6/7

On February 17, 2022, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine recorded 189 ceasefire violations, including 128
explosions, in the Donetsk region. There were a further 402 ceasefire violations,
including 188 explosions, in the Luhansk region. This represents a significant increase
from the previous day, with 24 and 129 ceasefire violations, respectively.
Russian Government Prepares Legislation to Formally Recognize LPR and DPR On
February 15, 2022, the Russian State Duma adopted a draft resolution on an appeal to the
President of the Russian Federation with a request to recognize the independence of the
self-proclaimed DPR and LPR. The document has now been sent to Russian President
Vladimir Putin for consideration.
On February 16, 2022, Wendy Sherman, the US Deputy Secretary of State, in an
interview with Ukrainian Pravda, stated that Russia recognizing the DPR and LPR
would mean the rejection of Russian obligations under the Minsk Agreements. Earlier,
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Dmytro Kuleba expressed similar views regarding the recognition of self-proclaimed
republics by the Russian government.
The heads of DPR and LPR both announced on social media that they welcomed the
position of the Russian State Duma, and are grateful to the Russian Federation amid
alleged increased aggression, including “daily shelling” and troop build-up from
Ukraine.
