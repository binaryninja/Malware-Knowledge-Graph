Operation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks conducted by advanced persistent
threats such as the Elderwood Group based in Beijing, China, with ties to the People's
Liberation Army.[2] First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post,
[1] the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.[3]
The attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems,[4]
Akamai Technologies,[5] Juniper Networks,[6] and Rackspace[7] have publicly confirmed
that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop
Grumman, Morgan Stanley,[8] and Dow Chemical[9] were also among the targets.

As a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely
uncensored version of its search engine in China "within the law, if at all," and
acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices.
[1]
Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S.
government.[10]
The attack was named "Operation Aurora" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of
Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered
that "Aurora" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two
of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. "We believe the
name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation," McAfee Chief
Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.[11]
According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially
modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor
companies. "[The SCMs] were wide open," says Alperovitch. "No one ever thought about
securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways
—much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may
have and spend so much time and effort protecting."[12]

History
On January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it
had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said
the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from
China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had
been attacked; other sources have since cited that more
than 34 organizations were targeted.[9] As a result of the
attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China.
[1] On the same day, United States Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the
attacks and requesting a response from China.[13]

On January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News
reported that the United States Congress plans to
investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service
to spy on human rights activists.[14]

In Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later
removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an "illegal flower tribute".[15]
The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous
official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.[16]

Further information: Cyberwarfare by China
Technical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other
factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The "Elderwood" group
was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is
referred to as the "Beijing Group" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of
Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists.[17]
Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms,
energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.[2][18]
The "APT" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is
APT17.[19]
Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers
that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms
then become a cyber "stepping stone" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One
attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by
employees of the target company – a so-called "water hole" attack, just as lions stake out a
watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that
downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the
network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading
executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and
product designs.[2]

Attack analysis
In its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It
suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese
dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been
attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state
security agents who claimed he was under investigation for "unspecified suspected
crimes".[20] However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and
those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation
date.[1]
Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack.[11] Two days after the
attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zeroday vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in
Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack "Operation Aurora". A week after the report by
McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue,[21] and admitted that they had known about
the security hole used since September.[22] Additional vulnerabilities were found in
Perforce,
the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.
[23][24]
VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by "agents of the
Chinese state or proxies thereof".[25]

According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source
reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer
systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed
by "government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the
Chinese government."[26] The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in
which attackers have "broken into American government computers and those of Western
allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002."[27] According to The
Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were "orchestrated by a senior member of
the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and
found articles criticising him personally."[28]
Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an
SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois,
Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace
customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate
intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of
intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.
The attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and
control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the
attackers intentionally shut them down.[29] However, the attacks were still occurring as of
February 2010.[3]

Response and aftermath
The German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of
Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until
a fix for the security hole was made.[30][31][32] The German, Australian, and French
governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially
vulnerable.[33][34]
In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and
other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The
vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows
XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000
Service Pack 4.[35]
The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public
domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing
tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing
web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. "The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility
of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability," said George Kurtz, CTO
of McAfee, of the attack. "The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft
attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems."[36]

Security company Websense said it identified "limited public use" of the unpatched IE
vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites.[37]
According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went
public last week. "Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to
the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the
possibility of widespread attacks," said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee,
in a blog update.[38] Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified
additional sites using the exploit on January 19.[39] According to reports from Ahnlab, the
second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a
popular IM client in South Korea.[39]
Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7
(IE7) and IE8—even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution
Prevention (DEP)) is turned on. According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability
researcher, "even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP
Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the
version Microsoft shipped in January 2007."[40]
Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September.
[22] Work on an update was prioritized[41] and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft
released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on
it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities.[42] They did not state if any of
the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular
relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for
most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.
Security researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm,
released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that
might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese
language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.[43]
On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has
claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks
made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also
tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools,
Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School.[44] As highlighted by The
New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a
rival of Google China.[45] Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied
the allegation.[46][47]
In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified
Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the
world.[48]
