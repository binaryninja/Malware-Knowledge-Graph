In February 2017 an article in the Polish media broke the silence on a long-running story
about attacks on banks, allegedly related to the notoriously known Lazarus Group. While the
original article didn’t mention Lazarus Group it was quickly picked up by security
researchers. Today we’d like to share some of our findings, and add something new to
what’s currently common knowledge about Lazarus Group activities, and their connection to
the much talked about February 2016 incident, when an unknown attacker attempted to steal
up to $851M USD from Bangladesh Central Bank.
Since the Bangladesh incident there have been just a few articles explaining the connection
between Lazarus Group and the Bangladesh bank heist. One such publication was made
available by BAE systems in May 2016, however it only included analysis of the wiper code.
This was followed by another blogpost by Anomali Labs, confirming the same wiping code
similarity. This similarity was found to be satisfying to many readers, however at Kaspersky
Lab, we were looking for a stronger connection.

Other claims that Lazarus was the group behind attacks on the Polish financial sector, came
from Symantec in 2017, which noticed string reuse in malware at one of their Polish
customers. Symantec also confirmed seeing the Lazarus wiper tool in Poland at one of their
customers. However, from this it’s only clear that Lazarus might have attacked Polish banks.

While all these facts are fascinating, the connection between Lazarus attacks on banks, and
their role in attacks on banks’ systems, was still loose. The only case where specific malware
targeting the bank’s infrastructure used to connect to SWIFT messaging server was
discovered, is the Bangladesh Central Bank case. However, while almost everybody in the
security industry has heard about the attack, few technical details have been revealed to the
public based on the investigation that took place on site at the attacked company.
Considering that the afterhack publications by the media mentioned that the investigation
stumbled upon three different attackers, it was not obvious whether Lazarus was the one
responsible for the fraudulent SWIFT transactions, or if Lazarus had in fact developed its
own malware to attack banks’ systems.
We would like to add some strong facts that link some attacks on banks to Lazarus, and
share some of our own findings as well as shed some light on the recent TTPs used by the
attacker, including some yet unpublished details from the attack in Europe in 2017.
This is the first time we announce some Lazarus Group operations that have thus far gone
unreported to the public. We have had the privilege of investigating these attacks and
helping with incident response at a number of financial institutions in South East Asia and
Europe. With cooperation and support from our research partners, we have managed to

address many important questions about the mystery of Lazarus attacks, such as their
infiltration method, their relation to attacks on SWIFT software and, most importantly, shed
some light on attribution.

Lazarus attacks are not a local problem and clearly the group’s operations span across the
whole world. We have seen the detection of their infiltration tools in multiple countries in the
past year. Lazarus was previously known to conduct cyberespionage and cybersabotage
activities, such as attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment with volumes of internal data
leaked, and many system harddrives in the company wiped. Their interest in financial gain is
relatively new, considering the age of the group, and it seems that they have a different set of
people working on the problems of invisible money theft or the generation of illegal profit. We
believe that Lazarus Group is very large and works mainly on infiltration and espionage
operations, while a substantially smaller units within the group, which we have dubbed
Bluenoroff, is responsible for financial profit.
The watering hole attack on Polish banks was very well covered by media, however not
everyone knows that it was one of many. Lazarus managed to inject malicious code in many
other locations. We believe they started this watering hole campaign at the end of 2016 after
their other operation was interrupted in South East Asia. Lazarus/Bluenoroff regrouped and
rushed into new countries, selecting mostly poorer and less developed locations, hitting
smaller banks because they are, apparently, easy prey.
To date, we’ve seen Bluenoroff attack four main types of targets:

Financial institutions
Casinos
Companies involved in the development of financial trade software
Crypto-currency businesses
Here is the full list of countries where we have seen Bluenoroff watering hole attacks:
Mexico
Australia
Uruguay
Russian Federation
Norway
India
Nigeria
Peru
Poland
Of course, not all attacks were as successful as the Polish attack case, mainly because in
Poland they managed to compromise a government website. This website was frequently
accessed by many financial institutions making it a very powerful attack vector. Nevertheless,
this wave of attacks resulted in multiple infections across the world, adding new hits to the
map we’ve been building.

One of the most interesting discoveries about Lazarus/Bluenoroff came from one of our
research partners who completed a forensic analysis of a C2 server in Europe used by the
group. Based on the forensic analysis report, the attacker connected to the server via
Terminal Services and manually installed an Apache Tomcat server using a local browser,
configured it with Java Server Pages and uploaded the JSP script for C2. Once the server
was ready, the attacker started testing it. First with a browser, then by running test instances
of their backdoor. The operator used multiple IPs: from France to Korea, connecting via
proxies and VPN servers. However, one short connection was made from a very unusual IP
range, which originates in North Korea.

In addition, the operator installed an off-the-shelf cryptocurrency mining software that should
generate Monero cryptocoins. The software so intensely consumed system resources that
the system became unresponsive and froze. This could be the reason why it was not
properly cleaned, and the server logs were preserved.
This is the first time we have seen a direct link between Bluenoroff and North Korea. Their
activity spans from backdoors to watering hole attacks, and attacks on SWIFT servers in
banks of South East Asia and Bangladesh Central Bank. Now, is it North Korea behind all
the Bluenoroff attacks after all? As researchers, we prefer to provide facts rather than
speculations. Still, seeing IP in the C2 log, does make North Korea a key part of the Lazarus
Bluenoroff equation.

Conclusions
Lazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking. It has
been on a spike since 2011 and activities didn’t disappear after Novetta published the results
of its Operation Blockbuster research, in which we also participated. All those hundreds of
samples that were collected give the impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of
malware, which produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors.
We have seen them using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting their own
algorithms, applying commercial software protectors, and using their own and underground
packers. Lazarus knows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary
backdoors being pushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn’t impact the
group too much. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection they
start deploying more advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk.
The code is wrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container, or maybe hidden

6/9

in a binary encrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only attackers can
use, because they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems – be it a public
sandbox or a researcher’s environment – will never see the real payload.
Most of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new
generation as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be newer, and newer, and newer
versions. Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, same code, and the same algorithms.
“Keep morphing!” seems to be their internal motto. Those rare cases when they are caught
with same tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one
part doesn’t always know what the other is doing.
This level of sophistication is something that is not generally found in the cybercriminal world.
It’s something that requires strict organisation and control at all stages of operation. That’s
why we think that Lazarus is not just another APT actor.
Of course such processes require a lot of money to keep running, which is why the
appearance of the Bluenoroff subgroup within Lazarus was logical.
Bluenoroff, being a subgroup of Lazarus, is focusing on financial attacks only. This subgroup
has reverse engineering skills because they spend time tearing apart legitimate software,
and implementing patches for SWIFT Alliance software, in attempts to find ways to steal big
money. Their malware is different and they aren’t exactly soldiers that hit and run. Instead,
they prefer to make an execution trace to reconstruct and quickly debug the problem. They
are field engineers that come when the ground is already cleared after conquering new
lands.
One of Bluenoroff’s favorite strategies is to silently integrate into running processes without
breaking them. From the code we’ve seen, it looks as if they are not exactly looking for a hit
and run solution when it comes to money theft. Their solutions are aimed at invisible theft
without leaving a trace. Of course, attempts to move around millions of USD can hardly
remain unnoticed, but we believe that their malware might be secretly deployed now in many
other places and it isn’t triggering any serious alarms because it’s much more quiet.
We would like to note, that in all of the observed attacks against banks that we have
analyzed, SWIFT software solutions running on banks’ servers haven’t demonstrated or
exposed any specific vulnerability. The attacks were focused on banking infrastructure and
staff, exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing
passwords, using keyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the way banks use servers
with SWIFT software installed requires personnel responsible for the administration and
operation. Sooner or later, the attackers find these personnel, gain the necessary privileges,
and access the server connected to the SWIFT messaging platform. With administrative
access to the platform they can manipulate software running on the system as they wish.
There is not much that can stop them, because from a technical perspective, their activities
may not differ from what an authorized and qualified engineer would do: starting and
7/9

stopping services, patching software, modifying the database. Therefore, in all the breaches
we have analyzed, SWIFT, as an organization has not been at direct fault. More than that,
we have witnessed SWIFT trying to protect its customers by implementing the detection of
database and software integrity issues. We believe that this is a step in the right direction
and these activities should be extended with full support. Complicating the patches of
integrity checks further may create a serious threat to the success of future operations run by
Lazarus/Bluenoroff against banks worldwide.
To date, the Lazarus/Bluenoroff group has been one of the most successful in launching
large scale operations against the financial industry. We believe that they will remain one of
the biggest threats to the banking sector, finance and trading companies, as well as casinos
for the next few years. We would like to note that none of the financial institutions we helped
with incident response and investigation reported any financial loss.
As usual, defense against attacks such as those from Lazarus/Bluenoroff should include a
multi-layered approach. Kaspersky products include special mitigation strategies against this
group, as well as the many other APT groups we track. If you are interested in reading more
