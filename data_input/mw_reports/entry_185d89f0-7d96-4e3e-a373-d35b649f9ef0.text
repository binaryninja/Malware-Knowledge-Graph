Olympic Destroyer is still alive

By GReAT

In March 2018 we published our research on Olympic Destroyer, an advanced threat actor that
hit organizers, suppliers and partners of the Winter Olympic Games 2018 held in
Pyeongchang, South Korea. Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the
spread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance
and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and selfmodifying destructive malware.
We have previously emphasized that the story of Olympic Destroyer is different to that of other
threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that,
the attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare
attribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated
signatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus
APT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader,
we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.
The deceptive behavior of Olympic Destroyer, and its excessive use of various false flags,
which tricked many researchers in the infosecurity industry, got our attention. Based on
malware similarity, the Olympic Destroyer malware was linked by other researchers to three
Chinese speaking APT actors and the allegedly North Korean Lazarus APT; some code had
hints of the EternalRomance exploit, while other code was similar to the Netya
(Expetr/NotPetya) and BadRabbit targeted ransomware. Kaspersky Lab managed to find
lateral movement tools and initial infection backdoors, and has followed the infrastructure used
to control Olympic Destroyer in one of its South Korean victims.
Some of the TTPs and operational security used by Olympic Destroyer bear a certain
resemblance to Sofacy APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is
much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the
actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However,
it is important to remember that Olympic Destroyer can be considered a master in the use of
false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.
We decided to keep tracking the group and set our virtual ‘nets’ to catch Olympic Destroyer
again if it showed up with a similar arsenal. To our surprise it has recently resurfaced with new
activity.
In May-June 2018 we discovered new spear-phishing documents that closely resembled
weaponized documents used by Olympic Destroyer in the past. This and other TTPs led us to
believe that we were looking at the same actor again. However, this time the attacker has new
targets. According to our telemetry and the characteristics of the analyzed spear-phishing
documents, we believe the attackers behind Olympic Destroyer are now targeting financial
1/14

organizations in Russia, and biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe
and Ukraine. They continue to use a non-binary executable infection vector and obfuscated
scripts to evade detection.

Simplified infection procedure

Infection Analysis
In reality the infection procedure is a bit more complex and relies on multiple different
technologies, mixing VBA code, Powershell, MS HTA, with JScript inside and more
Powershell. Let’s take a look at this more closely to let incident responders and security
researchers recognize such an attack at any time in the future.
One of the recent documents that we discovered had the following properties:
MD5: 0e7b32d23fbd6d62a593c234bafa2311
SHA1: ff59cb2b4a198d1e6438e020bb11602bd7d2510d
File Type: Microsoft Office Word
Last saved date: 2018-05-14 15:32:17 (GMT)
Known file name: Spiez CONVERGENCE.doc
The embedded macro is heavily obfuscated. It has a randomly-generated variable and function
name.

Obfuscated VBA macro

Its purpose is to execute a Powershell command. This VBA code was obfuscated with the
same technique used in the original Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing campaign.
It starts a new obfuscated Powershell scriptlet via the command line. The obfuscator is using
array-based rearranging to mutate original code, and protects all commands and strings such
as the command and control (C2) server address.
There is one known obfuscation tool used to produce such an effect: Invoke-Obfuscation.

Obfuscated commandline Powershell scriptlet

This script disables Powershell script logging to avoid leaving traces:

It has an inline implementation of the RC4 routine in Powershell, which is used to decrypt
additional payload downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive. The decryption relies on a hardcoded
32-byte ASCII hexadecimal alphabet key. This is a familiar technique used in other Olympic
Destroyer spear-phishing documents in the past and in Powershell backdoors found in the
infrastructure of Olympic Destroyer’s victims located in Pyeongchang.

The second stage payload downloaded is an HTA file that also executes a Powershell script.

Downloaded access.log.txt

This file has a similar structure to the Powershell script executed by the macro in spearphishing attachments. After deobfuscating it, we can see that this script also disables
Powershell logging and downloads the next stage payload from the same server address. It
also uses RC4 with a pre-defined key:

The final payload is the Powershell Empire agent. Below we partially provide the http stager
scriptlet for the downloaded Empire agent.

Powershell Empire is a post-exploitation free and open-source framework written in Python
and Powershell that allows fileless control of the compromised hosts, has modular architecture
and relies on encrypted communication. This framework is widely used by penetration-testing
companies in legitimate security tests for lateral movement and information gathering.

Infrastructure
We believe that the attackers used compromised legitimate web servers for hosting and
controlling malware. Based on our analysis, the URI path of discovered C2 servers included
the following paths:
/components/com_tags/views
/components/com_tags/views/admin
/components/com_tags/controllers
/components/com_finder/helpers
/components/com_finder/views/
/components/com_j2xml/
/components/com_contact/controllers/
5/14

These are known directory structures used by a popular open source content management
system, Joomla:

Unfortunately we don’t know what exact vulnerability was exploited in the Joomla CMS. What
is known is that one of the payload hosting servers used Joomla v1.7.3, which is an extremely
old version of this software, released in November 2011.

Victims and Targets
Based on several target profiles and limited victim reports, we believe that the recent operation
by Olympic Destroyer targets Russia, Ukraine and several other European countries.
According to our telemetry, several victims are entities from the financial sector in Russia. In
addition, almost all the samples we found were uploaded to a multi-scanner service from
European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and France, as well as from Ukraine
and Russia.

Location of targets in recent Olympic Destroyer attacks

Since our visibility is limited, we can only speculate about the potential targets based on the
profiles suggested by the content of selected decoy documents, email subjects or even file
names picked by the attackers.
One such decoy document grabbed our attention. It referred to ‘Spiez Convergence’, a biochemical threat research conference held in Switzerland, organized by SPIEZ LABORATORY,
which not long ago was involved in the Salisbury attack investigation.

Another decoy document observed in the attacks (‘Investigation_file.doc’) references the nerve
agent used to poison Sergey Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury:

Some other spear-phishing documents include words in the Russian and German language in
their names:
9bc365a16c63f25dfddcbe11da042974 Korporativ.doc
da93e6651c5ba3e3e96f4ae2dd763d94 Korporativ_2018.doc
e2e102291d259f054625cc85318b7ef5 E-Mail-Adressliste_2018.doc
9/14

One of the documents included a lure image with perfect Russian language in it.

A message in Russian encouraging the user to enable macro (54b06b05b6b92a8f2ff02fdf47baad0e)

One of the most recent weaponized documents was uploaded to a malware scanning service
from Ukraine in a file named ‘nakaz.zip’, containing ‘nakaz.doc’ (translated as ‘order.doc’ from
Ukrainian).

Another lure message to encourage the user to enable macro

According to metadata, the document was edited on June 14th. The Cyrillic messages inside
this and previous documents are in perfect Russian, suggesting that it was probably prepared
with the help of a native speaker and not automated translation software.
Once the user enables macro, a decoy document is displayed, taken very recently from a
Ukrainian state organization (the date inside indicates 11 June 2018). The text of the
document is identical to the one on the official website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health.

Further analysis of other related files suggest that the target of this document is working in the
biological and epizootic threat prevention field.

Attribution
Although not comprehensive, the following findings can serve as a hint to those looking for a
better connection between this campaign and previous Olympic Destroyer activity. More
information on overlaps and reliable tracking of Olympic Destroyer attacks is available to
subscribers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Services (see below).

Similar obfuscated macro structure

The documents above show apparent structural similarity as if they were produced by the
same tool and obfuscator. The highlighted function name in the new wave of attacks isn’t in
fact new. While being uncommon, a function named “MultiPage1_Layout” was also found in
the Olympic Destroyer spear phishing document (MD5:
5ba7ec869c7157efc1e52f5157705867).

Same MultiPage1_Layout function name used in older campaign

Conclusions
Despite initial expectations for it to stay low or even disappear, Olympic Destroyer has
resurfaced with new attacks in Europe, Russia and Ukraine. In late 2017, a similar
reconnaissance stage preceded a larger cyber-sabotage stage meant to destroy and paralyze
infrastructure of the Winter Olympic Games as well as related supply chains, partners and
12/14

even venues at the event location. It’s possible that in this case we have observed a
reconnaissance stage that will be followed by a wave of destructive attacks with new motives.
That is why it is important for all bio-chemical threat prevention and research companies and
organizations in Europe to strengthen their security and run unscheduled security audits.
The variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was
used by several groups with different interests – i.e. a group primarily interested in financial
gain through cybertheft and another group or groups looking for espionage targets. This could
also be a result of cyberattack outsourcing, which is not uncommon among nation state actors.
On the other hand, the financial targets might be another false flag operation by an actor who
has already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect researchers’
attention.
Certain conclusions could be made based on motives and the selection of targets in this
campaign. However, it is easy to make a mistake when trying to answer the question of who is
behind this campaign with only the fragments of the picture that are visible to researchers. The
appearance, at the start of this year, of Olympic Destroyer with its sophisticated deception
efforts, changed the attribution game forever. We believe that it is no longer possible to draw
conclusions based on few attribution vectors discovered during regular investigation. The
resistance to and deterrence of threats such as Olympic Destroyer should be based on
cooperation between the private sector and governments across national borders.
Unfortunately, the current geopolitical situation in the world only boosts the global
segmentation of the internet and introduces many obstacles for researchers and investigators.
This will encourage APT attackers to continue marching into the protected networks of foreign
governments and commercial companies.
The best thing we can do as researchers is to keep tracking threats like this. We will keep
monitoring Olympic Destroyer and report on new discovered activities of this group.
