For more than four years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky
has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity.
The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative
snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT
reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel
people should be aware of.
This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2021.
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more
information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.

The most remarkable findings
Investigating the recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities we and our colleagues from
AMR found an attacker deploying a previously unknown backdoor, “FourteenHi”, in a
campaign that we dubbed ExCone, active since mid-March. During our investigation we
revealed multiple tools and variants of FourteenHi, configured with infrastructure that

FireEye reported as being related to the UNC2643 activity cluster. Moreover, we saw
ShadowPad detections coincide with FourteenHi variant infections, possibly hinting at a
shared operator between these two malware families.
FourteenHi abuses the popular VLC media player to execute its loader. It is capable of
performing basic backdoor functions. Further investigation also revealed scripts used by
the actor to gain situational awareness post-exploitation, as well as previous use of the
infrastructure to operate Cobalt Strike Beacon.
Although we couldn’t directly attribute this activity to any known threat actor, we found
older, highly similar 64-bit samples of the backdoor used in close proximity with
ShadowPad malware, mostly known for its operations involving supply-chain attacks as
an infection vector. Notably, we also found one C2 IP used in a 64-bit sample reportedly
used in the UNC2643 activity set, associated with the HAFNIUM threat actor, also using
Cobalt Strike, DLL side-loading and exploiting the same Exchange vulnerabilities.

Russian-speaking activity
On May 27 and 28, details regarding an ongoing email campaign against diplomatic
entities throughout Europe and North America were released by Volexity and Microsoft.
These attacks were attributed to Nobelium and APT29 by Microsoft and Volexity
respectively. While we were able to verify the malware and possible targeting for this
cluster of activity, we haven’t been able to make a definitive assessment at this time about
which threat actor is responsible, although we found ties to Kazuar. We have designated it
as a new threat actor and named it “HotCousin”. The attacks began with a spear-phishing
email which led to an ISO file container being stored on disk and mounted. From here,
the victim was presented with a LNK file made to look like a folder within an Explorer
window. If the victim double clicked on it, the LNK then executed a loader written in
.NET referred to as BoomBox, or a DLL. The execution chain ultimately ended with a
Cobalt Strike beacon payload being loaded into memory. According to public blogs,
targeting was widespread but focused primarily on diplomatic entities throughout Europe
and North America: based on the content of the lure documents bundled with the
malware, this assessment appears to be accurate. This cluster of activity was conducted
methodically beginning in January with selective targeting and slow operational pace,
then ramping up and ending in May. There are indications of previous activity from this
threat actor dating back to at least October 2020, based on other Cobalt Strike payloads
and loaders bearing similar toolmarks.

Chinese-speaking activity
While investigating a recent rise of attacks against Exchange servers, we noticed a
recurring cluster of activity that appeared in several distinct compromised networks. This
cluster stood out because it used a formerly unknown Windows kernel mode rootkit and a
sophisticated multi-stage malware framework aimed at providing remote control over the
attacked servers. The former is used to hide the user mode malware’s artefacts from

investigators and security solutions, while demonstrating an interesting loading scheme
involving the kernel mode component of an open source project named “Cheat Engine” to
bypass the Windows Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism. We were able to
determine that this toolset had been in use from as early as July 2020; and that the threat
actor was mostly focused on Southeast Asian targets, including several governmental
entities and telecoms companies. Since this was a long-standing operation, with highprofile victims, an advanced toolset and no affinity to a known threat actor, we decided to
name the underlying cluster “GhostEmperor”.
APT31 (aka ZIRCONIUM) is a Chinese-speaking intrusion set. This threat actor set up an
ORB (Operational Relay Boxes) infrastructure, composed of several compromised SOHO
routers, to target entities based in Europe (and perhaps elsewhere). As of the publication
of our report in May, we had seen these ORBs used to relay Cobalt Strike communications
and for anonymization proxying purposes. It is likely that APT31 uses them for other
implants and ends as well (for example, exploit or malware staging). Most of the
infrastructure put in place by APT31 comprises compromised Pakedge routers (RK1, RE1
and RE2). This little-known constructor specializes in small enterprise routers and
network devices. So far, we don’t know which specific vulnerability has been exploited by
the intrusion set to compromise the routers. Nor do we currently possess telemetry that
would provide further visibility into this campaign. We will, of course, continue to track
these activities.
Following our previous report on EdwardsPheasant, DomainTools and BitDefender
published articles about malicious activities against targets in Southeast Asia which we
believe, with medium to high confidence, are parts of EdwardsPheasant campaigns.
While tracking the activities of this threat actor, analyzing samples discovered or
provided by third parties, and investigating from public IoCs, we discovered an updated
DropPhone implant, an additional implant loaded by FoundCore’s shellcode, several
possible new infection documents and malicious domain names, as well as additional
targets. While we do not believe we have a complete picture of this set of activities yet, our
report this quarter marks a significant step further in understanding its extent.
A Chinese-speaking APT compromised a certificate authority in Mongolia and replaced
digital certificate management client software with a malicious downloader in February.
We are tracking this group as BountyGlad. Related infrastructure was identified and used
in multiple other incidents: interesting related activity included server-side attacks on
WebSphere and WebLogic services in Hong Kong; and on the client-side, Trojanized
Flash Player installers. The group demonstrated an increase in strategic sophistication
with this supply-chain attack. While replacing a legitimate installer on a high value
website like a certificate authority requires a medium level of skill and coordination, the
technical sophistication is not on par with ShadowHammer. And while the group deploys
fairly interesting, but simplistic, steganography to cloak its shellcode, we think it was
probably generated with code that has been publicly available for years. Previous activity
also connected with this group relied heavily on spear-phishing and Cobalt Strike
throughout 2020. Some activity involved PowerShell commands and loader variants

different from the downloaders presented in our recent report. In addition to spearphishing, the group appears to rely on publicly available exploits to penetrate unpatched
target systems. They use implants and C2 (Command and Control) code that are a mix of
both publicly available and privately shared across multiple Chinese-speaking APTs. We
are able to connect infrastructure across multiple incidents. Some of those were focused
on Western targets in 2020. Some of the infrastructure listed in an FBI Flash alert
published in May 2020, targeting US organizations conducting COVID-19 research, was
also used by BountyGlad.
While investigating users infected with the TPCon backdoor, previously discussed in a
private report, we detected loaders which are part of a new multi-plugin malware
framework that we named “QSC”, which allows attackers to load and run plugins inmemory. We attribute the use of this framework to Chinese-speaking groups, based on
some overlaps in victimology and infrastructure with other known tools used by these
groups. We have so far observed the malware loading a Command shell and File Manager
plugins in-memory. We believe the framework has been used in the wild since April 2020,
based on the compilation timestamp of the oldest sample found. However, our telemetry
suggests that the framework is still in use: the latest activity we detected was in March
this year.
Earlier this month, Rostelecom Solar and NCIRCC issued a joint public report describing
a series of attacks against networks of government entities in Russia. The report
described a formerly unknown actor leveraging an infection chain that leads to the
deployment of two implants – WebDav-O and Mail-O. Those, in conjunction with other
post-exploitation activity, have led to network-wide infections in the targeted
organizations that resulted in exfiltration of sensitive data. We were able to trace the
WebDav-O implant’s activity in our telemetry to at least 2018, indicating government
affiliated targets based in Belarus. Based on our investigation, we were able to find
additional variants of the malware and observe some of the commands executed by the
attackers on the compromised machines.
We discovered a cluster of activity targeting telecom operators within a specific region.
The bulk of this activity took place from May to October 2020. This activity made use of
several malware families and tools; but the infrastructure, a staging directory, and incountry target profiles tie them together. The actors deployed a previously unknown
passive backdoor, that we call “TPCon”, as a primary implant. It was later used to perform
both reconnaissance within target organizations and to deploy a post-compromise toolset
made up mostly of publicly available tools. We also found other previously unknown
active backdoors, that we call “evsroin”, used as secondary implants. Another interesting
find was a related loader (found in a staging directory) that loaded a KABA1 implant
variant. KABA1 was an implant used against targets throughout the South China Sea that
we attributed to the Naikon APT back in 2016. On another note, on the affected hosts we
found additional multiple malware families shared by Chinese-speaking actors, such as
ShadowPad and Quarian backdoors. These did not seem to be directly connected to the
TPCon/evsroin incidents because the supporting infrastructure appeared to be

completely separate. One of the ShadowPad samples appears to have been detected in
2020, while the others were detected well before that, in 2019. Besides the Naikon tie, we
found some overlaps with previously reported IceFog and IamTheKing activities.

Middle East
BlackShadow is a threat group that became known after exfiltrating sensitive documents
from Shirbit, an Israeli insurance company, and demanding a ransom in exchange for not
releasing the information in its possession. Since then, the group has made more
headlines, breaching another company in Israel and publishing a trove of documents
containing customer related information on Telegram. Following this, we found several
samples of the group’s unique .NET backdoor in our telemetry that were formerly
unknown to us, one of which was recently detected in Saudi Arabia. By pivoting on new
infrastructure indicators that we observed in those samples, we were able to find a
particular C2 server that was contacted by a malicious Android implant and shows ties to
the group’s activity.
We previously covered a WildPressure campaign against targets in the Middle East .
Keeping track of the threat actor’s malware this spring, we were able to find a newer
version (1.6.1) of their C++ Trojan, a corresponding VBScript variant with the same
version and a completely new set of modules, including an orchestrator and three plugins.
This confirms our previous assumption that there are more last-stagers besides the C++
ones, based on one of the fields in the C2 communication protocol which contains the
“client” programming language. Another language used by WildPressure is Python. The
PyInstaller module for Windows contains a script named “Guard”. Perhaps the most
interesting finding here is that this malware was developed for both Windows and macOS
operating systems. In this case, the hardcoded version is 2.2.1. The coding style, overall
design and C2 communication protocol is quite recognisable across all programming
languages used by the attackers. The malware used by WildPressure is still under active
development in terms of versions and programming languages in use. Although we could
not associate WildPressure’s activity with other threat actors, we did find minor
similarities in the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) used by BlackShadow,
which is also active in the same region. However, we consider that these similarities serve
as minor ties and are not enough to make any attribution.
We discovered an ongoing campaign that we attribute to an actor named WIRTE,
beginning in late 2019, targeting multiple sectors, focused on the Middle East. WIRTE is
a lesser-known threat actor first publicly referenced in 2019, which we suspect has
relations with the Gaza Cybergang threat actor group. During our hunting efforts, in
February, for threat actor groups that are using VBS/VBA implants, we came across MS
Excel droppers that use hidden spreadsheets and VBA macros to drop their first stage
implant – a VBS script. The VBS script’s main function is to collect system information
and execute arbitrary code sent by the attackers. Although we recently reported on a new
Muddywater first stage VBS implant used for reconnaissance and profiling activities,
these intrusion sets have slightly different TTPs and wider targeting. To date, we have

recorded victims focused in the Middle East and a few other countries outside this region.
Despite various industries being affected, the focus was mainly towards government and
diplomatic entities; however, we also noticed an unusual targeting of law firms.
GoldenJackal is the name we have given to a cluster of activity, recently discovered in our
telemetry, that has been active since November 2019. This intrusion set consists of a set
of .NET-based implants that are intended to control victim machines and exfiltrate
certain files from them, suggesting that the actor’s primary motivation is espionage.
Furthermore, the implants were found in a restricted set of machines associated with
diplomatic entities in the Middle East. Analysis of the aforementioned malware, as well as
the accompanied detection logs, portray a capable and moderately stealthy actor. This can
be substantiated by the successful foothold gained by the underlying actor in the few
organizations we came across, all the while keeping a low signature and ambiguous
footprint.

Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula
The ScarCruft group is a geo-political motivated APT group that usually attacks
government entities, diplomats and individuals associated with North Korean affairs.
Following our last report about this group, we had not seen its activities for almost a year.
However, we observed that ScarCruft compromised a North Korea-related news media
website in January, beginning a campaign that was active until March. The attackers
utilized the same exploit chains, CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2020-0986, also used in
Operation Powerfall. Based on the exploit code and infection scheme characteristics, we
suspect that Operation PowerFall has a connection with the ScarCruft group. The exploit
chain contains several stages of shellcode execution, finally deploying a Windows
executable payload in memory. We discovered several victims from South Korea and
Singapore. Besides this watering-hole attack, this group also used Windows executable
malware concealing its payload. This malware, dubbed “ATTACK-SYSTEM”, also used
multi-stage shellcode infection to deliver the same final payload named “BlueLight”.
BlueLight uses OneDrive for C2. Historically, ScarCruft malware, especially RokRat, took
advantage of personal cloud servers as C2 servers, such as pCloud, Box, Dropbox, and
Yandex.
In May 2020, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Taiwan published an
announcement about an attack targeting Taiwanese legislators. Based on their
information, an unknown attacker sent spear-phishing emails using a fake presidential
palace email account, delivering malware we dubbed “Palwan”. Palwan is malware
capable of performing basic backdoor functionality as well as downloading further
modules with additional capabilities. Analysing the malware, we discovered another
campaign, active in parallel, targeting Nepal. We also found two more waves of attacks
launched against Nepal in October 2020 and in January this year using Palwan malware
variants. We suspect that the targeted sector in Nepal is similar to the one reported by the

https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/

CIB of Taiwan. Investigating the infrastructure used in the Nepal campaigns, we spotted
an overlap with Dropping Elephant activity. However, we don’t deem this overlap
sufficient to attribute this activity to the Dropping Elephant threat actor.
BlueNoroff is a long-standing, financially motivated APT group that has been targeting
the financial industry for years. In recent operations, the group has focused on
cryptocurrency businesses. Since the publication of our research of BlueNoroff’s
“SnatchCrypto” campaign in 2020, the group’s strategy to deliver malware has evolved. In
this campaign, BlueNoroff used a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199, a
remote template injection vulnerability. The injected template contains a Visual Basic
script, which is responsible for decoding the next payload from the initial Word document
and injecting it into a legitimate process. The injected payload creates a persistent
backdoor on the victim’s machine. We observed several types of backdoor. For further
surveillance of the victim, the malware operator may also deploy additional tools.
BlueNoroff has notably set up fake blockchain, or cryptocurrency-related, company
websites for this campaign, to lure potential victims and initiate the infection process.
Numerous decoy documents were used, which contain business and nondisclosure
agreements as well as business introductions. When compared to the previous
SnatchCrypto campaign, the BlueNoroff group utilized a similar backdoor and PowerShell
agent but changed the initial infection vector. Windows shortcut files attached to spearphishing emails used to be the starting point for an infection: they have now been
replaced by weaponized Word documents.
We have discovered Andariel activity using a revised infection scheme and custom
ransomware targeting a broad spectrum of industries located in South Korea. In April, we
observed a suspicious document containing a Korean file name and decoy uploaded to
VirusTotal. It revealed a novel infection scheme and an unfamiliar payload. During the
course of our research, Malwarebytes published a report with technical details about the
same series of attacks, which attributed it to the Lazarus group. After a deep analysis we
reached a different conclusion – that the Andariel group was behind these attacks. Code
overlaps between the second stage payload in this campaign and previous malware from
the Andariel group allowed for this attribution. Apart from the code similarity and the
victimology, we found additional connections with the Andariel group. Each threat actor
has a characteristic habit when they interactively work with a backdoor shell in the postexploitation phase. The way Windows commands and their options were used in this
campaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity. The threat actor has been
spreading the third stage payload since the middle of 2020 and leveraged malicious Word
documents and files mimicking PDF documents as infection vectors. Notably, in addition
to the final backdoor, we discovered one victim infected with custom ransomware. This
ransomware adds another facet to this Andariel campaign, which also sought financial
profit in a previous operation involving the compromise of ATMs.
We recently uncovered a large-scale and highly active attack in Southeast Asia coming
from a threat actor we dubbed LuminousMoth. Further analysis revealed that this
malicious activity dates back to October 2020 and was still ongoing at the time we

https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/

7/12

APT trends report Q2 2021 | Securelist

reported it in June. LuminousMoth takes advantage of DLL sideloading to download and
execute a Cobalt Strike payload. However, perhaps the most interesting part of this attack
is its capability to spread to other hosts by infecting USB drives. In addition to the
malicious DLLs, the attackers also deployed a signed, but fake version of the popular
application Zoom on some infected systems, enabling them to exfiltrate files; and an
additional tool that accesses a victim’s Gmail session by stealing cookies from the Chrome
browser. Infrastructure ties as well as shared TTPs allude to a possible connection
between LuminousMoth and the HoneyMyte threat group, which was seen targeting the
same region and using similar tools in the past. Most early sightings of this activity were
in Myanmar, but it now appears that the attackers are much more active in the
Philippines, where the number of known attacks has grown more than tenfold. This raises
the question of whether this is caused by a rapid replication through removable devices or
by an unknown infection vector, such as a watering-hole focusing on the Philippines.
We recently reported SideCopy campaigns attacking the Windows platform together with
Android-based implants. These implants turned out to be multiple applications working
as information stealers to collect sensitive information from victims’ devices, such as
contact lists, SMS messages, call recordings, media and other types of data. Following up,
we discovered additional malicious Android applications, some of them purporting to be
known messaging apps like Signal or an adult chat platform. These newly discovered
applications use the Firebase messaging service as a channel to receive commands. The
operator is able to control if either Dropbox or another, hard coded server is used to
exfiltrate stolen files.

Other interesting discoveries
Expanding our research on the exploit targeting CVE-2021-1732, originally discovered by
DBAPPSecurity Threat Intelligence Center and used by the Bitter APT group, we
discovered another possible zero-day exploit used in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.
Interestingly, the exploit was found in the wild as part of a separate framework, alongside
CVE-2021-1732 as well as other previously patched exploits. We are highly confident that
this framework is entirely unrelated to Bitter APT and was used by a different threat
actor. Further analysis revealed that this Escalation of Privilege (EoP) exploit has
potentially been used in the wild since at least November 2020. Upon discovery, we
reported this new exploit to Microsoft in February. After confirmation that we were
indeed dealing with a new zero-day, it received the designation CVE-2021-28310.
Various marks and artifacts left in the exploit mean that we are also highly confident that
CVE-2021-1732 and CVE-2021-28310 were created by the same exploit developer that we
track as “Moses”. “Moses” appears to be an exploit developer who makes exploits
available to several threat actors, based on other past exploits and the actors observed
using them. To date, we have confirmed that at least two known threat actors have
utilized exploits originally developed by Moses: Bitter APT and Dark Hotel. Based on
similar marks and artifacts, as well as privately obtained information from third parties,
we believe at least six vulnerabilities observed in the wild in the last two years have

https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/

8/12

9/11/21, 8:29 PM

APT trends report Q2 2021 | Securelist

originated from “Moses”. While the EoP exploit was discovered in the wild, we are
currently unable to directly tie its usage to any known threat actor that we are currently
tracking. The EoP exploit was probably chained together with other browser exploits to
escape sandboxes and obtain system level privileges for further access. Unfortunately, we
weren’t able to capture a full exploit chain, so we don’t know if the exploit is used with
another browser zero-day, or coupled with exploits taking advantage of known, patched
vulnerabilities.
In another, more recent investigation into the surge of attacks by APT actors against
Exchange servers following the revelation of ProxyLogon and other Exchange
vulnerabilities, we took note of one unique cluster of activity. It attracted our attention
because the actor behind it seemed to have been active in compromising Exchange
servers since at least December 2020, all the while using a toolset that we were not able to
associate with any known threat group. During March, several waves of attacks on
Exchange servers were made public, partially describing the same cluster of activity that
we had observed. One of them, reported by ESET, contained an assessment that the actor
behind this activity had access to the Exchange exploits prior to their public release,
which aligns with our observations of the early activity of it last year. That said, none of
the public accounts described sightings of the full infection chain and later stages of
malware deployed as part of this group’s operation. Adopting the name Websiic, given
publicly to this cluster of activity by ESET, we reported the TTPs of the underlying threat
actor. Namely, we focused on the usage of both commodity tools like the China Chopper
webshell and a proprietary .NET backdoor used by the group, which we dubbed
“Samurai”, as well as describing a broader set of targets than the one documented thus
far.
On 15 April, Codecov publicly disclosed that its Bash Uploader script had been
compromised and was distributed to users between the 31 January and the 1 April. The
Bash Uploader script is publicly distributed by Codecov and aims to gather information
on the user’s execution environments, collect code coverage reports, and send them to the
Codecov infrastructure. As a result, this script compromise effectively constitutes a
supply-chain attack. The Bash uploader script is typically executed as a trusted resource
in development and testing environments (including as part of automated build
processes, such as continuous integration or development pipelines); and its compromise
could enable malicious access to infrastructure or account secrets, as well as code
repositories and source code. While we haven’t been able to confirm the malicious script
deployment, retrieve any information on the compromise goals, or identify further
associated malicious tools yet, we were able to collect one sample of a compromised Bash
uploader script, as well as identify some possibly associated additional malicious servers.
An e-mail sent by Click Studios to its customers on 22 April informed them that a
sophisticated threat actor had gained access to the Passwordstate automatic updating
functionality, referred to as the in-place upgrade. Passwordstate is a password
management tool for enterprises, and on 20 April, for a period of about 28 hours, a
malicious DLL was included in the software updates. On 24 April, an incident

https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/

9/12

9/11/21, 8:29 PM

APT trends report Q2 2021 | Securelist

management advisory was also released. The purpose of the campaign was to steal
passwords stored in the password manager. Although this attack was only active for a
short time, we managed to obtain the malicious DLLs and reported our initial findings.
Nevertheless, it’s still unclear how the attackers gained access to the Passwordstate
software to begin with. Following a new advisory published by Click Studio on 28 April,
we discovered a new variant of the malicious DLL used to backdoor the Passwordstate
password manager. This DLL variant was distributed in a phishing campaign, most likely
by the same actor.
A few days after April’s Patch Tuesday updates from Microsoft (13 April), a number of
suspicious files caught our attention. These files were binaries, disguised as “April 2021
Security Update Installers”. They were signed with a valid digital signature, delivering
Cobalt Strike beacon modules. It is likely that the modules were signed with a stolen
digital certificate. These Cobalt Strike beacon implants were configured with a hardcoded
C2, “code.microsoft.com”. Contrary to a (now redacted) publication from the Qihoo 360
team revolving around this activity, we can confirm that there was no compromise of
Microsoft’s infrastructure. In fact, an unauthorized party took over the dangling
subdomain “code.microsoft.com” and configured it to resolve to their Cobalt Strike host,
setup around 15 April. That domain hosted a Cobalt Strike beacon payload served to
HTTP clients using a specific and unique user agent. According to Microsoft and the
initial Qihoo notification, the impact in this case was very limited and didn’t affect
unsuspecting visitors to this website because of the required unique user agent.
On April 14-15, Kaspersky technologies detected a wave of highly targeted attacks against
multiple companies. Closer analysis revealed that all these attacks exploited a chain of
Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits. While we were not able to
retrieve the exploit used for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Chrome web-browser,
we were able to find and analyze an Escalation of Privilege (EoP) exploit used to escape
the sandbox and obtain system privileges. The EoP exploit was fine-tuned to work against
the latest and the most prominent builds of Windows 10 (17763 – RS5, 18362 – 19H1,
18363 – 19H2, 19041 – 20H1, 19042 – 20H2) and it exploits two distinct vulnerabilities
in the Microsoft Windows OS kernel. On April 20, we reported these vulnerabilities to
Microsoft and they assigned CVE-2021-31955 to the Information Disclosure vulnerability
and CVE-2021-31956 to the EoP vulnerability. Both vulnerabilities were patched on June
8, as a part of the June Patch Tuesday. The exploit-chain attempts to install malware in
the system through a dropper. The malware starts as a system service and loads the
payload, a “remote shell”-style backdoor which in turns connects to the C2 to get
commands. So far, we haven’t been able to find any connections or overlaps with a known
actor. Therefore, we are tentatively calling this cluster of activity PuzzleMaker.
On April 16, we began hearing rumors about active exploitation of Pulse Secure devices
from other researchers in the community. One day prior to this, the NSA, CISA, and FBI
had jointly published an advisory stating that APT29 was conducting widespread
scanning and exploitation of vulnerable systems, including Pulse Secure. For this reason,
initial thoughts were that the two were related; and these were just rumors circulating the

https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/

10/12

APT trends report Q2 2021 | Securelist

community about old activity that was being brought to light again. Following this, we
were able to at least confirm that the initial rumors were part of a separate set of activities
that had occurred between January and March and were not directly related to the
advisory mentioned above. This new activity involved the exploitation of at least two
vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure; one previously patched and one zero-day (CVE-202122893). We also became aware of affected organizations that were notified by a third
party that they were potentially compromised by this activity. After exploitation, the
threat actor proceeded to deploy a simple webshell to maintain persistence. On May 3,
Pulse Secure delivered “out-of-cycle” update and workaround packages to provide a
solution for the multiple vulnerabilities.
Cooperating with Check Point Research, we discovered an ongoing attack targeting a
small group of individuals in Xinjiang and Pakistan, in regions mostly populated by the
Uyghur minority. The attackers used malicious executables that collect information about
the infected system and attempt to download a second-stage payload. The actor put
considerable effort into disguising the payloads, whether by creating delivery documents
that appear to be originating from the United Nations using up-to-date related themes, or
by setting up websites for non-existing organizations claiming to fund charity groups. In
our report, we examined the flow of both infection vectors and provided our analysis of
the malicious artifacts we came across during this investigation, even though we were
unable to obtain the later stages of the infection chain.

Final thoughts
While the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on
social engineering as a means of gaining a foothold in a target organisation or
compromising an individual’s device, others refresh their toolsets and extend the scope of
their activities. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key
developments of APT groups.
Here are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2021:
We have reported several supply-chain attacks in recent months.. While some were
major and have attracted worldwide attention, we observed equally successful lowtech attacks, such as BountyGlad, CoughingDown and the attack targeting Codecov.
APT groups mainly use social engineering to gain an initial foothold in a target
network. However, we’ve seen a rise in APT threat actors leveraging exploits to gain
that initial foothold – including the zero-days developed by the exploit developer we
call “Moses” and those used in the PuzzleMaker, Pulse Secure attacks and the
Exchange server vulnerabilities.
APT threat actors typically refresh and update their toolsets: this includes not only
the inclusion of new platforms but also the use of additional languages as seen by
WildPressure’s macOS-supported Python malware.

APT trends report Q2 2021 | Securelist

As illustrated by the campaigns of various threat actors – including BountyGlad,
HotCousin, GoldenJackal, Scarcruft, Palwan, Pulse Secure and the threat actor
behind the WebDav-O/Mail-O implants – geo-politics continues to drive APT
developments.
As always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat
landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually
improve, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our
radar.
