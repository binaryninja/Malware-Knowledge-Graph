TA505 continues to show that as a cybercriminal group, they intend to wreak as much havoc while
maximizing potential proﬁts. Given the group’s active campaigns since our updates in June and July, we
continued following their latest campaigns. Just like in previous operations, they continue to make small
changes, such as targeting other countries, entities, or the combination of techniques used for deployment, for
each campaign.
Despite the changes, TA505 continues to use either FlawedAmmyy RAT (remote access trojan) or
ServHelper as payloads. However, over the last nine campaigns since our June report, they also started using
.ISO image attachments as the point of entry, as well as a .NET downloader, a new style for macro delivery, a
newer version of ServHelper, and a .DLL variant of FlawedAmmyy downloader. The group also started
targeting new countries, such as Turkey, Serbia, Romania, Korea, Canada, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
.ISO, enabled macros for entry dropping ServHelper or FlawedAmmyy
We noticed that the group became active again in the middle of July, targeting Turkish and Serbian banks
with emails that had .ISO ﬁle attachments as a means of entry. While the method is not new, the change in
ﬁle type may yield successful infections given the unusual malware delivery technique.
Emails with an attached .ISO image is an .LNK ﬁle that uses command line msiexec to execute an MSI ﬁle
from a URL such as hxxp://139[.]180[.]195[.]36/pm2.

The pm2 ﬁle contains and runs another executable, which is an installer ﬁle created using Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System (NSIS), a free script-driven installer authoring tool for Windows. This NSIS-encapsulated ﬁle
then installs ServHelper.

Figure 3. .LNK shortcut in .ISO ﬁle
In another sample we obtained, we found an Excel attachment with malicious macros embedded in the ﬁle.
The macros directly download the ﬁle created using NSIS installer from hxxp://45[.]67[.]229[.]36/p2, which
is the same binary we found in the .ISO and .LNK ﬁles that install ServHelper.

Figure 4. Email sample with an attached Excel ﬁle.
In another sample, the group made several updates with the versions of ServHelper, one of which included
the strings’ binary encrypted in Vigenère cipher.

Figure 5. Encrypted string
We observed that some of the samples still had errors in the cipher routine. In another routine that was
supposed to result in a stack overﬂow, it also displayed an error message. We suspect the developer of this
particular sample copied and pasted a stack overﬂow code.

Another updated version included encrypted contents of the C&C communication via HTTP (previous
versions had C&C request and response information in plain text). The encrypted sample — via XOR
encoding/URL encoding — also received a response from the C&C encrypted with XOR. The XOR key is
embedded in the binary; in this case, the key was “lol”.

Figure 7. XOR Encrypted C&C communication
We also found two new backdoor commands, runmem and runmemxor, that can run additional .DLL
commands in memory.
shell: Execute command
runmem: Download .DLL in memory and run
runmemxor: Download XOR encrypted .DLL and decrypt and run
zakr: Register autorun
slp: Set sleep time
load: Download executable ﬁle and run
loaddll: Download .DLL and run
selfkill: Uninstall itself

The newer version shows that the developers behind ServHelper continued to upgrade it to evade detection
and add more functions, possibly for even more iterations in the future.
In a campaign targeting thousands of Korean businesses, we found an .ISO attachment — used as the
malicious downloader — disguised as a conﬁrmed ﬂight ticket from a popular airline.

In a slightly different technique still targeting Korean enterprises, the .ISO ﬁles either contained an .LNK ﬁle
such as the previous iteration, or a .NET-compiled downloader.

Figure 9. Infection chains for FlawedAmmyy installation

Figure 10. Screenshot of decompiled script from the .ISO ﬁle with a .NET downloader embedded in the eticket.
Other samples also included an Excel ﬁle attachment with malicious macros that install FlawedAmmyy, or a
URL included in the email that supposedly downloads the ﬁle needed to download the malware.

Figure 11. .LNK embedded in the .ISO ﬁle
Both versions tried to download and execute ﬁles km1 or km2, an .MSI installer that executes the
FlawedAmmyy downloader. This, in turn, downloads an RC4-encrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT payload from
hxxp://92[.]38[.]135[.]67/2.dat or hxxp://27[.]102[.]70[.]196/1.dat that automatically decrypts and executes
the malware. This was also previously documented by an ESET security researcher.

On the samples that used a URL in the email content, we also noticed that the type of document ﬁle that it
downloaded depended on the URL that the user opened. Opening the documents will enable the macros and
download the same FlawedAmmyy downloader as the .ISO ﬁle iteration from
hxxp://92[.]38[.]135[.]67 or hxxp://27[.]102[.]70[.]196, with ﬁlenames k1 or k2.
In a campaign that targeted Romanian banks, emails used the subject “Fw: copie COC L5H3” and came with
an .ISO image attachment.

Figure 12. Infection chains for ServHelper installation with .NET downloader
Further analysis revealed a .NET downloader embedded in the image, along with routines that were almost
similar to those used in the campaign observed targeting Turkish banks. The .NET downloads jm1 — an .MSI
installer — that installs another NSIS installer, leading to a ServHelper infection in the system.

Figure 13. The decompiled .NET downloader
In another routine, an Excel ﬁle attachment downloads the NSIS installer once the user enables the malicious
macros from hxxp://109[.]234[.]37[.]15:80/j1 or hxxp://169[.]239[.]128[.]170/j1. Both URLs contain the
same binaries as the ones that the jm1 ﬁle installs.
More typical TA505 campaigns, with old and new targets
The group’s more typical payload and routine involves the use of ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT and
attaching a document embedded with malicious commands and strings. One variant targets Serbian banks
with subjects pertaining to “payments” or “invoices” applicable in several European languages. Enabling the
macros of the Excel ﬁle downloads a ﬁle created using NSIS installer with ServHelper from
79[.]141[.]168[.]105 or 195[.]123[.]213[.]126.
We found another routine from a campaign targeting government agencies in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar
with another type of .XLS or .DOC attachment. The emails used in these campaigns used subjects pertaining
to ﬁnance or urgent concerns on insurance policies.
A similar campaign targeting Turkish educational and government institutions used email subjects pertaining
to invoice information or personnel payroll, and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) .XLS or VBA .DOC
macros. Similar to the routine variant in Figure 6, the Excel VBA macros retrieve the FlawedAmmyy
downloader from hxxp://195[.]123[.]245[.]185/r1 or hxxp://185[.]225[.]17[.]5/r1, in then decrypts and

executes FlawedAmmyy RAT from hxxp://185[.]225[.]17[.]5/2.dat or hxxp://195[.]123[.]245[.]185/1.dat.
Meanwhile, the .DOC VBA macros retrieves the MSI ﬁles from hxxp://195.123.245.185/km or
hxxp://185.225.17.5/km, which executes the NSIS installer for ServHelper installation.
Similar to one of the routines depicted in Figure 9, the group also reused one of the email samples but
changed the targets to India and the United States, and added content referring to invoices. The email may
contain different documents, but the URLs for downloading ServHelper as the payload remain the same.

Figure 14. One of the more typical techniques employed by TA505.
.DLL downloaders that deliver FlawedAmmyy and newly styled macros
In the ﬁrst week of August, we noticed the group using a different approach and style to fetch the
downloaders via macros. While FlawedAmmyy RAT was still the ﬁnal payload, the downloader was different
— this operation used a .DLL variant. This particular campaign targeted Canada with subjects asking for
conﬁrmation of numbers from the marketing department.

Figure 15. Infection chain with .DLL FlawedAmmyy downloader
The attached document asks the user to enable the macros, which creates an Internet Explorer object instance.
This loads a text ﬁle from a hardcoded website, wherein the content of the document ﬁle is parsed through
and the inner text of the document is loaded. Our analysis showed that this is likely done so the malicious ﬁle
can bypass some ﬁrewall rules, since the communication uses Internet Explorer.

Figure 16. Sample document with malicious macros.

Figure 17. Text ﬁle using Internet Explorer for communication to bypass ﬁrewall rules.
The downloaded ﬁle is a text ﬁle with a single number on each line. The macros process the downloaded
payload with each number encrypted in XOR with a constant hardcoded value of 106. The result is an
executable ﬁle written to the disc and executed.

Figure 18. Executable ﬁle written to disk and executed
The executed .DLL is packed using two layers: a custom packer for the ﬁrst stage and UPX (Ultimate Packer
for Executables) for the second stage. The unpacked payload in memory is also a .DLL — it’s the ﬁrst time
we’ve seen a FlawedAmmyy downloader as a .DLL. As we further analyzed the main behavior by
downloading the encrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT and decrypted it with RC4, we found that it was similar to
the previous campaigns, but with a few updates.
The ﬁrst update is the use of the socket API to send an HTTP request instead of wininet or winhttp API to
download an encrypted FlawedAmmyy, building an HTTP header by itself. This could likely be an effort to
bypass API hooking for HTTP.

Figure 19. Send HTTP request using socket API
The second change: The decrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT is now saved as dllhots.exe in C:\temp\ (it used to be
saved as wsus.exe). Lastly, this new FlawedAmmyy downloader overwrites some PE header members with
random values. Speciﬁcally, it overwrites the checksum, the address of relocation table in DOS header, and
the checksum in optional headers.

Figure 20. Original PE header members (left) vs. overwritten header members (right)
The decrypted FlawedAmmyy RAT slightly different from the one that TA505 reused over its past
campaigns. While the previous strings had the modiﬁed AmmyyAdmin binary since the source code was
leaked, TA505 changed the strings in this sample to PopssAdmin. This may bypass detection rules if the
systems’ lists were not updated.

Figure 21. Signiﬁcant changes in the binary
In another sample targeting South Korea, the difference with the previous case is the XOR encryption
hardcoded at 180. We also found that the ﬁle delivered is an .MSI executable containing the same .DLL

FlawedAmmyy downloader.
From the document embedded with the malicious macros, the macro code calls “Run” on the WScript.Shell
object. Most of the strings forming the ﬁnal command are stored in the “Tag” properties of a form embedded
in the document.

Figure 22. Sample document in Korean asking the user to enable the macros.

Figure 23. Final command strings in document’s “tag” properties.
The ﬁnal command executes the download and installation of the .MSI ﬁle into

From the parameters above, “/i” means install, “/q” means quiet. The other three parameters do not appear to
be used at all, as reported in the install log (by adding /L*V “C:\example.log” parameter). The .MSI ﬁle is a

downloader with the .DLL FlawedAmmyy downloader inside; it retrieves the ﬁnal payload, then decrypts and
executes FlawedAmmyy RAT.

Figure 25. Unused parameters from log
Around the second week of August, we found a campaign targeting banks in the Czech Republic with
subjects pertaining to credit and NAV transfer. Analysis of the samples revealed that the document and macro
style was similar to the Korean campaign that used.MSI ﬁles, but this campaign downloads from
hxxp://185[.]17[.]122[.]220/555.msi or hxxp://159[.]69[.]54[.]146/555.msi. This .MSI ﬁle delivers the NSISpacked ServHelper, and the binary shares the same C&C server as the campaign targeting Saudi Arabia,
Oman, Qatar, and Turkey.
Suspicious activity using ServHelper
A campaign targeting China spoofed FedEx-themed emails with subjects pertaining to delivery problems,
failures, or notiﬁcations. Instead of attachments, it had malicious URLs in the message content that lead to
the download of a malicious document named fedex.doc from hxxp://www.fedexdocs[.]top/fedex.doc or
hxxp://www.fedexdocs[.]icu/fedex.doc. The VBA macro in the document downloads an NSIS-packed
executable from hxxps://senddocs[.]icu/stelar.exe, which installs ServHelper.
However, while initial analysis of the macro it used made us believe that this was from TA505, the macros’
obfuscation and style turned out to be more similar to the ones described in this post, based on the code page,
senders, and fast ﬂux. This particular campaign did not match TA505’s technique. Thus we suspect that other
cybercriminals purchased or borrowed ServHelper from the underground market for this campaign.
Conclusion
A number of ServHelper samples can be found in the wild, but some do not appear to be attributed to TA505.
One such sample (reported by a researcher that used the Twitter handle James_inthe_box), delivered Remcos,
seemingly with a TA505 pattern. However, we think it may be more likely that ServHelper is sold to other
malicious actors and tested on possible targets. In the long run, as more changes are added to the malware,
this can make attribution to speciﬁc groups more difﬁcult.
The changes and adjustments that TA505 made from the original ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy routines
may indicate that the group is experimenting and testing to determine which forms of obfuscation can bypass
detections, resulting in more ﬁnancial returns. It’s also possible that the changes in target countries and
industries are driven by the group’s customers; targeting new victims and even returning to previously
targeted countries and organizations with new techniques. This also gives TA505 more data on which types
of ﬁles can be further used for detection evasion, or even to deter attribution.
Given the frequency of changes in routines and deployment from our previous articles, we can expect TA505
to come up with more methods for payload delivery, malware types, and combinations of previously used and
new routines. Further, as the malware is still being upgraded, more iterations can be expected in the future. If
not removed completely, malicious actors can still take control of computers, peripherals, sensitive
information, and proprietary data.
As they continue to target businesses in different sectors, we can expect TA505 to keep using phishing and
social engineering techniques to compromise systems. Enterprises are advised to strengthen their online
systems, especially email gateways. Enforce the principle of least privilege, as well as a patch management
and system update procedure to make sure the entire network is protected. Install redundant and multilayered
protection systems from the gateway to the endpoint that can detect and block malicious URLS, emails, and
attachments, as well as proactively monitor other possible attack vectors.
Enterprises can consider Trend Micro™ endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro Smart Protection
Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security. Both solutions can protect users and businesses from threats by
