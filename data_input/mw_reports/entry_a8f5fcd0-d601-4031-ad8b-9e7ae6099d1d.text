Quasar, Sobaken and Vermin: A deeper look into an ongoing espionage campaign

INTRODUCTION
Using remote access tools Quasar, Sobaken and Vermin, cybercriminals have been systematically spying
on Ukrainian government institutions and exfiltrating data from their systems. The threat actors, first
mentioned in a report from January 2018 and tracked by ESET since mid-2017, continue to develop new
versions of their stealthy malware.
In this white paper, we take a closer look at this ongoing campaign. We provide further details on the
malware used to compromise victims’ systems and on the payloads installed on compromised systems,
and describe the various methods the attackers use to distribute and target their malware while
avoiding detection.

ATTACKER PROFILE
Even though these threat actors don’t seem to possess advanced skills or access to 0-day vulnerabilities,
they have been quite successful in using social engineering to both distribute their malware and fly
under the radar for extended periods of time.
We were able to trace attacker activity back to October 2015; however, it is possible that the attackers
have been active even longer.
These attackers use three different .NET malware strains in their attacks – Quasar RAT, Sobaken (a RAT
derived from Quasar) and a custom-made RAT called Vermin. All three malware strains have been in
active use against different targets at the same time, they share some infrastructure and connect to the
same C&C servers. A possible explanation for using three parallel malware strains is that each strain is
developed independently.

VICTIMS
This malware cluster has been used to target Ukrainian government institutions as seen in Figure 1.
ESET’s telemetry shows a few hundred victims in different organizations and several hundred executable
files related to the campaign.

malicious components (Map data ©2018 Google, ORION-ME).

TIMELINE
Another way to look at telemetry data is in the form of a timeline, as in Figure 2.

Figure 2 // Timeline of these ongoing campaigns.

DISTRIBUTION METHODS
According to our telemetry, the attackers have been using email as the primary distribution channel for
all three strains of malware. They have been quite successful in using social engineering to lure victims
into downloading and executing the malware.
In most cases, filenames are in Ukrainian and refer to specific topics likely to be relevant to victims’
occupations.

Quasar, Sobaken and Vermin: A deeper look into an ongoing espionage campaign

Examples of such filenames:
• “ІНСТРУКЦІЯ з організації забезпечення військовослужбовців Збройних Сил України та членів їх
сімей” (roughly translates to “Directive on providing security for military personnel of Ukranian Army
and their family members”)
• “новий проекту наказу, призначення перевірки вилучення” – (translates to “A new draft of directive
regarding verification of seizure“)
• “Відділення забезпечення Дон ОВК. Збільшення ліміту” – (translates to “Purchasing department
Don OVK. Increase of credit limit”)
Along with the basic social engineering technique of making email attachments attractive to their
intended victims, three specific technical methods have been observed in use by these attackers. These
presumably further improve the effectiveness of these campaigns.
Method #1: Email attachments using Unicode right-to-left override in their filenames to obscure their
real extension. These are actually executable files using Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Acrobat Reader
icons to appear more trustworthy.
Example file name: As seen in Figure 3 “Перевезення твердого палива (дров) для забезпечення
опалювання_<<RLO>>xcod.scr” (translates to “Transport of firewood in order to provide heating”) will
be seen with what the unwary may take to be a .DOCX extension.

Figure 3 // Executable file disguised as a Word document.

Method #2: Email attachments disguised as RAR self-extracting archives.
Example: Email with the attachment “Наказ_МОУ_Додатки_до_Iнструкцii_440_ост.rar” (Translation “Order of Ministry of Defense, Appendixes to Instruction No. 440”), as seen in Figure 4. Inside of the RAR
archive, there is an executable file named “Наказ_МОУ_Додатки_до_Iнструкцii_440_ост.exe” that
uses a RAR SFX icon. Victims would presumably run this file, thinking that further contents of a selfextracting archive would be extracted, but will inadvertently launch the malicious executable instead.
Method #3: Word document plus CVE-2017-0199 exploit. This vulnerability is triggered when the victim
opens a specially crafted Word document. The Word process issues an HTTP request for an HTA file that
contains a malicious script, located on a remote server. The malicious script will then be executed by
mshta.exe. The first public information about this vulnerability appeared in April 2017 and Microsoft fixed
it by issuing Security updates for all versions of Windows and Office.
According to ESET’s telemetry, these threat actors started using this method in May 2017. Attackers
used hxxp://chip-tuning.lg[.]ua/ to deliver the HTA files and the final payload.

information and copyright year reliably tell us that it’s a fake.

INSTALLATION AND PERSISTENCE
The installation procedure is the same for all three malware strains used by these attackers. A dropper
drops a malicious payload file (Vermin, Quasar or Sobaken malware) into the %APPDATA% folder, in a
subfolder named after a legitimate company (usually Adobe, Intel or Microsoft). Then, as seen
in Figure 5, it creates a scheduled task that runs the payload every 10 minutes to ensure its persistence.
Some versions also employ a trick of abusing the Windows Control Panel shortcut functionality to make
their folders inaccessible from Windows Explorer. Such a folder will not open when clicked in Windows
Explorer; instead it leads to the All Tasks page in the Windows Control Panel.

VICTIM TARGETING
The attackers have been using quite a few tricks to ensure that the malware runs on targeted machines
only, with special focus on avoiding automated analysis systems and sandboxes.
Method #1: Windows keyboard layout check.
The malware checks if Russian or Ukrainian keyboard layout is installed. If not, it terminates
immediately.
Method #2: IP address check.
The malware obtains its host computer’s IP address via a request to the legitimate service
ipinfo.io/json. The malware terminates if the IP address is not located in Ukraine or Russia, or if the IP
address is registered to one of several selected antimalware vendors or cloud providers. Code related to
these checks is seen in the disassemblies in Figures 6 and 7.

Figure 6 // Code checking geolocation of host IP address.

Figure 7 // Code checking IP address against a list of cloud providers and antimalware vendors.

Method #3: Emulated network environment check.
Automated analysis systems often use tools like Fakenet-NG where all DNS/HTTP communication
succeeds and returns some result. Malware authors try to identify such systems by generating a random
website name/URL and testing for connection to the URL to fail, such as in Figure 8, as would be
expected on a real system.

Method #4: Specific username check.
The malware refuses to run under accounts with usernames typical of automated malware analysis
systems, as seen in Figure 9.

USE OF STEGANOGRAPHY TO BYPASS CONTENT FILTERING
In mid-2017, the attackers explored the possibility of hiding payloads in images that were hosted on the
free image hosting websites saveshot.net and ibb.co.
Steganography is the science of hiding data “in plain sight” – within other, non-secret data. In this case,
a malicious EXE file was encrypted and hidden inside a valid JPEG file, such as the example in Figure 10.
The malware downloaded and decoded the JPEG file, extracted the hidden data, decrypted the EXE file
from that data, and launched it.

Figure 10 // Example of a JPEG image used for payload hiding (image resized and payload removed).

The decryption process is quite complex and can be described as follows:
1. Download the JPEG from the URL hardcoded in the downloader binary.
2. Brute-force an 8-digit password by calculating its hash and verifying against the hash hardcoded
in the downloader binary. This step is very CPU intensive and takes typical desktop computer 10+
minutes to complete. This is most likely another measure against automated malware analysis
systems.
3. Process the JPEG file and extract data hidden in it, as seen in the code disassemblies
in Figures 11 and 12. The algorithm used by the malware is very similar to JSteg, one of the oldest and
simplest steganography algorithms for JPEG files that hides data in the LSB (least significant bit)
of JPEG DCT coefficients. Such hidden data does not usually affect an image in a way that is visible
to the naked eye, but the presence of hidden data is easily detectable with specialized algorithms.
However, this steganography algorithm is very easy to implement, which is probably the reason it
was chosen by the malware authors.
4. Extract data and decompress using GZip.
5. Decrypt the decompressed data using AES and the password obtained in step 2.
6. Decode decrypted data using Base64.
7. Write EXE file to disk and execute it.
Eventually, these threat authors abandoned the steganography idea and started using
hxxp://chip-tuning.lg[.]ua to serve unencrypted malware executables.

MALWARE STRAINS
These threat actors are using three different malware strains in their attacks. We will provide a quick
overview of each of them and focus on describing their unique features.

Quasar
Quasar is an open-source RAT (Remote Access Tool) which is freely available on GitHub. We’ve seen
several campaigns where these threat actors used Quasar RAT binaries.
The first campaign we are aware of lasted from October 2015 to April 2016.
The next campaign utilizing the Quasar RAT took place in February 2017. Compilation artifacts show the
PDB path n:\projects\Viral\baybak_files_only\QRClient\QuasarRAT-master\Library\obj\
Release\Library.pdb
Another Quasar RAT campaign using these attackers’ C&C servers (mailukr.net) occurred in JulySeptember 2017. In this case, attackers used an old version of the Quasar RAT named “xRAT 2.0
RELEASE3”. Compilation artifacts in the dropper show the PDB path N:\shtorm\WinRARArchive\
obj\Release\WinRAR.pdb

Sobaken
Sobaken is a heavily modified version of the Quasar RAT. When comparing the program structure of
Quasar and Sobaken, we can see quite a few similarities, such as in Figure 13.
The malware authors keep removing functionality, thus creating a much smaller executable, which is
also easier to hide. They also added anti-sandbox, and other evasion, tricks described above.

Vermin
Vermin is a custom-made backdoor that is used only by these threat actors, and was first documented
in Palo Alto Networks report from January 2018. It first appeared in mid-2016 and is still in use. Just like
Quasar and Sobaken, it is written in .NET. To slow down analysis, the program code is protected using
the commercial .NET code protection system .NET Reactor or the open-source protector ConfuserEx.
Also, just like Sobaken, it uses Vitevic Assembly Embedder, free software for embedding required DLLs
into the main executable, available from Visual Studio Marketplace.

Functionality
Vermin is a full-featured backdoor with several optional components. The latest known version of
Vermin at the time of writing (Vermin 2.0) supports the following, self-explanatory, commands:
• StartCaptureScreen
• StopCaptureScreen
• ReadDirectory
• UploadFile
• DownloadFile
• CancelUploadFile
• CancelDownloadFile
• GetMonitors
• DeleteFiles
• ShellExec
• GetProcesses
• KillProcess
• CheckIfProcessIsRunning
• CheckIfTaskIsRunning
• RunKeyLogger
• CreateFolder
• RenameFolder
• DeleteFolder
• UpdateBot
• RenameFile
• ArchiveAndSplit
• StartAudioCapture
• StopAudioCapture
• SetMicVolume.
Most of the commands are implemented in the main payload, though several commands and additional
functionality are implemented via optional components that attackers upload to the victim’s machine.
Known optional components include:
• Audio recorder
• Keylogger
• Password stealer
• USB file stealer

Audio recorder (AudioManager)
This is a full-featured component of Vermin that can record audio from the microphone on the victim’s
computer. It implements three of Vermin’s commands: StartAudioCapture, StopAudioCapture and
SetMicVolume. Captured data is compressed using Speex codecs and uploaded in SOAP format to
Vermin’s C&C servers.

Keylogger (KeyboardHookLib)
Vermin’s keylogger is a simple standalone executable that sets global keyboard hooks and writes all
keystrokes into a file in an encrypted form. It also logs clipboard contents and active window titles. The
keylogger cannot connect to Vermin’s C&C servers by itself – the main backdoor component is used to
transfer collected information to the attackers’ servers.
The PDB path in the keylogger component confirms its association with the Vermin malware:
Z:\Projects\Vermin\KeyboardHookLib\obj\Release\AdobePrintLib.pdb

Password stealer (PwdFetcher)
Vermin’s standalone password stealer is used to extract saved passwords from browsers (Chrome,
Opera). The majority of its code appears to be copy-pasted from an article on the Russian forum
Habrahabr. Some samples also contain code for extracting information from the Firefox browser,
however, it appears to be unused. As seen in Figure 14, this component also contains PDB paths similar
to that seen in the keylogger component, confirming its association with the Vermin malware.

Figure 14 // Compilation artifacts linking the password stealer to the Vermin malware.

USB f ile stealer (UsbGuard)
UsbGuard.exe is an optional component used by both Sobaken and Vermin. It is a small, standalone
program that monitors USB drives connected to the computer and copies all files that match the filter
chosen by the attackers. The stolen files were later exfiltrated using the main backdoor module. Many
and various PDB paths clearly linking them to Vermin are found in samples of this component.
Since April 2018, the file stealer has been used as a standalone tool. It copies files and immediately
uploads them to a server controlled by the attackers.

In the analyzed samples, attackers were after files with the following extensions:
• .doc
• .docx
• .xls
• .xlsx
• .zip
• .rar
• .7z
• .docm
• .txt
• .rtf
• .xlsm
• .pdf
• .jpg
• .jpeg
• .tif
• .odt
• .ods

CONCLUSION
Among the many different malware attacks targeted at high value assets in Ukraine, these attackers
haven’t received much public attention – perhaps because of their initial use of open-source-based
malware before developing their own strain (Vermin).
Employing multiple malware families, as well as various infection mechanisms – including common
social engineering techniques but also not-so-common steganography – over the past three years,
could be explained by the attackers simply experimenting with various techniques and malware, or it
may suggest operations by multiple subgroups.
The fact that the attackers successfully used relatively trivial techniques, such as sending RAR and EXE
files by email (a bad practice, which still takes place among users) highlights the importance of securing
the human factor in computer network protection.
