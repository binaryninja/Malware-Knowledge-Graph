INTRODUCTION
In this M-Trends 2018 report, we look at some of the latest trends
identified during the October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 reporting
period, as revealed through incident response investigations by
Mandiant, a FireEye company.
When it comes to detecting compromises, organizations
appear to be getting better at discovering breaches
internally, as opposed to being notified by law enforcement
or some other outside source. This is important because
our data shows that incidents identified internally tend
to have a much shorter dwell time. However, the global
median dwell time from compromise to discovery is up
from 99 days in 2016 to 101 days in 2017.
In this year’s report, we explore some longer-term trends,
many of which have evolved. We look at organizations that
have been targeted or re-compromised after remediating
a previous attack, a topic we first discussed in M-Trends
2013. We also examine the widening cyber security skills
gap and the rising demand for skilled personnel capable
of meeting the challenges posed by today’s more
sophisticated threat actors.

We take a detailed look at a Mandiant Red Team Assessment
to explore how we leverage sophisticated attacker tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) in simulated attacks to
show organizations what they need to do to stay ahead of
those threats. We also provide examples of where we saw
attackers exploit weaknesses in an organization’s detection
and prevention controls.
M-Trends 2018 can arm security teams with the knowledge
they need to defend against today’s most often used cyber
attacks, as well as lesser seen and emerging threats.
The information in this report has been sanitized to protect
identities of victims and their data.

2017 BY THE
NUMBERS
The statistics reported in
M-Trends are based on Mandiant
investigations into targeted
attack activity conducted
between October 1, 2016 and
September 30, 2017.
GLOBAL MEDIAN DWELL TIME
2016

2017

99
Days

Dwell time is the
number of days from
first evidence of
compromise that an
attacker is present on
a victim network
before detection.
A median represents a
value at the midpoint
of a sorted data set.
Mandiant continues to
use the median value
over ‘mean’ or ‘average’
to minimize the impact
of outlying values.

101
Days

Global
The global median dwell time of 101 days is essentially unchanged
from last year’s report of 99 days. Organizations across the globe are
identifying attacker activity on their own more often than they are being
notified by an external source, with 62% of breaches detected internally.
Mandiant’s position in the market would tend to skew our statistics
toward organizations who were notified of an incident by a third party,
since presumably an organization is less likely to be confident they can
investigate an incident they failed to identify on their own. The fact
that more clients self-identify the incidents we investigate for them is
a potential indication that detection capabilities have improved for all
organizations and not just Mandiant clients.

The Americas median dwell time
decreased slightly from 99 days in

Europe, the Middle East and Africa
(EMEA)
The median dwell time for EMEA
in 2017 was 175 days, up from 106
days in 2016. We attribute this to
increased notification programs by
national law enforcement. These
have uncovered attacks dating back
a significant period of time, many of
which involved active attackers in
the target environment at the time
of notification.

Asia-Pacific (APAC)
The median dwell time for APAC
increased in 2017 to 498 days, from
172 days in 2016. This dwell time is
similar to the APAC dwell time of 520
days reported in M-Trends 2016. It
is also similar to the first dwell time
statistic ever reported by Mandiant,
which was a global dwell time of 417
days. With a maximum observed
dwell time of 2,085 days, attackers
in APAC are often able to maintain
access in compromised organizations
for far too long.

NEWLY NAMED
APT GROUPS
FireEye tracks thousands of threat actors, but pays
special attention to state-sponsored attackers who
carry out advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks.
Unlike many cyber criminals, APT attackers often
pursue their objectives over months or years. They
adapt to a victim organization’s attempts to remove
them from the network and frequently target the
same victim if their access is lost.

FireEye tracks more than a thousand uncategorized
attackers and only promotes a TEMP group to a named APT
group when we have confidence surrounding their specific:

Sponsoring nation

Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

Target profile

Attack motivations

In 2017, FireEye promoted four attackers from previously
tracked TEMP groups to APT groups.

APT32
March 20, 2017

Since at least 2014, APT32, also known as the OceanLotus
Group, has targeted foreign corporations with investments
in Vietnam, foreign governments, journalists, and
Vietnamese dissidents. Evidence also suggests that APT32
has targeted network security and technology infrastructure
corporations with connections to foreign investors.
During a recent campaign, APT32 leveraged social
engineering emails with Microsoft ActiveMime file
attachments to deliver malicious macros. Upon execution,
the initialized file typically downloaded malicious
payloads from a remote server.

FireEye asesses that APT32 actors may be aligned with the
national interests of Vietnam. We believe recent activity
targeting private interests in Vietnam suggests that APT32
poses a threat to companies doing business or preparing
to invest in the country. While the specific motivation for
this activity remains opaque, it could ultimately erode
targeted organizations’ competitive advantage.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

APT33
August 21, 2017

Since at least 2013, the Iranian threat group FireEye tracks as
APT33 has carried out a cyber espionage operation to collect
information from defense, aerospace and petrochemical
organizations. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest
APT33 targeted Saudi Arabian and Western organizations
that provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi
Arabia’s military and commercial fleets.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

APT33 leverages a mix of public and non-public tools
(Fig. 1) and often conducts spear-phishing operations
using a built-in phishing module from “ALFA TEaM Shell,”
a publicly available web shell. The use of multiple nonpublic backdoors suggests the group is supported by
software developers.
DROPSHOT is a notable piece of malware used to deliver
variants of the TURNEDUP backdoor. Although we
have only observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver
TURNEDUP, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT
samples in the wild that delivered wiper malware we
call SHAPESHIFT.1 The SHAPESHIFT wiper is capable of
wiping disks and volumes, as well as deleting files. Ties
to SHAPESHIFT suggest that APT33 may engage in
destructive operations or shares tools or development
resources with an Iranian threat group that conducts
destructive operations.

Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain Farsilanguage artifacts, which indicates that they may have
been developed by a Farsi language speaker. FireEye has
not identified APT33 using SHAPESHIFT, but APT33 is
the only group FireEye has seen to use DROPSHOT. The
overlap between SHAPESHIFT and DROPSHOT indicates
that tools ­­— specifically DROPSHOT ­­— or development
resources may be shared among Iranian threat groups,
or that APT33 may engage in destructive operations.
In a recent attack, APT33 sent spear-phishing emails to
workers in the aviation industry. These emails included
recruitment-themed lures and links to malicious HTML
application (HTA) files. The HTA files contained job
descriptions and links to job postings on popular
employment websites. The file would appear to be a
legitimate job posting, but the HTA file also contained
malicious content that downloaded a custom APT33
backdoor from an attacker-controlled domain.

APT34

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Since at least 2014, an Iranian threat group tracked by
FireEye as APT34 has conducted reconnaissance aligned
with the strategic interests of Iran. The group conducts
operations primarily in the Middle East, targeting financial,
government, energy, chemical, telecommunications and
other industries. Repeated targeting of Middle Eastern
financial, energy and government organizations leads
FireEye to assess that those sectors are a primary
concern of APT34. The use of infrastructure tied to
Iranian operations, timing and alignment with the national
interests of Iran also lead FireEye to assess that APT34
acts on behalf of the Iranian government.

15

APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools
(Fig. 2) and often uses compromised accounts to conduct
spear-phishing operations. In July 2017, FireEye observed
APT34 targeting an organization in the Middle East using
the POWRUNER PowerShell-based backdoor and the
downloader BONDUPDATER, which includes a domain
generation algorithm (DGA) for command and control.
POWRUNER was delivered using a malicious RTF file
that exploited CVE-2017-0199. In November 2017, APT34
leveraged the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-201711882 to deploy POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER less
than a week after Microsoft issued a patch.

APT35
December 15, 2017

FireEye has identified APT35 operations dating back
to 2014. APT35, also known as the Newscaster Team,
is a threat group sponsored by the Iranian government
that conducts long term, resource-intensive operations
to collect strategic intelligence. APT35 typically targets
U.S. and the Middle Eastern military, diplomatic and
government personnel, organizations in the media, energy
and defense industrial base (DIB), and engineering,
business services and telecommunications sectors.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

APT35 has historically used unsophisticated tools like
those listed below in Figure 3. Their complex social
engineering campaigns, however, employ fake social
media personas with convincing backgrounds that
include supporting details and links to real persons and
organizations. Many of the fake personas utilized by
APT35 claimed to be part of news organizations, which led
to APT35 being referred to as the Newscaster Team. The
effort required to establish these networks and online front
organizations suggests the group is well resourced.
More recent operations suggest that APT35 has expanded
both the scope of its targeting and its employed toolset.
From August 2016 to August 2017, APT35 engaged in
multiple operations against a broad range of victims,
including those in the following sectors:

Telecommunications

Business services

Energy

Construction and engineering

Government

Defense

Media

IRAN
STATE-SPONSORED
ESPIONAGE

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Throughout 2017, Mandiant observed a significant
increase in the number of cyber attacks originating
from threat actors sponsored by Iran. While they have
captured notoriety over the past year, especially for their
destructive attacks, much of their espionage activity has
gone unnoticed. Their list of victims currently spans nearly
every industry sector and extends well beyond regional
conflicts in the Middle East.
For some time, these threat actors were primarily a
nuisance consisting of a loose collective of patriotic
hackers who conducted web defacements, distributed
denial of service (DDoS) campaigns and occasional
destructive malware attacks. Since 2010, post-Stuxnet, Iran
has increased its cyber espionage capabilities and is now
operating at a pace and scale consistent with other nationstate sponsored APT groups.

19

Iranian threat actors have compromised a variety of
organizations, but recently they have expanded their
efforts in a way that previously seemed beyond their
grasp. Today they leverage strategic web compromises
(SWC) to ensnare more victims, and to concurrently
maintain persistence across multiple organizations for
months and sometimes years. Rather than relying on
publicly available malware and utilities, they develop and
deploy custom malware. When they are not carrying
out destructive attacks against their targets, they are
conducting espionage and stealing data like professionals.

20

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

APT35

CASE STUDY: APT35
In early 2017, Mandiant responded to an incident involving
APT35 targeting an energy company. The attacker
used a spear-phishing email containing a link to a fake
resume hosted on a legitimate website that had been
compromised. The resume contained the PUPYRAT
backdoor, which communicated with known APT35
infrastructure. APT35 also installed BROKEYOLK, a custom
backdoor, to maintain persistence on the compromised
host. They then proceeded to log directly into the VPN
using the credentials of the compromised user.

1. Copied a modified variant
of Mimikatz to the remote
system.

2. Executed Microsoft’s
Sysinternal’s PsExec utility
to deploy and execute
a Windows batch file
containing commands
to execute the Mimikatz
variant on each target
system.

Once connected to the VPN, APT35 focused on stealing
domain credentials from a Microsoft Active Directory
Domain Controller to allow them to authenticate to the
single-factor VPN and Office 365 instance. The attacker did
not deploy additional backdoors to the environment.
During the analysis of a compromised domain controller,
Mandiant identified batch files (Fig. 4) that were used to
steal credentials and hide attacker activity by performing
the following actions:

3. Copied the contents of
the Mimikatz output to a
local file, named after the
remote system.

4. Deleted the modified
variant of Mimikatz from
the remote system.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

While the credential harvesting technique
was unsophisticated, it was effective.
Mandiant’s analysis indicated the attacker
successfully harvested credentials from more
than 500 systems within the environment
using this technique.
While having access to the organization’s
environment, the attacker targeted data
related to entities in the Middle East.
Mandiant has previously observed targeted
attackers stealing email, but few threat actors
have been as successful at this as APT35.
Additionally, the attacker’s methodology for
accessing and stealing email from a victim
organization adapted to accommodate cloud
migration trends as companies moved to offpremises email solutions such as Office 365.
Forensic analysis revealed the attacker
leveraged Microsoft Exchange Client Access
cmdlets to modify permissions on target
mailboxes. Exchange has several Client
Access cmdlets that are used legitimately by
Exchange administrators for routine tasks
and maintenance.

Mandiant observed that the attacker had
granted compromised accounts read access
to hundreds of mailboxes with the “AddMailboxPermission” cmdlet (Fig. 5).
Following the assignment of mailbox
permissions, the attacker authenticated to
the victim organization’s Outlook Web Access
(OWA) portal to access targeted inboxes.
By assigning these permissions to a single
account, the attacker was able to read, access
and steal hundreds of emails in a single view.
The attacker could also blend into normal
day-to-day activities of users accessing their
email through the OWA portal, and did not
need to install any additional malware into the
environment. Ultimately, APT35 had used
access to hundreds of mailboxes to read email
communications and steal data related to
Middle East organizations, which later became
victims of destructive attacks.

A cmdlet is a
lightweight Windows
PowerShell command.

HIDDEN THREATS
REMAIN IN LEGACY
SYSTEMS
A case study from Asia Pacific
Organizations continue to struggle with tracking and
maintaining their internet footprint. This case study
from Asia Pacific illustrates the continuation of a
well-established trend of exposure and compromise
of poorly protected and overlooked legacy systems.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

A large company in Asia was recently the latest
in a long line of organizations to be compromised
because Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is
accessible from the Internet.
The breach was identified through the discovery of
an unauthorized database administrator account
on a billing database server. The company’s internal
investigation uncovered unauthorized RDP logons
by a local administrator account to a legacy
web server. The attacker then connected to and
tunneled connections through an intermediary
system in the client environment. From the
intermediary system, the attacker was able to
access a database server using a separate database
administrator account. The client quickly identified
and decommissioned the web server and other
legacy systems and changed the password of
accounts used by the attacker.
At some point during the compromise the client’s
antivirus software began detecting some of the
attacker’s password dumping tools, so the attacker
added the “C:\temp\” directory, which was being
used as a tool repository, to the list of directories to
not be scanned by antivirus software. Configuring the
antivirus software to ignore the directory “C:\temp”
created a registry artifact (Fig. 6) that helped identify
additional systems compromised by the attacker.

23

Initial compromise: Mandiant identified evidence of
malicious activity dating back several years, and that
the environment had been accessed by more than
one attacker. Mandiant was unable to identify how the
environment was first compromised due to evidence
decay.
Establish foothold: The attacker moved laterally within
the environment and installed a variety of backdoors,
keyloggers and network traffic tunnelers, ranging from
publicly available malware such as Gh0stRAT, Empire,
and the China Chopper web shell, to some highly
powerful and non-public malware.
Escalate privileges: The attacker leveraged credentials
obtained from domain controllers and keyloggers
installed on the systems of high-value individuals to
provide access to the environment.
Internal reconnaissance: The attacker conducted
internal reconnaissance using built-in tools and tools
that the attacker placed in the environment. Examples
of the methods used for internal reconnaissance
included:
• PowerShell
• Windows Task Scheduler
• NBTScan
• TCPScan
• Non-public keyloggers

This case illustrates the risk posed by having the
RDP accessible from the Internet. Access to RDP is a
common vector used by attackers to gain access to
environments either directly from the Internet or by
leveraging access they gain through a third-party.

• Non-public screen recorders
Complete mission: The attacker targeted billing and
customer information. Mandiant identified evidence
suggesting gigabytes of sensitive customer information
had been exfiltrated from the network.

ONCE A TARGET,
Always a Target
A significant attack is
attacker activity that
may include data theft,
compromised accounts,
credential harvesting,
lateral movement and
spear phishing, which
affects at least 43% of
our managed detection
and response customers.

In 2013 M-Trends, we looked at organizations that had been targeted or recompromised after remediating a previous attack. Our original data showed
38 percent of clients were attacked after remediation. Our 2017 data shows
that, 56 percent of FireEye managed detection and response customers who
were previously Mandiant incident response clients were targets of at least
one significant attack in the past 19 months by the same or similarly motivated
attack group.
We also found that:

49%

86%

of customers with at least
one significant attack were
successfully attacked again
within one year.

of the time, customers
who have had more than
one significant attack have
also had more than one
unique attacker in their
environment.

Regional Considerations
We find that customers in the APAC region are twice as likely to have experienced multiple incidents from multiple
attackers, compared to customers in EMEA or North America. Over 91 percent of our APAC customers with at least one
significant attack will have attacker activity within the next year (Fig. 7). Of those customers, 82 percent will have multiple
attackers identified over the life of their service (Fig. 8).

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

There is a difference between
industries that have been successfully
attacked by multiple threat groups
versus industries that are targeted
most often. Notably, the high-tech
industry is both frequently targeted
by multiple attackers and also sees
a large number of significant attack
attempts (Fig. 11).
This trend highlights the industries
that most often have to deal with
multiple types of threat actors, each
with potentially different missions and
TTPs to defend against.
• Several industries appear more

adaptive and more rigorous in
their security posture over time.
As an example, when we examine
the industries that suffer multiple
successful attacks, separated by
remediation attempts, we observed
that the financial industry was
ninth out of 16 industries. Our
experiences suggest the financial
services are less likely to succumb
to subsequent attacks over time.

RED TEAMING
for Security Effectiveness
Mandiant recently conducted a Red Team Assessment for an
organization hosting large amounts of personally identifiable
information (PII). The goal of the assessment was to validate the
organization’s ability to protect their PII. The red team was provided
with the organization’s name and no additional architectural
information, making it a black-box assessment.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

The red team used open source intelligence (OSINT) to
identify the external IP addresses, email addresses and
phone numbers that constituted the attack surface of the
organization. After creating a list of target email addresses,
the red team launched a phishing campaign using emails
with a hyperlink crafted to direct the user to an HTML
Application (HTA) payload. The payload launched the
Windows-native Certutil command, calling back to a
command and control (CnC) server. Three systems were
compromised in the initial phishing campaign of 30 users.
One hour after the phishing campaign started, one of
the targeted users reported the phishing email to the
organization’s abuse mailbox. The security operations
center (SOC) responded to the report and blacklisted the
fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the web server
hosting the HTA payload, but infected workstations
continued to connect to the red team’s CnC server. The
FQDN of the CnC server was not identified and blocked by

27

the SOC because the HTA payload was designed to bypass
manual and automated analysis by using a combination of
obfuscation and sandbox evasion techniques.
HTA payloads allow the red team to create convincing
scenarios while delivering a flexible payload through the
power of Microsoft’s VBScript and JScript languages.
HTAs also enable red teams to bypass application allow
list controls because the native Windows application
associated with the “HTA” file extension, mshta.exe, is a
Microsoft-signed executable, a file type typically added to
application allow lists.
An unobfuscated HTA payload might run a command line
command by invoking the “Run” method of VBScript’s
WScript.Shell class (Fig. 12).

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

The unobfuscated HTA payload contains many plaintext
strings that automated analysis could leverage to
identify the HTA file as suspicious. For example, incident
responders often monitor for the use of the PowerShell
command, the syntax used to run a PowerShell command,
and the presence of what appears to be a base64 encoded
command. Creating an obfuscated payload is the simplest
way to avoid these common detections. Publicly available
tools, such as NCC Group’s Demiguise2 can automatically
create obfuscated HTA payloads that can only be decoded
by the key provided during the obfuscation process.

Figure 13 demonstrates the Demiguise obfuscation process
used to generate an HTML document that relies on a
specific string (in this case, 1.2.3.4) as the key to decrypt the
HTA payload. In this case, the key is the external IP address
of the victim organization. This can be obtained from OSINT
or a previous compromise. The victim must have the same
external IP address to decrypt the payload, effectively
bypassing sandboxes hosted in a cloud environment.

To avoid sandbox detection mechanisms often deployed in mature environments, sandbox evasion techniques can be
built into the payload with the obfuscation. A red team could use any number of sandbox evasion techniques including
forcing the malware to wait or “sleep” a specified period of time before executing (Fig. 15), checking for mouse movement
or clicks, or checking that a minimum number of processes are present for the payload to be executed. Combined with
Demiguise, the final payload file has little to detect (Fig. 16).

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

The SOC was unable to identify the CnC server using
network traffic analysis due to the use of a covert CnC
communication known as domain fronting. This attack
technique has been leveraged by Russian nation-state
actors such as APT29. Originally developed as a technique
to avoid censorship-based blocking of Internet traffic,
domain fronting allows an attacker to abuse HTTPS
connections to hide CnC activity in network traffic so
that it is indistinguishable from legitimate requests for
popular websites. The true destination of the CnC activity
is obscured through the content delivery networks (CDNs).
This technique leverages the HTTP “Host” header used in
many shared hosting environments to specify the target
for a specified request. This allowed Mandiant’s red team
to hide its CnC traffic in what appeared to be legitimate
requests for sites hosted in the CDN. The red team used a
configuration (Fig. 17) derived by following these steps:

3. Set the “Host” header on subsequent HTTPS CnC
requests to point to the CDN instance. This will cause
the CDN to direct all requests to the actual domain
rather than the impersonated domain used for the initial
SSL/TLS connection.
Domain fronting gives an attacker several advantages:
• Renders detection of CnC traffic using known IP

addresses or domain names ineffective.
• Makes anomaly detection ineffective because the traffic

is indistinguishable from other traffic destined for large
CDNs.
• Makes detection based on known bad or anomalous

SSL/TLS certificates ineffective because the domain
name and SSL/TLS certificate belong to a legitimate site
in the CDN.

1. Create a CDN instance in the same shared hosting
environment and configure this instance to forward
traffic to the red team’s malicious CnC server.

• Creates challenges to remediation since blocking CnC

2. During CnC communications, establish an SSL/TLS
connection to a well-known site that uses the same CDN.
There are publicly available lists of domains that can be
used as an impersonated domain for most major CDNs.

The red team persisted on the initial three compromised systems using a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
event subscriber. The event subscription consisted of an event filter that acted as a trigger and an event consumer that
executed the payload, in this case Symantec’s signed “symerr.exe”. The “symerr.exe” executable loads a DLL named “cclib.dll”
from its current working directory, so Mandiant leveraged this functionality to load a malicious DLL (Fig. 18 and 19).

Figure 18. Persistence using symerr.exe.

C:\Program Files\Norton Internet Security\Engine\22.9.0.68\symerr.exe cclib.dll

Figure 19. Properties of symerr.exe.

Once a persistence mechanism was deployed to a
few systems, the red team moved quickly to escalate
privileges and move laterally before the initial systems
and communications to the compromised network were
lost. The red team looked for opportunities to escalate
privileges in the domain using various techniques.
One avenue that proved useful in this assessment was
a misconfigured “userPassword” attribute in Active
Directory.
Depending on the Active Directory configuration, this
attribute can be treated as either of the following:
• An ordinary Unicode attribute, which can be written and

read as any other Unicode attribute in directory.
• A shortcut to userPassword in directory, which will allow

password change operation to be performed over LDAP.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

PowerView3 has a “Get-NetUser” function that assists with automating the process of looking up this attribute in Active
Directory. The red team used the command (Fig. 20) to harvest credentials for several service accounts on the Active
Directory domain. Plaintext passwords are stored in the “userPassword” attribute in Unicode format (Fig. 21).

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

With domain credentials, the red team was able to move
laterally to additional systems in the environment. At this
stage, the red team encountered a significant number of
servers using Device Guard with constrained language
mode enabled and an application allow list. There are
several ways to bypass Device Guard and an application
allow list, one of which is the built-in Microsoft signed
executable “MSBuild.exe”. Using signed executables
allowed Mandiant to bypass the application allow list by
executing payloads in the context of a Microsoft signed
process. Using the open source script PowerLessShell,4
Mandiant’s red team executed PowerShell scripts and
payloads without launching “PowerShell.exe” directly. With
this tool, Mandiant generated a “csproj” file containing the
payload and copied it to a new system. Mandiant could
then use WMI commands to remotely execute MSBuild,
which, in turn, executed the malicious “csproj” payload.
Mandiant used credentials from the “userPassword” field to
access systems containing domain administrator sessions
and used Mimikatz to read LSASS memory and obtain
clear text credentials for a domain administrator account.

A jump server is a special-purpose
computer that is hardened against attack
and provides remote access to systems in
a different network security zone.

Completing the Mission
At this this point the red team had domain administrator
privileges, but the target database server storing PII
was protected by jump servers that required two-factor
authentication (2FA).
The easiest way to bypass 2FA is not to attack the
solution itself, but to leverage its capabilities and a lack
of adherence to security best practices to obtain the
second factor for some number of users. Soft tokens are
easily distributed to users, but they create additional risk
when stored on local computers and network shares.
Unfortunately, this is often the case with users and IT
administrators. Soft tokens are often not secured with a
password, or a default password is stored with the soft
token that allows an attacker to import the soft token.
Once an attacker has imported a soft token, the process
of identifying the workstation belonging to the user and
keylogging the user to obtain their PIN is straightforward.
During the assessment, Mandiant’s red team identified
955 soft token files as having the “stdtid” extension, which
is the default for RSA soft token files. With RSA soft
tokens, “otf” files containing email templates with a default
“import password” were also found (Fig. 22). The red team
used “stoken”5 to brute force all the soft token files to
see which soft tokens could be imported with the default
password. In this case, the default password worked for
more than 500 soft tokens, including jump server and
database administrators.

With user credentials and a token code, the red team was only
missing the corresponding PIN. The red team obtained the RSA PIN
codes for the jump server by installing a keystroke logger on the
workstations of administrators and database administrators, as is
shown in Fig. 23.

After obtaining all of the components to authenticate to the
jump server, the red team authenticated to the jump server,
which contained a route to all database servers hosted in
the network segment hosting PII. Once on the jump server,
the red team identified 210 hosts in the SSH “known_hosts”
file. This provided SSH routes to 210 database servers.6

A script (Fig. 24) was used to connect severs and identify
databases having names that would indicate they may
contain PII. More than a million PII records were identified in
the databases.

Becoming Better Attackers for Better Preparedness
Mandiant’s red team is constantly learning from attackers not only to perform
successful assessments without detection, but also to help our detection teams
keep pace with the attackers. When new techniques are released, our red team will
immediately take that technique, try to weaponize it or make it better, and work
with our detection team to help them improve detection for that technique.

CYBER SECURITY
SKILLS GAP
The Invisible Risk

In the ongoing battle to secure organizations from
malicious actors that commit crimes through methods
such as theft, destruction or data manipulation, frontline
defenders are a scarce resource. As the demand for skilled
personnel capable of meeting the challenges posed by
these threat actors continues to rise, the supply simply
cannot keep pace.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

A growing deficit in information security personnel
is expected to dramatically exacerbate the current
considerable skills gap over the next five years. This
assertion is supported by industry research data from
the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)
and insights gained from Mandiant engagements
throughout 2017. In 2017, NICE reported that 285,000
cyber security roles went unfilled in the U.S. alone.
While the scarcity of experienced professionals can be
felt across the entire information security spectrum,
trend analysis performed over the findings of cyber
defense center (CDC) engagements throughout the year
indicates that this shortage appears highly prevalent in
organizations looking to develop or mature their incident
response capabilities. The specialized skillset required
to respond, investigate and remediate cyber threats has
become highly valued and the industry is struggling to
keep pace with demand.
The Widening Gap
In many ways, the skills gap is tied to the quantitative
nature of these roles. While a CDC breaks free from
the traditional, linear SOC response process by unifying
multiple security and intelligence disciplines into a single
strategic incident response center for the organization,
personnel requirements at the most basic level are

39

comparable. Though the numbers tend to fluctuate based
on different industries, organization size and other factors,
the minimum number of personnel for an around-theclock CDC is approximately 9 to 12 full-time employees. A
traditional CDC structure breaks this baseline headcount
into incident response expertise levels, with a larger, less
experienced subset of the staff focused on initial detection
and triage and more seasoned personnel performing
investigation and remediation.
As a CDC matures, its need for a larger talent pool
grows. To maximize the cost of effectively handling
incident response internally, the CDC should be vigilant
in increasing the scope of its detection and response
capabilities throughout the organization to achieve its
strategic objectives. The effort to mature and develop
a more proactive security posture inevitably leads to
increased personnel requirements. The increased focus
on identifying and remediating risks before they cause
harm often necessitates investment in specialized skillsets,
including malware analysis, threat hunting, analytics,
automation and threat intelligence. The more effective
a SOC becomes, the greater its scope becomes and the
more responsibility it will inevitability take on.

40

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Limitations in Visibility and Detection
The ability to detect events within the organization that
could be indicative of a greater incident is central to an
effective incident response capability. The single most
pervasive trend in the investigations and assessments
that Mandiant conducted over the prior year was a gap
in visibility and detection. During the initial compromise
phase, key indicators of malicious activity are often
overlooked or mischaracterized as benign due to an
implicit trust that malicious activity will be flagged by
detection mechanisms. However, detection systems
often miss indicators of malicious activity due to poor
configuration by inadequately trained staff.

Another common trend is the lack of appropriate event
investigation because the security analysts lack the
experience to identify a legitimate threat from a constant
stream of potential indicators. Mandiant reviewed the
incidents they responded to in 2017, to see which phases
of the attack lifecycle provided the most evidence to
investigate (Fig. 25).

The data (Fig. 25) shows a definite gap in detections
during the initial compromise phase of the attack lifecycle,
which is one of the most critical moments when an
organization should be able to detect and prevent threats.
This is often due to a combination of an overabundance
of alerts that can overwhelm personnel and distract them
from efforts to identify and respond to real threats, and a
lack of in-house skills to quickly identify the events that are
noteworthy to investigate.
While some phases of the attack lifecycle, such as internal
reconnaisance and privilege escalation, have prevalent
indicators that can be easily identified or even automated,
once an attacker has breached the walls, detection of their
activities becomes substantially more difficult due to ever
evolving methods attackers have at their disposal. Events
at these phases require a greater level of experience and
skill to identify and investigate.
Many organizations believe the personnel skillset gaps
can be mitigated or offset by using tools to automate
“heavy lifting” of some tasks. However, automation can
provide a false sense of security if the organization relies
entirely on these tools without providing the human
element to ensure they are effectively configured and to
catch any outliers the tools may not address. As attacks
become more sophisticated, there is increasing value in
having proactive threat hunting measures and skills in
place to address potential risks before they impact the
organization.
Visibility and detection are multi-tiered capabilities that
rely on a chain of multiple roles. If even one link is left to
a member of the SOC who does not possess the skillset
required to be effective in the role, the entire chain is
compromised.

41

Lack of Incident Response Expertise
Another trend directly attributed to the widening skills gap
is a lack of expertise and experience in malware analysis,
threat intelligence and forensics investigations, as well
as handling major incidents. This is particularly common
in organizations with a young, burgeoning SOC. When
incidents arise within an organization, there are times when
the investigation challenge will be outside of the scope of
experience of the personnel responsible for mitigating the
risk. As niche specializations, these skills represent some of
the rarest and most sought after on the market.
This is a primary reason many organizations outsource
functions to firms that specialize in providing these roles,
whether through a managed solution for long-term
assistance or retainers with incident response firms to
assist as the need arises.
Addressing the Skills Gap
While the shortage of skilled cyber security professionals
is not diminishing, organizations can still mitigate their risk
of being attacked by investing in enhancing their existing
capabilities and outsourcing specialized roles.
Enhancement efforts can include process refinement to
maximize the efficiency of internal procedures, training
for existing personnel to increase and expand their skills,
proactive testing of critical incident response processes
through tabletop exercises, automation of overhead
processes such as ticket creation that typically require
time and effort that could be spent on investigations
and identifying new measures to address any gaps in the
organization’s current capabilities.

ENDURING TRENDS
in Security Fundamentals
Mandiant’s strategic security
services measure the maturity of
an organization’s cyber security
program across critical security
domains. The critical security
domains used to gain unauthorized
access to organizations are observed
annually by Mandiant during our
incident response investigations.

Common attacker TTPs were observed during incident response investigations
and further correlated by FireEye Threat Intelligence to correspond to areas
of weakness frequently seen by our strategic services. Six information security
domains were observed repeatedly:

Security risk
management

Incident
response

Identity and access
management

Network, cloud and data
center protection

Data
protection

Host and endpoint
protection

We also observed that while organizations are increasingly recognizing the
importance of operationalizing cyber threat intelligence (CTI), there are
weaknesses in implementation.
The following examples are based on engagements delivered in 2017, where
we saw attackers exploit weaknesses in an organization’s detection and
prevention controls.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

43

Security Risk Management

Identity and Access Management

We have observed that many organizations do not have
formalized threat and vulnerability management functions
with the authority and necessary visibility into all network
enclaves, assets and applications, and patches and
configuration changes are not applied in a consistent and
timely manner across the enterprise. Patch management
and configuration infrastructure often only covers a portion
of the assets the organizations’ environments, leaving
groups of assets to be independently managed, resulting in
inconsistencies in patching and configuration hardening.

We continue to observe that authentication and
authorization controls are often not hardened against
abuse from attackers. Two of the most common issues are
a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement
and securing privileged credentials. Many organizations
do not have MFA implemented, or they have a true MFA
solution that provides the second factor “out-of-band” and
not generated within the user’s device. Instead, they rely on
device certificate-based authentication, which is easier to
bypass. Additionally, organizations have not hardened their
Active Directory environments, such as by reducing the
exposure of Windows credentials in memory, and they have
not adequately secured privileged credentials from misuse.

Through our incident response and cyber threat intelligence
experience, we see attackers leveraging unpatched
vulnerabilities. These observations reinforce our belief in
the importance of having mature threat and vulnerability
management practices. In one case, an unnamed threat
actor exploited an unpatched Apache Struts framework
vulnerability of an organization’s externally facing
application server. The attacker then installed distributed
denial of service (DDoS) malware on the server to create a
platform to target other organizations.
Another example we observed APT35 (The Newscaster
Team) compromising at least three U.S.-based companies,
and performing reconnaissance at two other U.S.
organizations and one non-U.S. company. At least one
organization was likely compromised due to the attacker
exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in the Ektron CMS
platform, which allowed them to upload web shell
backdoors. The attacker then leveraged publicly available
malware and legitimate Windows tools to dump passwords
and exfiltrate data.

An example of an attacker exploiting single-factor
authentication is APT28 (Tsar Team) in their targeting of
hotel Wi-Fi networks. The group has used noteworthy
techniques, including sniffing passwords from the guest
Wi-Fi network traffic, poisoning the NetBIOS Name Service,
and spreading laterally using the ETERNALBLUE exploit. One
incident involved a user being compromised after connecting
to a public Wi-Fi network. Twelve hours after the victim
initially connected to the publicly available Wi-Fi network,
APT28 logged into the machine with stolen credentials. After
successfully accessing the machine, the attacker deployed
tools on the machine, spread laterally through the victim’s
network, and accessed the victim’s OWA account.
Another example of an attacker leveraging weakness
in authentication and authorization controls is APT10
(Menupass Team), which typically uses credential
harvesters to acquire privileged credentials. We observed
them executing tools such as Mimikatz and SysInternals
ProcDump to harvest user credentials in multiple intrusions
where FireEye responded. These were invoked using
different methods, including local execution, DLL searchorder hijacking, remote execution and output through
PsExec/WMIExec, and automated collection through
custom batch scripts.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Data Protection

Incident Response

Many organizations we work with do not have well-defined
data classification policies and protection requirements
for sensitive data types. Compounding this, these same
organizations often do not know all of the types of data
they possess and where they are located within the
enterprise in structured and unstructured locations. This
information is necessary to properly establish appropriate
detection and protection technologies and processes in
accordance with the data sensitivity level. The upcoming
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements
emphasize the importance of appropriate data handling
practices and protections more than ever, and provide the
mechanism to penalize organizations that are not taking
the proper actions to protect sensitive data.

We continue to see organizations struggle with
consolidated visibility across all enclaves of their
environments. Many organizations focus their monitoring
on regulated portions of their networks (e.g., PCI, SOX)
and have not expanded logging and monitoring efforts
to other less-scrutinized portions. Incomplete and
decentralized logging of investigation-relevant sources
hinder the detection and response capabilities of the
organization’s information security team.

In multiple cases, Mandiant observed attackers leveraging
minimal controls of sensitive data within the victim’s
environment. Sensitive intellectual property and PII were
not secured with additional controls such as network
segmentation, MFA, encryption and restrictive Internet
egress controls. In these cases, the organizations applied
few minimum internal controls beyond basic single-factor
user authentication to applications, code repositories and
network shares. Once the attackers were on the internal
network with the proper credentials, they completed their
mission of accessing the targeted information, staging the
data and exfiltrating gigabytes of sensitive information.

In many Mandiant incident response engagements, we
observed that attacker activity went unmitigated by the
organization’s information security monitoring team and
capability. This is due to many factors including lack of
authority, lack of visibility and a lack of instrumentation.
Mandiant often observes that information security is not
a dedicated function and does not have authority across
the organization, but only over a portion of assets. Specific
key instrumentation components we see missing include a
centralized log aggregation capability, host and endpoint
logging configurations (e.g., PowerShell, Sysmon, OS and
Application Audit logs) and network level visibility for
lateral movement.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Network, Cloud, and Data Center Protection
We commonly find deficiencies in network segmentation
and secure configuration of cloud services. When
customers do not have network segmentation properly
implemented, detection and remediation are much
more difficult, and the resulting impact of the breach is
significantly higher. Neglecting to secure cloud services,
such as the Office 365 email platform, results in attackers
gaining access to sensitive emails and data and a limited
ability for organizations to detect and investigate a breach.
Mandiant observed multiple cases of attackers targeting
an organization’s Office 365 instances to gain access to
sensitive messages. Examples of techniques observed
include malicious mailbox forwarding rules and abuse of
the Office 365 eDiscovery functionality. We have seen
attackers create the malicious mailbox forwarding rules
by doing the following:

1

Compromised several accounts through password
spraying the organization’s external Active
Directory Federation Services (AD FS) proxy.

2

Authenticated to the compromised accounts
and created a mailbox forwarding rule to forward
all messages to a malicious mail address under
their control. In other instances, attackers stole
Exchange service credentials during on-premises
network intrusions, then accessed the eDiscovery
functionality of Office 365 and ran searches
through the platform using keywords of interest
to the attackers.

3

Downloaded the resulting messages from the
queries.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Host and Endpoint
Protection

Common areas of weakness in endpoint protection that we
observed in organizations are advanced malware protections,
investigation capabilities and application allow lists. Many
organizations rely on legacy signature-based protections on the
endpoint. Coupled with that is the inability of information security
professionals to conduct deep forensic analyses of malicious
activity across the server and end user computing environments.
Application allow lists are another important detection and
prevention control we see lacking in the organizations we assess.
Without application allow lists, end users and attackers have the
ability to install arbitrary software in an uncontrolled manner. These
weaknesses are commonly exploited by attackers in the initial
compromise and establish foothold stages of the attacker lifecycle
in the incidents we investigate.
Phishing continues to be a primary preferred method of
compromising organizations because of its simplicity and
effectiveness. However, determined attackers will pivot to other
methods of deploying malware. As an example, in May 2017, FireEye
Threat Intelligence observed an uptick in activity related to an
ongoing campaign distributing Emotet malware. A wide variety of
lures and distribution methods were leveraged in this high-volume
campaign, including malicious Word document attachments, links
to Word documents, and links to JavaScript files to propagate
Emotet malware. The actor(s) behind this campaign leveraged
more than 300 compromised websites to host malicious Word
documents and Emotet payloads.
Advanced malware protections at the email and endpoint levels
provide a level of mitigation to these types of attacks; however,
attacker tactics are continuously changing. Logs and detections
from these controls should be regularly monitored and investigated
for signs of further intrusion into the target organizations
environment. Endpoint hardening such as application allow lists
and mitigations provided by the OS vendor should be applied
across the organization.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Improvements
Throughout 2017, Mandiant also observed improvements
in several other areas. These include increased executive
support and awareness of cyber security with GDPR
driving improved data protection practices, as well as
the need for incident response retainer agreements and
regular tabletop exercises.
We observed increased awareness of the need for cyber
security among business leaders, senior executives and
board members. As cyber attacks become more frequent
and sophisticated, organizations of all sizes across every
industry must make cyber risk management a priority.
Organizations that fall under the GDPR regulation
requirements are placing greater importance on improving
their handling of data protection initiatives. As a result of
these initiatives for compliance, PII is beginning to receive
more attention and protections in the form of segregation,
tokenization/masking, encryption and more aggressive
data purging policies. However, many organizations are still
in the beginning stages of preparing for the regulation.
More organizations are recognizing the need for incident
response retainer agreements to increase their ability to
quickly investigate cyber incidents and intrusions. This is

47

a result of a combination of an increasing number of cyber
insurance providers offering lower premiums to organizations
that show a proactive approach to cyber security, and
increased awareness that having an agreement in place can
greatly reduce the time to respond by outside investigators.
Mandiant observed that organizations are increasingly
using tabletop exercises for technical information security
and executive leadership teams to evaluate the tools,
processes and expertise their organizations use to respond
to cyber attacks.
Reducing Risk
Organizations need to continuously increase the maturity
of their information security program and reduce their
risk of compromise through an approach incorporating
likely real-world threats and attacker TTPs. Information
security leadership should be regularly communicating
this message to executives using a risk-based lens. As
cyber attacks become more frequent and sophisticated,
executives, business line leaders and boards of directors
need to take an active role in cyber risk management and
data breach preparedness. By doing this, investments and
mitigations can be placed in the areas of highest risk to
the organization.

PREDICTIONS
FOR 2018

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

Evolving Chinese Cyber Espionage
FireEye assesses with high confidence the Chinese
government has generally complied with the terms of
the September 2015 “Obama-Xi Agreement”. Under this
agreement, China agreed not to use state-sponsored
hackers to steal the intellectual property of U.S.
companies. FireEye’s research indicates Chinese cyber
operations targeting the intellectual property of U.S.
companies declined significantly around the signing of the
Obama-Xi Agreement. In 2013 FireEye identified a peak
of 72 concurrent operations were carried out by Chinese
state-sponsored attackers. In the months leading up to
the signing of the Obama-Xi Agreement fewer than 30
operations were observed, and at the time of publication,
FireEye is tracking six or fewer. The Trump Administration
renewed the deal, which serves as evidence that China is
generally viewed as complying with the agreement.
While FireEye assesses that the “Obama-Xi Agreement”
has led to a significant decrease in Chinese governmentcontrolled cyber operations specifically stealing
intellectual property, this does not mean China has ceased
cyberoperations against U.S. companies. In fact, FireEye
has seen an increase in the number of attacks against
U.S. companies that have resulted in the theft of business
information such as bid prices, contracts, and information
related to mergers and acquisitions. FireEye has also
seen a surge in cyber espionage campaigns targeting
business-to-business services such as cloud providers,
telecommunications companies and law firms. Attacking
service providers could allow Beijing to collect intelligence
on a broad group of targets in a manner that is less likely
to be detected.

APT10

49

We further assess China may be willing to violate the
“Obama-Xi Agreement” on strategic imperatives when
diplomatic consequences can be minimized. FireEye has
observed groups potentially preparing operations against
revolutionary technologies, such as artificial intelligence
and advanced batteries. China may be willing to risk
upsetting the status quo to obtain the economic and
military advances these technologies could provide.
Targeting the Software Supply Chain
Malware authors have increasingly leveraged the trust
between users and software providers. Users do not
expect malicious code to be introduced by updates from
trusted software vendors. In supply chain attacks, cyber
threat groups target the build servers, update servers and
other parts of the development or release environment.
The hackers then inject malware into software releases,
infecting users through official software distribution
channels. This attack method allows attackers to target
broad set of potential victims while obfuscating their
intended target(s).
In 2017, FireEye observed at least five cases where
advanced threat actors compromised software companies
to target users of the software. FireEye assesses that
advanced attackers will likely continue to leverage the
software supply chain to conduct cyber espionage.

Chinese threat group APT10 targets
IT service providers worldwide,
including accessing victim networks
through U.S.-based managed security
service providers (MSSP). APT10 spear
phishing emails have been relatively
unsophisticated, leveraging link (“.lnk”)
files within archives, files with two
extensions, and in some cases, simply
identically named decoy documents
and malicious launchers within the
same archive.

Chinese cyber espionage operators modified
the software packages of a legitimate vendor,
NetSarang Computer, allowing access to a
broad range of industries and institutions
that include financial services, transportation,
telecommunications, energy, media, academic,
retail, and gaming. Likewise, in June 2017,
suspected Russian actors deployed NotPetya
ransomware to various European targets by
compromising Ukrainian software vendor
M.E.Doc.

CONCLUSION
Some of the newest trends we observed in 2017 include
increased activity and sophistication from Iran, and an
increase in the retargeting of previously compromised
organizations. However, these are simply evolutions
of cyber security constants: threat actors from various
nations with diverse motivations will continue to attack,
and defenders will be tasked with stopping those
threats and doing everything they can – and that is
required – to protect their customers.

SPECIAL REPORT | M-TRENDS 2018

One of the highlights from our data is the global median
time for internal detection dropping by over three weeks,
from 80 days in 2016 to 57.5 days in 2017. Although the
global median time from compromise to discovery has
risen by two days, we see that organizations are getting
better at discovering compromises in-house with their own
internal teams.
Of course, there is still work to be done. The cyber security
skills gap that has existed for some time now appears to
be widening, bringing with it a rising demand for skilled
personnel capable of meeting the challenges posed by
today’s highly skilled threat actors. For organizations
looking to improve their own security teams, Red Team
Assessments can help. Mandiant’s red team engagements
involve leveraging sophisticated attacker TTPs to breach
organizations as a learning experience. As a result,
defenders can gain valuable insight into what they should
be doing to stay ahead of today’s most prominent threats.

51

While it’s important to focus on new and evolving threats,
we also urge security professionals to never neglect best
practices such as network segmentation, data segregation
and protecting their most sensitive information. It is also
just as important to be ready and able to respond to an
incident, since we all know it is a matter of “when,” not “if”
organizations will experience an attack. We encourage
organizations to hold incident response tabletop exercises
to simulate typical intrusion scenarios. These exercises
help expose participants – notably executives, legal
personnel and other staff – to incident response processes
and concepts. Additionally, organizations may want to
consider partnering with professionals that specialize in
defending against threats specific to the business.
Defenders have to get it right every single time, while
threat actors only need to get it right once. By sharing
information and solutions through M-Trends 2018 with
the security community, we continue to contribute to
the improvement of our collective security awareness,
knowledge and capabilities.
