Operation Parliament, who
is doing what?
By GReAT on April 12, 2018. 7 :00 am

Summary
Kaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early 2017 . T he
attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations. T he objective of
the attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial
bodies around the world.
1. T he attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017 , with the
main focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine. High-profile
organizations have also been targeted in other regions. T he number of attacks has decreased
since the beginning of 2018.
2. T he attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted political
figures in the MENA region. At first the attacks looked to be the work of the low-sophistication
Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a very different picture.
3. T argets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and officials,
political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research
centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other
unknown entities.
4. T he malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling
them to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HT T P requests.
5. Kaspersky Lab users and T hreat Management and Defense clients are protected from the attacks.

Cisco T alos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East region which
we believe may be connected.

Victimology and Statistics
Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically
motivated threat actor. T he campaign started in 2017 , with the attackers doing just enough to
achieve their goals. T hey most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have
access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide,
especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. T he victim systems range from personal desktop or
laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. T he nature of the targeted
ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance
and so on.
Victims have been spotted in the Palestinian T erritories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK,
Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark.

T he number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the attacks
– only a portion.

Attack description and attribution
Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East
region. T he attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in
the region. T hey have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the
infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. T he targeting seems to have slowed
down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was

obtained. T he targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by
Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that
was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).
With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and
complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.

Malware description
T he malware was first seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show any
similarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted and
obfuscated. Functionality was identified that enables HT T P communication with the C&C server and
invokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.
T he configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to the C&C
server is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local and network
encryption.
T he malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about the
infected machine. T he C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized configuration.
T he malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling them
to execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HT T P requests.

What should high-proﬁle organizations
do?
High-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them are
inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. T hese organizations need to pay particular attention to their
security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well protected. Anti-targeted attack
solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows, default-deny application lockdown, endpoint
detection and response, data leak and insider threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped
networks should form the basis of any strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat
landscape.

T he victims of Operation Parliament need to re-evaluate their approach to cybersecurity.
