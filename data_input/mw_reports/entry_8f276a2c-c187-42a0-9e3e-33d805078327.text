Earth Karkaddan APT: Adversary
Intelligence and Monitoring (AIM)
Report
Technical Brief

Executive Summary
Brief Definition
APT36, or Earth Karkaddan, is a politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group primarily
focused on compromising Indian military and diplomatic resources. Earth Karkaddan is known for using
social engineering and email as an entry point, which then leads to the deployment of the Crimson remote
access trojan (RAT) malware.
Aside from using the Crimson RAT malware, Earth Karkaddan also recently expanded its Windows malware
arsenal to include other RATs such as ObliqueRati and NetWire malware. In the past, the APT group has
occasionally used custom Android application package (APK) backdoors.

Malware Analysis

Figure 1. Various infection chains of Earth Karkaddan campaigns
Earth Karkaddan Infection Chain
The following infection chains are typical of Earth Karkaddan campaigns, but these may vary slightly over
time.
Chain
1

Description
The most common arrival method for Earth Karkaddan is via a spear phishing
email that contains an attached document.
The document contains a malicious macro, which, when enabled, will drop
and execute a RAT malware, most commonly Crimson RAT.
The RAT malware will then communicate with its command-and-control (C&C)
server and can either download more malware or perform backdoor
commands such as exfiltrating data.

2

The Crimson RAT malware can also arrive via a USB worm.

3

Earth Karkaddan can also infect victims using a custom-made Android RAT
that can arrive via a phishing link.

From a global view of Earth Karkaddan activity as seen from Trend MicroÔ Smart ProtectionÔ Network
(SPN) data gathered from January 2020 to September 2021, we saw that India is the main target of one of
the APT’s most recent campaigns.

Earth Karkaddan Arrival Method
Earth Karkaddan’s most common arrival method is via malicious spam, which is a typical entry vector used
by other APT groups. The group can use a wide variety of lures, ranging from a fake government-related
document, to honeytraps with fake profiles of attractive women and coronavirus-related malspam.
Below is an example of an Earth Karkaddan phishing email with a malicious document attachment.

Figure 2. Example of a spear phishing email from Earth Karkaddan
The attached file is a Microsoft Office document that contains a malicious macro featuring fake Covid-19
information to lure victims into executing the macro:

Figure 3. The malicious attachment uses coronavirus-related information as a lure

Once the victim executes the macro, it will decrypt an embedded dropper executable that is hidden inside a
text box. The executable will be saved to a hardcoded path and will be executed in the victim’s machine.

decrypted file on a victim machine

Below is the encrypted executable hidden behind one of the text boxes in UserForm1:

Figure 5. Encrypted Crimson RAT executables hidden inside text boxes
Once the executable file is executed, it will proceed to unzip a file named mdkhm.zip and will execute the
Crimson RAT executable named dlrarhsiva.exe.

Crimson RAT Malware Analysis
Based on our observation, Crimson RAT is the most common malware used in Earth Karkaddan campaigns ,
with the main purpose of obtaining and exfiltrating information from targeted Windows systems and
uploading them to the attacker's C&C server.
The Earth Karkaddan APT group usually delivers this malware using a spear-phishing email with a malicious
document attachment to deceive a user into executing the said file manually and enabling its macros.
Upon execution, the Crimson RAT creates persistence using the following registry:
•
•

Registry: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Key: dlrarhsiva (This key is usually a random name)

Figure 7. Crimson RAT persistence mechanism
Like many other older RATs, Crimson RAT has also been cracked by threat actors and has been shared or
distributed underground. Thus, it’s important to note that a Crimson RAT infection may not always mean
that it is from an Earth Karkaddan campaign.
Based on our analysis, the Crimson RAT modules can steal credentials from web browsers on a victim
machine:

Figure 8. Crimson RAT steals web browser credentials
The malware contains minimal amounts of obfuscation and is compiled as a .NET binary. The simplicity and
lack of anti-analysis techniques on the final structure of the file could mean that it possibly did not come
from a well-funded organization. Below is a screenshot of the decompiled backdoor commands where it
can be seen that the original function names and variables are retained and minimally obfuscated.

Figure 9. Sample list of commands found in the Crimson RAT malware

The Crimson RAT and other malware (including Android RATs) used in Earth Karkaddan campaigns also
usually contain a command to list processes.

Figure 10. Crimson RAT command to list running processes on a victim machine
Crimson RAT has another backdoor command that lists running processes called “getavs.” Based on the
name of the command, it is possible that its purpose is to identify processes related to antivirus software.

Figure 11. The “getavs” backdoor command
Crimson RAT modules can also capture screenshots and keystrokes, while some variants can even collect
files from removable drives (such as USB drives).

Figure 12. Crimson RAT captures screenshots on a victim machine

Figure 13. Crimson RAT collects files from removable drives

Figure 14. Crimson RAT collects keystrokes
Below is an example of a network communication between the infected host and the Crimson RAT C&C
server. In this case, the Crimson RAT malware is trying to connect to the C&C server to send information
about the infected host, such as PC name, operating system (OS) information, and location of the malware
inside the system.

ObliqueRat Malware Analysis
Aside from the Crimson RAT malware, the Earth Karkaddan APT group is also known to use the ObliqueRat
malwareix in its campaigns.
This malware is also commonly distributed in spear-phishing campaigns using social engineering tactics to
lure victims into downloading another malicious document. In one of its most recent campaigns, the lure
used was that of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS) in New Delhi, India.

Figure 17. Initial spear-phishing document with a link to another malicious document
Once the victim clicks the link, it will download a document laced with a malicious macro. Upon enabling
the macro, it will then download the ObliqueRat malware that is hidden inside an image file.

Figure 18. The downloaded "1More-details.doc" contains malicious macros that will download and execute
the ObliqueRat malware in a victim’s machine
The macros inside the file will then download a bitmap image (BMP) file where the ObliqueRAT malware is
hidden, decode the downloaded BMP file, then create a persistence mechanism by creating a Startup URL
that will automatically run the ObliqueRAT malware.

Figure 19. Malicious macro codes will download, decode, and execute the ObliqueRat malware

Figure 20 shows a summary of the ObliqueRat malware’s infection chain:

domain

CapraRAT Malware Analysis
Aside from deploying Windows RATs, Earth Karkaddan is also known for using Android RATs to spy on their
targets.
This was particularly noted in a 2018 campaign wherein Earth Karkaddan targeted Pakistani activists and
civil society networks using an android spyware known as StealthAgent,x which is detected by Trend Micro
as AndroidOS_SMongo.HRX. A modified version of the open source AhMyth Android RAT was also used in
a 2020 Earth Karkaddan campaign that targeted Indian military and government personnel using fake porn
and Covid-19 tracking apps as lures.xi
We observed this group using another Android RAT — TrendMicro has named this “CapraRAT “ — ,” which
is possibly a modified version of an open-source RAT called AndroRAT. While analyzing this Android RAT,
we saw several similar capabilities to the CrimsonRat malware that the group usually used to infect
Windows systems.

We have been observing CapraRAT samples since 2017, and one of the first samples we analyzed (SHA256: d9979a41027fe790399edebe5ef8765f61e1eb1a4ee1d11690b4c2a0aa38ae42, detected by Trend
Micro as as AndroidOS_Androrat.HRXD) revealed some interesting things in that year: they used
"com.example.appcode.appcode" as the APK package name and used a possible public certificate
“74bd7b456d9e651fc84446f65041bef1207c408d,” which possibly meant the sample was used for testing,
and they were just starting to use it in their campaigns during that year.
The C&C domain android[.]viral91[.]xyz, to which the malware was connecting, also shows that the APT
team likely uses subdomains to host or connect to Android malware. In previous years, some CrimsonRAT
samples were also found to be hosted on the viral91[.]xyz domain.

Figure 22. CrimsonRAT malware hosted in viral91[.]xyz
We were also able to source a phishing document, “csd_car_price_list_2017,” that is related to this domain
and has been seen in the wild in 2017. This file name is interesting, as “csd” is likely to be associated to
"Canteen Stores Department" in Pakistan, which is operated by the Pakistani Ministry of Defence. This is a
possible lure for the Indian targets to open the malicious attachment, and was also used in a similar attack
in 2021.xii
The following are the details of one of the most recent Earth Karkaddan-related CapraRAT samples that we
have found in the wild:
•

SHA-256: 8cb542f5793279b8a11af28e9352f41d400856a28e40ed1daa323b47f9ea3e3c

Upon execution, the Andoid RAT will try to establish a connection with its C&C server,
209[.]127[.]19[.]241[:]10284. It is worth noting that this IP address contains the “WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8”
string in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) certificate which is commonly found in previously identified
Earth Karkaddan C&C servers, as noted in a recent blog by Team Cymru.xiii

Figure 23. Decompiled code from a CapraRAT connecting to its C&C server

It will then wait for commands from the C&C server and execute them.

Figure 25. Snippet of backdoor commands found in CapraRAT

This APK file also has the ability to drop mp4 or APK files from asset directory.

Figure 26. CapraRAT APK file drops an mp4 file
The RAT also has a persistence mechanism that always keeps the app active. It checks whether the service
is still running every minute, and if it is not, the service will be launched again.
