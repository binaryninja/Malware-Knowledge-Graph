UpdateAgent macOS Malware

Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.
We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.
Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.
In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.
Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?
UpdateAgent malware impacting a customer in the software industry, specific to
Apple’s macOS operating system.
1/5

The malware is used to deliver additional payloads and maintain a persistent foothold
on systems.
According to Microsoft, the malware has gone through several iterations since it first
appeared in September 2020.
In a recent case, analysts identified a suspicious launch agent and traced it to a shell
script matching UpdateAgent’s known behavior patterns and traits, including:
1. Use of CloudFront domains for C2 communications and secondary payloads.
2. Collection of system information (see below).
3. Removal of quarantine bit from payloads to bypass Gatekeeper.
4. Establishing persistence by modifying property list files in the user’s
/Library/LaunchAgents directory.
5. Removal of files from device to cover tracks.
UpdateAgent is known to deliver adware as its second stage payload, but there is
potential for more severe payload delivery.

Summary of UpdateAgent's Initiation Shell Script
UpdateAgent collects information about the system and submits it to the C2 domain
(hxxps://dgu8hufljhqqu[.]cloudfront[.]net/pkg) via HTTP POST request:
The information collected includes the active user, machine ID, operating system, and
version.

Then it, retrieves a DMG file from hxxps://duh59xv2mx0nn[.]cloudfront[.]net, adds the current
user to the ‘sudoers’ file and disables the password prompt:

Next, it clears extended attributes on the DMG file to bypass Gatekeeper, which is a security
feature in macOS aimed at reducing the likelihood of users accidentally running malware
downloaded from the internet.
Similar to the Mark-of-Web attribute in Windows, macOS applications (such as browsers)
add an extended attribute known as a quarantine flag to files downloaded from the internet.
UpdateAgent clears all extended attributes (including the quarantine flag) using the xattr
command.

Then, it uses PlistBuddy in direct mode to add arguments to a property list file.
(com.shenbfgbvgsfssfmrynamdzyetzfnd.plist) under the user’s /Library/LaunchAgents/ folder
for persistence:

Lastly, the cleanup actions show as follows:

How did we find it?
Our MDR for Endpoint service identified the launch agent persistence technique.

What did we do?
Our 24/7 SOC cyber analysts alerted the customer, isolated the host and provided
details of the infection to assist with remediation.

What can you learn from this TRU positive?
UpdateAgent is initiated by macOS users installing malicious software masquerading
as legitimate applications.
UpdateAgent has seen continuous improvement since it first emerged.
3/5

While adware payloads may seem low-risk, the potential for follow-on malware exists.
Additionally, the information collected and sent via UpdateAgent’s heartbeat
mechanism could be used to target the system for follow-on attacks.

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
Encourage good security hygiene among your users through phishing and security
awareness training.
Only download and install applications from trusted locations.
For additional protection, validate the file hash if the vendor provides the
hash information
Ignore unsolicited pop-ups or application download requests. Do not click on the
unsolicited pop-up links.
Monitor for modifications to plist files in auto-run locations such as
/Library/LaunchAgents/.
Restrict access/monitor for changes to sudoers file and launch agents folders.

Ask Yourself
1. What level of visibility do you have across your network, endpoint, and overall
environment to detect malicious behavior at scale?
2. What level of managed endpoint support do you have in place?
3. What level of managed endpoint support do you have in place?
4. Are you monitoring your endpoints 24/7 and what degree of control do you have to
initiate a kill switch when required?
