We are taking new steps against broadening threats to
democracy

August 21, 2018

It’s clear that democracies around the world are under attack. Foreign entities are launching
cyber strikes to disrupt elections and sow discord. Unfortunately, the internet has become an
avenue for some governments to steal and leak information, spread disinformation, and
probe and potentially attempt to tamper with voting systems. We saw this during the United
States general election in 2016, last May during the French presidential election, and now in
a broadening way as Americans are preparing for the November midterm elections.
Broadening cyberthreats to both U.S. political parties make clear that the tech sector will
need to do more to help protect the democratic process. Last week, Microsoft’s Digital
Crimes Unit (DCU) successfully executed a court order to disrupt and transfer control of six
internet domains created by a group widely associated with the Russian government and
known as Strontium, or alternatively Fancy Bear or APT28. We have now used this approach
12 times in two years to shut down 84 fake websites associated with this group. Attackers
want their attacks to look as realistic as possible and they therefore create websites and
URLs that look like sites their targeted victims would expect to receive email from or visit.
The sites involved in last week’s order fit this description.

We’re concerned that these and other attempts pose security threats to a broadening array
of groups connected with both American political parties in the run-up to the 2018 elections.
That’s why today we are expanding Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program with a new
initiative called Microsoft AccountGuard. This initiative will provide state-of-the-art
cybersecurity protection at no extra cost to all candidates and campaign offices at the
federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations we now
believe are under attack. The technology is free of charge to candidates, campaigns and
related political institutions using Office 365.
As a special master appointed by a federal judge concluded in the recent court order
obtained by DCU, there is “good cause” to believe that Strontium is “likely to continue” its
conduct. In the face of this continuing activity, we must work on the assumption that these
attacks will broaden further. An effective response will require even more work to bring
people and expertise together from across governments, political parties, campaigns and the
tech sector.
An expansion of political targets
Last week’s order transferred control of the six internet domains listed below from Strontium
to Microsoft, preventing Strontium from using them and enabling us to more closely look for
evidence of what Strontium intended to do with the domains. These six domains are listed
here:

Importantly, these domains show a broadening of entities targeted by Strontium’s activities.
One appears to mimic the domain of the International Republican Institute, which promotes
democratic principles and is led by a notable board of directors, including six Republican
senators and a leading senatorial candidate. Another is similar to the domain used by the
Hudson Institute, which hosts prominent discussions on topics including cybersecurity,
among other important activities. Other domains appear to reference the U.S. Senate but are
not specific to particular offices. To be clear, we currently have no evidence these domains
were used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred control of them, nor do we
have evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any planned attack involving
these domains.

Microsoft has notified both nonprofit organizations. Both have responded quickly, and
Microsoft will continue to work closely with them and other targeted organizations on
countering cybersecurity threats to their systems. We’ve also been monitoring and
addressing domain activity with Senate IT staff the past several months, following prior
attacks we detected on the staffs of two current senators.
Despite last week’s steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and
other sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks
across the political spectrum in the United States. Taken together, this pattern mirrors the
type of activity we saw prior to the 2016 election in the United States and the 2017 election in
France.
Our new Microsoft AccountGuard initiative
AccountGuard will provide three services that will cover both organizational and personal
email accounts:
1. Threat notification across accounts. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center will
enable Microsoft to detect and provide notification of attacks in a unified way across
both organizational and personal email systems. For political campaigns and other
eligible organizations, when an attack is identified, this will provide a more
comprehensive view of attacks against campaign staff. When verifiable threats are
detected, Microsoft will provide personal and expedited recommendations to
campaigns and campaign staff to secure their systems.
2. Security guidance and ongoing education. Officials, campaigns and related political
organizations will receive guidance to help make their networks and email systems
more secure. This can include applying multi-factor authentication, installing the latest
security updates and guidance for setting up systems that ensure only those people
who need data and documents can access them. AccountGuard will provide updated
briefings and training to address evolving cyberattack trends.
3. Early adopter opportunities. Microsoft will provide preview releases of new security
features on a par with the services offered to our large corporate and government
account customers.
You can read a more complete description of Microsoft AccountGuard in today’s blog by Tom
Burt, the corporate vice president who heads Microsoft’s Customer Security and Trust group.
Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program
Since we launched Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program in April, we have focused on
four priorities: protecting campaigns from hacking, protecting voting and the electoral
process, increasing political advertising transparency, and defending against disinformation
campaigns. In the coming months, we will offer AccountGuard in additional countries, as we
continue to invest in and evolve other aspects of the Defending Democracy Program.

Our Defending Democracy Program is an important piece of our work to protect customers
and promote cyberdiplomacy around the world. While cybersecurity starts with Microsoft and
other companies in the tech sector, it’s ultimately a shared responsibility with customers and
governments around the world. Together with our industry partners, we’ve launched the
Cybersecurity Tech Accord, now endorsed by 44 leading tech companies to protect and
empower civilians online and to improve the security, stability and resilience of cyberspace.
And we will continue to call for stronger adherence to existing international norms and the
creation of new international laws – like a Digital Geneva Convention.
As last week’s court order and today’s AccountGuard initiative reflect, we are committed not
only to stronger principles and laws but stronger action as well.
A democracy requires vigilance
In 1787, as the American constitutional convention reached its conclusion in Philadelphia,
Benjamin Franklin was asked as he departed Independence Hall what type of government
the delegates had created. He famously replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.”
We can only keep our democratic societies secure if candidates can run campaigns and
voters can go to the polls untainted by foreign cyberattacks.
Democracy requires vigilance and at times action by citizens to protect and maintain it. No
individual or company can hope to meet this imperative by itself. We all need to do our part.
We’re committed to doing our part by helping to protect candidates and campaigns in
preserving their voices and votes no matter what party they support.
