Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU, conducted cyber reconnaissance against
officials and organisations at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games due to take place in
Tokyo this summer before they were postponed, the UK has revealed today.
The targets included the Games’ organisers, logistics services and sponsors.
The attacks on the 2020 Summer Games are the latest in a campaign of Russian malicious
cyber activity against the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The UK is confirming for the first time today the extent of GRU targeting of the 2018 Winter
Olympic and Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea.
The GRU’s cyber unit attempted to disguise itself as North Korean and Chinese hackers
when it targeted the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Games.
It went on to target broadcasters, a ski resort, Olympic officials and sponsors of the games in
2018.
The GRU deployed data-deletion malware against the Winter Games IT systems and
targeted devices across the Republic of Korea using VPNFilter.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre)) assesses that
the incident was intended to sabotage the running of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic
Games, as the malware was designed to wipe data from and disable computers and
networks.
Administrators worked to isolate the malware and replace the affected computers, preventing
potential disruption.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:
The GRU’s actions against the Olympic and Paralympic Games are cynical and
reckless. We condemn them in the strongest possible terms.
The UK will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious
cyber attacks.
The UK has already acted against the GRU’s destructive cyber unit by working with
international partners to impose asset freezes and travel bans against its members through
the EU cyber sanctions regime.
Today (Monday 19 October), the US Department of Justice has announced criminal charges
against Russian military intelligence officers working for the GRU’s destructive cyber unit –
also known by the codenames Sandworm and VoodooBear – for conducting cyber attacks
against the 2018 Winter Games and other cyber attacks, including the 2018 spear phishing
attacks against the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL (Defence
Science and Technology Laboratory)).
The UK attributed the attacks against DSTL (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory),
which followed the Salisbury poisonings, to Russia in 2018.

Background
These cyber attacks were committed by the GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies,
GTsST also known by its field post number 74455 and known in open source as:
Sandworm
BlackEnergy Group
Telebots
VoodooBear
Iron Viking
Quedagh
Electrum
Industroyer

Winter
Olympics,
February
2018

GTsST actors launched a significant campaign against the
Winter Olympic games, which included the use of Olympic
Destroyer malware. This malware targeted the Winter Olympic
and Paralympic Games. NCSC (National Cyber Security
Centre) assess that the intent behind the incident was almost
certainly sabotage as the malware was designed to wipe data
from and disable computers and networks. Disruption to the
Winter Olympics could have been greater if it had not been for
administrators who worked to isolate the malware and replace
affected computers. More broadly, the GTsST actors targeted
multiple entities across South Korea (and the world) which
were linked with the Winter Olympics. This activity utilised a
range of capabilities known to be used by the GTsST. This
includes targeting of: officials, sponsors, a ski resort, official
service providers, and broadcasters

6 hours

exposed this attack as
the work of the GRU in
February 2020

Shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, also
known as CrashOverride. It resulted in a fifth
of Kyiv losing power for an hour. It is the first
known malware designed specifically to
disrupt electricity grids

Destructive cyber attack targeting the
Ukrainian financial, energy and government
sectors and affecting other European and
Russian businesses

sanctioned the GRU unit
for this attack in July

Ransomware encrypted hard drives and
rendered IT inoperable. This caused disruption
including to the Kyiv metro, Odessa airport,
Russia’s central bank and two Russian media
outlets

VPNFILTER malware infected thousands of
home and small business routers and network
devices worldwide. The infection potentially
allowed attackers to control infected devices,
render them inoperable and intercept or block
network traffic

In April 2018, the NCSC
(National Cyber Security
Centre), FBI and
Department for
Homeland Security
issued a joint Technical
Alert exposing that the
GRU was responsible

The GRU attempted to use its cyber
capabilities to gain access to the UK’s
Defence and Science Technology Laboratory
(DSTL (Defence Science and Technology
Laboratory)) computer systems

The GRU attempted to compromise the UK
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)
computer systems via a spearphishing attack

UK government publicly
exposed this attack as
the work of the GRU in
October 2018

The GRU carried out large scale disruptive
cyber-attacks against Georgian web hosting
providers that resulted in widespread
defacement of websites, including sites
belonging to the Georgian Government,
courts, NGOs, media and businesses, and
also interrupted the service of several national
broadcasters

UK government publicly
exposed this attack as
the work of the GRU in
February 2020

The National Cyber Security Centre has assessed with high confidence that all of these
attacks were almost certainly (95%+) carried out by the unit known as the Main Centre for
Special Technologies (GTsST) also known as Unit 74455 of the GRU.
