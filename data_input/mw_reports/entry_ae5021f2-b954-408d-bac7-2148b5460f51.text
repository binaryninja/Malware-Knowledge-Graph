Tampa, Florida – Acting United States Attorney Karin Hoppmann announces the extradition
of Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev (28, Chernivtsi, Ukraine) in connection with charges of
conspiracy, trafficking in unauthorized access devices, and trafficking in computer
passwords. If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum penalty of 17 years in federal
prison. The indictment also notifies Ivanov-Tolpintsev that the United States intends to forfeit
$82,648, which is alleged to be traceable to proceeds of the offenses.
Ivanov-Tolpintsev was taken into custody by Polish authorities in Korczowa, Poland, on
October 3, 2020, and extradited to the United States pursuant to the extradition treaty
between the United States and the Republic of Poland. Ivanov-Tolpintsev was presented on
September 7, 2021, before United States Magistrate Julie S. Sneed, and ordered detained

According to the indictment, Ivanov-Tolpintsev controlled a “botnet,” which is a network of
computers infected with malware and controlled as a group without the owners’ knowledge.
He used the botnet to conduct brute-force attacks designed to decrypt numerous computer
login credentials simultaneously. During the course of the conspiracy, Ivanov-Tolpintsev
stated that his botnet was capable of decrypting the login credentials of at least 2,000
computers every week. Ivanov-Tolpintsev then sold these login credentials on a dark web
website that specialized in the purchase and sale of access to compromised computers.
Once sold on this website, credentials were used to facilitate a wide range of illegal activity,
including tax fraud and ransomware attacks.
An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed one or more
violations of federal criminal law, and every defendant is presumed innocent unless, and
until, proven guilty.
The investigation was led by the Tampa Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
Internal Revenue Service—Criminal Investigation’s Tampa Field Office, and Homeland
Security Investigations - Tampa Division. Substantial assistance was provided by the
Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service—
Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit in Washington, D.C. This investigation also
benefited from foreign law enforcement cooperation by the Polish National Police, the Polish
Prosecutor’s Office, and the Polish Ministry of Justice. It will be prosecuted by Assistant
United States Attorney Carlton C. Gammons.
