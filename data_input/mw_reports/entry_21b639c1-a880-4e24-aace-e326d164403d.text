Attackers behind the Arid Viper and the Yanbian Gang exploited sex
content for their campaigns against victims in Israel and Kuwait,
and South Korea.
Security experts at Trend Micro have uncovered a cyber espionage campaign, dubbed
Operation Arid Viper, that targeted Israeli institutions. The Operation Arid Viper is run by
Arab-speaking hackers that sought to extract sensitive documents by sending phishing
emails. The phishing campaigns targeted government office, infrastructure providers, a
military organization and academic institutions in Israel and Kuwait
The particularity of the Operation Arid Viper is represented by the tactic adopted by the
attackers to lure victims. The malicious emails sent by hackers include a malware packaged
with a short pornographic video.
“This month, actors of Operation Arid Viper and members of the Yanbian Gang jumped on
the sexually explicit content bandwagon, using them in separate attacks that target
respective victims in Israel and Kuwait, and South Korea. Operation Arid Viper attacked five
Israeli-based organizations in the government, transport, infrastructure, military, and
academic industries, and one organization in Kuwait using spear-phishing emails that
dropped a pornographic video on a victim’s computer.” reported Trend Micro in a blog post.

The attackers exploit the fact that targeted individuals who might be receiving pornographic
video at work and so would hesitate to report the incident, this circumstance allow the
malware to remain undetected.
“These victims’ failure to act on the threat could have then allowed the main malware to
remain undiscovered.” states Trend Micro. “It targeted professionals who might be receiving
very inappropriate content at work and so would hesitate to report the incident.“
The malware used by Arid Viper once infected the victims’ PC searched for Microsoft Office
files and text files. It reported the located files to the command and control server, which then
decided which files to exfiltrate from the machine.
Unfortunately, researchers at Trend Micro reported that the command and control servers
used by Arid Viper were “closely locked down, providing a very little hint that could aid our
investigation.”
The researchers have found a few similarities between the Arid Viper campaign and
the Advtravel, including the control infrastructure and the attack kill chain.
The infection Chains for both Operation Arid Viper and Advtravel started with spear-phishing
emails that came with a .RAR file attachment that automatically extracts an .SCR file that
drops two files when executed.
The Advtravel campaign infected more than 500 systems, the majority of them located in
Egypt. The hackers were focused on grabbing screen images from victims’ computers, in an
attempt to identify victims. Anyway, the experts at Trend Micro consider the operators behind
the Advtravel campaign much less skilled than Arid Viper.
“This could be a sign that they are looking for incriminating or compromising images for
blackmail purposes,” Trend Micro reports. “As such, the attackers may be less-skilled
hackers who are not after financial gain nor hacking for espionage purposes.”

“The first file is a pornographic video clip, which serves as a social engineering bait while the
second file is the actual malware connecting to the C&C servers. Once the second-stage
malware is in the system, it sets itself to autorun each time the systems reboot, even posing
as an Internet communication software. “
The researchers are spending a great effort in the investigation of the Arid Viper gang, in
particular on the way they organized the command and control infrastructure, they suspect a
link with possible threat actors to the Gaza Strip. They suggest the existence of a supraorganization behind both campaigns despite they presented different complexity of TTPs.
“Although the malware involved in operation Advtravel is different from that of Operation Arid
Viper, both operations still have a few similarities, such as sharing the same server and
having the domains used in Advtravel registered with the same emails as the Operation Arid
Viper. Notably, the same server and site registration details suggest the existence of a supraorganization, a forum or an influential sponsor could be providing various hacking groups
with the means to pursue their ends.”

Bypassing the Iron Dome”
