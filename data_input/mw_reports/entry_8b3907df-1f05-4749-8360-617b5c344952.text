Karakurt Data Extortion Group
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-152a

Summary
Actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from ransomware:
• Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.
• Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts.
• Enforce multifactor authentication.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to
provide information on the Karakurt data extortion group, also known as the Karakurt Team
and Karakurt Lair. Karakurt actors have employed a variety of tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Karakurt
victims have not reported encryption of compromised machines or files; rather, Karakurt
actors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it to the public
unless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. Known ransom demands have
ranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire
within a week of first contact with the victim.
Karakurt actors have typically provided screenshots or copies of stolen file directories as
proof of stolen data. Karakurt actors have contacted victims’ employees, business partners,
and clients [T1591.002] with harassing emails and phone calls to pressure the victims to
cooperate. The emails have contained examples of stolen data, such as social security
numbers, payment accounts, private company emails, and sensitive business data belonging
to employees or clients. Upon payment of ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some
form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a brief statement explaining how the initial
intrusion occurred.
Prior to January 5, 2022, Karakurt operated a leaks and auction website found at
https://karakurt[.]group. The domain and IP address originally hosting the website went
offline in the spring 2022. The website is no longer accessible on the open internet, but has
been reported to be located elsewhere in the deep web and on the dark web. As of May
2022, the website contained several terabytes of data purported to belong to victims across
North America and Europe, along with several “press releases” naming victims who had not
paid or cooperated, and instructions for participating in victim data “auctions.”

Technical Details
Initial Intrusion
Karakurt does not appear to target any specific sectors, industries, or types of victims. During
reconnaissance [TA0043], Karakurt actors appear to obtain access to victim devices
primarily:
By purchasing stolen login credentials [T1589.001] [T1589.002];
Via cooperating partners in the cybercrime community, who provide Karakurt access to
already compromised victims; or
Through buying access to already compromised victims via third-party intrusion broker
networks [T1589.001].
Note: Intrusion brokers, or intrusion broker networks, are malicious individual
cyber actors or groups of actors who use a variety of tools and skills to obtain
initial access to—and often create marketable persistence within—protected
computer systems. Intrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised
computer systems to other cybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in
ransomware, business email compromise, corporate and government espionage,
etc.
Common intrusion vulnerabilities exploited for initial access [TA001] in Karakurt events
include the following:
Outdated SonicWall SSL VPN appliances [T1133] are vulnerable to multiple recent
CVEs
Log4j “Log4Shell” Apache Logging Services vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) [T1190]
Phishing and spearphishing [T1566]
Malicious macros within email attachments [T1566.001]
Stolen virtual private network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials
[T1078]
Outdated Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances [T1133]/firewall appliances [T1190]
are vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs
Outdated and/or unserviceable Microsoft Windows Server instances
Network Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Persistence, and Exfiltration
Upon developing or obtaining access to a compromised system, Karakurt actors deploy
Cobalt Strike beacons to enumerate a network [T1083], install Mimikatz to pull plain-text
credentials [T1078], use AnyDesk to obtain persistent remote control [T1219], and utilize
additional situation-dependent tools to elevate privileges and move laterally within a network.
Karakurt actors then compress (typically with 7zip) and exfiltrate large sums of data—and, in
many cases, entire network-connected shared drives in volumes exceeding 1 terabyte (TB)
—using open source applications and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services [T1048], such as
2/10

Filezilla, and cloud storage services including rclone and Mega.nz [T1567.002].
Extortion
Following the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by
way of “readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email
networks, and emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. The ransom
notes reveal the victim has been hacked by the “Karakurt Team” and threaten public release
or auction of the stolen data. The instructions include a link to a TOR URL with an access
code. Visiting the URL and inputting the access code open a chat application over which
victims can negotiate with Karakurt actors to have their data deleted.
Karakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which
employees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning
the recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the
dissemination of victim data. These communications often included samples of stolen data—
primarily personally identifiable information (PII), such as employment records, health
records, and financial business records.
Victims who negotiate with Karakurt actors receive a “proof of life,” such as screenshots
showing file trees of allegedly stolen data or, in some cases, actual copies of stolen files.
Upon reaching an agreement on the price of the stolen data with the victims, Karakurt actors
provided a Bitcoin address—usually a new, previously unused address—to which ransom
payments could be made. Upon receiving the ransom, Karakurt actors provide some form of
alleged proof of deletion of the stolen files, such as a screen recording of the files being
deleted, a deletion log, or credentials for a victim to log into a storage server and delete the
files themselves.
Although Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep
the incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the
confidentiality of victim information after a ransom was paid. Note: the U.S. government
strongly discourages the payment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber
criminals promising to delete stolen files in exchange for payments.
In some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked
by other ransomware variants. In such cases, Karakurt actors likely purchased or otherwise
obtained previously stolen data. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time
these victims were under attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received
ransom notes from multiple ransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors
purchased access to a compromised system that was also sold to another ransomware
actor.

3/10

Karakurt actors have also exaggerated the degree to which a victim had been compromised
and the value of data stolen. For example, in some instances, Karakurt actors claimed to
steal volumes of data far beyond the storage capacity of compromised systems or claimed to
steal data that did not belong to the victim.

Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location
(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).
Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited
interruption to the organization.
Regularly back up data and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the
data resides.
Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts and enable real time
detection.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
updates/patches are released.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with
least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.
Disable unused ports.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Enforce multi-factor authentication.
Use National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing
and managing password policies.
Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64
characters in length;
Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password
managers;
Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;
Avoid reusing passwords;
Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;
Disable password “hints”;
Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per
year. Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of
requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are
more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can
easily decipher.
Require administrator credentials to install software.
Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing
and using a VPN.
Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training
on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging
cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).
