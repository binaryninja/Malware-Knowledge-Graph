27 January 2021|PRESS RELEASE

Joint Eurojust Europol Press Release

Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide have this week disrupted one of
the most significant botnets of the past decade: EMOTET. Investigators have now
taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action.
This operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands,
Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine,
with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. This operation was carried

1/4

out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats
(EMPACT).
EMOTET has been one of the professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there.
First discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for
cybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary
door opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was
established, these were sold to other top level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities
such as data theft and extortion through ransomware.
Spread via Word documents

The EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a
fully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims’ computers via
infected e-mail attachments. A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users
into opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also
been presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19.
All these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or
downloadable by clicking on a link within the email. Once a user opened one of these
documents, they could be prompted to “enable macros” so that the malicious code hidden in
the Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim’s computer.
Attacks for hire

2/4

EMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that
the malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware,
such as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim’s computer.
This type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the
biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk
have benefited from it.
Its unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to
just a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild.
Disruption of EMOTET’s infrastructure
The infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located
across the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the
computers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and
to ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts.
To severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to
create an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week’s action where by law
enforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from
the inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law
enforcement-controlled infrastructure. This is a unique and new approach to effectively
disrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime.
How to protect oneself against loaders
Many botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware
changes its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the
computer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection,
allowing the infection to go initially undetected.
A combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and
cybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like
EMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and
especially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it
likely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs.
As part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a
database containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was
discovered. You can check if your e-mail address has been compromised at

notification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed
worldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).
