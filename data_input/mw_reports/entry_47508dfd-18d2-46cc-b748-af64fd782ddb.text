Recent news reports of a “ransomware” campaign targeting Ukraine has resulted in
significant press coverage regarding not only attribution but also possible motive. Unlike
traditional ransomware campaigns where the motive is obvious, this campaign is believed
to be pseudo in nature. In other words, the intention is likely to cause destruction of infected
systems since the wiper at stage 4 simply overwrites data on the victim’s system, meaning
1/8

no decryption is possible. The malicious software drops a fake ransomware note while
overwriting the master boot record in the background. The ransom note contains a Bitcoin
address to send the ransom payment and contains a Tox ID to contact the threat actor. The
infection process is carried out using the publicly available Impacket tool.
While the WhisperGate malware was initially detected in attacks against Ukraine, additional
detections have started to be seen across the globe. The Trellix Advanced Threat Research
Team has put together the following analysis of WhisperGate.

Recommended Steps to Mitigate against WhisperGate
The advisory released by the CISA provides several recommendations to secure your
environment against WhisperGate that were gathered from their analysis of malware
samples discovered in the wild.
Validate that all remote access to the organization’s network and privileged or
administrative access requires multi-factor authentication.

2/8

Ensure that software is up to date, prioritizing updates that address vulnerabilities
being exploited.
Disable all ports and protocols that are not essential for business purposes.
Ensure that Cloud Service security controls have been reviewed and implemented.

Open-Source Tools Being Observed in Attacks
An open-source tool being observed in attacks using WhisperGate is Impacket. Impacket is
a collection of Python scripts that can be used by an attacker to target Windows network
protocols. This tool can be used to enumerate users, capture hashes, move laterally and
escalate privileges. Impacket has also been used by APT groups, in particular Wizard
Spider and Stone Panda.
In the observed intrusions related to WhisperGate, the malware executes via Impacket to
assist threat actors in lateral movement and execution.

WhisperGate Threat Intelligence from the Trellix Advanced Threat Research Team
and MVISION Insights
MVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for
WhisperGate. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and Process Traces that have been
observed and systems that require additional attention to prevent widespread infection.

MVISION EDR is currently alerting to the activity associated with WhisperGate and will note
the MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to the adversary activity.

Securing Cloud Services Against Attacks with MVISION Cloud
One of the recommendations by the CISA to mitigate against WhisperGate attacks is to
ensure that cloud services and infrastructure are configured properly, and vulnerabilities
patched. The Cloud Security controls provided in MVISION Cloud/UCE allow for

vulnerability scans and configuration audits of your cloud environment. Identifying areas of
risks are critical to not allowing adversaries to gain initial access.

Trellix offers Threat Intelligence Briefings along with Cloud Security and Data Protection
workshops to provide customers with best practice recommendations on how to utilize their
existing security controls to protect against adversarial and insider threats, please reach out
if you would like to schedule a workshop with your organization.
