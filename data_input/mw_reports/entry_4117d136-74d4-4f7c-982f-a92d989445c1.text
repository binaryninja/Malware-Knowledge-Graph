Microsoft Windows 11 help Files have Vidar Spyware
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/vidar-distributed-through-backdoored-windows-11-downloads-and-abusing

Summary
In April 2022, ThreatLabz discovered several newly registered domains, which were created by a threat actor to spoof the official Microsoft
Windows 11 OS download portal. We discovered these domains by monitoring suspicious traffic in our Zscaler cloud. The spoofed sites were
created to distribute malicious ISO files which lead to a Vidar infostealer infection on the endpoint. These variants of Vidar malware fetch the
C2 configuration from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and Mastodon network.
ThreatLabz believes that the same threat actor is actively leveraging social engineering to impersonate popular legitimate software
applications to distribute Vidar malware, as we have also identified an attacker-controlled GitHub repository which hosts several backdoored
versions of Adobe Photoshop. These binaries hosted on GitHub, distribute Vidar malware using similar tactics of abusing social media
channels for C2 communication.
In this blog, ThreatLabz analyzes the Vidar distribution vector, threat actor correlation, and technical analysis of the binaries involved in this
campaign.

Key points
ThreatLabz discovered several newly registered domains spoofing the official Microsoft Windows 11 OS download portal
The spoofed domains were distributing malicious ISO files containing samples of the Vidar infostealer malware
The actual C2s used by the malware samples are obtained from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and
Mastodon network
Using data obtained from this campaign, ThreatLabz was also able to identify another similar one using backdoored versions of Adobe
Photoshop

Distribution Vector - Windows 11 Theme
The threat actor registered several domains beginning 20th April 2022 that host web pages that masquerade as the official Microsoft Windows
11 download page, which is the latest version of the operating system. ThreatLabz found several other domains registered by this threat actor
similar to the one shown below in Figure 1. All of these domains were used to spread malicious ISO files spoofed as a Windows 11 download.

The complete list of domains linked to this threat actor that were used in this campaign are mentioned in the Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
section.

Technical Analysis
ISO file
The binary inside the ISO file is a PE32 binary. The size of the ISO file is very large (more than 300 MB), which helps the attackers evade
network security products where there is a file size limitation in place. Example MD5 hashes for this campaign are shown below:
ISO file MD5 hash: 52c47fdda399b011b163812c46ea94a6
PE32 file MD5 hash: 6352540cf679dfec21aff6bd9dee3770
The binary inside the ISO file is digitally signed with a certificate by AVAST. However, this certificate is expired and hence invalid.
Figure 2 shows the details of the certificate and the corresponding serial number.

2/13

Figure 2: Details of the certificate used to sign the malicious Vidar binary
All of the binaries in this campaign were signed by a certificate with the same serial number. By pivoting on this serial number, we were able to
discover several other malicious binaries from multiple different campaigns and actors, which likely indicates that this is a stolen certificate
coming from the AVAST compromise back in 2019.

Vidar Samples
The Vidar samples in these campaigns are all packed with Themida (except for the MD5 hash 6ae17cb76cdf097d4dc4fcccfb5abd8a) and over
330MB in size. However, the sample contains a PE file that is only around 3.3MB. Figure 3 shows that the rest of the file content is just
artificially filled up with 0x10 bytes to increase the file’s size. The Vidar strings extracted from these samples is provided in the Appendix
section at the end of the blog.

All of the binaries below are related to the same Windows 11 theme campaign:

MD5: 6352540cf679dfec21aff6bd9dee3770

The Vidar static configuration below contains the embedded parameters needed by the sample to communicate with its C2 and information
including the malware version:
Profile: 670
Profile ID: 739
Version: 51.9
URL marker: hello
URL1: https://t.me/btc20220425
Real C2: 195.201.250.209 (Carved out from URL1)
URL2: https://ieji.de/@ronxik213
Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)
The botnet can be identified by its profile ID. Both of the hardcoded URLs are from social media sites. However, they are used as a dead drop
resolver as a first stage. The URL marker instructs Vidar to parse the second stage URL from the social media profiles located at the dead
drop resolver.
The following is an example Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from the C2:
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,250,Default;%DESKTOP%\;*.txt:*.dat:*wallet*.*:*2fa*.*:*backup*.*:*code*.*:*password*.*:*auth*.*:*google*.*:*utc*.*:*UTC*.*:*cryp
This configuration is the default with every stealing function enabled (passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, two-factor authentication, etc)
The following libraries are downloaded from the C2:
update.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d), which contains the following DLL libraries:
freebl3.dll (ef2834ac4ee7d6724f255beaf527e635)
mozglue.dll (8f73c08a9660691143661bf7332c3c27)
msvcp140.dll (109f0f02fd37c84bfc7508d4227d7ed5)
nss3.dll (bfac4e3c5908856ba17d41edcd455a51)
softokn3.dll (a2ee53de9167bf0d6c019303b7ca84e5)
sqlite3.dll (e477a96c8f2b18d6b5c27bde49c990bf)
vcruntime140.dll (7587bf9cb4147022cd5681b015183046)
All of these libraries are legitimate that Vidar leverages in order to extract credentials and other data from different applications and browsers.

MD5: da82d43043c101f25633c258f527c9d5
MD5: e9a3562f3851dd2dba27f90b5b2d15c0
Vidar static configuration:
Profile: 1281
Profile ID: 755
Version: 51.9
URL marker: hello
URL1: 5.252.178.50
URL2: https://koyu.space/@ronxik123
Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)
For these samples, the URL1 field in the static configuration is a real C2, and a social media profile is used as a backup URL.
The Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from this C2 was the following:
1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,250,none;
This configuration is customized to extract social media passwords with all of the other Vidar features disabled.
The libraries downloaded from the C2 are the same as the previous sample with the same update.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d).

Distribution Vector - Adobe Photoshop Theme
ThreatLabz also identified an attacker-controlled GitHub repository which hosts backdoored versions of the application Adobe Photoshop
Creative Cloud, which we attribute to the same threat actor. Figure 4 shows the GitHub repository (https://github.com/AdobeInstal) used by the
attacker to host a backdoored version of Adobe Photoshop.

Technical Analysis
The sample with the MD5 hash below belongs to this Adobe Photoshop theme campaign.

MD5 6ae17cb76cdf097d4dc4fcccfb5abd8a
Vidar static configuration:
Profile: 1199
Profile ID: 0
Version: 51.8
URL marker: hello
URL1: https://t.me/mm20220428
Real C2: 195.201.250.209 (Carved out from URL1)
URL2: https://koyu.space/@ronxik123
Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)
The Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from the C2 was the following:
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,250,Default;%DESKTOP%\;*.txt:*.dat:*wallet*.*:*2fa*.*:*backup*.*:*code*.*:*password*.*:*auth*.*:*google*.*:*utc*.*:*UTC*.*:*cryp
The libraries downloaded from the C2 are the same as the previous sample with the same update.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d).

Social media abuse for C2 communication
All the binaries involved in this campaign fetch the IP addresses of the C2 servers from attacker-registered social media accounts on the
Telegram and Mastodon networks. In the past, the threat actors distributing Vidar have abused other social media networks such as Mastodon.
However, the abuse of Telegram is a new tactic that they added to their arsenal.

Telegram abuse
In these campaigns, the threat actor created several Telegram channels with the C2 IP address in the channel description. The format used to
store the C2 IP address on social media profiles is the following for this campaign:
<C2_Url_Marker> <C2_IP_address>|
The C2_Url_Marker field in these campaigns was hello. The naming convention for the Telegram channels includes a date that corresponds to
the date when these channels were created. As an example, the channel with the handle btc20220425 corresponds to a channel created on
April 25, 2022, using btc_stacking as the name as shown in Figure 5.

Mastodon network abuse
The Mastodon network is a decentralized social network which allows anyone to deploy their own instance of a self-hosted online community.
There are several instances of such online communities on the Internet, which are built using Mastodon. Two such instances are ieji[.]de and
koyu[.]space. The threat actor created a profile on both of these communities and stored the C2 IP address in the profile section using a format
similar to the one used for Telegram channels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the profiles created by the threat actor on ieji[.]de and koyu[.]space,
respectively.

Conclusion
The threat actors distributing Vidar malware have demonstrated their ability to social engineer victims into installing Vidar stealer using themes
related to the latest popular software applications. As always, users should be cautious when downloading software applications from the
Internet and download software only from the official vendor websites. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this campaign, as
well as others, to help keep our customers safe.
