Quarterly report: Incident Response trends in Summer
2020

By David Liebenberg and Caitlin Huey.
For the fourth quarter in a row, Ryuk dominated the threat landscape in incident response.
As we mentioned in last quarter’s report, Ryuk has shifted from relying on commodity trojans
to using living-off-the-land tools. This has led to a decrease in observations of attacks

leveraging commodity trojans. Email remained the top infection vector, though we observe
increased compromises of remote desktop services (RDS) as well as Citrix devices and
Pulse VPN. One of the more interesting trends this quarter was the role of the COVID-19
pandemic. Interestingly, we did not observe any engagements in which COVID-19 was used
in an attack. However, CTIR has observed the pandemic impacting organizations, affecting
their ability to respond and contain cybersecurity incidents.

Targeting
A wide variety of verticals were once again targeted, including energy and utilities, financial
services, government, health care, industrial distribution, manufacturing, retail, technology,
telecommunications, and transportation. The top targeted verticals were health care and
technology, a change from last quarter when the top targeted verticals were financial
services and government.

Threats
Ransomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. As mentioned
above, contrary to previous quarters, CTIR is observing fewer engagements in which Emotet
and Trickbot function as the initial dropper for Ryuk. This is one reason why we observed far
fewer attacks leveraging commodity trojans this quarter. As mentioned last quarter, Ryuk
attacks evolved in other ways as well, leveraging encoded PowerShell commands to
download the initial payload, disable security/AV tools, stop backups, and scan the entire
network and provide an output of online vs. offline hosts. Ryuk adversaries are using more
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and BitsAdmin to deploy the malware in
addition to PsExec.
For example, a government organization had thousands of systems encrypted with Ryuk
ransomware, affecting nearly 2,000 systems and critical services. There was no evidence of
any presence of commodity trojans during the attack. The adversaries compromised a
domain administrator account by recovering the password stored in a Group Policy. The
adversaries attempted to prevent file restoration by using bcdedit to alter boot configuration
data to prevent system recovery, deleted Windows shadow copies, and used vssadmin to
remove system restore points. The adversaries then tried to expand the number of affected
hosts by granting full permission for all users for all files on all mounted disk drives with
icacls.exe. They also sent Wake-On-Lan magic packets to wake shut-down hosts for
encryption.
The adversaries used PowerShell to disable real-time monitoring malware protection and a
PowerShell cmdlet code “Get-DataInfo.ps1” to scan the network and provide an output of live
or dead hosts in text files. The adversaries used the command-line tool BitsAdmin, as well as
2/3

WMIC and PsExec with privileged account credentials to copy Ryuk to additional hosts.
In another engagement where CTIR identified a Ryuk infection, the initial compromise was
performed with a phishing email that contained an encrypted Microsoft Word document. The
malicious code had been embedded in a chess game written in VBA, and once the
document was opened, it created a VBS file and executed it through PowerShell. The VBS
file downloaded and executed the malicious payload identified as Detplock, a remote access
trojan (RAT).
CTIR continued to observe ransomware actors exfiltrating sensitive data as another lever to
further compel victims to pay the ransom. This is a continuation of a trend since Winter 2019.

Initial vectors
For the majority of engagements, definitively identifying an initial vector was difficult due to
shortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,
or reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector. CTIR also observed
several instances in which adversaries leveraged brute-force attacks against a victim
organization’s RDS. These types of attacks may be related to the increased threat surface
due to remote work stemming from COVID-19 as well as an increase in Phobos ransomware
attacks, which typically leverage compromised RDS connections as an initial vector. CTIR
also continued to observe multiple compromises of Citrix Application Discovery Controller
and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2019-19781) and Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-2019-11510).

COVID-19
Somewhat surprisingly, CTIR has not observed any engagements in which COVID-19 was
leveraged, despite the fact that threat actors have been increasingly using COVID-19-related
information as lures in phishing and malspam attacks. However, CTIR has observed the
pandemic impacting organizations, particularly in the health care industry, affecting their
ability to respond and contain cybersecurity incidents since pre-COVID-19 incident response
planning did not account for a pandemic occurring along with a parallel cybersecurity
incident. Limitations in travel, personnel, and budget all contributed to increased difficulty
mitigating incidents, which was observed across multiple incident response engagements in
Summer 2020. Additionally, CTIR has observed organizations updating their internal IR and
business continuity planning in response to the pandemic. This illustrates the importance of
developing a robust incident response plan and maintaining flexibility to make adjustments in
response to major global events. Despite a lack of COVID-19-themed campaigns, the
pandemic has still increased the threat surface, with an obvious uptick in both RDS and VPN
services due to increased remote work. Beyond providing new avenues for adversaries to
target, CTIR has also responded by working with victim organizations in identifying the new
network “baseline” caused by these changes.
