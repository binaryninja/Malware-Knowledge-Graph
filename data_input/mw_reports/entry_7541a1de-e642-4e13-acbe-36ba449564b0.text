Key Findings
Malicious use of Cobalt Strike in threat actor campaigns is increasing.
Threat actor use of Cobalt Strike increased 161 percent from 2019 to 2020 and
remains a high-volume threat in 2021.
Cobalt Strike is currently used by more cybercrime and general commodity malware
operators than APT and espionage threat actors.

Overview
In 2021, Cobalt Strike is appearing in Proofpoint threat data more frequently than
ever. Cobalt Strike is a legitimate security tool used by penetration testers to emulate threat
actor activity in a network. However, it is also increasingly used by malicious actors –
Proofpoint saw a 161 percent increase in threat actor use of the tool from 2019 to 2020. This
aligns with observations from other security firms as more threat actors adopt hacking tools
in their operations.
When mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Proofpoint’s visibility into the attack
chain focuses on Initial Access, Execution, and Persistence mechanisms. That is: How are
threat actors attempting to compromise hosts and what payloads are they deploying
first? Our corpus of threat actor data includes criminal and state-associated threat
actor groups. Based on our data, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that Cobalt Strike
is becoming increasingly popular among threat actors as an initial access payload, not just a
second-stage tool threat actors use once access is achieved, with criminal threat actors
making up the bulk of attributed Cobalt Strike campaigns in 2020.

Background

3/11

In December 2020, the world learned about an expansive and effective espionage campaign
that successfully backdoored the popular network monitoring software SolarWinds.
Investigators revealed tools used by the threat actors included Cobalt Strike Beacon. This
campaign was attributed to threat actors working for Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service –
a group with Cobalt Strike in their toolbox since at least 2018. This high-profile activity was
part of a clever attack chain enabling advanced threat actors to surreptitiously compromise a
relatively small number of victims. The tool used, and customized to fit their needs, is almost
a decade old but increasingly popular.
Cobalt Strike debuted in 2012 in response to perceived gaps in an existing red team tool, the
Metasploit Framework. In 2015, Cobalt Strike 3.0 launched as a standalone adversary
emulation platform. By 2016, Proofpoint researchers began observing threat actors using
Cobalt Strike.
Historically, Cobalt Strike use in malicious operations was largely associated with wellresourced threat actors, including large cybercrime operators like TA3546 (also known as
FIN7), and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups such as TA423 (also known as
Leviathan or APT40). Proofpoint researchers have attributed two-thirds of identified Cobalt
Strike campaigns from 2016 through 2018 to well-resourced cybercrime organizations or
APT groups. That ratio decreased dramatically the following years – between 2019 and
present, just 15 percent of Cobalt Strike campaigns were attributable to known threat
actors.

Threat actors can obtain Cobalt Strike in a variety of ways: purchasing it directly from
the vendor’s website, which requires verification; buying a version on the dark
web via various hacking forums; or using cracked, illegitimate versions of the software. In
March 2020, a cracked version of Cobalt Strike 4.0 was released and made available to
threat actors.

Cobalt Strike’s Appeal
Cobalt Strike is used by a diverse array of threat actors, and while it is not unusual for
cybercriminal and APT actors to leverage similar tooling in their campaigns, Cobalt Strike is
unique in that its built-in capabilities enable it to be quickly deployed and operationalized
regardless of actor sophistication or access to human or financial resources. The job of
simulating actor attacks and penetrating defenses might become a bit more straightforward
when both sides are using the same tool.
Cobalt Strike is also session-based — that is, if threat actors can access a host and
complete an operation without needing to establish ongoing persistence, there will not be
remaining artifacts on the host after it is no longer running in-memory. In essence: they can
hit it and forget it.
Threat actors can also use the malleability of Cobalt Strike to create customized builds that
add or remove features to achieve objectives or evade detection. For example, APT29
frequently uses custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders to blend in with legitimate traffic
or evade analysis.
For defenders, customized Cobalt Strike modules often require unique signatures, so threat
detection engineers may be required to play catch-up to Cobalt Strike use in the wild. Cobalt
Strike is also appealing to threat actors for its inherent obfuscation. Attribution gets more
difficult if everyone is using the same tool. If an organization has a red team actively making
use of it, it is possible malicious traffic could be mistaken as
legitimate. The software’s ease of use can improve the capabilities of less sophisticated
actors. For sophisticated actors, why spend development cycles on something new when
you already have a great tool for the job?
Proofpoint data shows Cobalt Strike is a popular tool for everything from strategic
compromises to noisy, widespread campaigns. The following examples illustrate a small
sampling of the types of threat actors leveraging Cobalt Strike tracked by Proofpoint.

Threat Actors
TA800

5/11

TA800 is a large crimeware group tracked by Proofpoint since mid-2019. This actor attempts
to deliver and install banking malware or malware loaders, including The Trick
and BazaLoader. In April 2020, TA800 became the first group observed
distributing BazaLoader. In these early campaigns, the threat actor distributed emails with a
malicious link to an executable or a landing page hosted on Google Docs with a link to an
executable. The executable downloaded the BazaLoader backdoor which in turn
downloaded Cobalt Strike. In February 2021, the group pivoted to distributing Cobalt Strike
as a first-stage payload via malicious URLs. There has been some evidence
suggesting TA800’s NimzaLoader is being used to download and execute Cobalt Strike as its
secondary payload.
TA547
TA547 is a crimeware actor tracked by Proofpoint since October 2017. This group appears to
be interested in distributing primarily banking trojans – including The Trick and ZLoader – to
various geographic regions. Since mid-2020, this actor favors using malicious
Microsoft Office attachments to distribute malware. In February 2021, TA547 began
distributing Cobalt Strike as a second-stage payload for command and control.
TA415
TA415 is an APT actor believed to be associated with People’s Republic of
China (PRC) state interests. The group has been noted in United States court filings to be
tied to PRC’s Ministry of State Security. TA415 is also known as Barium and
APT41. Proofpoint identified TA415 delivering Cobalt Strike as a first-stage payload in limited
campaigns during mid-2020. In September 2020, the United States Department of Justice
announced the indictment of several threat actors associated with this threat group,
and detailed the threat actors use of Cobalt Strike in the indictment. Based on
recent reporting by Group-IB, TA415 used Cobalt Strike in a campaign against an entity in
the airlines sector.
The following timeline provides a small sample of threat actor use of Cobalt Strike across
cybercrime and APT threats. The selected events were identified based on their significance,
and are not representative of the full Cobalt Strike threat landscape.

Attack Chain
Proofpoint has observed dozens of threat actors using Cobalt Strike. However, like their
legitimate counterparts, threat actors exhibit many attack paths and use cases of
the malicious actor emulation software. Threat actors use different lure themes, threat types,
droppers, and payloads. For example, the earliest Cobalt Strike campaigns distributed email
threats with malicious document attachments to distribute the malware, but campaigns
distributing malicious URLs directly in the email body have overtaken attachments as the
more frequently utilized threat type.
While instances of Cobalt Strike being sent directly as an initial payload have dramatically
increased, deployment as a second stage payload remains popular. Cobalt Strike has been
observed in a variety of attack chains alongside malware such as The
Trick, BazaLoader, Ursnif, IcedID, and many more popular loaders. In these cases, the
preceding malware typically loads and executes Cobalt Strike. Likewise, there is a wide array
of techniques leveraged in cases where Cobalt Strike is delivered directly, such as via
malicious macros in weaponized Office documents, compressed executables, PowerShell,
dynamic data exchange (DDE), HTA/HTML files, and traffic distribution systems.

8/11

After Cobalt Strike has been executed and a Beacon established for C2 communication,
actors have been observed attempting to enumerate network connections and dumping
Active Directory credentials as they try to move laterally to a network resource such as a
Domain Controller, allowing for deployment of ransomware to all networked systems. For
example, the Cobalt Strike documentation states:
Use the net dclist command to find the Domain Controller for the domain the target is joined
to. Use the net view command to find targets on the domain the target is joined to.
In addition to network discovery and credential dumping, Cobalt Strike Beacon also has the
capability to elevate privileges, load and execute additional tools, and to inject these
functions into existing running host processes to attempt to avoid detection.

Outlook
Proofpoint researchers anticipate Cobalt Strike will continue to be a commonly used tool in
threat actor toolsets. According to internal data, tens of thousands of organizations have
already been targeted with Cobalt Strike, based on observed campaigns. We expect this
number to increase in 2021.

Conclusion
Cobalt Strike is a useful tool, for legitimate security researchers and threat actors alike. Its
malleability coupled with its usability makes it a robust and effective tool for siphoning data,
moving laterally, and loading additional malware payloads.
Cobalt Strike is not the only red team tool appearing more often in Proofpoint data. Others
include Mythic, Meterpreter, and the Veil Framework.
9/11

The use of publicly available tooling aligns with a broader trend observed by Proofpoint:
Threat actors are using as many legitimate tools as possible, including executing Windows
processes like PowerShell and WMI; injecting malicious code into legitimate binaries; and
frequently using allowable services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SendGrid, and Constant
Contact to host and distribute malware.
