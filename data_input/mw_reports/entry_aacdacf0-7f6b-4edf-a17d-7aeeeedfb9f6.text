New infection vector using SFX file and DOWNIISSA downloader
Kaspersky has been tracking activities involving the LODEINFO malware family since 2019,
looking for new modifications and thoroughly investigating any attacks utilizing those new
variants. LODEINFO is sophisticated fileless malware first named in a blogpost from
JPCERT/CC in February 2020. The malware was regularly modified and upgraded by the
developers to target media, diplomatic, governmental and public sector organizations and
think-tanks in Japan.

Japan is likely the main target of LODEINFO
Researchers continued tracking LODEINFO after that. JPCERT/CC and Macnica Networks
shared additional updates on LODEINFO activities in a later publication. Kaspersky
researchers also shared new findings during the HITCON 2021 conference, covering
LODEINFO activities from 2019 to 2020, and revealing high-confidence attribution to APT10.
In March 2022, we observed a Microsoft Word file that was used as the infection vector in
some attacks. In June of the same year, a SFX file was discovered targeting the Japanese
government or related organizations using a decoy file with Japanese content, as well as
utilizing the name of a famous Japanese politician in the filename. A new downloader
shellcode named DOWNIISSA that is used to deploy the LODEINFO backdoor was also
observed.
The first part of this report will provide technical analysis of the new infection methods such
as SFX files and DOWNIISSA along with our findings. The second part will provide technical
analysis of the LODEINFO backdoor and the related shellcode for each version of the
backdoor with the latest LODEINFO IoCs and related information discovered in 2022.
Customers of Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Service have access to additional private APT
reports describing past LODEINFO activities.

Initial infection #1: VBA + DLL sideloading
During our investigation of the attacks in March 2022, we observed a spear-phishing email
with a malicious attachment installing malware persistence modules, which consisted of a
legitimate EXE file and a malicious DLL file loaded via the DLL sideloading technique. For
example, the following section describes a malicious Microsoft Word file (MD5:
da20ff8988198063b56680833c298113) that was uploaded to Virustotal. Once the target
opens the malicious doc file, a message in Japanese is displayed (インターネットセキュリ
ティ設定によると、ファイルを開くために、上の黄色のドキュメントバーの「編集を有効に
する」と「コンテンツの有効化」をクリックしてください。Translation: “According to your
internet security settings, click “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” on the yellow
document bar above to open this file.”) to trick the victims into clicking “Enable Content” and
enabling the embedded macro.

The message in Japanese to trick the target into clicking “Enable Content” and
embedded VBA code
The embedded VBA code creates the folder C:\Users\Public\TMWJPA\ and drops a zip file
named GFIUFR.zip (MD5: 89bd9cf51f8e01bc3b6ec025ed5775fc) in the same folder. The
GFIUFR.zip contains two files named NRTOLF.exe and K7SysMn1.dll. NRTOLF.exe (MD5:
7f7d8c9c1b6735807aefb0841b78f389) is a digitally signed legitimate EXE file from the
K7Security Suite software used for DLL sideloading. K7SysMn1.dll (MD5:
cb2fcd4fd44a7b98af37c6542b198f8d) is a malicious DLL sideloaded by NRTOLF.exe. The
malicious DLL file contains a loader of the LODEINFO shellcode. This DLL is a known loader
module of LODEINFO. It contains a one-byte XOR-encrypted LODEINFO shellcode
internally identified by version 0.5.9. This infection method was also used by the threat actor
in the previous attacks we investigated.

Apart from this, we discovered two more implants related to LODEINFO that were used in
other infection methods in 2022.

Initial infection #2: SFX + DLL sideloading
One of the implants is a self-extracting archive (SFX) file in RAR format (MD5
76cdb7fe189845a0bc243969dba4e7a3) that was also uploaded to Virustotal. Similarly, the
archive contains three files named 1.docx, K7SysMn1.dll and K7SysMon.exe, with the selfextracting script commands shown below. There is also a comment added by the malware
author written in Japanese that can be translated as “The following comment contains a selfextracting script command”:

When a targeted user executes this SFX file, the archive drops other files to %temp% dir and
opens 1.docx as a decoy containing just a few Japanese words such as 申込書
(“Application”), 名前 (“name”) and メールアドレス (“email address”), as shown on the
following screenshot.

4/12

Simple decoy document content from 1.docx
While showing the decoy file to the user, the archive script starts K7SysMon.exe, which
loads the malicious DLL from K7SysMn1.dll (MD5: a8220a76c2fe3f505a7561c3adba5d4a)
via DLL sideloading. The K7SysMn1.dll contains a BLOB with an obfuscated routine not
observed in past activities. The embedded BLOB is divided into four-byte chunks, and each
part is stored in one of the 50 randomly named export functions of the DLL binary. These
export functions reconstruct the BLOB in an allocated buffer and then decode the
LODEINFO shellcode using a one-byte XOR key.

5/12

Reassembling the payload BLOB from parts
The payload that is eventually deployed by this implant is the LODEINFO v0.6.3.

Initial infection #3: SFX + DLL sideloading + additional BLOB file
We also discovered another similar SFX file named <masked>[1]sns用動画 拡散のお願
い.exe (Translation: The spreading request for sns movie of <masked>). The attackers
exploited the name of a well-known Japanese politician. The embedded self-extracting script
and files are very similar to the previous sample discussed in the Initial Infection #2 section
of this article. However, this sample contains an additional file named K7SysMon.Exe.db.
Previously observed loader modules had a BLOB with the encrypted shellcode embedded in
the executable file, but in this sample K7SysMn1.dll does not contain the BLOB. Instead, the
loader module reads the K7SysMon.Exe.db file as the encrypted BLOB and decrypts the
shellcode, which is the LODEINFO v0.6.3 backdoor. The title of the SFX file, as well as the
document content, displays a request to spread a video of the famous politician for SNS
6/12

(Social Network Service). We believe this SFX file was spread via a spear-phishing email on
June 29, 2022, based on the last archiving timestamp. The file name and the decoy
document suggest the target was the Japanese ruling party or a related organization.
On July 4, 2022, another SFX file (MD5 edc27b958c36b3af5ebc3f775ce0bcc7) was
discovered. The archived files, the payload and also the C2 address were very similar to the
previous sample set. The only notable difference was the Japanese title of the decoy
document: “取材のお願い” (“Request for coverage”). We think this SFX file was probably
used to target Japanese media companies.

Initial infection #4: VBA + undiscovered downloader shellcode
DOWNIISSA
Back in August 2020, we discovered a fileless downloader shellcode dubbed DOWNJPIT, a
variant of the LODEINFO malware, and gave a presentation on it at HITCON 2021. In June
2022, we found another fileless downloader shellcode delivered by a password-protected
Microsoft Word file. The filename is 日米同盟の抑止力及び対処力の強化.doc (“Enhancing the
deterrence and coping power of the Japan-US alliance.doc”). The document file contains
malicious macro code that is completely different from previously investigated samples. Once
opened, the doc file shows a Japanese message to enable the following VBA code.

7/12

Malicious VBA code inside MS Word file found in June 2022
Unlike past samples, such as the one described in the Initial Infection #1 section of this
article, where the malicious VBA macro was used to drop different components of the DLL
sideloading technique, in this case the malicious macro code injects and loads an embedded
shellcode in the memory of the WINWORD.exe process directly. This implant was not
present in past activities and the shellcode is also a newly discovered multi-stage
downloader shellcode for LODEINFO v0.6.5.
This downloader shellcode was completely different from the DOWNJPIT variant. The new
downloader shellcode has two URLs inside:
http://172.104.112[.]218/11554.htm
http://www.dvdsesso[.]com/11554.htm
We named this new downloader DOWNIISSA, where IISSA is a string derived from 11554 in
the file names found in the URLs. The following diagram shows the complicated infection
flow from the malicious document file to the final payload downloaded by DOWNIISSA.

8/12

LODEINFO infection process via DOWNIISSA
As mentioned earlier, the embedded macro generates the DOWNIISSA shellcode and injects
it in the current process (WINWORD.exe). The main downloader code is base64-encoded
and placed at the beginning of the DOWNIISSA shellcode, which gets decoded and patched
by the shellcode itself.

DOWNIISSA base64 decode and self-patch
After it has been decoded, some important strings are found with a one-byte XOR
encryption. For example, the two C2 destination addresses are decrypted in the following
code.

9/12

XORed C2 destinations embedded in the main function of DOWNIISSA shellcode
DOWNIISSA uses the URLDownloadToFileA() API function to download the BLOB from the
URL addresses and drop it as %TEMP%/${temp}.tmp. Then it reads the file into allocated
memory in the current process and deletes the downloaded temp file immediately. We
confirmed that both URLs served the same binary data that was XORed with the one-byte
XOR key stored at the end of the BLOB itself. After XOR decryption, the LODEINFO
backdoor shellcode v0.6.5 was found. For the final stage of the infection, DOWNIISSA
creates an instance of msiexec.exe and injects the LODEINFO backdoor shellcode in the
memory of the process.
This new infection flow involving the DOWNIISSA shellcode has not been seen in previous
activities using LODEINFO and is a new TTP in 2022.
Apart from the 11554.htm file found in this sample, we also discovered files with other names
such as 3390.htm, 5246.htm and 16412.htm, hosted on the same C2 servers in July 2022.
3390.htm (MD5: 0fcf90fe2f5165286814ab858d6d4f2a) and 11554.htm (MD5:
f7de43a56bbb271f045851b77656d6bd) were one-byte XORed LODEINFO v0.6.5 shellcodes
downloaded via DOWNIISSA malware. The XOR key for each sample was found at the end
of the file. The 5246.htm (MD5: 6780d9241ad4d8de6e78d936fbf5a922) and 16412.htm
(MD5: 15b80c5e86b8fd08440fe1a9ca9706c9) files are one-byte XORed unique data
structures. The data structure found in the 5246.htm file is shown below:

A byte XORed BLOB is read by the
loading module to infect LODEINFO
v0.6.5. The key is at the end of the
data

This data structure contains the names of three files: K7SysMon.exe, K7SysMn1.dll (MD5:
c5bdf14982543b71fb419df3b43fbf07) and K7SysMon.exe.db (MD5:
c9d724c2c5ae9653045396deaf7e3417). This suggests that an undiscovered downloader
module downloads 5246.htm from the C2 to assist with the installation of some embedded
files on the victim’s machine.

Conclusions
11/12

LODEINFO was first discovered in 2019. LODEINFO and its infection methods have been
constantly updated and improved to become a more sophisticated cyber-espionage tool
while targeting organizations in Japan. The LODEINFO implants and loader modules were
also continuously updated to evade security products and complicate manual analysis by
security researchers.
These modifications may serve as a confirmation that the threat actors track publications by
security researchers and learn how to update their TTPs and improve their malware. In fact,
we haven’t detected any activities involving the LILIMRAT and the DOWNJPIT malware from
this threat actor since publishing our investigation results at HITCON 2021. We believe this
cat-and-mouse game will continue in the future.
To be continued in Part II…
