Summary
The Hornetsecurity Security Lab observed a 1000 % increase in downloads of the Emotet
loader. The increase in Emotet loader downloads is linked to a change in Emotet’s packer,
which causes the loader to be less frequently detected by AV software. The data we have
gathered suggests that the increase in Emotet loader downloads stems from the fact that it’s
less frequently being detected. This makes security mechanisms to less likely to block its
download URLs. Our data, however, also suggests that AV vendors are already closing the
gap in detection, so the detection rates for the Emotet loader should increase, and the
amount of downloads should decrease again. This analysis shows the impact of the changes
made to the packer of the Emotet loader.

Background
The malware now commonly known as Emotet was first observed in 2014. Back then, it was
a banking trojan stealing banking details and login credentials from its victims. Later,
however, it pivoted to a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation providing malware
distribution services to other cybercriminals.

We have already reported on Emotet multiple times in previous blogposts. The following
timeline shows its recent developments:

On 2020-08-18, changes to Emotet’s loader were observed. The Emotet loader is now
packed with a different packer. Various researchers have observed that this packer change
has led to a lower detection rate of the Emotet loader by AV software1. The unpacked loader
has also received updates previously, but these have not caused any considerable impact on
Emotet loader downloads. The changes performed on 2020-08-07 in order to fix a buffer
overflow problem exploited by an Emotet “vaccine” called EmoCrash had no impact on the
presented Emotet loader download statistics, since the “vaccine” only comes into effect after
the Emotet loader has been downloaded.

Technical Analysis
We gathered download statistics from the Emotet download URLs by the methods outlined in
our previous article about Emotet webshells2. For those that have not read our previous
article, the PHP code Emotet uses to facilitate its downloads returns a JSON output stating
the number of downloads of the Emotet payloads on that particular domain. We did not
change our acquisition or analysis methods from the previous article to ensure our results
are directly comparable and any observed changes are caused by the distribution operation
of Emotet and not a collection of analysis artifacts caused by methodological changes.
There are two types of Emotet download URLs: those pointing to an Emotet maldoc and
those pointing to the Emotet loader. The Emotet maldocs, which can be sent by email,
contain download URLs. A VBA macro code uses them to download the Emotet loader, the
actual Emotet malware that installs itself on the victim’s computer.

In our previous analysis, the share of download URLs pointing to the Emotet loader was of
15 %. Now, on 2020-08-19, its share is of 20 %. This is due to the fact that Emotet maldocs
now use 6 or sometimes even 7 Emoter loader download URLs instead of the “classic” 5, as
can be seen from this decoded PowerShell command issued by a recently released Emotet
maldoc:

However, the number of downloads of the Emotet loader we have gathered from hidden
statistic pages on compromised websites has increased more than 5 %.
The Emotet download statistics from 2020-07-29 indicated that the Emotet loader was
downloaded at a rate of around 2500 times per hour in average. The following plot shows the
ratio between loader and maldoc downloads as well as their volume for 2020-07-29:

Two days after the packer change, on 2020-08-19, the Emotet download statistics indicate
that the Emotet loader was downloaded at a rate of around 25000 times per hour on
average, a 1000 % increase. The following plot shows the ratio between Emotet loader and
Emotet maldoc downloads as well as their volume for 2020-08-19:

We attribute this increase to the recent changes to the Emotet packer. The new packer is not
detected very well by AV vendors yet. So, most of the new download URLs after the Emotet
packer change were not detected by any vendors listed on VirusTotal:

5/7

While VirusTotal results do not represent the true dynamic detection of AV software of
Emotet, the lower detection rates, especially when analyzing the download URLs for the
Emotet loader, clearly suggest that the updates to the Emotet packer has indeed decreased
the detection likelihood. Since many of the Emotet loader download URLs used to be flagged
as malicious immediately, many security products were likely to block downloads by potential
victims, thus leading to very few downloads of the Emotet loader overall.
On 2020-08-20, the Emotet loader downloads dropped to 7500 per hour, which constitutes a
decrease of 70 % compared to 2020-08-19:

This is likely because AV vendors are now starting to improve the detection of the new
Emotet packer. At least, VirusTotal detections of new Emotet loader download URLs have
started to be flagged again by AV vendors:

6/7

This further supports our hypothesis that the increase in Emotet loader downloads was
caused by the new packer and, to a lesser extent, by the increase of Emotet loader
download URLs inside the Emotet maldocs.

Conclusion and Countermeasure
Our analysis has shown the impact caused by the changes to the Emotet packer. We
observed a 1000 % increase in Emotet loader downloads which was closely related to the
detections of the Emotet loader download URLs by AV vendors.
To protect against Emotet the US CERT recommends to “implement filters at the email
gateway to filter out emails with known malspam indicators”3.
Hornetsecurity Spam Filter and Malware Protection, with the highest detection rates on the
market, is not impacted by the updates to the Emotet packer (as the packer is never sent
directly via emails) and will thus continue to block all Emotet malspam indicators, such as
macro documents used for infection as well as known Emotet download URLs.
Hornetsecurity’s Advanced Threat Protection extends this protection by also detecting still
unknown malicious links by dynamically downloading and executing the potentially malicious
content in a monitored and sandboxed environment. Thus, even in the event the Emotet
loader changes is accompanied by a change in delivery tactics, Hornetsecurity will be
prepared.
In addition to blocking the incoming Emotet emails, defenders should use the publicly
available information by the Cryptolaemus team, a voluntary group of IT security people
banding together to fight Emotet. They provide new information daily on their website4. There
you can obtain the latest C2 IP list for finding and/or blocking C2 traffic. For real-time
updates, you can follow their Twitter account5.
