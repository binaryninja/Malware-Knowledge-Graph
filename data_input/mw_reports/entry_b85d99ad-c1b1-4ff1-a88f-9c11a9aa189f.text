Unraveling Network Infrastructure Linked to the
SolarWinds Hack
domaintools.com/resources/blog/unraveling-network-infrastructure-linked-to-the-solarwinds-hack

Background
On 13 December 2020, multiple media reports emerged first identifying network intrusions
at several US government agencies. Subsequent reporting indicated these intrusions, along
with a previously-identified breach at information security giant FireEye, were linked to a
compromise at IT management and remote monitoring software provider SolarWinds.
FireEye and Microsoft followed up media reporting with in-depth technical reports on a
complex supply chain attack focusing on SolarWinds’ Orion IT monitoring software. The
attack focuses on a malicious Dynamic Linked Library (DLL) included in the legitimate Orion
installer package, referred to as SUNBURST or Solorigate by FireEye and Microsoft,
respectively. Network defenders, threat researchers, and other interested parties are
strongly encouraged to review the linked reports from FireEye and Microsoft to understand
these campaigns in detail.
However, as part of the overall intrusion via the compromise at SolarWinds, several
interesting network-based observations emerge. This includes both behaviors related to the
Command and Control (C2) activity of SUNBURST and the characteristics of the network
infrastructure used to facilitate the campaign.

Observed Command and Control Behavior
SUNBURST uses a complex, multi-staged mechanism for identifying a controlling C2
server, and performing subsequent communication. This is summarized in the following
chart.

C2 behavior is first dependent on resolving a subdomain of the first-stage C2 domain:
Avsvmcloud[.]com

The primary domain is interesting, as it first appears long before the Spring 2020 timeframe
when SUNBURST is believed to have started (Spring 2020), in July 2018. A closer view of
Whois history via DomainTools Iris shows a noticeable change in the domain in late 2019:

Initially, the domain was registered via Namecheap with PrivacyGuardian anonymization,
but then shifted to completely different services (GoDaddy and Domains by Proxy) in
December 2019. This change in registration information is reflected in hosting and related
characteristics:

The two images above capture alterations in hosting and authoritative name server:
The domain shifted to GoDaddy parking infrastructure on 20 December 2019, roughly
the same time as the change in registration.
The domain remains on GoDaddy parking infrastructure until 27 February 2020, when
it shifts to Microsoft cloud hosting (52.171.135[.]15, then 13.65.251[.]83)
At the same time hosting shifts to Microsoft, the domain changes authoritative name
server to self-hosting at Avsvmcloud[.]com.

The primary domain ceases to resolve to an IP address on 30 October 2020.
While the primary domain ceases to resolve on 30 October 2020, subdomains remained
active through early December 2020 as shown in DomainTools Passive DNS (pDNS) data:

3/8

With the above, we have some initial observations related to this campaign:
1. Primary C2 infrastructure was acquired and initially provisioned in December 2019
using an existing but likely expired domain that superficially resembles a domain for
cloud hosting services.
2. Hosting, name server, and other items necessary for operational use were established
on 27 February 2020.
3. If Avsvmcloud[.]com is the only primary C2 domain, the SUNBURST campaign was
operational no earlier than 27 February 2020, with a significant change in aspect on
30 October 2020.
Yet, operations do not end here. Provided the subdomain of Avsvmcloud[.]com resolves to
a value not in an internally-stored blocklist of IP address ranges, C2 behavior looks for a
returned Canonical Name (CNAME) record. This value is used for subsequent C2 activity,
sent via HTTP but using the Orion Improvement Program format to “blend in” to network
communications. Observed domains linked to second-stage C2 include the following items:

Understanding Network Infrastructure
Based on the dataset of eleven domains—one initial C2 item that works to resolve a second
C2 domain for adversary use—we can derive several lessons about the responsible
adversary and their infrastructure tendencies.
First and foremost, the adversary relies overwhelmingly on cloud-based providers such as
Amazon and Microsoft for hosting purposes, with smaller or less-reputable providers also
used for the second-stage C2 domains. While not well reflected in the pattern of secondstage domains, pDNS information for subdomain resolutions on Avsvmcloud[.]com show an
overwhelming use of major cloud providers in returned responses, captured in DomainTools
Iris output here. This hosting tendency makes infrastructure pivoting difficult, but also
presents problems for defenders as such infrastructure can be shared by additional, nonmalicious entities or reallocated quickly to other parties which muddies forensic analysis.
Second, naming themes as one component of domain characteristics show a tendency
toward technology or IT service names. Although somewhat difficult to track and filter,
identifying naming themes in new, previously unobserved network traffic can serve as a way
to flag suspicious infrastructure for follow-on investigation. Looking for “technology
adjacent” domains newly resolving can serve as a tripwire for possible malicious activity.

Third, the domains in question appear to represent a combination of likely adversary
created (such as Databasegalore[.]com, which was created roughly the same time
Avsvmcloud[.]com was provisioned), opportunistic re-registration of existing domains, and
possible compromise of legitimate infrastructure. In the second case, Deftsecurity[.]com
changes registrar and privacy provider in February 2019 despite existing for several years
prior indicating likely re-registration by the adversary. More concerning are cases such as
Freescanonline[.]com, which appears to have been a legitimate site for Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) analysis as late as August 2019:

Of note, this domain was resolving to 108.179.242[.]236 until mid-February 2020, when it
shifted to Amazon hosting inline with other network items observed in this campaign. This
item therefore is somewhat ambiguous, either representing adversary take-over (given how
recently it appears to have been used for legitimate purposes) or opportunistic reregistration on expiration.
Overall, the attacker leveraged domains with some degree of “history” behind them to
evade filters or algorithms that flag network infrastructure due to “newness”. By having
several months of creation time before either taking control over or modifying hosting for
use in the SUNBURST campaign between December 2019 and March 2020 (based on
analysis of DomainTools data), the attacker could build a false sense of trust in the network
infrastructure used to potentially evade some security solutions and analysis.

Lessons for Defenders
Overall, the SUNBURST campaign represents a highly complex, operationally savvy, and
technically patient campaign. As detailed by FireEye and Microsoft, this extends to
subsequent lateral movement operations within victim networks, which relied
6/8

overwhelmingly on capturing credentials within victim environments and mimicking user
activity to evade detection. We as network defenders are thus presented with an
exceptionally difficult attack to detect, defeat, and recover from—or are we?
As documented in this posting, there are a number of network observables that are critical
to attacker success for C2 purposes as part of SUNBURST operations. While certainly not
without its own difficulties, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and DNS analysis can
identify new, unusual, or outright suspicious network communication patterns.
Monitoring is even more powerful when tracking external communications is combined with
internal system awareness to quickly disposition what hosts are communicating to outside
entities. In the case of the SolarWinds Orion software, identifying traffic from this service or
its hosting device to new, unusual domains—even if using communication patterns similar
to Orion telemetry—can rapidly identify connections that are abnormal and worth further
scrutiny.
While much work would remain to properly disposition the event in question and discover
something as complex and evasive as a malicious, signed update package, at least initial
detection that something is “wrong” can be readily achieved. Next steps would require
further analysis, review of system behaviors and configurations, and subsequent
investigation—but at a minimum defenders are now alert and aware that something is
amiss within the monitored environment.

Conclusion
The SUNBURST campaign represents a uniquely distressing intrusion event with
implications for multiple industries and network operators. The ubiquity of SolarWinds in
large networks, combined with the potentially long dwell time of intrusions facilitated by this
compromise, mean victims of this campaign need not only recover their SolarWinds
instance, but may need to perform widespread password resets, device recovery, and
similar restoration activity to completely evict an intruder.
While this is concerning and unfortunate for the present circumstances, future supply chain
attacks—as this will not be the last such incident to impact network defenders and
operators—can be met with and detected by aggressive NSM and communication visibility.
So long as even the most complex backdoor or implant requires communication to or
instructions from a controlling entity, defenders have opportunities to detect and disrupt
operations. Through continuous monitoring of network traffic and an understanding of what
hosts are communicating, defenders can leverage attacker weaknesses and dependencies
to overcome these otherwise daunting challenges.
