As the war in Ukraine intensifies, researchers at Bitdefender Labs are picking up waves of
fraudulent and malicious emails exploiting the humanitarian crisis and charitable spirit of
recipients across the globe. What we’ve seen so far:

Malspam campaigns deliver Agent Tesla and Remcos RATs
Since March 1, Bitdefender Labs have been tracking two phishing campaigns attempting to
infect recipients with two well-known remote access Trojans – Agent Tesla and Remcos.
Campaign 1:
The first malspam campaign appears to be targeting organizations in the manufacturing
industry via a .zip attachment ‘REQ Supplier Survey’. The attackers ask recipients to fill out
a survey concerning their backup plans in response to the war in Ukraine.
According to our threat researchers, the malicious payload is downloaded and deployed
from a Discord link directly on the victim’s machine. Interestingly though, interacting with the
malicious file will also download a clean version of Chrome on the users’ device – most
likely an attempt at diverting users.

Agent Tesla is an infamous Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) RAT and data stealer that has
been prevalent in numerous email-based cyberattacks during the health crisis. Perpetrators
use Agent Tesla to exfiltrate sensitive information including credentials, keystrokes and
clipboard data from their targets.
According to our analysis, the attacks seemingly originated from IP addresses in the
Netherlands (86%) and Hungary (3%). The malicious emails have reached recipients
worldwide including South Korea (23%), Germany (10%), the UK (10%), the US (8%), the
Czech Republic (14%), Ireland (5%), Hungary (3%), Sweden (3%) and Australia (2%).
Bitdefender customers are already protected against Agent Tesla attacks. The attached file
REQ Supplier Survey.zip, detected as Gen:NN.ZemsilCO.34232.cm0@aKLKBXo, is
detected and blocked by both our consumer and enterprise solutions.
Campaign 2:

Our researchers spotted a separate malspam campaign on March 2, where attackers
impersonate a South Korean-based healthcare company that specializes in in-vitro
diagnostics analyzers to deliver the Remcos RAT via an Excel attachment
(SUCT220002.xlsx).
The message cites the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and asks recipients if they want to put
one of their orders on hold until shipments and flights reopen. Cyber attackers mainly
deploy Remcos RAT via malicious documents or archives to gain full control over their
victims’ systems. Once inside, they can capture keystrokes, screenshots, credentials, or
other sensitive system information and exfiltrate it directly to their servers.

Eighty-nine percent of the malicious emails appear to originate from IP addresses in
Germany and 19% from the US. The attackers’ focus in on recipients in Ireland (32%), India
(17%), the US (7%), the UK (4%), Germany (4%), Vietnam (4%), Russia (2%), South Africa
(2%) and Australia (2%).

“Although the recent cyberattacks were not specifically aimed at Ukrainian infrastructure or
civilian population, the global tension generated by the ongoing war will likely materialize in
more targeted attacks that could deter emergency response services and humanitarian aid
efforts in the country," said Alexandru Maximciuc, threat researcher at Bitdefender Labs.
"We've already seen mass DDoS attacks and wiper malware that hit financial institutions
and organizations in Ukraine. Considering the extended economic sanctions imposed by
western nations in response to the Russian invasion, digital aggressions aimed at disrupting
critical infrastructures should not be dismissed in the current threat landscape.”
Bitdefender consumer and business solutions detect the malicious attachment

Charity crypto scams are intensifying
On Feb 25, Bitdefender Antispam Lab reported the first signs of scammers exploiting the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and news of Ukrainian citizens fleeing the country. As
expected, fraudsters continue to leverage the ongoing humanitarian crisis for their own
financial gains.
Within hours after the invasion, the Ukrainian government announced it accepts BTC and
ETH cryptocurrency donations, and the global community did not disappoint. According to
the latest analysis of blockchain transactions, the ETH wallet received over 18,524
transactions totaling over $9.7 million, while the BTC wallet shows more than 9,300
transactions with a value of $9.4 million.
There’s no doubt about it; individuals, organizations, and governments are picking sides,
and cybercriminals have to intensify their efforts to redirect any financial aid into their
pockets.
“Major global events and crises are known to trigger malicious spam campaigns that exploit
human emotion and people's desire to help,” said Adrian Miron, Antispam Research
Manager at Bitdefender.

“So far, we've noticed that the attackers reacted very quickly to legitimate announcements
of Ukraine and other organizations by mimicking the format of their messages. We expect
the variety of phishing and malware campaigns, as well as the volume of messages sent
daily, to increase steadily, and the attackers to adapt their persuasion methods accordingly.”
Bitdefender Labs is actively monitoring fraudulent donation emails luring recipients to
donate money. Scammers are impersonating the Ukrainian government, international
humanitarian agency Act for Peace, UNICEF, and other donation projects such as the
Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund to deliver their pleas for financial assistance to help the
Ukrainian army and millions of civilians and children caught in the military conflict.

Subject lines are as follows:
Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin,
Ethereum and USDT.
HELP UKRAINE stop the war!
Ukraine Humanitarian Donation
Donate to Ukraine, Help save a life: Please read
Urgent! Help Children in Ukraine
Subject: Help Ukraine
The emails play on users’ emotions citing the impact on communities in Ukraine and the
growing number of refugees that are fleeing the country and in great need of supplies and
housing.
Email-based charity scams peaked on March 2, according to Bitdefender Antispam Lab.
One particular campaign, using the subject line “Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now
accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT” originating from IP
addresses in China has reached tens of thousands of inboxes on March 2nd. Twenty-five
percent of the scam emails were directed to users in the UK, 14% in the US, 10% in South
Korea, 8% in Japan, 7% in Germany, 4% in Romania, and 2% each in Greece, Finland and
Italy.

Nigerian Prince-style email schemes
Bitdefender spam filters have also noticed a Ukraine variation of the Nigerian Prince scam.
The email, allegedly sent by a renowned businessman from Ukraine seeks your assistance
to transfer $10 million until he is able to relocate somewhere safe.
Fraudsters behind this particular scam are sending emails from IP addresses in Botswana
(83%), Germany (10%) and France 5%. Their main audience are users in Germany (42%),
Turkey (16%), the US (16%), Ireland (8%) and Poland (3%).
Unfortunately, users who respond to this email will get in touch with the scammer who will
ask for personal information to help transfer the money out of the country. Although the
email does not promise recipients any financial awards for their help, the con artist will likely
specify remuneration for helping him finalize the transfer. Most often the scammer will ask

recipients to pay administration fees, often associated with moving large sums. Upon
deceiving the victim, the scammer will either disappear with the money or, worse, drain their
bank account in the process.

Sample 7
Bitdefender’s focus on cybersafety
The fact that cybercriminals and scammers are using the crisis in Ukraine to steal users’
money and spread malicious payloads comes as no surprise to cybersecurity experts.
Although the war in Ukraine may be thousands of miles away from many of us, people’s
suffering triggers a strong emotional response to users worldwide who wish to lend a hand
to refugees fleeing the war-struck European country.
We urge all internet users to be extra vigilant during these troubled times and practice good
cyber hygiene to ensure that their hard-earned money does not end up in the wrong hands:
Never click on links or attachments in emails or messages that ask you to donate
urgently
Donate exclusively via official and trusted charities, non-profit organizations and
fundraisers
Check your financial accounts regularly for any suspicious activity or unauthorized
charges
Set up unique passwords for all online accounts
For more tips, please check our dedicated cybersecurity guide in armed conflict
zones.
In response to the military crisis and increased cybercriminal activity, Bitdefender & the
Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) are offering free cybersecurity
protection for any Ukrainian citizen, company or institution, as long as necessary.
