The evolution of Pangolin8RAT - Case3 (Ketugya)
The workflow of Ketugya
• Same decryption method with Case 2
• Step1: Read payload from resource ID:1905
• Step2: Uses Tiny-AES algorithm to decrypt the payload
• Step3: Unzip the decrypted payload -> shellcode
• Step4: shellcode will use Tiny-AES algorithm to decrypt payload again -> in-memory dll (first stage
DLL)
• Step5: run first-stage DLL in memory via reflective DLL injection techniques
• Step6: go-to Step1 until the final-stage DLL/payload is running in-memory

31

The evolution of Pangolin8RAT - Case3 (Ketugya)
TTPs used by Ketugya
• Kill EDR process*

• Modify the token Integrity of the PPL (Protected Process Light) process to Untrusted
• Kill Windows defender process (MsMpEng.exe)

• Anti IDA Pro decompiler

• Junk code will cause decompilation failure (stack frame is too big)

• Modular-featured RATs become more popular
• Highly possible to be shared or even sold among
Chinese threat groups
• Both espionage and financially driven operations

61

Conclusion and Outlook
New mode of APT operations
•
•
•

Trends of malware sharing
Malware with similar structure and techniques
Malware-as-a-Service among APT groups

Tianwu might operate as:
a collaborator of APT41, a subgroup of APT41, or
a digital quartermaster of Chinese APTs

62

Countermeasures
Defend your organization with all-level Intelligence
•

Tactical
- Feed CTI vendor’s IoCs to cybersecurity infra

•

Operational
- Patch servers in timely manner
- Beware of new social engineering tactics
- Apply in-memory detection
Strategic
- New operation mode of Chinese APTs makes
attribution/group tracking more difficult
- China’s policies/crackdown heavily affects cyberspace
in APAC region
