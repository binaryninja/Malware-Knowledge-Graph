HackingTeam was a Milan-based information technology company that sold offensive intrusion
and surveillance capabilities to governments, law enforcement agencies and corporations.[1] Its
"Remote Control Systems" enable governments and corporations to monitor the
communications of internet users, decipher their encrypted files and emails, record Skype and
other Voice over IP communications, and remotely activate microphones and camera on target
computers.[2] The company has been criticized for providing these capabilities to governments
with poor human rights records,[3] though HackingTeam states that they have the ability to
disable their software if it is used unethically.[4][5] The Italian government has restricted their
licence to do business with countries outside Europe.[6]
HackingTeam employs around 40 people in its Italian office, and has subsidiary branches in
Annapolis, Washington, D.C., and Singapore.[7] Its products are in use in dozens of countries
across six continents.[8]

Company foundation
HackingTeam was founded in 2003 by Italian entrepreneurs Vincenzetti and Valeriano
Bedeschi. In 2007 the company was invested by two Italian VC: Fondo Next and Innogest.[9]
The Milan police department learned of the company. Hoping to use its tool to spy on Italian
citizens and listen to their Skype calls, the police contacted Vincenzetti and asked him to help.
[10] HackingTeam became "the first sellers of commercial hacking software to the police”.

According to former employee Byamukama Robinhood, the company began as security
services provider, offering penetration testing, auditing and other defensive capabilities to
clients.[11] Byamukama states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed
and accounted for a larger percentage of revenues, the organization pivoted in a more
offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Byamukama claims fellow
employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and
payloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife
within the organization.[11]
In February 2014, a report from Citizen Lab identified the organisation to be using hosting
services from Linode, Telecom Italia, Rackspace, NOC4Hosts and bullet proof hosting
company Santrex.[12]
On 5 July 2015 the company suffered a major data breach of customer data, software code,
internal documents and e-mails. (See: § 2015 data breach)
On 2 April 2019 HackingTeam was acquired by InTheCyber Group to create Memento Labs [13]

Products and capabilities
Hacking Team enables clients to perform remote monitoring functions against citizens via their
RCS (remote control systems), including their Da Vinci and Galileo platforms:[1]
Covert collection of emails, text message, phone call history and address books
Keystroke logging
Uncover search history data and take screenshots
Record audio from phone calls
Capture audio and video stream from device memory to bypass cryptography of Skype
sessions[14]
Use microphones on device to collect ambient background noise and conversations
Activate phone or computer cameras
Hijack telephone GPS systems to monitor target's location
Infect target computer's UEFI BIOS firmware with a rootkit[15]
Extract WiFi passwords[16]
Exfiltrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency wallet files to collect data on local accounts,
contacts and transaction histories[17]
HackingTeam uses advanced techniques to avoid draining cell phone batteries, which could
potentially raise suspicions, and other methods to avoid detection.[18][19]
The malware has payloads for Android,[16] BlackBerry, Apple iOS, Linux, Mac OS X, Symbian,
as well as Microsoft Windows, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone class of operating
systems.[20]

RCS is a management platform that allows operators to remotely deploy exploits and payloads
against targeted systems, remotely manage devices once compromised, and exfiltrate data for
remote analysis.

Controversies
Use by repressive governments
HackingTeam has been criticized for selling its products and services to governments with poor
human rights records, including Sudan, Bahrain, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.[21]
In June 2014, a United Nations panel monitoring the implementation of sanctions on Sudan
requested information from HackingTeam about their alleged sales of software to the country in
contravention of United Nations weapons export bans to Sudan. Documents leaked in the 2015
data breach of HackingTeam revealed the organization sold Sudanese National Intelligence
and Security Service access to their "Remote Control System" software in 2012 for 960,000
Euros.[21]
In response to the United Nations panel, the company responded in January 2015 that they
were not currently selling to Sudan. In a follow-up exchange, HackingTeam asserted that their
product was not controlled as a weapon, and so the request was beyond the scope of the
panel. There was no need for them to disclose previous sales, which they considered
confidential business information.[21]
The U.N. disagreed. "The view of the panel is that as such software is ideally suited to support
military electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations it may potentially fall under the category of
'military ... equipment' or 'assistance' related to prohibited items," the secretary wrote in March.
"Thus its potential use in targeting any of the belligerents in the Darfur conflict is of interest to
the Panel."[21][22]
In the fall of 2014, the Italian government abruptly froze all of HackingTeam's exports, citing
human rights concerns. After lobbying Italian officials, the company temporarily won back the
right to sell its products abroad.[21]

2015 data breach
On July 5, 2015, the Twitter account of the company was compromised by an unknown
individual who published an announcement of a data breach against HackingTeam's computer
systems. The initial message read, "Since we have nothing to hide, we're publishing all our emails, files, and source code ..." and provided links to over 400 gigabytes of data, including
alleged internal e-mails, invoices, and source code; which were leaked via BitTorrent and
Mega.[23] An announcement of the data breach, including a link to the bittorrent seed, was
retweeted by WikiLeaks and by many others through social media.[24][25]

3/17

The material was voluminous and early analysis appeared to reveal that HackingTeam had
invoiced the Lebanese Army[26] and Sudan and that spy tools were also sold to Bahrain and
Kazakhstan.[25] HackingTeam had previously claimed they had never done business with
Sudan.[27]
The leaked data revealed a zero-day cross-platform Flash exploit (CVE number: CVE-20155119.[28] The dump included a demo of this exploit by opening Calculator from a test webpage.
[29][30][31] Adobe patched the hole on July 8, 2015.[32] Another vulnerability involving Adobe was
revealed in the dumps, which took advantage of a buffer overflow attack on an Adobe Open
Type Manager DLL included with Microsoft Windows. The DLL is run in kernel mode, so the
attack could perform privilege escalation to bypass the sandbox.[33]
Also revealed in leaked data was HackingTeam employees' use of weak passwords, including
'P4ssword', 'wolverine', and 'universo'.[34]
After a few hours without response from HackingTeam, member Christian Pozzi tweeted the
company was working closely with police and "what the attackers are claiming regarding our
company is not true."[35][36] He also claimed the leaked archive "contains a virus" and that it
constituted "false info".[37] Shortly after these tweets, Pozzi's Twitter account itself was
apparently compromised.[38]
Responsibility for this attack was claimed by the hacker known as "Phineas Fisher" (or Phisher)
on Twitter.[39] Phineas has previously attacked spyware firm Gamma International, who
produce malware, such as FinFisher, for governments and corporations.[40] In 2016, Phineas
published details of the attack, in Spanish and English, as a "how-to" for others, and explained
the motivations behind the attack.[41]
The internal documents revealed details of HackingTeam's contracts with repressive
governments.[42] In 2016, the Italian government again revoked the company's license to sell
spyware outside of Europe without special permission.[6][43]

Use by Mexican drug cartels
Corrupt Mexican officials have helped drug cartels obtain state-of-the-art spyware (including
Hacking Team spyware). The software has been used to target and intimidate Mexican
journalists by drug cartels and cartel-entwined government actors.[44]

Customer list
HackingTeam's clientele include not just governments, but also corporate clients such as
Barclays and British Telecom (BT) of the United Kingdom, as well as Deutsche Bank of
Germany.[1]
A full list of HackingTeam's customers were leaked in the 2015 breach. Disclosed documents
show HackingTeam had 70 current customers, mostly military, police, federal and provincial
governments.
The total company revenues disclosed exceeded 40 million Euros.[45][46][47][48][49]
[50]
4/17

On Sep 8, 2021,SentinelLABS released a research report about a Turkish threat actor
EGoManiac,that used Remote Control System (RCS), software from the Italian infosec firm
Hacking Team,which was operated between 2010 and 2016 and campaign run by Turkish TV
journalists at OdaTV for spying Turkish police.[51]
