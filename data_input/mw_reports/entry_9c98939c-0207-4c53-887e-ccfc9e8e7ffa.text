Vipasana ransomware new ransom on the block
bartblaze.blogspot.com/2016/02/vipasana-ransomware-new-ransom-on-block.html

Yet another ransomware is going around (since at least the 20th of December), which I've
dubbed Vipasana ransomware due to where you need to send your encrypted files to:

Message in Russian, you need to mail vipasana4@aol.com to get your files back
The name may be derived from Vipassanā or 'insight meditation'.
1/4

The message in Russian reads:
твои файлы зашифрованы, если хочешь
все вернуть, отправь 1 зашифрованный файл на эту почту:
vipasana4@aol.com
ВНИМАНИЕ!!! у вас есть 1 неделя что-бы написать мне на почту, по прошествии
этого срока расшифровка станет не возможна!!!!

Translated:
Your files are encrypted, if you want them all returned,
send 1 encrypted file to this email:
vipasana4@aol.com
ATTENTION!!! you have 1 week to send the email, after
this deadline decryption will not be possible !!!!

It seems these ransomware authors first want you to send an email before requiring any
other action, rather than immediately (or in a certain timeframe) paying Bitcoins to get your
files back. In this sense, their technique is novel. Instead of the usual 24/48/72h to pay up,
they give you a week.
Do not be fooled: this does not make them 'good guys' in any way, they encrypted your files
and as such are criminals.
Search results for vipasana4@aol.com are non-existent, with the exception of one victim hit
by this ransomware:

Email addresses used in this specific ransomware campaign:
johnmen.24@aol.com
vipasana4@aol.com
Files will be encrypted and renamed following below naming convention:
email-vipasana4@aol.com.ver-CL 1.2.0.0.id-[ID]-[DATE-TIME].randomname-[RANDOM].
[XYZ].CBF
Where [XYZ] is also a random 'extension', the real extension is .cbf
ver-CL 1.2.0.0 may refer to the version number of the ransomware, indicating there are older
versions as well.
Targeted file extensions:

I have sent over all necessary files to the good people over at Bleeping Computer, as there
may be a way to recover files. If so, I will update this post.
Update - 12/02: thanks to a tweet from Catalin this appears to be another version of so
called "offline" ransomware, discovered by Check Point:
“Offline” Ransomware Encrypts Your Data without C&C Communication
Note this is in fact a Cryakl variant.
Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a way to recover your files once encrypted. Your
best best in trying to recover files is using a tool like Shadow Explorer, which will check if you
can restore files using 'shadow copies' or 'shadow volume copies'.
If that doesn't work, you may try using a data recovery program such as PhotoRec or Recuva
Conclusion
Ransomware is, unfortunately, long from gone. Almost each week or month, new variants or
totally new strains of ransomware are popping up. In this way, the first and foremost rule is:
Create (regular) backups!
