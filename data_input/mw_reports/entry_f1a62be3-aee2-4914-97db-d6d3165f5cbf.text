Executive Summary
In July 2014, Palo Alto Networks® Unit 42 released its first threat intelligence report
on Nigerian cyber actors. This report documented the observed evolution from
traditional 419-style email scams to the use of commodity malware for financial gain.
Over the past two years, Palo Alto Networks has continued to collect thousands of
samples of malware associated with these actors. With this wealth of data, Unit 42
recently launched an unprecedented analytic effort to develop a current assessment
of the size, scope and complexity of this threat.
Applying advanced analytics across more than 8,400 samples resulted in the
identification of over 500 domains supporting malware activity and roughly
100 unique actors or groups, which we continue to track under the code name
“SilverTerrier.” This data exhibited that these actors’ ability to distribute malware has
grown steadily over the past two years to its current rate of 5,000–8,000 attacks
per month. Moreover, using email as the primary means of distribution, the majority
of these attacks were focused against the high technology, higher education and
manufacturing industries.
While these attacks originate from actors with varying degrees of technical expertise,
all of the actors continue to rely on commodity malware tools, which require minimal
infrastructure to set up and can be acquired on underground forums at nominal
costs. Historically, this fact has been used to draw assumptions regarding the
technical competence of these actors; however, given our findings, we believe these
assumptions may warrant reassessment.
Through our analysis, it has become clear that Nigerian cyber actors have
demonstrated significant growth in size, scope and capability over the past two
years. They have learned how to successfully apply simple malware tools with
precision in order to create substantial losses ranging from tens of thousands up to
millions of dollars for victim organizations, and they have broadened their scope well
beyond targeting unsuspecting individuals. As a result, these actors now pose
a formidable threat to businesses worldwide.

History
Over the past three decades, the world has witnessed an evolution of fraud stemming
from criminals operating within Nigeria. Starting in the early 1980s, millions of paper
letters were distributed to unsuspecting recipients all over the world. These letters
often followed the template of the historical, advance-fee type of scam in which
recipients were enticed to transfer funds or send their financial information in exchange
for generous returns or compensation. The stories behind these paper letter scams
continued to evolve through the 1980s, and with Laws of the Federation of Nigeria
being passed under military decree in 1990, they soon became known as “419 scams”
based on the section of criminal code that covered fraud.

In the mid-1990s, telecom providers within the country began offering internet
services, and it didn’t take long for 419 scams to make the leap to this new medium.
The availability of email allowed scammers to rapidly tailor their schemes based on
current events, interact in near real-time with potential victims, and ultimately led to a
significant increase in the magnitude of their distribution.
This trend continued to climb and, in 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
released its annual Internet Crime Report listing Nigeria as third in the world for
conducting cybercriminal activity. While the country’s position on the list has
fluctuated over the years, it once again claimed the number three position in
last year’s Internet Crime Report.
Over that same period, tactics and techniques continued to evolve, shifting gradually
from the traditional 419 emails to schemes involving full websites designed to
impersonate legitimate entities. In July 2014, Unit 42 released a report called
419 Evolution documenting that Nigerian cybercriminals had officially incorporated
malware into their schemes.

Tools & Trends
Since 2014, Nigerian actors have been linked to various popular malware tools,
including Zeus, DarkComet and others. All of these tools have something in
common: they are commodity malware tools that require minimal infrastructure to
set up and can be purchased at nominal costs on underground forums. Traditionally,
this fact has been used to justify assessments that suggest these actors lack the
technical aptitude required for more advanced tools. But our research suggests
that these tools may be chosen intentionally to support easy scalability among a
distributed actor network similar to an organized crime model.
As these tools rise and fall in popularity (and more importantly, as detection rates
by antivirus vendors improve), SilverTerrier actors have consistently adopted new
malware families and shifted to the latest packing tools available. Given this trend,
the focus of this report is on the Predator Pain, ISR Stealer, Keybase, ISpySoftware
and Pony malware families, due to their current popularity among Nigerian actors.
These five tools range in cost from free to $35, depending on the version, capabilities
and licensing requirements desired by the actor. Each tool produces malicious
executable files that are designed either to provide remote access to a system
or to steal credentials from a victim, with the majority of these variants targeting
Microsoft® Windows® operating systems.
While the malware itself is not overly complex, these actors routinely rely on packing
software or “crypters” in order to obfuscate the code so that it won’t be identified
by traditional antivirus solutions. In doing so, they are able to maintain a core set
of cheap malware tools and infrastructure while only paying for secondary tools
designed to disguise their malware as benign files. To that end, some actors have
been observed employing the latest crypters they can gain access to, often using a
tool for only a few weeks before upgrading or shifting to the next available tool.

Analyzing their use of the five core malware tools, the ability of SilverTerrier actors to
distribute malware has grown steadily over time to its current level of 5,000–8,000
attacks per month. However, in May 2016, they demonstrated the added ability to
surge distribution efforts by launching nearly 19,000 attacks in one month.

While the malware itself can be distributed at scale and in far greater numbers than
observed above, the benefits of doing so are often diminished for these actors. As
a basic principle, there is generally a correlation between the amount of malware
distributed and the time it takes for antivirus vendors to identify and block it. Thus,
these Nigerian actors have refined their attack methods over time from sending
malware in bulk across the internet to a more focused, deliberate and targeted
approach. Specifically, our data showed that 86 percent of the malware samples
analyzed were observed in 20 or fewer attacks against Palo Alto Networks customers.

Who Are They?
Using AutoFocus™ contextual threat intelligence, combined with advanced analytic
practices, Unit 42 is currently tracking roughly 100 Nigerian cyber actors responsible for
operating the infrastructure associated with the five malware families identified above.
These actors were predominately identified using domain registration details, which, in
many cases, enabled Unit 42 to link these actors directly to their social media profiles.
Performing this practice on a large scale has produced tremendous insights into the size,
scope, motivations and interactions of these actors.

What Do We Know About These Actors?
They are comfortable. The actors we have identified are individuals predominately from
the cities of Owerri, Lagos, Enugu, Warri and Port Harcourt in the southwest/coastal region
of Nigeria. The majority of these actors continue to reside in these cities, close to friends
and family, where they live comfortably on the proceeds of their criminal activity (particularly
given the favorable exchange rate between foreign currency and the Nigerian naira).
Additionally, some of the more successful actors have begun traveling abroad to European
and Asian countries. The two most popular locations appear to be the United Kingdom and
Malaysia where many of these individuals quickly reestablish their criminal operations.
They are educated. Many of them have attended technical secondary schools and have
gone on to obtain undergraduate degrees from the Federal University of Technology
(FUTO) or other regionally aligned university systems offering technical degree programs.
They aren’t kids. These individuals range in age from late teenage years to adults
in their mid-40s, thus representing a wide range of generations participating in this
criminal activity. Historical domain data revealed that the older generations consist of

PA L O A LT O N E T W O R K S

+

S I LV E R T E R R I E R

5

individuals who were once successful at launching 419 email campaigns and
impersonating legitimate government, financial, manufacturing and international
freight organizations to support their schemes. The younger generations represent
those graduating fresh out of the universities, who are beginning their criminal
careers with malware, while building off the scamming techniques developed by the
older generation. Together, these groups are blending their tools and techniques to
achieve their goals. However, while the tools these actors use are relatively simple,
their employment of the tools indicates a clear level of refinement, precision and
sophistication.
They aren’t necessarily hiding. While a small subset of the actors go to great
lengths to conceal their identities, the culture within Nigeria tends to provide
a permissive environment for these types of illicit activities. Scams, fraud and
corruption are viewed as a way of life, and as a result, the majority of these actors
apply little effort toward maintaining anonymity. Instead they frequently combine
fake names, aliases or nicknames with local addresses, phone numbers and
personal email accounts in order to register their malicious domains. In most cases,
these attributes can easily be linked back to their well-developed online social
profiles. These profiles include Google®, Hotmail and Yahoo!® email addresses, as
well as social media accounts on Facebook®, Google+™, YouTube™ and, to a lesser
extent, LinkedIn® and Twitter®. Across their social media accounts, many of these
actors claim to be “self-employed,” while their profiles document their education,
their associates, and openly flaunt their success through pictures of nice cars, gold
chains and foreign currency.
They are becoming organized. Various actors are communicating, cooperating, and
sharing tools and techniques. The individuals who maintain the technical aptitude to
establish malware infrastructure either operate individually or lead teams of lessskilled actors. Those operating individually are connected through social media to
other local actors with similar skills, as well as international actors using the same
tools. Likewise, those leading teams maintain the same social network connections
but are often referred to as “boss” on their social media profiles by the actors
they support. A prime example can be seen in a recent threat report released by
SecureWorks® in which one actor was discovered to be supporting upward of
30 subordinates. In this arrangement, the boss typically registers the malware
infrastructure, establishes a folder structure to support each subordinate, and then
provides training on the tools, likely in exchange for a portion of the profits.
While Unit 42 has identified roughly 100 individuals with the skills required to
establish this type of malware infrastructure, our data similarly showed that a
small subset of these actors appear to be leading teams of between 4 and 30
subordinate actors.

Social Media Networks
The majority of SilverTerrier actors are very active on social media, with the two most
prevalent networks being Facebook and Google+. However, while both of these
networks provide a means for individuals to express themselves and share ideas,
Nigerian actors use them to accomplish two distinctly different purposes.
For these actors, Facebook accounts typically represent legitimate depictions of their
personal lives. These profiles contain their true names, links to family members, and
connections to friends from their high school, college and hometown. In that mix, one
typically finds links to local law enforcement, educational mentors and community
religious leaders, as well as their criminal peers and subordinates. Additionally, while
these profiles often contain images flaunting wealth and success, they tend to contain
very few blatant links to criminal activity or tools. Of course, there are a few instances
in which connections claim affiliation with the Anonymous hacking group, or users are
attempting to sell malware tools on their wall, but by and large, this activity is generally
an exception rather than the norm on Facebook’s platform.

Figure 1 + Examples of SilverTerrier actors flaunting success on Facebook
Conversely, the actors’ Google+ profiles appear to be built for the purpose of
supporting their illegitimate activities. While their Facebook profiles are linked to
their personal email addresses, their Google+ profiles are most often linked to email
accounts used to register malicious domains. As a result, these accounts typically
contain fewer than ten connections, most of which are to other nefarious individuals
or organizations. Furthermore, this platform serves as a conduit in connecting local
criminals to international tools and capabilities while maintaining some degree of
privacy and anonymity. By mapping this network, Unit 42 has successfully identified
the linkage between Nigerian actors and such tools as NanoCore Remote Access
Trojan, HawkEye Keylogger, Aegis Crypter and Orway Crypter.
More importantly, this mapping effort has enabled the identification of a small
number of individuals who appear to serve as the connective tissue between various
subsets of Nigerian actors and the tools they use. While these individuals have not
been linked directly to malware infrastructure themselves, conclusions about their

importance and overall role with respect to Nigerian cybercrime can be deduced
simply from their connections. This analysis thus informs a generic understanding of
the network that looks like this:

With an understanding of this generic model, it becomes possible to create products
that blend the information provided by both platforms. Doing so produces a wealth
of insights into these criminal organizations. Most notably, this method can be used
to establish connections between aliases on Google+ and actors’ true identities on
Facebook. Once these links are established, second order analysis can easily be
conducted to identify commonalities, degrees of separation, and levels of influence
between organizations and individual actors. One such example can be seen below:

Current Tactics
At any point in time, many of these actors are engaged in multiple categories of
scams ranging from their traditional 419 emails, to fake websites, to the most
recent malware initiatives. Thus, in order to account for the range of their activities,
it becomes necessary to discuss the domains that SilverTerrier actors are building to
support their activities. These domains can be grouped into three generic categories:
self-named, fake organizations, and impersonation of legitimate organizations.

Self-Named
These domains either have a personal meaning to the actor that is not readily
apparent to an outside observer, or they contain names that are linked directly to
the actor’s identity. For example, an actor using the alias of “Spy” and an
organization of “Kabospy” established the following three domains: Kabospy[.]com,
Kabospy1[.]com and Kabospyz[.]com. In this case, these three domains were all
used to support malware activities; however, this category has also been observed
as having the widest scope of use overall. Depending on the specific actor in
question, these domains range in use from seemingly legitimate activities, to
frauds and scams, to supporting malware.

Fake Organizations
The concept of standing up fake organizations is a trend that expanded in the gap
between traditional 419 email scams and their adaptation to malware, but it remains
popular among Nigerian actors today given the versatility that these sites provide.
These domains are typically configured with a full-service website in order to
present a legitimate front to their viewers. Historically, this concept was focused on
the creation of fake financial institutions in order to defraud unsuspecting victims.
Recently, we have seen instances of this trend expanding to incorporate other
industries, including manufacturing companies and, in some instances, charities in
order to support both fraud and malware campaigns. It is also important to note that,
over the course of the past few years, these websites have evolved in complexity.
Early attempts by the actors to develop these websites often included grammatical
errors and clunky interfaces that led average computer users to question the nature
of the websites. Modern versions now demonstrate an enhanced level of web
design proficiency and project a more professional appearance.

As an example, the following two websites are registered to the same Nigerian actor.
Looking at each website independently, both appear to be professional products.
Links are active, the search bar works, and they contain contact information, a map of
London, pictures, and biographies of company leadership. However, upon inspecting
the websites as a pair, it quickly becomes evident that they are mirror images of one
another, with only slight discrepancies. References to “Mg & Associates” stand out,
and the profiles of company leadership also prove to be suspect as they are reused
across various websites owned by this actor.

Separately, this next example represents an illegitimate charity. While the site
presents an appearance consistent with what one might expect from a charitable
organization, a closer look reveals a number of discrepancies that should raise
alarms. For contact information, the main office in the United Kingdom is actually
a facility that provides temporary and virtual office space. Similarly, their location in
the United States is a non-existent address that resolves to a parking lot associated
with a major corporation. Lastly, the donation page indicates that it is under
construction, but visitors are encouraged to make donations through Western Union
or MoneyGram.

Impersonating Legitimate Organizations
The last category is comprised of domains that are designed to impersonate
legitimate organizations. Organization names for these domains are slightly modified
from their real-world counterparts, and in most instances, the domains do not contain
functioning user-friendly websites. Instead, these domains are used to host email
services in support of malware distribution, or they provide command-and-control
(C2) services for malware to post stolen user credentials.
SilverTerrier actors have been observed using this technique to impersonate
organizations in the healthcare, education, sports, technology, public transportation,
international freight and finance industries. More concerning is the fact that
recently this technique has expanded to include the full spectrum of government
organizations, including law enforcement, military and diplomatic entities.

Email Distribution
Of the thousands of samples analyzed by Unit 42, the overwhelming majority of
malware was distributed to target organizations through email. These email messages
followed two distinctly different patterns depending on the target of the attack.
When targeting individuals, these emails provided a direct value proposition to their
targets. In this case, emails generally originated from impersonated shipping, banking
or law enforcement organizations. For example, when shipping companies were used,
emails informed their recipients that a package was pending delivery, and attached
was a malware file disguised as a tracking confirmation document. Emails appearing
to come from banking organizations often contained subjects indicating an issue
pertaining to a refund or transfer of funds. When law enforcement organizations were
used, the emails contained attachments that were crafted to look like evidence relating
to the target. Over a period of five days in May 2016, this specific approach was seen
in over 6,800 emails sent with a subject of “Warning from the FBI” and an attachment
called “Your File.exe,” which was, in fact, Predator Pain malware.
Separately, when targeting businesses and large organizations, the emails were sent
from impersonated business partners or those seeking to initiate future business
prospects with the target organization. Additionally, in cases of Business Email
Compromise (BEC), emails originated from compromised accounts internal to the
organization. While these emails contained a wide variation of subjects and filename
combinations, they all tended to align with the general themes of invoices, purchase
orders, new orders, and requests for quotes.

Motivation
Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Business Email Spoofing (BES) are two
attack techniques that have recently gained popularity among SilverTerrier actors.
In both approaches, the actors employ methods designed to fool victims into
authorizing electronic bank transfers. The subtle difference between the two is that
BES involves the use of fake email accounts, whereas BEC attacks typically use
compromised accounts or systems from victim organizations. Common usage of the
term “BEC” typically refers to both methods.

PA L O A LT O N E T W O R K S

S I LV E R T E R R I E R

12

History has shown that the behavior of these actors has traditionally been financially
motivated for personal gain. Fraudulent websites and 419 email scams both provide a
steady stream of income consistent with their motivations. However, the success of
these tactics is generally constrained by the overall wealth of their individual victims.
Conversely, the allure of BEC is that it targets organizations rather than individuals.
As a direct result, the return on investment for targeting organizations is generally
significantly higher.
That said, our dataset enables the identification of individual attacks and the
techniques used, but it lacks the details associated with the actors’ monetization
efforts, as those are typically only known by the victim organizations. However,
given the fact that these techniques are known to be prevalent among Nigerian
actors, and their domain registration activity is also indicative of BEC activity, it is our
assessment that these actors are likely using the methods described above in order
to support BEC schemes for personal gain.

Victims
The ability to provide accurate metrics for the victims of these attacks presents a
unique challenge for cybersecurity analysts. This information is clearly valuable, as it
supports the capability to quantify the level of success being achieved by Nigerian
actors. However, the issue lies in distinguishing between individuals and organizations
that were targets of these attacks, as compared with the organizational systems that
were actually compromised by the malware. Most security vendors have ample data
on which of their customers were targeted and how those attacks were launched.
Yet, the ability of a security vendor to track victim metrics depends entirely on the
victim’s 1) ability to identify the malware infection, and more importantly, 2) willingness
to acknowledge and report the compromise in an environment where doing so often
results in negative impacts to their business model. Given these constraints, drawing
conclusions concerning victims and the overall success rates of Nigerian actors is
best achieved through a review of recent reports, law enforcement actions, and any
information that can be obtained from malicious domains.
As a starting point, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) publishes an
annual report that documents the trends associated with United States’ victims
who have reported losses as a result of criminal cyber activity. While these reports
do not draw distinctions between the perpetrators of malware losses, they do
outline specific metrics associated with traditional 419 scams, which shed light on
the historical successes that these actors have seen. In 2001, Nigerian 419 scams
represented 15.5 percent of the total reports received, with the average loss per
victim being $5,575. Over the years, these numbers have declined as internet users
have become more aware of the threat. In 2008, Nigerian actors represented only
7.5 percent of the total reports received with the average loss dropping to $1,650
per victim. While this seems like a positive trend, last year’s report sought to provide
additional quantification in order to draw contrast between average losses and total
losses. Overall in 2015, there were 30,855 victims of 419/Overpayment scams,

PA L O A LT O N E T W O R K S

+

S I LV E R T E R R I E R

13

resulting in losses in excess of $49 million. While those numbers are significant, the
gains achieved through current malware and BEC schemes appear to be far greater.
On August 1, 2016, Interpol released a press report detailing the arrest of a Nigerian
actor named “Mike.” According to the report, he is believed to be responsible for
worldwide losses in excess of $60 million with over $15.4 million originating from
just one victim.
Separately, on August 4, 2016, researchers from SecureWorks released a report
identifying another group of Nigerian actors actively using malware to support BEC
activity. In this case, one of the criminals was infected with the malware, thus
affording the researchers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the criminal
organization. What they found was that the group had one individual who provided
all of the technical support, infrastructure and training to more than 30 subordinates.
Combined, this one group has gains estimated at $3-6 million per year, with an
average loss for victim businesses of $30,000 to $60,000.
Shifting focus to the victims themselves, a review of the publicly available
information hosted on active, but misconfigured, malware servers provided many
interesting insights. While this approach only worked on a very small subset of the
over 500 malware domains associated with these actors, the results showed that, on
average, each domain contained victim data for between 5 and 15 organizations, thus
informing a rough estimate of potentially 2,500 to 7,500 victims worldwide.
The majority of the victims were located in the Middle East and Asia, with a smaller
subset in Europe and North America. All of the victims ran Microsoft Windows
operating systems, many of which contained traditional endpoint antivirus solutions.
Additionally, several of these systems were observed to contain timecard, billing and
inventory software.
In almost every case, the victims were individual accounts on organizational and
business computers rather than personal computers. In some cases, the malicious
emails were sent to generic business accounts (info@organization[.]com), and in
others, they were sent to specific users (user@organization[.]com). These emails
originated from a wide array of sources to include spoofed and compromised
accounts. For example, in one instance, the malicious email originated from an
account appearing to belong to a foreign law enforcement official.
The victim organizations also ranged in size from small to medium-sized businesses
with both local and global footprints. These organizations largely aligned with
manufacturing, construction and other sales-oriented industries. However, while
Nigerian actors focus their malware efforts against targets they believe to be
profitable, this activity is sometimes indiscriminate and can result in significant
secondary impacts to the international community. For example, one such victim
identified by Unit 42 was an organization that serves as the intermediary between
international telecom providers and their national government, in order to shape
domestic policy. In cases such as these, the risks to society become an order of
magnitude greater, ultimately placing these cyber actors on a different playing
field from those traditionally thought of as low-level cybercriminals.

Conclusions
Over the past two years, Nigerian cybercriminal activity transitioned from 419-style
scams to the active deployment of malware. What started as a small group of actors
in 2014 has now grown to over 100 individuals, resulting in substantial year-after-year
growth in this line of criminal activity.
Over the same period, multiple security vendors have produced reports documenting
the actions of individual Nigerian actors and groups. Given the evidence available,
these reports often implied a correlation between the simplicity of the malware tools
used and the overall competence of the actors. Because of this trend, if CEOs were
to ask their IT staff today whether they would consider Nigerian actors to be a threat,
the answer they would likely hear is: “No, they use unsophisticated tools that are
both easily detected and defeated.” Yet, when the scope of research is expanded
beyond a singular case to encompass more than 100 actors and groups, Unit 42
has found evidence that suggests the contrary. Simple tools being employed with
a degree of precision and mastery should be worthy of concern, as they present a
considerable threat.
While next-generation security solutions are highly effective at identifying Nigerian
cybercriminal activity, traditional antivirus solutions are far less successful. An
analysis of over 8,400 malware hashes submitted to VirusTotal showed an average
identification rate of only 52 percent across vendors. This presents challenges to
businesses worldwide that rely on legacy endpoint products alone to protect their
employees when traveling outside the more sophisticated protections corporate
networks typically provide.
Additionally, these actors are becoming organized; they are no longer individuals and
small groups operating independently. Instead, SilverTerrier actors are using social
media platforms to develop complex networks in support of their illicit activities.
These networks provide a means to efficiently share tools, techniques and best
practices. Furthermore, these efforts have enabled these actors to develop links to
international criminal groups while also providing an opportunity for them to obtain
the latest malware, packing software and tutorials. In this sense, they have begun to
demonstrate traits indicative of small-scale organized crime.
Finally, these attacks have matured. Businesses have become the primary focus of
Nigerian cybercrime, and the losses have already proven to be substantial. Proof of
an individual actor’s ability to steal $60 million, as well as evidence that groups using
these techniques have been successful at stealing $3–6 million annually, should be
considered a measure of their criminal competence.
Because of these traits, it is our assessment that Nigerian actors have demonstrated
a clear growth in size, scope, complexity and capability over the past two years, and
as a direct result, they should now be regarded as a formidable threat to businesses
worldwide.

Protection & Mitigation
The best defense against these evolving threats is a security posture that favors
prevention. Customers of Palo Alto Networks are protected from this threat in the
following ways:
1.

Domains used by these actors have been flagged as malicious in Threat
Prevention.

2.

WildFire™ threat analysis service accurately identifies samples associated with
these malware families.

In addition to these protections, organizations are also encouraged to review the
controls they have in place to prevent successful phishing attacks. Reeling in Those
Pesky Phishing Attacks is a great resource that provides a list of best practices.
However, more specifically, network security staff should also take steps to identify
the individuals within their organizations who manage “info@companyname[.]com”
and similar accounts as well as the individuals who manage sales functions with
new clients. Given the tactics employed by Nigerian actors, special attention should
be given towards ensuring controls are in place to protect those employees from
tailored phishing attempts and malware disguised as new orders.
AutoFocus users can view malware associated with these attacks using the
PredatorPain, ISR Stealer, KeyBase, ISpySoftware and Pony tags or the SilverTerrier
campaign tag.
A complete list of the malware domains associated with SilverTerrier actors can be
