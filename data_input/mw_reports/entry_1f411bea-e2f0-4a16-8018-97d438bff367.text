The operator of the Colonial Pipeline learned it was in trouble at daybreak on May 7, when
an employee found a ransom note from hackers on a control-room computer. By that night,

Joseph Blount, CEO of Colonial Pipeline Co., told The Wall Street Journal that he authorized
the ransom payment of $4.4 million because executives were unsure how badly the
cyberattack had breached its systems, and consequently, how long it would take to bring the
pipeline back.
