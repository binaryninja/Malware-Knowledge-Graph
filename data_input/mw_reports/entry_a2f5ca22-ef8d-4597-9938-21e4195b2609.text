Hancitor Continues to Push Cobalt Strike
thedfirreport.com/2021/06/28/hancitor-continues-to-push-cobalt-strike/
June 28, 2021

First observed in 2014, Hancitor (also known as Chanitor and Tordal) is a downloader
trojan that has been used to deliver multiple different malware such as Pony, Vawtrak,
and DELoader. [1]
Here’s some great write ups on Hancitor:

Case Summary
In this short intrusion, the threat actor gained initial access on a system through a maldoc
campaign which made use of the Hancitor downloader. The first-stage DLL, which was
dropped by a malicious Word document, attempted to download multiple malware payloads
1/18

on the beachhead system, including Ficker Stealer. In addition, a Cobalt Strike beacon
payload was downloaded, and deployed to perform post-exploitation activities. Once inside
the target environment, port scans and a large amount of ICMP traffic was observed–to
identify additional active systems. After about 20 minutes, the threat actor copied a batch
script file and DLL file to another system using the SMB protocol. A remote service was
installed to start the batch file, which executed the Cobalt Strike shellcode-embedded DLL.
On the second compromised system, various discovery-related commands were executed
before going silent. The threat actors were evicted before completing their mission.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More
information on this service and others can be found here. One of the Cobalt Strike servers
used in this intrusion was known about as far back as February and the other 2 were added
to our Threat Feed on 5/20/21.
We also have artifacts available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape
packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services.

MITRE ATT&CK v9
Initial Access
The Hancitor malware was embedded in a macro-based Word document. This single-paged
document contained a picture with instructions, attempting to lure the victim into enabling
macros.

When the macro was enabled, the infection chain started, and the first-stage Hancitor DLL
was dropped to disk.
Reviewing the macro we can see that in sub yyy (towards the bottom) content within the
document is being copied and used to create a file object by sub xxx which then is executed
by the shell call to rundll32.

4/18

5/18

Looking at the strings of the word document, we can see that there’s an embedded OLE
object, which appears to be a PE file.

Execution
The malicious Hancitor DLL in the OLE object, named “rem.r”, was executed via rundll32.exe
by passing the entry point “ESLMJYVFM”.

6/18

The botnet ID and C2 were extracted using Hatching Triage:

Later on in the intrusion, the threat actor used the following command to execute a Cobalt
Strike Beacon on another machine:
rundll32.exe c:\programdata\95.dll,TstSec 11985756

Defense Evasion
On the beachhead system, the malicious Hancitor DLL injected into the svchost.exe process.
The code was injected into multiple instances of svchost.exe.

Memory analysis also shows suspicious memory protections (page_execute_readwrite) and
regions of the particular process.

Finally, when looking at the process tree, we can identify the unusual parent-child process
relationship of rundll32.exe starting svchost.exe.

The svchost.exe process, in turn, injected a Cobalt Strike beacon into multiple rundll32.exe
instances. One of the injected rundll32.exe instance was also observed connecting to the
Cobalt Strike C2 server.

7/18

In addition, the malicious 95.dll, which was observed during the lateral movement phase, is
also designed to evade automated sandbox analysis. This DLL is crafted in such a way that
it wouldn’t show malicious behavior if an exported function is not called by passing a specific
parameter. The DLL contains the Cobalt Strike shellcode and will only execute if the
“11985756” parameter is passed to the TstSec function.

After extracting the Cobalt Strike shellcode from 95.dll and emulating it via scdbg, we found
that it’s connecting to 162.244.83[.]95 over port 8080.

Since 95.dll was executed by rundll32.exe, and from the host logs, it is evident that
rundll32.exe connected to 162.244.83[.]95 over port 8080.

Packet analysis to the IP address mentioned above, shows that it’s downloading the Cobalt
Strike beacon by initiating a HTTP GET request to /hVVH URI.

8/18

Once downloaded, the stager allocates a new memory region inside the current rundll32.exe
process and loads it into the memory and starts the C2 activity.

Discovery
On the beachhead system, the threat actor started exploring their options to move laterally
within the target network. The logged-on user account was utilized to interact with IPC$
shares.

For one specific system, for which the threat actor showed interest, the contents of the C$
share was listed–we assess, to verify if the account had access permissions to the share
before copying the malware to it:

The threat actor also pinged one of the Active Directory domain controllers from the
beachhead machine.

A high amount of ICMP traffic, targeting various Class-A subnets ranges, was observed and
used to identify other active systems within the environment.

On the second system, to which the adversary laterally moved (see section below), the
following discovery commands were executed:

9/18

nltest /domain_trusts
net view /domain
net time

Lateral Movement
The injected svchost process dropped two files: a batch-file named: “95.bat” and a DLL-file
named: “95.dll”. Both files were copied to the ProgramData folder of another system within
the environment.

The content of the batch file can be seen below–it executes the transferred DLL and then
deletes itself:

To execute the batch file, the threat actor installed, and started, a remote service on the other
system.

10/18

Credential Access
An attempt to open lsass.exe process was observed on the system where lateral movement
occurred but there were no signs of successful read attempts.

Command and Control
In the network traffic, we can identify a data stream pattern that is distinctive to Hancitor
malware.

First, the malware performed a lookup of the external IP-address of the infected system (1).
This was followed by Hancitor C2 traffic, sent via HTTP POST requests, which included
unique attributes of the infected system, such as hostname and username information (2).
Hancitor then attempted to download additional malware. This included the info-stealer
known as “Ficker Stealer” (4), for which the DNS traffic corresponds to a recent article posted
by Brad. However, in our case, the post infection HTTP traffic of Ficker Stealer was not
observed.

11/18

Hancitor also attempted to download Cobalt Strike stagers (.bin files) (3), and Cobalt Strike
traffic was sent both encrypted and unencrypted (5).
