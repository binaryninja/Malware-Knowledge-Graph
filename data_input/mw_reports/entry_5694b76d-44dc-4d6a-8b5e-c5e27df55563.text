APT15 Background
Coincidentally, following the recent hack of a US Navy contractor and
theft of highly sensitive data on submarine warfare, we have found
evidence of very recent activity by a group referred to as APT15,
known for committing cyber espionage which is believed to be
affiliated with the Chinese government. The malware involved in this
recent campaign, MirageFox, looks to be an upgraded version of a
tool, a RAT believed to originate in 2012, known as Mirage.
APT15 is known for committing cyberespionage against companies
and organizations located in many different countries, targeting
different sectors such as the oil industry, government contractors,
military, and more. They are known for “living off the land,” meaning
they use already available tools and software installed on the
computer to operate, and once inside a target network, they will tailor
their malware specifically to the target. Other names for the group are
Vixen Panda, Ke3chang, Royal APT, and Playful Dragon.
There are many articles and researches online about APT15 and their
activities, the most recent one by NCC Group; although posted in
March 2018, it refers to a campaign in 2017. In addition, although the
2017 campaign has been documented, during our research regarding
MirageFox, we found a recently uploaded binary (6/8/2018) from the
2017 campaign, pretty much identical to a RAT mentioned in their
RoyalAPT report, barely detected with only 7/66 detections on
VirusTotal.

APT15 Code Reuse
We found the new version of the RAT on VirusTotal hunting, by a YARA
signature we created based off code only found in Mirage and Reaver,
both attributed to Chinese government affiliated groups. After seeing
that these binaries were new uploads to VirusTotal, with very few
detections, we analyzed them using Intezer Analyze™ to see if we
could find any code reuse.

As can be seen in this code reuse analysis report (SHA256:
28d6a9a709b9ead84aece250889a1687c07e19f6993325ba5295410a478da30a),
there is shared code with Mirage and Reaver. The compilation
timestamp is from June 8, 2018 while the upload date to VirusTotal
was June 9, 2018.

(VirusTotal)
On VirusTotal, we can see there are only 10/66 detections for this
binary, 11/66 for another similar version of MirageFox (SHA256:
97813e76564aa829a359c2d12c9c6b824c532de0fc15f43765cf6b106a32b9a5),
and 9/64 for the third MirageFox binary that was uploaded (SHA256:
b7c1ae10f3037b7645541acb9f7421312fb1e164be964ee7acd6eb1299d6acb2).

Here’s a couple examples of code reuse similarities found in the
Mirage family between one of the newer binaries and older ones.
Remote Shell:

The function above is seen throughout many of the binaries in the
Mirage family and is executed when a command is sent from the
C&C. It is responsible for executing commands in cmd.exe (later down
in the functions, not seen in the screenshot, it looks for cmd.exe and
executes it using CreateProcessA).
Configuration Decryption:

Another small, but same important function in the photo above, is the
function for decrypting the data containing the C&C configuration.
Similar to Reaver as posted by Palo Alto, it gets the IP or domain of the
C&C server, the port, name of the binary, a sleep timer, and what Palo
Alto calls a “campaign identifier.”

Technical Details
At this moment, we were unable to retrieve the original infection
vector and other information regarding what other tools the APT15
group is using to attack their targets. We are able to come up with a
few very interesting conclusions about what is going on here,
although we cannot say for sure what the case is without the full
context.
Firstly, the reason this has been named MirageFox instead of just
Mirage, is because in the Export directory for the modules, the name
field is filled with a string MirageFox_Server.dat.

Evidently in the image, you can see there is an exported function. The
MirageFox binaries export a function called dll_wWinMain, the name of
an export in vsodscpl.dll, a module by McAfee that is loaded by a few
of their executables that import and call this function. This most likely
means there is some type of DLL hijacking going on by distributing a
legitimate McAfee binary with MirageFox to load up the DLL properly
into a legitimate looking process. DLL hijacking techniques have been
seen in the past with the APT15 group. The problem here is that once
the export is called the first time, the module renames itself to
sqlsrver.dll and there is no evidence within the module of any type of
persistence. By renaming it to this, the future executions of the RAT
will not be through a McAfee binary. The future persistence could be
setup through another component of the malware or even a
command sent by the C&C to the infected computer.
The most interesting part is the decrypted C&C configuration, as can
be seen in the image below.

Decrypted Config:
C&C IP: 192.168.0.107
Port: 80
Sleep Timer: 30000
Campaign Identifier: Mirage

If you look at it the decrypted configuration, you may notice that the IP
being used for the C&C is an internal IP address. If you read the report
mentioned above about RoyalAPT by NCC Group, it is mentioned that
APT15 infiltrated an organization again after stealing a VPN private
key, therefore we can assume this version was tailor made to an
organization they have already infiltrated and are connecting to the
internal network using a VPN.

The rest of MirageFox functions similarly to previous malware created
by APT15, first collecting information about the computer like the
username, CPU information, architecture, and so forth. Then it sends
this information to the C&C, opens a backdoor, and sits waiting for

commands from the C&C with functionality such as modifying files,
launching processes, terminating itself, and more functionality
typically seen in APT15’s RATs.

Conclusion
There is high confidence that MirageFox can be attributed to APT15
due to code and other similarities in the MirageFox binaries. As is
known about APT15, after infiltrating their target, they conduct a lot of
reconnaissance work, send the commands from the C&C manually,
and will customize their malware components to best suit the
environment they have infected.
