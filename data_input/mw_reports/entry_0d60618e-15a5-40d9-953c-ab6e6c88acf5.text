Last week researchers found the critical vulnerability CVE-2022-22965 in Spring – the open
source Java framework. Using the vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a
remote web server, which makes CVE-2022-22965 a critical threat, given the Spring
framework’s popularity. By analogy with the infamous Log4Shell threat, the vulnerability was
named Spring4Shell.

CVE-2022-22965 and CVE-2022-22963: technical details
CVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell, SpringShell) is a vulnerability in the Spring Framework that
uses data binding functionality to bind data stored within an HTTP request to certain objects
used by an application. The bug exists in the getCachedIntrospectionResults method, which
can be used to gain unauthorized access to such objects by passing their class names via
an HTTP request. It creates the risks of data leakage and remote code execution when
special object classes are used. This vulnerability is similar to the long-closed CVE-20101622, where class name checks were added as a fix so that the name did not match
classLoader or protectionDomain. However, in a newer version of JDK an alternative method
exists for such exploitation, for example, through Java 9 Platform Module System
functionality.

So an attacker can overwrite the Tomcat logging configuration and then upload a JSP web
shell to execute arbitrary commands on a server running a vulnerable version of the
framework.
A vulnerable configuration consists of:
JDK version 9+
Apache Tomcat for serving the application
Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17 and 5.2.0 to 5.2.19 and below
application built as a WAR file
CVE-2022-22963 is a vulnerability in the routing functionality of Spring Cloud Function that
allows code injection through Spring Expression Language (SpEL) by adding a special
spring.cloud.function.routing-expression header to an HTTP request. SpEL is a special
expression language created for Spring Framework that supports queries and object graph
management at runtime. This vulnerability can also be used for remote code execution.
A vulnerable configuration consists of:
Spring Cloud Function 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older versions

Mitigations for Spring vulnerabilities exploitation
CVE-2022-22965 is fixed in 2.6.6; see the Spring blog for details.
To fix CVE-2022-22963, you also need to install the new Spring Cloud Function versions;
see the VMware website for details.
To detect exploitation attempts, ensure that Advanced Exploit Prevention and Network Attack
Blocker features are enabled. Some techniques used during exploitation can be seen in
other exploits that we detect, which is why the verdict names can differ.

APT trends report Q1 2022

5/7

This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
