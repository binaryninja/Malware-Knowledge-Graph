August 5, 2021

A new ransomware group is emerging on the darkweb, looking for affiliates to start its
operations. This group calls itself BlackMatter and has posted ads on two cybercrime forums
named Exploit[.]in, and XSS[.]is. The BlackMatter ransomware group is seeking
cybercriminals already having access to the potential target’s networks. In RaaS, the
ransomware group creates ransomware and a platform to manage the possible targets and
victims.

BlackMatter Threat Summary (Available to enterprise customers since July 21)

Technical Analysis:
Cyble Research Labs found the post on XSS[.]is by the threat actor named BlackMatter, as
shown in Figure 1. In the post, the TA has mentioned the conditions required for affiliates to
join them, which are as follows:
Corporate Networks should be from one of the following countries: the United States of
America, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain.
They are targeting all organizations except the medical industry and government
institutions.

The revenue of the target organization should be more than $100 million and should be
having 500-1500 hosts.
The networks on which other actors have already tried attacks are excluded from the
target list.

The TA has given two options for affiliation. The first option offers to buy network access for
an amount ranging from $3k to $100k. In the second option, affiliates may work with the
group in place of a percentage in ransom. Once the affiliates are selected, they need to
deposit $120,000 to the group to participate in their ransomware activity.

The TA has posted a similar threat post on another cybercrime forum named Exploit[.]in. The
TA post is shown in Figure 2.

We found that the leak website of the BlackMatter ransomware group is hosted in the TOR
network (Figure 3). The Home page shows buttons for media updates and contact. The
Home page displays the message, “All blogs hidden for now. For a very short time.” It
indicates that the group has started its operations.

When we clicked on the button for media updates, we were redirected to the Media page, as
shown in Figure 4. It also displays information such as excluded targets and messages to the
media. Following is the list of excluded targets:
Hospitals.
Critical infrastructure facilities (nuclear power plants, power plants, water treatment
facilities).
Oil and gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries).
Defense industry.
Non-profit companies.
Government sector.
Referring to the above list, we can say that the ransomware group is targeting private
organizations so that they can continue their operations without getting media attention. We
can imply that attackers are aware of the consequences of compromising highly sensitive
targets. Based on rules and about us information given on the BlackMatter ransomware leak
website, we suspect that this group has close connections with the DarkSide ransomware
group. We presume that the group is only interested in the money.

Conclusion:
The BlackMatter ransomware group tries to gain access to critical servers from other threat
actors in order to launch its campaign. Organizations should perform security scanning and
immediate patching of known vulnerabilities using various processes such as Vulnerability
Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), Red teaming, and Purple teaming.
Cyble Research Labs is continuously monitoring BlackMatter activities. We will keep
informing our clients with recent updates about this campaign.

Our Recommendations:
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.

5/6

Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other
connected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected
devices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their
authenticity.
