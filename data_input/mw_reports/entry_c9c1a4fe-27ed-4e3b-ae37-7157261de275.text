FLASH Number

CU-000153-MW

The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential
use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. This data is provided in order
to help cyber security professionals and system administrators to guard against the persistent malicious
actions of cyber actors. This FLASH was coordinated with DHS/CISA.
This FLASH has been released TLP: WHITE

WE NEED YOUR HELP! If you identify any suspicious activity within your enterprise or have related information,

please contact the FBI immediately with respect to the procedures outlined in the Reporting Notice section
of this message.

Indicators of Compromise Associated with Ranzy Locker
Ransomware
Summary
The FBI first identified Ranzy Locker ransomware in late 2020 when the variant began to target
victims in the United States. Unknown cyber criminals using Ranzy Locker ransomware had
compromised more than 30 US businesses as of July 2021. The victims include the construction
subsector of the critical manufacturing sector, the academia subsector of the government
facilities sector, the information technology sector, and the transportation sector.
A majority of victims reported the actors conducted a brute force attack targeting Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials to gain access to the victims’ networks. Recent victims
reported the actors leveraged known Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and phishing as
the means of compromising their networks. The actors attempted to locate important files to
exfiltrate, such as customer information, PII related files, and financial records. Ranzy Locker is
deployed to encrypt files on compromised Windows host systems (including servers and virtual
machines) and attached network shares. The Ranzy Locker executable leaves a ransom note in
all directories where encryption occurred demanding the victim pay a ransom in exchange for a

TLP: WHITE
decryption tool. In an example of double extortion techniques, Ranzy actors in some cases
have demanded a second ransom from the victim in exchange for not leaking the data on the
Internet.

Technical Details and Indicators
The FBI identified the following indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we assess are likely
associated with Ranzy Locker activity.
New User Accounts
The Ranzy Locker actors may establish new accounts on domain controllers, servers,
workstations, or the active directories. Newly created accounts with the name “felix” have been
observed on at least three victims of the ransomware.
Ransom Note
The ransom note for Ranzy Locker has similarities to the wording in both the AKO and ThunderX
ransom notes. 1 An example of the notes is below:

The key found in the ransom note is a base64 encoded string, which when decoded reads:
{"ext":".ranzy","network":"true/false","subID":"####","lang":"xx-XX."}

1

Around October 2020 both AKO and ThunderX rebranded themselves as Ranzy Locker Ransomware.

TLP: WHITE

TLP: WHITE
The .ext extension parameter is typically .ranzy for Ranzy Locker 1.1, and the network
parameter is typically set to true. The lang parameter is the language of the computer, such as
“en-US.”
The subID parameter is an integer and is the name of the Ranzy Locker executable on the
system. For example, if the subid is 0000, then the Ranzy Locker executable’s name is 0000.exe.
Ransomware Executable
The name of the Ranzy Locker executable is the subID found in the key on the ransom note. It is
a 32-bit portable executable (PE), and all samples observed on different victims have different
hash values but identical functionality. The executable requires administrator credentials to
run.
Each Ranzy Locker executable contains the same hex encoded strings. Some of these strings are
commands used to delete any backups on the system. The table below has the hex string,
decoded string, and explanation of the string (if known):

In addition to encrypting files and deleting all backups found on the computer, the Ranzy Locker
executable attempts to move laterally to other machines on the same network.

Recommended Mitigations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Implement regular backups of all data to be stored as air gapped, password protected
copies offline. Ensure these copies are not accessible for modification or deletion from
any system where the original data resides.
Implement network segmentation, such that all machines on your network are not
accessible from every other machine.
Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time
detection.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
updates/patches are released.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with
least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor
remote access/RDP logs for any unusual activity.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Use double authentication when logging into accounts or services.
