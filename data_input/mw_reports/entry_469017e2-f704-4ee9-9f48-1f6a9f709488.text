Introduction
Kaspersky Lab has observed new waves of attacks that started
on the 8th and the 27th of June 2016. These have been highly
active in the Middle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted
attacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets
through spear phishing emails that include compressed
executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords,
keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.

than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been
identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky
Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and
attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March
2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the
attackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through
the victims’ banking accounts or through selling their intellectual
property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations
are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30­300
employees), the utilization of commercial off­the­shelf malware
makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.

In ancient Folklore, the Ghoul is an evil spirit associated with
consuming human flesh and hunting kids, originally a
Mesopotamian demon. Today, the term is sometimes used to
describe a greedy or materialistic individual.

Main infection vector: malicious
emails
The following picture represents emails that are being used to
deliver malware to the victims, in what looks like a payment
document. The e­mails sent by attackers appear to be coming
from a bank in the UAE, the Emirates NBD, and include a 7z file
with malware. In other cases, victims received phishing links. A
quick analysis of the email headers reveals fake sources being
utilised to deliver the emails to victims.

Malicious attachments
In the case of spear phishing emails with an attachment, the 7z
does not contain payment instructions but a malware executable
(EmiratesNBD_ADVICE.exe). We have observed executables
with the following MD5s:

The spear phishing emails are mostly sent to senior members
and executives of targeted organizations, most likely because the
attackers hope to get access to core intelligence, controlling
accounts and other interesting information from people who have
the following positions or similar:

Chief Executive Officer
Chief Operations Officer
General Manager
General Manager, Sales and Marketing
Deputy General Manager
Finance and Admin Manager

Technical details
Malware functionality
The malware is based on the Hawkeye commercial spyware,
which provides a variety of tools for the attackers, in addition to
malware anonymity from attribution. It initiates by self­deploying
and configuring persistence, while using anti­debugging and
timeout techniques, then starts collecting interesting data from the
victim’s device, including:

Keystrokes
Clipboard data
FileZilla ftp server credentials
Account data from local browsers
Account data from local messaging clients (Paltalk, Google
talk, AIM…)
Account data from local email clients (Outlook, Windows Live
mail…)
License information of some installed applications

The IP address 192.169.82.86 seems to belong to a
compromised device running multiple malware campaigns.

Victim information
Victim organizations are distributed in different countries
worldwide with attackers focused on certain countries more than
others:

Number of Victim Organisations by Country

Countries marked as “others” have less than three victim
organizations each, they are: Switzerland, Gibraltar, USA,
Sweden, China, France, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Turkey, Romania, Iran,
Iraq and Italy.

Victim industry information
Victim industry types were also indicators of targeted attacks as
attackers were looking to infiltrate organizations that belong to the
product life cycle of multiple goods, especially industrial
equipment.

Hundreds of detections have been reported by Kaspersky Lab
users; 70% of the attacked users were found in the United Arab
Emirates alone, the other 30% were distributed in Russia,
Malaysia, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria, Germany, Iran,
Egypt, Japan, Switzerland, Bahrain and Tunisia.

Other attack information
Phishing pages have also been spotted through 192.169.82.86,
and although they are taken down quickly, more than 150 user
accounts were identified as victims of the phishing links sent by
the attackers. Victims were connecting from the following devices
and inserting their credentials, a reminder that phishing attacks
do work on all platforms:

Windows
Mac OS X
Ubuntu

The malware files are detected using the following heuristic
signatures:

Trojan.MSIL.ShopBot.ww
Trojan.Win32.Fsysna.dfah
Trojan.Win32.Generic

Conclusion
Operation Ghoul is one of the many attacks in the wild targeting
industrial, manufacturing and engineering organizations,
Kaspersky Lab recommends users to be extra cautious while
checking and opening emails and attachments. In addition,
privileged users need to be well trained and ready to deal with
cyber threats; failure in this is, in most cases, the cause behind
private or corporate data leakage, reputation and financial loss.

Indicators of Compromise
The following are common among the different malware
infections; the presence of these is an indication of a possible
infection.
