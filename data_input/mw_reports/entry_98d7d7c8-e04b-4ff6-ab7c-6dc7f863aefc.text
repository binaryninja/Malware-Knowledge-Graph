Ursnif v.3 aka Dreambot/Gozi/ISFB
This is a simple script that could be used to:
check if a suspicious URL is correlated to Ursnif activity
decrypt the URL check-in on the fly to get the data sent to the C2 server
Usage:
python3 ursnif_beacon_decryptor.py -u <url> -k <key>

A different version inserts the encrypted path as data of a POST request.
In case, use the option -o instead of -u
Example:
Input:
python3 ursnif_beacon_decryptor.py -u
"http://qjdyugisselle.club/images/NM_2Ff8mqmMQjmr/c842xf8TIJp_2FlmC5/Ulz244kFh/KMjQpHV
-k "10291029JSJUYNHG"

Output:

[2019-04-15 11:24:25 - INFO] Congrats! decoded data:
fjidtflrb=bdaxhhfg&soft=3&version=217173&user=a618b5f78c4ff30be60d08c7ba561278&server=

Params:
fjidtflrb -> junk param, always present at the start of the uri to generate randomness
(and always different)
soft -> major version
version -> minor version
user -> unique user id
server -> unique c2 server id
id -> bot group id
crc -> payload to retrieve (1-DLL32b, 2-DLL64b, 3-ps1)
uptime -> time elapsed from initial infection (seconds)
Different versions could have more parametres. Example: hash time action os system
tor

Requirements
Python3
cryptopp library (libcrypto++6 debian repo)
If you run a Linux environment, you can just run the python script that will load Driver.so
that is needed to perform decryption.
If you run a Windows OS, you should re-compile Driver.cpp and change the library
loaded with the new one.
Additional info
The script needs the key that the malware uses for encryption.
Some reverse engineering is required to get that info.
However, observations led to the fact that the key is usually shared among a lot of samples
and rarely changed.
If you don't have one, you could just run the script that would try our predefined keys that we
saw the malware used in the wild
