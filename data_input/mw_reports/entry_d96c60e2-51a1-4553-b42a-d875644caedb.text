The operators of Ryuk ransomware are at it again. After a long period of quiet, we identified
a new spam campaign linked to the Ryuk actors—part of a new wave of attacks. And in late
September, Sophos’ Managed Threat Response team assisted an organization in mitigating
a Ryuk attack—providing insight into how the Ryuk actors’ tools, techniques and practices
have evolved. The attack is part of a recent wave of Ryuk incidents tied to recent phishing
campaigns.
First spotted in August of 2018, the Ryuk gang gained notoriety in 2019, demanding multimillion-dollar ransoms from companies, hospitals, and local governments. In the process, the
operators of the ransomware pulled in over $61 million just in the US, according to figures
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And that’s just what was reported—other estimates
place Ryuk’s take in 2019 in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Starting around the beginning of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a lull in Ryuk
activity. There was speculation that the Ryuk actors had moved on to a rebranded version of
the ransomware, called Conti. The campaign and attack we investigated was interesting both
because it marked the return of Ryuk with some minor modifications, but also showed an
evolution of the tools used to compromise targeted networks and deploy the ransomware.
The attack was also notable because of how quickly the attacks can move from initial
compromise to ransomware deployment. Within three and a half hours of a target opening a
phishing email attachment, attackers were already conducting network reconnaissance.
Within a day, they had gained access to a domain controller, and were in the early stages of
an attempt to deploy ransomware.

The attackers were persistent as well. As attempts to launch the attack failed, the Ryuk
actors attempted multiple times over the next week to install new malware and ransomware,
including renewed phishing attempts to re-establish a foothold. Before the attack had
concluded, over 90 servers and other systems were involved in the attack, though
ransomware was blocked from full execution.

Let the wrong one in

Initial compromise, reconnaissance and lateral movement phase of Ryuk attack
The attack began on the afternoon of Tuesday. September 22. Multiple employees of the
targeted company had received highly-targeted phishing emails:

From: Alex Collins [spoofed external email address]
To: [targeted individual]
Subject: Re: [target surname] about debit
Please call me back till 2 PM, i will be in [company name] office till 2 PM.
[Target surname], because of [company name]head office request #96-9/23 [linked to
remote file], i will process additional 3,582 from your payroll account.
[Target first name], call me back when you will be available to confirm that all is correct.
Here is a copy of your statement in PDF[linked to remote file].

[Company name] outsource specialist
The link, served up through the mail delivery service Sendgrid, redirected to a malicious
document hosted on docs.google.com. The email was tagged with external sender warnings
by the company’s mail software. And multiple instances of the malicious attachment were
detected and blocked.
But one employee clicked on the link in the email that afternoon. The user opened the
document and enabled its content, allowing the document to execute print_document.exe
—a malicious executable identified as Buer Loader. Buer Loader is a modular malware-as-aservice downloader, introduced on underground forums for sale in August of 2019. It
provides a web panel-managed malware distribution service; each downloader build sold for
$350, with add-on modules and download address target changes billed separately.
In this case, upon execution, the Buer Loader malware dropped qoipozincyusury.exe, a
Cobalt Strike “beacon,” along with other malware files. Cobalt Strike’s beacon, originally
designed for attacker emulation and penetration testing, is a modular attack tool that can
perform a wide range of tasks, providing access to operating system features and
establishing a covert command and control channel within the compromised network.
Over the next hour and a half, additional Cobalt Strike beacons were detected on the initially
compromised system. The attackers were then able to successfully establish a foothold on
the targeted workstation for reconnaissance and to hunt for credentials.
A few hours later, the Ryuk actors’ reconnaissance of the network began. The following
commands were run on the initially infected system:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C whoami /groups (accessing list of AD groups the
local user is in)

3/9

C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts (returns a list of
all trusted domains)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C net group “enterprise admins” /domain (returns a
list of members of the “enterprise admins” group for the domain)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\net1 group “domain admins” /domain (the same, but a list of
the group “domain admins”)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C net localgroup administrators (returns a list of
administrators for the local machine)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C ipconfig (returns the network configuration)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:[target company domain name]
(returns names of the domain controllers for the company domain name)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:[target company name] (the same,
but checking for domain controllers using the company name as the domain name)

Forward lateral
Using this data, by Wednesday morning the actors had obtained administrative credentials
and had connected to a domain controller, where they performed a data dump of Active
Directory details. This was most likely accomplished through the use of SharpHound, a
Microsoft C#-based data “injestor” tool for BloodHound (an open-source Active Directory
analysis tool used to identify attack paths in AD environments). A data dump from the tool
was written to a user directory for the compromised domain administrator account on the
domain server itself.
Another Cobalt Strike executable was loaded and launched a few hours later. That was
followed immediately by the installation of a Cobalt Strike service on the domain controller
using the domain administrator credentials obtained earlier. The service was a chained
Server Message Block listener, allowing Cobalt Strike commands to be passed to the server
and other computers on the network. Using Windows Management Interface, the attackers
remotely executed a new Cobalt Strike beacon on the same server.
In short order, other malicious services were created on two other servers using the same
admin credentials, using Windows Management Instrumentation from the initially
compromised PC. One of the services configured was an encoded PowerShell command
creating yet another Cobalt communications pipe.
The actors continued to perform reconnaissance activities from the initially infected desktop,
executing commands trying to identify potential targets for further lateral movement. Many of
these repeated previous commands. The nltest command was used in an attempt to retrieve
data from domain controllers on other domains within the enterprise Active Directory tree.
Other commands pinged specific servers, attempting to gain IP addresses. The actors also
checked against all mapped network shares connected to the workstation and used WMI to
check for active Remote Desktop sessions on another domain controller within the Active
Directory tree.

Setting the trap

Late Wednesday afternoon—less than a day after the victim’s click on the phish— the Ryuk
actors began preparations to launch their ransomware. Using the beachhead on the initially
compromised PC, the attackers used RDP to connect to the domain controller with the admin
credentials obtained the day before. A folder named C:\Perflogs\grub.info.test2 –
Copy was dropped on the domain controller— a name consistent with a set of tools
deployed in previous Ryuk attacks. A few hours later, the attackers ran an encoded
PowerShell command that, accessing Active Directory data, generated a dump file called
ALLWindows.csv, containing login, domain controller and operating system data for
Windows computers on the network.
Next, the SystemBC malicious proxy was deployed on the domain controller. SystemBC is a
SOCKS5 proxy used to conceal malware traffic that shares code and forensic markers with
other malware from the Trickbot family. The malware installed itself (as itvs.exe), and
created a scheduled job for the malware, using the old Windows task scheduler format in a
file named itvs.job—in order to maintain persistence.
A PowerShell script loaded into the grub.info.test folder on the domain controller was
executed next. This script, Get.DataInfo.ps1 , scans the network and provides an output of
which systems are active. It also checks which AV is running on the system.

The Ryuk actors used a number of methods to attempt to spread files to additional servers,
including file shares, WMI, and Remote Desktop Protocol clipboard transfer. WMI was used
to attempt to execute GetDataInfo.ps1 against yet another server.

Failure to launch
Thursday morning, the attackers spread and launched Ryuk. This version of Ryuk had no
substantial changes from earlier versions we’ve seen in terms of core functionality, but
Ryuk’s developers did add more obfuscation to the code to evade memory-based detections
of the malware.
The organizational backup server was among the first targeted. When Ryuk was detected
and stopped on the backup server, the attackers used the icacls command to modify access
control, giving them full control of all the system folders on the server.
They then deployed GMER, a “rootkit detector” tool:

The GMER process hunting tool.
GMER is frequently used by ransomware actors to find and shut down hidden processes,
and to shut down antivirus software protecting the server. The Ryuk attackers did this, and
then they tried again. Ryuk ransomware was redeployed and re-launched three more times
6/9

in short order, attempting to overwhelm remaining defenses on the backup server.
Ransom notes were dropped in the folders hosting the ransomware, but no files were
encrypted.

The Ryuk HTML ransom note.
In total, Ryuk was executed in attacks launched from over 40 compromised systems,but was
repeatedly blocked by Sophos Intercept X. By noon on Thursday, the ransomware portion of
the attack had been thwarted. But the attackers weren’t done trying—and weren’t off the
network yet.
On Friday, defenders deployed a block across the domains affected by the attack for the
SystemBC RAT. The next day, the attackers attempted to activate another SOCKS proxy on
the still-compromised domain controller. And additional Ryuk deployments were detected
over the following week—along with additional phishing attempts and attempts to deploy
Cobalt Strike.

Lessons learned

7/9

The Ryuk attack’s exploitation chain.
The tactics exhibited by the Ryuk actors in this attack demonstrate a solid shift away from
the malware that had been the basis of most Ryuk attacks last year (Emotet and Trickbot).
The Ryuk gang shifted from one malware-as-a-service provider (Emotet) to another (Buer
Loader), and has apparently replaced Trickbot with more hands-on-keyboard exploitation
tools—Cobalt Strike, Bloodhound, and GMER, among them—and built-in Windows scripting
and administrative tools to move laterally within the network. And the attackers are quick to
change tactics as opportunities to exploit local network infrastructure emerge—in another
recent attack Sophos responded to this month, the Ryuk actors also used Windows Global
Policy Objects deployed from the domain controller to spread ransomware. And other recent
attacks have used another Trickbot-connected backdoor known as Bazar.
The variety of tools being used, including off-the-shelf and open-source attack tools, and the
volume and speed of attacks is indicative of an evolution in the Ryuk gang’s operational
skills. Cobalt Strike’s “offensive security” suite is a favorite tool of both state-sponsored and
criminal actors, because of its relative ease of use and broad functionality, and its wide
availability—“cracked” versions of the commercially-licensed software are readily purchased
in underground forums. And the software provides actors with a ready-made toolkit for
exploitation, lateral movement, and many of the other tasks required to steal data, escalate
the compromise and launch ransomware attacks without requiring purpose-made malware.
While this attack happened quickly, the persistence of the attacks following the initial failure
of Ryuk to encrypt data demonstrate that the Ryuk actors—like many ransomware attackers
—are slow to unlatch their jaws, and can persist for long periods of time once they’ve moved
laterally within the network and can establish additional backdoors. The attack also shows
that Remote Desktop Protocol can be dangerous even when it is inside the firewall.
