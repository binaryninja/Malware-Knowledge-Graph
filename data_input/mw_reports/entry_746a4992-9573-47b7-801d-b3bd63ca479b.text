IBM Security X-Force has been tracking the activity of Black Basta, a new ransomware group that first appeared in April
2022. To date, this group has claimed attribution of 29 different victims across multiple industries using a double extortion
strategy where the attackers not only execute ransomware but also steal data and threaten to release it publicly if the

1/9

ransom demands are not met. The data disclosure element of these attacks takes place on a data leak site available on
the Tor network. As a mechanism to apply pressure to coerce the victim to pay the ransom, the operators of Black Basta
will gradually release stolen data on the leak site.
The Black Basta group is still in the early stages of their organization and X-Force has not observed any attempts to
advertise the malware or hire affiliates on underground forums. Due to operational similarities and the absence of
affiliation attempts, it has been reported that Black Basta may potentially be a rebranded version of the Conti gang, a
well-known ransomware group that already has affiliates. However, the Conti group announced on May 12 that they had
no affiliations with the Black Basta ransomware group. X-Force’s assessment of the possible relationship between these
groups is ongoing.
The Black Basta ransomware variant acts at such a high speed that it rarely causes symptoms that would tip off
defenders to the compromise before the ransomware has been deployed.
This blog post will detail X-Force’s insights into the Black Basta ransomware, technical analysis of the sample, and
indicators of compromise (IoC) to help organizations protect themselves from this malware.

X-Force Assessment
Black Basta’s sudden appearance and subsequent high volume of successful compromises highlights the speed with
which ostensibly “new” ransomware groups are able to become central figures in the threat landscape. While this group
has yet to be linked by X-Force to existing or past ransomware operations, the impact that this group has had in such a
short amount of time points to a practiced and effective set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that pose a
significant threat to enterprise networks. Based on current intelligence, it does not appear that Black Basta targets
specific industries or verticals. However, entities that collect large amounts of data that is attractive for extortion
operations such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial information, or other sensitive data, are likely to
stand out as lucrative targets for attackers.
We encourage security practitioners to review the IBM X-Force Definitive Guide to Ransomware and the mitigations
highlighted below, action available IOCs, and ensure that detections are in place to alert on observed malicious
behaviors.
Additional Risk Mitigations:
Establish and maintain backup routines, including offline backups. Ensure you have backup redundancy stored
separately from network zones attackers could access with read-only access. The availability of effective backups
is a significant differentiator for organizations and can support recovery from a ransomware attack.
Implement a strategy to prevent unauthorized data theft, especially as it applies to uploading large amounts of data
to legitimate cloud storage platforms that attackers can abuse.
Employ user behavior analytics to identify potential security incidents. When triggered, assume a breach has taken
place. Audit, monitor and quickly act on suspected abuse related to privileged accounts and groups.
Employ multifactor authentication on all remote access points into an enterprise network — with particular care
given to secure or disable remote desktop protocol (RDP) access. Multiple ransomware attacks have been known
to exploit weak RDP access to gain initial entry into a network.

Ransomware Analysis Details
Behavioral Analysis
Behavioral analysis describes the malware behavior observed on a system during execution. Behavioral analysis
typically includes actions performed on the system such as files dropped, persistence, details surrounding process
execution and any C2 communications. It should be noted that behavioral analysis may not capture all notable malware
behavior as certain functions may only be performed by the malware under specific conditions.
Loader
2/9

Upon execution, the loader base64 decodes a Black Basta payload using the CryptStringToBinaryA() API function. The
decoded payload is then RC4 decrypted using the key “1xJr13puJChWqiMeOnFDDSOmoSmws5n“. Black Basta is then
injected into a process instance of the loader and executed in memory. The injected Black Basta sample has a SHA256
hash: ef1382770f820e4b2e65981bb7b3a62d5f93e3b87763f83012ef7f7cb1bc9469 and compile time: Thursday,
28.04.2022 15:15:43 UTC.
Black Basta
Upon execution, Black Basta conducts the following activity:
Deletes volume shadow copies using the commands:
C:\Windows\SysNative\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
C:\Windows\System32\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet

Changes the desktop background to the following image using the file %Temp%\dlaksjdoiwq.jpg.

Modifies the following registry key to set the desktop background.
HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\Wallpaper = %Temp%\dlaksjdoiwq.jpg

Drops the ICON file %Temp%\fkdjsadasd.ico to the system. This file is used as the default icon for encrypted
files. To set the default icon, the ransomware creates the following registry key.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.basta\DefaultIcon = %Temp%\fkdjsadasd.ico

Drops the ransom note readme.txt in directories where it encrypts files. The company id and ransom note is
hardcoded in the sample. Example id: 18a6cdad-316c-4922-953e-c64bf4959a74.
Your data are stolen and encrypted
The data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom

3/9

Appends the file extension .basta to encrypted files.

Depending on the variant, Black Basta conducts the following activity:
Hijacks the existing Fax service to maintain persistence.
Disables windows recovery and repair with the command:
C:\Windows\SysNative\bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot
C:\Windows\System32\bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot

Reboots the system into safe mode using bcdedit and the shutdown command.
C:\Windows\SysNative\bcdedit.exe /set safeboot network
C:\Windows\System32\bcdedit.exe /set safeboot network
cmd.exe /C shutdown -r -f -t 0

The following files and folders are skipped during encryption:
$Recycle.Bin
Windows
boot
readme.txt
dlaksjdoiwq.jpg
NTUSER.DAT
fkdjsadasd.ico
OUT.txt

Static Analysis
Static analysis is a deeper dive into the technical analysis of the malware. Static analysis typically includes further details
about the functionality, obfuscation or packing in the sample, encryption used by the malware, configuration information
or other notable technical detail.
Loader
The injection process for the loader is as follows:
1. The loader creates a suspended process instance of itself with CreateProcessA().
2. Then it calls GetThreadContext() to get the thread context of the suspended process.
3. Next, it calls ReadProcessMemory() to obtain the suspended process’ image base from the Process Environment
Block retrieved via the thread context.
4. The loader proceeds to allocate memory in the suspended process using VirtualAllocEx() and writes the payload to
the buffer using WriteProcessMemory().
5. Finally, it sets the entry point of the injected payload using SetThreadContext() and executes the injected payload
using ResumeThread().

Notably, samples similar to loader were found in VirusTotal with the following project paths. The payloads of these
samples have not yet been determined.

Black Basta
Encryption

5/9

To start encrypting files, Black Basta calls the FindFirstVolumeW() and FindNextVolumeW() functions to enumerate
volumes on the victim system. For each volume, the ransomware calls GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW() to
obtain a list of drive letters and mounted folder paths for the specified volume. Analysis indicates that Black Basta uses
ChaCha20 encryption during the encryption process. Notably, it is observed that some files are not fully encrypted,
possibly in an effort to hasten the encryption process. Black Basta encrypts some files in 64-byte blocks every 128 bytes
as shown in the example encrypted notepad.exe file below.

Compile Times
The samples’ compile times range from February 2022 to Apr 2022. The earlier samples in February contain a ransom
note indicating the malware name is “no_name_software“.
