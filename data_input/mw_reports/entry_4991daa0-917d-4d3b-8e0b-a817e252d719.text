GRU: Rise of the (Telegram) MinIOns
mandiant.com/resources/blog/gru-rise-telegram-minions

Executive Summary
Mandiant is tracking multiple self-proclaimed hacktivist groups working in support of
Russian interests. These groups have primarily conducted distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks and leaked stolen data from victim organizations. Although some of
these actors are almost certainly operating independently of the Russian state, we
have identified multiple so-called hacktivist groups whose moderators we suspect are
either a front for, or operating in coordination with, the Russian state.
We assess with moderate confidence that moderators of the purported hacktivist
Telegram channels “XakNet Team,” “Infoccentr,” and “CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn” are
coordinating their operations with Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)sponsored cyber threat actors. Our assessment is based in part on the deployment of
GRU-sponsored APT28 tools on the networks of Ukrainian victims, whose data was
subsequently leaked on Telegram within 24 hours of wiping activity by APT28, as well
as other indicators of inauthentic activity by the moderators and similarities to previous
GRU information operations.

The war in Ukraine has also presented novel opportunitiesto understand the totality,
coordination, and effectiveness of Russia cyber programs, including the use of social
media platforms by threat actors. Additionally, platforms such as Telegram were being
used pre-invasion to influence perception of the impending Russian military
movements and have been employed heavily by both Ukraine and Russia to influence
both international and domestic audiences.

Threat Detail
Mandiant is tracking multiple groups claiming to be hacktivists that have targeted Ukraine
since the start of the Russian invasion in early 2022. In particular, Mandiant has focused on
analyzing a set of self-proclaimed hacktivist groups: XakNet Team, Infoccentr, and
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn. Through our analysis, Mandiant has identified new evidence
connecting the moderators of these groups to the Russian state, including timeline analysis
of intrusions and leaks from Ukrainian organizations. In addition to data from Mandiant’s
collection, we want to thank our partners Security Service of Ukraine (Cyber Department)
and Trellix, for their contributions in support of this analysis.
Mandiant has also identified limited links between XakNet Team and the pro-Russia socalled “hacktivist” group KillNet, and we assess with moderate confidence that XakNet and
KillNet have directly coordinated some of their activity. However, we note that the two appear
to conduct aligned but separate missions, based on the observed activity claimed by each of
the "hacktivist" groups. While we continue to separately investigate KillNet, this report's
scope is limited to the three groups we have currently identified as linked to the GRU.

APT28 Wiped Ukrainian Victims Shortly Before Data Leaked on
Social Media
We assess with moderate confidence that threat actors operating the Telegram channels
XakNet Team, Infoccentr, and CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn are coordinating their operations
with GRU-sponsored APT28. This assessment is based primarily on Mandiant’s direct
observations of the deployment of wipers used by APT28 on the networks of multiple
Ukrainian organizations and the subsequent leaks of data by threat actors claiming to be
hacktivists likely originating from those entities on Telegram within 24 hours. We identified at
least 16 data leaks from these groups, four of which coincided with wiping attacks by APT28.
Mandiant has only observed the use of CADDYWIPER and ARGUEPATCH by APT28,
although we note that others have publicly attributed some CADDYWIPER
deployments to Sandworm.

3/11

In two incidents, Mandiant observed APT28 conduct wiper attacks, which were
followed, within 24 hours, by data from the victims being leaked on Telegram. In both
instances APT28 deployed ARGUEPATCH, which dropped CADDYWIPER.
Two additional waves of CADDYWIPER attacks against multiple Ukrainian
organizations were followed, within 24 hours, by leaks of data from Ukrainian entities
onto Telegram. In these cases, Mandiant cannot confirm that the organization whose
data was leaked were victims of the waves of coordinated wiper activity; however, the
timing supports an assessment that they were coordinated.
In one XakNet data leak, Mandiant discovered a unique technical artifact from an APT28
intrusion. This indicates APT28 had access to the same parts of the network the leak was
sourced from.

XakNet Activity Consistent with Historical APT28 Information
Operations
The three channels we identify in this report have claimed activity leveraging traditional
hacktivist tactics, such as using distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website
defacements, and hack-and-leak activity to target their victims. Furthermore, XakNet’s active
solicitation of media coverage, in tandem with its self-promoted narrative of being a group
comprised of Russian patriotic volunteers, suggests two possible influence objectives: the
groups promote Russian interests abroad through their threat activity, and they promote the
idea of average Russians supporting the government to domestic audiences through their
claims to be patriotic volunteers amplified by the Russian media and elsewhere online.
The Russian intelligence services have an extensive history of using false hacktivist
personas to support information operations and disruptive and destructive cyber activity. For
example, this is a particularly well-established tactic of APT28 in activity targeting Ukraine
and elsewhere, prominently including its use in the 2014 compromise, defacement, data
leak, and destruction of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission’s network and website,
which was claimed by the pro-Russia “hacktivist” group CyberBerkut. However, its most
famous instance may be the Guccifer 2.0 false persona APT28 leveraged to interfere in the
2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. Department of Justice indictments related to Russia’s
targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election have indicated that multiple GRU units were
involved in that activity, including the unit to which APT28 is attributed (Unit 26165). We note
this in recognition that it is possible multiple units within the GRU have likewise been
involved in the activity outlined in this report.
Although we assess with moderate confidence that moderators respectively behind XakNet
Team, Infoccentr, and CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn are at least coordinating with the GRU,
we currently reserve judgement as to the composition of these groups and their exact degree

4/11

of affiliation with the GRU. However, at a minimum, this coordination is consistent with
frequent GRU tactics. While the exact nature of the relationship is unclear, it likely falls into
one of two general possibilities:
GRU officers may directly control the infrastructure associated with these actors and
their activities may be a front for GRU operations, similar to the relationship between
the GRU and the false persona Guccifer 2.0.
The moderators respectively running these Telegram channels may directly coordinate
with the GRU; however, the moderators may be Russian citizens who are not Russian
intelligence officers. There are multiple possible configurations through which this
dynamic could manifest, including but not limited to initial GRU support for third parties
to establish the channels or subsequent links established after initial channel creation.
A review of these channels’ activity shows on-platform engagement by hundreds of users. In
either of the above outlined scenarios, it seems likely that some or all the users engaged with
these channels are Russian-speaking civilians who are not intelligence officers. It is possible
that the hundreds of users engaged with these channels are inauthentic, though we judge
that to be unlikely.

Mandiant highlighting possible links between XakNet and the Russian Government. The third
paragraph reads: “But in reality, everything is very simple. IB [information security] does not

exist. Everything can be hacked. You can continue to conduct your super-cool investigations
without any proof.”

XakNet Team Moderators Likely Operate at Behest of the Kremlin
“XakNet Team” is a Russian-language Telegram channel of a self-proclaimed hacktivist
group that has conducted threat activity against Ukraine, including DDoS attacks,
compromises and data leaks, and website defacements. The group claims to be comprised
of Russian patriotic volunteers who formed the group in response to the Anonymous
collective’s declaration of war against Russia. The XakNet Team moderators advertise
multiple domains and social media channels that we have determined are all controlled by
the same group of threat actors. The XakNet Team moderators also claimed involvement in
one of the more notable information operations observed so far in the conflict, when, in early
March, a Ukrainian news organization’s news ticker was defaced during a live TV broadcast
with a fake message of Ukraine’s capitulation to Russia attributed to President Zelenskyy.
We assess with moderate confidence that the moderators of the XakNet Team channel are
directly supported by APT28, based on XakNet’s leak of a technical artifact APT28 employed
during the compromise of a Ukrainian network. Given the unique nature of this technical
artifact, we assess with moderate confidence that the moderators of XakNet Team either are
GRU intelligence officers or work directly with the GRU APT28 operators conducting on-net
operations.

CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn is a Telegram channel Mandiant has tracked since mid-April
2022. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the moderators of
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn are at least coordinating with APT28 due to the timing of the
leaks and the group’s connection to Xaknet, although the exact nature of the relationship is
currently unclear. The channel’s apparent goals include defamation, obtaining press, and
influencing policy. CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn moderators have leaked data from victims in
at least the following industries: data services, local governments, and national governments,
and the actors have claimed to degrade or deny services within a victim organization through
DDoS or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
In at least one-third of the data leaks Mandiant identified from
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn, we directly or indirectly observed APT28 intrusion
operations on the same Ukrainian victim's networks within 24 hours preceding the
leaks.

In several instances, we observed the moderators on this channel leak data in bulk
including all files within a given extension or directory, and/or all files within a given date
range. We identified the moderators leaking the following types of information from
victims:
Files/Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
General military documents
Domestic policies and documents

Infoccentr
On March 4, a Telegram channel for “Infoccentr” was created, which appears to be dedicated
to pro-Russia information operations and to fight against anti-Russian or pro-Ukrainian social
media and other information channels. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the
moderators of the Infoccentr channel are at least coordinating with APT28 due to the timing
of the leaks and the group’s connection to XakNet, although we have not yet determined the

9/11

exact composition of the group. In at least one instance, data that was initially leaked on the
Infoccentr Telegram page was reposted by XakNet within a few minutes. It is possible this
was a coincidence, but the close timing of the repost could indicate a closer relationship.

and Coordination Center” and announces its operations against Ukraine and Western
supporters

Outlook
Mandiant is continuing to explore the relationship between the respective moderators of
XakNet Team, Infoccentr, and CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn. Identifying the connections
between so-called hacktivists and Russian espionage or attack groups can help victims
assess risk when compromised, allow customers to prepare for the potential leak of their
data, and potentially mitigate some effects. While we assess with moderate confidence that
APT28 at least coordinates with the moderators of at least the three channels we identified in
this report, potentially sharing or driving operations, it is also possible that the GRU or other
Russian Intelligence Services are also coordinating with other self-professed hacktivist
groups to target entities both within and surrounding Ukraine. As we continue to expand our
knowledge of the actors behind recently emerged and longstanding channels such as
KillNet, FromRussiaWithLove (FRWL), DeadNet, Beregini, JokerDNR (alternate spelling:
JokerDPR), and RedHackersAlliance, Mandiant will continue to update our assessment on
associations and drivers behind the actions and activities of these groups.
Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine created unprecedented circumstances for cyber
threat activity. This likely is the first instance in which a major cyber power potentially has
conducted disruptive attacks, espionage, and information operations concurrently with
widespread, kinetic military operations in a conventional war. We have never previously
observed such a volume of cyberattacks, variety of threat actors, and coordination of effort
within the same several months. We assess with high confidence that Russian cyber
espionage and attack operations, while already a serious threat to Ukrainian organizations,
pose an elevated risk to Ukraine as long as Russia continues its invasion.
