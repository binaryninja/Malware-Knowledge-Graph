INTRODUCTION
The computer networks of the United States, including defense, government, and
commercial sectors, are under constant attack and even more frequent probing. Ranging from
denial of service attacks to backdoor-implanting espionage to attempts to bring down critical
infrastructure, these computer network attacks fill a spectrum from juvenile on one end to dire on
the other. Having failed to field an effective comprehensive computer network defense strategy,
some have suggested that the U.S. establish a doctrine of cyber-deterrence as a core component
of such a strategy. Determining the feasibility of cyberdeterrence is of critical importance as the
U.S. prepares to establish a new military command, U.S. Cyber Command, which would be
responsible for carrying out such a doctrine.

This doctrine would vow proportional and

measured cyber attacks against nations attacking U.S. network infrastructure in order to deter
attacks from taking place.1 However, cyber warfare, unlike the nuclear warfare dynamic that
gave birth to our contemporary understanding of deterrence, is dissimilar in ways that make
deterrence a difficult policy and a broader deterrence strategy one potentially destined to fail.
The core problem of cyber warfare is the problem of attribution. Cyber attacks are not
easily attributed.

Attackers can hide in the cloud.

Determined combatants can disguise

themselves as other actors. Conducted properly, the victim never knows the attack is occurring
and may be lucky to discover it years after the fact. Complicating this further, attacks directed
by states need not be conducted by states. Some victims, presented with evidence of attribution,
may not wish to acknowledge attacks for political reasons. In analyzing a series of significant

contemporary cases of cyber attacks, I will show that attribution at a degree required by a
deterrence policy is so difficult that a deterrence strategy is ipso facto infeasible.

DETERRENCE
Deterrence strategy is a framework under which the deterring state, under threat of pain,
demands that the deterred state does not conduct a specific, overt action.

Deterrence is

fundamentally about the maintenance of the status quo on the part of the deterring state, designed
to maintain a specific condition under threat of change by the deterred party. The setting of
demands by the deterring state is generally non-provocative—it consists of, as Thomas Schelling
explains, setting the stage and waiting; in contrast, overt actions on the part of the deterred state
to violate those demands are viewed as provocative.2 Primary to the value of deterrence is the
realization that violence is best utilized when it is threatened but not used, as Schelling
identifies.3 This contrasts with the employment of brute force.
The mechanics of deterrence have been likened to a ―trip wire‖ or ―plate-glass window,‖
as Schelling identifies in his discussion of U.S. troops in Berlin as an empirical example.4 In this
situation, the deterrence calculus identifies the troops as a ―trip wire‖ that, if attacked by the
Soviets or their satellites, would trigger a massive military response on the part of NATO. To
increase the robustness of the deterrent threat, a deterrent state can engage in a commitment
process under which it eliminates possible situations that may give it avenues to avoid enforcing
its deterrence strategy demands upon the deterred state, all in an attempt to make the deterrent
threat more credible.5 Schelling uses the example of Quemoy, but perhaps a better example
would be the ―doomsday machine‖ from the nuclear deterrence satire Dr. Strangelove. By
automating the processes of this machine so that no human could interrupt and prevent universal
global atomic holocaust in the event of an attack on the Soviet Union, the Soviets had achieved

the perfect deterrent by committing themselves to mandatory enforcement of their threat. Of
course, this highlights an obvious issue with deterrence in general, that the deterrent threat has to
be communicated to the enemy and properly understood; an unknown or misinterpreted deterrent
is not a deterrent.
Deterrence is not without its shortcomings. One well-discussed impediment to effective
deterrence is the utilization of salami tactics, an attempt by the deterred state to progressively
and in small steps come close to and or actually violate the demands of the deterring state in a
way that prevents the deterrent from being employed.6 A recent example of salami tactics can be
seen in the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. While Israel made clear to Hezbollah
that it would not tolerate rocket fire on its population centers and the kidnapping of its soldiers,
Hezbollah periodically did both, growing bolder with each operation. The Israeli deterrent was
not used after the first harassing Hezbollah events, reducing its power and credibility. Hassan
Nasrallah stated as such when Israel finally invaded in July 2006 after another provocation; he
had no expectation of an Israeli response7, showing that he had no faith in Israel‘s threat. As
Schelling identified, to be effective the threat has to be credible.8 The deterring party has to
threaten that it will act to prove its commitment; may act is not sufficient.9
Absent from much of the Cold War deterrence literature is the discussion of attribution.
Most writers during this period examined deterrence in the U.S.-Russia framework. Attacks, be
they conventional or nuclear, were always assumed to be attributable. Either the U.S. launched
ballistic missiles first or the Soviets did.

unattributed ICBMs would start raining down upon America. Attribution was so integral to the
analysis of deterrence as a strategy that it was hardly worth a mention.
This issue of attribution, so clear in the Cold War context, becomes muddy and complex
when applied to the realm of cyber warfare. Take a simple policy statement, for example: the
United States will respond with a massive cyber-offensive against China and its interests in the
event of a Chinese attack on the United States or its interests, sufficient in scale as to deter China
from conducting such an attack. Chinese long-range bombers would be detectable flying over
the Pacific, as would ICBMs as they hurtle through space towards San Francisco. But packets
streaming through an undersea fiber optic cable landing at a terrestrial fiber backbone switching
center in Los Angeles, destined to cripple American defenses, power production, or earlywarning radar, would in all likelihood be undetectable. At that moment a prospective American
cyber-deterrence strategy would be impotent. Deaf, dumb, and blind, the U.S. government
would know it had been attacked—but by whom? Who would the U.S. strike back against in
righteous anger?

CYBER ATTACKS AND ATTRIBUTION – CASE STUDY
To illustrate the problem of attribution, I will analyze five contemporary ―cyber attacks,‖
broadly defined. This basket of cases will include attacks against both government and civilian
infrastructure as well as a variety of attack methods ranging from denial of service attacks to
potentially crippling sabotage of critical infrastructure. In each case I will explore a series of
questions:


Who attributed the attack?



At what confidence was the attack attributed?



How was the attack attributed?



How long of a delay was there between attack and attribution?



What was the response of the attack‘s victim?
This set of cases will show the difficulties of attribution of cyber attacks, especially

highlighting the uncomfortably circumstantial nature of cyber-attribution. Throughout these
cases, attribution will be shown often to be technically infeasible, politically undesirable, and in
some cases, both. Due to the lack of published reports of cyber warfare, several of the cases I
examine will not be especially consequential, particularly when presented to a U.S. audience.
The cases available for analysis are few, and those that exist are poorly sourced. But the lessons
learned in these cases I examine are universal, no matter how trivial or significant the
consequences of the attacks.
ESTONIAN CYBER WAR
On 27 April 2007, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet-era World War II
memorial. A lightning rod for the acrimonious division between ethnic Russian and Estonian
6

nationalist elements with Estonian society, its relocation triggered violence on the streets.10 To
many Estonians and the Estonian government, the memorial was a reminder of Soviet occupation
and oppression, while to pro-Russian elements it memorialized those who fought valiantly
against the Nazis.

The move caught the attention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who

condemned the move.11
Estonia is more wired and utilizes the internet more than most countries. Online banking
is extensive and in 2007 a fraction of the votes for parliament were conducted online.12 As a
result of Estonia‘s greater cyber linkages, cyber attacks would have had a significant negative
impact.
A few days before it began, Estonia realized that a cyber attack was coming. Postings on
Russian-language web forums suggested that a major cyber effort was underway. 13 Estonia
refrained from publicly warning Russia as diplomatic efforts were underway to defuse the crisis.
On 26 April 2007 at 10:00 p.m. local time, distributed denial of service attacks began against a
list of Estonian websites.14 Step-by-step instructions allowed any internet user to launch attacks
of their own.15 Public websites and mail servers for a variety of organizations suffered and
began crashing. Supplementing manual efforts, unknown attack coordinators triggered botnets
to begin attacking Estonia, drastically increasing the stream of packets targeting Estonian

infrastructure.16 Websites were defaced and services stopped. The onslaught continued for over
three weeks while Russian authorities did nothing to stop or discourage the attacks. Attacks
peaked on 9 May, which was Victory Day in Russia.17 The political damage outweighed the
actual damage caused by the attacks; slowing internet connections, taking down websites, and
defacing others were more of a nuisance than a threat.
On 17 May Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet directly blamed the Russian
government for direct involvement in the attacks, which he claimed targed Estonian government
websites, telephone networks, and emergency response systems.18 He also directly attributed the
attacks to Russian government infrastructure, claiming that they came from IP addresses and
servers assigned to the Russian government.19 Though appealing for help against a perceived
Russian government onslaught, Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that NATO‘s
collective defense Article V could not be invoked because ―not a single NATO defense minister
would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present.‖20 The Estonian defense
ministry hinted that, in addition to blocking access to Estonian infrastructure from foreign IP
addresses, ―people‖ started to fight against the cyber attack, claiming that ―ways were found to
eliminate the attacker.‖21
Other knowledgeable analysts cast doubts on the veracity of Paet‘s claim.

government computers may have been infected by the botnet used to launch denial of service
attacks.22 Additionally, even if the attacks were overt, they just as easily could have been
committed by anyone, ―from the son of some ministerial janitor upwards.‖23 Hypponen and
others have also claimed that a true Russian government attack would have been far stronger and
lasted much longer, with the results more devastatingly crippling for Estonia. This assumes that
the Russian government wanted to be identified as the culprit; in a cyber war, measured attacks
by proxy deflect blame and attribution when both are unwanted.
Interestingly, nearly two years later, a member of the Russian Duma, Sergei Markov,
explained a possible government hand in the attacks. He claimed that an unnamed assistant of
his coordinated the attacks while residing in one of Russia‘s ―unrecognized republics,‖ possibly
Transnistria.24 While not explicitly coordinated by the Russian government, Markov admitted
that there was passive government support to what he described as ―purely a reaction from civil
society‖ out of a sentiment that ―something bad had to be done to these fascists.‖25
Markov‘s assessment of the situation is the most plausible in retrospect:

patriotic

Russian hackers, with support of individuals acting in a non-governmental capacity but with
passive encouragement from elements of the Russian government, banded together to attack with
criminally-sourced tools like Trojans and botnets.

Not criminal, not state-driven, not

nationalists, not pranksters, but rather a mix of them all were responsible for what has been

termed a ―cyber riot‖ rather than a cyber attack.26 While information released by the Estonians
and analysis by independent investigators suggested this was the case, it was not until this
moment 23 months later that attribution was this clear. Future victims of cyber attacks, however,
cannot rely on the attacker claiming victory as the default method of attribution.
MOONLIGHT MAZE
Long before cyber warfare gained an elevated status and before a Department of Defense
cyber command was a possibility, the Moonlight Maze intrusion set rattled the U.S. defense
establishment. In March 1998, back in a time when cyber warfare was referred to as ―netwar,‖
the U.S. government detected broad intrusions into defense networks, NASA, and other
government agencies. These intrusions, purported to be coming from Russia, were termed
Moonlight Maze by the intelligence community.
James Adams, chairman of a cybersecurity firm and a member of the National Security
Agency Advisory Board, made a splash in May 2001 when he announced the intelligence
community‘s Moonlight Maze investigation in Foreign Affairs.27

Expanding upon the

Government Accountability Office‘s brief mention of Moonlight Maze earlier that year, Adams
claimed that for three years the U.S. government was investigating actions by a ―group of
hackers‖ targeting the Department of Defense, NASA, private universities, research labs, and
government agencies.28

29

Others specifically identified the Department of Defense‘s

unclassified NIPRNET system as the biggest target.30

These hackers were claimed to have targeted information stored on those systems,
including contract details, encryption techniques, and sensitive but unclassified defense
information.31 Covert backdoor tools were installed and specific network traffic was routed to
Russian servers. Adams hinted that the grounds for future sabotage were laid and that many
more questions were left unresolved. Adams claims that the attacks appeared to come from
Russian-registered IP addresses, but no definitive links to a state-sponsored effort could be
found. Dion Stempfley, a former analyst at the Pentagon who helped detect Moonlight Maze,
suggested that the attacks were ―state allowed,‖ in that the Russian government was either
directing or knowingly permitting the attacks.32 Attempts to ―hack-back‖ were limited because
the Pentagon was fearful of conducting an act of war in the even the attacks were coming from a
state program.33 The Russian government was demarched on the issue and pleaded ignorance in
the face of evidence.
Moonlight Maze was one of the first true cyber incidents to target the U.S. defense
establishment. No information has been made public regarding the timeline of attribution. First
detected in March 1998 by computer network analysts at the Department of Defense, Moonlight
Maze may have been going on for years without detection. Even after detection, years of
analysis were required to understand and roughly attribute Moonlight Maze to Russian actors.
Even with the best resources of the U.S. government marshaled to analyze the attacks and
intrusions, no conclusive links could be found to the Russian government or another large,
deterrable actor. The frustrating lessons of Moonlight Maze persist; its story has been replayed
many times in the intervening years as shadowy attackers hiding their tracks have penetrated key

U.S. government systems only to see the U.S. passively monitor and improve defenses.
Moonlight Maze gave the U.S. its first taste of the problem of attribution and the other cases
analyzed here illustrate how the problem is a persistent one.
BRAZILIAN POWER OUTAGES
Possible cyber attacks against power infrastructure in Brazil in 2005 and 2007 may have
caused millions of people to lose power and plunged cities into darkness. The operative word
here is possible; these could have either been two of the most devastating cyber attacks of all
time, with the greatest immediate real-world implications, or they may not have been cyber
attacks at all. Alarmingly, these two cases illustrate both the potential of cyber attacks to do real
harm as well as the tangled web of attribution. While sourcing of details related to these possible
attacks is tenuous at best, available information can provide valuable lessons.
U.S. security and intelligence officials have publicly painted a broad story in which an
unnamed country had cities that suffered cyber attacks that ―plunged entire cities into
darkness.‖34 Tied to off-the-record statements from similar officials, CBS News claimed in
November 2009 that a number of credible sources indicated that cyber attacks were responsible
for two power outages in Brazil. The first occurred north of Rio de Janeiro in January 2005,
cutting power to three cities and leaving tens of thousands without power. 35 The second and
most severe occurred on 26 September 2007 in the state of Espirito Santo, cutting power to more
than three million people, dozens of cities, and a network of plants belonging to an iron ore

producer.36 Their claim, which was rolled into a larger alarmist report on cyber warfare, did not
attribute the attacks nor did it provide a motive. Tied to this incident are statements by CIA
cyber official Tom Donahue, who claimed that the U.S. government had information indicating
that in ―at least one case‖ cyber attacks led to the disruption of power in multiple cities and that
the government had seen multiple examples of cyber intrusions followed by extortion demands.37
The CBS report as well as former Bush administration official Richard Clarke explain that this
unnamed victim was Brazil.38 39
Brazilian officials not only deny that the cyber attacks took place but offer a specific
reason why the blackouts occurred, claiming that physical infrastructure problems unrelated to
cyber infrastructure plunged parts of the country into darkness. In the case of the reported 2007
attack, the power company, Furnas Centrais Elétricas, claimed no knowledge of hackers
accessing their systems.40 They explained following the event that the outages were a result of
soot and dust accumulating on insulators on high-voltage lines.41

Months without rain,

combined with burning fields emitting large quantities of particulate matter, resulted in dirty
insulators that failed to operate properly. Other authorities within Brazil concurred with this
explanation, blaming polluted insulators and fining Furnas $3.27 million for failing to maintain
its transmission towers properly.42

Brazil has had a series of failures in its power distribution and generation systems. Just
days after the CBS report aired, crippling power outages left over 60 million without power and
severely impacted the most populous areas of Brazil as well as all of Paraguay. The blame in
this case was assigned to the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, which provides 20% of Brazil‘s electricity
and 90% of Paraguay‘s.43
The Brazilian cyber or non-cyber case illustrates a new range of issues for attribution.
Chastened commercial infrastructure providers, even in the face of facts, may seek to avoid
blaming failures on cyber attacks. Acknowledging cyber weakness invites more attacks, and,
especially if there are no easy immediate fixes, may lead to costly reforms to improve network
security.

Particularly embarrassing are incidents where cyber attacks benefit from insider

knowledge, as Donahue hinted at in his discussion of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.44
Blaming the weather or a dirty insulator may be more politically and commercially appealing.
Even if cyber attacks are properly attributed, the victim may not want to advertise the
fact. This is not just a problem in the commercial sector, but one for government as well. The
U.S. government rarely discloses penetrations of its systems by the Chinese and Russians; only
once in a while do specific cases like Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze go public. Public
attribution also informs the attacker that the victim is able to detect and discover attack attempts.
Particularly for stealthy state-based intelligence gathering and covert cyber operations, victims
potentially have far more to learn by identifying attack signatures and quietly studying them to
learn attacker methodology, behavior, priorities, and tools. Honeypots, or systems designed to
intentionally lure attackers as a way of learning about them, are particularly useful in these cases.

Victims may also with to withhold attribution as it implies a vulnerability or weakness that they
are unwilling to declare to their domestic constituents.
AURORA
Aurora is the codename given by American computer security firm McAfee to wideranging and alarming cyber attacks by China against dozens of American companies starting in
December 2009. ―Aurora‖ was allegedly part of the file name of the malware tools on a
computer used to attack victims.45 Brazen in scope and technique, the attacks were a watershed
moment for the cybersecurity community, China-U.S. relations, and the future of Google. Most
important in the context of this paper, Aurora has eclipsed the murky problem of attribution as
multiple entities have either openly or backhandedly blamed the Chinese government for the
attacks, with Google going so far as to threaten withdrawing from China altogether in retribution.
The Aurora intrusion set began around mid-December 2009 and lasted until early January
2010, when the redirection servers masking the original attack infrastructure in China were taken
down.46 47 Attackers lured victims into opening emails or visiting websites embedded with
malicious code, a ―zero-day‖ exploit for Microsoft Internet Explorer that allows the attacker to
execute malicious code on the target computer.48 Another attack vector consisted of infected
Adobe PDF files embedded with a Trojan called Trojan.Hydraq, which installed on target

machines as a Windows DLL file.49

Triple-encrypted shell code was deployed to target

computers, triggering them to download further encrypted binaries which unpacked into two
encrypted executable files. These files constituted the backdoor that allowed the computer to
talk back to command and control servers, masking communications in encrypted secure socket
layer (SSL) connections to best blend in with normal web traffic and avoid proxying and filtering
mechanisms.50 Attackers stole commercial accounts on virtual private servers like Rackspace
and Linode, which provide storage and computing solutions in the ―cloud,‖ the anonymous
server farms that provide virtual servers to match any size and power requirements.51 These
servers and others in Taiwan and the U.S. were used as covert exfiltration pathways for data
stolen from target computers. This provided layers of obfuscation for the attackers as in-depth
forensics would be required to follow the multiple hops the encrypted data would take back to
attacker computers in China.
In addition to being advanced in attack vectors, data exfiltration, and source obfuscation,
the Aurora attacks were well-researched and were directed at specific targets with access to key
data. The attacks targeted at least 34 different American firms, many of which had operations in
China.52 53 In all cases, the attackers specifically targeted proprietary intellectual property,
specifically source code. In the case of Google, the attackers also targeted Gmail account servers
for Chinese human rights activists.54 To gain access to this data, the attackers not only targeted

the people involved but also ―swam upstream‖ by targeting individuals within their targets‘
social networks. With compromised email or social networking accounts, the ultimate target
individuals would have no reason to believe that the friends they talked with were in fact hacked
accounts sending attacker malware to key victims.
Adding to the severity and breadth of the attacks, a law firm involved in a U.S. suit
against China for stealing proprietary code for unlicensed use in its ―Green Dam‖ domestic
internet filtering and censorship software claimed it was the victim of similar attacks.55 Gipson,
Hoffman, & Pancione represents CYBERsitter, a software company that builds internet
censoring and filtering software. CYBERsitter had filed a $2.2 billion lawsuit against China for
stealing over 3,000 lines of code from its software for use in its Green Dam Youth Escort
censorship software. Around the same time as the Google attacks the law firm discovered
similar socially engineered attacks against their own employees by hackers seeking access to
proprietary court documents.56
Multiple parties attributed the Aurora attacks, which were first detected in mid-December
and may have begun earlier than that. Security research firm iDefense suggested that the attacks
may have been occurring since July 2009.57 While most attacks hunger for attribution, multiple
companies and security firms independently came to similar conclusions about the attacks.
Google, McAfee, iDefense, Juniper Networks, Adobe Systems, and Rackspace have all
identified themselves as victims of the attacks.

Google publicly called China out in a blog post on 12 January 2010, decrying attacks
―originating from China‖ attacking its corporate infrastructure, stealing intellectual property and
targeting human rights activists.58

Google also conducted its own forensics of the attack,

uncovering similar attacks against internet, finance, technology, media, and chemical companies,
notifying all of the victims of what it discovered.59 Some have indicated that Google ―hacked
back‖ against the servers engaged in command and control of the attack in order to gain valuable
intelligence about the threat.60 Casting a wide net, Google was able to identify that several users
of its email services had their personal computers compromised by attacker malware tied to the
Aurora set.61 Google also linked their experience to other episodes of suspected Chinese state
espionage, including the GhostNet global Chinese-origin spying effort targeting pro-Tibet
activists around the world that was uncovered by Canadian researchers in 2007.62 So enraged
was Google that it announced it would stop filtering searches on its Chinese internet portal and
vowed that it would rather leave China than be forced to infringe on the rights of the Chinese
people.
Despite denying any role in the attacks, China has recently taken action in what it claims
is an independent investigation into hacking organizations. On 8 February 2010 it shut down the
largest hacker training site in China, ―Black Hawk Safety Net,‖ and raided its offices.63 Several
people were arrested and servers and cash were confiscated. This followed a public rebuke in

January by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in a speech on internet freedom that was a
sharp between-the-lines attack on China for its hard-handed grip on internet activity and
repression of internet freedom.64 Blaming hackers for actions that may have been the doing of
the state itself serves dual purposes; it deflects blame from the state while giving China
additional ammunition to justify its totalitarian control of the internet to help weed out hackers
and make it safer for all users.
TITAN RAIN
Beginning in the early 2000s, probably Chinese actors systematically scanned, attacked,
and infiltrated U.S. defense networks. Focusing mostly on the Department of Defense and its
contractors, the attacks also targeted the Departments of State, Energy, and Homeland Security.65
This series of attacks was first disclosed in mid-2005, having gone on for several years before
disclosure.

A parade of unnamed defense officials provided information on background

regarding the case. Opinions ranged from blame of the Chinese government to others who
assessed that at best hackers were using Chinese networks to disguise themselves.
Attackers gained access to unclassified systems on government networks. They pilfered
sensitive but unclassified data from computers, including export-controlled technology. One
analyst who followed the Titan Rain actors claimed that the attackers left behind covert beacons
that allowed them to gain access to systems at a later date, permitting both further data collection
as well as laying the foundations for a future malicious cyber attack.66 According to the few who
would speak in detail about the attacks, the preponderance of evidence pointed to the Chinese

government, as these analysts hacked back against the attackers to map their networks and steal
their tools.
Statements both on and off the record regarding Titan Rain highlight both the difficulties
and the politics of attribution. One unnamed U.S. official asked: ―Is this an orchestrated
campaign by the PRC or just a bunch of disconnected hackers? We just can‘t say at this point.‖67
That attacks originated from China was not sufficient to assign blame to the Chinese
government; the possibility that other actors were using Chinese addresses to mask themselves
prevented definitive assignment of blame. The coached language and sparse details briefed by
senior government officials on background also highlights the desire to keep sensitive details of
the attack a secret. In the original report in the Washington Post that announced Titan Rain to
the world, the author‘s sources made clear that legal and policy considerations, and especially a
―desire to avoid giving any advantage to the hackers‖, prevented them from disclosing more or
making a public claim of attribution.68

LESSONS FOR ATTRIBUTION
Sophisticated attackers take measures to obfuscate their activity, hopping through
multiple nodes and coding stealthy programs to evade detection. Infrastructure from which
attacks are launched are often stolen or hacked themselves, making the job of tying the pointy
end of the cyber spear back to a specific actor often impossible. Chinese attackers nearly got
away with this in the case of Aurora but used sloppy tradecraft and overreached against too many
targets simultaneously. Ultimately they picked the wrong opponent in Google, which was
clearly enraged and not willing to swallow its pride.

Less sophisticated attackers harness

criminal and malicious systems like botnets, worms, Trojans, and viruses to magnify their power
and distribute attack vectors around the world. The organizers of the nebulous efforts against
Estonia utilized this model, turning a symbolic protest into a cyber riot riding on the back of
criminal botnets and scripted attacks for anti-Estonian hackers around the world.

Defense

officials will not likely see naval-inspired line-of-battle attacks with flagged government warcomputers matched up against opponent war-computers in a battle of tactics and wit. Cyber
attacks will emerge from the cloud.
Breaking through the cloud of obfuscation requires significant cyber-sleuthing resources,
potential offensive ―hack-back‖ operations, and most troublesome, time.

Moonlight Maze

highlighted how it may take years of passive monitoring of attacks to piece together enough bits
of circumstantial evidence to tie attacks back to a region or country, let alone to a specific state
actor or criminal element. Conducted properly and with appropriate stealth, attacks may never
be properly diagnosed through passive means alone. Both Aurora and Titan Rain illustrated
how, when combined with the political will to call it as they see it, victims can hack-back in self
defense to crack through the layers of obfuscation protecting attackers. Google and McAfee did
21

not learn the technical, scary details about the Aurora attacks merely by being attacked. They
struck back, spying on the enemy and tracking the data as it was exfiltrated out of their networks.
But even this took time; there was almost a month-long gap between detection of the attacks and
a public announcement of attribution to China. In the event that China were to attack U.S.
defense systems in a far more malicious way, disabling vital systems to cause grave non-virtual
harm to the U.S., waiting a month to forensically swim upstream back to the attacker systems
would not be acceptable.
The case of the potential Brazilian cyber attacks on power infrastructure highlight another
strain of cyber-attribution difficulties: politics. Attribution implies vulnerability. Companies
and governments alike do not like to admit weaknesses, especially weaknesses that they are
unable to fix in the short-term. Admitting weaknesses causes domestic political issues and
especially in the realm of cyber invites malicious actors to take advantage of the announced
weaknesses. If the Brazilian government or the power company were to admit that both outages
were due to cyber attacks, enterprising criminal entities would begin in earnest to gain access to
those systems to hold them hostage for a princely ransom. Additionally, blaming problems on
physical infrastructure and taking a hit with fines may be preferable to re-engineering entire
networks and the costs of increased network security.
Attribution implies a capability to detect and analyze the attacker‘s actions. Stealthy
state-sponsored cyber attack and espionage systems are designed to go unnoticed. Announcing
to the world that the victim has developed the technical capacity to detect and monitor this
activity will trigger a change in operating procedure for the attacker. In some cases, the known
and manageable attack is preferable to the unknown and thus unmanageable attack. This is
likely the case with the Titan Rain intrusion set; its disclosure probably caused much
22

consternation at the Pentagon as it alerted the Chinese that their tools and tricks were being
caught, triggering a change in behavior, tools, and standard operating procedures.
Publicly declaring the identity of the assessed perpetrator of cyber attacks can be
satisfying for investigators. But once the attacks start to dissipate the fears of the unknown grow.
Have the attackers learned from the disclosure how to better hide their attacks? Have they
stopped? Hacking back can be stealthy as well if managed properly; public attribution of attacks
may cripple these efforts to aggressively uncover enemy actions, tools, and intentions.

23

CONCLUSION - IMPLICATIONS FOR DETERRENCE
The set of cases analyzed here demonstrate decisively that attribution of cyber attacks is
technically difficult and often politically unpalatable. Established networking protocols allow
easy spoofing and obfuscation of source, destination, and intent of packets as they stream around
the world. Attribution, as demonstrated in these cases, is often circumstantial at best. While
victims often have strong suspicions of attackers‘ identities built from pieces of intelligence, the
decisions of war and peace involved in a deterrence policy require a higher level of confidence
than a measured hunch. To reach even elementary levels of attribution significant resources,
expertise, and time are required.
The chilling suspicion of the unknown unknowns, the realization that undetected attacks
may be underway at any moment, is potentially paralyzing to any deterrence policy.

A

deterrence policy of ―I will attack you back if you attack me, but only if I find out that you did it‖
is not an appropriate cornerstone of a computer network defense strategy. Without a response,
an attacker can assume that the victim is either unable to detect the attack or, even more
emboldening, the victim is unable or unwilling to make good on its threat. Cyber attacks can be
a powerful part of salami tactics on the part of the attacker. If attacks are unable to generate a
deterrent response in the cyber realm, what other lines can the attacker cross?
Addressing cases where the victim state realizes that it is being attacked, Lt. Gen. Keith
Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, recently proposed that his future U.S.
CYBERCOMMAND would support a deterrence doctrine by attacking back in a proportional

24

and discriminating way against the sources of any cyber attack against the United States.69 He
extended this case specifically to those where the identities of the attackers are unknown.
According to Gen. Alexander, the U.S. will attack back in accordance with the rules of
engagement and in accordance with the principles of proportionality and discrimination, with the
caveat that ―neither proportionality nor discrimination requires that we know who is responsible
before we take defensive action.‖70 With statements like this, Gen. Alexander and others are
providing a strong incentive for enemies of the U.S. to launch cyber attacks on the United States
from third-party territory, hoping to lure the U.S. into conflict with a nation that had no role in or
idea of the attack.
What the cases analyzed in this paper illustrate is that deterrence is a phenomenally poor
choice as a core component in a computer network defense strategy. Bloviation and bluster,
vowing deterrent responses to attacks, make for good sound bites and allow for easy porting of
deep deterrence scholarship to the cyber realm. But less flashy policies and measures are more
effective.

Defense in depth, better security standards for software and hardware, robust

computer network intelligence systems, and information sharing between and among industry
and government are all good and necessary elements of a more successful computer network
defense strategy. Combined with aggressive hack-back defensive measures that work to disrupt
or exploit attacker infrastructure, vital networks will be better defended and deterrence as a
general national policy tool will be better preserved for realms where it is more applicable.
