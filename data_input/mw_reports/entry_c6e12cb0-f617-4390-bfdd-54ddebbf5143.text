Introduction
We are living in a world of incredible modern conveniences.
Computer chips, embedded in all aspects of our daily lives, have
made it possible to have access to all kinds of information when
and where we need it. Through Internet protocols, these once
dumb devices can now communicate with you and with each
other in amazing, unprecedented ways.
According to Ericsson, there will be 50 billion IP-connected devices by 2020, up from 1 billion
just a year ago. These are not just the omnipresent gadgets everyone is familiar with. The bulk of the
50 billion IP devices expected by later this decade will be embedded devices. These are often singlepurpose devices such as cash registers, airport check-in kiosks, medical devices, access card readers,
manufacturing equipment, programmable logic controllers, industrial control systems, and much more
that is now being connected. As history has proven, security is an afterthought for most manufacturers.
All these devices need proper security and management that is built in from day one.
Previously, embedded devices were essentially a one-way information feed—data was sent from the
device from a purely diagnostic perspective (all almost universally out-of-band), but there was no pushing of data in-band. Additionally, these devices typically did very little to influence our lives. Now, policies
and tasks can be pushed onto the device and data captured and reported back to one central console.
And embedded systems have become a part of the very quality of our lives in automobile electronics,
appliances, water and power systems, and the like. This phenomenon has exploded the threat scope for
these devices, and security technologies, such as whitelisting and configuration control, combined with
global threat intelligence gathered from millions of nodes, are becoming more than a nice to have—
they are becoming a “must.” These solutions are the first step toward providing complete security
on embedded systems.
As embedded devices get on the network, security administrators want to know if they have the appropriate level of security. They want to control different policies on those devices through the same console
that they use to control computers.
At McAfee, we are committed to securing embedded devices and the world beyond PCs. As such, we’re
partnering with Wind River and content experts in a variety of fields to analyze the security of embedded
systems and provide sector-specific recommendations for securing these systems and keeping customers,
as well as the general public, safe. This report focuses on embedded systems in automobiles and is the
first in a series of reports on embedded device security. We hope you find it informative and useful.

Embedded Devices in Automobiles
The automobile industry is continually adding features and packages that
add more conveniences and the ability to personalize the driving experience.
Consumers want to be continually connected, even in their cars, which is
motivating automobile manufacturers to add more integration between cars
and personalized devices such as smartphones and tablets.
New cars have the ability to be remotely started
by a mobile phone, using a connection from the
car and a request to start it from the key holder,
through cellular network services or the Internet.
This is just one example of how cars have become
increasingly computerized and connected, both
in the engine compartment and the dashboard
console. As the popularity of these personalized
connected systems increases, so does the need
for security.
Convenience that was once measured by features
like the dual-passenger climate control, heated
seats, or the number of cup holders is now being

delivered not only through good design, but also
through specialized embedded technology. Personalized systems such as Bluetooth, GPS navigation systems, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), and
online help systems have become commonplace.
Automakers distinguish their models through
electronics, and the trend of introducing embedded
microcontrollers and communication capabilities
is on the rise.
These embedded devices are used in almost
all areas of vehicles, including airbags, the radio,
power seats, anti-lock braking system, electronic
stability control, autonomous cruise control, communication system, and in-vehicle communication.

Automakers distinguish their models
through electronics, and the trend of
introducing embedded microcontrollers
and communication capabilities is on
the rise.

Numerous automakers offer cell phone-based
communication, for example, GM’s OnStar, Ford’s
SYNC, BMW’s Assist, Lexus’ Enform, Toyota’s
Safety Connect, and Mercedes’ mbrace. Some
car makers are also including Wi-Fi hot spots in
their vehicles that provide Internet access to the
passengers’ devices.

Today, we’re seeing bold new experiments, including Google’s autopiloted cars and smart roads
with sensors that report on traffic conditions and
vehicle speeds. Experiments like these show the
ongoing possibilities with coordinated, connected
communication from all of the multifaceted systems within the automobile.

What’s interesting is that many of these embedded systems may also coordinate communication
among themselves to bring the next level of
personalization. These include:

But there is a concern that as the industry advances,
there has been little done to ensure the security
of these systems. The first remote keyless entry
systems did not implement any security and were
easily compromised: a regular learning universal
remote control for consumer electronics was able
to record the key signal and replay it at a later time.
And here’s another security lesson from the past—
in the early 1980s, car theft reached a high as car
thieves bypassed the ignition lock by shorting the
electric link to start the engine and drive the car
away. By the late 1980s, cryptographic mechanisms
were implemented to prevent such attacks.

• Unlocking the vehicle with a specific remote key

will automatically adjust the power seats and
mirrors for a given driver
• When traveling at higher speeds, the volume

of an automobile’s sound system automatically
increases so the passenger can continue to
listen clearly
• Based on a specific driver, the automobile can

be throttled to keep the vehicle from driving
over a set speed limit

Car Hacks Exposed
As more and more digital technology is introduced into automobiles, the
threat of malicious software and hardware manipulation increases. There are
many examples of research-based hacks that show the potential threats and
depth of compromise that expose the consumer.
Last year, researchers of the University of California,
San Diego, and the University of Washington demonstrated that critical safety components of a vehicle can be hacked if physical access to the vehicle’s
electronic components inside the passenger cabin
is available. The proof-of-concept software, which
they dubbed “CarShark,” was developed using
homemade software and a standard computer
port. The scientists figured out how to hack into
a modern car using a laptop. Recently, the same
research team extended the scenario to remotely
mount attacks via Bluetooth. This demonstration
supports the need to consider the future security
implications of embedded devices in cars and
conveniences such as mobile phones, GPS,
and Bluetooth.
Another attack was presented by researchers
of the University of South Carolina and Rutgers
University. Modern vehicles are mandatorily
equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are
used within the tires to provide sensor data over
wireless short-distance communication to the
vehicle. The researchers showed that an attack
can be mounted to track a vehicle and compromise passengers’ privacy by tracking the RFID tags
using powerful long-distance readers at around
40 meters. While no actual exploit in the field is
known, and it is not yet understood if and to what
extent this attack poses a threat for passengers’
privacy, it is something that should be monitored.
Going one step further is to combine the CarShark
attack and weaknesses of Bluetooth implementation in cars. Once the attacker guesses the Bluetooth PIN, the attacker could mount the CarShark
attack. Other wireless devices like web-based vehicle-immobilization systems that can remotely disable a car could be manipulated in these situations
as well. The immobilization system is meant to be
a theft deterrent but could be used maliciously to
disable cars belonging to unsuspecting owners.1

Caution: Malware Ahead

“ Making automotive services more secure than comparable
Internet services is really a challenge but is necessary. The
automotive world will also have to harmonize the lifecycles of
IT-security and automotive security components in the car.”
—Winfried Stephan, Senior Consultant
T-Systems ICT Security Consulting and Engineering

There was another recent situation in Texas where
it was reported that 100 vehicles were disabled
from a remote disable system.2 The system had
been installed by the car dealership, however, was
maliciously manipulated by a disgruntled former
employee who remotely disabled the cars and
wreaked havoc by setting off the car horns.
Security concerns stem from embedded systems
integrated into these automobiles and also extend
to aftermarket solutions. Recently, a provider of
aftermarket GPS navigation systems was recording
driver behavior and selling it to Dutch police to use
the data to target speeding vehicles.3

Security testing and white hat hacking are ways
to better understand the possible threat vectors
and emerging exploits. One penetration tester,
hired by a US-based municipal government, determined that several IP addresses used by the city’s
police department connected directly into a Linux
device carried in police cruisers. Using little more
than FTP and telnet commands, he then tapped
into a digital video recorder (DVR) used to record
and stream audio and video captured from gear
mounted on the vehicle’s dashboard. He was able
not only to tap the live feeds coming from the two
separate cameras mounted on the cruiser, but also
to control the hard drive of the DVR.

There are also new tools, like Viper Smart Security,
that use Internet mapping capabilities so owners can track their cars’ whereabouts as well as a
Facebook function that can be configured to send
out instant updates on the car’s activity. This could
easily be used to gain access to the passengers’
whereabouts, schedule, and routine. The security
concern here is not with the automobile itself, but
the correlation between tracking and social media
that opens the question of consumer privacy.
Based on gathering this information via Facebook
updates, the details could be sold or used for
other malicious activity against the individual.

Using default passwords that were hardcoded into
the DVR’s FTP server and disclosed in the support
manuals he found with an Internet search, he was
easily able to upload, download, and delete files
that stored months’ worth of video feeds.4 In this
situation, basic security could have prevented
these results. Gathering the knowledge to hack
into the recording system is one flaw but not
ensuring that strong unique passwords were
changed allowed the ability to manipulate and
delete valuable evidence.

“ Vehicles of all price segments are equipped with
several electronic units, which in the near future, will
boast dramatically increased computing performance and
interfaces. Each interface serves as a motivator and means
for an attacker to access the vehicle. We can expect
new challenges to protecting the changing interface of
embedded systems in cars. Vehicle makers have to solve
the conflict of implementing security mechanism without
losing customers acceptance. I expect a new chapter
of car security in the next two car generations.”
—Stefan Goss, Professor of Automative Technology
Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences

Infotainment and Networking Systems
The infotainment system is attractive for attackers, as it promises to be an
area that closely integrates with an individual’s personalized preferences or data.
When that happens, there is the opportunity for financial gain for the right
information at the right time. Infotainment systems often run standard software
for embedded devices that is widely available, whereas other embedded units
in a vehicle run mainly proprietary or specialized software.
Application stores, Internet access, or remote
connected consumer devices could allow malware
to be downloaded on the in-vehicle infotainment
(IVI) system. IVI software platforms developed for
worldwide use and standards such as GENIVI,5
influence the architectures for better compatibility
and integration. When these software standards
are followed, it becomes increasingly important to
protect against attacks and manipulation. Infotainment systems and cellular connection networks
need to have security designed and incorporated
into the development process.
As the growth of embedded systems and amount
of code continues to grow to support the consumer demand for these systems, manufacturers
now have a model that lets them upgrade or
provide premium functions more readily.

Caution: Malware Ahead

Frost and Sullivan estimates that cars will require
200 million to 300 million lines of software code
in the near future. The increasing feature set,
interconnectedness with other embedded systems,
and cellular networking or Internet connectivity
can also introduce security flaws that may
become exploitable.
A June 2011 article in the San Jose Mercury News
examined the many ways that manufacturers are
using electronics to increase comfort and safety
and to gain a competitive edge. From luxury cars
like BMWs to high-end electric cars like Tesla to
everyday, affordable Fords, automobiles increasingly are coming with Internet-connected features
to inform, entertain, and protect the driver.

“ Security will soon become an enabling technology for
almost all innovations in cars. Most people would rather have
malicious software running on their laptop than inside their
car braking system. Thus, incorporating strong security
solutions will give manufacturers a competitive advantage.”
	­—Professor Christof Paar, University of Bochum,
Germany, and University of Massachusetts Amherst, US

Consumer Considerations
•

Which systems connect to the Internet or
cellular network, and how are they secured?

•

Is there a connection between the navigation system, GPS, and the car’s critical
electric systems?

•

How is the Bluetooth system secured?

•

What amount of personal data is uploaded
to GPS, and is it being stored somewhere?

•

Is there reporting via diagnostics on
the system available to ascertain if it has
been tampered with?

•

Is there any local storage that saves
or pulls information from my connected
“smart” devices?

•

In the event of a resell of the automobile,
is there a way to reset all of the infotainment
and integrated communication systems back
to factory settings to ensure the removal
of personalized settings or data?

•

What is the manufacturer or cellular
network provider’s responsibility in the
event that secured communications have
been compromised?

The New Rules of the Road
The future is not as far away as we think. In June
2011, the Nevada legislature passed a law authorizing executives at the state’s department of motor
vehicles to begin coming up with a set of rules of
the road for autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles.6
Imagine taking a taxi in Las Vegas, and there is no
driver—just a computer at the wheel. This may
be the first step toward getting autonomous cars
on the nation’s roads.
Long gone are the days when the moving parts
were just mechanical. We are now in the age of
computer chips and systems that provide greater
efficiencies in today’s vehicles. Expanding beyond
engine performance, the ever-growing number
of embedded systems and integrated communications in modern automobiles have provided the
convenience and personalization that consumers
crave. But 10 years from now, will these same
systems continue to hold consumer confidence,
or will they quickly become another avenue for
malware and breach of privacy data?
