Carefirst Blue Cross Breach Hits 1.1M
krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/carefirst-blue-cross-breach-hits-1-1m/

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on Wednesday said it had been hit with a data breach
that compromised the personal information on approximately 1.1 million customers. There
are indications that the same attack methods may have been used in this intrusion as with
breaches at Anthem and Premera, incidents that collectively involved data on more than 90
million Americans.
According to a statement CareFirst issued Wednesday,
attackers gained access to names, birth dates, email
addresses and insurance identification numbers. The
company said the database did not include Social
Security or credit card numbers, passwords or medical
information. Nevertheless, CareFirst is offering credit
monitoring and identity theft protection for two years.
Nobody is officially pointing fingers at the parties
thought to be responsible for this latest health industry
breach, but there are clues implicating the same statesponsored actors from China thought to be involved in
the Anthem and Premera attacks.
As I noted in this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware
campaign was erected that mimicked Anthem’s domain names at the time of the breach.
Prior to its official name change at the end of 2014, Anthem was known as Wellpoint.
Security researchers at cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect Inc. had uncovered a series of
subdomains for we11point[dot]com (note the “L’s” in the domain were replaced by the
numeral “1”) — including myhr.we11point[dot]com and hrsolutions.we11point[dot]com.
ThreatConnect also found that the domains were registered in April 2014 (approximately the
time that the Anthem breach began), and that the domains were used in conjunction with
malware designed to mimic a software tool that many organizations commonly use to allow
employees remote access to internal networks.
On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors
and modus operandi to a domain called “prennera[dot]com” (notice the use of the double
“n” there to mimic the letter “m”).
“It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the
Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character
replacement technique by replacing the ‘m’ with two ‘n’ characters within the faux domain,
1/2

the same technique that would be seen five
months later with the we11point[dot]com
command and control infrastructure,”
ThreatConnect observed in a February 2015
blog post.
Turns out, the same bulk registrant in China that
registered the phony Premera and Anthem
domains in April 2014 also registered two
Carefirst look-alike domains —
careflrst[dot]com (the “i” replaced with an “L”)
and caref1rst[dot]com (the “i” replaced with the
number “1”).
Additionally, ThreatConnect has unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on
EmpireB1ue.com (note the “L” replaced with a number “1”), a domain registered April 11,
2014 (the same day as the phony Carefirst domains). EmpireBlue BlueCross BlueShield
was one of the organizations impacted by the Anthem breach.
