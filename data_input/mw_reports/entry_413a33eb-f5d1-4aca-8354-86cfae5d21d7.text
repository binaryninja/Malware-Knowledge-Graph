VSSDestroy is a variant of the Matrix ransomware which targets Windows workstations.
Matrix ransomware was spread via Rig EK as recently as 2017. This paper details the
observations made by the Cylance Threat Research team during their analysis of
VSSDestroy.

Technical Analysis
Our analysis begins with the execution of the malware payload. Upon execution, the
ransomware drops a copy of the malware file to the same directory of the original with the
following filename:
NW[0-9a-zA-Z]{6}.exe
The copy of the malicious file then executes with the"-n" option: (NW[0-9a-zA-Z]{6}.exe -n )
Encryption:
VSSDestroy encrypts files and renames them with the .newrar extension:

The ransomware creates a README document for victims to read after encryption (Figure
2):

Figure 2: Encrypted file and the README document
The document instructs victims to email newrar(at)tuta[.]io or newrar(at)cock[.]lu to
acquire a decryption key. A second avenue for communication, via bitmsg
(hxxps://bitmsg[.]me/), is provided in case targets cannot communicate via email (Figure 3):

VSSDestroy changes the background image of the affected system. The ransomware drops
an image file named 0-9a-zA-Z]{8}.bmp and sets it as the wallpaper (Figure 4). The
malware modifies wallpaper settings in the following system registry locations:

HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\Wallpaper
HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WallpaperStyle
HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\TileWallpaper

Victims will see the wallpaper after Windows reboot.
The Trojan drops a modified version of the Sysinternals tool called “Handle Viewer v4.11”.
The tool closes handles grabbed by running processes, allowing the ransomware to encrypt
them as well (Figure 5):

Figure 5: Handle Viewer [gLxNMqwr.exe]
The modified version is packed with UPX whereas original HashViewer 4.11 is not packed.
If you unpack the modified version, there is only a slight difference between the original
HashViewer 4.11 and the modified unpacked version (Figure 6):

During file encryption, the Trojan sends the infected computer name and any captured
usernames to the C2 server (Figure 7):

Figure 7: HTTP traffic
VSSDestroy searches for remote workstations by running an IP-incremental ARP scan of a
range of networks using NetShareEnum API. If anything is discovered, the malware will
proceed to encrypt the files located on the remote resources:

Removing VSS/Disabling Start-Up Repair
VSSDestroy is designed to schedule a task named DSHCA which runs a bat file
(FcHN8mhB.bat) every five minutes. This process is designed to let the ransomware delete
shadow copies and disable start-up repair after a system reboot

Summary
In testing, CylancePROTECT® detects and blocks both the ransomware file and malicious
scripts.
