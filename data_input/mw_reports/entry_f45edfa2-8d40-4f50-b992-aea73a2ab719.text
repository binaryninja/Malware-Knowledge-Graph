What this talk is not about
• Kerberos, LDAP, AD and all that jazz

Presentation is WIP
• Has been iteratively improved off and on
over ~9 months
• Contains bonus material from directors
cut at the end

https://speakerdeck.com/ropnop/fun-with-ldapkerberos-and-msrpc-in-ad-environments

What this talk is about
• Why a domain joined UNIX box matters
to Enterprise Admins
• How AD based trust relationships on a
UNIX boxes are abused
• How UNIX admins can help mitigate the
worst side effects

•

Background

Threat models should be quite familiar
to anyone securing a heterogeneous
Windows network but…
•

•

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

Uptick in "interesting" UNIX
infrastructures being integrated into
customers' existing AD forests

Perhaps not by a typical UNIX admin
who does not have a strong
background in Windows and AD

Let’s look at specific AD integration
solutions (both open and closed
source) for UNIX systems and
documenting some of the tools, tactics
and procedures that enable attacks on
the forest

•

Specifically…
•

Case studies

•

•

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

We keep running into Vintela
Authentication Services

There’s little or no prior research to
speak of

What about other similar solutions?

•

•

Why does this
matter?

•

•

•

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

Cisco is expected to push the IT
envelope
CSIRT need to keep our AD estate
secure
Security Advisory is expected to give
expert guidance from both a blue and
red team perspective
Talos, ATA et al are expected to
provide cutting edge threat detection

Our customers want to mature their
security posture from a defensive
standpoint

Fundamental truth

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

•

Windows security has
progressed
Linux and UNIX security is still
stuck in the mid 70s
• Reliant on UIDs and GIDs
• Largely applied at file
system

•

Windows 8.1 has…

•
•

•

Restricted admin mode for
RDP

LSA protection
Protected Users security
group
TPM

Windows 10 has…

LSA credential isolation

box and then breach your
domain?”

Thought process

•

•

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

UNIX box and the applications
that run on them often suffer
from technical debt
You submit your AD
credentials to login over SSH
So tell me, what else do you
have access to in Windowsland?
Also, how about other UNIX
systems?

CVE-2018-10832 – Allows

Again we can use “standard”
tools to perform plain text
recovery on processes
• gcore||gdb, strings

•

Abusing stolen tickets requires a bit
more tailored tooling
• Samba’s smbclient & rpcclient

Mimikatz – works from 2014
•

kerberos::clist <ccache> /export – turns UNIX
tickets into .kirbi files

SSH – not usually supported in
practice
• Wireshark – supports loading
keytabs to decrypt traffic
• Xfreerdp – need to evaluate

Similar to Mimikatz

•

•

Capabilities
• Extracts cached hashes
• Scrapes process memory
for plain text credentials
• Locates and steals kerberos
tickets
• Dumps configuration and
other metadata

•

And also…

•

Utilise constant time
comparisons or blinding for
cryptographic comparisons
KDFs are more suitable than

What have we
learnt?

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

Compromising a domain joined
UNIX box could be an easier way
into an AD estate
• Hashes and passwords may not
be well protected on UNIX
• Processes certainly aren’t
• Trust relationships may not be
well understood
• AD on UNIX solutions come with
tools to talk to the domain
controller (and not just using
Kerberos)

•

Always read the manual

•

More research is required!

•

•

Next steps?

•
•

•

© 2017 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Cisco Confidential

Continued research on
Vintela Authentication
Services IPC
POCs for the known Sssd
issues

Continued work with vendors
Focused research on UNIX

Improving Meterpreter postexploitation modules
• No memory dumping
