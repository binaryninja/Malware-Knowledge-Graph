The latest version of our SunburstDomainDecoder (v1.7) can be used to reveal which
endpoint protection applications that are installed on trojanized SolarWinds Orion
deployments. The security application info is extracted from DNS queries for
"avsvmcloud.com" subdomains, which is used by SUNBURST as a beacon and C2 channel.
Here's an example showing that City of Kingston, Ontario, Canada were running Windows
Defender on their trojanized SolarWinds deployment back in June:
C:\> SunburstDomainDecoder.exe < uniq-hostnames.txt | findstr F9A9387F7D252842
F9A9387F7D252842 2020-06-16T00:00:00.0000000Z,
WindowsDefender_RUNNING,WindowsDefender_STOPPED lt5ai41qh5d53qoti3mkmc0
F9A9387F7D252842 on.ca olc62cocacn7u2q22v02eu
F9A9387F7D252842 2020-06-17T00:00:00.0000000Z q94idf4sjbem0rait7gv
F9A9387F7D252842 city.kingston. r1qshoj05ji05ac6eoip02jovt6i2v0c
F9A9387F7D252842 city.kingston.on.ca
The "F9A9387F7D252842" value is the victim's unique SUNBURST GUID. See our blog post
Reassembling Victim Domain Fragments from SUNBURST DNS for more info about how the
GUID value is encoded into the DNS traffic.
You can also run SunburstDomainDecoder in Linux, with help of Mono, like this:
$ mono SunburstDomainDecoder.exe < uniq-hostnames.txt | grep 76330B4D49BF7EC4
76330B4D49BF7EC4 LABELMAR e8fh1ravufms0qpt00gudir2951udivf
>76330B4D49BF7EC4 2020-05-30T12:30:00.0000000Z,
ESET_RUNNING,ESET_STOPPED gp27ssesmvnpkgff7rc0eok
76330B4D49BF7EC4 nde5gaefm oiltaoj08jjd8h12vnr4tur5h
76330B4D49BF7EC4 LABELMARKET.ES
The file "uniq-hostnames.txt" is a publicly available SUNBURST passive DNS repository
created by Bambenek Consulting.
