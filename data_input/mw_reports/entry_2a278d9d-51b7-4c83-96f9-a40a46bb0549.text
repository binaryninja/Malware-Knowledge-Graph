Executive Summary
Over the past seven months, Unit 42 has been investigating a series of attacks we attribute to a
group we have code named “Scarlet Mimic.” The attacks began over four years ago and their
targeting pattern suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about
minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government
source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or
groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these
targets is involved.
The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in
order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment
of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify
which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the fact that the tools Scarlet
Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an active adversary that has been
successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet
Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution
in its tactics.
Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns.
The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high­tech
companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage­focused adversaries are tasked to collect
information from many sources.
The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well
as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic
Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated
attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic
attacks to the PRC.
Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and
India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the
precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described
above.
The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It

was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command
and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade
detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone
significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader”
malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system.
In addition to the FakeM variants, Scarlet Mimic has deployed Trojans that target the Mac OS X and
Android operating systems. We have linked these attacks to Scarlet Mimic through analysis of their
command and control (C2) infrastructure.
To infect individuals with access to the data the actors desire, Scarlet Mimic deploys both spear­
phishing and watering hole (strategic web compromise) attacks. Using these tactics they can directly
target previously identified individuals (spear phishing) as well as unidentified individuals who are
interested in a specific subject (watering hole). In their spear phishing attacks, Scarlet Mimic has
exploited five separate vulnerabilities. However, in many cases they chose to forgo exploiting a
software vulnerability and used self­extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right­to­Left Override
character to mask the true file extension, tricking victims into opening executable files.
As with many other attackers who use spear­phishing to infect victims, Scarlet Mimic makes heavy
use of “decoy” files. These are legitimate documents that contain content relevant to the subject of
the spear phishing e­mail. After the system is infected, the malware displays the decoy document to
trick the user into believing nothing harmful has occurred. These decoy documents allow us to
identify the theme of the spear phishing e­mail and in some cases the target of the attack.
The most recent Scarlet Mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest the
group has a significant interest in both Muslim activists and those interested in critiques of the
Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on their previous targets we
suspect these individuals may be targeted based on the information they posses on activist groups.
The primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire, which analyzes
malware used in attacks across the world. The system also analyzes malware samples collected
through a sharing partnership with other security vendors, including our partners in the Cyber Threat
Alliance. To connect attacks to each other based on malware behavior and command and control
infrastructure, we relied on AutoFocus threat intelligence. AutoFocus users can view all of the files
related to Scarlet Mimic and the malware associated with the group using the following links:

Introduction
The better we can understand the threats to our networks and systems, the more effective we will be
at preventing those threats. The goal of this report is to help network defenders better understand
attacks from a group we have named Scarlet Mimic. This group has been conducting attacks for at
least four years using a backdoor Trojan that has been under active development. The group
primarily deploys spear­phishing e­mails to infect its targets, but was also responsible for a watering
hole (strategic web compromise) attack in 2013.

Attacks from this group have been reported publicly in the past, but mostly as disparate, unconnected
incidents. Based on analysis of the data and malware samples we have collected, Unit 42 believes
the attacks described herein are the work of a group or set of cooperating groups who have a single
mission, collecting information on minority groups who reside in and around northwestern China. In
the past, Scarlet Mimic has primarily targeted individuals who belong to these minority groups as well
as their supporters, but we’ve recently found evidence to indicate the group also targets individuals
working inside government anti­terrorist organizations. We suspect these targets are selected based
on their access to information about the targeted minority groups.
In the following sections we will describe selected attacks we have identified and who their likely
targets are. We will also provide detailed analysis of the latest variants of the malware they deploy
(known as FakeM) as well as other associated tools that allow Scarlet Mimic to target Android and
OS X devices.
Attacks launched by this group were publicly exposed on 2013 in a Trend Micro report about the
FakeM Trojan. Since that reports release, Scarlet Mimic has deployed two additional versions of the
malware. They have also deployed nine separate “loader” Trojans they use to infect systems with
their backdoor.

Attack Details
The majority of attacks we associate with Scarlet Mimic follow the pattern shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: “Spear Phishing with Decoy” Attack Pattern Deployed by Scarlet Mimic
The attacker sends a spear­phishing e­mail with a subject and body content that appeal to the
targeted user. This e­mail carries an attachment, which is typically a document that exploits a
Microsoft Office vulnerability. The attachment uses a file name that is related to the e­mail content to
trick the user into opening it. If the user opens the file and the exploitation is successful, a backdoor
Trojan is installed on the system that gives the attacker access and a decoy document is displayed to

the victim. Decoy documents are typically non­malicious versions of the content the user expected to
see when opening the attachment.
Many of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending e­mail addresses have contact information
on the Internet. The apparent sender email usually appears to be someone associated with the
accompanying text, when appropriate, while the target emails are usually also available online tied to
target organizations. A small subset of the decoys could not be found online and may be from
previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic.
Many attackers deploy this particular pattern, as it is often successful at infecting a user without
alerting the user of the infection. This is the exact same pattern, for example, deployed by the
attackers in Operation Lotus Blossom.
We have identified spear phishing documents from Scarlet Mimic exploiting the following
vulnerabilities.
CVE­2012­0158
CVE­2010­3333
CVE­2010­2883
CVE­2010­2572
CVE­2009­3129
We also know Scarlet Mimic uses a number of toolkits to create documents that contain exploit code
to install the FakeM payload on a compromised system. Unit 42 tracks the toolkits delivering FakeM
under the names MNKit, WingD and Tran Duy Linh. These kits appear to be used by many attack
groups, and they alone are not a good indication of Scarlet Mimic activity.
Additionally, in many cases these threat actors did not use an exploit document at all, rather they sent
self­extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right­to­Left Override character to mask the true file
extension. For example, the following two filenames of SFX archives used to deliver FakeM contain
the RLO character (bolded):
Update about the status of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche’ashes%E2%80%AEcod.scr
tepsiliy mezmun.\xe2\x80\xaetxt.scr
Even when no software vulnerability is exploited, the attacks still typically include a decoy document.
The content of most of the decoy documents appear to be available on the open Internet, and the
attackers typically made small modifications to them.
Many of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending accounts have contact information on the
Internet. The apparent sender email usually appears to be someone associated with the
accompanying text, when appropriate, while the target emails are usually also available online tied to
target organizations. A small subset of the decoys could not be found online and may be from
previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic. The overarching decoy themes were Uyghur­related, anti­
Putin, or Al­Qaeda­related. The decoys are often copied from think tanks or reputable news sources

the targets would likely frequent.
In one instance, the threat actors used content from a New York Times article (Figure 2) on the same
day it was published.

Figure 2: Decoy Text Extracted from the New York Times article
Figure 3 shows one of the more common themes used to target Uyghurs and those interested in
their cause. Multiple attacks used press releases or other content related to the World Uyghur
Congress.

Figure 3: Decoy using World Uyghur Congress Press Release
In July of 2015, we identified a full e­mail uploaded to an antivirus scanning service that carried a
Scarlet Mimic exploit document. In this case (Figure 4) the recipient of the e­mail was an individual
working for the Russian Federal Security Service (fsb.ru). The e­mail body requests help dealing with
threatening phone calls from an international gang.

Another attack, sent to an unknown target carried a decoy image (Figure 5) that compared Russian
President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler.

In yet another case, the threat actors used a conference notification from one organization (Figure
6a) and modified it to appear as thought it was for an “Islamic Country Muslim Religion Conference”

multiple hints to indicate the document was fraudulent (Figure 6c).

Figure 6c: Bottom of the decoy document with replaced email and non­altered date — a quick search
online shows this to be fraudulent
In total we have collected over 40 individual decoy documents used in these attacks, far more than
we can detail here.
We are aware of one case where Scarlet Mimic broke from the spear­phishing pattern described
above. In 2013, the group deployed a watering hole attack, also known as a strategic web
compromise to infect victims with their backdoor. The watering hole is an attack vector that involves
compromising a website that targeted victims are likely to visit in order to infect and gain access to
their systems. According to a blog by Websense, threat actors compromised the Tibetan Alliance of
Chicago’s website to host malicious code that exploited a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE­
2012­4969.) Microsoft patched this vulnerability in September 2012, suggesting that this watering
hole attack used an older vulnerability, which aligns with the threat groups continued use of older
vulnerabilities in their spear­phishing efforts.

Malware Overview
First discussed in January 2013 in a Trend Micro whitepaper, FakeM is a Trojan that uses separate
modules to perform its functionality. FakeM’s functional code is shellcode­based and requires another
Trojan to load it into memory and execute it. There are a variety of different Trojans used to load
FakeM, some of which are more interesting than others. In this section, we will explore the loader
Trojans followed by an analysis of the evolution of FakeM itself. We end this section with a discussion
on tools related to FakeM and used by Scarlet Mimic.
Loader Trojans
FakeM is shellcode­based and therefore requires another Trojan to load FakeM into memory and
execute its functional code. Threat actors have developed many different loading Trojans to load
FakeM, some of which are fairly straightforward while others use very clever techniques to avoid
detection. Unit 42 tracks the following list of loader Trojans that Scarlet Mimic has used to execute
FakeM:
CrypticConvo
SkiBoot
RaidBase
FakeHighFive
PiggyBack
FullThrottle
FakeFish
BrutishCommand
SubtractThis
It appears that the threat actors include the loader Trojans in some sort of builder application that
allows actors to quickly create, configure and deploy payloads to execute FakeM. We believe this
because many samples that execute FakeM have the same exact compilation time but different C2
servers, as seen in the example in Table 1. This suggests the actors compile a single sample and use
a builder tool to configure individual samples on demand.
We used the loader Trojans to provide a general timeline for the development of FakeM samples, as
FakeM is shellcode­based and does not contain any usable timestamps. The timestamps in the
loader Trojans does not necessarily correspond to the usage of FakeM, but plotting the compile
times of the loaders on a timeline shows an interesting trend. The scatter plot timeline in Figure 7
shows the known compilation times of the loader Trojans and the FakeM variant that it executed.

Table 1: Two samples sharing a compile time yet contain different C2 domains in their configurations

Figure 7: Timeline of compilation of loader Trojans associated with FakeM
Based on the timeline, it appears that the actors were actively developing several of the loaders at
the same time from 2009 until the early months of 2014. After the first quarter of 2014, it appears that
the actors abandoned development of the older loaders in favor of FakeFish, BrutishCommand and
SubtractThis. This does not mean that actors will not continue to use the older loaders, but it does
suggest that the actors will continue including the newer or freshly developed loaders in updated
builder applications.
The timeline also presents the possibility that the FakeM developers reacted to the release of Trend
Micro’s FakeM blog and whitepaper. Trend Micro published their analysis of the FakeM Trojan on
January 17, 2013 (marked in Figure 7 by a red line) that discussed the original variant of FakeM.
Shortly after, the original variant of FakeM drops off the timeline in favor of the SSL and Custom SSL
variants. It is possible that the FakeM developers saw their tool was exposed and adapted it to avoid
detection for continued use as a payload in attacks. We cannot be certain if the developers reacted

specifically to Trend Micro’s content, as it is possible that they were reacting to the increased antivirus
detection rate of their tool that resulted from the exposure of the tool. Regardless of the specific
stimulus, the reaction shows that the FakeM threat actors evolved to avoid detection/attribution and
to continue their attack campaigns.
The timeline does have one noticeable outlier, specifically the FakeHighFive sample compiled in
September 2009 that loaded a FakeM SSL sample. We believe this compile time is incorrect, as the
C2 domain for this sample, specifically press.ufoneconference[.]com, was registered by the threat
actor in February 2013. The registration of the C2 domain in February 2013 aligns with other
compilation times of FakeM SSL, which leads us to the conclusion that the September 2009
compilation timestamp was modified and/or inaccurate.
Most of the related loader Trojans, such as CrypticConvo, PiggyBack, FullThrottle, FakeHighFive,
FakeFish and RaidBase do little more than load encrypted FakeM shellcode (either from a PE
resource or embedded data), decrypt it, and execute the resulting shellcode. Other related loading
Trojans, such as SubtractThis, BrutishCommand and SkiBoot employ clever techniques worth
discussing.
SubtractThis
The SubtractThis loader displays a technique that is quite clever. This loader received its name
based on a technique it uses to delay before carrying out its main functionality, specifically by
requiring the user to hit the minus (“­“) key. SubtractThis carries out this technique through the
following steps:
1. Calls LoadAcceleratorsA function to load the virtual key for the minus character “­“. Example:
LoadAcceleratorsA(hInstance, VK_SUBTRACT);
2. Calls SetTimer function to set up a callback function that will be called in the event that the
LB_FINDSTRING Windows message. Example: SetTimer(0, LB_FINDSTRING_, 10000u,
TimerFunc);
3. Creates a continuous loop that starts by calling GetMessageA to obtain Windows messages
4. Calls TranslateAcceleratorA to check Windows message received is VK_SUBTRACT “­“.
5. Calls the callback function set up in the SetTimer function if the user enters the minus “­“ key.
This technique requires user interaction, which makes analysis in sandboxes more difficult.
BrutishCommand
The BrutishCommand loader uses a very interesting method to decrypt the FakeM functional code.
The main function in this loader checks the command line arguments passed to it, and if there are
none present it will obtain a random number between 0­9 and create a new process using the same
executable with this random number as a command line argument.
If the executable has a command line argument, the Trojan subjects the value to a hashing algorithm
and compares the hash to 0x20E3EEBA. If the value matches the static hash, the executable will

Scarlet Mimic: Years­Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists ­ Palo Alto Networks Blog

subject the command line argument to a second algorithm that will produce a value that the Trojan
will use as the decryption key to decrypt the embedded FakeM shellcode. It essentially brute forces
its own decryption key by rerunning itself over and over until it runs with the correct value is provided
on the command line. Unit 42 had not seen this technique used by other malware families and it
introduces a challenging hurdle when attempting to analyze or debug the loader Trojan.
SkiBoot Loader
SkiBoot reads the master boot record (MBR) of the system to determine the XOR key that it will use
to decrypt the FakeM shellcode. It carries out this functionality by calling the ReadFile function to
read 512­bytes from “\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0” and specifically uses the last byte of the MBR as the
encryption key. The last byte of the MBR is “\xAA”, or the second byte of “\x55\xAA”, which is the boot
signature portion of the MBR.
Instead of using ReadFile, one variant of this loader reads the MBR using DeviceIOControl using the
ID_CMD control code, and accesses a specific offset to obtain the value that it will rotate each byte in
the ciphertext within the decryption algorithm. The significance of using DeviceIOControl is that the
VMware hypervisor responds to this API call with a blank buffer instead of the MBR, whereas the
Virtualbox hypervisor returns the MBR correctly. It appears that this loader is specifically using the
DeviceIOControl API function as a VMware detection technique, suggesting that the developers are
well versed in the nuances of the VMware hypervisor and virtual machine evasion.

Evolving FakeM: Variants
Since being originally exposed in 2013, authors of FakeM have continuously made changes to the
FakeM codebase, resulting in multiple variants. Before elaborating on the different variants of FakeM,
there are many similarities that remain throughout the various iterations. The architecture has not
changed during the evolution of FakeM, as a modular framework exists in each variant, as seen in
Figure 8. The FakeM main module is responsible for launching embedded modules, such as a
keylogger or for gathering sensitive files. The main module is also responsible for communicating
with its C2 servers and handling commands issued by the C2 server.

Figure 8: FakeM Architecture
All FakeM variants initiate communications with its C2 server and check the C2’s response for a

command. Also, all FakeM variants share a common command handler with the same capabilities, as
seen in Table 2. The limited command set suggests that FakeM’s functionality is obtained by
additional assembly code provided by the C2 server with the 0x211 command. According to Trend
Micro’s initial analysis on FakeM, threat actors delivered and ran additional code that provided further
capabilities to the Trojan, such as the ability to run shell commands, steal passwords, capture the
screen and upload files.

sleeping for 30 seconds.0x213Sets a flag to end the session with the C2. This will force the Trojan to
reestablish a session with the C2.0x214Exit process.
Table 2: Command handler within all variants of FakeM
Now that we have covered the commonalities between FakeM variants, the following sections will
dive into the specific variants of FakeM. Unit 42 categorizes the different variations of FakeM based
on the method used to communicate with the C2 server, which has changed dramatically over the
years.
Original FakeM
The original variant of FakeM generates network beacons to its C2 server that begin with a 32­byte
header that in most cases is meant to blend into network traffic generated by legitimate applications.
Following this 32­byte header, the original variant of FakeM includes data encrypted using a custom
encryption cipher that uses an XOR key of “YHCRA” and bit rotation between each XOR operation.
The original variant includes the FakeM discovered and published by Trend Micro in 2013, in which
the authors of FakeM first attempted to evade detection of its C2 communications by pretending to
be generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers. Figures 9
and 10 show FakeM attempting to resemble MSN or Yahoo! Messenger traffic, as the first 32­bytes
contain data that resemble legitimate traffic generated by these chat programs.

Scarlet Mimic: Years­Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists ­ Palo Alto Networks Blog

Figure 10: FakeM using fake Yahoo! Messenger for C2 communication
In addition to emulating chat programs, FakeM has also included HTML code within the 32­byte
header. As you can see in Figure 11, the overall structure of the beacon did not change, rather the
only differences is the data in the header contains HTML tags. The HTML data in the header led Unit
42 to a whitepaper published by Malware.lu that suggested the MSN, Yahoo, and HTML versions of
the original variant of FakeM all share a common server application that the threat actors use to build
samples and control infected systems.

Figure 11: FakeM HTML tags in C2 header
In October 2013, FireEye published a blog about a sample of FakeM that did not use fake
messenger or HTML data in the first 32 bytes of the C2 traffic, but instead used four repeating bytes
to fill this portion of the packet, as seen in Figure 12. Unit 42 tracks this under the original variant, as
it uses the same algorithm to encrypt the data and otherwise shares a common structure to the MSN,
Yahoo, and HTML versions with the exception of the modification to the first 32 bytes.

Figure 12: FakeM C2 beacon with four repeating bytes
FakeM SSL
While performing infrastructure analysis on FakeM original variants, we came across shared
infrastructure with domains that hosted C2 servers for malware samples that did not match the
known FakeM communication protocols. Palo Alto Networks WildFire had analyzed many samples
associated with these related C2 domains, all of which communicated with the C2 server using
secure sockets layer (SSL). To determine the malware family that was generating this traffic, Unit 42
analyzed these samples and found that the functional code was the same as the original FakeM
variant.
This discovery indicates the authors of FakeM introduced new code to the Trojan in order to use SSL
to communicate with its C2 server. The drastic change in C2 channel warranted a new variant name,
and we dubbed it “FakeM SSL”. During the analysis of these samples we did not find any operational

13/28

08/02/2016

Scarlet Mimic: Years­Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists ­ Palo Alto Networks Blog

C2 servers to complete a handshake to establish a SSL session. During the handshake, the FakeM
SSL samples will tell the server it supports 36 different cipher suites even though the samples appear
to only support one. Unit 42 believes the cipher suite within the FakeM SSL variants uses Diffie­
Hellman for key exchange and the RC4 cipher to encrypt the C2 communications.
FakeM Custom SSL
In July 2015, Scarlet Mimic delivered a spear­phishing email to a branch of the Russian government
with intentions of installing a payload that was undetected by any antivirus vendors on VirusTotal. The
high profile target and the lack of antivirus detection prompted Unit 42 to perform an in­depth
analysis and found that it is yet another new variant of the FakeM Trojan. We also named this variant
after it’s communication protocol (FakeM Custom SSL.)
This new variant of FakeM shared the same functional code as its predecessors, but again the
communications with the C2 dramatically differed from the other variants. Communications between
this variant and the C2 server leverage what Unit 42 believes is modified SSL code, as the code is
very similar to the FakeM SSL variant. The code appears to use Diffie­Hellman for key exchange and
the RC4 algorithm like FakeM SSL; however, the initial packet sent to the C2 server did not contain a
“client hello” message, which is required to initiate an SSL handshake. Instead, the initial packet sent
data as seen in Figure 13.

Figure 13: Hexdump of FakeM custom SSL variant
This variant of FakeM skips the traditional SSL handshake, which involves an agreement on a cipher
suite to use to encrypt communications. The FakeM code only supports one cipher suite, which
makes the cipher suite agreement portion of the SSL handshake irrelevant. Instead, FakeM creates a
session with its C2 server by exchanging keys. The lack of a valid handshake makes detection of this
C2 stream difficult, as the packets sent between the Trojan and the C2 to establish this session
contain random binary data. Network devices will also be unable to perform any SSL decryption due
to the lack of detection and the inability to determine the cipher suite used to encrypt the data. Figure
14 below provides a visual depiction of the handshake procedure and the subsequent beacon and
command messages.

Figure 14: Communications between system and C2 server, including the key exchange
The handshake starts with a key exchange, which the Trojan initiates by creating a 2048­byte buffer
that it will store its key (128­bytes, followed by null values as seen in Figure 13) and sending its key to
the C2 server. The C2 will respond with its own key (also 128­bytes, followed by null values) that the
Trojan will store and use to encrypt future communications.
Once this key exchange is complete, the Trojan acknowledges the receipt of the server’s key by
sending another 2048­byte packet to the server. To build the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan
creates a 2048­byte buffer filled with null values and copies the string “ws32.dll” to offset 8 and
encrypts the buffer with the server’s key.
After sending the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan will gather local system information and
include it in a beacon to the C2 server. Like the packets sent in the key exchange, the beacon sent
by the Trojan to the C2 server is 2048­bytes in length; however, the system information gathered by
the Trojan is only 296 bytes followed by 1752 are null values to fill the 2048 byte buffer. The system
information follows the 296­byte structure seen below:

The Trojan will encrypt this data using the key provided by the C2 and send it to the server. The
Trojan will then wait for the C2 to respond, which it will decrypt and parse for FakeM commands. Unit
42 has been unable extract any plug­ins from C2 network traffic; however, several FakeM custom
SSL samples contain embedded plug­ins that run without interaction with the C2 server. Also, Unit 42
was able to extract several modules from the original FakeM server application, as seen in Table 3.
All of these modules are shellcode­based plug­ins that would work with the custom SSL variant of
FakeM with little to no modification.

Table 3: Modules extracted from the original FakeM variant’s server application
Related to FakeM Original: CallMe
CallMe is a Trojan designed to run on the Apple OSX operating system. This Trojan was delivered in
targeted attacks on Uyghur activists in 2013 and used infrastructure associated with FakeM.
In February 2013, AlienVault performed analysis on the CallMe Trojan and found that it is based on a
tool called Tiny SHell, an OSX shell tool whose source code is available on the Internet. The Trojan
uses AES to encrypt the communication channel its C2 server, which will provide one of three
commands to carry out activities on the compromised system, as seen in Table 4.
CommandDescription2Put a file on the system from the C2 server. File is saved to a specified
filename in <HOME directory>/downloads/.3Create a reverse shell to interact with the compromised
system.
Table 4: Commands Available in the CallMe OSX Malware
The infrastructure overlap between FakeM and CallMe involves the fully qualified domain name
(FDQN) of “googmail.org”, which was used by both FakeM and CallMe samples. This suggests that
not only do these threat actors have the ability to compromise victims running the Microsoft Windows
operating system, but they can also target individuals running Apple’s OSX as well.
Related to FakeM Custom SSL: Psylo
During infrastructure analysis of FakeM Custom SSL variants, Unit 42 found infrastructure overlaps
between FakeM and another new, previously unreported Trojan that we named “Psylo”. Psylo is a
tool that allows threat actors to upload and download files to and from a compromised system, as
well as execute commands and applications on the system. The name Psylo is an anagram from the
mutex created when initially running this payload, which is ‘hnxlopsyxt’.
Psylo is similar to FakeM in that they are both shellcode­based, and they have similar configurations
and C2 communication channels. As you can see from the following two configuration structures,
Psylo and FakeM have similar configurations with only the array length of the C2 locations being
different.
struct psylo_c2_config {char[60] c2_host_1;char[60] c2_host_2;char[60] c2_host_3;DWORD

Both use SSL to communicate with their C2 servers, and it appears they share common code to carry
out the Diffie Hellman key exchange. We compared the Diffie Hellman code from Psylo with FakeM
custom SSL variant and found that they were very similar, but the FakeM samples had some of the
functionality within sub­functions, which rendered binary diffing between the two Trojans impossible.
Another slight difference involves how Psylo and FakeM generate random numbers for SSL. FakeM
uses QueryPerformanceCounter to create a random number, whereas Psylo uses CryptGenRandom,
both of which generate random numbers 68 bytes long. Interesting enough is that CryptGenRandom
calls RtlGenRandom, which uses QueryPerformanceCounter along with other system attributes to
generate a random number.
When communicating with its C2 server, Psylo will use HTTPS with a unique user­agent of (notice the
lack of a space between “5.0” and “(Windows”):
Mozilla/5.0(Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0
Unit 42 does not consider Psylo another variant of FakeM because Psylo has a command handler
that differs dramatically from FakeM. Table 5 shows the Psylo command handler, which suggests it is
less modular and supports more embedded functionality when compared to FakeM. It is possible that
the threat actors created this Trojan as a standalone alternative to FakeM.

MobileOrder: Mobile Devices the Next Frontier
Another discovery we made while researching this blog is an overlap between Psylo infrastructure
and a Trojan focused on compromising Android mobile devices. Unit 42 tracks this mobile Trojan as
MobileOrder, as the authors specifically refer to commands within the app as orders. The connection
between FakeM, Psylo, and MobileOrder suggest that Scarlet Mimic is now expanding their
espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, which marks a major shift in tactics.
MobileOrder starts by registering itself as device administrator so that a normal user cannot uninstall
it by simply clicking “uninstall” in settings. It will copy an embedded PDF file from “res/raw/rd.pdf” to
SD card “/android/9074ca3f18e201c204ec1d852264bb5432644ba46f54f361a146957.pdf” and
launches the mobile device’s default PDF viewer to display this PDF file, which acts as a decoy
document. After displaying the decoy document, the malicious code runs in background. The
malicious code consists of the following parts:
1. An Android geographical location SDK provided by AMAP.
2. Actor developed code that carries out Trojan’s functionality.
The malware uses the AMAP SDK to get accurate location of infected devices by GPS, mobile
network (such as base stations), WiFi and other information. MobileOrder acts on instructions
provided by its C2 server, which it communicates with over TCP port 3728. All C2 communications
are encrypted with the AES algorithm using a key generated by computing five MD5 hashes starting
with the key “1qazxcvbnm”, and adding a salt value of “.)1/” in each iteration.
The C2 server will respond to requests from MobileOrder with commands that the Trojan refers to as
“orders”. MobileOrder contains a command handler with functionality that provides a fairly robust set
of commands, as seen in Table 6. The first byte of data provided by the C2 server is order number,
which is followed by the encrypted data that needed to carry out the specific order.

Infrastructure Overlap and Related Tools
There is some infrastructure overlap in the C2 servers used by almost all of the FakeM variants, as
well other Trojans such as MobileOrder, Psylo, and CallMe. There are also infrastructure ties
between some FakeM variants and older activity using Trojans such as Elirks, Poison Ivy, and
BiFrost, which were used in attacks as old as 2009. The domain names used to host C2 servers are
a mix of actor­registered and Dynamic DNS (DDNS,) though most are DDNS. The DDNS domains in
turn are linked to a small grouping of ASNs, with one ASN often largely tied to one FakeM variant.
Most of the FakeM MSN C2s resolve to IP addresses associated with ASN 22781 (RBLHST –
Reliablehosting.com). However, we found one MSN sample that shared infrastructure with some
FakeM Custom SSL variants.
There is a similar overlap between FakeM MSN, FakeM HTML, and FakeM SSL. The registrant email
xsldmt@xj163[.]cn was used to register several domains used as C2s: yourturbe[.]org,

Scarlet Mimic: Years­Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists ­ Palo Alto Networks Blog

websurprisemail[.]com and googmail[.]org. One of these domains was also used in the 2013 CallMe
activity at the same time it was being used for FakeM MSN samples. The targeting and decoy style
also matches with the FakeM activity.
There is PE resource overlap between some FakeM MSN samples and some samples of the BiFrost
and Poison Ivy Trojan. This may indicate that the same developer who created the particular BiFrost
and Poison Ivy samples was also involved in developing FakeM MSN. Unit 42 found an overlap
between the RT_VERSION resources, which contains the version information of a Portable
Executable (PE) file, shared amongst the three different Trojans. The shared RT_VERSION resource
(MD5: 55b7a118203a831cc69b37b785015c54) contained the following information:
Comments: Release
CompanyName: Develop Team
FileDescription: Utility Application
FileVersion: 4.0
InternalName: Utility
LegalCopyright: Copyright (C) 2008
LegalTrademarks: DT.Inc
OriginalFilename: Utility.EXE
PrivateBuild: 4.0b
ProductName: Utility Application
ProductVersion: 4.0
The overlap between Elirks, FakeM SSL, Psylo, and MobileOrder exists entirely in their command
and control infrastructure, through domain names and/or IP resolution. Samples of these three used
some of the same C2 domains, notably lenovositegroup[.]com, ufoneconference[.]com, and
websurprisemail[.]com, while some resolution overlap includes 118.193.212[.]12, 210.206.219[.]241,
and 59.188.239[.]117. Similarly, some FakeM Yahoo C2 domains and FakeM Custom SSL C2
domains also have overlapping IP resolutions, notably 95.154.204[.]198.
Scarlet Mimic also uses the infamous HTRAN tool on at least some of their C2 servers. HTRAN is a
proxying tool that allows actors to conceal the true location of their C2 server. Actors will run HTRAN
on a server and configure their malware to interact with that server; however, the actor will configure
HTRAN to forward traffic to another server where the actual C2 server exists. For example, the
[1]

FakeM C2 domain of “muslim.islamhood[.]net” resolved to the IP address 59.188.239.117 during
analysis, but the server responded with the following error message:
[SERVER]connection to 68.71.35.135:8081 error
This error message suggests that the HTRAN application running on 59.188.239.117 was unable to
connect to the real C2 server hosted at 68.71.35.135.

and others, that have documented elements of this threat in the past. In addition to those documents
readers may also find the following publications interesting.
In 2014, Citizen Lab released a paper on threats against civil society that referenced some of these
attacks as the “Domain Name Family” or DNF.
Kaspersky Lab has produced excellent research on attacks against Uyghur and Tibetan activists. In
2013, they identified an Android Trojan that was also targeting these groups. Our analysis indicates
this malware is different from the MobileOrder Trojan described above, but they serve very similar
purposes.
On January 12, 2016, Cylance published a blog linking an exploit document to the group Mandiant
refers to as APT2 and CrowdStrike as “Putter Panda.” While there does appear to be a small overlap
between IP addresses used in attacks from this group and those of Scarlet Mimic, our team has not
concluded that these groups are one in the same.

Conclusion
The information discovered by Unit 42 and shared here indicates Scarlet Mimic is likely a well­funded
and skillfully resourced cyber adversary. Scarlet Mimic has carried out attacks using both spear­
phishing and watering holes since at least 2009 with increasingly advanced malware, and has
deployed malware to attack multiple operating systems and platforms. Despite the apparent technical
acumen, their decoy documents are typically not well crafted regardless of the use of the target’s
language, though they do use timely subject lures.
The primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire, which analyzes
malware used in attacks from around the globe. The system is also fed with malware samples
collected through sharing partnership with other security vendors, including our partners in the Cyber
Threat Alliance. To connect attacks to each other based on malware behavior and command and
control infrastructure, we relied on Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence. AutoFocus users
