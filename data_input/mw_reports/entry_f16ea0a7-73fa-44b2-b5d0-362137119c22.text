Government, Hospitality, Healthcare, Education & Research, and Retail are among the
verticals most targeted on the Coronavirus heatmap.
As the Coronavirus pandemic continues, cybercriminals have started piggybacking news of
the crisis to deliver malware, conduct phishing, and even perform online fraud by preying on
the panic caused by a dearth of medical supplies and reliable information about the
pandemic.
The most recent Bitdefender telemetry shows unusual activity regarding Coronavirusrelated threats: the number of malicious reports related to Coronavirus has increased by
more than 475% in March, compared to February. And we still have about two more weeks
to go until April.
These campaigns were likely mostly targeted at countries that have started suffering an
increase in Coronavirus infections, leveraging the fear on everyone’s mind.
With officials struggling to come up with plans and quarantine procedures, threat actors
seem to have mobilized quickly and started luring victims with the promise of new and
exclusive information on protection procedures.

Malicious Reports Soar in March
From 1,448 malicious reports in February to 8,319 reports until March 16th, the number has
sharply increased, as the real COVID-19 virus spreads aggressively around the world.

Some of the most-targeted verticals seem to be government, retail, hospitality,
transportation and education & research. While it may seem odd, it does make sense that
these verticals are targeted as they actively interact with large groups of individuals and are
most interested in learning more about measures to be taken to prevent a Coronavirus
infection.
Consequently, one reason why cybercriminals have been actively targeting these verticals
with phishing emails impersonating the WHO (World Health Organization), NATO, and even
UNICEF is that employees likely expect official information from known, global
organizations.

A breakdown into which Government institutions seem targeted most reveals that education
ministries, health ministries and departments, and fire services have been attacked most.
In healthcare, hospitals & clinics, pharmaceutical institutions, and distributors of medical
equipment, were mostly targeted, potentially with messages of procedures that need to be
taken, drugs that could work on preventing or treating infection, and even medical supplies
that were allegedly still in stock.

For example, the email above seems to target Healthcare services in Thailand judging from
the title, which is translated from Thai (“Fwd: Re: CoronaVirus Express Information”), and
the name of the attached file (“Ministry of Public Health Corona Virus Information Urgent
2020.gz”). It promises new and exclusive information to medical staff. To make the email
seem more legitimate, it uses the official logos of the Thailand Establishment of National
Institute of Health.

In rough translation, the email (seen above) urges citizens, schools, commissioners and
business owners to follow the instructions in the attached document to stay “safe and free
from the viruses.” It also claims the file contains a list of pharmacies that distribute “a
qualified protective drug.” Needless to say, anyone opening the tainted attachment will be
infected with a Trojan, specifically the NanoBot Trojan.
Education & Research verticals, where messages reached universities, schools, and
technical institute, are all crowded places eagerly awaiting instructions on how to prepare
for the Coronavirus outbreak. They too have been selectively targeted with spearphishing
emails.
A look at some of the tainted documents received by government institutions shows all
filenames, naturally, share the same “coronavirus” string and promise to offer new and
exclusive information regarding the outbreak.
For example, popular document booby traps range from claiming the email attachments are
PDF documents when in fact they’re everything from “.exe” to “.bat” files. That means that,
unless users have the “File name extensions” option ticked in the View menu of File
Explorer; they’ll likely fall for this double extension scam. Of course, the files are laced with
malware and, as soon as they’re executed, they start deploying threats ranging from
LokiBot and HawkEye to Kodiac and NanoBot (see the table below).
Most of these Trojans, including NanoBot, are designed to steal information, such as
usernames and passwords, potentially for use by threat actors either for financial profit or to
gain remote access to accounts, services, and even endpoints.
Below, you can see a table with examples of names for each malicious documents received
by each vertical, along with each email subject (where applicable).

Going After Countries Aggressively Affected by COVID-19
In terms of the geographical distribution for all malicious reports involving the Coronavirus,
things escalated quickly between January and March. In January, reports were coming in
only from some countries such as the United States, China, and Germany. By March,
malicious reports came in from all around the world, and no European country was spared.

In fact, during March, the largest number of malicious reports was registered from countries
such as Italy, the United States, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain,
Canada, Romania, and Thailand. All these countries that have been seriously afflicted by
the COVID-19 outbreak, which is why it’s likely these malware campaigns have been
focusing specifically on these regions.

As if having to deal with the Coronavirus in real life wasn’t enough, threat actors have been
exploiting panic, misinformation, and confusion in an attempt to maximize their efforts in
spreading scams and infections or generally profiting off of everyone’s fears.

Here’s what you should know
With countries straining to find ways to contain and even stop the spread of COVID-19
infections, the average user/citizen is undoubtedly seeking help and information from any
online source on how to stay safe. However, that information may not always come from a
reputable source.
Malware is a dime a dozen and cybercriminals will stop at nothing to trick users into
installing it. It may already be difficult to cope with the real-life virus, and dealing with cyber
“viruses” is probably the last thing on anyone’s mind.
However, just like in real life, good (security) hygiene means you’re not only keeping
yourself safe but you’re also helping those around you. So carefully read through emails to
make sure they’re legitimate, don’t open attachments unless you’re absolutely sure they’re
safe, and try using a security solution that can keep you safe from a wide range of threats,
so you can focus on what matters: keeping your family safe!
