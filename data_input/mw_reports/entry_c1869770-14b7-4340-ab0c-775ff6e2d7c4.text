How are the victims infected?
Malware writers use a variety of technical and social engineering methods to deliver their
files and encourage victims to run them, creating an effective infection vector. Examples
include a fake website that promises to publish censored political information and asks users
to download a plugin to view a video (the plugin contains the malware). Another example
involves the use of spear phishing emails or social network messages to deliver malicious
files using an extension override (e.g. malicious files ending with .fdp.scr would appear
.rcs.pdf).

make it possible that Desert Falcons operations could be nation state sponsored. At present,
though, this cannot be confirmed.

Arab world. It is a symbol of hunting and sharp vision. The Desert Falcons are proficient
