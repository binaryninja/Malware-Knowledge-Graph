Key Insights on Karakurt
We assess with a high degree of confidence that the Karakurt extortion group is
operationally linked to both the Conti and Diavol ransomware groups.
Since its first attacks in August 2021, Karakurt has victimized organizations in a
number of industries and in at least eight countries.
These connections debunk Conti ransomware’s standard pledge to victims that
paying the demanded ransom will keep them safe from future attacks. Paying a
ransom also does not result in Karakurt deleting data.

Summary
Tetra Defense, an Arctic Wolf® company, partnered with Chainalysis to analyze the link
between the Karakurt cyber extortion group to both Conti and Diavol ransomware through
Tetra’s digital forensics and Chainalysis’ blockchain analytics. As recent leaks have revealed,
Conti and Trickbot are complicated operations with sophisticated structures. But, our findings
indicate that web is even wider than originally thought, to include additional exfiltration-only
operations. The web is stickier too as we have confirmed on numerous occasions that the
Karakurt group does not delete victim data and maintains a copy even after an extortion
payment.

Background
In 2021 Tetra Defense was approached by a client who claimed to have been hit with
ransomware re-extortion. They were previously a victim of Conti ransomware and had paid
the demand only to later discover another extortion attempt from an unknown group. Except,
in the second attempt, no encryption occurred. After successfully recovering from the first
intrusion, this client logged in to their systems to find yet another ransom note stating
sensitive data had been stolen and exacting an additional ransom.
The timing was interesting. As Tetra Defense took the case and started examining the
client’s systems, it was clear that the second extortionist had utilized the exact same
backdoor left by the Conti group to access the victim’s network. This was a Cobalt Strike
back door indicating that the second intruder would have needed access to the Conti Cobalt
Strike server in order to use the persistence mechanism. Such access could only be
obtained through some sort of purchase, relationship, or surreptitiously gaining access to
Conti group infrastructure.
This all occurred during a turbulent period in which Conti was struggling with disgruntled
affiliates angry over low pay and leaking sensitive information such as Conti’s playbooks and
training materials. Tetra noted the possibility that this second actor could have been a Conti
operative or affiliate, particularly given their access to the backdoor. Perhaps it was a
disgruntled employee trying to “cut out the middleman” and walk away with more profit by
quietly returning to steal data. Or, alternatively, perhaps this was the trial run of a strategic
diversification authorized by the main group.
Thus began a more regular emergent pattern of data theft extortions. Just a few days later
Tetra Defense encountered the first victim of what was called “Karakurt” employing similar
tradecraft to what was observed in the previous re-extortion attempt just days before. Again,
the victim reported no encryption, only a ransom note indicating that large amounts of
sensitive data had been stolen. This was not unheard of. Other groups such as Marketo
began using the tactic earlier and a few others such as Bl@ckt0r and Bonaci Group were
largely contemporaneous. But Karakurt seemed to outlive each of its competitors in this
nascent exfiltration-only space as Tetra Defense responded to numerous incidents over the
next few months. Our analysis might shed light on Karakurt’s relative longevity.

Who is Karakurt?
Karakurt is branded after the common name of a venomous widow spider, an image the
group does not hesitate to allegorize in describing who they are. As evinced by the excerpt
taken from the group’s dark web leak site, a data theft extortion is compared to a toxic bite.
The antidote? Cooperation, of course.

As opposed to typical ransomware in which the adversary will deny a victim access to data
through encryption, Karakurt is a cybercrime group which infiltrates networks and engages in
extortion by stealing and threatening to release data without any attempt to encrypt. Since its
first observed attacks in August 2021, Karakurt has victimized organizations across a
number of industries and in at least eight countries.[1]

Typically, Karakurt threatens to release victims’ data on a branded dark web site, noted for its
bizarre aesthetic. Until recently, Karakurt posted lists of victim names who chose not to
accede to the group’s demands but is now beginning to make good on threats to release
stolen data.

Conti Hypothesis
In responding to well over a dozen Karakurt incidents to date, Tetra Defense has built a
dataset of intrusions, leading to additional insight. The most ubiquitous point of initial
intrusion for Karakurt attacks are Fortinet SSL VPNs as was also the point of compromise for
the earlier seemingly Conti-related re-extortion.
While Karakurt attacks can vary with respect to tools, some notable overlaps began to
emerge between some Karakurt intrusions and the earlier suspected Conti-related reextortion, including the use of the same tools for exfiltration, a unique adversary choice to
create and leave behind a file listing of exfiltrated data named “file-tree.txt” in the victim’s
environment, as well as the repeated use of the same attacker hostname when remotely
accessing victims’ networks (see table below).
Any single data point is far from a smoking gun but taken together as a series of choices
made by an attacker to accomplish the unique goal of data theft extortion, there is evidence
to make an inference-based assertion that these intrusions could be linked. If the mystery re-

5/11

extortion gang were indeed connected to Conti and likewise related to Karakurt then by
transitive inference this might indicate a connection between Conti and Karakurt.
In addition, Tetra was engaged by another client victimized by a Karakurt attack, only upon
performing forensics analysis did we learn that they had been the prior victim of Ryuk
ransomware in the past. This was the second indication of a potential Conti link, as Ryuk and
Conti are both deployed by the Trickbot Group and exhibit significant technical as well as
financial overlap.[2] Armed with a hypothesis that something more systemic was occurring,
Tetra Defense collaborated with our intel partners at Chainalysis.

Conti and Karakurt’s Financial Connections
In partnership with Chainalysis and its world-class blockchain analysis team, we can analyze
cryptocurrency transactions carried out by Conti and Karakurt to reveal financial connections
between the two. Blockchain analysis provided some of the earliest indication of Karakurt’s
ties to Conti ransomware, as the relevant transactions pre-date the discovery of the
similarities in Karakurt and Conti’s software and attack strategy.
Chainalysis has identified dozens of cryptocurrency addresses belonging to Karakurt,
scattered across multiple wallets. Victim payments to those addresses range from $45,000 to
$1 million worth of cryptocurrency. Right off the bat, we can see examples of Karakurt wallets
sending substantial sums of cryptocurrency to Conti wallets.

6/11

For example, in the Chainalysis Reactor screenshot above, we see a Karakurt extortion
wallet moving 11.36 Bitcoin — worth approximately $472,000 at the time of transfer — to a
Conti wallet. But the connections run even deeper. Chainalysis has also found that several
Karakurt victim payment addresses are hosted by wallets that also house Conti victim
payment addresses.

Shared wallet hosting leaves virtually no doubt that Conti and Karakurt are deployed by the
same individual or group.
How Diavol Fits
Tetra has discovered some oversights by Karakurt operatives which reveal a connection to
Diavol ransomware, another group which emerged around the same time (July 2021) and
has been associated with Trickbot.[3] Tetra responders observed adversary actions across
multiple cases which proved shared use of tools and infrastructure, though, like Conti, Diavol
employs encryption whereas Karakurt does not.

7/11

Diavol, Conti, and Ryuk had been reported using the same malware loader[4] and the Conti
Jabber chat leaks in Feb – March 2022 further revealed the nature of the connection with
Diavol.[5] In the chats, Stern (the Trickbot Group administrator and Conti manager) wrote to
Mango (the people manager) in early July 2021 to inform that Baget, another operative, had
completed the Diavol locker and that it had come back clean on antivirus detection tests.
Both Karakurt and Diavol sprang from within the heart of Conti and Tetra Defense was able
to confirm that Karakurt and Diavol operators were sharing attacker infrastructure during the
same period of time.
Once again though, blockchain analysis confirms Diavol’s connection to Karakurt and Conti.
Similar to Karakurt, the Reactor graph below shows a Diavol extortion address hosted by a
wallet containing addresses used in Conti ransomware attacks.

Again, this common address ownership confirms with near total certainty that Diavol is
deployed by the same actors behind Conti and Karakurt.
Karakurt may be Conti’s diversification strategy, but not a wise one
We have been able to demonstrate relatively high-confidence connections between Conti,
Karakurt, and Diavol. However Karakurt is being run, it no doubt gains some advantage with
access to Conti resources such as access to victims or the tools and infrastructure used by
the rest of the group. Knowing who you are dealing with in the fight against ransomware is a

8/11

rare opportunity, which helps defenders know how to respond. Through collaborative efforts
in Tetra’s forensic investigations with Chainalysis’ blockchain analytics and IR partners, there
is a strong case to be made that Karakurt and Diavol are part of the evolving Conti web.
Why might Conti deploy a quasi-ransomware strain like Karakurt? The Conti Leaks may hold
the answer. Chats between Trickbot Group managers show that they’ve thought long and
hard about how to diversify their business model, with some proposing ideas like selling
exfiltrated data or access to victims. Operating multiple ransomware strains could also be a
way to enhance resiliency and enable business continuity amid any possible government
actions. Amid unprecedented Law Enforcement action on ransomware in 2021 when
Karakurt emerged, Conti managers may have perceived that launching a strain that does not
encrypt can bypass scrutiny incurred by “ransomware” while still achieving financial
objectives.
Whether Karakurt is an elaborate side hustle by Conti and Diavol operatives or whether this
is an enterprise sanctioned by the overall organization remains to be seen. What we can say
is this connection perhaps explains why Karakurt is surviving and thriving despite some of its
exfiltration-only competitors dying out.
But in the long run, the strategy may backfire, as these discoveries discredit Conti
ransomware’s standard pledge to victims that paying the demanded ransom will keep them
safe from future attacks and result in the criminal enterprise keeping its word. We have been
able to confirm on numerous occasions that the Karakurt group does not delete victim data
after payment and maintains a copy. However, the motivation behind this is unclear. While
we have not as yet observed re-extortion after a Karakurt payment, the victim’s deal is only
partially honored. In addition, there is plausible evidence to assert that Conti has used
Karakurt against former victims.

Check out the highlighted portion of the Conti ransom note above. Ransomware attacks are
premised on the victim’s trust that their payment will end the attack and return to them control
of their data. If victims and their incident response firms know Conti may have re-extorted
prior victims using Karakurt and that data won’t actually be deleted, there’s much less
incentive to pay. Don’t get caught in the web.
