In the previous blog post, the AhnLab ASEC analysis team has mentioned malware that is
searched through keywords such as cracks and serials of commercial software, urging users
to take caution.
Various Types of Threats Disguised as Software Download Being Distributed
While investigating a recent breach case of the internal network of a certain company, the
team has discovered that the company was infected with Redline Stealer disguised as a
crack for commercial software and had its VPN website and account credentials leaked.
The company where the damage occurred provided VPN service to employees who were
working from home to give access to the company’s internal network, and the employees
connected to the VPN on the provided laptops or their PCs. The targeted employee used the
password management feature provided by the web browser to save and use the account
and password for the VPN website on the web browser. While doing so, the PC was infected
with malware targeting account credentials, leaking accounts and passwords of various
websites, which also included the VPN account of the company.

The system that had the account credentials leaked is the employee’s PC, which is also
used by the employee’s family members for other purposes. One of the family members
searched for SoundShifter, a pitch-shifting program from Waves, with the keywords free and
crack. The user then downloaded waves_60e87ffe7200b.zip file, which had a malicious file
included, then executed the malicious and system was infected.

The team has discovered the search history of the keywords waves soundshifter free and
waves soundshifter crack from the web browser history.

Searching the keywords on Google shows various download websites on the search results.

It seems that the user visited multiple pages shown on the search result.

There was also a trace of file download. As the process for visiting the download page was
not confirmed, it appears that the user manually accessed the malicious page shown on the
search results. However, current search result does not show whether it is possible to do so.

The downloaded file is a compressed file that contains an encrypted compressed file and a
TXT file that has the password for decompression. Such a method is used by attackers to
bypass anti-malware detection that is run when the file is downloaded.

structure of downloaded compressed file (waves_60e87ffe7200b.zip)
As the user downloaded the file to install the software, the user would have read and
followed the description written on TXT file, decompressing the encrypted file and executing
the malicious file disguised as an installer. The decompressed installer has multiple
malicious files inside. When it is installed, malicious files such as Danabot, Redline Stealer,
and Vidar are created in the system. Analyzing the malicious files found in the system and
related artifacts such as file path and file name showed that there were other nearly identical
files distributed during a similar period.
Such cases also had malicious files disguised as installers of illegal software such as cracks
or keygens that were distributed by being uploaded on file-sharing websites. Among similar
malicious files we found, the analysis result and many behaviors (folder path of a malicious
file created in the personal PC, folder name, naming rules of a malicious file, file creation
order, etc.) of the malicious file distributed in the Keygen sharing website (topkeygen.com)
on June 2021 match those of the file discussed in this post.
The following figure shows a similarity of the location that the file is created.

and malicious file distributed in topkeygen
After the malicious file was executed, the breached personal PC had traces of suspicious
files being run such as cio.exe.com, orrore.exe.com, and certe.exe.com. But they could not
be secured as they were deleted after being run. Considering that the traces discovered in
the system are similar to those of the system infected with Redline Stealer type, it seems that
the malicious files all fall into the same category.

Name of malicious file (cio.exe.com)
Using double file extensions (.exe.com)
Scanning and collecting web browser credentials (Chrome, Login Data of Edge
browser, Cookies, and Web Data)
As for scanning web browser credentials, Microsoft Windows Defender’s log file MPLog
detected a trace of the Login Data file recorded with account names and password of the
web browser being scanned by Orrore.exe.com on July 10th.

The account credentials saved on the website were leaked by Redline Stealer, and the list of
accounts that were leaked includes the VPN website of the company and account &
password credentials.

The leaked account was used to breach the internal network of the company several months
later.
[IOC Info]
Traces of what is judged to be Redline Stealer were discovered in the breached system, and
the Hash of the malware could not be obtained as the malicious files have been deleted.
