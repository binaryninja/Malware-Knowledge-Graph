Sodinokibi (aka REvil) is available in the underground market as a Ransomware-as-aService model, the gang behind the Sodinokibi ransomware has been very active in the US
in recent months, in December, CyrusOne, one of the major US data center provider, was hit
by the same ransomware. In January, Synoptek, a California-based IT service provider
decided to pay the ransom to decrypt its files after being infected with the Sodinokibi
ransomware.
Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. is an American fashion house founded in 1982 by Kenneth
Cole.
The Sodinokibi ransomware operators claim to have stolen over 70,000 documents with
financial and work data, and more than 60,000 records of company customers.
The Sodinokibi gang requested the payment of a ransom and threatens to leak online the full
dump containing stolen data in case the company will decide to not meet the request.
“Kenneth Cole Productions, you have to hurry,” the ransomware operators said. “When time
is up and there is no feedback from you, the entire cloud data will be published, including
your customers’ personal data.”

In December, for the first time, the crime gang behind the Maze ransomware, decided to
blackmail the victims and force them to pay the ransom.
This move is shocking and brings the ransomware attack to a higher level of threat, we can
expect that other cybercrime gangs will adopt a similar strategy to blackmail the victims and
force them to pay the ransom.
Other groups, such as the Nemty Ransomware and BitPyLock gangs adopted the same
technique in January 2020.
