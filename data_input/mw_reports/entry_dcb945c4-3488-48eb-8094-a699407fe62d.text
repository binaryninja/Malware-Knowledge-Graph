Threat Analysis Group

Google’s Threat Analysis Group tracks actors involved in disinformation campaigns,
government backed hacking, and financially motivated abuse. Since late 2019, our team has
disrupted financially motivated phishing campaigns targeting YouTubers with Cookie Theft
malware.
The actors behind this campaign, which we attribute to a group of hackers recruited in a
Russian-speaking forum, lure their target with fake collaboration opportunities (typically a
demo for anti-virus software, VPN, music players, photo editing or online games), hijack their
channel, then either sell it to the highest bidder or use it to broadcast cryptocurrency scams.
In collaboration with YouTube, Gmail, Trust & Safety, CyberCrime Investigation Group and
Safe Browsing teams, our protections have decreased the volume of related phishing emails
on Gmail by 99.6% since May 2021. We blocked 1.6M messages to targets, displayed ~62K
Safe Browsing phishing page warnings, blocked 2.4K files, and successfully restored ~4K
accounts. With increased detection efforts, we’ve observed attackers shifting away from
Gmail to other email providers (mostly email.cz, seznam.cz, post.cz and aol.com). Moreover,
to protect our users, we have referred the below activity to the FBI for further investigation.
In this blog, we share examples of the specific tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
used to lure victims, as well as some guidance on how users can further protect themselves.

Tactics, techniques and procedures
Cookie Theft, also known as “pass-the-cookie attack,” is a session hijacking technique that
enables access to user accounts with session cookies stored in the browser. While the
technique has been around for decades, its resurgence as a top security risk could be due to
a wider adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) making it difficult to conduct abuse, and
shifting attacker focus to social engineering tactics.

Social engineering YouTubers with advertisement offer
Many YouTube creators provide an email address on their channel for business
opportunities. In this case, the attackers sent forged business emails impersonating an
existing company requesting a video advertisement collaboration.

Example phishing email message
The phishing typically started with a customized email introducing the company and its
products. Once the target agreed to the deal, a malware landing page disguised as a
software download URL was sent via email or a PDF on Google Drive, and in a few cases,
Google documents containing the phishing links. Around 15,000 actor accounts were
identified, most of which were created for this campaign specifically.

Fake software landing pages and social media accounts
The attackers registered various domains associated with forged companies and built
multiple websites for malware delivery. To date, we’ve identified at least 1,011 domains
created solely for this purpose. Some of the websites impersonated legitimate software sites,
such as Luminar, Cisco VPN, games on Steam, and some were generated using online
templates. During the pandemic, we also uncovered attackers posing as news providers with
a “Covid19 news software.”

In one case, we observed a fake social media page copying content from an existing
software company. The following screenshot is an example of a fake page where the original
URL is replaced with one leading to a cookie theft malware download.

Because Google actively detects and disrupts phishing links sent via Gmail, the actors were
observed driving targets to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.

Delivering cookie theft malware
Once the target runs the fake software, a cookie stealing malware executes, taking browser
cookies from the victim’s machine and uploading them to the actor's command & control
servers. Although this type of malware can be configured to be persistent on the victim's
machine, these actors are running all malware in non-persistent mode as a smash-and-grab
technique. This is because if the malicious file is not detected when executed, there are less
artifacts on an infected host and therefore security products fail to notify the user of a past
compromise.
We have observed that actors use various types of malware based on personal preference,
most of which are easily available on Github. Some commodity malware used included
RedLine, Vidar, Predator The Thief, Nexus stealer, Azorult, Raccoon, Grand Stealer, Vikro
Stealer, Masad (Google’s naming), and Kantal (Google’s naming) which shares code
similarity with Vidar. Open source malware like Sorano and AdamantiumThief were also
observed. Related hashes are listed in the Technical Details section, at the end of this report.
Most of the observed malware was capable of stealing both user passwords and cookies.
Some of the samples employed several anti-sandboxing techniques including enlarged files,
encrypted archive and download IP cloaking. A few were observed displaying a fake error
message requiring user click-through to continue execution.

Cryptocurrency scams and channel selling
A large number of hijacked channels were rebranded for cryptocurrency scam livestreaming. The channel name, profile picture and content were all replaced with
cryptocurrency branding to impersonate large tech or cryptocurrency exchange firms. The
attacker live-streamed videos promising cryptocurrency giveaways in exchange for an initial
contribution.
On account-trading markets, hijacked channels ranged from $3 USD to $4,000 USD
depending on the number of subscribers.

Hack-for-Hire attackers
These campaigns were carried out by a number of hack-for-hire actors recruited on Russianspeaking forums via the following job description, offering two types of work:

This recruitment model explains the highly customized social engineering, as well as the
varied malware types given each actor's choice of preferred malware.

Protecting our users from attacks
We are continuously improving our detection methods and investing in new tools and
features that automatically identify and stop threats like this one. Some of these
improvements include:
Additional heuristic rules to detect and block phishing & social engineering emails,
cookie theft hijacking and crypto-scam livestreams.
Safe Browsing is further detecting and blocking malware landing pages and
downloads.
YouTube has hardened channel transfer workflows, detected and auto-recovered over
99% of hijacked channels.
Account Security has hardened authentication workflows to block and notify the user
on potential sensitive actions.

5/8

Sensitive action blocked in account
It is also important that users remain aware of these types of threats and take appropriate
action to further protect themselves. Our recommendations:
Take Safe Browsing warnings seriously. To avoid malware triggering antivirus
detections, threat actors social engineer users into turning off or ignoring warnings.
Before running software, perform virus scanning using an antivirus or online virus
scanning tool like VirusTotal to verify file legitimacy.
Enable the “Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection” mode in your Chrome browser,
a feature that increases warnings on potentially suspicious web pages & files.
Be aware of encrypted archives which are often bypassing antivirus detection scans,
increasing the risk of running malicious files.

6/8

Protect your account with 2-Step-verification (multi-factor authentication) which
provides an extra layer of security to your account in case your password is stolen.
Starting November 1, monetizing YouTube creators must turn on 2-Step Verification on
the Google Account used for their YouTube channel to access YouTube Studio or
YouTube Studio Content Manager.
