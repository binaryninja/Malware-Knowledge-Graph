FOREWORD
The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) system is prescribed by MIL-STD 3007 and provides
planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria, and applies
to the Military Departments, the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field Activities in accordance
with USD (AT&L) Memorandum dated 29 May 2002. UFC will be used for all DoD projects and
work for other customers where appropriate. All construction outside of the United States is
also governed by Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Host Nation Funded Construction
Agreements (HNFA), and in some instances, Bilateral Infrastructure Agreements (BIA.)
Therefore, the acquisition team must ensure compliance with the most stringent of the UFC, the
SOFA, the HNFA, and the BIA, as applicable.
UFC are living documents and will be periodically reviewed, updated, and made available to
users as part of the Services’ responsibility for providing technical criteria for military
construction. Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE), Naval Facilities
Engineering Command (NAVFAC), and Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) are
responsible for administration of the UFC system. Defense agencies should contact the
preparing service for document interpretation and improvements. Technical content of UFC is
the responsibility of the cognizant DoD working group. Recommended changes with supporting
rationale should be sent to the respective service proponent office by the following electronic
form: Criteria Change Request. The form is also accessible from the Internet sites listed below.
UFC are effective upon issuance and are distributed only in electronic media from the following
source:
• Whole Building Design Guide web site http://dod.wbdg.org/.
Hard copies of UFC printed from electronic media should be checked against the current
electronic version prior to use to ensure that they are current.

UNIFIED FACILITIES CRITERIA (UFC)
NEW DOCUMENT SUMMARY SHEET
Document: UFC 4-010-06, Cybersecurity of Facility-Related Control Systems
Superseding: None
Description: UFC 4-010-06 provides requirements for incorporating cybersecurity into
the design of facility-related control systems.
Justification: DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity requires the implementation of a “multiLeveled cybersecurity risk management process… as described in National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-39 and the Committee
on National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy 22.” It further requires the use of NIST SP
800-37, and a transition to CNSSI No. 1253 and NIST SP 800-53. For control systems,
NIST SP 800-82 R2 Appendix G is used as the overlay under CNSSI No. 1253.
This UFC provides criteria for the inclusion of cybersecurity in the design of control
systems in order to address appropriate Risk Management Framework (RMF) security
controls during design and subsequent construction.
Impact: While the inclusion of cybersecurity during the design and construction of
control systems will increase the cost of both design and construction, it is more costeffective to implement these security controls starting at design than to implement them
on a designed and installed system. Historically, control systems have not included
these cybersecurity requirements, so the addition of these cybersecurity requirements
will increase both cost and security. The increase in cost will be lower than the increase
in cost of applying these requirements after design.
Note: This UFC is based on NIST SP 800-53 R4 and NIST SP 800-82 R2. As new
versions of NIST publications are issued, guidance will be posted on the RMF
Knowledge Service (https://rmfks.osd.mil) and will be included in updates to this UFC.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1-1

BACKGROUND.

A control system (CS) typically consists of networked digital controllers and a user
interface which are used to monitor, and generally also to control equipment. There are
many types of control systems ranging from building control systems to manufacturing
control systems to weapon control systems, all with different names and terminology.
Facility-related control systems are a subset of control systems that are used to monitor
and control equipment and systems related to DoD real property facilities (e.g., building
control systems, utility control systems, electronic security systems, and fire and life
safety systems).
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) is the DoD process for applying cybersecurity
to information technology (IT), including control systems. The RMF categorizes
systems by the impact the system can have on organizational mission using HIGH,
MODERATE, and LOW impact levels. The RMF is further described in CHAPTER 2
and APPENDIX C.
1-2

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.

This UFC describes requirements for incorporating cybersecurity in the design of all
facility-related control systems. It defines a process based on the Risk Management
Framework suitable for control systems of any impact rating, and provides specific
guidance suitable for control systems assigned LOW or MODERATE impact level.
1-3

APPLICABILITY.

This UFC applies to all planning, design and construction, renovation, and repair of new
and existing facilities and installations that result in DoD real property assets, regardless
of funding source. MODERATE and HIGH impact systems generally require more
expertise and attention to detail than a UFC can provide. Design of MODERATE or
HIGH impact systems will typically require additional customized requirements to
achieve appropriate levels of cybersecurity and design of such systems should be
coordinated with the points of contact provided in Paragraph 1-6.
In defining specific requirements for LOW or MODERATE systems, this UFC assumes
the control system is being implemented on a DoD Installation. Systems not being
implemented on a DoD Installation will require modifications to the requirements
included in this UFC.
1-4

GENERAL BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.

Comply with UFC 1-200-01, DoD Building Code (General Building Requirements). UFC
1-200-01 provides applicability of model building codes and government unique criteria
for typical design disciplines and building systems, as well as for accessibility,
antiterrorism, security, high performance and sustainability requirements, and safety.
Use this UFC in addition to UFC 1-200-01 and the UFCs and government criteria
referenced therein.

ORGANIZATION.

CHAPTER 2 provides an overview of the RMF as it applies to control systems, control
system architecture and the cybersecurity approach to control systems. CHAPTER 3
defines a 5-step approach to incorporating cybersecurity into the design of control
systems. CHAPTER 4 defines minimum design requirements for control systems to be
implemented in addition to the specific requirements identified through the 5-step
process described in CHAPTER 3. CHAPTER 5 defines the submittal requirements for
documenting cybersecurity aspects of control system design.
APPENDIX C provides an overview of the Risk Management Framework as it pertains
to control systems. 0 provides additional detail on the Platform Enclave concept.
APPENDIX E describes the 5-Level architecture for control systems. APPENDIX F
discusses considerations in the integration of critical building systems into a non-critical
UMCS. 0 provides guidance for security control families, and individual security
controls. APPENDIX H categorizes CCIs by impact and responsibility.

CHAPTER 2 CONTROL SYSTEM CYBERSECURITY OVERVIEW
2-1

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW.

A summary of key aspects of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as it applies to
control system design is provided here. APPENDIX C contains a more extensive
summary of the RMF as it relates to this UFC. It is highly recommended that readers
unfamiliar with the RMF review APPENDIX C before incorporating cybersecurity
requirements into control system design.
2-1.1

Security Controls.

The RMF relies on the implementation of security controls, where a control is a specific
action taken to secure a system. Note that this usage of the word ‘control’ is different
from control engineering or control systems engineering, which is the engineering
discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. To
provide clarity of usage, this UFC will use the term “security control” to refer to
cybersecurity controls.
2-1.2

RMF Goal.

The goal of the RMF is to reduce and mitigate vulnerabilities until the risk is acceptable
to the System Owner (SO) and Authorizing Official (AO). Under the RMF, risk reduction
is not "all or nothing", rather the security solution must reduce risk while considering the
constraints of resources and mission requirements. For application of the RMF to
control systems, the determination of cybersecurity risk reduction must also account for
any additional risks to system functionality due to application of the security controls.
The decision of whether a level of risk is acceptable is made by the assigned
government AO. The designer provides input into the risk analysis process by advising
on the impact, or lack thereof, of applying security controls to the control system.
2-1.3

Platform Information Technology.

DoD Instructions 8500.01 and 8510.01 define the Risk Management Framework (RMF)
for the DoD and establish a category for “special purpose” systems that are not
traditional information technology or information systems, called Platform Information
Technology (PIT) systems. These PIT systems, including control systems, use
specifically tailored security controls sets and require the AO to have expertise in the
system.
The selection of the set of security controls to implement for a given system is the
responsibility of the AO. The designer provides input into security control selection by
advising on the feasibility and potential impacts of applying a security control.

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
2-1.4

Inherited Security Controls.

An inherited security control is a security control that a system meets by virtue of
someone else addressing it in such a way that it applies to the system. A control
system will generally inherit security controls one of three ways: by existing within a
physical security boundary, by being covered by policies and procedures already in
place, or by connection to another system which addresses the security controls.
Since inheritance often requires the SO to coordinate with others, it’s critical to
document all security controls the control system expects to inherit. During control
system design, the designer must identify and document any security controls which are
expected to be inherited.
2-1.4.1

Physical Security Inheritance Example.

DoD installations implement physical security to manage risk to an acceptable level.
For a control system on a DoD Installation, a security control requiring that members of
the public not be allowed unrestricted physical access to components of a control
system will be met by virtue of the control system existing within that physical security
boundary. Although military installations are on occasion opened to the public for
events such as boot camp graduations, the access is not unrestricted, and the level of
access has been accepted by installation security. Since control systems are innately
tied to and co-located with the physical systems they control, in most cases a control
system will be able to inherit physical security from the installation or separately secured
facilities.
2-1.4.2

Policy and Procedures Inheritance Example.

The DoD has polices in place governing many aspects of cybersecurity. A control
system can therefore inherit a security control such as “the organization defines the
frequency to review and update the current security planning policy”.
2-1.4.3

Connection to another System Inheritance Example.

When a control system connects to another system, such as an Installation-wide
network, inheritance may not be automatic but may require an agreement between the
SOs of the systems. Such an agreement would cover acceptable behavior of the
control system and explicitly define the security controls that will be inherited from the
other system.
2-1.5

Applicability of RMF Security Controls to Design.

Security controls cover a wide range of requirements, many of which must be
addressed by someone outside the control system design process. For example, a
security control 1 that states “The organization protects the control system from
unauthorized modification by members of the organization” is normally not addressed
1

This is not an actual security control, but rather an illustrative example using a fictitious control.

4

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
by the designer; but rather is addressed through policies and procedures put in place by
the organization that owns and operates the control system.
2-1.5.1
Systems.

Applicability of RMF Security Controls to Design of Critical

The determination of whether a security control should be applied at design can
become particularly complex for more critical (higher impact) systems. While it may be
sufficient for a LOW impact system to assume a particular security control is addressed
by another entity, the designer of a HIGH impact system may need to explicitly address
a security control to ensure it is being implemented properly, to apply it at a higher
standard, or to provide tools to the responsible parties to assist their implementation of
the security control.
For example, while a security control stating “The organization protects the control
system from unauthorized modification by members of the organization” might be
addressed through policies and procedures for a LOW impact system, a higher impact
system may require the designer to explicitly design in additional barriers to
unauthorized modification, or to provide guidance to the organization concerning the
importance of properly securing the control system against modification. In this case,
however, it’s vital to consider the impact these restrictions may have on the ability to
make necessary authorized changes. For this reason, designers of systems with HIGH
mission impact should likely seek the assistance of a dedicated cybersecurity engineer.
MODERATE systems may also require specialized attention depending on the
particular circumstances of the design.
2-2

5-LEVEL CONTROL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.

Even though control systems are becoming more like standard IT systems, there remain
major differences that must be recognized. The 5-Level control system architecture
shown in Figure 2-1 is a framework for describing the system architecture of any control
system. This architecture allows distinctions to be made between portions of the control
system that look like standard IT, and portions that do not look like standard IT. This is
important as many security controls can be applied in the normal fashion to the portion
of the control system that looks like a standard IT system, but cannot be applied without
modification (or sometimes at all) to the portion that does not look like a standard IT
system.
APPENDIX E provides a more in-depth description of the 5-Level control system
architecture.

The parts of the control system that most resemble a standard or traditional IT system
are referred to as the “Standard IT” parts:
•

The IP Network portion of Level 4 (Level 4N).

•

The IP Network portion of Level 2 (Levels 2N and 2B).

•

The field point of connection (FPOC) at Level 3.

•

The computer hardware for both servers and workstations (Levels 2D, 4A, 4B)

•

The computer OS and other standard packages (e.g., antivirus) for both servers
and workstations (desktops and laptops) (Levels 2D, 4A, 4B).

•

External connections and control system management at Level 5.

The cybersecurity for the “standard IT” parts of the control system are largely addressed
using standard cybersecurity practices and are generally outside the scope of control
system design, and are not addressed by this UFC. The designer must address the IP

Change 1, 18 January 2017
Network at Level 2N, which is generally procured and installed by the control system
contractor, and the control system specific software used by the front end, which is
generally not adequately covered by standard IT approaches.
2-2.2

“Non-Standard IT” Parts of the Control System.

What makes cybersecurity for a control system challenging is the parts of the control
system that do not generally resemble a standard IT system: Level 0, Level 1, Level
2A, Level 2C and the control system applications at Level 2D, Level 4A and Level 4B.
These parts of the control system are referred to as the “non-standard IT” parts in order
to differentiate them from the “standard IT” parts. Traditional cybersecurity tools and
requirements such as vulnerability management alerts, bulletins, Secure Technical
Implementation Guides (STIGs) and DoD IT Policies are seldom applicable to these
components, particularly to devices at Levels 0, 1 or 2. For example, a security control 2
requiring the screen to be locked when the user leaves the computer is not applicable to
devices that do not have a screen or support user login. Different levels of the
architecture have different issues related to the application of standard cybersecurity
tools and requirements.
Cybersecurity for these portions of the control system must be addressed by the control
system designer.
2-2.3

Platform Enclave.

Significant portions of the control system resemble a standard IT system which can be
implemented in a standard manner for different control systems, regardless of the
details of the control system itself. This has led to the creation of the Platform Enclave
concept, which groups the “standard IT” portions of the control system, plus related
standard policies and procedures, into an entity which can be handled separately from
the rest of the control system. In some cases this Platform Enclave will be separately
authorized and the overall control system will have two authorizations, one for the
Platform Enclave and one for the Operational Architecture which primarily covers the
“non-standard IT” components of the system. In other cases a single authorization will
be used for the entire system. Even in cases where a single authorization is used,
however, it’s helpful to identify and categorize the “standard IT” portions of the control
system. More information on the Platform Enclave approach is in 0.
2-3

CONTROL SYSTEM PROCUREMENT OVERVIEW.

The DoD does not procure most installation-wide control systems as an entire 5-Level
system as depicted in Figure 2-1. Typically, some Field Control Systems (FCS;
architecture Levels 0, 1 and 2 – see Figure 2-2) are procured with a front end, and over
time additional FCS are procured. These additional FCS are integrated with the existing
front end, and added to the authorization to operate for the existing system to expand
the installation-wide system. When designing a FCS that will be added to an existing
system, there may be cybersecurity requirements specific to the authorization of the
existing system which must be incorporated into the FCS design. This UFC cannot

address site-specific requirements; when designing systems which will be added to an
existing system authorization coordinate with the project site to obtain relevant
requirements from the existing system.
Some control systems are procured to operate independently, with no integration to a
larger system and without further significant expansion. Depending on the
circumstances and architecture, treat these systems either as complete systems,
containing all 4 or 5 Levels, or as a FCS (Level 0-2) with its own user interface at Levels
1 or 2. See Table E-3 in APPENDIX E for more information on the Level 2D computers.

CHAPTER 3 APPLYING CYBERSECURITY IN DESIGN
3-1

OVERVIEW.

The design of cybersecurity for facility-related control systems is a five step process. In
some cases a specific step may be performed by someone other than the designer, but
may still require input from the designer. Documentation of cybersecurity-related design
decisions and input to others is described in CHAPTER 5.
In addition to requirements specific to Control Correlation Identifier (CCIs), design all
control systems according to the minimum cybersecurity design requirements in
CHAPTER 4 and cybersecurity requirements otherwise standard for the type of control
system being designed.
3-1.1

Five Steps for Cybersecurity Design.

The five steps for cybersecurity design are:
Step 1: Based on the organizational mission and details of the control system,
the System Owner (SO) and Authorizing Official (AO) determine the
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C-I-A) impact levels (LOW,
MODERATE, or HIGH) for the control system.
Step 2: Use the impact levels to select the proper list of controls from NIST SP
800-82.
Step 3: Using the DoD master Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) list, create a list
of relevant CCIs based on the controls selected in Step 2.
Step 4: Categorize CCIs and identify CCIs that require input from the designer or
are the designer’s responsibility.
Step 5: Include cybersecurity requirements in the project specifications and
provide input to others as required.
APPENDIX H contains tables covering steps 2 – 4 for LOW and MODERATE systems,
assuming the existence of a Platform Enclave. These tables, with additional information
in a filterable format, are also available in Excel format on the RMF Knowledge Service
(https://rmfks.osd.mil). This website is CAC-enabled; designers without a CAC must
request assistance from the Service if tables and information were not provided. 0
provides additional guidance on the implementation of specific controls.
3-1.2

Definition of “Organization”.

Security controls often refer to the “organization” in identifying responsibilities and risk.
Unless otherwise indicated, for the purposes of implementation of the RMF to control
systems:

9

•
•

3-2

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
For determining the impact level of a system, treat the “organization” as
the relevant Service (e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force).
For determining implementation requirements for specific controls, treat
the “organization” as the Installation (garrison, post or base) or Region (for
regional systems). Note that this doesn’t conflict with the above
statement regarding the organization for determining impact, but rather
indicates the portion of the Service that will have responsibility for
implementation of the control.
STEP 1: DETERMINE CONTROL SYSTEM IMPACT RATING.

The SO, with concurrence from the AO, determines the impact levels of the control
system. The SO may seek assistance from the control system designer in defining the
functionality of the control system, the information the control system contains, and the
impact of failure of the control system. For the DoD, impact levels are determined based
on the mission of the relevant Service and in many cases can use the mission criticality
rating of the facility (mission support, mission essential, mission critical) as a starting
point to determining control system impact. It’s also important to note that while a
traditional information system generally prioritizes Confidentiality, then Integrity and
lastly Availability, control systems usually prioritize Availability first, then Integrity and
lastly Confidentiality.
If impact ratings aren’t provided, request them from the Service. If the Service is unable
to provide impact ratings then request direction from the Service and follow one of two
courses of action as directed:
1. Use the “starting” impact ratings for the control system type and facility
rating (mission support, mission essential, mission critical) from the
Control System Master List available at the RMF Knowledge Service
website (https://rmfks.osd.mil).
2. Do not proceed with the design until C-I-A Impact ratings are provided.
3-3

STEP 2: DETERMINATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS.

When the list of relevant controls is not provided by the Service, determine a starting list
of controls based on the Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I) and Availability (A) impact
ratings (or C-I-A ratings) provided by the \1\Service/1/. The DoD uses NIST SP 800-82
as an overlay to determine the starting baseline security controls for control systems.
The RMF Knowledge Service (https://rmfks.osd.mil) contains guidance on determining
controls from C-I-A ratings, including an Excel Spreadsheet that generates a control list
based on the impact ratings and the NIST SP 800-82 guidance. This website is CACenabled; designers without a CAC must request assistance from the Service if tables
and information were not provided.

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Recommend Security Controls to Tailor Out.

3-3.1

The standard security control baselines were developed for standard information
systems and contain security controls that are entirely inapplicable to control systems
(or other Platform Information Technology), or are prohibitive to implement due to
technical or resource constraints. The RMF process allows these baselines to be
tailored for the project by the removal or addition of specific controls. Review the list of
controls and provide recommendations for controls to be tailored out from (or added to)
the security control set as part of the cybersecurity documentation required by
CHAPTER 5.
Note this tailoring can either be applied at the security control level during Step 2 or at
the CCI level during Step 3 of the design process. For a LOW Impact system, Table H2 and Table H-3 list recommended CCIs to be tailored out.
3-4
STEP 3: IDENTIFICATION OF CONTROL CORRELATION
IDENTIFIERS.
Using the list of security controls from Step 2, create the list of corresponding control
correlation identifiers (CCIs). This list of CCIs provides the starting point for identifying
cybersecurity requirements to be included in control system design. The complete CCI
list is available at the RMF Knowledge Service website via the “Export All Assessment
Procedures to Spreadsheet" link at:
https://rmfks.osd.mil/rmf/General/SecurityControls/Pages/ControlsExplorer.aspx. From
the URL, select "All Control Families" from the "Choose Control Family" pull-down.
After the page re-populates with the controls, click on "Export Implementation Guidance
and Assessment Procedures" to download the CCIs into Excel.
Note: This website is CAC-enabled; designers without a CAC must request the CCI list
from the Service if it was not provided.
3-5
STEP 4: CATEGORIZATION OF CONTROL CORRELATION
IDENTIFIERS BY RESPONSIBILITY.
Categorize each CCI identified in Step 3 as one or more of the following categories:
•

DoD-Defined: Either the DoD has provided a value for the “organization
selected” values, or the DoD implementation guidance states that the CCI
is already met by existing policy or regulation. These values are defined
in the CCI list obtained from the RMF Knowledge Service. Note that
definition or guidance provided may not be relevant for a control
system – the organization definitions were determined from the
perspective of a traditional information system, not for a control
system.

•

Designer: The designer has a role to address for this CCI. Either the
designer needs to provide design specifications to cover a requirement for
the control system itself, or the designer must provide input to others
regarding the implementation or lack of feasibility of the CCI (typically
11

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
because the CCI was written with an IT system, not a control system in
mind).
•

Non-Designer: The CCI is beyond the responsibility of the designer, and
is the responsibility of someone else – typically the SO. This does not
diminish the importance of these CCIs, but as these CCIs are not the
responsibility of the designer they are beyond the scope of this UFC.

•

Platform Enclave: The CCI contains a requirement which is expected to
be implemented at the Platform Enclave and inherited by the control
system, or is mostly implemented at the Platform Enclave but also needed
within the field control system (in which case the CCI is also in the
“Designer” category). For example, passwords are implemented at the
Platform Enclave, but are also necessary at the control system user
interface itself, local display panels and some controllers (those which
support passwords). While implementation of the Platform Enclave is not
the designer’s responsibility (a key point of the Platform Enclave is that it
is a standard approach that can be implemented across multiple control
systems), it’s important to document CCIs the control system expects to
inherit from the Platform Enclave.
The Platform Enclave category is in many ways a special case of the NonDesigner category, as it indicates a CCI that is addressed by others.

•

Impractical: The CCI is impractical to fully implement in a control system,
but may be applied in a limited manner to at least some part of the control
system. In most cases, these are CCIs that can be implemented at Level
4 of the architecture, but would be prohibitively difficult to implement at
Levels 0, 1, or 2.

Many CCIs will be assigned multiple categories. For example a security control related
to passwords would be categorized in both Platform Enclave and Designer categories
as it must be addressed at the Level 4 computers as well as at Level 1 and Level 2. If
the DoD has selected a minimum password length for use with this control which cannot
be met by all devices, it would also be categorized as Impractical and the designer must
document how the security control was implemented for devices unable to meet the
DoD selected value.
3-6

STEP 5: INCORPORATE CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS.

In addition to requirements specific to CCIs, design all control systems according to the
minimum cybersecurity design requirements in CHAPTER 4 and cybersecurity
requirements otherwise standard for the type of control system being designed.
For each CCI identified as “designer”, address the CCI in one or more of the following
three ways:
•

Incorporate a design requirement in the specifications for the control
system.
12

•

•

3-6.1

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Select or identify required changes to standard CCI requirements which
affect CCI implementation, such as the value of a specific parameter.
Note that approval or rejection of these values by the\1\Service (the AO or
their designated representative)/1/ will impact control system design.
Provide information about the design to others so they can implement a
CCI. In particular, document CCIs that the system is expected to be
inherited from another system or the Platform Enclave.
Addressing DoD Selected Values in CCIs.

Many CCIs have DoD standard values and are indicated in the Master CCI List as being
automatically met or inherited based on the standard value. These CCIs have been
derived from the general security controls in NIST SP 800-53, without regard to special
consideration which might apply to a control system, such as the tailoring and
supplemental guidance in NIST SP 800-82. Many of these CCIs cannot be applied to
control systems using the approach identified by the DoD. In these cases, implement
the CCI to the greatest extent practical, and document the incompatibilities.
3-6.2

Other “Organization Defined Values” in CCIs.

For CCIs which refer to “organization defined values” where the DoD has not defined
value and one has not been provided, request appropriate values from the \1\Service. If
the Service/1/ is unable to provide values, propose reasonable values and document
the proposed value with rationale.
3-6.3

Requirement Definition and Implementation CCIs.

Often, one CCI defines a requirement, and a second requires the implementation of that
requirement. A hypothetical example 3 is:
•

CCI #1 says “organization defines which components collect audit
records”. The implementation guidance for this CCI says “this is
automatically met because the DoD has defined the components as ‘all
components’”.

•

CCI #2 says “the information system collects audit records at the defined
components”.

Together, these create an impossible requirement: if one accepts the definition in #1
(and that it’s “automatically met”), then the system fails to meet #2 because, for
example, Level 0 sensors can’t collect audit records. In this case, both CCIs are
“Designer” category; propose reasonable values for CCI #1, implement CCI #2 using
this value and document the proposed values for CCI #1.

3

This example uses simplified fictitious CCIs for illustrative purposes. The AU family of security controls deals with
audit logs.

CHAPTER 4 MINIMUM CYBERSECURITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
4-1

DESIGN TO MINIMIZE FAILURE.

4-1.1

Reduce Dependency on the Network.

Avoid dependence on the network for the execution of control strategies. For example,
a backup generator should always start based on a local measurement of utility
availability, and not require a network "START" command. When dependence on the
network is unavoidable, isolate that portion of the network as much as possible so that
non-local network outages do not affect the required portions of the network. When a
user interface is absolutely required for the functioning of a control strategy, consider a
local interface (local display panel) or a dedicated front end (Level 2 front end)
physically co-located with the equipment.
In some cases, it may be necessary to take additional steps to protect critical functions
from modification over the network, for example a controller where critical parameters
are exposed to network manipulation based on the controller design. In these cases,
design barriers to manipulation into the control network architecture itself. See
APPENDIX F for one possible approach.
4-1.2

Reduce Extraneous Functionality

Since additional capabilities often result in additional vulnerabilities, a key cybersecurity
concept is “least functionality”, which means not adding capabilities which are not
specifically needed. Design control system systems to minimize additional functionality
which may create vulnerabilities in the control system, including but not limited to:
•

Consider mission requirements before implementing remote adjustment of
system parameters which are not expected or required to change. For
example, a critical air conditioner serving a data center, a critical
command and control building, or a UPS room which needs to maintain
space temperature at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year should not have a network configurable operating schedule or setpoint.

•

Advanced or complex control strategies often require increased sensor
inputs and a greater level of maintenance. Use care when requiring these
strategies as the increased complexity results in increased probability of
failure if the system is not properly maintained or if any specific parameter
is compromised.

4-2

DESIGN TO MANAGE FAILURE.

4-2.1

Design for Graceful Failure.

4-2.1.1

Control Systems without Subsystems.

For control systems controlling a single process or piece of equipment, coordinate with
the equipment designer to determine any additional redundancy and failure
15

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
requirements, and design the control system to match the requirements for the
underlying equipment. In all cases design these systems to fail “safe” as defined by the
criteria for the controlled system. For example, in cold climates, outside air intake
dampers must fail closed based on the requirements of the heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning UFC.
4-2.1.2

Control Systems with Independent Subsystems.

Many control systems are described as a single system but are actually composed of
many (hundreds, even thousands) of essentially independent systems. A common
example of this would be an installation-wide UMCS, where the air handler (AHU)
controllers in one building have no dependence on the AHU in another building, and
often no dependence on AHUs in the same building.
For control systems with independent subsystems, design each subsystem as required
in paragraph 4-2.1.1, Control Systems without Subsystems, and also design the overall
system such that loss of a single subsystem does not affect the operation of the rest of
the system. Reduce information shared between subsystems and minimize
dependence on the network. For subsystems which must rely on other subsystems
define default (“fall back”) behavior in the event that the other subsystem fails.
4-2.2

Degraded Operation.

After a system fails to a safe state, it may need to resume operation in a degraded
capacity using some automated or manual method, recognizing there may be risk in this
operation but that risk is manageable and outweighed by mission requirements.
Based on mission requirements, consider requiring means for manual operation
including both monitoring instrumentation (e.g., thermometers, pressure gauges,
meters), and manual control devices (such as “hand-off-auto” switches and actuators
with manual actuation capability).
4-2.3

Redundancy.

If the criticality of the mission requires redundancy in the design of the control system,
then the system must be designed to function without external intervention, and
especially without human intervention. Design control strategies such that spare units
start automatically when running units shut down, or have all units run and share load.
Care must be taken when load-sharing to ensure that operators are notified when one
unit of a redundant set fails since the remaining units will automatically pick up the load
with no disruption in the load. Do not rely on an operator to start any backup unit; the
odds of the operator not being available, or taking an incorrect action are too great.
Provide alarms to alert operators of failures.
4-3

DO NOT IMPLEMENT STANDARD IT FUNCTIONS.

As a type of Platform IT, control systems are special purpose systems and must not be
used as general computing resources. In particular:
16

•

4-4

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Do not share control system resources with other systems, particularly
with non-PIT systems. Some exceptions such as separate virtual servers
running on common hardware or shared Ethernet media with separate
VLANs, may be permitted, but the overlap between control systems and
other systems must be minimized.

•

Do not allow control systems to provide, or share resources with, other
applications that provide standard IT services. In particular, do not use
control system components as Domain Name System (DNS) servers.
(DNS servers may be implemented within the “Platform Enclave” at Level
5, but that is beyond the scope of the control system designer’s
responsibility and not addressed by this UFC.)

•

Do not allow control systems to be publically accessible (i.e., they must
require authentication prior to access).

•

Prohibit the use of mobile code, except mobile code may be allowed at
Level 4. Note that control systems may use mobile code technologies,
Java in particular, within the control system, but must not download code
without direct user approval.

•

Do not use control system computers as standard computers for general
applications.

•

Do not implement Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) within the control
system.

•

Do not implement collaborative computing devices, technologies or
protocols within the control system.

•

Unless specifically authorized by the \1\Service/1/ and required by the
project site, do not allow control system components to access non-mil IP
address space. Do not allow control system components to access social
media. (Note that access to non-mil IP address space is generally not
needed, and when needed will generally be a function of the front end, not
the field control system.)

•

Do not allow control systems to receive email (note that at Level 4 they
may need a method of sending email for notifications).
DO NOT PROVIDE REMOTE ACCESS.

Do not provide remote access to the control system. If required, remote access to the
Level 4 network should be provided by the Platform Enclave or the site IT organization.
Coordinate remote access requirements with the project site IT organization and with
the POCs listed in CHAPTER 1.

DEFINITION OF TERMS

Term

Definition

Authorizing Official
(CNSSI No. 4009)

A senior (federal) official or executive with the authority to formally
assume responsibility for operating an information system at an
acceptable level of risk to organizational operations (including
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

Building Automation
System (BAS)

The system consisting of a UMCS Front End, connected Building
Control Systems which control building electrical and mechanical
systems, and user interfaces for building control supervision. The
BAS is a subsystem of the Utility Monitoring and Control System.
This term is being phased out in favor of UMCS.

Building Control
System (BCS)

A system that controls building electrical and mechanical systems
such as HVAC (including central plants), lighting, vertical transport
systems, and irrigation systems. Building Control Systems
generally do not have a full‐featured user interface; they may have
“local display panels” but typically rely on the UMCS front end for
full user interface functionality. BCS is a subsystem of the Utility
Monitoring and Control System, and is a class of Field Control
System.

Closed Circuit
Television System
(CCTV)

An ESS that allows video assessment of alarm conditions via
remote monitoring and recording of video events. Video monitoring
may also be incorporated into other systems which are not CCTV.

Control Correlation
Identifier (CCI)

The Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) provides a standard
identifier and description for each of the singular, actionable
statements that comprise a security control.

Control System (CS)

A system of digital controllers, communication architecture, and
user interfaces that monitor, or monitor and control, infrastructure
and equipment.

Controller

An electronic device – usually having internal programming logic
and digital and analog input/output capability – which performs
control functions. Two primary types of controller are equipment
controller and supervisory controller.

Distributed Control
System

This term is being phased out in preference of BCS, UCS, and/or
UMCS.

a control system, including network configuration, controller
configuration and controller programming.

Equipment Controller
(EC)

A controller implementing control logic to control a piece of
equipment. Note: a controller is defined by use, and many ECs
also have the capability to act as supervisory controllers (SC).
Some examples of equipment controllers are air handler
controllers, protective relays, and pump controllers. Note that some
devices, such as power meters or smart sensors, which only
perform monitoring functions are still considered equipment
controllers (despite not actually controlling anything).

Facility-Related
Control System

A control system which controls equipment and infrastructure that
is part of a DoD building, structure, or linear structure.

Field Control System
(FCS)

A Building Control System, Utility Control System, Access Control
System, etc. within the Facility and "downstream" of the FPOC.

Field Control

The network used by the Building Control System, Utility Control
System, etc., within a facility "downstream" of the FPOC. This
includes IP, Ethernet, RS-485, TP/FT-10 and other network
infrastructure that support control system(s) in a given facility.

Field Point of
Connection (FPOC)

The FPOC is the point of connection between the control system IP
network and the field control network (an IP network, a non-IP
network, or both). The hardware which provides the connection at
this location is an IT device such as a switch, IP router, or firewall.

[UMCS, ESS, etc.]
Front End

The portion of the control system consisting primarily of IT
equipment, such as computers and related equipment, intended to
perform operational functions and run monitoring and
control/engineering tool application software. The front end does
not directly control physical systems; it interacts with them only
through field control systems (FCS). The front end is a component
of the [UMCS, ESS, etc.] infrastructure (see definition).

Risk
(NIST SP 800-53)

A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a
potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the
adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event
occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. Information systemrelated security risks are those risks that arise from the loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information

APPENDIX C RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (RMF) OVERVIEW
C-1

RMF OVERVIEW

As defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the RMF is
“The process of managing risks to organizational operations (including mission,
functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information system, and includes: (i)
the conduct of a risk assessment; (ii) the implementation of a risk mitigation strategy;
and (iii) employment of techniques and procedures for the continuous monitoring of the
security state of the information system.”. The RMF details how Risk Management is
applied to Department of Defense (DoD) information technology in accordance with
DoDI 8510.01.
C-2

RMF PROCESS

As shown in Figure C-3, the RMF is a six-step process:
1. Categorize the System: Categorization of the control system by
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (C-I-A) Impact levels, taking into
consideration both the importance of the mission and the importance of
the control system to the mission. Determination of the C-I-A Impact
levels will be made by the System Owner (SO) and is outside the scope of
this UFC.
2. Select Security Controls: Based on the C-I-A level, a set of controls and
an overlay to be implemented will be selected from CNSSI No. 1253 and
NIST SP 800-82. In many cases, these controls will be further tailored
based on the requirements of the Control System prior to implementation.
While this UFC includes guidance concerning applicability of specific
controls, the process of selecting security controls is generally outside the
domain of the designer.
3. Implement Security Controls: Implementation of many security controls
will be outside the scope of designer responsibilities. This UFC focuses on
security controls which the designer must somehow address in design,
generally through the incorporation of requirements into the plans and
drawings, and on security controls which others may ask the designer to
provide input on.
4. Assess Security Controls: After implementation, the effectiveness of the
implementation is evaluated.
5. Authorize the System: Assuming a satisfactory evaluation, the Authorizing
Official (AO) formally accepts the residual risk from the control system and
authorizes operation of the system by issuing an authorization to operate.

6. Monitor Security Controls: The RMF enters a monitoring and evaluation
phase, where the control system is monitored and periodically reevaluated.

DEFINITION OF CONTROLS FROM NIST AND DODI 8510

C-3.1

Control Families

Since it is difficult to evaluate a performance requirement (“reduce risk below a specific
level”), NIST provides a catalog of prescriptive requirements where meeting a particular
requirement reduces the overall risk to the system. These requirements are broadly
categorized into the following groupings (which are often referred to as “control
families”):
•

AC – Access Control

•

AT – Awareness and Training

•

AU – Audit and Accountability

•

CA – Security Assessment and Authorization

•

CM – Configuration Management

•

CP – Contingency Planning

Control Elements and Enhancements

Within each control family, there are numerous controls; most having multiple subelements. Many controls also have enhancements, additional actions that can be taken
to enhance the effectiveness of the control. Individual controls are assigned a number
within the control family, enhancements are sub-numbered, and elements of controls or
enhancements are lettered. Enhancements and elements are written in parenthesis
after the control number. An example of NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 is shown in

C-3.3

Control Correlation Identifiers

The DoD implementation of the NIST controls for control systems is DoDI 8500. The
DoD took the additional step of breaking down each control and control element into
specific actions; each action is identified by a unique Control Correlation Identifier (CCI).
For example, the above control, AC-2, is broken down into 61 separate CCIs, with 11
distinct CCIs for AC-2 (4) alone.
While this leads to a very fine level of implementation (the control system could audit
account creation, but not audit account modification), it also leads to many
dependencies between CCIs. For example, two of the CCIs associated with security
control AC-2(4) found on the RMF Knowledge Service (Security Control Explorer) are:

36

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
CCI-000018: “The information system automatically audits account
creation actions.”
CCI-001683: “The information system notifies organization-defined
personnel or roles for account creation actions.”

Note: The RMF Knowledge Service website is https://rmfks.osd.mil.
While these are written as independent CCIs, they are clearly closely related and it is
difficult to imagine a notification system that did not include an auditing capability.
C-4

REQUIREMENT DEFINITION VS IMPLEMENTATION

Broadly speaking, CCIs can be categorized into requirement definition and requirement
implementation.
1. A CCI defines a requirement when the CCI is of the form “<someone>
defines a <requirement>”. Examples of CCIs that define a requirement
include those that state “The organization defines ….”
a. “…a minimum level of detail for documentation”,
b. “…a minimum frequency to review some criteria”,
c. “…a list of events that raise a red flag for security”, or
d. “…a policy or procedure for modifications to the control system”
2. A CCI implements a requirement when the CCI is of the form
“<someone/something> meets a <requirement>”, where the requirement
is typically defined in a related CCI. Examples of CCIs which implement a
requirement defined in the previous example include CCIs that state “The
organization ….”
a. …obtains the required level of documentation”,
b. …reviews a security plan annually”,
c. …responds to breaches of physical security”, or
d. …approves changes to the control system via a configuration
management board”
C-4.1

CCIs Defining a Requirement

CCIs which define a requirement may be addressed by the designer, but are often
addressed by the organization or already defined DoD-wide. In some cases, the final
statement of the requirement may be by the organization, but with input from the
designer based on knowledge of the control system and the specific vulnerability to be
addressed. For example, the designer needs to provide input on password complexity
37

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
since not all control system components will support passwords, and those that do may
support different complexities. In many cases, DoD-defined requirements are
completely inappropriate for control systems and the designer must document
deviations from the DoD definitions for these requirements in the design.
C-4.2

CCIs Requiring Implementing a Requirement

Implementation CCIs may further be classified by who/what does the implementation:
the organization (or inherited from some other element) or the control system. “The
organization conducts background checks” is an example of the former while “the
control system logs users off after a period of inactivity” belongs to the latter. In some
cases, this is not clear – a CCI that states “The organization enforces a minimum
password length” 5 appears to create a requirement on the organization, but a moments
consideration will make clear that this action must be implemented by the control
system (since the control system either accepts or rejects a password entry), not the
organization. CCIs that are implemented by the organization are not addressed by the
designer and are outside the scope of this UFC. On the other hand, CCIs that are
implemented by the control system must typically be addressed by the designer since
implementing a CCI becomes a performance requirement in the specification of the
control system.
C-5

PLATFORM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

The DoD implementation of the RMF defines Platform Information Technology (PIT) as
“IT, both hardware and software, which is physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in
real time to the mission performance of special purpose systems”, and differentiates PIT
systems from standard information systems. Most specifically, DoDI 8500.01 indicates
that PIT Systems “require uniquely tailored security control sets and control validation
procedures and require security control assessors and AOs with specialized
qualifications”
The Cybersecurity of PIT systems, such as control systems, requires not only the use of
customized control baselines, but also further tailoring of controls as appropriate for the
specific control system.

This is not the text of an actual CCI, but rather a simple fictitious example used for illustrative purposes.

APPENDIX D PLATFORM ENCLAVE
D-1

PLATFORM ENCLAVE CONCEPT OVERVIEW

The fact that a significant portion of the control system resembles a standard IT system
which can be implemented for different control system regardless of the details of the
control system itself has led to the creation of the Platform Enclave concept. This
concept groups the standard IT portions of the control system into a system which can
be handled separately from the rest of the control system. In some cases this Platform
Enclave will be separately authorized and the overall control system will have two
authorizations, while in other cases a single authorization will be used for the entire
system. Even in cases where a single authorization is used, however, it’s helpful to
identify and categorize the standard IT portions of the control system.
D-2

PLATFORM ENCLAVE USING TWO AUTHORIZATIONS

A primary reason to define to a Platform Enclave is to enable the approach where a
control system is implemented using two Risk Management Framework authorizations,
one for the Platform Enclave and one for the non-Platform Enclave portions of the
control system, sometimes referred to as the “non-standard IT” portions. While this may
seem to lead to a duplication of effort, in practice this generally isn’t the case:

D-3

•

While many controls, such as policies and procedures, will need to be
done at both the Platform Enclave and “non-standard IT” portions, these
policies and procedures can often be inherited by both from another
Authorization, or implemented the same way in both the Platform Enclave
and the “non-standard IT”.

•

Some controls can be applied at the Platform Enclave and then inherited
by the “non-standard IT”. For example, controls related to remote access
can be defined independently of the “non-standard IT” by the Platform
Enclave, and then inherited by the “non-standard IT” if necessary.

•

While some controls will need to be addressed by both the Platform
Enclave and the “non-standard IT”, they will need to be addressed
differently, and often to a different extent, in each.
PLATFORM ENCLAVE BENEFITS

The primary benefit of the Platform Enclave approach is that it allows for separation of
the “standard IT” and “non-standard IT” components of the control system, and allows
for a single authorization for the IT portion to cover multiple control system types. This
approach is most beneficial when there is an existing network and cybersecurity
infrastructure on which to establish the Platform Enclave, such as those that exist on the
majority of DoD installations. Ideally, the Platform Enclave will be a standard
established and authorized by each Service for implementation at every installation, in
contrast to the authorization for the “non-standard IT” portion of the control system (the
“Operational Architecture”), where factors such as control system type, vendor and
protocol are more likely to make each authorization unique and non-standard.

APPENDIX E 5-LEVEL CONTROL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
E-1

INTRODUCTION

As shown in Figure E-1, control systems are represented as a 5-Level architecture,
where each level represents a collection of components that are logically grouped
together by function and which generally share a cybersecurity approach. This
architecture is defined as a general architecture suitable for a wide range of control
systems, thus there are some key considerations when using it to describe a specific
control system:
•

Not every implementation of a control system will make use of every level,
or every type of component shown at a level.

•

The same device may reside in different levels, depending on its
configuration. For example, some controllers may support different
networks based on onboard switches, and thus the same device could
reside in either Level 1 or Level 2.

•

In many cases, a device will fit multiple sub-levels within the same
principal level, usually within Level 2. For example, a Level 2A controller
may act as a Level 2C router to a Level 1 network beneath it.

This Appendix describes the 5-Level architecture for control systems and presents
cybersecurity considerations for each level. Note that although there are actually more
than five levels in the architecture shown in Figure E-1, it is commonly referred to as the
“5-Level Control System Architecture”. This architecture applies to all control system
types; while many of the example components or technologies included in this Appendix
are based on building or utility control systems this is not meant to imply that this
architecture is specific to these types of control systems.

5-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

A brief description of each Level (from simple to complex devices) is:
Level 0. Non-networked devices which communicate using analog signals. These
include (“dumb”) sensors and actuators as well as non-networked
controllers (including their dedicated sensors and actuators). These
communicate with Level 1 via hardware I/O (Analog and Binary signals).
Level 1. Networked controllers not on an IP network (e.g., BACnet MS/TP, RS-485
(e.g., DNP, Modbus), LonWorks TP/FT-10).
Level 2. Networked controllers on an IP network.
Level 3. The Field Point of Connection (FPOC), which is a connection between the
field control system IP network at Level 2 and the Level 4 IP network.

45

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Level 4. The site-wide IP network used for the control system, along with front end
servers and workstations (desktops and laptops).
Level 5. Interfaces to “external” networks (IP networks other than the control system
network).
Note that some levels contain sub-levels as indicated in Figure E-1.
E-3

LEVEL 0: SENSORS AND ACTUATORS

Level 0 consists of non-networked devices which communicate using analog signals.
These include (“dumb”) sensors and actuators, as well as non-networked controllers.
These communicate with Level 1 or Level 2 via hardware I/O (Analog and Binary
signals). Details for Level 0 are shown in Table E-1.
Table E-1 Level 0
LEVEL 0: Sensors and Actuators
Definition

Level 0 devices lack a network and therefore cannot be attacked
over a network. Level 0 devices, if they communicate at all, use
only simple analog and binary signals, they do not use any form
of digital protocol for communication. A sensor or actuator that
uses a communications protocol (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth) is a
Level 1 (non-IP) or Level 2 (IP) device.

Functional
Description

The interface between the control system and the underlying
controlled process / equipment where electrical signals in the
control system get converted to/from physical values and actions
in the underlying controlled system.
Level 0A consists of Sensors and actuators
Level 0B consists of non-networked controllers and their integral
sensors and actuators. Level 0B devices may have some
intelligence and may even have an internal network, but the
device does not expose any internal network to other devices.
These devices are typically packaged units with factory-installed
integral controllers.
Note that a “stand-alone” built-up unit with multiple field installed
controllers which communicate over a network specific to that
unit is NOT a Level 0 component, but rather a stand-alone field
control system of its own.

LEVEL 0: Sensors and Actuators
Implemented Via

Devices which:
•

Convert physical properties (e.g., temperature, pressure,
etc.) to a binary or analog electrical signal

•

Take a binary or analog electrical signal and produce a
physical action (e.g., open / close a valve or damper, etc.)

These electrical signals are purely binary or analog – there are
no exposed digital signals or networks at this level. Also note
that "smart" sensors or “smart” actuators which include a
controller and network connection are considered to be Level1 or
Level 2 devices.
Installed By

Controls contractor during installation or renovation of underlying
mechanical or electrical system.

Example
Components

The vast majority of these devices are very simple (“dumb”)
sensors or actuators, but more complex equipment may be at
level 0 – as long as it lacks a network connection. Some
examples are:
•

A thermistor temperature sensor which simply provides a
changing resistance as an indication of temperature is a
Level 0A device.

•

An electric actuator which takes a 4-20 mA signal and
produces a proportional physical response is a Level 0A
device.

•

An occupancy sensor which uses BACnet to communicate
occupancy values is a Level 1 (or Level 2) device, not a
Level 0 device.

•

A variable frequency drive controlling an air handler fan
and using only binary and analog signals to communicate
with the air handler controller is a Level 0B device.

•

A flow sensor using HART over an analog wire is using a
digital protocol (HART) and is a Level 1 device, not a
Level 0 device.

•

A packaged diesel generator operating in a stand-alone
configuration – again with no network connection to other
devices - is a Level 0B device.

The last two examples illustrate that the defining characteristic for
Level 0 is not the complexity of the device, but rather whether the
device communicates with other devices using a network.

LEVEL 0: Sensors and Actuators
Security Control
Considerations

E-4

In general, management and operational controls such as
physical security and access control may still apply to this level.
These devices are physically attached to the
mechanical/electrical system and physical security is dictated
and implemented based on the physical access to the
equipment. Utility vaults, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing rooms,
Pump Stations, etc. should be secure and only authorized
personnel should have access. These devices, while they do not
have network communication, can cause physical damage, for
example a valve left in the “Open” position.

LEVEL 1: FIELD CONTROL SYSTEM (NON-IP)

Level 1 contains networked controllers not on an IP network (e.g., BACnet MS/TP, RS485 (e.g., DNP, Modbus), LonWorks TP/FT-10). Details for Level 1 are shown in Table
E-2.
Table E-2 Level 1
LEVEL 1: Field Control System (non-IP)
Definition

That portion of the controls network which does not use the IP
protocol. This includes both the controllers themselves (Level
1A) and the network (Level 1N).

Functional
Description

(Level 1A) This is where the control logic resides and gets
converted to or from binary and analog electrical signals, as well
as the portion of the control system where:
•

Analog and binary electrical signals (from sensors) get
converted to digital signals via analog-to-digital (A-D)
converters.

•

Digital information is converted to analog and binary
electrical signals (to actuators) via digital-to-analog (D-A)
converters.

•

Digital information is transmitted and received over a
network.

•

Digital information is processed according to a userdefined sequence to generate new digital information.

•

Devices may incorporate integral Level 0 sensors and
actuators, for example, many variable air volume (VAV)

Change 1, 18 January 2017
LEVEL 1: Field Control System (non-IP)
box controllers incorporate an electric actuator.
Not all controllers will have hardware inputs. While there is
exchange of data over the network, good design practice dictates
that most of the data processing occurs using local sensor data
and local actuator outputs; the system is designed to minimize
dependence on networked data.
(Level 1N) The Level 1 network (media and hardware) does not
use IP. It uses a variety of media at Layers 1 and 2 (some
standard, some not) and it uses Layer 3 protocols other than IP.
Some examples are:
•

BACnet over MS/TP, or BACnet over ARCnet

•

LonTalk over TP/FT-10 or LonTalk over TP/XF-1250

•

Modbus over RS-485

For this reason, it is generally very specific to the control
application and cannot be used for "standard" IT protocols and
applications.
Implemented Via

(Level 1A) Controllers, typically equipped with multiple analog
and binary inputs and outputs and corresponding A-D and D-A
converters. These devices are driven by cost to have the
minimal functionality for the application and are very constrained
in random access memory (RAM), processing power, and
network input/output (I/O). In addition, these devices come in a
vast variety of architectures, processors, vendors, and firmware.
(Level 1N) The network media and hardware is similarly
dedicated to that specific control protocol, and is made by a
variety of vendors.

Installed By

Controls contractor during installation or renovation of underlying
mechanical or electrical system.
Generally during new building construction or major renovation.

Security Control

Since devices (controllers) in this tier tend to be simpler devices,

Considerations

E-5

often few security controls can be applied, particularly after the
system has been designed and installed. Some basic
controls/measures that can be applied at this tier include:
•

Disabling (or at a minimum prohibiting) secondary network
connections (connections other than to the Level 1
network)

•

The use of passwords on devices such as displays (to the
capability supported by the device – many of which do not
permit 14 character passwords, for example)

•

The application of physical security measures – which will
be dictated and implemented by the underlying equipment

LEVEL 2: FIELD CONTROL SYSTEM (IP)

Level 2 consists of networked controllers on an IP network. Details for Level 2 are
shown in Table E-3.
Table E-3 Level 2
LEVEL 2: Field Control System (IP)
Definition

Functional
Description

The portion of the control system which uses IP but is not
shared with any other system. “Shared” in this context
primarily refers to physical equipment and media.
2A

This Level (along with Level 1) is where the control logic
resides and where it gets converted to/and from electrical
signals and can have the first IP connections. This is the
portion of the control system where:
•

Analog and binary electrical signals (from sensors)
get converted to digital signals via A-D converters
(although not all controllers will have hardware
inputs).

•

Digital information is converted to analog and binary
electrical signals (to actuators) via D-A converters
(although not all controllers will have hardware
outputs).

•

Digital information is transmitted and received over
a network.

•

Digital information is processed according to a userdefined sequence to generate new digital
information.

•

These devices may incorporate integral Level 0
sensors and actuators, for example, many Variable
Air Volume (VAV) box controllers incorporate an
electric actuator.

2N/2B The IP network (media and hardware) dedicated to the
control network and carrying the control protocol (e.g.,
Distributed Network Protocol (DNP), IEC-61850,
BACnet/IP or Lon/IP)). Generally IP over Ethernet.
2C

Control Protocol Routers and Gateways. Control Protocol
Routers route the control protocol – that is, they selectively
forward control protocol packets based on destination
address. They are not IP routers. Control Protocol
Gateways translate between Control Protocols.

2D

Where the local control system has an elevated C-I-A
requirement, a reliability requirement, an operator
response time, or a need for local operators which cannot
be met by the remote site-wide front end, the facility control
system may contain a local operator interface similar to
what is normally found at Level 4, but dedicated to this
specific control system.
In other cases, for either legacy or stand-alone systems
(not necessarily isolated, but stand alone in that they do
not rely on another system such as an control system), the
front end operator interface may be physically local to that
system. In this case, the operator interface is considered
to be part of Level 2 since it is dedicated to that building or
facility and traffic between it and the Level 1 and Level 2
devices does not pass through the Level 3 FPOC.

the other
2N/2B The Level 2N network is generally Ethernet and the Level
2B network hardware is standard IT network hardware,
though sometimes with reduced functionality. For
example, there may not be any requirement for remotely
managed switches. Similarly, there is seldom a need for
an IP router, since field control systems generally reside
within a single (private) IP subnet.

Security Control
Considerations

2D

Control system at a central plant where the nature and
criticality of the system requires a local operator interface.

2A

Controllers residing on the dedicated IP network vary
greatly from devices residing on a typical IP network.
•

They use a single fixed protocol (or a small number
of fixed protocols)

•

They often do not support “log in” functionality

•

There is often no “session” capability

•

They usually do not include a user interface, and if
they do it’s generally extremely limited.

•

They have very limited hardware capabilities (RAM,
CPU, storage, etc.)

•

They generally do not use Windows, and seldom
use Linux. They are generally some version of a
real time operating system (RTOS).

Many of the controllers will have the same limitations as
the controllers in Level 1, where most security controls
cannot/or will not apply to them. Some controllers will
have significantly more capability, however, and additional
controls will be applicable. In either case, the controllers
should disable any network connections or services not
required for operation of the control system.
2N/2B This network is dedicated to the control system and is
generally installed by the control system contractor, not the
IT organization. This doesn’t reduce the need for securing
this network, but does affect the way in which this network
is secured, and the risks and vulnerabilities that need to be
addressed Some key differentiators between the Level 2
network and a standard IP network are:
•

The network structure and connected devices
remain more static throughout the life of the system.

53

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
LEVEL 2: Field Control System (IP)
Generally components are not added and removed
on a regular bases.
•

The protocol(s) used are fixed, and in many cases
only a single protocol is used. The protocols also
differ from “regular” IP networks in that they are
control system protocols rather than standard IT
protocols.

•

Bandwidth usage is lower. Because the network
configuration is more static, the bandwidth usage is
also more fixed.

•

The devices residing on the network have fewer
capabilities, and generally don’t support network
security standards such as IEEE 802.1X.

•

The control system does not require the level of
functionality that Approved Product List (APL)
network infrastructure devices provide. The Navy,
however, does require APL products for all IP
Network Hardware..

•

Standard IT devices typically do not meet the UL
Listing requirements for fire and life safety systems,
so specialized network hardware may be required to
meet the control system needs.

2C

These devices are not manufactured by traditional IT
companies and do not run standard IT software. Their
functionality is often included as part of a Level 2A device.
They do not route IP.

2D

While functionally, Level 2D components act similarly to
computers at Level 4, the fact that they are local to (and
dedicated to) a specific control systems means that from a
security controls perspective, they are better addressed as
Level 2 components.
There are two main reasons for computers at Level 2D:
•

Legacy systems that cannot be patched. The
computers at Level 2D may be running an older
operating system and may not support some of the
security controls. In this case, the controls which
can be applied without negatively affecting the
availability of the system should be applied, and
mitigating controls and measures should be taken

54

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
LEVEL 2: Field Control System (IP)
when otherwise needed. Systems containing these
computers should not be connected to other
systems (i.e., should be operated stand-alone) until
they can be properly addressed, with the computers
replaced or otherwise upgraded to Level 4
standards.
•

E-6

Where a new system requires a local front end that,
for whatever reason, cannot be installed on the
basewide shared IP network (Level 4). This is
typically due to a C-I-A requirement. When installing
a new system with a Level 2 front end, it’s important
to note that the Level 2 front end should be subject
to the same controls as a Level 4 front end. While
implementation and inheritance of security controls
at this level may differ from the Level 4 front end,
computers at this Level should be subject to the
same controls as a “normal” Level 4 front end of
equivalent criticality.

LEVEL 3: FIELD POINT OF CONNECTION (FPOC)

Level 3 contains Field Point of Connection (FPOC), which is a logical connection
between the field control system IP network at Level 2 and the Level 4 IP network.
Details for Level 3 are shown in Table E-4
Table E-4 Level 3

Description

For each field control system, the FPOC is the specific single
demarcation point in the control system between that field
control system and the front end system. The FPOC is a
standard IT device, usually an Ethernet Switch.
The FPOC generally has security controls in that it restricts
access (by user, protocol, or specific commands) between levels
above and levels below.
Note that a large system will have hundreds of these FPOC
devices, one at each connection of a field control system to the

Security Control
Considerations

This device is critical from a security controls perspective as it is
where the dedicated local field control network connects to the
installation-wide IP network. Normally, securing this device
protects the installation-wide network from the local field systems
(which often have a difficult time meeting security controls).
Occasionally, where there is a critical field control system, this
device can protect the more critical field control system from the
less-secure local system (i.e., where there are 99 non-critical
systems and 1 critical one, isolate the 1 from the 99 rather than
try and secure the 99).
This device should, in effect, have a "deny all / permit by
exception" policy applied. The FPOC should be set up with the
most restrictive set of access control list (ACL) possible.

LEVEL 4: Control System Front End and Control System IP Network
standard IS, however, and that controls must be applied in such
a way as to not hamper the availability of the system. For
example, some control systems require software updates from
the manufacturer prior to the implementation of a Java patch,
and controls relating to the application of patches must not be
implemented in a manner that requires automatic or immediate
patching without ensuring that this won’t cause the system to go
offline. Unlike standard IT applications (such as virus software
or office automation tools), these PIT applications are generally
a niche product and while standard guidance may cover some
aspects of securing these application, it will likely be insufficient
to fully secure them.

Description

In many architectures, this level provides the enclave boundary
defense between the control system (at Level 4 and below) and
IP networks external to the control system. (In other
architectures, this boundary defense occurs in the external

APPENDIX F CYBERSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTEGRATING CRITICAL
UTILITY OR BUILDING CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH NON-CRITICAL UMCS
NOTE: This appendix applies to Utility Control Systems (UCS) and Building Control
Systems (BCS). For the purpose of this Appendix, the term Field Control Systems
(FCS) is used to refer to both UCS and BCS, but not necessarily to other Field Control
System (FCS) types.
F-1

INTRODUCTION

In those cases where a Building Control System (BCS) or Utility Control System (UCS)
contains classified information, controls critical infrastructure, or otherwise supports
critical missions or life safety, the FCS is a critical system. While some of the
requirements for securing the FCS are covered in the list of CCIs to be applied to a
MODERATE or HIGH system, there are issues specifically related to critical systems on
a typical installation where the preponderance of systems are non-critical.
There are three main approaches to address the connection of a critical FCS to a
UMCS:
1. Secure the UMCS at the same Impact level as the FCS. Conceptually,
this is the most straightforward approach, but it requires the UMCS Front
End to be addressed at the higher Impact level, and also requires special
consideration all other connected FCS which are not at the higher impact
level (and are therefore connecting to a higher impact system). A typical
DoD installation will have many more non-critical FCS than critical FCS,
so this approach will often prove to be impractical, particularly when
connecting a lower impact FCS to a higher impact UMCS Front End is
difficult. This approach is the preferred solution for the Navy, and the
Navy has identified an approach to connect the lower impact systems
without requiring them to be assessed at the higher impact level.
2. Implement a stand-alone UMCS for the FCS. In this case, the FCS is
part of a dedicated critical UMCS which is not connected to the UMCS
serving the larger installation. This approach eliminates the risk of
connection to a less critical system, but requires that the critical UMCS
function independently, with its own dedicated UMCS operators. It also
removes the ability to remotely monitor the critical system or to include the
critical system in installation-wide supervisory functions.
In many cases this approach is logistically infeasible to sustain, and must
be carefully considered before implementing. Facility operation and
maintenance staff must be willing and able to operate the stand-alone
facility for this approach to work.
3. Provide a secure connection between the critical FCS and a noncritical UMCS. This approach connects the critical FCS to the

60

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
installation-wide UMCS in a way that does not increase the impact level of
the UMCS. While this connection requires a great deal of planning and
care, it can provide a more practical means of connecting the critical FCS
than either implementing a stand-alone UMCS or raising the Impact level
of the installation-wide UMCS.
This approach provides a security separation between the FCS and
UMCS and is the preferred approach for the Army.
This Appendix presents design considerations specifically for connecting critical building
control systems to a non-critical UMCS as described in approach 3. Considerations for
the implementation of approach 1 or 2 are NOT addressed herein. While the
considerations in this Appendix may be applicable to other control systems, particularly
other building control systems or utility control systems, they are discussed here within
the context of a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Building Control
System.
F-2

LIMIT OUTSIDE FUNCTIONALITY

The key concept in connecting a critical FCS to a non-critical UMCS is limiting the ability
of the UMCS to affect the FCS. The interactions between the FCS and UMCS should
be specific and well-defined, and restricted to those required for system operation. In
general this will entail information from the FCS being sent to the UMCS for monitoring
while greatly restricting or even eliminating information from the UMCS being sent to the
FCS for control purposes. For example, a critical FCS may send status and alarm
information to the non-critical UMCS, but should not be receiving start/stop commands
from the UMCS as this introduces vulnerabilities to the critical system. Manual changes
to the critical FCS should always be carefully considered – by an operator in the zone,
with full awareness of their actions and understanding of the impact of their
actions.
F-3

FCS-UMCS CONNECTION METHODS

Limiting possible actions is a very difficult requirement for networked controllers, in
many cases the aggressor can connect their laptop to the UMCS network and download
a new program to a device in the critical FCS. This is not to trivialize the significant
barriers preventing this action, but by assumption, the UMCS is not sufficiently secured
to protect the FCS, so it must be assumed that this action is possible and guard against
it. This is similar to the additional physical security usually protecting a critical facility.
Even though there are barriers limiting access to the installation in general, the
assumption is that an aggressor can get access to the installation and critical facilities
have additional physical security to further limit access.
There are three primary methods which can be employed to provide a secure
connection between a critical FCS and a non-critical UMCS: a Hardware I/O interface,
Hardware Gateway, and Network Firewall. Of these three, the recommended approach
for critical FCS is the use of the Hardware I/O interface.
61

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
F-3.1

Hardware I/O Interface

The most secure method to connect a FCS to a UMCS is to share data across the
boundary using only analog and binary signals. Do not connect the FCS to the UMCS
via a network. Using hardware I/O prevents an aggressor from “piggybacking” an
unwanted command onto the interface as the information exchange is defined and
restricted by the hardware connections. Even if an aggressor controls the untrusted
device, the trusted device can only receive the commands that it has been designed
and constructed to receive.
F-3.1.1

Hardware I/O Interface Overview

A Hardware I/O Interface consists of two controllers which share information between
systems via binary or analog I/O, typically using dry contacts, 4-20mA signals or 0-10V
signals.
Figure F-1 illustrates a Hardware I/O Interface where a generator serving a critical
facility provides a few key monitoring points to a UMCS, and receives a control point,
"Request to Start" from the UMCS. It’s important that this point is only a Request for
the system to start, and that the actual decision of whether the generator will start or
stop must be made by the critical FCS.
Figure F-1 Hardware I/O Interface Example

62

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
F-3.1.2

Hardware I/O Interface Implementation

Implementing a Hardware I/O Interface requires controllers on the FCS and UMCS with
matching hardware points. An aggressor could apply excessive voltages to the I/O lines
and physically damage the controller on the FCS side. To mitigate this vulnerability,
either:
•

Use a controller dedicated to the communication interface and performing
no other functions on the FCS side so that damage to it doesn’t impact the
control system.
or

•

Provide optical isolation of the analog and binary signals between the
devices.

The controller on the UMCS side of the connection may be on a controller which
performs other functions as the concern is exposing the more critical FCS to risk from
the UMCS, and not the other direction. While the controller on the UMCS side is
logically part of the UMCS (a "hardware I/O gateway"), procurement and installation
may be simpler if it is furnished and installed by the FCS contractor.
F-3.1.3

Hardware I/O Interface Advantages and Disadvantages

This method is by far the most secure method of communication between the FCS and
UMCS, as there is nothing an aggressor can do to the untrusted device that impairs the
critical system. The potential disadvantage of this approach is the additional cost in the
procurement and installation of two additional hardware I/O points each monitoring
and/or control point. Depending on the amount and complexity of data being shared
this may or may not be more costly than other approaches.
This approach is also conceptually the easiest to implement and requires no particular
cybersecurity expertise skill, other than careful attention to limiting control points.
F-3.2

Hardware Gateway Interface

A Hardware Gateway is another means of connecting a critical FCS to a non-critical
UMCS. While not as secure as a Hardware I/O Interface, it will be much more costeffective if there is a large amount of data to exchange between the FCS and UMCS.
F-3.2.1

Hardware Gateway Overview

In this context, a gateway is a device with a connection to the UMCS network and a
separate connection to the FCS network that does not pass network traffic between the
two connections (i.e., it does not route packets between the two networks). Instead,
information from one network is received by the gateway, processed by the gateway
and then identical information is transmitted on the other network. While in theory the
UMCS and FCS could both use the same protocol (e.g. BACnet), in practice it may be

63

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
difficult to find a gateway using the same protocol on “both sides” that is sufficiently
secure, as typical designs would use the same connection for matching protocols.
F-3.2.2

Hardware Gateway Implementation

The key requirements for implementing a secure gateway are:
•

The gateway must provide complete isolation / separation between the
UMCS network and FCS network. This requires 2 separate network
connections and may be difficult to meet if the FCS and UMCS protocols
are the same.

•

The gateway must not be able to be programmed, configured, or
otherwise modified from the UMCS network. Since the gateway can likely
be configured over the “primary” network, this requirement may be difficult
to achieve if the UMCS and FCS protocols are the same. If both use the
same protocol, the gateway is more likely to be configurable from both the
UMCS and FCS. The configuration capability depends on the actual
implementation of the gateway, so care must be taken to specify that the
Gateway is not configurable from the UMCS network.

•

The gateway must be configured to only expose those points absolutely
necessary for the UMCS.

The gateway is part of the FCS and should be installed by the FCS contractor.
F-3.2.3

Hardware Gateway Advantages and Disadvantages

The main security concern with the gateway (assuming the above requirements are
met) is security flaws in the gateway implementation. Just as a web server may have a
flaw which allows an aggressor to take control of the server, a gateway may have an
implementation flaw which would allow control of the gateway; once in control of the
gateway, the aggressor could reconfigure the gateway to attack the FCS itself.
The gateway may provide a cost-effective alternative to the use of Hardware I/O points
for systems with a requirement to share many points, and the cost of the gateway is not
as dependent on the number of points as the Hardware I/O Interface.
F-3.3

Firewall Interface

The third option for securing a network connection between the UMCS and FCS is to
allow a network connection but use a firewall to selectively block traffic between the two
networks. The firewall requires a network connection, and is therefore only applicable
when the UMCS and FCS use the same protocol.
F-3.3.1

Firewall Interface Overview

Unlike a gateway where there is no network connection between the two networks and
the gateway explicitly transmits information from one to the other, with the firewall the

64

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
two networks are connected and the firewall selectively limits the traffic allowed
between the two. This inherently makes the firewall less secure than the gateway.
F-3.3.2

Firewall Interface Implementation

The key requirements for a secure firewall are:
•

The firewall can only be programmed from within the critical facility. This is
usually not a difficult requirement to meet because as security appliances,
firewalls are designed with a "secure" side and an "insecure" side.

•

Unlike traditional IT firewalls, the firewall must be able to filter traffic based
on the detailed information in the packet. While a standard firewall can
limit traffic based on IP address and TCP/UDP port, and might block all
traffic except that going to or from the UMCS server, the control system
firewall must also be able to block all but specific commands. In addition
to blocking all traffic except to/from the UMCS front end server, it might
also block all traffic except for very specific messages – such as a BACnet
ReadProperty requests for specific point values. This requires a firewall
that understands the specific control protocol (BACnet in this case) and
can selectively block traffic based on the specific message.

F-3.3.3

Firewall Interface Pros and Cons

The main implementation problem with a firewall is the lack of availability of a firewall
that can decode control protocol packets and selectively filter based on the message.
One advantage of the firewall over the gateway is that the firewall is designed for
security and is less likely to have an implementation flaw than the gateway, which is
typically not designed as a security device.
F-4

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

F-4.1

Local User Interfaces

Critical systems should be provided with additional local User Interfaces to allow
maintenance personnel inside the secure area access to control data to allow for
troubleshooting. Liberal use of local display panels is strongly recommended. For
larger critical systems, it might be desirable to provide a more functional interface than
normally obtainable via LDPs, such as an independent UMCS front end or a web
interface appliance. For the largest or most critical systems, consideration should be
given to installing a full-featured UMCS as specified in UFGS 25 10 10. This UMCS
should be dedicated to the FCS (e.g. a Level 2D front end) and should reside fully within
the physical security footprint of the critical systems.
F-4.2

Management of Risk

It must always be remembered that there is no perfect solution for cybersecurity for
control systems. Cybersecurity experts often say “there is no such thing as an air gap”.

65

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
While it may be more accurate to say “there are always ways to go around the air gap”,
the intent remains – a determined aggressor will always find a way around, over, or
through the protections put in place. The goal in the design of cybersecurity of control
systems, and critical control systems in particular, is to do whatever is practical to make
this as hard as possible.

APPENDIX G IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR SECURITY CONTROLS
G-1

INTRODUCTION

This Appendix contains guidance to control system designers on the implementation of
security controls for control systems. The focus of this guidance is on LOW impact
systems (L-L-L C-I-A Impact rating) which are being fielded on a DoD installation,
particularly building control systems and utility monitoring and control systems. The CCI
tables in APPENDIX H provide specific breakout of responsibilities by security control
and CCI. The notes in this appendix supplement those CCI tables.
G-2

GENERAL GUIDANCE

G-2.1

Control System versus Standard IT System Terminology

Security controls and CCIs were written for traditional IT systems and many contain
terminology and requirements that are confusing and conflicting when applied to a
control system. For example, “incident” as used in the IR family of security controls
includes all incidents – a broken fan belt is an “incident”, but “flaw” as used in security
control SI-2 only covers security flaws, not operational flaws – an inaccurate sensor is
not a “flaw”.
In most cases, the notes below will help make the application of the security control to a
control system clear. In other cases NIST SP 800-53 should be consulted as it contains
the best definition of the security controls as well as “Supplemental Guidance” that can
assist in the interpretation and application of the CCI to a control system. NIST SP 80082 (section 6.2 of revision 2) also has general information on the security control
families, as well as guidance on the application of the security controls to Industrial
Control Systems, which are a subset of control systems and have similar characteristics
to facility-related control systems.
G-2.2

DoD-Defined Values

Many CCIs have DoD defined values of “all employees”, and many CCIs have DoD
defined values of “all components” or similar where this level of detail is not appropriate
for a LOW impact control system. It will be necessary to re-define (and document)
values for CCIs when the DoD-defined values do not make sense for control systems.
G-2.3

Security Controls Which are “Automatically Met”

Some security controls may be “automatic” in the sense that they have already been
implemented for another information system or control system. A security control that
states “the organization does <something>…” may have already been met as a
requirement for a different authorization for a different system.

68

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Security Controls Applicability by Architecture Level

G-2.4

Many security controls may be difficult or impossible to apply below Level 3 for most
control systems. Note, however, that some system, Electronic Security Systems (ESS)
in particular, may be able to meet many of these security controls below Level 3. For
example, an air handler controller (with a user interface) may have only a 4-character
password, or no password support at all. A door lock on an ESS may have a CAC
reader.
G-2.5

Impact Level Applicability

Only security controls for systems categorized with L-L-L (“LOW impact level”) and MM-M (“MODERATE impact level”) are addressed by this Appendix and the CCI tables in
APPENDIX H. The guidance provided for the baseline security controls is determined
by the C-I-A impact level value for the control system:
•

L-L-L Baseline Security Controls: Guidance is provided for a system
categorized with a LOW impact value. These same security controls are
also required for a system determined to have a MODERATE (or HIGH)
impact level value, but additional security enhancements and
implementation guidance may be required. When applying this guidance
to MODERATE (or HIGH) impact systems, evaluate the guidance to
determine if it applies or must be modified for the system.

•

M-M-M Baseline Security Controls: Guidance is provided for a system
categorized with a MODERATE impact value. These security controls
aren’t used for LOW impact value systems. The guidance may not be the
same for HIGH impact systems (using the same security controls).

The guidance in this Appendix and in the CCI tables in APPENDIX H is primarily
targeted to LOW impact systems which are most capable of being addressed in a
standard fashion. Care must be taken when extrapolating this guidance to systems with
MODERATE or HIGH impact values.

AC-2

Account Management: Specify what account types provide which
permissions in the control system (e.g. “view only”, “acknowledge alarms”,
“change set-points”, etc.). Note that designer may need to explain these
roles to the ISSM / ISSO so they can perform their DoD-defined duties
under this control. Note that “accounts” (and particularly “temporary” or
“emergency” accounts) likely exist at Level 4 and may or may not exist at
Levels 1 or 2, depending on the control system type. (For example, many
building control systems won’t have user accounts at these levels, but
many utility control systems do). Designer may need to explain lack of
“accounts” at Levels 1 and 2. Specifications should require that account
activities be audited (logged), but auditing may be limited to software
applications, and require notification be supported. Note that notification
(e.g. email, rollup to another system) will generally require Platform
Enclave or other Level 4 and Level 5 support for actual execution.

AC-3

Access Enforcement: AC-3 is met by requiring the contractor to configure
any control system component which has a STIG or SRG in accordance
with that STIG or SRG”

AC-4

Information Flow Enforcement: Information flow can be regulated by the
IT organization at the FPOC. Level 2N devices exist that could be used at
Level 2 to regulate flow. Similar Level 1N devices may exist. Include
requirements in the specification that the installing contractor document
necessary communications (to be used for “whitelisting”). If information
flow enforcement at Level 2N is a requirement, include implementation
requirements in the specification.

AC-6

Least Privilege: Within the control system (as opposed to the Platform
Enclave) least privilege should be met by specifications that limit
functionality at the front end by user and roles (e.g., some users can only
viewpoints, others can change values, etc.). Note the DoD definition of
what requires explicit authorization includes (for a control system)
everything – up to and including hardware. This may not be practical.
Designer would need to ensure implementation via project specification
requirements including physical security. Note also that AC-6 (2) requires
that control system operators with access to privileged functions (via login
to a privileged account) have a separate account when accessing nonprivileged functions. This is probably not practical, or desirable for control
system applications when considering the role that operators play (where
it’s impractical to expect an operator to log out and then back in to override
a point, for example).

AC-7

Unsuccessful Logon Attempts: Note that a requirement for a HIGH
availability at the front end may preclude locking out an account for failed
login attempts. This control may be impractical below Level 3 and, even at
Level 4, may only be implemented by login to the OS as a prerequisite for
access to the control system. Designer needs to identify where this can be
supported, and include requirements in the specification where this is
needed.

AC-8

System Use Notification: Login banners must be implemented at user
login to government computers – e.g. at the Platform Enclave, Level 4 and
Level 2 computers. User interfaces at Levels 0, 1 and 2 (e.g. Local
Display Panels (LDP)) generally won’t support a login banner. Require
login banners where practical according to best industry practice and
indicate where implementation is not practical.

AC-11
and
AC-12

Session Lock and Session Termination: The whole notion of a
“session” generally only makes sense at a computer (i.e., Level 4) and for
the computer these controls should be implemented by the operating
system and inherited from the Platform Enclave. At Level 1 and Level 2,
devices generally lack user interfaces. Designers should require that
devices with user interfaces (e.g. LDPs) be password protected and
automatically log out a user after a certain period of inactivity.

Permitted Actions Without Identification Or Authentication: At Level 4,
all actions should require authentication to the (Windows) Operating
System. User interfaces at Level 1 or 2 should be password protected.
Note that this security control is specifically about user actions, not
“processes acting for a user”. In most cases, this is met by virtue of the
user having logged into a computer. Physical security may be required to
deny access to devices and equipment, and can be implemented at
multiple levels through means such as lockable enclosures, tamper
switches, room access control, people trap, and paper access logs.
Some user access (local display panels, Hand-Off-Auto switches, etc.)
may not support authentication and necessary physical security should be
considered. When considering physical security of such devices, it is
generally not beneficial to secure an interface which is co-located with the
controlled equipment without also securing the controlled equipment, as
the equipment would remain vulnerable.

AC-17

Remote Access: Remote access should be covered by the Platform
Enclave (see general notes for AC control family).

AC-18

Wireless Access: Wireless at Level 4 should be provided by the
appropriate IT organization. Avoid wireless to the greatest extent possible
at Levels 1 and 2. Wireless may be considered for retrofits where running
wires would be prohibitive, but other technologies (such as powerline
carrier) should be considered first. When permitting wireless, require
extremely limited range such that signals are not available beyond the
necessary ranges. In many cases Authentication and Encryption support
will be marginal at Levels 1 and 2.

AC-19

Access Control For Mobile Devices: Mobile devices refer to tablets,
phones, etc. These are addressed at the Platform Enclave. When
permitted they may be used as workstations for browser-based clients, or
may be restricted to receiving alerts/notifications from the control system.

AC-20

Use Of External Information Systems: Connections from External
systems, and portable storage, should all be handled at the Platform
Enclave.

Collaboration And Information Sharing: Control systems typically
shouldn’t share information. Any sharing is handled at the Platform

needs to require auditing where possible, and be prepared to justify not auditing where
it is simply impractical. Designer may provide input into what can be audited, where it
can be audited, and what types of information may be gathered. It might make sense

assumption that the control system is “automatically” compliant because of
existing STIGs etc. is completely false below Level 3 and designer may
need to provide justification for the control system not meeting the
standard checklists. As a control system is designed to have regularly
configurable parameters, documentation and approval for all changes to
controllers at Levels 1 and 2 is not practical. Significant architectural
configuration changes should still be documented and approved.

require submittals containing data, documentation and software sufficient
to restore the system to its final accepted as-built state. This must include
custom programming and configuration for controllers or workstations.

CP-12

Safe Mode: The designer should determine, based on the criticality of the
controlled equipment, what conditions to consider and which actions, if
any, the control system should take when these conditions are true. This
should all be specified in the control logic (e.g. sequence of operations), in
particular by addressing normal/failed positions of output devices, and in
the overall system design. Where high reliability is required, the analysis
should consider the addition of redundant equipment to the design. See
also SC-24 and SI-17, and CHAPTER 4.

G-3.6

Identification and Authorization (IA) Control Family

Note that authenticators might be either physical authenticators (e.g., CAC cards,
tokens), non-physical ones (e.g., passwords), or biometrics. While Level 4 (Platform
Enclave) may use any of these, most control systems will not support anything other
than passwords at Level 2 and below – and even password support may only allow for
“weak” passwords (e.g. much of IA-5 will not be supported except at Level 4).
Therefore, DoD defined requirements may not be appropriate at Level 2 or below. Note
that ESS is an exception, ESS will likely support CAC or biometrics - for example a door
swipe. Designer should specify where possible to standard/best industry practice and
be prepared to defend that decision when it does not meet DoD IT-centric standards.

IA-2

Identification And Authentication (Organizational Users): Much of this
can only be met at Level 4, and much of it depends on the computer
operating system. Designer should provide specifications where possible,
and be prepared to justify non-implementation in the control system.
Whenever possible, require that the control system (for access via a
computer) support CAC (or similar) logins. Note that remote access is
covered at the Platform Enclave.

IA-3

Device Identification And Authentication: Much of this can only be met
at Level 4, and much of it depends on the computer operating system.
Typically, authentication between devices can be implemented between
computers (Level 2 and 4) or between network hardware (Level 2, 3 or 4).
Authentication may be supported between controllers, where not all
controllers will support this capability and it will be more often supported at
Level 4 than at Level 2.
In general, device authentication between controllers will not be required,
for LOW impact system, but may be required for MODERATE or HIGH
systems.
Designer should provide specifications requiring authentication where
possible, and be prepared to justify non-implementation in the control
system.

IA-5

IA-6
and
IA-7

Authenticator Management: The DoD-defined password complexity
values may be impractical for control system components to meet. Specify
password complexity at DoD-defined values where practical.
Require that default passwords be changed from defaults, and that
passwords are submitted in a secure manner.. For PKI systems,
certificate paths should be provided by the Platform Enclave.
Authenticator Feedback and Cryptographic Module Authentication:
Almost certainly Platform Enclave only and not supported below that level.
Designer may need to provide input/justification for this.

G-3.7

Incident Response (IR) Control Family

Note that the definition of “incident” includes non-security related failures. A broken fan
belt is an incident, as is a sticking valve, or an out-of-calibration sensor. The designer
may need to provide input to the incident response plan to address any control systemspecific actions. For example, the response to a successful attack on the front end
might be to place equipment in Manual / Hand operation.

Media Transport: CCI-001027 (MP-5 (4)) places a requirement on the
control system, but only when the control system is outside a “controlled
area” where “controlled area” is defined in CCI-001016 as areas approved
for processing the information. By definition, an area must be approved for
processing the information necessary for the control systems in that area.
For transportation outside that area, the data would have to be encrypted
by tools provided by the Platform Enclave.

G-3.10

Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) Control Family

Note that control systems are often distributed, with large portions of the system being
in spaces outside the control of the organization. This impacts many of the PE controls,
in particular PE-16 can only be met for spaces controlled by the organization. In
general, these are met at the Platform Enclave, but implementation may be spotty
below that. Designer should require locked rooms where possible. Level 4, 3, and 2N
equipment should either be in locked rooms or locked enclosures. Level 2, Level 1 and
Level 0 equipment will frequently be located in tenant spaces and outside the control of
the organization. For some systems, it may be necessary to require lockable
enclosures for some controllers at Level 2 and Level 1, but this must be weighed
against the need for maintenance personnel to access the equipment. In general, there
is little benefit in requiring lockable enclosures for controllers when the underlying
equipment is readily accessible from the controller location.
Most of the control system is not in “normal” server spaces. For the normal server
spaces, PE requirements will be met at the Platform Enclave. For the remainder of the
control system, PE requirements (e.g. PE-14’s temperature and humidity requirements)
are either N/A or are covered by design specifications. Note that NIST guidance states
that several PEs (e.g. PE-10, PE-12, PE-13, PE-14, and PE-15) only apply at major
server rooms, not individual components. These are covered by the Platform Enclave
and are N/A in the control system. Design guidance for controls in the Physical and
Environmental Protection (PE) control family is shown in Table G-9.

PE-4

Access Control For Transmission Medium: Designer should require
physical security for network media and may need to coordinate with
electrical designer for conduit requirements. Note that physical security may
be required outside spaces controlled by the organization as well. See SC8.

PE-5

Access Control For Output Devices: Note that “physical outputs” for a
control system correspond to the location of the controlled equipment, which
must also be secured so there are unlikely to be additional requirements for
the control system components

PE-9

Power Equipment And Cabling: For systems requiring redundant power,
designer should coordinate with electrical designer. Note that the weak link
in reliability will often be the controlled equipment. For example, if a single
backup generator is needed, a system with 2 generators - each with a single
controller - will be more reliable than a single generator with redundant
controllers.

PE-11

Emergency Power: Within the control system, require an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS), either in the control system specification or by
coordination with electrical specification, when backup power is required. At
the front end, this could either be met by the Platform Enclave, or by control
system specification requirements also. For the majority of LOW impact
systems, this control will not be implemented.

PE-16

Delivery And Removal: No additional control-specific guidance. Use
general control family guidance preceding this table for this control.

PE-17

Alternate Work Site: PE-17 can’t be applied except at Level 4 – there is no
possible “alternate work site” for PIT. This is all at the Platform Enclave.

PL-2

System Security Plan: While the designer is not directly responsible for the
system security plan itself, the design must provide information to be used in
this plan. For example, the system architecture drawing is part of the
definition of the authorization boundary. The designer may also provide
input for the security categorization since they have the specific knowledge
of the underlying mechanical/electrical systems and can help assess the
impact of those systems on control system tenants

PL-4

Rules Of Behavior: As indicated in CHAPTER 4, social media should be
completely inaccessible from the control system.

PL-7

Security Concept Of Operations: Designer needs to provide input to a
security concept of operations since the range of possible operations is
defined by the underlying equipment, sequences of operation, selection of
controllers, and front end capabilities.

PL-8

Information Security Architecture: System architecture submittals are
necessary inputs to the security architecture. Dependencies on external
services should be minimal, if any.

G-3.12

Program Management (PM) Control Family

Generally, the designer does not get involved in project planning; therefore the PM
controls are not a primary designer responsibility, but designer may need to provide
input to support others.

in Table G-11.

Risk Assessment: The designer is well versed in the control system and
the underlying mechanical / electrical system and may therefore need to
assist in identifying risks to the tenants served by the control system.

RA-5

Vulnerability Scanning: Scanning can be performed at Levels 3 and 4,
and scanning of the control system at this level should be performed by the
Platform Enclave. Scanning below this level – and particularly at Level 1 is problematic at best since typical control systems do not support
scanning, and traditional IT-centric scanning tools will often completely fail
when scanning a controller. Note that scanning tools should be within the
Platform Enclave, scanning from outside the Platform Enclave just opens
up a hole for an attacker. Designer may need to provide input to
organizations attempting to meet RA-5. See SC-7, SI-3

System and Services Acquisition (SA) Control Family

The NIST description of “External information services” (SA-9) makes it clear that it’s an

SA-2

Allocation Of Resources: Designer may need to provide input to this
process. See PM-3

SA-4

Acquisition Process: SA-4 is at least partially met by the designer
incorporating security-specific requirements in the design, including
acceptance testing. Requirements for FIPS PUB 201-2 probably only apply
at the Platform Enclave and designer may need to provide rationale for not
meeting those requirement in the control system. Similarly, many of the
requirements on the developer probably cannot be enforced on a COTS
system. ESS systems may need to meet FIPS PUB 201-2 at Levels 1 and
2.

SA-5

Information System Documentation: Designer should require submittals
providing the documentation which is required by these CCIs. Note that
some of the required documentation may not be obtainable, particularly for
a COTS system.

SA-9

External Information System Services: In general, control systems
should not use external IS, so this control should not apply. Where it does,
it should be addressed at the Platform Enclave.

SA-10
and
SA-11

Developer Configuration Management and Developer Security Testing
And Evaluation: SA-10, SA-11 are likely impossible for COTS systems.
Designer needs to specify what can be specified (which will often require
additional submittals) and explain what can’t be specified. Note that the
control assumes the developer has a role during implementation and/or
operation – this is often not true.

SC-2

Application Partitioning: This is met by separating out computer
administration and by design specifications that require different user
permissions within the control system (e.g. “view data” vs “modify data”).

SC-4

Information In Shared Resources: Typically the control system will all be
dedicated hardware and software, so there are no shared resources. This
control might have some applicability at Level 4 if computer resources are
shared.

SC-5

Denial Of Service Protection: Within the control system, denial of service
attacks are mitigated by designing the system to not depend on the
network. Otherwise, this is a Platform Enclave control.

SC-7

Boundary Protection: Implementation at the external boundary should be
the responsibility of the Platform Enclave. The Platform Enclave can
perform monitoring/traffic control at Level 3, and perhaps key points near
Level 4 assets. Aside from those locations, this control may be difficult to
meet within the control system. Designer may need to provide justification
for not monitoring or controlling traffic below Level 3. It may not be prudent
for the control system to fail to a “secure” state after loss of a boundary
protection device since this allows an attack vector to disable controlled
equipment by taking out the boundary device. Control systems must
continue to run independently when boundary devices are lost. See CP-12
comments and RA-5, SI-3, SC-24

SC-8

Transmission Confidentiality And Integrity: Note that NIST guidance
suggests this only applies to information outside a secure physical
boundary, and that, when this control cannot be met, alternate physical
security safeguards such as a protected distribution system can be
employed.

SC-10

Network Disconnect: Data within a control system is often communicated
without setting up a “session”. Most control systems will not use sessions
other than for communications within Level 4.

SC-12

Cryptographic Key Establishment And Management: Below Level 4,
control systems support for cryptographic keys is extremely limited and it is
impractical to implement many of these controls.

SC-13

Cryptographic Protection: Note that NIST states this control does not
require cryptography, it merely provides requirements for the
implementation of cryptography where it is required. The vast majority of
control systems should not have any information requiring the use of
cryptography (and in the few cases where it is even possible, the designer
should review whether it is really necessary for the control system to have
this information).

SC-15

Collaborative Computing Devices: In general, control systems shouldn’t
use collaborative computing devices

SC-18

Mobile Code: This control can and should be fully applied at Level 4.
Below that, there’s an important distinction between “mobile code” and
“mobile code technologies”: Java is a “mobile code technology” used by
many control systems at Level 2 (and possibly other Levels), but Java
should not be used as “mobile code” – which is code that is downloaded
and executed without explicit user action. So, while mobile code
technologies may be permissible below Level 4, mobile code should not be.
Mobile code restrictions within the control system should be covered by
design specifications.
For example, common building control system products use Java, and
serve web pages to clients. These pages do not constitute mobile code.
Downloading a Java application, however, would be an example of mobile
code.

Resolver) and Architecture And Provisioning For Name / Address
Resolution Service: These controls apply only at the Platform Enclave.

SC-24

Fail In Known State: What is key here is the status of controlled equipment
after a control system failure. Designer should specify this where
necessary. Note that the DoD requirement of a “secure state” may not be
applicable, and would be superseded by a “safe state”, or by a “support the
mission” state. Data preserved through a failure may be limited by the
nature of the control system and designer should specify what is
reasonable. See CP-12.

Flaw Remediation: SI-2 is about security updates and patches for software
and firmware. While this can (and should) be applied at Level 3 and Level
4, this control may be largely “not applicable” or “impractical” below Level 3,
due to both the relative infrequency of available updates and also the
difficulty of patching controllers at Level 1 and 2. This is also largely
irrelevant at Level 1 and 2, since it completely ignores flaws in the
underlying equipment, which are likely to be much more common and much
more significant.

not about operational monitoring of the control system (e.g. viewing
graphics, receiving alarms), but about monitoring for security.

SI-7

Software, Firmware, And Information Integrity: Integrity verification tools
may only be possible at Level 4. Designer should provide input on what is
reasonable based on the control system capabilities, and where this control
is not feasible.

SI-10

Information Input Validation: This could cover network data, sensor input,
or input from a user. Designer could require additional sanity checks on
sensor input, or redundant sensors. User input validation would likely need
to be addressed by policy. Network validation may not be possible except
at Level 4.

APPENDIX H CONTROL CORRELATION IDENTIFIER (CCI) TABLES
H-1

INTRODUCTION

This appendix provides a number of tables which help classify the CCIs for a LOW or
MODERATE system on a DoD installation where there is a separate authorization for
the Platform Enclave and the minimum cybersecurity design requirements have been
followed.
H-2

TABLE STRUCTURE AND CONTENT

Within each table, the following columns are defined. Note that not all tables use all
columns:
•
CCI: The CCI number.
•

NIST SP 800-53 Control Text Indicator: NIST SP 800-53 breaks
individual controls (i.e., single Control IDs) down into multiple elements
and enhancements, where an enhancement is a more stringent
requirement than the base control. The Control Text Indicator uniquely
identifies each of these elements and enhancements. A letter indicates an
element within a control, a number is an enhancement. For example,
“AC-17 (4)(b)” is the second element of the fourth enhancement to AC-17.

•

CCI Definition: The definition of the CCI.

•

Applies At or Above Impact: This CCI should be applied if the control
system impact is this or above.

•

Table Reference: Indicated which other table(s) in this Appendix the CCI
is found in.

•

Applicable to a Control System: Is this CCI applicable to a control
system?

•

Rational for non-inclusion: Reason the CCI is not applicable to control
systems

•

Rational for Removal from a LOW Baseline: Reason the CCI should be
removed from the baseline for a LOW impact control system.

•

Responsibility: Indicates who has responsibility for implementing the
control. One or more of:
•

DoD-Defined: Either the DoD has provided a value for the
“organization selected” values, or the DoD implementation guidance
states that the CCI is already met by existing policy or regulation.
Note that definition or guidance provided may not be relevant for
a control system – the organization definitions were determined
from the perspective of a traditional information system, not for a
control system.

90

•

UFC 4-010-06
19 September 2016
Change 1, 18 January 2017
Designer: The designer has a role to address for this CCI. Either the
designer needs to provide design specifications to cover a
requirement on the control system itself, or the designer must provide
input to others regarding the implementation or lack of feasibility of the
CCI (typically because the CCI was written with an IT system, not a
control system, in mind).

•

Non-Designer: The CCI is beyond the responsibility of the designer,
and is the responsibility of someone else – typically the System
Owner (SO). This does not diminish the importance of these CCIs,
but as these CCIs are not the responsibility of the designer they are
beyond the scope of this UFC.

•

Platform Enclave: The CCI contains a requirement which is assumed
to be implemented at the Platform Enclave and inherited by the
control system, or is mostly implemented at the Platform Enclave but
also needed within the field control system. Note that if there is no
Platform Enclave, then CCIs listed in the “Platform Enclave” category
are instead in the “Non-Designer” category.

•

Impractical: The CCI is impractical to fully implement in a control
system, but may be applied in a limited manner to at least some part
of the control system. Most often CCIs that can be applied to only
part of the control system can be implemented at Level 4 of the
architecture, but would be prohibitively difficult to implement at Levels
1 or 2. Note that “prohibitively” is a judgment based on a typical LOW
control system – for a MODERATE or HIGH system, it may be
worthwhile to implement these controls at all possible levels even if
this adds significant cost and complexity.

H-3

CCI TABLE NOTES

H-3.1

Controls Inherited from Platform Enclave

Note that not all controls that can be inherited from the Platform Enclave have
necessarily been identified as such -- some controls labeled “Non-Designer” may in
fact be implemented at the Platform Enclave and the control system inherits from that.
H-3.2

CCIs in Multiple Tables

Note that some CCIs will appear in multiple tables, typically “Designer and Platform
Enclave” or “Platform Enclave and Other”. For example, scanning (RA-5) should
happen at the Platform Enclave level and not in the control system. But the designer
may need to provide input to the selection of scanning tools appropriate for the control
system. The purpose of these tables is to break down the responsibilities for each
control such that a specific individual/role would not be required to look at all the tables
to determine what needs to be done.

CCI TABLE DESCRIPTIONS

Multiple CCI tables are included in this Appendix, each including CCIs that meet certain
characteristics as described. An electronic version of the CCI tables in Excel format is
available at the RMF Knowledge Service website.
H-4.1

CCI Summary Table

Table H-1 summarizes all the CCIs that can be applied to a MODERATE or lower
control system, based on NIST 800-82. This table also indicates which other tables
each CCI can be found in.
H-4.2

CCI Not Applicable to Control Systems

Table H-2 lists CCIs that (assuming the minimum cybersecurity requirements in
CHAPTER 4 have been met) never apply to a control system, and provides a rationale
for not using them.
H-4.3

CCIs Removed from LOW Impact Control System Baseline

Table H-3 lists CCIs that NIST 800-82 includes in the LOW baseline, but do not apply to
a LOW control system, and provides a rationale. Note that CCIs here are listed as
LOW, but aren’t used at LOW.
H-4.4

Designer CCIs

For a LOW Impact system, use Table H-4 to determine CCIs that should be addressed
in design. For a MODERATE Impact system, use both Table H-4 and Table H-5 to
determine CCIs that should be addressed in design. In many cases, guidance on
addressing specific security controls in design is provided in 0.
H-4.5

Platform Enclave CCIs

Table H-6 lists CCIs in the “Platform Enclave” category that should be applied for a
LOW or MODERATE system. Table H-7 lists CCIs in the “Platform Enclave” category
that should be applied for a MODERATE system (above what is applied for a LOW).
While implementation of the Platform Enclave is not the designer’s responsibility (a key
point of the Platform Enclave is that it is a standard approach that can be implemented
across multiple control systems), those responsible for the Platform Enclave need to be
aware of CCIs that the control system expects to inherit from the Platform Enclave
