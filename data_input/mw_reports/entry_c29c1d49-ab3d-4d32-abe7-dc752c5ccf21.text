Initial Access

T1566 – Phishing:

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can
automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

Adversaries may send
phishing messages to gain
access to victim systems. All
forms of phishing are
electronically delivered social
engineering.

1/15

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion prevention
systems and systems designed
to scan and remove malicious
email attachments or links can
be used to block activity.
M1021 - Restrict Web-Based
Content:
Determine if certain websites or
attachment types (ex: .scr, .exe,
.pif, .cpl, etc.) that can be used
for phishing are necessary for
business operations and
consider blocking access if
activity cannot be monitored well
or if it poses a significant risk.
M1054 - Software Configuration:
Use anti-spoofing and email
authentication mechanisms to
filter messages based on validity
checks of the sender domain
(using SPF) and integrity of
messages (using DKIM).
Enabling these mechanisms
within an organization (through
policies such as DMARC) may
enable recipients (intra-org and
cross domain) to perform similar
message filtering and validation.
[3][4]
M1017 - User Training:
Users can be trained to identify
social engineering techniques
and phishing emails.

2/15

Execution

T1059.001 – Command and
Scripting Interpreter –
PowerShell:
Adversaries may abuse
PowerShell commands and
scripts for execution.
PowerShell is a powerful
interactive command-line
interface and scripting
environment included in the
Windows operating system.

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:
Anti-virus can be used
to automatically
quarantine suspicious
files.

M1045 - Code Signing:
Set PowerShell execution policy
to execute only signed scripts.
M1042 - Disable or Remove
Feature or Program:
It may be possible to remove
PowerShell from systems when
not needed, but a review should
be performed to assess the
impact to an environment, since
it could be in use for many
legitimate purposes and
administrative functions.
Disable/restrict the WinRM
Service to help prevent uses of
PowerShell for remote execution.
M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control where
appropriate.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
When PowerShell is necessary,
restrict PowerShell execution
policy to administrators. Be
aware that there are methods of
bypassing the PowerShell
execution policy, depending on
environment configuration.

3/15

T1059.003 – Windows
Command Shell:

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:

Adversaries may abuse the
Windows command shell for
execution. The Windows
command shell (cmd) is the
primary command prompt on
Windows systems.

Use application control where
appropriate.

T1047 – Windows Management
Instrumentation:

M1040 - Behavior Prevention
on Endpoint:
On Windows 10, enable
Attack Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
processes created by WMI
commands from running.
Note: many legitimate tools
and applications utilize WMI
for command execution.

Adversaries may abuse
Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) to
execute malicious commands
and payloads. WMI is an
administration feature that
provides a uniform environment
to access Windows system
components.
M1038 - Execution Prevention:
Use application control
configured to block execution of
wmic.exe if it is not required for a
given system or network to
prevent potential misuse by
adversaries. For example, in
Windows 10 and Windows
Server 2016 and above,
Windows Defender Application
Control (WDAC) policy rules may
be applied to block the wmic.exe
application and to prevent abuse.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Prevent credential overlap
across systems of administrator
and privileged accounts.

4/15

M1018 - User Account
Management:
By default, only administrators
are allowed to connect remotely
using WMI. Restrict other users
who are allowed to connect, or
disallow all users to connect
remotely to WMI.
Defense Evasion

T1070.001 – Indicator
Removal on Host: Clear
Windows Event Logs:
Adversaries may clear
Windows Event Logs to hide
the activity of an intrusion.
Windows Event Logs are a
record of a computer's alerts
and notifications. There are
three system-defined sources
of events: System,
Application, and Security, with
five event types: Error,
Warning, Information,
Success Audit, and Failure
Audit.

M1041 - Encrypt
Sensitive Information:
Obfuscate/encrypt
event files locally and
in transit to avoid
giving feedback to an
adversary.

M1029 - Remote Data Storage:
Automatically forward events to a
log server or data repository to
prevent conditions in which the
adversary can locate and
manipulate data on the local
system. When possible,
minimize time delay on event
reporting to avoid prolonged
storage on the local system.

5/15

M1022 - Restrict File and
Directory Permissions:
Protect generated event files that
are stored locally with proper
permissions and authentication
and limit opportunities for
adversaries to increase
privileges by preventing Privilege
Escalation opportunities.
T1027.002 – Obfuscated Files or
Information: Software Packing:

M1049 Antivirus/Antimalware:

Adversaries may perform
software packing or virtual
machine software protection to
conceal their code. Software
packing is a method of
compressing or encrypting an
executable. Packing an
executable changes the file
signature in an attempt to avoid
signature-based detection. Most
decompression techniques
decompress the executable code
in memory.

Employ heuristic-based
malware detection. Ensure
updated virus definitions and
create custom signatures for
observed malware.

T1562.001 – Impair Defenses:
Disable or Modify Tools:

M1022 - Restrict File and
Directory Permissions:

Adversaries may modify and/or
disable security tools to avoid
possible detection of their
malware/tools and activities. This
may take the many forms, such
as killing security software
processes or services, modifying
/ deleting Registry keys or
configuration files so that tools
do not operate properly, or other
methods to interfere with security
tools scanning or reporting
information.

Ensure proper process and
file permissions are in place
to prevent adversaries from
disabling or interfering with
security services.

6/15

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions:
Ensure proper Registry
permissions are in place to
prevent adversaries from
disabling or interfering with
security services.
M1018 - User Account
Management:
Ensure proper user permissions
are in place to prevent
adversaries from disabling or
interfering with security services.
Credential Access

T1003.001 – OS Credential
Dumping: LSASS Memory:
Adversaries may attempt to
access credential material
stored in the process memory
of the Local Security Authority
Subsystem Service (LSASS).
After a user logs on, the
system generates and stores
a variety of credential
materials in LSASS process
memory. These credential
materials can be harvested by
an administrative user or
SYSTEM and used to conduct
Lateral Movement using Use
Alternate Authentication
Material.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint:
On Windows 10,
enable Attack Surface
Reduction (ASR)
rules to secure
LSASS and prevent
credential stealing.

7/15

M1043 - Credential Access
Protection:
With Windows 10, Microsoft
implemented new protections
called Credential Guard to
protect the LSA secrets that can
be used to obtain credentials
through forms of credential
dumping. It is not configured by
default and has hardware and
firmware system requirements. It
also does not protect against all
forms of credential dumping.
M1028 - Operating System
Configuration:
Consider disabling or restricting
NTLM. Consider disabling
WDigest authentication.
M1027 - Password Policies:
Ensure that local administrator
accounts have complex, unique
passwords across all systems on
the network.
M1026 - Privileged Account
Management:
Do not put user or admin domain
accounts in the local
administrator groups across
systems unless they are tightly
controlled, as this is often
equivalent to having a local
administrator account with the
same password on all systems.
Follow best practices for design
and administration of an
enterprise network to limit
privileged account use across
administrative tiers.

8/15

M1025 - Privileged Process
Integrity:
On Windows 8.1 and Windows
Server 2012 R2, enable
Protected Process Light for LSA.
M1017 - User Training:
Limit credential overlap across
accounts and systems by
training users and administrators
not to use the same password
for multiple accounts.
Discovery

T1007 – System Service
Discovery:
Adversaries may try to get
information about registered
services. Commands that
may obtain information about
services using operating
system utilities are "sc,"
"tasklist /svc" using Tasklist,
and "net start" using Net, but
adversaries may also use
other tools as well.
Adversaries may use the
information from System
Service Discovery during
automated discovery to shape
follow-on behaviors, including
whether or not the adversary
fully infects the target and/or
attempts specific actions.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

9/15

Collection

T1074.001 – Data Staged:
Local Data Staging:
Adversaries may stage
collected data in a central
location or directory on the
local system prior to
Exfiltration. Data may be kept
in separate files or combined
into one file through
techniques such as Archive
Collected Data. Interactive
command shells may be
used, and common
functionality within cmd and
bash may be used to copy
data into a staging location.

T1560 – Archive Collected Data:

M1047 - Audit:

An adversary may compress
and/or encrypt data that is
collected prior to exfiltration.
Compressing the data can help
to obfuscate the collected data
and minimize the amount of data
sent over the network.
Encryption can be used to hide
information that is being
exfiltrated from detection or
make exfiltration less
conspicuous upon inspection by
a defender.

System scans can be
performed to identify
unauthorized archival utilities.

This type of attack
technique cannot be
easily mitigated with
preventive controls
since it is based on
the abuse of system
features.

10/15

Command and Control

T1071.001 – Application
Layer Protocol: Web
Protocols:
Adversaries may
communicate using
application layer protocols
associated with web traffic to
avoid detection/network
filtering by blending in with
existing traffic. Commands to
the remote system, and often
the results of those
commands, will be embedded
within the protocol traffic
between the client and server.

M1031 - Network
Intrusion Prevention:
Network intrusion
detection and
prevention systems
that use network
signatures to identify
traffic for specific
adversary malware
can be used to
mitigate activity at the
network level.

Protocols such as HTTP and
HTTPS that carry web traffic
may be very common in
environments. HTTP/S
packets have many fields and
headers in which data can be
concealed. An adversary may
abuse these protocols to
communicate with systems
under their control within a
victim network while also
mimicking normal, expected
traffic.
T1573 – Encrypted Channel:
Adversaries may employ a
known encryption algorithm to
conceal command and control
traffic rather than relying on any
inherent protections provided by
a communication protocol.
Despite the use of a secure
algorithm, these implementations
may be vulnerable to reverse
engineering if secret keys are
encoded and/or generated within
malware samples/configuration
files.

M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion detection
and prevention systems that
use network signatures to
identify traffic for specific
adversary malware can be
used to mitigate activity at the
network level.

11/15

M1020 - SSL/TLS Inspection:
SSL/TLS inspection can be used
to see the contents of encrypted
sessions to look for networkbased indicators of malware
communication protocols.
T1219 – Remote Access
Software:

M1038 - Execution
Prevention:

An adversary may use legitimate
desktop support and remote
access software, such as Team
Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein,
AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish
an interactive command and
control channel to target systems
within networks. These services
are commonly used as legitimate
technical support software, and
may be allowed by application
control within a target
environment.

Use application control to
mitigate installation and use
of unapproved software that
can be used for remote
access.

M1037 - Filter Network Traffic:
Properly configure firewalls,
application firewalls, and proxies
to limit outgoing traffic to sites
and services used by remote
access tools.
M1031 - Network Intrusion
Prevention:
Network intrusion detection and
prevention systems that use
network signatures may be able
to prevent traffic to remote
access services.

12/15

Exfiltration

T1567.002 – Exfiltration Over
Web Service: Exfiltration to
Cloud Storage:
Adversaries may exfiltrate
data to a cloud storage
service rather than over their
primary command and control
channel. Cloud storage
services allow for the storage,
edit, and retrieval of data from
a remote cloud storage server
over the Internet.

Impact

T1486 - Data Encrypted for
Impact:
Adversaries may encrypt data
on target systems or on large
numbers of systems in a
network to interrupt
availability to system and
network resources. They can
attempt to render stored data
inaccessible by encrypting
files or data on local and
remote drives and withholding
access to a decryption key.

M1021 - Restrict
Web-Based Content:
Web proxies can be
used to enforce an
external network
communication policy
that prevents use of
unauthorized external
services.

M1040 - Behavior
Prevention on
Endpoint: On
Windows 10, enable
cloud-delivered
protection and Attack
Surface Reduction
(ASR) rules to block
the execution of files
that resemble
ransomware.

M1053 - Data Backup: Consider
implementing IT disaster
recovery plans that contain
procedures for regularly taking
and testing data backups that
can be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure
backups are stored off system
and is protected from common
methods adversaries may use to
gain access and destroy the
backups to prevent recovery.
Consider enabling versioning in
cloud environments to maintain
backup copies of storage
objects.

13/15

T1490 - Inhabit System
Recovery:
Adversaries may delete or
remove built-in operating system
data and turn off services
designed to aid in the recovery of
a corrupted system to prevent
recovery. Operating systems
may contain features that can
help fix corrupted systems, such
as a backup catalog, volume
shadow copies, and automatic
repair features. Adversaries may
disable or delete system
recovery features to augment the
effects of Data Destruction and
Data Encrypted for Impact.

M1053 - Data Backup:
Consider implementing IT
disaster recovery plans that
contain procedures for taking
regular data backups that can
be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure
backups are stored off system
and is protected from
common methods adversaries
may use to gain access and
destroy the backups to
prevent recovery.

M1028 - Operating System
Configuration: Consider technical
controls to prevent the disabling
of services or deletion of files
involved in system recovery.
T1489 - Service Stop:
Adversaries may stop or disable
services on a system to render
those services unavailable to
legitimate users. Stopping critical
services or processes can inhibit
or stop response to an incident
or aid in the adversary's overall
objectives to cause damage to
the environment.

M1030 - Network
Segmentation: Operate
intrusion detection, analysis,
and response systems on a
separate network from the
production environment to
lessen the chances that an
adversary can see and
interfere with critical response
functions.

M1022 - Restrict File and
Directory Permissions: Ensure
proper process and file
permissions are in place to
inhibit adversaries from disabling
or interfering with critical
services.

14/15

M1024 - Restrict Registry
Permissions: Ensure proper
registry permissions are in place
to inhibit adversaries from
disabling or interfering with
critical services.
M1018 - User Account
Management: Limit privileges of
user accounts and groups so
that only authorized
administrators can interact with
service changes and service
configurations.
T1491.001 – Internal
Defacement:
An adversary may deface
systems internal to an
organization in an attempt to
intimidate or mislead users. This
may take the form of
modifications to internal
websites, or directly to user
systems with the replacement of
the desktop wallpaper. Disturbing
or offensive images may be used
as a part of Internal Defacement
in order to cause user
discomfort, or to pressure
compliance with accompanying
messages. Since internally
defacing systems exposes an
adversary's presence, it often
takes place after other intrusion
goals have been accomplished.

M1053 - Data Backup:
Consider implementing IT
disaster recovery plans that
contain procedures for taking
regular data backups that can
be used to restore
organizational data. Ensure
backups are stored off system
and is protected from
common methods adversaries
may use to gain access and
destroy the backups to
prevent recovery.
