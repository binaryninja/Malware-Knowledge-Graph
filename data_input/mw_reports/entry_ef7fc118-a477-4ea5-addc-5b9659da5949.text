Threat Hunting
Managed Defense
Malware
While defending our customers against threats, Mandiant Managed Defense continues to
see new threats that abuse trust in legitimate tools and products to carry out their attacks.
These attacks are effective in getting past security defenses and staying undetected in a
network.

1/14

Through proactive threat hunting, our Managed Defense frontline team uncovered a
campaign that used search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to lead victims to download
the BATLOADER malware for the initial compromise. We also observed a crafty defense
evasion technique using mshta.exe, a Windows-native utility designed to execute Microsoft
HTML Application (HTA) files.
SEO poisoning is an attack method in which threat actors create malicious websites packed
with keywords and use search engine optimization techniques to make them show up
prominently in search results.

Infection Chain
The threat actor used “free productivity apps installation” or “free software development tools
installation” themes as SEO keywords to lure victims to a compromised website and to
download a malicious installer. The installer contains legitimate software bundled with the
BATLOADER malware. The BATLOADER malware is dropped and executed during the
software installation process.
This initial BATLOADER compromise was the beginning of a multi-stage infection chain that
provides the attackers with a foothold inside the target organization. Every stage was
prepared for the next phase of the attack chain. And legitimate tools such as PowerShell,
Msiexec.exe, and Mshta.exe allow proxy execution of malicious payloads to avoid detection.

CVE-2020-1599 Patch Bypass
One notable sample found in the attack chain was a file named, “AppResolver.dll”. This DLL
sample is an internal component of the Microsoft Windows Operating System developed by
Microsoft, but with malicious VBScript embedded inside in a way that the code signature
remains valid. The DLL sample does not execute the VBScript when run by itself. But when
run with Mshta.exe, Mshta.exe locates and executes the VBScript without any issues.
This issue most closely resembles CVE-2020-1599, PE Authenticode signature remains
valid after appending HTA supported scripts signed by any software developer. These
PE+HTA polyglot (.hta files) can be exploited through Mshta.exe to bypass security solutions
that rely on Microsoft Windows code signing to decide if files are trusted. This issue was
patched as CVE-2020-1599.
In this case, we observed arbitrary script data was appended to the signature section beyond
the end of the ASN.1 of a legitimately signed Windows PE file. The resultant polyglot file
maintains a valid signature as long as the file has a file extension other than '.hta'. This
polyglot file will successfully execute the script contents if it is executed with Mshta.exe, as

2/14

Mshta.exe will skip the PE's bytes, locate the script at the end, and execute it. This evasion
technique was used several times during the attack chain to change the host settings and to
launch payloads.
At the latter stages, goodware such as Gpg4win Utility, NSUDO Utility, ATERA, and
SplashTop, are seen installed as part of the attack chain of this campaign. These are to
support remote access, privilege escalation, launching of payloads, encryption, and
persistence. There was also malware such as BEACON, URSNIF deployed to provide
backdoor and credential-stealing capabilities.

An Alternate Infection Chain
Alternatively, the Threat Actor may deploy ATERA directly as the initial compromise.
Similarly, through SEO poisoning, victims were lured to download an ATERA Agent
Installation Package. The installer masquerades as a “free legitimate software” to lure the
victim into installing it onto the host for the initial compromise.
ATERA is a Remote Monitoring Management Software. It provides IT Automation, Host, and
Network Discovery features. SplashTop is software that can be integrated into ATERA is to
provide remote access to a host. The infection chain is as follows:
A user performs a Google search and clicks a link to an actor-created page on a
compromised website (Figure 1).

website
The benign blog post (Figure 2) will abuse a Traffic Direction System (TDS) to decide if
the user should be directed to a webpage that masquerades as a message board that
has posted a download link (Figure 3).

The download link delivers the ATERA Agent Installer Package, named after the search
term. (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

Community Visual Studio 2015 Free.msi” (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Installation of an Atera Agent
After the successful ATERA Agent installation, the Splashtop will be downloaded to the
C:\Windows\Temp directory, and installed on the victim’s host to maintain persistence
(Figure 7 and Figure 8).
After the successful ATERA Agent installation, the ATERA Remote Monitoring &
Management capabilities will push down pre-configured scripts, tools such as
Splashtop Streamer to be installed and run on the victim’s host in a real-time and
automated fashion.

The ATERA Agent will remove itself after the successful Splashtop Streamer
installation. The default configuration of the Splashtop Streamer is set to AutoStart
running in background without security authentication to connect to the victim’s host to
maintain persistence.

Scripts were also pushed down by ATERA Agent to perform malicious task such as
disabling functionalities and adding process and file exclusions for Microsoft Windows
Defender (Figure 9 and Figure 10).

Attribution
In August 2021, a disgruntled CONTI affiliate leaked training documents, playbooks, and
tools used to assist in CONTI ransomware operations. Mandiant has determined that some
of the activity listed above overlaps with techniques in the playbooks disclosed in August.
At this time, due to the public release of this information, other unaffiliated actors may be
replicating the techniques for their own motives and objectives. These victims seem to
operate in a wide range of industries. The threat group's motivations are currently unknown,
but we suspect that the group is financially motivated based on the seemingly industryagnostic leading to ransomware activity.
