Dark Covenant:
Connections Between the Russian
State and Criminal Actors

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA

Key Judgments

This report examines the unspoken connections between the
Russian Federation (in the form of Russian intelligence services or the
Kremlin) and cybercriminals in Russia and Eastern Europe. Sources
include the Recorded Future® Platform as well as other dark web and
open sources. The report will be of interest to threat researchers, as well
as law enforcement, government, and defense organizations.

Executive Summary
​The intersection of individuals in the Russian
cybercriminal world and officials in the Russian
government, typically from the domestic law enforcement
or intelligence services, is well established yet highly
diffuse. The relationships in this ecosystem are based
on spoken and unspoken agreements and comprise fluid
associations.
Recorded Future identified 3 types of links between
the Russian intelligence services and the Russian
criminal underground based on historical activity and
associations, as well as recent ransomware attacks:
direct links, indirect affiliations, and tacit agreement.
Even in cases with discernible, direct links between
cybercriminal threat actors and the Russian state,
indirect affiliations suggest collaboration, and a lack of
meaningful punitive actions shows either a tolerance for,
or tacit approval of, these efforts. This assessment takes
into account that the Russian government possesses
a robust surveillance apparatus and interfaces with
cybercriminal elements and therefore has visibility into,
if not control over, many of the resources used by these
threat actors and can shut them down if they so desire.

CTA-RU-2021-0909

• Based on historical activity, it is highly likely
that Russian intelligence services and law
enforcement have a longstanding, tacit
understanding with criminal threat actors;
in some cases, it is almost certain that the
intelligence services maintain an established
and systematic relationship with criminal threat
actors, either through association or recruitment.
• Precedent suggests that such activities and
associations will almost certainly continue for the
foreseeable future; however, these associations
will likely adapt to provide greater plausible
deniability and fewer overt, direct links between
both groups.
• The open assertion made by US President Joe
Biden that Russian cybercriminals are protected
by the Russian government has placed Russian
President Vladimir Putin on the defensive,
forcing Russian domestic law enforcement to
demonstrate that they are cracking down on
ransomware operators.
• Following the disappearance of ransomware
operators like REvil, we see other groups
emerging in their stead and publicly committing
to reforming their operations, including the
refusal to attack critical infrastructure targets,
which may be seen as a preliminary sign that the
Biden administration’s ultimatum to Russia has
been successful, but it is still too early to gauge
how great its long-term effect will be.   
• If the Biden administration can persuade the
Kremlin that bringing cybercriminal activity under
some form of control is in their best interest — by
granting sanctions relief, increased collaboration,
or economic agreements — these immediate
reforms may be substantive and long-lasting.​

In 2017, while incarcerated in Russia, Kozlovsky himself
claimed that while he worked for FSB, specifically under Dmitry
Dokuchaev, he was responsible for the 2016 hack and leak
operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee
(DNC) in the US. Furthermore, Kozlovsky stated that hackers
supervised by the FSB used a new method of spreading
ransomware, which consisted of “infecting one computer on

since made several claims about working for the FSB under the
guidance of Dokuchaev, and possibly others. Unlike most major
cybercrime groups, Lurk primarily targeted victims inside Russia,
causing speculation about why they felt safe doing so. According
to Novaya Gazeta, a Russian independent news outlet, Kozlovsky
claimed that Dokuchaev had ordered Lurk to target entities
within Russia, such as entities owned by Evgeny Prigozhin, a
close associate of Vladimir Putin and reported founder of Russian
troll farms and the private military company Wagner. Kozlovsky
suggested that such activity would benefit the FSB and enable
them to conduct arrests and gain greater authority; however,
such claims have not been confirmed.

Some of the ways that these criminal efforts have benefited
Kremlin interests include targeting Kremlin opponents with
malicious activities against Estonia, Georgia, Ukraine, and
Western countries as well as providing tools, infrastructure, and
access to the Russian government and intelligence agencies
both wittingly and unwittingly. Russian intelligence agencies
have used criminal commodity malware to obfuscate their
activities and make attribution more difficult. They have used
criminal money laundering networks and bulletproof hosting to
obfuscate the movement of funds and sponsorship of disruptive
activities. They have also used networks compromised for
criminal purposes to search for sensitive data and credentials
to advance espionage activities and targeting against both
domestic opposition and Western entities and governments. The
following sections outline some of the individuals involved in
activities and operations that we believe were either sanctioned
or co-opted in some way by the Russian state.

Evgeny Nikulin
Evgeny Nikulin has been active since at least 2012 when,
according to a charging document from the US District Court of
the Northern District of California, he “engaged in a sustained
campaign to steal user account credentials from major US
companies’’ including LinkedIn, DropBox, and Formspring.
Nikulin obtained LinkedIn user credentials by gaining access
to a personal computer used by a LinkedIn employee who
subsequently used the same computer to log in to LinkedIn
company network resources via a virtual private network (VPN).
Although the initial intrusion vector was not specified in the
charging document, the court documentation indicated that a
DropBox employee was targeted similarly via a spearphishing
attack from the email addresses chinabig01[@]gmail[.]com and
R00talka[@]gmail[.]com, which an FBI investigation linked to
Nikulin as well as to the LinkedIn and Formspring activity. After
gaining access to the user data from the targeted companies,
Nikulin monetized the access by either posting the encrypted
material to forums or negotiating the sale of the material to other
Russian hackers. Beyond the value the information holds for sale
to other Russian hackers on the black market, we assess that the
value of this information to Russian intelligence services is also
high; however, it is not publicly known whether Nikulin attempted
to broker such a sale of these datasets to government agents.

Vinnik and BTC-e are of relevance to the Russian intelligence
services given that bitcoin analysis firm Elliptic traced the use
of bitcoin by GRU-linked advanced persistent threat (APT)
group APT28 “to a number of sources including BTC-e”. APT28
employed cryptocurrency to purchase infrastructure, such as
domains, lease servers, and VPN accounts that were then used
in targeted intrusion operations, such as the one which impacted
the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016, according to a
2018 DoJ indictment. Bolstering the likelihood of this connection,
the Russian government put up an extensive legal effort to fight
the US request for extradition, going as far as quickly opening
a case against Vinnik in Russia and requesting his extradition
there to stand trial.

Alexander Vinnik  
In July 2017, the DoJ issued an indictment against Alexander
Vinnik, claiming that BTC-e, a cryptocurrency exchange that
he established in 2011 and maintained access to, facilitated
“numerous ransomware and other cybercriminal activity”.
Reporting indicates that BTC-e was run out of several locations,
including Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Seychelles and was “heavily
reliant on the criminal underworld and people and entities
interested in anonymity or hard-to-trace transactions”. Vinnik
was arrested by authorities in Greece in conjunction with the
indictment in the US. Additionally, the DoJ indicated that they
had seized BTC-e infrastructure citing its links to cybercriminal
activity as well as the allegation that Vinnik received funds from
the 2014 intrusion of the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox.

Ultimately, whether or not there are connections between
Russian authorities and cybercriminals becomes a moot point.
Cybercriminals are widely known both inside Russia and abroad,
and aside from pursuing the few individuals who have targeted
entities inside Russia or who have crossed some sort of political
line, Russian authorities have done little to try to disrupt the
Russian-language criminal ecosystem. The Kremlin’s muted
response to cybercriminal activities originating from within Russia
has nurtured an environment where cybercriminal organizations
are well-organized enterprises. Until the Russian government
decides to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals operating
in Russia, it will continue to be a safe haven.
Tacit agreements occur when the Russian criminal hacking
ecosystem conducts activity independent of any directive by
the state. This type of activity, and its timing, are consistent
with Russian government strategic goals; although, there are
no direct or indirect links within these efforts. The Russian
government forms a tacit agreement between the individuals
conducting the attacks by not prosecuting them so long as they
target “the right” entities and do not harm Kremlin interests.

Malware That Looks Like Ransomware  
Tacit links also occur when state-sponsored activity
employs malware that looks like ransomware to provide plausible
deniability, or complicate attribution, for cyber operations that
benefit the state. These are not direct links as it is not clear
whether the individuals employing this malware are members
of the cybercriminal ecosystem, but the malware itself certainly
takes its appearance or code framework from cybercriminal
sources. It is not indirect as it is not the sharing of a criminal
resource for state benefit. Rather, this tactic is emblematic of the
state’s tacit approval of the cybercriminal ecosystem.

The use of commodity malware by Russian intelligence
services almost certainly allows the Russian government to
maintain plausible deniability 7 in targeted intrusions, especially
when nuances between the details of specific variants of malware
are used. In addition to modifying and using commodity malware
like BlackEnergy, Sandworm has also been linked to other
intrusions which employed modified versions of ransomware in
order to conduct disruptive and destructive intrusions. The most
widely known examples of this type of activity include a series of
attacks against systems in Ukraine in 2017 designed to look like
ransomware; these attacks employed XData, FakeCry, PSCrypt,
and NotPetya malware. The discovery of these tools as part of
a likely state-sponsored operation, as opposed to a financially
motivated one, was realized when researchers discovered that
payments for advertised decryption tools associated with these
attacks were either impossible to complete or had no effect.

In a June 14, 2021 interview with NBC News, Russian president Vladimir Putin
contradicted the claim that Russia engaged in cyber attacks against US targets,
stating “We have been accused of all kinds of things … Election interference,
cyberattacks and so on and so forth. And not once, not once, not one time,
did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof. Just unfounded
accusations”.

Appendix A: Additional Information on Direct and Indirect Links
Dmitry Dokuchaev
Dokuchaev was born in Kamensk-Uralskiy, Russia in 1984 and developed his interest and skills in computer programming
and network systems administration until eventually specializing in computer and network intrusions. In early 2006, Dokuchaev
served as an editor at the Russian technology magazine “Hacker” under the supervision of Nikita Kislitsin. 8 Dokuchaev, who is
reported to have engaged in carding, admitted that such activity was not without its risks, claiming that authorities in Russia were
cracking down mercilessly on those engaging in this type of criminal activity domestically. Although Dokuchaev did not say when
he conducted those initial intrusions against small local networks, what is known is that Dokuchaev later graduated to statesponsored attacks to deliver malware to targeted hosts abroad, including in the US and other Western countries.
“ВЧК-ОГПУ”, a Russian-speaking Telegram channel with 162,000 subscribers and website rucriminal[.]info, explained to their
readers details of Dokuchaev’s case:
To understand the story of how Dmitry Dokuchaev, an employee of the Information Security Center of the FSB
of the Russian Federation, was immediately accused of treason in Russia and at the same time of cybercrime in the
United States, one must carefully study the indictments. But only not the one in the United States, although there are
interesting moments there, but to carefully study the indictments of hackers whom the FBI arrested after the arrest of
Dokuchaev in Moscow. And also to study the documents of the trial of the hacker Kozlovsky in Yekaterinburg and the
confrontation around the stolen money of the WEX crypto exchange and the programmer Vinnik. All these cases are
connected with each other by one person - Dokuchaev.
From the documents of the United States it becomes clear that Dokuchaev had a small army of hackers, and with
many he became close friends even before he got into the FSB. This army made obscene money (hundreds of millions
of dollars) from cybercrime both outside Russia and in Russia. Members of this army and hackers Nikulin, Kislitsyn,
and, for example, two Ukrainian hackers, who were put on the wanted list by the United States a week ago. This army
rallied back in Yekaterinburg, its members from there moved together to Moscow. From the American documents on
Kislitsyn and Nikulin, it is clear that another member of their inner circle was Oleg Tolstykh. This person subsequently
pelted the Web with documents of strange content and then went into the shadows. Konstantin Kozlovsky and his
Lurk gang were from the same army. He just did not go to Moscow, stayed to work, and specialized in hacking nonWestern and Russian banks. There were at least six bands like Lurk. And they all cleaned out the banks. And at the
head of the army was Dokuchaev.
Kozlovsky, unlike other army men, was initially more independent, although he was also Dokuchaev’s connection.
Kozlovsky has an interesting point in the case - the real hacker (MEG), who broke Sberbank and other banks, turned
out to be an agent of the TsIB (CIB) of the FSB of the Russian Federation. The activities of Lurk became a reason for
Sberbank to invest a billion dollars under the leadership of the head of the Central Information Security Service of
the FSB Sergei Mikhailov in the creation of BiZone (protection against cyber threats and testing of the bank’s security
systems).
This entire army is members of a number of famous online cyber crime forums - exploit.in, MAZA.la and Zloy. These
forums grew on the foundation of the Carder Planet forum of Ukrainian Dmitry Golubev (Script, leader of the Internet
party of Ukraine) after the closure of his project. Therefore, the army was originally Russian-Ukrainian. Controlling
the forums means controlling all cybercrime to some degree. And these forums were under the control of the CIB,
Dokuchaev answered specifically. The forums were in the shadows - because it was beneficial for the CIB to keep
them in the shadows.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA

Ruslan Stoyanov, a former MVD and “Kaspersky Lab” employee, who was convicted for treason charges together with
Dokuchaev and Mikhailov, made a public statement after his conviction:
There is a huge temptation for “decision makers” to use ready-made solutions to Russian cybercrime in order to influence
geopolitics.
The worst scenario is to give cybercriminals immunity from retaliation for stealing money in other countries in exchange
for intelligence. If this happens, a whole layer of “patriotic thieves” will appear, violating the principles of the rule of law and
the inevitability of punishment.
The appearance of such people will immediately give rise to a new subculture. Through underground forums, the
phenomenon will be romanticized and generate a wave of followers almost uncontrolled by the state and by nature inclined
towards anonymity.
It is difficult to steal from international financial organizations, and our talents, having failed there, will turn their attention
to where everything is in Russian, throwing away all the patriotic fervor. We will get a new wave of crimes in Russia. That is,
everything that we have fought for over the past 5 years will pass to dust.
In late 2016, Major Dmitry Dokuchaev, by this point a senior officer of the FSB’s Second Operational Management Department
of Center for Information Security, was arrested by Russian law enforcement and subsequently convicted of high treason. The
treason charges stemmed from claims that Dokuchaev, along with other suspects, transferred data about an individual engaging
in financially motivated threat activity to US intelligence officials. In April 2018, Dokuchaev signed a pre-trial agreement accepting
a conditional guilty plea in relation to charges relating to the transfer of data about financially motivated intrusion actors and was
sentenced to 6 years in prison on high treason. On May 13, 2021, the Lefortovo Court of Moscow released Dokuchaev on parole.

Konstantin Kozlovsky
A first-person account, by Kozolvsky, of activity he conducted on behalf of the FSB via the Russian-language publication
The Insider:
“Being engaged in computer technology, I communicated on numerous Internet forums. In 2008, I entered into a dialogue
about vulnerabilities in email services. During the discussion, I started a dispute for $ 500. as a result of which I demonstrated
the vulnerability using the example of one email, having posted the password for public viewing in the forum. Then I demanded
money from the disputant, offering to meet. In the established place, 2 people approached me. Having determined that I am
the person who hacked the mail, they showed me an FSB officer’s ID and persistently asked me to get into the car.
I was brought, as I later found out, to the courtyard of the FSB headquarters in the Sverdlovsk region (Yekaterinburg). I
spent two days in a room 3 by 3 meters. No food was given. Only 2 times water in an aluminum bowl. A bucket was brought in
to cope. FSB officers gave a choice: work with them or send them to prisons for hacking mail. I agreed by signing the paper.
Over the years of cooperation, I have completed many assignments. Ilya is my curator (later at the trial he will indicate
that he meant FSB officer Dmitry Dokuchaev. - editor’s note) gave tasks and supervised me, supplied me with hardware and
software. patronized in matters with law enforcement.
In recent years, the focus has been on the servers in America and the EU. The instructions for hacking the National
Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States, Hillary Clinton’s correspondence, I successfully completed, transferring
the data on the hard drive to the FSB officer Ilya (850 GB compressed with videos of the hacking).”
According to Kozlovsky, he worked for Dokuchaev and the FSB since 2008, when he was apprehended by the FSB for gaining
unauthorized access to an email account, and that since 2008, he had performed numerous tasks for the agency. Kozlovsky also
claims that the creation of the Lurk and WannaCry viruses were supervised by employees of FSB and that Dokuchaev and others
with access to the viruses “could independently work with infected targets”. Such a statement appears to undermine Kozlovsky’s
credibility or understanding of Russian state-sponsored operations, given that WannaCry is publicly attributed to North Korean
nation-state threat actors.

In October 2020, Kozlovsky was released from the Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, though some of his activities, such
as using internet and phone services, were restricted. Following his release, Kozlovsky traveled to Moscow, but on March 18, 2021,
the Kirov District Court of Ekaterinburg repealed the decision and sent Kozlovsky back to the pre-trial detention center claiming
that Kozlovsky is a flight risk. On March 29, 2021, during a court hearing Kozlovsky gave his wife a note which said that he is under
“immense psychological pressure” and that he does not wish to commit suicide. A similar note was given to Kozlovsky’s mother
which noted he wants to live but might be killed. After Kozlovsky shared the notes with his family, he was transferred to the
medical building of the pre-trial detention center for an evaluation. The results of the medical examination were not made public.

Pavel Vrublevsky
Pavel Vrublevsky (who also operated under the sobriquet “RedEye”), rose to prominence in the early 2000s as the co-creator
of the online payment service ChronoPay. According to Vrublevsky in an interview with Recorded Future’s The Record, ChronoPay
was initially created to act as a payment gateway for several of his unspecified “entertainment projects”, and later grew to include
such partners 9 as “state-owned Rostelecom, Mosenergo, the Russian telecom operator MTS, and the Russian airline Transaero”.
Both Forbes and Russian-language media outlet TAdvisor10 state that Vrublevsky worked closely with Leonid Terekhov, an alleged
former member of the Russian military intelligence apparatus, the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate).
In 2013, Vrublevsky was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for soliciting operators of a botnet to conduct a DDoS attack
against a major ChronoPay competitor, Assist. The attack resulted in serious service disruption, preventing the Russian state-run
airline, Aeroflot, from selling tickets “for several days, costing the company millions of dollars”. Vrublevsky is also accused of having
run a large spam botnet, Rx-Promotion, based on leaked ChronoPay emails “showing ChronoPay executives passing credentials
to Rx-Promotion’s administrative back end database”.
Pavel Vrublevsky openly criticized Dokuchaev and his supervisor, Sergei Mikhailov, for harboring cybercriminals: “the whole
crowd of hackers, including their curators, all together were essentially forum guys from the same forums: Exploit, Maza, and
Zloy, which in turn seem to be stupidly owned by Dokuchaev.”  Pavel Vrublevsky continues: “Historically, not the smartest guys in
uniform who earned money from these “themes” originate in the same forums and in the same communities that were supervised
by Major Dokuchaev from the FSB CIB: Maza, Verified, Exploit.”

Roman Seleznev
Seleznev operated carding forums, such as bulba[.]cc and Track2[.]name, until 2011, when he was a victim of a terrorist attack
in Marrakesh, Morocco. The attack left Seleznev in a coma from which he recovered towards the end of 2012. The marketplace
stopped operating a few months after Seleznev fell into a coma, citing a lack of new stolen material.
After recovering, Seleznev returned to carding, operating under the username “2Pac”. He created another carder marketplace,
this time allowing for other hackers to sell information on his platforms.  He has also created a website, called POS Dumps, with
the intention of teaching carding to new hackers. The website offered a step-by-step guide on how to commit credit card fraud,
providing links for necessary tools.

Alexey Stroganov
In the 2003 arrest of the criminal ring, Stroganov was one of 3 key players, along with the ringleader Artur Lyashenko “Bigbuyer”
and manager Gerasim Selivanov “Gabrik”. Although Stroganov was sentenced to 6 years in prison in 2006, flint24 continued his
criminal activities from behind bars and upon release in 2008, Stroganov had established a criminal distribution network for
compromised credit card data.
While Stroganov appears to have maintained ties with government figures like Dengin for years without backlash, his public
affiliation with President Putin’s judo gym likely crossed a line. The motives and decision-making process behind Stroganov’s
second arrest are not public, but the timing of his award as a Turbostroitel board member followed by the FSB’s unusual, highprofile cybercrime arrests on Stroganov’s birthday indicates that his political overreach triggered a severe backlash from those
close to the Russian president, resulting in Stroganov’s second arrest.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | RUSSIA

In March 2020, the FSB arrested 30 members of a hacker ring. These members were scattered across 11 regions of Russia and
included citizens of Ukraine and Lithuania. According to the Russian media, the hackers specialized in selling compromised debit
and credit cards stolen from both Russian and foreign citizens. During the arrest, authorities uncovered over $1 million USD, 3
million rubles, gold bars, computers, servers that were used to host dark web marketplaces, counterfeit ID cards (including Russian
passports and government IDs), and weapons. Alexey Stroganov was among the arrested hackers and was associated with the
GoldenShop and BuyBest credit card shops. Stroganov’s arrest has been officially confirmed by the Moscow General Judicial Court.
“My opinion is that there are only two options as to why they could have been taken now. First, they worked on Russian targets.
Perhaps, they could not resist something “tasty” or did not control their partners, and as a result, working on .ru became a fact
unpleasant for them. The second option - they violated an agreement with the FSB or refused to perform some important tasks,
or the task, in general, went too far. These are all guesses, but I see no other reason”, an unidentified hacker is quoted as saying
in a conversation with Meduza.

Evgeny Nikulin
Open-source, Russian-language reporting cited Yegor Krasnoborov, 1 of Nikulin’s purported associates, as suggesting that
Nikulin was always interested in technology and computers. Krasnoborov claimed that the Russian government would be able to
somehow rescue Nikulin, suggesting that the charges against the hacker are geopolitically motivated and that despite Nikulin
being a highly skilled hacker capable of committing the intrusions, he was “not a member of any hacker groups and acted alone”.
Yevgeniy Nikulin was convicted in July 2020 for the intrusions against LinkedIn, Formspring, and Dropbox. Later, on September
29, 2020, Nikulin was sentenced to 88 months in prison for breaching several technology firms, capping a drawn-out legal battle
that has involved competing extradition attempts, luxury sports cars, and delays due to the coronavirus outbreak. According to
the US Attorney for the Northern District of California David Anderson, “Nikulin’s conviction is a warning to would-be hackers,
wherever they may be. Computer hacking is not just a crime, it is a direct threat to the security and privacy of Americans. American
law enforcement will respond to that threat regardless of where it originates”.

Pyotr Levashov
Despite the seeming tongue-in-cheek postings in underground forums, Levashov was also known to align himself with, or
openly support, Kremlin interests. In his 2019 book “Intrusion: A Brief History of Russian Hackers”, Danil Turovsky indicated that
in 2012, Levashov engaged in a campaign of harassment surrounding Russian presidential candidate Mikhail Prokhorov and in
2014, as the Russian government supported the conflict in Ukraine, Levashov offered 30% discounts to send spam to “Ukraine,
the USA, nations in the EU and ‘others who imposed sanctions’” on Russia.  
In early April 2017, Levashov was arrested in Barcelona, Spain and the Kelihos botnet was seized. Levashov was subsequently
indicted by the US District of Connecticut District Court. According to the DoJ, in September 2018, “Levashov entered into a guilty
plea, thus admitting in open court to his criminal conduct and avoiding the need for a trial”. Later in December 2018, the DoJ
charged Levashov with “one count of causing intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of conspiracy, one count of
accessing protected computers in furtherance of fraud, one count of wire fraud, one count of threatening to damage a protected
computer, two counts of fraud in connection with email and one count of aggravated identity theft”. During his extradition process
from Spain, Levashov’s wife Maria made claims that US law enforcement was questioning Levashov about his involvement with
Russian nation-state cyber efforts against the West.
On July 20, 2021, a US judge sentenced Peter Levashov to 33 months, time served, and 3 years of supervised release for
creating and operating Kelihos, 1 of the largest spam botnets that ever existed. The judge also ordered that Levashov would have
his computer monitored during the supervised release to prevent the former malware coder from engaging in new illegal activities.

Evgeniy Bogachev
The GameOver Zeus activity was not the only financially motivated activity conducted by Bogachev. According to a 2014
DoJ indictment, he also operated Cryptolocker ransomware, which “infected more than 234,000 computers, with approximately
half of those in the United States. One estimate indicates that more than $27 million in ransom payments were made in just the
first two months since Cryptolocker emerged”. As of this writing, it is unclear if Bogachev remains active in conducting financially
motivated intrusion activity or what type of relationship, if any, he may maintain with the Russian government. At least 1 sensitive
source has claimed Bogachev has been involved in financing Kremlin-backed disinformation efforts against the West.

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy
Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat
actors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China,
Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals —
individuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China,
Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and
where possible, attributing them to nation state government,
organizations, or affiliate institutions.

ADVERSARY

Our coverage includes:
•

•

Government organizations and intelligence
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners,
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and
individual threat actors

INFRASTRUCTURE

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nationstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many
other industry established groups

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established
and named by Recorded Future

•

Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,
persistent commodity malware

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group
or campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically
have data corresponding to at least three points on the
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity
using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21
where the activity is new and significant but doesn't map
to existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged
into an established activity group. We tie this to a threat
actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,
or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary
data. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that
nation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be
added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
