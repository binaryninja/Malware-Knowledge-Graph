Our story starts with a FireEye report: Poison Ivy – Assessing Damage and Extracting
Intelligence. Although the report focuses on the Poison Ivy tool, which has been used by a
number of groups, it specifically highlights a number of campaigns known to use it. One of
those campaigns is the menuPass group, another name for APT10.
Zheng Yanbin
The report contains a number of e-mail addresses associated with domain names used by
the APT10 actors. One of those e-mail addresses, zhengyanbin8@gmail.com, contains a
name – Zheng Yanbin.
Zheng Yanbin is hard to identify from social media, but the e-mail address is associated with
a number of other domains
100fanwen.com
anpvrn.com
architectisusa.com
cmdnetview.com
gostudyantivirus.com
gostudymbaa.com
have8000.com

qt4study.com
qtsofta.com
radiorig.com
redforlinux.com
tomorrowforgood.com
ubuntusofta.com
workerisgood.com
woyaofanwen.com
Many of these domains are associated with addresses in Guangdong, China. A number also
feature in commercial threat intelligence reporting, further confirming Zheng Yanbin’s long
term connection with APT10. The cmdnewview[.]com domain referenced in our previous
article was key evidence used by Palo Alto Networks to link old APT10 activity to the Cloud
Hopper campaign.
This evidence indicates that Zheng Yanbin may be located in Guandong, although social
media accounts identified using the same zhengyanbin8 username, seem to point to an
individual in Shandong. It is not yet clear whether the zhengyanbin8 in Shandong is the
same individual as the APT10 connected hacker.

In summary, an individual using the name Zheng Yanbin was certainly associated with
APT10 and was involved in purchasing or managing C2 infrastructure used by the
group.
