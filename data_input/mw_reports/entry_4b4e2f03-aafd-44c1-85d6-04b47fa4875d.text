A Chinese-speaking threat actor has deployed a new backdoor in multiple cyber-espionage
operations spanning roughly two years and targeting military organizations from Southeast
Asia.
For at least a decade, the hacking group known as Naikon has actively spied on
organizations in countries around the South China Sea, including the Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, for at least a decade, since 2010.
Naikon is likely a state-sponsored threat actor tied to China, mostly known for focusing its
efforts on high-profile orgs, including government entities and military orgs.

During their attacks, Naikon abused legitimate software to side-load the second-stage
malware dubbed Nebulae likely used to achieve persistence, according to research
published today by security researchers at Bitdefender's Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab.
Nebulae provides additional capabilities allowing attackers to collect system information,
manipulate files and folders, download files from the command-and-control server, and
execute, list, or terminate processes on compromised devices.
The malware is also designed to gain persistence by adding a new registry key to relaunch
automatically on system restarts after login.
"The data we obtained so far tell almost nothing about the role of the Nebulae in this
operation, but the presence of a persistence mechanism could mean that it is used as
backup access point to victim in the case of a negative scenario for actors," Bitdefender
researcher Victor Vrabie said.

First-stage backdoor used as a swiss-army knife
In the same series of attacks, the Naikon threat actors also delivered first-stage malware
known as RainyDay or FoundCore used to deploy second-stage payloads and tools used for
various purposes, including the Nebulae backdoor.
"Using the RainyDay backdoor, the actors performed reconnaissance, uploaded its reverse
proxy tools and scanners, executed the password dump tools, performed lateral movement,
achieved persistence, all to compromise the victimsâ€™ network and to get to the information of
interest," Vrabie added [PDF].
Besides deploying additional payloads on compromised systems, attackers can also send
RainyDay commands over TCP or HTTP to manipulate services, access a command shell,
uninstall the malware, taking and collecting screen captures, and manipulate, download, or
upload files.

During attacks observed between June 2019 and March 2021, Naikon dropped malicious
payloads using side-loading and DLL hijacking vulnerabilities impacting:
Sandboxie COM Services (BITS) (SANDBOXIE L.T.D)
Outlook Item Finder (Microsoft Corporation)
VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task Properties (McAfee, Inc.)
Mobile Popup Application (Quick Heal Technologies (P) Ltd.)
ARO 2012 Tutorial
Bitdefender confidently attributed this operation to the Naikon threat actor based on
command-and-control servers and malicious payloads belonging to the Aria-Body loader
malware family used in the group's past operations.
