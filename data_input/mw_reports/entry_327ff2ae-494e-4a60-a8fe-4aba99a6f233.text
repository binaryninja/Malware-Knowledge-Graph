After breaching servers managed by the cybercriminals, security researchers found a
connection between Conti ransomware and the recently emerged Karakurt data
extortion group, showing that the two gangs are part of the same operation.
The Conti ransomware syndicate is one of the most prolific cybercriminal groups today that
operates unabated despite the massive leak of internal conversations and source code that
a hacking group already used to cripple Russian organizations.
Karakurt is a gang active since at least June 2021 that focuses on stealing data from
companies and forcing them into paying a ransom by threatening to publish the information.
More than 40 organizations have fallen victim to Karakurt in about two months, between
September and November 2021.

Cybercriminal infrastructure pwned
The connection between the two groups was possible after security researchers gained
access to an internal Conti VPS server with credentials for a user they believe to be the
leader of the entire syndicate.
Logging into the server was possible after the researchers breached the threat actor's
ProtonMail account and found the necessary access credentials.

When researchers accessed the VPS server, it stored more than 20TB of data that Conti
stole from their victims before deploying the encryption stage of the attack.
Security researchers at Infinitum Turkey-based security consulting company Infinitum IT say
that the VPS server is hosted by Inferno Solutions, a provider in Russia that supports
anonymous payment methods and accepts orders over VPN and TOR connections.
At the same time, Inferno Solutions claims that they “don't tolerate spammers, scammers or
cybercriminals,” that they always side with the client, and that they “do not disturb clients in
case of dubious and unlawful complaints (abuse).”

In a recent report, Infinitum IT details that they were able to gain access to Conti’s
infrastructure when the Conti leaks started, on February 27, after logging into multiple
ProtonMail and Mega storage accounts used by one Conti member.
“At the beginning of Conti leak on February 27, 2022, we are able to get inside multiple
Protonmail and Mega Upload accounts used by one of the key members of Conti
Ransomware group” - Infinitum IT
Once inside the email accounts, the researchers observed incoming emails from Inferno
Solutions hosting provider, which allowed them to gain remote access to the VPS server’s
administration panel.

The analysis of the information on the storage server revealed that Conti had data with an
older timestamp belonging to victims that have not been disclosed publicly. Infinitum IT
contacted the victims to return the stolen data.
The researchers noticed that the Conti member whose accounts they breached was using
the FileZilla FTP client to connect to multiple servers for uploading and downloading stolen
data.
One connection was to the IP address 209[.]222[.]98[.]19, which is where the Karakurt
extortion group hosted their site where they published stolen data from non-paying victims.
BleepingComputer learned months ago from Vitali Kremez of Advanced Intelligence that
Karakurt is a side business of the Conti syndicate to monetize from failed encryption
attacks.
When Conti's ransomware payload is blocked and the attack does not enter the encryption
stage, the hackers release the already exfiltrated information as Karakurt for data extortion.
This was confirmed today in a report from cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf stating that,
during an investigation at a client that had previously paid Conti to unlock their data, found
that said client was later breached by Karakurt via a Cobalt Strike backdoor that Conti had
left behind.

The research from Arctic Wolf is a collaboration between its computer security service Tetra
Defense, cybersecurity company Northwave and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis and
it follows clues from more than a dozen Karakurt incidents and from cryptocurrency
transactions involving Conti and Karakurt operators.
Chainalysis' investigation revealed several Karakurt wallets that sent cryptocurrency to
wallets controlled by Conti. According to the researchers, payments from victims are
between $45,000 and $1 million.
The blockchain analyitics company also found Karakurt victim payment addresses hosted
by a Conti wallet, indicating that both gangs are managed by the same party.

Accessing Karakurt servers
While the Conti admin did not save the passwords in the FTP client, Infinitum IT
researchers say that they were able to obtain the SSH credentials for the Karakurt
command and control (C2) server by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in FileZilla.
The researchers also obtained this way an SSH private key that allowed connecting to the
Karakurt gang’s web server for their leak site, which is also served over the TOR network

According to Infinitum IT’s analysis, members of the Karakurt gang upload stolen data to a
“/work” folder and categorize it as public and non-public, their interest being mainly in
financial information.
As Infinitum IT completely compromised the Karakurt gang’s infrastructure, they were also
able to access the C2 server and the tools used in attacks.

Below is an enumeration of the utilities Karakurt uses in attacks and their description:
Ligolo-ng: tunneling and pivoting tool

Metasploit: used as a C2 server in the post-exploitation phase for obtaining reverse
shell and for brute-forcing SMB shares and RDP connections
Impacket: used for NTLM-relay attacks for lateral movement after getting initial access
Danted: auto-install and management script for Danted–Socks5 Proxy Server, for
reverse tunneling
Infinitum IT’s report is the first public evidence showing that Conti ransomware and the
Karakurt data extortion gang are part of the same financially-motivated group.
After Conti took over the infamous TrickBot botnet and shut it down to focus on the
development of BazarBackdoor and Anchor malware, researchers show that the
syndicate’s expansion is more aggressive.
Conti is now managing side businesses that either sustain its ransomware operations or
monetize the initial network access already available.
Update [March 15, 11:54 EST]: Article updated with information from cybersecurity
company Arctic Wolf confirming that Karakurt and Conti are part of the same operation.

Legal address of Inferno Solutions company: 22 Brоndеsbury Pаrk, Willesden,

The address range 209.222.98.19 - 209.222.98.255 belongs to the USA.
An interesting picture: these studies, unwittingly, prove that
- the Russian trace is fictitious, the dialogues of the hackers' correspondence are an
empty set of phrases and letters;
- Conti and Karakurt are controlled from the UK, based in the USA, transfer controlled
bitcoins to wallets that merge into one, which is also in ...
Or you need to believe that Russian hackers run the C2 and servers of these
countries as if they were their own, which is unlikely.
