Executive Summary
NullMixer is a dropper leading to an infection chain of a wide variety of malware families.
NullMixer spreads via malicious websites that can be found mainly via search engines.
These websites are often related to crack, keygen and activators for downloading software

1/27

illegally, and while they may pretend to be legitimate software, they actually contain a
malware dropper.
It looks like these websites are using SEO to stay at the top of search engine results, making
them easy to find when searching the internet for “cracks” and “keygens”. When users
attempt to download software from one of these sites, they are redirected multiple times, and
end up on a page containing the download instructions and archived password-protected
malware masquerading as the desired piece of software. When a user extracts and executes
NullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine. These malware
families may include backdoors, bankers, credential stealers and so on. For example, the
following families are among those dropped by NullMixer: SmokeLoader/Smoke,
LgoogLoader, Disbuk, RedLine, Fabookie, ColdStealer.

Technical Details
Initial infection
The infection vector of NullMixer is based on a ‘User Execution’ (MITRE Technique: T1204)
malicious link that requires the end user to click on and download a password-protected
ZIP/RAR archive with a malicious file that is extracted and executed manually.
The whole infection chain of NullMixer is as follows:

2/27

The user visits a website to download cracked software, keygens or activators. The
campaign appears to target anyone looking to download cracked software, and uses
SEO techniques to make these malicious sites more prominent at the top of search
engine results.

Top Google search engine results for “crack software” contain malicious
websites delivering NullMixer
The user clicks on the download link for the desired software.
The link redirects the user to another malicious website.
The malicious website redirects the user to a third-party IP address webpage.

3/27

The webpage instructs the user to download a password-protected ZIP file from a file
sharing website.

Malware execution instructions
The user extracts the archived file with the password.

4/27

The user runs the installer and executes the malware.

Example of NullMixer infection chain execution

NullMixer description
NullMixer is a dropper that includes more than just specific malware families; it drops a wide
variety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers,
downloaders, spyware and many others.

NullMixer execution chain
The real infection occurs when the user extracts the ‘win-setup-i864.exe’ file from the
downloaded password-protected archive and runs it. The ‘win-setup-i864.exe’ file is an NSIS
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) installation program, which is a very popular installation
instrument used by many software developers. In our case, it dropped and launched another
file, ‘setup_installer.exe’, that is in fact an SFX archive ‘7z Setup SFX’ wrapped into a
Windows executable. The ‘setup_installer.exe’ file dropped dozens of malicious files. But
instead of launching them, it launches a single executable – setup_install.exe – which is a
5/27

NullMixer starter component. NullMixer’s starter launches all the dropped executable files. To
do so, it contains a list of hardcoded file names, and launches them one by one using
‘cmd.exe’.

It also tries to change Windows Defender settings using the following command line.

"cmd.exe /c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive Command SetMpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend
-MAPSReporting Disable"

Immediately after all the dropped files have been launched, the NullMixer starter beacons to
the C&C about a successful installation. From this point, all the dropped and launched
malicious files are left to their own devices. With a little monitoring we can identify a wide
variety of malicious binaries that are spread by the NullMixer malware.

7/27

NullMixer and malware families it drops
Since the number of families turned out to be quite large, we decided to give only a brief
description of each in this report. A full technical description will be provided in subsequent
reports.

SmokeLoader

8/27

SmokeLoader (aka Smoke) is a modular malware that has been known since 2011,
distributed via phishing emails and drive-by downloads. It has evolved its capabilities with
additional modules over the years. For example, disabling of Windows Defender and antianalysis techniques have been added to the malware. However, most threat actors only use
the main functionality – payload downloading and executing.
In contrast to the simplest downloaders that download malicious files using hardcoded static
URLs, SmokeLoader communicates with the C&C in order to receive and perform download
tasks.

RedLine Stealer
RedLine Stealer has been known since early 2020 and developed through 2021. The
malware is known to be sold on online forums, and distributed via phishing emails.
A newer method of spreading RedLine Stealer is by luring Windows 10 users to get fake
Windows 11 upgrades. When the user downloads and executes the binary, they’re actually
running the malware.
RedLine’s main purpose is to steal credentials and information from browsers, in addition to
stealing credit card details and cryptocurrency wallets from the compromised machine.
Moreover, the malware also collects information about the system, such as: username,
hardware details and installed security applications.

PseudoManuscrypt
PseudoManuscrypt has been known since June 2021, and used as MaaS (Malware as a
Service). PseudoManuscrypt doesn’t target particular companies or industries, but it has
been observed that industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the
military-industrial complex and research laboratories, are the most significant victims.
The malware is known to be distributed via other botnets such as Glupteba. The main aim of
the PseudoManuscrypt threat actors is to spy on their victims by stealing cookies from
Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Yandex Browser, keylogging and
stealing cryptocurrency by utilizing the ClipBanker plugin. A distinctive feature of the malware
is the use of the KCP protocol to download additional plugins.

ColdStealer
ColdStealer is a relatively new malicious program that was discovered in 2022. Like many
other stealers its main purpose is to steal credentials and information from web browsers, in
addition to stealing cryptocurrency wallets, FTP credentials, various files and information

9/27

about the system such as OS version, system language, processor type and clipboard data.
The only known method of delivering stolen information to cybercriminals is by sending a ZIP
archive to an embedded control center.

ColdStealer Main() function

FormatLoader
FormatLoader is a downloader that got its name for using hardcoded URLs as format strings,
where it needs to fill a single digit to get a link to download an additional binary. The available
digit range is also hardcoded.

https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>
https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw3.exe

3

https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>
https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw4.exe

4

…
https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>
https://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw6.exe

10/27

FormatLoader’s main purpose is to infect the machine with an additional malicious file by
downloading the binary to the compromised machine. To do so, the malware adds digits from
the hardcoded range one by one to the hardcoded format strings, and accesses the
download links.
In addition, FormatLoader uses a third-party website service for tracking the compromised
machine. It sends a ‘GET’ request to a specific URL of an IP logger service, which collects
information such as IP address and IP-based geolocation.

CsdiMonetize
CsdiMonetize is known to be an advertising platform that used to install many different PUAs
(Potentially Unwanted Applications) on a Pay-Per-Install basis after infecting the user’s
machine. Later on, rather than just infecting their victim with PUAs, CsdiMoneitze began
infecting their victims with actual Trojans, like the Glupteba malware.
Nowadays, CsdiMonetize infects its victims with additional malware family types such as:
Fabookie, Disbuk, PseudoManuscrypt and more.

Csdi execution chain
The infection begins with NSIS installer ’61f665303c295_Sun1059d492746c.exe’, which
downloads the Csdi installer ‘MSEkni.exe‘. The Csdi installer requests the current
configuration from the C&C and a list of additional Csdi components to install. Configuration
is stored in several registry keys in encrypted and base64 encoded form. The next step is to
download additional components, the most notable being publisher and updater
components. The Csdi publisher component is responsible for showing advertisements by
launching the browser with URLs as command line parameters. The updater component is
responsible for a Pay-Per-Install service. It receives the list of URLs from the C&C and
instructions on how to drop and execute downloaded files.
11/27

Disbuk
Disbuk (aka Socelar) is known to disguise itself as a legitimate application, such as PDF
editor software.
This malware was found to mainly target Facebook Ads and evolved to steal Facebook
session cookies from Chrome and Firefox by accessing the browser’s SQLite database. After
retrieving this information, the malware attempts to extract additional information like access
tokens, account IDs, etc. After further evolution, Disbuk has also started retrieving Amazon
cookies.
Besides stealing data, Disbuk also installs a malicious browser extension that masquerades
as a Google Translate extension. To get more information about a user’s Facebook account,
Disbuk queries Facebook Graph API.

Fabookie
Fabookie is another stealer that targets Facebook Ads. Its functionality is similar to the
Disbuk malware, and includes stealing Facebook session cookies from browsers, using
Facebook Graph API Queries to receive additional information about a user’s account, linked
payment method, balance, friends, etc. Stolen credentials can later be used to run ads from
the compromised account.
Unlike Disbuk, this malware does not contain built-in malicious browser extensions, but
contains two embedded NirSoft utilities – ‘Chrome Cookies View’ and ‘Web Browser
Password Viewer’ – that are used to extract data from browsers.

DanaBot
DanaBot is a Trojan-Banker written in Delphi that spreads via email phishing, and is known
to have evolved since it was discovered in 2018.
DanaBot is a modular malware that includes various additional modules; the most popular
functionalities of these modules are stealing information from compromised machines and
injecting fake forms into popular ecommerce and social media sites to collect payment data.
It can also provide full access to infected systems with remote desktop, or mouse and
keyboard access by utilizing a VNC plugin.

Racealer
Racealer (aka RaccoonStealer) is known to be a stealer-type malware that mostly extracts
user credentials and exfiltrates data from compromised machines.

12/27

Racoon is also known to have evolved over the years since it was discovered in 2019. For
example, it now uses Telegram to retrieve C&C IP addresses and malware configurations.
Moreover, additional modules are now being downloaded from the malware’s C&Cs that are
also used to extract credentials.

Generic.ClipBanker
Generic.ClipBanker is a clipboard hijacker malware that monitors the clipboard of the
compromised machine, and specifically searches for cryptocurrency addresses in order to
replace them. When a user copies an address of a cryptocurrency wallet the malware
replaces the address of the wallet with their own cryptocurrency wallet address, so the end
user sends cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) to them rather than to the intended wallet
address.

SgnitLoader
The SgnitLoader is a small Trojan-Downloader written in C#. The downloader binary size is
about 15 Kbytes. However, the original file is packed with Obsidium, which makes the binary
size grow to more than 400 Kbytes.
The SgnitLoader contains a few hardcoded domains in its binary, to which it appends the
path and adds a number from 1 to 7. Unlike the FormatLoader malware, it doesn’t use a
format string, but simply adds a number to the end of the string in order to get the full URL.
1
2

"https://presstheme[.]me/" + "?user=" + "l10_" + "1" => "https://presstheme.me/?
user=l10_1"

3

"https://presstheme[.]me/" + "?user=" + "l10_" + "2" => "https://presstheme.me/?
user=l10_2"

4

…
"https://presstheme[.]me/" + "?user=" + "l10_" + "7" => "https://presstheme.me/?
user=l10_7"

After the download and execute procedures are completed, SgnitLoader pings back to the
C&C with a ‘GET’ request. The original pingback URL is hidden with the ‘iplogger.org’ URL
shortener service.

ShortLoader
Another small Trojan-Downloader written in C#. Its binary is half the size of SgnitLoader. Its
main function code is fairly short and it uses the ‘IP Logger‘ URL shortener service to hide
the original URL that it downloads the payload from. That’s why it’s called ShortLoader.

14/27

Downloader.INNO
The original file is an ‘Inno Setup’ installer that utilizes ‘Inno Download Plugin’ download
functionality.
The setup script is programmed to download a file from the URL
‘http://onlinehueplet[.]com/77_1.exe‘ placing it into the ‘%TEMP%‘ directory as
‘dllhostwin.exe‘ and executing it with the string ’77’ as an argument.

15/27

Part of Inno Setup installation script
The downloaded file belongs to the Satacom Trojan-Downloader family. However, in the
course of our research we discovered that this file was replaced on the server with legitimate
PuTTY software, a popular SSH client.

LgoogLoader
This file is another software installer that uses the Microsoft Cabinet archive-file format. After
execution, it drops three files: a batch file, an AutoIt interpreter with a stripped executable
header and an AutoIt script. Then it executes the batch file with ‘cmd.exe’. The task of the
batch file is to restore the AutoIt interpreter executable, and launch it with a path to the AutoIt
script as a command line argument.
AutoIt script performs a few AntiVM and AntiDebug checks. If all the checks are successful,
then it starts AutoIt interpreter once again, decrypts and decompresses the embedded
executable and injects it into the newly created process. The injected executable is
LgoogLoader.
LgoogLoader is a Trojan-Downloader that downloads an encrypted configuration file from a
hardcoded static URL. It then decrypts the configuration, extracts additional URLs from it and
downloads and executes the final payloads. It was called LgoogLoader due to its use of
strings from ‘Google Privacy Policy’.

Downloader.Bitser
The original file is an NSIS installer that tries to install PUA: Lightening Media Player. The file
is downloaded by CsdiMonetize’s updater component (MD5:
98f0556a846f223352da516af66fa1a0). However, the installation script is configured not only
to set up Lightening Media Player, but also to run the built-in Windows utility ‘bitsadmin’ to
download additional files, which is why we call it Bitser. In our case, the utility was used
inside the installation script of the NSIS installer, and used to download a 7z passwordprotected archive. The password for the 7z archive and instructions for unpacking and
execution are also hardcoded into the installation script.

17/27

Downloader.Bitser’s infection chain
A legitimate 7-Zip Standalone Console application is dropped by the installer under the name
‘data_load.exe‘ and launched with arguments to unpack files from the downloaded archive.

C-Joker
C-Joker is an incredibly simple Exodus wallet stealer. It uses the Telegram API to send
notifications about successful or failed installations. In order to steal credentials, it downloads
a backdoored version of the ‘app.asar’ file and replaces the original file from the Exodus
wallet.

18/27

PrivateLoader
PrivateLoader is yet another example of a Pay-Per-Install malicious loader like LgoogLoader
and SmokeLoader. It uses a single-byte XOR encryption key to receive URLs from the
control center.

Satacom
Satacom is also known as LegionLoader. Discovered in 2019, Satacom uses different antianalysis tricks that were probably borrowed from the al-khazer stress tool. The embedded
user agent varies from sample to sample, but in our case the user agent is “deus vult”.

19/27

Strings in Satacom binary
The latest version receives the main control center address from TXT-record. Satacom
sends a DNS TXT-query to ‘reosio.com‘ and receives a response with a base64 encoded
string.

20/27

Satacom DNS request and response
After decoding and decrypting with the XOR key “DARKMATTER” it gets the real C&C URL
‘banhamm.com‘.

GCleaner
GCleaner is another Pay-Per-Install malicious loader. It was discovered at the beginning of
2019. Initially it was distributed as a cleaning tool called Garbage Cleaner or G-Cleaner
through a fake website mimicking popular cleaning tools like CCleaner. The main loader was
used to download potentially unwanted applications together with malware such as Azorult,
Vidar, PredatorTheThief, miners and so on. GCleaner is now distributed by various crack
websites along with other malware. This PPI platform uses C&C-based geolocation
targeting, meaning it can push different malware depending on the victim’s IP address.
Although the GCleaner loader is no longer mimicking cleaning tools, there are some still

21/27

remnants of this in its binary code such as encrypted strings like
“Software\GCleaner\Started” or “\Garbage.Cleaner”. The sample of GCleaner that we
detected when analyzing this campaign was trying to download the Vidar password stealer.

Vidar
Vidar is an info-stealer. It downloads DLL files freebl3.dll, mozglue.dll, msvcp140.dll, nss3.dll,
softokn3.dll and vcruntime140.dll from its C&C for use in password-grabbing routines. Vidar
can also receive settings from the C&C that tells it exactly what to do. It is able to steal
autofill information from web browsers, cookies, saved credit cards, browser history, coin
wallets and Telegram databases. It also can make and send screenshots to the C&C, as well
as any file that matches a specified mask.

Vidar downloads DLL files and uploads collected data

Victims
Since the beginning of the year we’ve blocked attempts to infect more than 47,778 victims
worldwide. Some of the most targeted countries are Brazil, India, Russia, Italy, Germany,
France, Egypt, Turkey and the United States.

Attribution
We are currently unable to directly attribute NullMixer to any group.

Conclusions

22/27

Trying to save money by using unlicensed software can be costly. A single file downloaded
from an unreliable source can lead to a large-scale infection of a computer system. As we
can see, a large proportion of the malware families dropped by NullMixer are classified as
Trojan-Downloaders, which suggests infections will not be limited to the malware families
described in this report. Many of the other malware families mentioned here are stealers, and
compromised credentials can be used for further attacks inside a local network.
