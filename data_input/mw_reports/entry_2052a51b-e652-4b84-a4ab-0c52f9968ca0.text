NFT Lure Used to Distribute BitRAT

February 14, 2022

Despite being around for many years, blockchain captured the zeitgeist of the digital movement with the
advent of Bitcoin. Digital currencies, however, are not the only application of this technology. Non-fungible
tokens (NFT) entered the popular lexicon in 2021. An NFT is a digital token that uses blockchain to verify
the authenticity of digital content and ownership, such as art, music, collectibles, and in-video-game items.
The first major NFT splash came in March 2021, when the digital work of art “Everydays – The First 5000
Days” created by the digital artist “Beeple” was auctioned and sold for a record-breaking $69 million. Later
that month, the NFT of the very first tweet posted by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was sold for $2.9
million. NFTs even gave new life to a popular 10-year-old internet meme, “Nyan Cat.” The original creator
remastered the GIF and sold it as an NFT for 10 Ethereum ($590,000).
Exclusive possession of unique assets tends to drive the desire for ownership—and the price—sky-high.
And predictably, online criminals are there trying to exploit this activity.
FortiGuard Labs recently came across a peculiar-looking Excel spreadsheet that seemingly included NFTrelated information. But instead, it downloads and installs the BitRAT malware in the background. This blog
describes how this attack works.

Affected Platforms: Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users
Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor
Severity Level: Medium

Strange looking Excel macro file (XLSM) and target
The original source of the malicious Excel file has not been identified. However, the file provides some
clues as to its origin and target. First, the XLSM is named “NFT_Items.xlsm”. Second, the file has two
workbooks, one of which is in Hebrew. That workbook contains what appears to be legitimate Discord
rooms that deal with NFTs. It also includes the names of NFTs, forecasts for potential investment returns
(hyped, solid, and 50/50), and selling quantities. Finally, like many similar recent attacks, this attack abuses
Discord by using it to host malicious files. These points provide enough evidence to conclude that the
attacker likely sent a message to NFT enthusiasts in Israel to entice them to download and open the
malicious XLSM.
Figure 1. Malicious XLSM file, “NFT_Item.xlsm”
The XLSM contains a malicious macro, which the user is asked to enable upon opening the file. Once the
XLSM file is opened, and the macro is enabled, the XLSM drops a batch file. It then uses a PowerShell
script to download another file from Discord, NFTEXE.exe.

Figure 3. Windows batch file dropped by the malicious macro in NFT_Item.xlsx
Figure 4. Decoded PowerShell script delivered by the batch file in Figure 3
The downloaded NFTEXE.exe is a .NET executable file that attempts to run "ipconfig /renew" and then pull
down yet another file, NFTEXE.png, from Discord. Disguised as an image file, NFTEXE.png is pure data
with all its strings flipped (see Figure 5.).
Figure 5. Reversed strings in NFTEXE.png
Running "ipconfig/renew" is an attempt to disrupt analysis of the malware should it find itself running in a
cloud environment by dropping the connection to the analyst so that the NFTEXE.png will not be
downloaded.
NFTEXE.exe then reverses these strings into the next stage file, “Nnkngxzwxiuztittiqgz.dll”. A .NET DLL
appears to have been compiled on January 2nd, 2022. Since the malicious XLSM was made available on a
public online scan service on January 3rd, the XLSM file was distributed soon after compilation.
NFTEXE.exe copies itself as C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Adobe\Cloud.exe, which runs at every startup to maintain persistence. NFTEXE.exe also
makes a copy of MSBuild.exe, a legitimate Windows file, to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local and runs
it. NFTEXE.exe then injects a malicious payload into the running MSBuild.exe using
Nnkngxzwxiuztittiqgz.dll.

BitRAT

2/4

Our analysis determined that the payload is BitRAT, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that was first sold in a
hacking forum in August 2020.
One trait of the BitRAT sample that FortiGuard Labs analyzed is its usage of Hidden VNC (HVNC). HVNC
provides an attacker with remote access to the compromised machine. BitRAT is known to have borrowed
the HVNC code from another malware, TinyNuke, the source code of which was leaked in 2017. Another
notable thing included in the BitRAT sample is a string, “AVE_MARIA”, used as a traffic header value when
an HVNC client communicates to its C2 server for verification. The HVNC communication is designed to
fail if the traffic header value is not “AVE_MARIA”.
More BitRAT functionality was revealed during our analysis once additional strings were decrypted. For
example, we were able to see that BitRAT can bypass User Account Control (UAC)—a Windows security
feature first introduced in Windows Vista that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system
—and Windows Defender— an anti-malware component of Microsoft Windows first released with Windows
XP. We also found that this variant can also monitor the screen and, if present, utilize the webcam.
Figure 6. More BitRAT capabilities
After the strings were decrypted, it also became apparent that BitRAT uses Slowloris for its DDoS
capabilities.
Figure 7. Slowloris DDOS
Other BitRAT functionality includes:
Stealing credentials from browsers and applications installed on the compromised machine
Mining Monero cryptocurrency
Logging keystrokes
Uploading and downloading additional files to the compromised machine
Listening live through a microphone
In an attempt to hide stolen information, this variant of BitRAT stores collected data (keystrokes, clipboard
data, etc.) in an alternate data stream (ADS) file that is majority encoded in Base64.
Figure 8. BitRAT writing to ADS file C:\Users\REM\AppData\Local:11-01-22
As can be inferred by the file name above, a new file will be created each day and given the name of the
current date.

The C2 server (205[.]185[.]118[.]52) this particular BitRAT variant connects to belongs to FranTech
Solutions, a hosting provider that is known as a bulletproof hosting service provider. A bulletproof hosting
service is just like a regular web hosting service in that they are used to store content. The difference is
that a bulletproof hosting service also hosts illegal content, such as malware, C2, exploit kits, and fake
shopping sites. They also tend to be more resistant to complaints and takedown requests.

Conclusion
In this attack, NFT was used to lure a victim into opening a malicious XLSM file to deliver BitRAT, which put
the victim’s data and machine at risk.

3/4

NFT is a new internet phenomenon that some view as a legitimate investment and money-making
opportunity. Any investment comes with risk, but certain risks taken before money changes hands are
avoidable. Be mindful that attackers often use attractive and trendy subjects as lures. As NFTs become
increasingly popular, they will be used to entice victims into opening malicious files or clicking on malicious
links. Standard security practices such as not opening files downloaded from untrusted or suspicious
sources can prevent threat actors from gaining access to users’ money and valuable data.
