TA410: The Group Behind LookBack Attacks Against U.S. Utilities Sector Returns with New Malware

2/18

June 08, 2020 Michael Raggi, Dennis Schwarz, and Georgi Mladenov with the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
In August 2019, Proofpoint researchers reported that LookBack malware was targeting the United States (U.S.)
utilities sector between July and August 2019. We then continued our analysis into additional LookBack campaigns
that unfolded between August 21-29, 2019. These campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents in order to
deliver modular malware to targeted utility providers across the U.S. At the same time as the LookBack campaigns,
Proofpoint researchers identified a new, additional malware family named FlowCloud that was also being delivered
to U.S. utilities providers.
FlowCloud malware, like LookBack, gives attackers complete control over a compromised system. Its remote access
trojan (RAT) functionality includes the ability to access installed applications, the keyboard, mouse, screen, files,
services, and processes with the ability to exfiltrate information via command and control.
We analyzed phishing campaigns between July-November 2019 and have determined that both LookBack and
FlowCloud malware can be attributed to a single threat actor we are calling TA410. This conclusion is based on the
threat actor’s use of shared attachment macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery
infrastructure.
In addition, our analysis found similarities between TA410 and TA429 (APT10) delivery tactics. Specifically, we have
seen attachment macros that are common to both actors. TA410 campaigns detected in November 2019 included
TA429 (APT10)-related infrastructure used in phishing attachment delivery macros. However, Proofpoint analysts
believe that intentional reuse of well-publicized TA429 (APT10) techniques and infrastructure may be an attempt by
threat actors to create a false flag. For this reason, while research is ongoing, we do not attribute LookBack and
FlowCloud campaigns to TA429 (APT10). Proofpoint currently tracks TA429 (APT10) independently of TA410
campaigns.
Figure 1 below shows a timeline of the identified LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns.

Figure 1 LookBack and FlowCloud Campaign Timeline
Delivery
Proofpoint researchers observed phishing campaigns beginning on July 10, 2019 that targeted utility providers
across the United States with portable executable (PE) attachments and used subject lines such as “PowerSafe
energy educational courses (30-days trial)”. These campaigns continued through September 2019.
Our analysis of these phishing campaigns determined that the PE attachments delivered a modular malware which
the developers referred to in program data base (“PDB”) paths as “FlowCloud”. We therefore refer to these
campaigns as “FlowCloud” based on the malware family they delivered. It’s notable that these FlowCloud campaigns
were occurring at the same time as the LookBack campaigns that Proofpoint has previously documented. Both the
FlowCloud and LookBack campaigns targeted utility providers in the United States. Both used training and
certification-themed lures. And both used threat actor-controlled domains for delivery. In some cases, both
FlowCloud and LookBack campaigns targeted not only the same companies but also the same recipients.
The senders of the emails that delivered FlowCloud malware utilized threat actor-controlled domains for delivery
which impersonated energy sector training services, as well as utilized subdomains which contained the word
“engineer”.
We observed a distinct change in FlowCloud delivery tactics beginning with attacks carried out in November 2019.
The targeting of US utilities companies remained constant, but the threat actors shifted from PE attachments to
malicious macro laden Microsoft Word documents that closely resembled the same delivery and installation macros
used in LookBack malware campaigns.
Additionally, in November threat actors began to utilize the sender domain asce[.]email to deliver these attachments.
This domain was first observed in June 2019 registered to the IP 103.253.41[.]75 which was used as a staging and
reconnaissance IP in previous LookBack campaigns. On October 29, 2019, the domain resolved to the IP
134.209.99[.]169 which also hosted several energy certification and education themed domains. A number of these
domains also shared an SSL certificate with delivery domains previously observed in the July and August 2019
FlowCloud phishing campaigns. The data from this SSL Certificate has been displayed in Figure 2. This figure
demonstrates the actor’s use of a single SSL certificate for multiple energy and training themed domains. The actor
listed the domains that were signed by the certificate in the Alternative Names field allowing for the identification of
additional related infrastructure. A number of these domains were used in FlowCloud campaigns.

The content of the emails in the November 2019 campaigns impersonated the American Society of Civil Engineers
and masqueraded as the legitimate domain asce[.]org. The structure of this email is very similar to the LookBack
delivery emails constructed to impersonate the NCEES and Global Energy Certification in July 2019. Examples of
the emails are included in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

Exploitation - Installation Macros
As noted above, after an extended period of using PE attachments to deliver FlowCloud in campaigns, the threat
actors behind FlowCloud switched to using Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros at the beginning of
November 2019. The Word document attachments and macros delivering FlowCloud had key similarities with the
Word document attachments and macros we identified that delivered LookBack in July and August 2019.
Identical to the methodology used with LookBack, the FlowCloud macro used privacy enhanced mail (“.pem”) files
which were subsequently renamed to the text file “pense1.txt”. This file is next saved as a portable executable file
named “gup.exe” and executed using a version of the certutil.exe tool named “Temptcm.tmp”.

For comparison, Figure 5 November 2019 macro used to install FlowCloud malware shows the macro used to install
FlowCloud while Figure 6 August 2019 macro used to install LookBack malware shows the macro used to install
LookBack.

Figure 5 November 2019 macro used to install FlowCloud malware

Figure 6 August 2019 macro used to install LookBack malware
The “Exploitation” section in our blog LookBack Malware Targets the United States Utilities Sector with Phishing
Attacks Impersonating Engineering Licensing Boards has a more in-depth explanation of this method used by
LookBack. FlowCloud uses this same method exactly including identical macro concatenation code.
While we found the ultimate execution method for both the LookBack Gup proxy tool and FlowCloud malware were
the same across both macro versions, we found that the FlowCloud macro introduced a new method for the delivery
of the malware.
The earlier LookBack versions of the macro included the payload in numerous privacy enhanced email (“.pem”) files
that were dropped when the attachment file is executed by the user. The FlowCloud version of the macro utilized a
previously unobserved macro section to download the payload from a DropBox URL. Once the payload was
downloaded, a FlowCloud malware PE in the form of a .pem file was saved as the variable “Pense1.txt”. Figure 7
FlowCloud Malware Macro delivery code shows the FlowCloud macro with the delivery section in question called
out.

8/18

Figure 7 FlowCloud Malware Macro delivery code
The FlowCloud macro also contained a strange try… catch statement which initially attempts to download the
FlowCloud payload from the DropBox URL as part of the try statement. However, if it was unable to retrieve the
payload from that resource, a catch statement which was nearly identical to the try statement attempted to retrieve a
malware resource from the URL http://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt”.”. Figure 8 FlowCloud Malware Catch
statement macro code shows the catch statement in question.

Figure 8 FlowCloud Malware Catch statement macro code
This try…catch sequence is significant because the URL in the catch statement and malware resource was
previously mentioned in a May 2019 blog by enSilo entitled “Uncovering New Activity by APT10”. The blog claims
that this URL delivered a modified Quasar RAT payload which included the addition of SharpSploit, an opensource
post-exploitation tool. When analyzed on the same date of FlowCloud campaign delivery this URL and resource was
unavailable, while the DropBox URL successfully delivered the FlowCloud .pem file. While Proofpoint has not
independently verified these attribution claims made by other researchers regarding the referenced Quasar RAT
sample, the use of this URL represents a previously undisclosed overlap with publicly reported indicators of
compromise attributed to TA429 (APT10). While on the surface this domain may imply links to TA429 (APT10), we
have identified several aberrations regarding the domain registration information and inactive nature of the URL and
will discuss them at length at length later in this blog.
FlowCloud Malware
Our analysis of the FlowCloud malware determined that it is a multi-stage payload comprised of a large code base
written in C++. The code demonstrates a level of complexity including numerous components, extensive objectoriented programming, and use of legitimate and imitation QQ files for initial and later stage execution. We found
further imitation of QQ components in several modules used throughout FlowCloud execution. The malware name
“FlowCloud” was taken from distinctive PDB paths observed in numerous malware components. These values have
been included in the IOCs section at the end of this blog.

9/18

FlowCloud malware is capable of RAT functionalities based on its available commands including accessing the
clipboard, installed applications, keyboard, mouse, screen, files, services, and processes with the ability to exfiltrate
information via command and control. Additionally, the malware variants analyzed have several distinct
characteristics that indicate the malware may have been active in the threat landscape since at least July 2016.
In addition to components built to target updated Windows versions, FlowCloud samples have dropped a 32-bit
module that was only compatible with Windows versions 6 (Windows Vista) and below. The dated nature of this
binary coupled with the extensible nature of the malware code suggests that the FlowCloud code base has been
under development for numerous years. Public reports around FlowCloud malware components and related
installation directory paths suggest that versions of this malware may have been observed in the wild as early as
July 2016. Additionally, development of this malware around legitimate QQ files and the identification of malware
samples uploaded to VirusTotal from Japan in December 2018 and earlier this year from Taiwan indicate that the
malware may have been active for some time in Asia prior to its appearance targeting the US utilities sector.
Figure 9 Flowchart of FlowCloud Loader Functionality below outlines FlowCloud’s loader functionality.

10/18

Figure 9 Flowchart of FlowCloud Loader Functionality
The malware begins with the execution of Gup.exe by the malicious macro which in turn executes the file
EhStorAuthn.exe.
EhStorAuthn.exe extracts the subsequent payload file components and installs them to the directory
C:\Windows\Media\SystemPCAXD\ado\fc. This file also sets registry key values that store the keylogger
drivers and the malware configuration as the value “KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\PrintResponsor\
<2-4>”.

11/18

EhStorAuthn.exe is a legitimate portable executable file used by QQ with the initial name QQSetupEx.exe. This
file is used to load the file dlcore.dll as part of its natural downloader routine.
Dlcore.dll is a DLL crafted by the threat actors that functions as a shellcode injector pulling the shellcode from a
file named rebare.dat. This file imitates a legitimate QQ component.
When the shellcode within rebare.dat is executed it in turn executes a RAT installer file named rescure.dat.
Rescure.dat is an XOR encrypted DLL file that installs the RAT based application responsor.dat which installs
the keylogger driver and manages the RAT functionality.
Responsor.dat unpacks several modules (rescure86.dat or rescure64.dat) to the registry %TEMP%\{0d47c9bc7b04-4d81-9ad8-b2e00681de8e}" and installs the unpacked file as a service named “FSFilter Activity Monitor”
or “FltMgr”.
Finally, Responsor.dat starts the RAT when the rescure.dat function “startModule” is called.
Several legitimate Microsoft Windows files were also used by the malware for thread injection.
EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe (hhw.exe) a Microsoft HTML Help Workshop file was used as a placeholder for
thread injection.
Hha.dll is a component of Microsoft HTML Help Workshop and is required to run EhStorAuthn_shadow.exe.
The malware stores its configuration in the registry alongside drivers utilized by the malware’s keylogger
components. Several additional distinct registry keys are generated which indicate the malware’s current execution
stage on the host. Some of these keys are included in the table below.

FlowCloud Configuration
The FlowCloud loader component EhStorAuthn.exe stores the malware configuration in the registry early in the
installation chain and is represented in the table above. The Registry data is composed of multiple encrypted
headers (using XORs and RORs) and data is encrypted using a modified (or broken) AES algorithm. The plaintext
data is compressed with ZLIB and serialized using Google’s Protocol Buffers. Figure 10 shows an example of a
configuration as displayed by FlowCloud’s debug logging:

12/18

Figure 10 Example of a configuration as displayed by debug logging
Command and Control
FlowCloud malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands as independent threads utilizing a
custom binary C2 protocol. We identified these independent threads as part of an extensive command handling
functionality with distinct command managers existing for each command. The sample we analyzed utilized port
55555 for file exfiltration and port 55556 for all other data. We identified FlowCloud communication with the IP
188.131.233[.]27. The requests and responses are composed of multiple encrypted headers (using XORs and
RORs) and TEA encrypted data using a key generation scheme involving a hardcoded string of random characters
and MD5 hashing. The plaintext data is compressed using ZLIB and serialized using Google’s Protocol Buffers. An
example parsing of an initial beacon is demonstrated in Figure 11 Example of FlowCloud parsing an initial C2
beacon:

Comparing Public TA429 (APT10) Indicators with TA410 Campaigns
Publications by FireEye and EnSilo regarding TA429 (APT10) campaigns contain indicators that later appeared in
TA410 campaigns. In our retrospective analysis of that research, we determined that TA429 (APT10) used phishing
macros that were later seen being used by LookBack and FlowCloud malware. Additionally, we identified the Quasar
RAT delivery URL hxxp://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt used by FlowCloud macros in November, which was
published in the enSilo report prior to observable weaponization for TA410 campaigns.
Interestingly, the compilation date of several LookBack malware modules used in July 2019 were September 14,
2018. This includes the SodomMain and SodomNormal modules covered in previous Proofpoint blogs on LookBack
malware. That date is just one day after FireEye released their initial analysis of similar TA429 (APT10) macros
14/18

utilized in Japan on September 13, 2018.
While LookBack malware samples were not observed in the wild until June 2019, this September 2018 compilation
date demonstrates a large lag time between compilation and delivery. This possibly suggests manipulation of
compilation times by threat actors but has not been conclusively determined.
The first identified server installation by TA410 on actor-controlled infrastructure occurred in December 2018. Most of
the domain registration (weaponization) for LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns began in May and June 2019
respectively. These events were after FireEye’s initial publication in September 2018.
Additionally, enSilo’s publication on potentially TA429 (APT10) related Quasar RAT samples was published on May
24, 2019. It was not until the second week of November 2019 when the inactive URL was incorporated into a
phishing macro as part of a FlowCloud campaign targeting US utilities. WHOIS records and passive DNS information
for ffca.caibi379[.]com indicate that the registrant email and address fields for the domain were updated on June 7,
2019. The A record for the domain was updated on September 9, 2019 at which time it resolved to the IP
34.80.27[.]200 contained within an ASN owned by Google. For the prior eight months beginning on January 2, 2019
and encompassing the period of activity discussed by enSilo, the domain was hosted on several IP’s in an ASN
owned by APNIC Hostmaster. The shift away from IP infrastructure owned by APNIC represents a departure in
threat actor infrastructure hosting tactics well after the publication by enSilo and within the weaponization period for
TA410’s campaign targeting US utilities. While this research is not conclusive, it demonstrates that all observed
TA429 (APT10) similarities and indicators of compromise were available publicly prior to the start of TA410
campaigns. Therefore, while not conclusive from current analysis, the possibility remains that these overlaps
represent false flag activity by the TA410 threat actor. Based on this analysis Proofpoint analysts track TA410 as a
distinct threat actor from TA429 (APT10) at this time.
Conclusion
The convergence of LookBack and FlowCloud malware campaigns in November 2019 demonstrates the capabilities
of TA410 actors to distinctly utilize multiple tools as part of a single ongoing campaign against US utilities providers.
Both malware families demonstrate a level of sophistication in their conception and development while the extensible
code base of FlowCloud malware suggests that this group may have been operating as early as 2016. TA410
operators demonstrate a willingness to dynamically evolve phishing tactics to increase the effectiveness of their
campaigns and a keen eye towards plausible social engineering within a very select targeted sector. It remains
unclear if the nature of the tactics and indicators that are shared with TA429 (APT10) were developed by this group
or culled from readily available technical reporting that pre-dated these campaigns. The possibility remains that
these overlaps represent intentional false flag efforts to cloak the identity of these perpetrators while they targeted a
critical and geo-politically sensitive sector of energy providers in the US. Regardless of the actor’s intention, TA410
has established itself as a motivated actor with mature toolsets carrying out long term campaigns against highly
important and geographically concentrated target sets.
