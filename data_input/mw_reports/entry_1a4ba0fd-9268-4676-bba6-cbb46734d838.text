Zeoticus 2.0 | Ransomware With No C2 Required

Overview
Zeoticus ransomware first appeared for sale in various underground forums and markets in
early 2020. Initially, the ransomware was offered as a complete custom build for an
undisclosed fee. The ransomware is currently Windows-specific and, according to the
developers, functions on all “supported versions of Windows”.
Unusually, there are no connectivity requirements for the payloads to execute. Zeoticus
ransomware will execute fully offline, with no dependence on a C2 (Command & Control). It
is also worth noting that the malware is designed not to function in some regions, specifically
Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan. Like many other families, use within the CIS is discouraged
in order to avoid any backlash from regional government and law enforcement agencies.

Zeoticus Development
Since late 2020 and moving into early 2021, the vendor has continued to maintain and offer
updates on the Zeoticus service.
In December 2020, samples of Zeoticus 2.0 were observed and reported in the wild. Multiple
researchers and security vendors began to take notice and analyze these updated samples (
e.g., tweet from @demonslay335)

A recent public announcement includes updates on file extension-based identification and
performance around the prioritization and encryption of extremely large files.

2/10

Most of the updates in Zeoticus 2.0 are focused on speed and efficiency. Specific encryption
algorithms (both symmetric and asymmetric) have been employed based on their speed
(e.g., Poly1305 is used for signing the primary encryption key rather than something like
SHA1).
Other notable features include compatibility with “all lines of Windows OSs”, with some
indications that the ransomware will even run on Windows XP and earlier.
The ransomware also has the ability to discover and infect remote drives and to discover and
terminate processes that could interfere with the encryption process.

Execution and Persistence
Upon execution, pertinent files are identified based on extension. The encryptable-extension
list is fully customizable and in the control of the attacker.
When launched, the malware makes a few copies of itself in the following locations:
C:Windows
%AppData%

Following this, Zeoticus proceeds to kill off a number of running processes (via
taskkill.exe ) as follows:

sqlagent.exe
sqlbrowser.exe

sqlwriter.exe
oracle.exe
ocssd.exe
dbsnmp.exe

msaccess.exe
mspub.exe
onenote.exe
outlook.exe
powerpnt.exe
sqlservr.exe
thebat64.exe
thunderbird.exe
winword.exe
Wordpad.exe

Zeoticus utilizes the ping command to facilitate the deletion of its own binaries, redirecting
the output of the command to >nul & del to achieve this.
/c ping localhost -n 3 > nul & del %s

The following WMI query is then issued to gather additional information about the local
environment:
start iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,
caption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,
parentprocessid from win32_process where ( caption = "msftesql.exe" or caption =
"sqlagent.exe" or caption = "sqlbrowser.exe" or caption = "sqlservr.exe" or caption =
"sqlwriter.exe" or caption = "oracle.exe" or caption = "ocssd.exe" or caption =

All samples analyzed across Zeoticus 1.0 and 2.0 create the Registry Run key to achieve
persistence:
REGISTRYUSER----SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun

The registry entry (Run) is set to launch an instance of the Zeoticus payload from
C:Windows :

Encryption and Ransom Note
The ransomware uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption. XChaCha20
is utilized on the symmetric side, while the combination of Poly1305, XSalsa20 and
Curve25519 is used for the asymmetric side.
Encrypted files are modified with extensions that include the contact email address of the
attacker(s) along with the string “2020END”, which is no doubt a reference to the new year.

In parallel with the encryption of the host’s data, Zeoticus mounts a new volume which
contains the ransom note. Victims are instructed to contact the attacker via email as opposed
to using an onion-based payment portal or similar. Additionally, the ransomware will drop a
copy of the ransom note to the root of the system drive ( e.g., C:WINDOWSREADME.html ).

This is one of the more noticeable differences between Zeoticus 2.0 and 1.0. That is, in
v1.0, the desktop wallpaper was actually altered with the victim instructions as opposed to
mounting the new volume.

Conclusion
Attackers are continuing to improve upon their techniques and tactics. Active ransomware
infections are getting increasingly difficult to control, contain, and mitigate. Prevention of
these attacks is more important than ever given the difficulty of recovering from a
catastrophic ransomware attack. We encourage all to review their security posture and take
any necessary steps to improve their protections and reduce their overall exposure. Visibility
and education go a long way here. A thorough and accurate understanding of the
environment is key in prioritizing controls and reducing risk. It is also important to educate
end users on the methods used by these attackers, and encourage them to report any
suspicious activity they observe. Finally, ensure that all technological controls are installed
and implemented properly, and are up to date with the latest patches.
