For a few months Cluster25 collected and analyzed several malicious activities which then were
internally linked with the threat actor known as UNC1151 (aka GhostWriter), an adversary believed to
be linked to the Belarusian government. In July 2020 Mandiant Threat Intelligence released a

1/8

public report about an ongoing influence campaign named “GhostWriter“. The campaign was
addressed to audiences in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland making use of critical messages against the
NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
In addition to this type of operations, UNC1151 seems to be further active also in the compromise of
objectives of strategic importance. On March 4, 2022, Cluster25 collected a malicious document
designed to spread malware for espionage purposes against targets located in Ukraine that displays
the logos of the Ukrainian President’s office and secret services with content relating to advice on
dealing with the bombing.

INSIGHTS
The document is a Microsoft Compressed HTML Help (CHM) file named dovidka.chm. After
extracting the file, it shows the following structure:

2/8

dividka.chm contains a file named file.htm that in its turn contains obfuscated vbscript (VBS) code
as reported following:

The script checks for the presence of the file
C:\Users\Public\Favorites\desktop.ini
then it writes a second VBS script under the path
C:\Users\Public\ignit.vbs
After that, it runs the latter script, deletes it and finally runs the command

3/8

wscript.exe //B //E:vbs C:UsersPublicFavoritesdesktop.ini
The script ignit.vbs decodes and writes the following files:
C:\Users\Public\Libraries\core.dll
C:\Users\Public\Favorites\desktop.ini
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Windows Prefetch.lnk
The desktop.ini file runs the following command, which executes the file core.dll with the Microsoft
Assembly Registration Tool (Regasm.exe):
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\regasm.exe /U
“C:Users\Public\Libraries\core.dll”
MICROLOADER

The file core.dll is a DLL file in .NET code compiled on Monday January 31st 2022 at 15:00:46 UTC.
Code obfuscation and anti-tampering techniques have been used to hinder the analysis. The kind of
anti-tampering techniques used shows similarities with the use of the open-source code-protector tool
for .NET named ConfuserEx. This is because several methods appear as empty and decompilation
exceptions are present when the file is open in tools such as dnSpy, as reported in the image below:

We thought to make the code a little more readable by setting a breakpoint after the anti-tamper
method (first method in the constructor) and by replacing the method with NOPs to finally save and
reopen the module in dnSpy. This is necessary since the method is responsible for changing the RVA
values of the methods. After this is executed, the values are correct, so it is possible to dump the new
version of the DLL, but it is also necessary to avoid the anti-tamper method to be called in the next
execution, otherwise it would change the values again.

4/8

This code is basically a payload aimed at unpacking and executing a payload

MICROBACKDOOR

The piece of code in the new thread it’s basically meant to perform a connection to the domain
xbeta[.]online attested on IP address 185.175.158[.]27.

5/8

If the connection is successful it receives and decrypts commands and performs the appropriate
actions. The identified commands that can be executed are
id
info
ping
exit
upd
uninst
exec
shell
flist
fget
fput

The implant is able to perform any classic operation in support of activities aimed at espionage, such
as collecting data relating to the machine in which it is operating, downloading and transferring files,
executing arbitrary commands, capturing screenshots etc. etc.

CONCLUSIONS
The relations between Russia and Belarus date back in 1991 with the signing of the Belovezh
Accords on the ending of the USSR and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS). In the actual conflict going on in Ukraine more than once Minsk showed its support to
Moscow even if publicly Lukashenko said that he’ll avoid the participation of Belarusian soldiers. In

6/8

case of an escalation it’s likely that Belarus will assist Russia militarily. On the basis of the above,
however, it seems that the Belarusian government is already openly participating in offensive
operations in the cyber domain by protecting Russian interest.
