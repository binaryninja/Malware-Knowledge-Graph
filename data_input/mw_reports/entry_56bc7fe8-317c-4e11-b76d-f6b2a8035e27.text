Container and cloud-based resources are being abused to deploy disruptive tools. The use of
compromised infrastructure has far-reaching consequences for organizations who may unwittingly be
participating in hostile activity against Russian government, military and civilian targets.
Docker Engine honeypots were compromised to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian,
Belarusian and Lithuanian websites in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
Both Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine governmentbacked Ukraine IT Army (UIA).
The two images have been downloaded over 150,000 times, but CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot assess
how many of these downloads originate from compromised infrastructure.
CrowdStrike customers are protected from this threat with the CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Workload
Protection module.
Between February 27 and March 1, 2022, Docker Engine honeypots were observed to have been
compromised in order to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian and Belarusian websites in a
denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Both Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the
Ukraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA). The UIA previously called its members to perform
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian targets. There may be risk of retaliatory activity by
threat actors supporting the Russian Federation, against organizations being leveraged to unwittingly conduct
disruptive attacks against government, military and civilian websites.

Initial Compromise via Exposed Docker Engine
1/4

The honeypot was compromised via an exposed Docker Engine API, a technique that is commonly used by
opportunistic campaigns such as LemonDuck or WatchDog to infect misconfigured container engines.

Technical Analysis
The first Docker image that was observed — called abagayev/stop-russia — is hosted on Docker Hub. This
image has been downloaded over 100,000 times, but CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot assess how many of
these downloads originate from compromised infrastructure. The Docker image contains a Go-based HTTP
benchmarking tool named bombardier with SHA256 hash

that uses HTTP-based requests to stress-test a website. In this case, this tool was abused as a DoS tool that
starts automatically when a new container based on the Docker image is created. Upon starting, the targetselection routine picks a random entry from a hard-coded target list. Later versions of this Docker image
alternatively pick one of the first 24 entries of the target list, based on the current hour.

Figure 1. Excerpt of targeted websites

The deployed image was updated once on March 1, 2022. The most significant difference between the two
versions of this image is that the target list was expanded. The target list contains Russian websites from the
following sectors: government, military, media, finance, energy, retail, mining, manufacturing, chemicals,
production, technology, advertisements, agriculture, transportation and political parties. Also on March 1, 2022,
Belarusian websites from the media, retail, government and military sectors were added to the target list.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the activity deploying this Docker image as very likely automated based on
closely overlapping timelines in the interaction with the Docker API. This assessment is made with moderate
confidence, based on three separate incidents showing analogous timelines.
The second Docker image is named erikmnkl/stoppropaganda . This image has been downloaded over
50,000 times from Docker Hub. Again, the portion of these downloads that originated from compromised
machines is unknown. The image contains a custom Go-based DoS program named stoppropaganda that
has the following SHA256 hash

that sends HTTP GET requests to a list of target websites that overloads them with requests. The attack
focused on Russian and Belarusian websites in the same sectors: government, military, energy, mining, retail,
media and finance. Furthermore, three Lithuanian media websites fell victim to the attack.

CrowdStrike Detection
The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform protects its customers with its runtime protection and cloud machine
learning models from any post-exploitation activities. As can be seen in Figure 3, the malicious DoS process
from the erikmnkl/stoppropaganda image gets terminated by Falcon’s cloud-based machine learning
model, when running the Docker container on a host with the Falcon Sensor for Linux installed.

Assessment
Both Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed
UIA that called its members to perform DDoS attacks against Russian targets. CrowdStrike Intelligence
assesses these actors almost certainly compromised the honeypots to support pro-Ukrainian DDoS attacks.
This assessment is made with high confidence based on the targeted websites.

CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Descriptions
High Confidence – Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in
the quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an
absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.

3/4

Moderate Confidence – Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of
sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is
used to express that judgments carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is
available or corroborated.
Low Confidence – Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too
fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is
untested. Further information is needed for corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.
