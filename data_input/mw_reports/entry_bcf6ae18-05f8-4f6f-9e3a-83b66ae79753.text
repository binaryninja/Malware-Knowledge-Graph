If you go strictly by the daily news headlines, you'd think that the majority of current
cybercrime issues were limited to just a few ‘hot’ areas such as China, Russia and Iran.
This is far from the truth, and in fact, there has always been a great deal of concerning
activity that originates from outside these ‘hot’ areas. One such area is the nation of
Nigeria.
When you think of Nigeria and cybercrime, the ﬁrst thing that pops into your mind is
probably the familiar Nigerian “419” scams. Those enticing emails that promise huge
sums of money while scamming victims out of ‘advance fees’ and personal data have
become something of a punchline these days. Despite being well known, they still
persist and often succeed, but in reality, these are just a minor percentage of the total
cybercrime activity coming out of Nigeria.
For years now there has been a more serious Nigeria-based cyberscam with a rotating
cast of actors and groups. The goal of this cyberscam is primarily ﬁnancial gain, with
disruption of business as a welcome side beneﬁt. The potential, however, exists for
more severe actions, in terms of physical compromise or destruction of property, cargo
and possibly even human life.
While this activity has received a decent amount of coverage in the past, Cylance’s
Research Team decided to take a closer look.

Nigerian Scams Grow in Sophistication

Nigerian Scams Grow in Sophistication
Cylance’s investigation concentrated on an ongoing campaign out of Nigeria, primarily
targeting high-impact industries in India. In particular: manufacturing, shipping,
freight/cargo logistics, and transportation companies were targeted.
The immediate gain from these attacks for the cybercriminals is access to a wealth of
ﬁnancial data. By leveraging credential-stealing tools such as Pony and Hawkeye, the
attackers are able to gain access to personal and corporate email accounts as well as
breaching corporate intranets and VPNs.
But rather than simply stealing data wholesale and selling it online to the highest
bidder, the attackers do something unusual: they manually read through the mail in the
compromised email accounts, searching for further targets (both personal and
corporate) which they can leverage to inﬁltrate other companies or siphon money from.
The level of detail to which the attackers are privy after accessing corporate email
accounts is alarming. Sensitive data including employee records, banking transactions,
vehicle or ocean vessel tracking info, and standard intellectual property were all
targeted and exﬁltrated by this group.
There have been multiple ‘waves’ observed in these attacks, primarily spanning from
October 2015 to June 2016. With the Pony Loader 2.2 infrastructure in place, the
attackers were able to begin the initial stages of attack. This was typically carried out
via a standard spear-phish email to individuals in targeted companies. The messages
all have invoice, cargo or shipment inquiry themes, and are sent from registered
domains that look very similar to the domains of legitimate companies with whom the
target companies typically do business.
For example:

Figure 1: Phishing Email 1 - Bogus Cargo Inquiry (With Malicious Attachment)

Figure 2: Phishing Email 2 - Bogus Account Details Conﬁrmation (With Malicious Attachment)

The spear-phish emails are weaponized with either .BZ or .ACE compressed
executables (extracting to either .EXE or .SCR ﬁles).
Those attachments are Pony or Hawkeye trojans, which are then used to steal even
more credentials and data from the targets. Once the cybercriminals have actual
legitimate credentials to work with, they send further spear-phish emails to additional
targets manually identiﬁed from the compromised accounts.

In some cases, Hawkeye and Pony are sent in the same email, as per the example in
Figure 4, below:

Pony & Hawkeye Trojan Attachments

Panels and Infrastructure

Cylance's primary investigative focus with these campaigns has been the wave which
started in early April 2016, and (as of this writing) is still ongoing in June 2016. In early
April, the attackers set up their main infrastructure via Unlimited Web Hosting out of the
UK. Multiple registered domains were immediately used to set up Pony Loader panels
and host associated malware:
Initial Registered Domains:
cosmoships-gr(dot)com
equinoxdsitribution(dot)com
etaship-sg(dot)com
fortressict-nl(dot)com
friendshlp-chartering(dot)com

toships(dot)net
tosihps(dot)com
toslhips(dot)com
toslhps(dot)com
vietexcurisons(dot)com
alexbensonship(dot)com
The longest running panels (now down as of 6/14/2016) were hosted on nqvoilsg(dot)com, and pcchand(dot)com. Pony C2s were brieﬂy active on friendshipchartering(dot)com, toships(dot)net, and tosihps(dot)com. Both the Pony-hosting
domains, and those not hosting Pony were observed sending out weaponized email
messages, directing victims to one of the active Pony C2s:

Figure 9: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 5

Armed with ample sets of credentials, the attackers now have access to an enormous
amount of sensitive information. This is perhaps the biggest takeaway of this post. Even
if the attackers were only interested in the ﬁnancial data, of which there is plenty, the
potential for ﬁnancial and physical damage via leveraging other segments of acquired
data is alarming.
Not only do the cybercriminals have access to critical ﬁnancial data such as account
numbers, transaction IDs, bank routing numbers, SWIFT codes, IBAN codes, and so
on, but in this case the attackers also have direct access to vehicle, shipping, and cargo
logistics data. This data ranges from the routes and locations of delivery truck ﬂeets, all
the way to routing and cargo of commercial and government marine vessels. Examples
of ﬁnancial and transportation data, gathered/ monitored by the attacker, are given
below:

Malware Used in the Attacks

Malware Used in the Attacks
The attackers are utilizing Pony Loader 2.2 almost exclusively for these attacks. There
are a few speciﬁc targets where Hawkeye and/or Zeus came into play, but most of the
focus and beneﬁt comes from Pony. The Pony malware is purpose-built to harvest a
prescribed set of credentials and data from the victim’s machine. Pony 2.2 is capable of
harvesting RDP, HTTP/HTTP, FTP, SFTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP as well as bitcoin
(including Electrum and Multibit modules).
The bitcoin theft modules are relatively new to Pony Loader. That is to say, the
functionality related to theft of cryptocurrencies was introduced ﬁrst in version 2.0 of
Pony Loader. The password stealing modules are (in standard Pony fashion) also
speciﬁc to certain products.
Global Password Module List:

Figure 19: Global Password Module List - 3

The RDP Capture module can be seen below, along with portions of the bitcoin
processing modules:

Figure 20: RDP Capture Module -1

Below, we see how credentials are constructed from the data submitted from infected
clients:

Figure 21: RDP Capture Module - 2

Pony Loader stores data in a local MySQL database. This functionality is outlined in
database.php on the server hosting the Pony DB:

Figure 22: Pony Loader SQL Database

Here we actually see an example of the attacker leaving the MySQL credentials

Here we actually see an example of the attacker leaving the MySQL credentials
exposed (in the clear) in the server’s conﬁg.php:

Figure 23: MySQL Credentials - Exposed

Upon execution, Pony Loader will attempt to identify speciﬁc AV products running on
the victim's machine, for evasion purposes. In the analyzed examples, the binaries are
looking to identify running instances of antivirus products from the following companies:
* Bitdefender
* Kaspersky
* AVG
Pony binaries (associated with these campaigns) do not stray from the natively built
binaries generated by the Pony Builder, with one exception. Some of the binaries are
encrypted with an off-the-shelf Crypter tool called DarkEyE Protector:

Figure 24: DarkEyE Protector Logo

In one example we looked at, the license for DarkEyE Protector is bound to /
associated with the email address lakashop25(at)gmail.com. (Visible as artifact
embedded in the malware binary). That same email address is associated with the
hosting of the Pony C2 domains.

Figure 25: Domain Hosting Purchase Showing Use of Email Address: lakashop(at)gmail.com

If we go back to some of the initial spear-phish campaigns, we can actually ﬁnd one
where that same email account was used to send the infected message:

Attribution
There are many aspects that point to Nigeria above and beyond the by-the-book
modus operandi outlined in both this write-up and some of the past efforts previously
referenced.
We also observed that most of the logins to the various Pony admin panels were
tagged as being in Nigeria:

Figure 27: Pony Admin Panel Showing Logins From Nigeria

We also see consistent reuse of user names and passwords that reference Nigerian
culture. These accounts appear consistently among the compromised accounts as well
within the actual administrative credentials to Pony admin panels.
For example, one particular actor uses several variations of “waxxy” which is a
reference to the popular Nigerian DJ known as DJ Waxxy.
EX: waxxy3:waxxysomuch
EX: waxxy3:vgwbnpcnra
EX: waxxy3:louiss33
We also see several recurring uses of “chukwuka123” and “chukwuka”. “chukwuka” is
a reference to the popular Nigerian actress Chioma Chukwuka:

Figure 28: Chioma Chukwuka, Whose Name is Often Used as a Password

The term “chukwuka” is more frequently used as the password to some of the Pony
admin panels, but appears as a modiﬁed password for compromised accounts as well.
Going back to the speciﬁc attribution side, we can do a little more digging around these
terms to ﬁnd OSINT pointing to speciﬁc individuals acting as part of this cybercrime
group.
One particular username and associated email account pops up far more frequently
than others. The “onyeb4real” user name is frequently observed setting up
dummy/burner email accounts and using them to send out either weaponized
messages, or text-only social engineering lures in attempts to lure victims into either
running malicious code, or visiting sites hosting malicious code.
Examples are listed below (exact URLs obfuscated):

h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@signin.exxxxxxxxxxxxxomSAPI.dll
h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@xxxxxxxxxxxxxomgin.php
Oftentimes, the “onyeb4real” string is coupled with “louis33”. If we refer to the "waxxy"
references outlined above, we see that there are also couplings of “louiss” (and
variations of it) and both “onyeb4real” and "waxxy".
A little OSINT digging reveals numerous proﬁles of a speciﬁc Nigerian individual names
“Louis” with a frequent handle of Waxxy or Waxxy3. The email address tied to this
individual’s social media accounts is: onyeb4real(at)gmail.com.

Figure 29: Instagram Account of Louis - AKA “Waxxy” 1

When cross-referencing publicly available information on this individual, we are able to
collect numerous fragments of data that solidify the location of this particular actor. In
the example below, we see a classiﬁed advert selling a used Blackberry:

The Test – CylancePROTECT® vs. Pony Loader &
Hawkeye
All of these compromises require that a Pony or Hawkeye binary be executed on the
target host. It is therefore critical that any protective or preventative controls on the
hosts completely prevent that binary from being executed. Now that we see how much
sensitive information a small group of cybercriminals can get access to using simple
stolen email credentials, we can understand how vital it is to prevent this simple theft
from happening. Unfortunately, that is not always possible with traditional, signaturebased, technologies running on the endpoint.
It is important to point out that some of the samples we analyzed were not ‘publically
available’ at the time of analysis. That is to say, there were not available on any of the

available’ at the time of analysis. That is to say, there were not available on any of the
popular, multi-engine, scanning and analysis services which many legacy antivirus
technologies and vendors rely on. Having to rely on third party services or quickly
outdated signatures is not an option if you wish to prevent these kinds of attacks from
occurring.
Cylance tested over 30 samples associated with these attacks using our AI based
endpoint protection solution CylancePROTECT. CylancePROTECT stopped all of them
cold, pre-execution. End of story.
The following samples were tested against CylancePROTECT:
