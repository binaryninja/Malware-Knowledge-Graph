A phishing kit has been released that allows red teamers and wannabe cybercriminals to
create effective single sign-on phishing login forms using fake Chrome browser windows.
When signing into websites, it is common to see the option to sign with Google, Microsoft,
Apple, Twitter, or even Steam.
For example, the login form for DropBox allows you to login using an Apple or Google
account, as shown below.

DropBox login form
When clicking the Login in Google or App buttons, a single-sign-on (SSO) browser window
will be displayed, prompting you to enter your credentials and login with the account.
These Windows are stripped down to only show the login form and an address bar showing
the URL of the login form.

Legitimate sign in with Google window
While this address bar is disabled in these SSO windows, you can still use the displayed
URL to verify that a legitimate google.com domain is being used to sign you into the site.
This URL further adds to the trust of the form and will make you feel comfortable entering
your login credentials.
Threat actors have attempted to create these fake SSO windows using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript in the past, but there is usually something a little off about the windows, making
them look suspicious.

Introducing Browser in the Browser attacks
This is where a new "Browser in the Browser (BitB) Attack" comes into play that uses
premade templates to create fake but realistic, Chrome popup windows that includes custom
address URLs and titles that can be used in phishing attacks.
Basically, this attack creates fake browser windows within real browser windows (Browser in
the Browser) to create convincing phishing attacks.

The Browser in the Browser attack templates was created by security researcher mr.d0x,
who released the templates on GitHub. These templates include those for Google Chrome
for Windows and Mac and dark and light mode variants.

mr.d0x told BleepingComputer that the templates are very simple to use in creating
convincing Chrome windows to display single sign-on login forms for any online platform.
The researcher said that redteamers could simply download the templates, edit them to
contain the desired URL and Window title, and then use an iframe to display the login form.
It is also possible to add the HTML for the login form directly into the template, but mr.d0x
told BleepingComputer that you would need to align the form properly using CSS and HTML.
Kuba Gretzky, the creator of the Evilginx phishing toolkit, tested the new method and showed
how it worked perfectly with the Evilginx platform, meaning it could be adapted to steal 2FA
keys during phishing attacks.

Spoofing the reverse-proxied Sec-Fetch-Dest value to "document" worked like a charm
and it's beautiful
Evilginx loves it!

mr.d0x told BleepingComputer that this is not a new technique and that Zscaler reported it
being used by fake gaming sites in 2020 to steal Steam credentials.
Huh, looks like Steam scams are evolving. Someone tried phishing me with this really
clever fake Steam login page earlier today, which mostly failed because I opened the
window on my small second monitor. Watch out, everyone.

However, now that premade templates for fake Chrome windows are available, redteamers
can use them to create convincing phishing sign-in forms to test the defense of their clients
or their own company's employees.
For those who wish to try out the new Browser in the Browser phishing attack, you can grab
the templates from GitHub.
