Ransomware is a type of extortion attack that destroys or encrypts files and folders,
preventing access to critical data. Commodity ransomware typically spreads like a virus that
infects devices and only requires malware remediation. Human-operated ransomware is the
result of an active attack by cybercriminals that infiltrate an organization’s on-premises or
cloud IT infrastructure, elevate their privileges, and deploy ransomware to critical data.
These “hands-on-keyboard” attacks target an organization rather than a single device and
leverage human attackers’ knowledge of common system and security misconfigurations to
infiltrate the organization, navigate the enterprise network, and adapt to the environment and
its weaknesses as they go. Hallmarks of these human-operated ransomware attacks
typically include credential theft and lateral movement and can result in deployment of a
ransomware payload to high business impact resources the attackers choose.

These attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up,
requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity
ransomware that only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware will
continue to threaten your business operations after the initial encounter.
This figure shows how this extortion-based attack that uses maintenance and security
configuration gaps and privileged access is growing in impact and likelihood.

Protect your organization against ransomware and extortion
For a comprehensive view of ransomware and extortion and how to protect your
organization, use the information in the Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project
Plan PowerPoint presentation.
Here's a summary of the guidance:

The stakes of ransomware and extortion-based attacks are high.
However, the attacks have weaknesses that can mitigate your likelihood of being
attacked.
There are three phases to configure your infrastructure to exploit attack weaknesses.
For the three phases to exploit attack weaknesses, see the Protect your organization against
ransomware and extortion solution to quickly configure your IT infrastructure for the best
protection:
1. Prepare your organization to recover from an attack without having to pay the ransom.
2. Limit the scope of damage of an attack by protecting privileged roles.
3. Make it harder for an attacker to get into your environment by incrementally removing
risks.

Download the Protect your organization from ransomware poster for an overview of the three
phases as layers of protection against ransomware attackers.
