Questions concerning responsibility for the current epidemic of ransomware events are
common, and seek to identify some concrete party to hold accountable for incidents. Yet the
immediate perpetrators – largely (but not exclusively) criminal gangs operating in Eastern
Europe and Russia – either represent too remote an entity for blame, or remain inaccessible
from any consequences for their behavior. The latter point is interesting, and gives rise to
theories that state entities, especially Russian authorities, overlook the operations of these
groups to further their own notionally disruptive ends.
As previously discussed, ransomware operations contain at least as many, if not more, risks
for state entities as benefits. Yet we should not assume all authorities employ accurate or
especially deep risk calculations. Therefore, irrespective of actual benefit, we are faced with
the interface between criminal entities and state authorities. That state entities are involved
in ransomware operations is beyond doubt – such has been strongly suggested if not proven
in cases like ColdLock, more recent Exchange exploitation, and the WannaCry event, and

reasonably considered in cases such as the LockerGoga incident at Norsk Hydro. Yet the
question of state control or responsibility for such operations when conducted by criminals in
permissive environments is more vexing.
Recent, in-depth reporting from Recorded Future implies that links between Russian criminal
entities and state authorities are rather robust and derive from long-standing links between
state intelligence services and criminal actors. The report is quite thorough in gathering and
evaluating evidence, but conclusions bear further scrutiny. Notably, a significant tension
exists between instances where members of the Russian criminal ecosystem were very
directly co-opted by state entities, and looser relationships where the existence of such
entities is merely permitted for one of a number of reasons. While the effects of such activity
may be the same, the reasons behind such actions are drastically different, and should be
taken into account when evaluating the degree of state culpability in ransomware operations.
At this time, we should familiarize ourselves with a concept long known but seldom
recognized in cyber operations and intelligence analysis: the spectrum of state responsibility
for cyber incidents. Originally distilled by Jason Healey and since refined or expounded on by
others, the idea posits that state association with cyber events is not a binary proposition.
Instead, there exist many degrees of state involvement in cyber-nexus events:

As seen in the list above, responsibility ranges from willingness (but inability) to block or
interrupt cyber events emerging from their territory to benign neglect to active
encouragement to direct involvement in operations. While the above represents merely a
model of activity, it remains instructive by showing analysts and others that many gradations
exist defining state interaction with cyber events.
In some cases – potentially most notable with lack of action by Nigerian authorities against
Business Email Compromise (BEC) entities operating in their country – states may lack the
institutional ability to effectively respond (without significant external assistance) to malicious
activity originating from their territory. In others, presumably criminal operations may be
subsumed within or represent extensions of state-directed operations. Yet neither case
appears to apply to Russian-nexus cybercrime operations. While the Russian state may
have persistent issues dealing with criminality, the country remains a vaguely authoritarian
society with democratic trappings – meaning if ransomware gangs were a point of particular

interest, they could (and likely would) be efficiently dealt with by authorities. At the other
extreme, a state able to execute such exquisite intrusions and reasonably deniable events
ranging from SUNBURST to NotPetya would appear to have little use for indiscriminate
ransomware operations as a tool of state policy given other available options.
Based on the above, any assessment of Russian government culpability for ransomware
operations must first determine, just what level of action (or inaction) establishes
responsibility? If the measure of responsibility hinges on negative observations (i.e., neglect
or avoidance), then we must also determine whether such actions are out of deliberate
ignorance or more general institutional failure. If we posit that the Russian state is in firm
control of its society, then ransomware operators functioning without sanction would appear
to be a very deliberate choice by the Russian state. However, Russia sadly appears to be a
polity afflicted by corruption, state and institutional capture, and collisions between ruling
authority and popular interests. In such an environment, legal sanction for entities operating
almost exclusively outside the territory of the state would appear to be either a low priority –
or one of a number of opportunities for enrichment through bribes and other mechanisms.
From the above, we must ask, given the diseased institutional state of the Russian
Federation, whether the entity even has the capacity to reign in ransomware operators.
While collaborations between intelligence entities and criminal elements may continue to
take place for various opportunistic reasons, wholesale disruption and shutdown of entities
primarily impacting non-Russian entities would appear a low priority for authorities within the
compromised state. Looking back to our spectrum of state responsibility, while Russian
authorities appear to aspire to and occasionally reach higher levels of interaction with
respect to their criminal underground, more often than not institutional failures and limitations
mean such criminal activities take place irrespective of state agreement or disapproval.
Thus imaging a grand conspiracy of Russian-directed ransomware operations against EU
and North American entities as a sort of covert disruptive exercise appears nonsensical. At
best, Russian authorities retain weak (if any) authority over such groups, exercised only in
those rare occasions when a truly critical (e.g. domestic) interest is threatened. At worst, the
Russian cybercrime scene resembles a Hobbesian war of all against all, so long as effects
are not significantly felt domestically, a nearly failed state can do little but watch idly while
pursuing more immediate existential threats.
We may find it intellectually comforting to think that some grand conspiracy lies behind the
disruptive events that impact entities ranging from hospitals to school districts to everyday
commerce. Yet the totality of available evidence and understanding of circumstances
overwhelmingly suggests a significant distance between Russian state authority designs and
the predations of Russian-based criminal enterprises. Searching for a singular, allencompassing “bad guy” to blame for events is a common feature of the human condition.
But in the case of ransomware operations, events are too diffuse and complex to support
such attribution.
