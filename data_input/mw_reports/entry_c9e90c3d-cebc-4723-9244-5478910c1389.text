Introduction
Below we’ve outlined the delivery phase of some recent attacks by KeyBoy, a group of attackers
believed to operate out of China. They were first identified in 2013 targeting governments and
NGOs in South East Asia. Their primary targeting continues to this day, though they have also been
known to target more diverse victims such as the energy sector.

Malware Delivery through Open Source Exploit Kits
KeyBoy sent the following email to India's Ambassador to Ethiopia from an email address at nic[.]in,
India's National Informatics Centre.

1/7

The file f43f60b62002d0700ccbcbd9334520b6
The attached malicious document downloads and executes a script that installs the final payload:

This script contains text (eg; “” ) which matches a pre-packed version of the popular CVE-20170199 exploit available on GitHub.

We’ve seen other malicious documents where KeyBoy have tested another exploit generator. In
that case KeyBoy didn’t change the default settings so the document meta-data provides some
obvious hints that the document is malicious:

Delivered Malware
The next stage in these attacks is typically a malware family known as TSSL. This malware
originally identified by PwC and more recently described by Trend Micro and CitizenLab.
Most samples are built on the attackers machine from the location:
D:Work...
Though the build path of a recent sample seems to indicate the attackers are having problems
bypassing Symantec antivirus, and is built from:
C:UsersCN_ideDesktopTSSL_v3.2.7_BypassSymantec_20180528TClientReleaseFakeRun.pdb

Delivering Android Malware
We’ve also noted continued infections of the Titan Android malware associated with Keyboy,
originally identified by LookOut. The source of the files that we have managed to identify is old - and
seems to date back to a user named Textplus0012 posting malicious APK files on a Taiwanese site
(apk.tw) for downloading Android applications:

The user textplus0012 on apk.tw
This user stopped posting the malicious files in 2015. It is unclear where samples of Titan were
delivered from after this.

Detection
AlienVault Agent Detections
The AlienVault Agent is a lightweight, adaptable endpoint agent based on osquery and maintained
by AlienVault.
The AlienVault Agent detects the following malicious activity during the attacks:
Suspicious Process Created by Microsoft Office Application
Powershell Process Created by Scripting Executable
Suspicious PowerShell Arguments
PowerShell process with suspicious arguments and network activity
Network Detection
ETPRO INFO DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.dynamic-dns.net Domain
