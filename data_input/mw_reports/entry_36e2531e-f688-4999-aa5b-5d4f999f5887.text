Executive Summary
In late May, 2021, Microsoft and Volexity released public reports detailing recent
Nobelium activity.
Nobelium is suspected to be the new face of APT29 (aka The Dukes). We track this
activity under the name ‘NobleBaron’.
This campaign employs a convoluted multi-stage infection chain, five to six layers
deep.
Most custom downloaders leverage Cobalt Strike Beacon in-memory as a mechanism
to drop more elusive payloads on select victims.
This report focuses on NobleBaron’s ‘DLL_stageless’ downloaders (aka NativeZone)
SentinelLabs has discovered the use of one of these DLL_stageless downloaders as
part of a poisoned update installer for electronic keys used by the Ukrainian
government.
At this time, the means of distribution are unknown. It’s possible that these update
archives are being used as part of a regionally-specific supply chain attack.
We uncovered additional unreported DLL_stageless downloaders.

Overview
1/8

After the extensive revelations of Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage activities over
the past five years, teams like APT28 (aka FancyBear, STRONTIUM) and APT29 (aka
CozyBear, The Dukes) have retooled and reorganized extensively to avoid easy tracking by
Western governments and security vendors alike. The operations of ‘APT29’ no longer look
anything like they did in the past half decade. At this point our preconceptions about these
groups are doing more to cloud our judgment than they elucidate. Perhaps new naming
conventions (like ‘NOBELIUM’ or ‘StellarParticle’) will help piece these new clusters of
activity apart– all the while upsetting folks who would prefer a simpler threat landscape than
the one our reality affords us.
We track this new activity under the name ‘NobleBaron’, building off of the excellent reporting
by Microsoft and Volexity. We acknowledge the suspicion that this is a newer iteration of
APT29 but share in the general trepidation to equate the two. While the aforementioned
companies have done excellent work exposing the inner workings of this activity, we wanted
to contribute additional variants we encountered in our follow-on research, including a
curious particularly insidious packaging of the ‘NativeZone’ downloader as part of a poisoned
installer for a Ukrainian cryptographic smartkey used in government operations.

A Convoluted Infection Chain
As noted by Microsoft, the actor appears to be experimenting with various multi-stage
infection chains. Common variations include the method of delivering the ISO containers and
a wide variety of custom downloaders enmeshed with Cobalt Strike Beacon. There’s a vague
mention of an iOS zero-day being hosted on Nobelium fingerprinting servers but no mention
as to whether this entails an iOS payload. That said, we also suspect no company is in a
position to monitor iPhone endpoints for these payloads, Apple included.

While the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload is a disappointingly ubiquitous end for such a
convoluted infection chain, it’s not in fact the end of that chain. Rather, it serves as an early
scout that enables selective distribution of rarer payloads directly into memory where they’re
2/8

less likely to be detected. A similar technique was employed by HackingTeam’s Remote
Control System (RCS) where initial infections used their ‘Scout’ malware for initial recon and
could then be selectively upgraded to the full ‘Elite’ payload. After years of burned iterations
on custom toolkits, it seems NobleBaron has opted for maximizing return on investment by
simply lowering their upfront investment.
Notable TTPs include the following:
An increasing depth in multi-layer droppers (a concept briefly described by Steve Miller
and worth exploring further) particularly with regard to the inevitable CS Beacon
payload.
The use of large size files to avoid detection by security solutions with hardcoded size
limits for ‘efficiency’.
A fishing-with-dynamite approach to collecting initial access to victims with low-cost
tooling. The SolarWinds supply chain attack is one such example of starting with a
wide victim pool and whittling down to high-value targets.

Internal Name
KM.FileSystem.dll
File Description
ІІТ Бібліотека роботи з НКІ типу: "файлова система" (Ukrainian)

Most notably, one of these NativeZone downloaders is being used as part of a clever
poisoned installer targeting Ukrainian government security applications. A zip file is used to
package legitimate components alongside a malicious DLL ( KM.Filesystem.dll ). The
malicious KM.Filesystem.dll was crafted to impersonate a legitimate component of the
Ukrainian Institute of Technology’s cryptographic keys of the same name. It even mimics the
same two exported functions as the original.

3/8

KM.Filesystem.dll exported functions
The package is not an ISO, but it follows a familiar formula. ‘ScanClientUpdate.zip’ relies on
a triad of sorts. An LNK is used to kick off the malicious KM.FileSystem.dll component.
In turn, KM.FileSystem.dll starts by checking for presence of KM.EkeyAlmaz1C.dll (a
benign DLL). This check is presumably meant as an anti-sandbox technique that would keep
this downloader from executing unless it’s in the same directory as the other packaged
components.

ScanClientUpdate.zip

contents
We stop short of referring to this as a supply chain attack since we lack visibility into its
means of distribution. The poisoned installer may be delivered directly to relevant victims that
rely on this regional solution. Alternatively, the attackers may have found a way of abusing
an internal resource to distribute their malicious ‘update’.

LNK starter command to run the malicious DLL
The LNK starter invokes the KMGetInterface export to execute the malware’s functionality.
It passes a benign Windows component as an argument ( ComputerDefaults.exe ). The
attackers will use the file’s attributes later on.
Upon execution, the user is presented with a vague ‘Success’ message box.

4/8

Note that the heading of the message box is ‘ASKOD’, a reference to the Ukrainian
electronic document management system. This initiative is meant to enforce electronic digital
signatures through the use of cryptographic keys like the Алмаз-1К (transliterated as ‘Almaz1K’ or translated to ‘Diamond-1K’) shown below.

Алмаз-1К electronic key description
These particular electronic keys are referenced in Ukrainian government tenders and make
for a cunning regional-specific lure to distribute malware.
After displaying the message box, the malicious DLL proceeds to resolve APIs by hash and
decrypts its payload directly into memory. You guessed it: Cobalt Strike Beacon v4.

5/8

It then decrypts the configuration via single-byte XOR 0x2E and attempts to establish
contact with the command-and-control server doggroomingnews[.]com . It checks for
‘/storage/main.woff2’ and if necessary falls back to ‘/storage/page.woff2’ . The
domain resolves to an IP address in Ukraine ( 45.135.167.27 ), which appears to be a
compromised domain.
While we have not been able to fetch the response at this time, it’s worth noting that this
same IP was also contacted by a Cobalt Strike Beacon sample in late 2020:

These malicious updates are distributed in zip archives. At this time, we’ve discovered two
‘ScanClientUpdate.zip’ samples, both containing the same malicious DLL:

Analyzing GraphicalComponent.dll led to the discovery of another DLL_stageless
sample. At this time, we have not discovered the delivery mechanism. The name suggests
the possibility of a different poisoned installer, with a focus on the Java SRE runtime.
