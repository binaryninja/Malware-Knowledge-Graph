APT41 likely behind massive supply chain attack
Nikita Rostovcev
Threat Intelligence analyst at Group-IB
On March 4, 2021, SITA, an international provider of IT services for the air transport industry worldwide, said it had suffered a security
incident. The announcement, however, was not getting the attention it deserved until Air India, one of SITA's customers, reported a
massive passenger data breach on May 21 caused by an earlier attack against SITA. Between March and May, various airline companies,
including Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and others, disclosed data breaches. All of those companies were SITA customers.
After Air India revealed the details of its security breach, it became clear that the carriers were most likely dealing with one of the biggest
supply chain attacks in the airline industry's history.
Using its external threat hunting tools, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team attributed the Air India incident with moderate confidence
to the Chinese nation-state threat actor known as APT41. The campaign was codenamed ColunmTK.

Big airline heist: APT41 likely behind massive supply chain attack

The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in
their networks are significant. To help companies detect and hunt for ColunmTK, we have provided a full list of indicators of
compromise (IOCs) that we retrieved. MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE Shield, and recommendations are available at the end of this blog post.
Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team informed CERT India and Air India of its findings so that they can take the necessary steps to
mitigate the threat.
Background
On May 21, Air India, India's flag carrier, published an official statement on their website about a data breach. The announcement
revealed that the breach was caused by a February incident at the airline's IT service provider, SITA PSS, which is responsible for
processing customers' personally identifiable information (PII). It came to light that the SITA cyberattack affected 4,500,000 data
subjects globally, including data related to Air India's customers.
Shortly after Air India's public announcement, the database allegedly related to their security breach was put up for sale on an
underground market at USD 3,000.
According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the alleged database was published on a fraudulent resource known
for reselling data that has been published on various data-leak websites. Because the database had never surfaced anywhere on the dark
web, nor in the public domain, Group-IB researchers considered it fake and decided to instead look deeper into what had been known
about the actual attack and discovered that the post about listing with Air India's alleged data had nothing to do with what happened in
reality. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team soon realized that they were dealing with a sophisticated nation-state threat actor, rather
than another financially motivated cybercriminal group.
Compromise of Air India's network
In mid-February 2021, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected infected devices that were part of Air India's
computer network. Starting from at least February 23, 2021, a device inside the company's network communicated with a server with
the IP address 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. According to Group-IB's Network Graph, this server has hosted Cobalt Strike, a popular postexploitation framework, since December 11, 2020 (we will come back to it a little later).

Lifetime of a Cobalt Strike tag in Group-IB's Network Graph
The patient zero that started communicating with the C&C server was a device named SITASERVER4 with the local IP address
172[.]16[.]11[.]103. Based on how it is named, it is fair to assume that the device is related to a SITA data processing server.
After the attackers established persistence in the network and obtained passwords, they began moving laterally. The threat actor
collected information inside the local network, including names of network resources and their addresses.
Below are examples of commands that were used for lateral movement:

The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz.The attackers
tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware. BadPotatoNet4.exe was uploaded to one of the devices inside the
victim's network under the name SecurityHealthSystray.exe. According to our data, at least 20 devices from Air India's network were
compromised during the lateral movement stage. The attackers used DNS-txt requests to connect the bots to the C&C server. The
following domains were used for DNS tunneling.

ns2[.]colunm[.]tk;
ns1[.]colunm[.]tk.

The name of the campaign, ColunmTK, is derived from these initially discovered domains.
It was also found that the attackers extracted 23,339,032 bytes of data from the following devices:
SITASERVER4
AILCCUALHSV001
AILDELCCPOSCE01
AILDELCCPDB01
WEBSERVER3
According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution data, the compromised devices were located in different subnets, which may
indicate that the compromise affected various segments of Air India's network.
According to Group-IB's records, the attack on Air India lasted for at least 2 months and 26 days. It took the attackers 24 hours and 5
minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline's network.
ColunmTK Timeline
The initial attack vector remains unknown. However, the evidence showing that the first device that started communicating with the
adversary-controlled C&C server was a SITA server and the fact that SITA notified Air India about its security incident give reasonable
ground to believe that the compromise of Air India's network was the result of a sophisticated supply chain attack, which might have
started with SITA. If this conclusion is true, it would affect other SITA customers, which the company claims make up about 90% of the
world's airline businesses.

Big airline heist: APT41 likely behind massive supply chain attack

Group-IB researchers believe with moderate confidence that the ColunmTK campaign was carried out by APT41, a prolific Chinesespeaking nation-state threat actor. APT41, also known as WICKED SPIDER (PANDA), Winnti Umbrella, and BARIUM, is believed to
have been engaging in state-sponsored espionage in China's interests as well as committing financially motivated cybercrimes.
According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the threat actor has been active since at least 2007.
APT41 is known for stealing digital certificates for its cyber espionage operations. India is a frequent target of Chinese nation-state
adversaries.
When analyzing the network infrastructure of the C&C-server involved in the cyberattack against Air India, Group-IB's Threat
Intelligence & Attribution system revealed that the threat actor used a specific SSL certificate, which was detected on five hosts only.

Network relations between hosts with a specific fingerprint presented in Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system
Let's take a closer look at these five IP addresses.
One of them, 45[.]61[.]136[.]199, was attributed to APT41(aka Barium) by Microsoft in their recent research.
It is worth looking at another IP address from the list: 104[.]224[.]169[.]214. This IP address was used as an A record for two domains:
server04[.]dns04[.]com and service04[.]dns04[.]com. The IP address was also used to host the Cobalt Strike framework and shared an
SSL certificate, b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b, with ColunmTK's IP address 185.118.166[.]66. When analyzing the

dns04[.]com subdomains, we found that these domains were parked at the IP address 127.0.0.1 on the same date: April 15, 2021.
According to Group-IB researchers, APT41 usually parks their domains for some time at 127.0.0.1 after their campaigns are over.
Network relations between hosts parked at 127.0.0.1.

Another interesting domain is service[.]dns22[.]ml. This domain shared the SSL certificate
b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b with ColunmTK's IP address and was parked at 127.0.0.1 on January 15, 2021. Security
researchers found that the IP address 104[.]224[.]169[.]214 was used as the IP address for a shellcode loader in APT41's earlier
campaigns, in which the domain service[.]dns22[.]ml was also used.
Group-IB researchers discovered a file named "Install.bat" (SHA1-7185bb6f1dddca0e6b5a07b357529e2397cdee44). The file was
uploaded by the attackers to some of the compromised devices inside Air India's network as part of the ColunmTK campaign. The file is
very similar to one used by APT41 in a different campaign described by FireEye researchers.
In both cases, the files were used to establish persistence in the network. The files are very similar in the way they launch a DLL file as a
service and create keys in the registry.
The contents of the file "install.bat" from APT41's This is Not a Test campaign:
