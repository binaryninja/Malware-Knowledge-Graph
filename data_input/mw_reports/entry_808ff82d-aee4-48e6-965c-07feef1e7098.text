Joint Advisory on ALTDOS
This joint advisory is the result of a collaborative effort between the Cyber Security Agency of
Singapore (CSA), the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the Singapore Police
Force (SPF). Collectively, we have received several reports of cyber incidents involving
organisations operating in Singapore that were reportedly targeted by the threat actor
ALTDOS.
This joint advisory highlights the observed Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
employed by ALTDOS to compromise their victims’ networks and provides some
recommended measures for organisations to mitigate the threat posed.
Background of ALTDOS
ALTDOS first emerged in late 2020 when they claimed their first victim, a securities trading
firm based in Thailand. Thus far, ALTDOS has claimed multiple victims in Bangladesh and
Singapore, in addition to Thailand. The threat actor appears to operate primarily in Southeast
Asia and Bangladesh, targeting businesses for financial gains.

Observed TTPs (and associated IDs) employed by ALTDOS mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
ALTDOS typically uses double extortion techniques to extract ransom from their victims. In
double extortion, data is exfiltrated from the victim’s servers, after which the data may be
encrypted. ALTDOS will subsequently contact the victim using an email address hosted on
protonmail demanding that payment be made or the exfiltrated data will be published (leakand-shame). It is currently unknown which ransomware variant is employed by ALTDOS.
Victims have also been asked to pay a separate ransom if they wish to decrypt any encrypted
files. Similar to other financially motivated threat actors, the ransom is typically paid in Bitcoin.
If the victim does not respond or comply to the ransom demand within the given time frame,
ALTDOS may also launch a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack on the victim’s Internet facing
systems to disrupt operational services and to remind them to pay the ransom.
Detection of TTPs
1. Web Server Exploitation
ALTDOS has been observed to exploit vulnerable instances of Apache Web Servers and
employ SQL injection against vulnerable targets to obtain initial access. Besides monitoring
the logs provided by Web Application Firewalls, incident responders can also examine host
process logs for anomalies between parent web server processes and child processes.
Parent processes that should be monitored include those belonging to web servers such as
httpd.exe and php-cgi.exe. Suspicious child processes include those that can be used as
command and scripting interpreters such as powershell.exe, cmd.exe or wscript.exe. When
intruding into a victim’s network, ALTDOS has been observed to exploit the web server where
httpd.exe spawns cmd.exe, enabling arbitrary code execution.
2. Cobalt Strike Beacons
ALTDOS has been observed to primarily employ default Cobalt Strike Beacons that can be
readily identified using open source YARA rules. Please see appended links for the YARA rules:
https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/apt_cobaltstrike.yar
https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/apt_cobaltstrike_evasive.yar

ALTDOS has also been observed to use default Cobalt Strike TLS/SSL certificates. Incident
responders investigating suspicious destination IP/Domains can check the certificate for
suspicious fields such as those appended:

Recommended Mitigations
1. Regular Patching
ALTDOS typically exploits vulnerable instances of web servers to gain initial access to an
organisation’s network. As such, we strongly recommend that organisations regularly update
their softwares (e.g. web server application, database application, etc.) to patch known
security vulnerabilities. Source code reviews also help to detect web application
vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities include those in the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) “Top Ten” list.
2. Regular Log Reviews
ALTDOS has been observed to carry out active scanning to discover vulnerable instances of
web servers. As such, system administrators should enable logging (e.g. server access logs)
and review such logs regularly to spot any malicious activities (e.g. SQLi attempts). If malicious
activities are detected, the originating IP address(es) should be filtered with applicable
technologies such as a web application firewall. Affected organisations should also scan their
internal corporate networks for any malicious activities.
3. Network Segregation or Segmentation
Organisations using web servers are also encouraged to deploy network segregation or
segmentation techniques that limits communications between internet facing services and
internal servers such as those containing sensitive data. This will limit the impact of threat
actors who may successfully gain initial access to vulnerable web applications and reduce the
probability of a data breach.
4. Implement Routine Backups
Organisations should implement routine backups that creates and saves copies of important
files to external and offline storage devices. This will allow for system restoration that
mitigates the impact of a ransomware incident and minimises data loss. Backup media should
be regularly tested to ensure that the backup data can be recovered and restored in time to
help the business recover from data corruption or destruction.

5. Employ Web Application Firewalls
Organisations should also employ web application firewalls to filter malicious network traffic
(e.g. SQLi) and “harden” their system configurations (e.g. for web server and firewalls) by
making appropriate changes to settings and not rely on default settings.
6. Seek External Assistance
Organisations may also wish to hire a professional firm to routinely perform web application
penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify vulnerabilities that may enable
threat actors to gain initial access to their network. Organisations should also seek
professional assistance from cybersecurity service providers for incident response and
remediation if a cybersecurity incident is confirmed.
Should you pay the ransom?
In the event that your organisation’s systems are compromised, we do not recommend paying
the ransom and advise you to report the incident to the authorities. Paying the ransom does
not guarantee that the data will be decrypted or that your data will not be published by threat
actors. It also encourages the threat actors to continue their criminal activities and target
more victims. Threat actors may also see your organisation as a soft target and may strike
again in the future.
