Introduction
In February 2021, a multinational law enforcement task-force arrested several Ukrainian
men for supporting a long-standing ransomware gang known as Twisted Spider. The
gang, first seen in May 2019, is behind high-dollar enterprise ransomware attacks.
Unfortunately, the arrests had little impact, and several weeks later, in March 2021,
Twisted Spider operations continued. Twisted Spider often makes headlines, but it’s not
only due to their attacks. In June 2020, the gang issued a press release, claiming they
joined forces with several other well-known ransomware attackers to create a criminal
cartel. If this is true, this collaborative partnership, sharing resources and revenue, would
pose a far greater threat to the community than attacks from smaller individual gangs by
themselves.
Analyst1 produced this report to address whether or not the Cartel actually exists, as
well as to help analysts better understand and defend against advanced ransomware
attackers. We conduct research and analysis to address the following goals:
• Research and provide an analytical assessment to determine if the Cartel is real or a
fabrication created to distract law enforcement and researchers.
• Profile and assess each gang within the Cartel and determine their relationships with
one another.
• Identify the steps behind how each attacker breaches and extorts their victims.
Understanding the attacker’s behavior and tactics will assist in formulating better
defensive and mitigation processes.

Key Findings
Analyst1 spent time digging through criminal marketplaces where Cartel gangs have
a presence to research and analyze the criminal entities within the alleged Cartel. We
explored the malware and tools the groups use, tracked their bitcoin transactions, and
studied relevant reports from other researchers in the field alongside select media
outlets.
Our research identified several key findings:
1. Analyst1 observed Cartel affiliated gangs distributing/posting victim data across
leak websites belonging to other gangs within the Cartel. In other words, one gang

4

breached and stole data from a victim and passed it to another gang to post publicly
and negotiate with the victim.
2. Analyst1 observed multiple gangs within the Cartel coordinating via Cartel leak
websites, including sharing tactics, command and control infrastructure, and sharing/
posting victim data.
3. Attackers are moving towards automating their attacks. Multiple gangs have added
automated capabilities into their ransom payloads, allowing them to spread and infect
their victims without human interaction.
4. Ransom demands continue to increase. Collectively, gangs in the Cartel generated
hundreds of millions of dollars from ransomware and data extortion operations.
5. Several Cartel gangs offer Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), hiring hackers to
execute attacks while providing them with malware, infrastructure, and ransom
negotiation services.
6. Attackers are becoming bolder ­— they are now conducting PR interviews with
reporters, issuing press releases, and leveraging social media ads and call centers to
harass and pressure victims into paying.
7. Attackers are reinvesting profits made from ransom operations to advance both
tactics and malware to increase their success and revenue. Malware is updated
regularly, adding new sophisticated features.
8. One gang, Wizard Spider, developed unique malware geared towards espionage.
Analyst1 could not validate how Wizard Spider uses it in attacks. It’s existence
alone is troubling. We found no other gang in the Cartel that uses or develops
espionage malware.
We present other detailed findings and assess the overall Cartel theory in the conclusion
of this report.

Cartel Overview
Four ransomware gangs currently exist within the Cartel: Twisted Spider, Viking Spider,
Wizard Spider, and the Lockbit Gang as seen in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1: Cartel breakdown

Note: The SunCrypt gang is no longer active, but they previously claimed allegiance to the Cartel
and have since retired.
The gangs who make up the Cartel originate from eastern Europe and primarily speak
Russian, based on posts made to underground criminal forums. Interestingly, all of the
gangs build checks and balances into their ransomware to ensure that the payload does
not execute on Russian victims. Here, the malware checks if the system language matches
a dialect spoken in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which formerly made
up the Soviet Union. Advanced attackers will often even purposely place false flags into
their operations to lead investigators astray. However, the Cartel gangs do little to hide
the fact they speak Russian, and they go out of their way not to target victims within
affiliated Russian territories.

Timeline
The Cartel emerged in May 2020; however, Twisted Spider began ransomware operations
almost a year earlier, in August 2019. The group developed ransomware named Maze
to use in its attacks. Twisted Spider is one of the first ransomware gangs to incorporate
victim data theft and exposure to pressure victims to pay. Other ransomware gangs soon
adopted the tactic, which is now widely used in big game hunting attacks. Several soonto-be cartel affiliated organizations emerged prior to or during the year between Twisted
Spider’s appearance and the Cartel’s formation. Figure 2 is a timeline of significant events
leading to the Cartel’s establishment.

Twisted Spider
During our research into Twisted Spider operations, Analyst1 identified the following key
findings associated with the Twisted Spider gang:
• Twisted Spider conducted separate operations using Maze ransomware from May
2019 – November 2020, and they began transitioning to Egregor ransomware
from September 2020 to present-day. Each campaign utilized its own malware and
infrastructure, primarily separate from one another.
• Twisted Spider created online personas for each campaign, one using Maze and the
other Egregor ransomware. The operators who make up the gang use these personas
to talk to both the media and security researchers. During media interviews, they
discuss their operations and relationships with other ransomware gangs.
• Since its inception, the group has utilized Egregor and Maze ransomware to extort
at least $75 million from private sector companies, local governments, and hospitals.
We believe this figure to be much more significant, but we can only assess the publicly
acknowledged ransom payments. Many victims never publicly report when they pay
a ransom.
• Twisted Spider uses a key (string/password) required for the Egregor payload to
execute; this makes analysis difficult.
• The gang uses the open-source tool RClone in conjunction with public infrastructure
(FTP servers, Dropbox, etc.) to copy and exfiltrate victim data.
• The gang claims to have created a cartel with other well-known ransomware gangs.
However, they would later attempt to rescind this claim upon retiring their Maze
operations and commencing the attacks using the Egregor payload. However, the
evidence we discuss in the Cartel Assessment section of this report supports the
theory that Twisted Spider and other gangs do work together. Both their retirement
and backtracking on the Cartel affiliation after months of promoting it was likely an
attempt to throw off researchers and law enforcement.

Twisted Spider Details
Most criminals try to avoid drawing attention to themselves and their unlawful activities
— but not Twisted Spider. The gang talks to the media, provide quotes for articles, and is
willing to respond to security researchers. They even have a “Press” section on their data

9

leak website, which they leverage to issue “Press Releases”. On more than one occasion,
the gang communicated with the cybersecurity media organization Bleeping Computer.1,2
The first interaction took place after Twisted Spider attacked Canon, U.S.A., stealing and
encrypting their data. The attack resulted in a double extortion attempt:
• Extortion attempt #1: The gang held Canon’s data hostage through ransomware
encryption. Only Twisted Spider had the decryption key necessary to restore the data
to a usable state. If Canon did not pay the Ransom, the data would remain encrypted.
• Extortion #2: Before executing the ransomware, Twisted Spider made a copy of
Canon’s data, including internal communications and other information not intended
for public release.
To pressure Canon into paying the ransom, Twisted Spider threatened to release their
data publicly. Afterward, Bleeping Computer reached out to Twisted Spider. Surprisingly
enough, Twisted Spider responded to their questions. Bleeping Computer published
quotes from the conversation in an article about ransomware attacks.3 Similar interactions
between the publication and Twisted Spider have continued, until the group transitioned
to Egregor-based operations in the fall of 2020. Using the new ransom payload, the
attacker also obtained new infrastructure for their data leak site and command and
control operations. Since then, interview responses have ceased, and the new leak site did
not include a “Press” page. This could have been due to the impending law enforcement
investigation that led to arrests several months after Egregor operations began. In this
moment, Twisted Spider may have realized that they should not be talking to reporters,
and that they needed to operate with more discretion.
When Twisted Spider developed Egregor, they built several upgraded capabilities into
Egregor’s design. For example, the Egregor payload included an option requiring a
password to execute the ransomware, unlike in Maze. The password feature provides its
developer with an additional level of control. Without the correct password, the payload
is rendered useless and will not run. This makes it extremely difficult to analyze and
prevents its use by anyone other than Twisted Spider or their affiliates.
While researching Twisted Spider activity, Analyst1 attempted to determine how
much revenue the group made through extortion. Unfortunately, while Twisted Spider
frequently posts victims’ names, they do not post the ransom amount companies pay.
However, according to Coveware — a ransomware mediation company — Twisted Spider
demanded an average ransom of $693,333 in their operations.4 During at least one
extortion attempt, they attempted to extort 2 million dollars from Allied Universal.5 If we

10

use the average amount ($693k) and multiply that by the number of victims previously
listed on their data leak sites, the group brought in over 75 million dollars. Through our
research, Analyst1 found Twisted Spider ransom demands ranging from hundreds of
thousands to several million per incident, which corresponds with the average ransom
amount Coveware published. You may wonder why a company would pay such a large
ransom, but oftentimes the cost of rebuilding after a ransom attack far outweighs the
ransom itself. For example, when Twisted Spider attacked Cognizant — an I.T. services
company — it cost 50 to 70 million dollars for them to rebuild their systems and restore
the affected data.6 While we never suggest paying an attacker, this example explains why
some companies do still choose to pay.

Attack Chain
Figure 3 details the attack chain Twisted Spider uses to breach and extort victims.

Figure 3: Twisted Spider Attack Chain

11

1. Initial infection vector varies:
a. A phishing email delivers a malicious macro-enabled office document that
drops commodity malware like IcedID, Qbot, or Ursnif.
b. In other instances, the attacker uses Brute force tactics to exploit RDP on
vulnerable or misconfigured internet-facing devices.
c. The attacker also gains access by exploiting unpatched, vulnerable VPN
software.
2. PowerShell commands are issued to download and compile CobaltStrike.
3. CobaltStrike downloads and installs Mimikatz to collect credentials and gain
administrative privileges.
4. In some instances, the hacktool SystemBC manages and executes the rest of
the attack. Once installed, the attacker uses the SystemBC control panel
to create scheduled tasks. The tasks issue scripts designed to identify and
collect administrative credentials necessary for privilege escalation. SystemBC
also provides proxy capabilities, encrypting the traffic between the victim
environment and the Command and Control (C&C) server.
A. In situations where the attacker used SystemBC credential theft scripts,
they did not use Mimikatz.
5. Next, RClone is downloaded and used to copy victim data, and it is then
exfiltrated using attacker-provided scripts.7 The scripts rely on FTP, WebDAV, or
Dropbox to facilitate the exfiltration, which eventually ends up in attackercontrolled infrastructure.
6. Rclone is an open-source command-line tool that manages and syncs local files
(data) to a remote site. It is normally associated with syncing cloud data, but
the user can still configure any destination, which makes it useful for copying
victim data.
7. The attacker uses Sharphound or AdFind to enumerate and identify vulnerable
components or misconfigurations of Active Directory.8
A. Sharphound is a tool that profiles Active Directory. It can discover
and gather detailed information about group policies, domains, users,
computers, and more.
B. Adfind is an open-source tool which queries and interacts with Active
Directory.
8. Using their new administrative privileges alongside the information they’ve
learned about the victim’s Active Directory domain, the attacker uses a Group
Policy Object to disable Windows Defender.
9. A batch file downloaded via CobaltStrike or SystemBC identifies and disables
various system and security services.
10. The script also issues a vssadmin command to delete shadow copies, thereby
preventing the victim from using recovery features to restore data.
11. The attacker distributes the Egregor payload throughout the environment.

12

12. In some attacks, Twisted Spider uses BitsAdmin to distribute the payload.9
13. BitsAdmin is a Microsoft command-line tool that manages Windows Background
Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS). The service acts at the system level to
transfer data asynchronously. The attacker uses BitsAdmin to create jobs that
transfer and deliver the ransom payload via the BITS (service) to systems
throughout the environment.10
14. Once the attacker disperses the payload across all systems, the payload
executes, encrypts data, and distributes the ransom note.
15. In some attacks, the ransom note prints repeatedly from all printers within the
environment. In at least one attack, it printed tiny ransom notes onto receipt
tape from Point of Sale (PoS) systems.11

Twisted Spider has encrypted victim data since its inception, but they did not incorporate
data theft into their operations until May 2020. At the time, Twisted Spider was one of
the few groups who used the double extortion tactic. Not only did Twisted Spider steal
the data, but they also established their dedicated leak site (DLS) to “name and shame”
the victim. Figure 4 below is a screenshot of posts Twisted Spider made on their website
naming their victims and releasing stolen data.

Figure 4: Egregor (Twisted Spider) ransomware hall of shame (data leak site).

So far, the attacker is professional even during ransom negotiations in which they directly
communicate with the victims. However, perhaps their calm and professional candor is
because things have gone their way up to this point. Despite Twisted Spider’s attempt to
pressure the targeted organizations, not all victims paid. When initial victims did not pay,
Twisted Spider calls the victim names in an online tantrum and makes further threats
— much like a child who does not get their way. Figure 5 is an example of Twisted Spider
issuing a press release insulting the victim.
13

Figure 5: Hole of the month press release!

Clearly, the rationale behind nominating a victim for “hole of the month” was to push
for a victim to pay the ransom. Then, after being called “hole of the month”, the hurtful
name-calling intensifies. Twisted Spider then deals the death blow and designates the
victim as “clown of the month”. For an organized attacker who places time and care into
compromising the victim in the first place, it seems odd to handle post-operation tactics
and negotiations so childishly. Despite the odd turn of events after the ransom attack,
Twisted Spider is still one of the most notorious and dangerous ransomware gangs
active today.

Sekhmet Ties
Like its predecessor, Maze, Egregor ransomware shares source code with older
ransomware known as Sekhmet. In addition to this, all three variants use the Cha Cha
stream cipher and the RSA 2048 encryption algorithm to encrypt victim files. Furthermore,
each variant also has similar ransom notes. The developer likely created the original note
that remained present across all three as a template — not due to collaboration between
the gangs.
However, even without the ransom note connection, the ransomware’s shared code and
encryption mechanism is a strong technical tie.
14

While it is unclear if Twisted Spider directly associates with the criminals behind the
Sekhmet ransomware attacks, it is clear that they must have access to its source code in
order to develop both Maze and Egregor malware variants. Furthermore, attacks involving
all three variants also share several tactics. Here, both gangs conduct data extortion in
addition to data encryption alongside hosting their websites to name and shame victims.
However, these tactics were observed and publicly reported in ransomware attacks
beginning in mid-2020. Since then, many enterprise ransomware attackers have adapted
these tactics, making them too common to use as evidence for attribution purposes. As
of March 2021, attacks involving Maze, Egregor and Sekhmet ransomware are ongoing.
Analyst1 tracks the gangs behind the ransomware operation as two separate groups.
Additionally, there is no evidence supporting the gang behind Sekhmet has an affiliation
with the Cartel.

Viking Spider

16

Viking Spider
Viking Spider first began ransom operations in December 2019, and they use ransomware
known as Ragnar Locker to compromise and extort organizations.12 Below are key findings
identified while researching Viking Spider activity.
• Viking Spider is the first ransomware attacker to install their own virtual machine
(VM) into victim environments. They use this VM to evade detection, and they also
use it as a launch point to execute the attack.
• The gang is the first to use Facebook ads to pressure victims into paying the ransom.
• Viking Spider outsources call centers in India to contact victims asking them to pay
the ransom or risk data exposure.
• Viking Spider uses Managed Service Provider (MSP) software to deliver malware and
hacktools as well as provide remote access into victim environments.
• Viking Spider is one of the few gangs who conduct DDoS attacks alongside ransom
attacks to pressure victims to pay. Another Cartel gang first used this tactic, but Viking
Spider quickly adopted it for their uses as well.
• Viking Spider uses social media such as Twitter to shame non-paying victims publicly.

Viking Spider Details
Viking Spider is the most innovative gang within the ransom Cartel. For instance, the
group was the first to use remote MSP software — such as ConnctWise and Kaseya —
to gain remote access into target environments.13 The legitimate use of the tool allows
for the MSP to manage their client’s environment. During this time, the MSP can take
inventory of endpoint systems, upload and download files, remotely access systems, and
even more. Here, Viking Spider leveraged its capabilities to deliver malware and tools
into the victim environment.
Of course, Viking Spider introduced more novel tactics than simply the use of MSP
remote management software. They also used the management software to download
a Microsoft installer (MSI) instance of Oracle VirtualBox, a Windows XP virtual machine
(VM), and the Ragnar Locker payload.14 Once up and running, Viking Spider manages
the attack from within the VM. No endpoint or antivirus protection runs on the virtual
machine; this allows the attacker to hide their malware and hacktools. The attacker uses
the Windows XP operating system, given that it does not utilize Windows Defender
17

or other security resources included in current Windows operating systems. Now, the
attacker has a hidden enclave within the target’s infrastructure wherein they can safely
manage and execute the rest of the attack. We detail the attacker’s step-by-step process
in the Viking Spider Attack Chain later in this report.
Viking Spider’s creativity did not stop here though. Upon completing the ransom and
data theft component of the attack, Viking Spider then purchased Facebook ads in order
to publicize the breach and pressure victims into paying.15 The gang hijacked legitimate
Facebook accounts to make the purchase, ensuring that neither Facebook nor law
enforcement could trace the ads back to the gang. The ads made it clear that Viking
Spider would release or sell their sensitive data to other criminals if the victim did not pay.
The ads had two effects: targeting victims and pressuring them further. First, Facebook
ads can be marketed to a specific demographic, helping the attacker ensure the correct
target audience viewed the ad. This guaranteed the media and general public would
be aware that the company and their data were at risk of public exposure. Second, it
encouraged secondary victims to pressure the compromised organization to pay the
ransom. Secondary victims are the clients of the breached company whose data is
now in Viking Spider’s control. According to Brian Krebs, a security blogger, the group
even outsourced the task of threatening victims to an Indian call center on at least one
occasion.16 Employees at the call center placed calls to victims, encouraging them to pay
or face having their data made public. It is hard to believe any legitimate company would
take on this work, but in November 2020, this exact thing took place.
If this was not enough, Viking Spider used Twitter to further name and shame victims.
Previously, no ransomware attacker used Facebook ads — let alone hire a call center — to
harass and pressure victims into paying. Eventually, Facebook shut the ads down, forcing
the gang to use their DLS website to shame and pressure victims.
Viking Spider recently began incorporating distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
into their operations. The SunCrypt Gang — also a part of the Cartel — was the first to
implement the tactic which both Viking Spider and Twisted Spider adapted. Viking Spider
even updated their “Rules” page, stating DDoS attacks will cease as long as the victim
pays the ransom. Here, they spin this as a support effort to help breached companies
discover and mediate the very same flaws in which Viking Spider used to compromise
them in the first place.

Attack Chain
Figure 7 above displays the attack chain that Viking Spider used to compromise its targets.
1. The attacker sends a phishing email to deliver a malicious macro-enabled office
document.
a. Viking Spider uses brute force tactics to exploit vulnerable or
misconfigured internet-facing devices running the remote desktop protocol
(RDP) leading to initial access.
b. Another initial access tactic Viking Spider used was to exploit vulnerable
remote IT management tools such as ConnectWise and Kaseya to gain access,
deliver malware and steal victim data from the MSP customer’s environment.
2. Using a PowerShell command, Viking Spider downloads and compiles CobaltStrike,
which is compiled in the victim system’s memory. This allows the attacker to
avoid detection.
3. Next, Cobalt Strike downloads Mimikatz. Mimikatz collects/obtains account
credentials and escalates privileges. Here, Viking Spider needs the credentials
to obtain administrative privileges necessary to execute the attack further.
4. Cobalt Strike downloads and runs a batch file which identifies network drives.
5. A Microsoft installer (.msi) downloads and installs within the victim
environment.
6. The MSI installs an Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor and a Windows XP-based virtual
machine, including the ransomware payload.17
7. The virtual machine maps and connects to the network drives identified earlier
in the attack.
8. The attacker copies data from the victim environment and exfiltrates it to
attacker-controlled infrastructure.
9. The attack now continues and operates from the VM within the victim environment.
10. The attacker uses another Batch, dispersed throughout the environment designed
to disable various security and system services.
11. Using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), the attacker deletes the
local shadow copies via the Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), preventing
the victim from restoring data.
12. The Ragnar ransomware payload disperses to systems throughout the environment
and executes.
13. Ransom note appears to the victim for payment.

While analyzing Viking Spider’s data leak site, Analyst1 noticed the gang’s posts onto their
“Wall of Shame” increased significantly in December 2020 and decreased in January and
February 2021, as seen in Figure 8:

20

Figure 8: Wall of shame posts by month (Oct 2020 – Feb 2021)

Of course, this could simply indicate Viking Spider is having success, and that victims are
paying the ransom without elevating the need for “shaming” them. Keep in mind the gang
claims to only “name and shame” victims who do not respond or pay within the allotted
time given after ransom execution. However, it could also indicate a decrease in attacks
for a re-tooling period, similar to how Twisted Spider attacks using the Maze payload
decreased as they prepared to introduce the Egregor payload into their attack flow.
A third scenario, it is also possible that Viking Spider could be supporting other Cartel
operations, in which their actual attack volume would remain consistent. Regardless,
there is no reason to believe Viking Spider is going away anytime soon.

Wizard Spider

22

Wizard Spider
Wizard Spider is the most experienced attacker. The gang began ransom operations in
August 2018, and they connected to other criminal operations as early as 2016. Analyst1
identified the below key findings during our research into Wizard Spider:
• Wizard Spider has conducted ransom operations previously, using Gogalocker and
MegaCortex ransomware variants, both of which are now retired. They currently
perform attacks with Ryuk and Conti Ransomware.
• The gang works in multiple teams, conducting simultaneous operations with different
ransom payloads. Additionally, they have more malware and hacktools than any other
gang associated with the Cartel.
• Wizard Spider developed unique malware known as Sidoh, which was geared towards
espionage. Analyst1 could not validate how Wizard Spider uses Sidoh in attacks;
however, its existence alone is troubling. We found no other gang in the Cartel that
uses or develops espionage malware.
• Conti Ransomware uses 32 CPU threads at once to defeat defenses and encrypt data
much faster than any other variant.
• As of February 2021, Ryuk Ransomware includes a new “wake-on-LAN” capability,
which allows it to automatically discover and spread to victim systems in the target
environment.

Wizard Spider Details
Wizard Spider uses more malware than any other gang associated with the Cartel. Figure
9 displays the malware used by the gang since their inception.

23

Figure 9: Wizard Spider malware

Trickbot
In the early activity, criminals conducted financial attacks using spam campaigns to
deliver Trickbot, which was then purposed as banking malware. Wizard Spider has only
taken responsibility for its ransomware attacks, making it unclear if they were the original
gang behind the banking malware operations or if they acquired access to Trickbot after
the fact. Regardless, Trickbot is one of Wizard Spider’s go to resources used in Ransom
operations.
One of the advantages Trickbot provides comes from its distribution method. For years,
Trickbot spread through high volume mass “spray and pray” spam campaigns, making it
extremely prevalent and infecting many systems globally. In 2018, Wizard Spider had no
interest in banking-related attacks, but they realized that they could leverage the access
Trickbot provides as an entry point to launch ransomware operations. With Trickbot’s
prevalence in the wild, Wizard Spider did not need to spend time and resources on the
initial compromise. Instead, they could cherry-pick victims already infected with Trickbot.

Ransomware Payloads
Using Trickbot’s access into victim environments, Wizard Spider first began conducting
ransom operations with Ryuk ransomware. Ryuk originates from Hermes ransomware
and shares code with both GogaLocker and MegaCortex ransomware families.
Additionally, Ryuk, GogaLocker, and MegaCortex have all shared C&C infrastructure.
Attacks involving all three payloads continued until late 2019 and into early 2020, when

24

Gogalocker and MegaCortex operations ceased. Based on analysis of the attacks and
the ties discussed, Wizard Spider is behind attacks involving each of the ransomware
variants, and they are one of the few gangs that conduct attacks using more than one
ransom payload concurrently.
Then in August 2020, Wizard Spider joined the Ransom Cartel. Beyond their experience
alone, Wizard Spider has more tools, malware, and sophisticated capabilities than any
other Cartel gangs. For example, Conti ransomware uses 32 CPU threads to defeat
defenses and encrypt victim data faster than any other variant to date. It also has other
unique capabilities, and it can even selectively encrypt files. For instance, it can identify
data stored locally vs shared over a network.
This allows Wizard Spider to focus on network Wizard Spider has more tools,
malware, and sophisticated
shares, which typically hold valuable data while
providing the attacker the option to leave noncapabilities than any
essential data on local systems alone. Focusing
other Cartel gangs.
on “high value data” instead of “all data” increases
operational efficiency and decreases encryption time. Another interesting feature Conti
ransomware has is that it utilizes the Windows restart manager, thereby allowing Conti
to open and close programs to encrypt their data. There have been several variants of
Conti ransomware since its introduction, each adding features and capabilities.
Wizard Spider developers worked on more than Conti ransomware alone, though. In
Feb 2021, the gang upgraded their Ryuk variant by adding a self-spreading, worm-like
capability to the payload. Wizard Spider used a legitimate “wake-on-LAN” technology to
identify and infect other hosts on the network with the Ryuk payload. The feature further
allowed the attacker to power-on offline systems connected to the victim network. This
ensured Wizard Spider could access all victim systems, thereby maximizing ransom
encryption throughout the environment.
When Wizard Spider first began using Conti ransomware, Ryuk infections declined. Due
to this, it looked as though Wizard Spider might be transitioning away from Ryuk. However,
as discussed, gangs often make a public statement when they retire an operation, such as
when Twisted Spider announced they intended to retire Maze operations. Several other
known ransomware gangs outside the Cartel have done the same when transitioning
and retooling their malware and infrastructure. Again, attackers likely do this as a ploy
to throw off law enforcement and researchers. If the gang retires, they may believe we
would not continue to investigate. Fortunately for the good guys, it usually does not take
long to connect the dots when a new operation begins.

25

As time passed though, Wizard Spider made no announcement, and Ryuk operations
continued at a diminished rate. The new Conti operation explains the decrease in Ryuk
activity, but the recent payload update is evidence that Ryuk operations are not going
away any time soon. In October 2020, Wizard Spider stopped using Trickbot in their
attacks. This is likely due to multiple take-down attempts from Microsoft and the U.S.
government. Unfortunately, the take-down attempts did not disrupt attacks for long, and
Trickbot activity still continues. Regardless, at the time of this report Trickbot has not
been seen used in conjunction with new Wizard Spider ransomware attacks.
Further evidence of Wizard Spider conducting concurrent operations involving both
Conti and Ryuk payloads surfaced in Jan 2021 . According to a report produced by
the cyber security company ClearSky, a Bitcoin wallet used by Wizard Spider received
payments from other wallets used in victim extortion attacks involving both Conti and
Ryuk ransomware attacks.18
• Address #1: 1NhNuPogvydJWfTGVp41Rgghqw8MNMjTh3
• Address #2: bc1qtaqrv6eeh83vk2hz9myns9lysrzmm4j4366mmw
• Address #3: bc1qff0xgtxm6ansnd7dpt9ptc5n0deh3zpw5f9s58
The wallets made it easy to validate ClearSky’s findings and provides us with evidence
that Wizard Spider is behind both operations.

The Bazar Backdoor
Like Trickbot, attackers use phishing emails to spread the Bazar backdoor. However, Bazar
uses the Emercoin — a decentralized DNS resolution service — to provide the malware
with the address to command-and-control infrastructure. The Emercoin service uses
the .bazar domain (website-name.bazar), which no other provider can use. According to
Emercoin’s website, due to the design being based on a decentralized model and built on
block chain technology, the infrastructure cannot be revoked or suspended, thus making
it attractive to cybercriminals:

“Because of Emercoin’s secure and distributed blockchain the domain name records
are completely decentralized and uncensorable and cannot be altered, revoked
or suspended by any authority. Only a record’s owner can modify or transfer it to
another owner, and a record’s owner is determined by whoever controls the private
key to the associated payment address.”
— Emercoin19

26

The Anchor Backdoor
Another resource in Wizard Spider’s toolbox is the Anchor backdoor. Wizard Spider uses
Anchor to compromise Point of Sale (PoS) systems and steal related financial data such as
credit card information. Unlike some of the other malware discussed, Anchor is second
stage malware, which attackers introduce after the initial compromise of environments
believed to have PoS data. Furthermore, it does not appear in each attack. Upon
collecting the data, Anchor obfuscation techniques then combine with DNS tunneling to
exfiltrate data.

Sidoh Malware
One of the least-used but most interesting binaries in Wizard Spider’s arsenal is Sidoh
malware.20 According to CrowdStrike, Sidoh is not designed for financial gain, unlike the
other resources discussed thus far. Instead, its developer designed Sidoh for information
theft. Interestingly, CrowdStrike identified strings the tool uses to search for data with
the terms “military, secret, clandestine, and government”. This type of tool is typically
associated with nation-state attacks geared towards espionage. Naturally, this raises
many questions about why Wizard Spider uses it. As an analyst, you have to ask yourself:
why would a ransomware gang need espionage malware? Analyst1 intends to find out
more in upcoming research, but based on Wizard Spider’s history of attacks, it does not
add up. Additionally, based on initial analysis, Sidoh shares code with Ryuk ransomware.
Here, this further supports the theory that Wizard Spider created it.

Attack Chain
Analyst1 believes that the Wizard Spider gang is broken up into several teams. Each of
these teams facilitates its ransom operation involving Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Based
on this, we believe the Wizard Spider gang is larger than other ransomware attackers,
given that other attackers only execute one ransom operation at a time. Utilizing multiple
teams would also explain why Wizard Spider uses several attack chains. While we
document the two most recently observed with Ryuk and Conti payloads, Wizard Spider
has at least five different attack chains in their playbook.

27

Ryuk Ransomware Attack Chain

Figure 10: Wizard Spider attack chain using Ryuk Ransomware
1. Wizard Spider utilizes a spear phishing email with a malicious URL to gain
initial entry into victim environments.
2. The lure doc executes PowerShell commands on the victim system.
a. The PowerShell command downloads Emotet onto the victim system.
b. In some instances, compromised RDP servers provide the initial access into
the environment, and PowerShell runs afterward to download CobaltStrike.
3. Emotet then conducts system profiling (recon) and collects information such
as computer & usernames, operating system version, network, and other active
directory domain information. All of this is sent to the attacker’s C&C server.
4. Next, Emotet downloads and drops Trickbot – which runs in memory – and injects
into legitimate processes to avoid detection.
5. Trickbot then creates a scheduled task to run, ensuring persistence.

28

6. The attacker obtains account credentials through Trickbot’s credential theft
module, or alternatively, through the use of Mimikatz to acquire domain admin
credentials.
7. In some instances, the attacker uses the domain controllers via their admin
access to spread ransomware across the network.
8. Trickbot then collects email associated files/messages and sends them back to
the C&C.
9. Trickbot or CobaltStrike downloads batch files.
a. The batch files purposed to identify and disable attacker-selected services.
b. The attacker deletes the local shadow copies via the Windows Volume Shadow
Copy Service (VSS), preventing the victim from restoring data.
10. Trickbot downloads the Ryuk payload.
11. The Ryuk ransomware payload uses a wake-on-LAN capability to identify other
hosts, wake offline systems, and deliver the ransomware to all systems.
12. Finally, by executing the ransom payload, the victim’s data is encrypted
throughout the environment.
13. The ransom note appears on systems across the victim’s environment.

Conti Ransomware Attack Chain
1. Wizard Spider sends a phishing email targeting the soon-to-be victim.
2. Unlike phishing attempts from other gangs in the Cartel, Wizard Spider often
uses legitimate Google docs in the form of a URL present in the email body.
a. The phishing email encourages the user to click the URL, which then
downloads a malicious document. This delivers the Bazar backdoor onto the
victim system.
3. Using Bazar malware’s capabilities, Wizard Spider downloads CobaltStrike and
several other hacktools into the environment.
4. Bazar creates a scheduled task to run, thus ensuring its persistence.
5. Cobalt Strike downloads and executes Mimikatz in the memory of the victim
system to elude detection.
6. The attacker uses Mimikatz to steal victim credentials.
a. The Bazar malware can also steal credential information from victim
browsers, but it is unclear if Wizard Spider fully relied on this
capability, since Mimikatz also steals credentials.
7. Victim data and Email associated files/messages are collected and sent back
to C&C.
8. Cobalt Strike downloads and runs attacker-provided batch files.
a. Batch files which identify and disable attacker selected services are
distributed throughout the environment and ran on each system.

29

9. The attacker deletes the local shadow copies via the Windows Volume Shadow
Copy Service (VSS), preventing the victim from restoring data.
10. CobaltStrike and PSExec distribute Conti ransomware payload throughout the
environment.
a. In some instances, the attacker uses the domain controllers via their admin
access to spread ransomware across the network.
11. After the ransomware executes, the ransom note presented to the victim.

While specific to their operations involving Conti ransomware, Wizard Spider uses data
leak websites similar to other Cartel gangs to “name and shame” and leak victim data.

30

Figure 12: Wizard Spider data leak site, continews[.]best.

Of note, at the time of this report, we could not identify a data leak site that attackers
have used in conjunction with Ryuk operations. It is unclear why Wizard Spider uses the
tactic with Conti ransomware but not the Ryuk payload. Also, as a direct result of poor
attribution practices, many security vendors and the media claim that Conti replaces
Ryuk, which based on the evidence present at this time, is simply not correct.

Lockbit Gang

32

Lockbit Gang
The Lockbit Gang first came onto the enterprise ransomware scene in September 2020.
Much like the other gangs discussed so far, Lockbit brings its own unique tactics to the
ransomware game. Analyst1 found the following key findings while researching the
Lockbit Gang:
• The Lockbit Gang was the first to automate attacks, and they remain as the most
efficient Cartel attacker.
• Lockbit ransomware uses a self-propagation technique. Upon execution, it issues an
ARP request to identify devices within the environment, and it then connects using
the SMB protocol to spread. Once connected to a live host, it executes a PowerShell
command that connects to attacker C&C infrastructure. At this point, it proceeds to
download the ransom payload (often disguised as an image file).
• At least once, the attacker overwrote the Master Boot Record (MBR), requiring a
password to boot. The Lockbit Gang achieved this through the use of the open-source
tool BCDedit. BCDedit is a command-line tool that can edit the boot configuration in
M.S. Windows operating systems.
• The Lockbit Gang conducts interviews about their attacks with news media.

Lockbit Gang Details
We mentioned the Lockbit Gang is the most efficient ransomware attacker to date. Most
attackers spend days to weeks actively working in a victim’s network before executing
the ransom payload. However, the Lockbit Gang has compromised victims and automates
their attacks, allowing them to move from initial access to ransom execution in just a few
hours. While their attacks are far more efficient, they require the Lockbit Gang to gain
administrative access early in the attack.
One such example of Lockbit’s efficiency comes from Darktrace. Darktrace is a leading
AI cyber defense company, and in a February 2021 they identified a Lockbit attack.
During this attack, the gang moved from initial breach to payload execution within two
hours.21 Fortunately, in this occurrence, Dark Trace’s technology allowed the victim to
mitigate the attack, but this is not always the case. Again, this efficiency is significant, as
it gives defenders far less time to identify when an attacker is present on their network.
In regards to their methodology, the Lockbit Gang uses the ransomware, tools present in
the environment, and a commodity keylogger in their attacks.
33

Figure 13: Lockbit Gang malware overview

The attacker also appears to be learning from mistakes in previous attacks, growing in
sophistication. In early operations, the group used the file transfer protocol (FTP) to
exfiltrate victim data. The problem with this tactic is that FTP transmits data in clear
text. Moving large amounts of data from the victim environment could very easily draw
attention to the attacker. In recent attacks however, the Lockbit Gang has changed tactics
and switched to using an IPSEC tunnel to create an encrypted channel to exfiltrate victim
data, eluding detection.
The operational efficiency seen across attacks is not an afterthought with the Lockbit
gang, but a primary focus. The streamlined capabilities seen in attacks began in the
development phase of Lockbit ransomware. For example, its developer devised many
features into its code design, automating portions of the attack chain using a worm-like
capability to spread throughout the environment. Specifically, it leverages the Server
Message Protocol (SMB) to identify other hosts and network shares within the target
environment. Then, using batch files, Lockbit issues PowerShell commands from each
discovered host, having them download, execute, and infect themselves with Lockbit’s
ransom payload. Of course, there is more to the attack, which we discuss next in the
Lockbit Attack Chain.

Attack Chain
1. The attacker uses brute force techniques to exploit un-patched vulnerable VPN
software.
a. In the attack observed, the victim’s VPN software flaw resulted in the
attacker gaining access to a domain admin account.
2. Unlike all other attacks discussed, Lockbit attacks are automated. After
gaining initial access, the malware identifies a single host and delivers the
ransomware payload.
3. Using their administrative access, security services are disabled on the
infected host, such as Windows Defender and the system firewall.
4. A keylogger/screen capture tool (HAKOPS Keylogger) is also dropped on the
infected system that captures the victim’s keystrokes, takes screenshots, and

34

transmits data once per day to an FTP server located in Ukraine.
5. The malware instructs the victim system to delete local shadow copies via the
Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSSADMIN) to prevent data restoration.
6. Next, the ransomware instructs the victim system to transmit a broadcast
ARP request to all hosts in order to identify other systems present in the
environment.
7. Now that the network is enumerated and systems and the servers have been
identified, the malware issues a PowerShell command instructing each of the
hosts to establish a connection with attacker-controlled infrastructure and
download an image (.PNG file) that drops a malicious PE.
8. In other occurrences, the attacker downloads additional hacktools in order to
lock the user out of their desktop. This prevents the user from interfering
with the ransom encryption process once initiated.
9. Upon execution, the downloaded binary installs Lockbit ransomware onto each
system identified in the previous discovery step.
10. Finally, the ransomware encrypts the victim’s files and delivers the ransom
note.
11. In one at least one attack, MBR is also encrypted on victim systems.

Figure 14: Lockbit attack chain

35

Attack Chain Two

Figure 15: Lockbit Attack Chain two (Derived from research first published by Sophos Security)22
1. The specifics of the initial compromise with this particular attack chain
are unknown, but Lockbit likely uses other common vectors such as phishing
emails that deliver malicious lure docs. Interestingly, according to Sophos,
the victims they observed had no public (Internet) facing systems, but many of
their internal systems had poor security hygiene.
a. Similar to the first Lockbit attack chain discussed, Lockbit manages and
initiates the attack from one central victim within the target environment.
2. Upon initial access, a PowerShell command downloads a Google Doc spreadsheet
with Base64 encoded commands in the sheet’s cells. This is also evidence that a
phishing email is likely the initial infection vector.
3. The victim systems execute the command found within one of the spreadsheet
cells, instructing the system to download additional scripts.

36

4. The next script instructs the victim to connect to Lockbit’s C&C server and
download yet another script. This script then copies and renames PowerShell.exe
and Microsoft Scripting Host, MSHTA.exe.
5. Next, using the resources copied in the previous step, the attacker instructs
the system to create a task which uses Visual Basic to “invoke” a secondary
backdoor to ensure persistence.
a. Lockbit also uses a .LNK file, which is placed into the Windows startup
directory.
b. The .LNK file essentially downloads and compiles another backdoor onto the
victim system at startup.
6. Several other downloaded modules check and disable security services and
applications, delete backup services, and conduct other attack related
functions.
7. The backdoors communicate with Lockbit C&C servers, and depending on the
response, they will create an IPsec tunnel to copy and exfiltrate victim data.
8. Finally, a PowerShell script invokes WMI to download and distribute the Lockbit
payload onto systems throughout the environment.
a. Ransom payload executes, displaying the ransom across the victim systems.

After Lockbit completes the operation’s data theft and encryption phase, the double
extortion stage begins. Like most other gangs in the Cartel, the Lockbit Gang hosts their
own data leak site to name and shame the victim. Additionally, Lockbit adds a secure chat
room on their website for victims to communicate during ransom negotiations. Historically,
ransomware attackers used publicly available and free email accounts like Proton mail — a
legitimate email service based on encryption and secure communications —
­ to negotiate
with victims. By using their own secure chat infrastructure to host negotiations, they
leave no email trail for law enforcement to investigate. Essentially, this removed one more
piece of evidence that could lead back to the individuals behind the gang.

Figure 16: Trial decrypt and chat function on Lockbit’s data leak site.
37

Amusingly, Lockbit presents themselves as a “support” service that, for a fee — AKA the
ransom payment — will help the victim restore their data and even harden their security
posture by disclosing the vulnerabilities discovered in the initial breach. Figure 17 displays
Lockbit’s data leak website.

Figure 17: Lockbit’s data leak and wall of shame website.

Unlike some of the other Cartel gangs discussed, the Lockbit Gang has not resorted to
name-calling in their DLS, and they have remained professional regardless of payment.
Despite these advanced tactics discussed, the Lockbit Gang struggled in early operations
to establish itself amongst its peers before they joined the Cartel. A cybercriminal claiming
to be a Lockbit affiliate — one who supported four months of ransom operations — claimed
problems existed in the attack.23 According to the affiliate, the problems surrounded the
ransomware’s encryption method, and Lockbit Gang could not decrypt victim files. It is
standard operating procedure across most enterprise ransomware attacks to decrypt a
small number of files as proof that the encryption key will work once the victim pays. If
the Lockbit Gang could not decrypt the victim files as proof, it is unlikely a victim would
pay the ransom. Naturally, these problems resulted in a loss of profit. The affiliate did
their part in the attack, and despite that they never got paid for their work. As an affiliate
38

working for a RaaS provider, this is a big issue. Now, the Lockbit leak site provides a file
decryption service, shown in Figure 16. Since the gang built the feature into their website
they likely resolved the file decryption problem.

The SunCrypt
Gang
40

The SunCrypt Gang
The SunCrypt Gang began conducting ransomware attacks in October 2019. Analyst1
researched the attacks and progression of SunCrypt operations up to present day and
found the following key findings:
• SunCrypt is the first gang to introduce DDoS as an extortion tactic used in conjunction
with enterprise ransomware attacks.
• The SunCrypt Gang claimed affiliation with both Twisted Spider and the Cartel.
Twisted Spider disputed both claims in an interview with Bleeping Computer.
• SunCrypt ransomware uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher found in Twisted Spider’s
Maze and Egregor ransomware payloads.
• The SunCrypt gang’s ransomware communicated with two C&C IP addresses that
Twisted Spider used and controlled in their Maze ransomware operations. These
findings are significant, since Twisted Spider disputes the SunCrypt Gang’s Cartel
affiliation claim.
• Operations ceased in October 2020, but transfers from victims’ bitcoin wallets
continued until November 2020.

SunCrypt Details
Much like any good reality TV show, drama ensued between the SunCrypt Gang and
Twisted Spider after the gang publicly claimed affiliation to the Cartel. In late August
2020, Bleeping Computer publicly released the conversation between the two gangs,
wherein each party told their side of the story. Bleeping Computer first reported that
the SunCrypt Gang emailed them directly, detailing their new affiliation with the Ransom
Cartel. Even stranger, six days after the publication, Twisted Spider contacted Bleeping
Computer disputing the claims:

“We do not have any connections with SunCrypt, it is a lie.”
“We do not know why SunCrypt does it, but we believe it is a PR strategy, to send
links to companies in chat that they are working with us as a pressure.”
— Reported by Bleeping Computer24
While Twisted Spider disputed SunCrypt’s claim, their story did not line up with the facts.
Despite claiming that the two groups had no affiliation, SunCrypt and Twisted Spider

41

actually shared C&C infrastructure. Advanced Intel’s Vitali Kremez first identified that
both attackers leveraged IP addresses 91.218.114[.]30 and 91.218.114[.]31 for C&C in
their attacks.25 Further, Maze, Egregor (Twisted Spider),
and SunCrypt (SunCrypt gang) payloads each use the
SunCrypt is the first
Cha Cha stream cipher to encrypt victim data.

ransomware gang
to use DDoS attacks
in conjunction with
ransomware in its
operations

Just after the public dispute with Twisted Spider in
early September, the SunCrypt gang began to deploy
DDoS attacks in conjunction with ransomware in its
operations. As previously mentioned, SunCrypt is the
first ransomware gang to use this tactic, and other
gangs within the Cartel quickly adopted the strategy.
Interestingly, despite claiming no affiliation with SunCrypt, Twisted Spider was the first
to adopt the tactic. If having data encrypted and stolen was not enough, now victims had
to deal with business loss due to their websites and services being unavailable to their
customers. The downed services and unreachable websites may tip off victim clients and
draw attention publicly; this of course places additional pressure on the victim to pay the
ransom quickly.
Strangely, the SunCrypt Gang disappeared shortly after the addition of the DDoS tactic
and their public dispute with Twisted Spider. The gang appears to have abandoned
operations, but oddly, their data leak sites remain up. Coincidentally, Twisted Spider
terminated Maze ransomware operations around the same timeframe. However, in its
closure, Twisted Spider took down their data leak site infrastructure. Let’s examine this
idea a bit further: suppose a gang is closing down operations, or perhaps they are retooling
for the next phase of its criminal activities. In that case, it only makes sense to remove any
trace of their previous attacks and infrastructure. If for no other reason, taking down
the infrastructure would prevent it from later being used as evidence against the gang.
Similarly, this could prevent law enforcement from tracing the infrastructure back to the
attacker. While affiliate hackers claim the SunCrypt Gang retired, the sudden departure
after their dispute with Twisted Spider remains suspicious.
Furthermore, Twisted Spiders and the SunCrypt Gang’s data leak sites have press release
pages to communicate and make announcements. Why did the SunCrypt Gang not use
their press release page to announce their retirement as other attackers have done?
Figure 18 shows the last update to the press section of SunCrypt’s site.

42

Figure 18: SunCrypt Press release webpage on their data leak site

Historically, both groups have reputations for talking to the media. When Twisted Spider
retired Maze operations, they posted a press release to their website announcing their
intention. In addition to not making a press release, the gang never reached out to the
media or used social media to announce retiring operations in any way. Instead, they just
disappeared in their prime. The only information about their retirement comes from Kela
— an Israeli cyberthreat intelligence monitoring firm — who found SunCrypt affiliates (not
the core gang) who commented on an underground forum, explaining that the SunCrypt
program was closing.26
Notwithstanding, the information comes secondhand from criminals and not the
SunCrypt Gang themselves, making it hold little weight. Keep in mind; allegedly, organized
crime runs the Cartel and the gangs within it. Did the gang retire, or did something else
happen to lead to their sudden disappearance? Why did they not make a statement on
their website’s press section, as others have in the past? Why is their infrastructure live
but abandoned? We will likely never know, but there is usually a reason when things don’t
add up.

Attack Chain

Figure 19: SunCrypt Gang attack chain
1. The attacker gains initial access by using multiple vectors. The attacker
sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or brute-forced RDP
connections on victim infrastructure.
2. PowerShell commands issued to download and compile CobaltStrike in the memory
of the infected system.
3. Next, CobaltStrike downloads Mimikatz and uses it to obtain administrative
credentials.
4. The attacker copies and exfiltrates victim data.
5. A batch script is downloaded and dispersed to systems throughout the environment.
6. Scripts run, executing commands to delete shadow copies necessary for data
restoration.
7. Using PSExec, the ransom payload disperses and executes to encrypt victim data
8. The payload distributes the ransom note.
9. After data theft and encryption, the attacker launches a DDoS attack against
the victim’s infrastructure and services, preventing them from conducting
business and pressuring them to pay the ransom.
10. Posts to the the “Wall of Shame” website threaten to leak victim data. The
longer the victim takes to pay, the more data the attacker leaks.

Following the payment transactions from SunCrypt operations provides insight into the
revenue generated from their attacks. One of the victims made two transactions involving
a SunCrypt wallet address. The first was for one bitcoin; this is typically done in attacks
to validate the transaction and wallets before sending larger amounts. In the second
transaction, the victim paid the SunCrypt Gang over 31 bitcoin for a total of ~$350,000
(based on bitcoin currency value at the time the attack took place).

Of note, the attack involving this bitcoin wallet took place in September 2020, several
weeks before SunCrypt ceased operations. However, the money was not moved out of
the account until November 17th, almost two months after the gang disappeared. Yet
another piece of evidence that does not add up.

Cartel Assessment

Cartel Assessment
In November 2020, Twisted Spider — the gang who began the Cartel — announced that
they were shutting down operations. In a further twist, they also claimed the Cartel
never existed! In their last press release, Twisted Spider stated the Cartel was only real
in journalists’ minds. Based on the events detailed throughout this paper and the specific
ties between the Cartel gangs outlined next, Twisted Spider’s claims are untrue.
The initial claim the gang was retiring was misleading. The tactics used in the attacks
overlap in infrastructure, and the technical similarities between Egregor and Maze
ransomware made for strong attribution. Clearly, Twisted Spider was behind both
operations. The second claim stating the Cartel never existed was not as clear-cut.
Twisted Spider, Viking Spider, Wizard Spider, the Lockbit gang, and the SunCrypt gang
claimed they were a ransomware Cartel. Why would all of these criminal gangs speak
out publicly, stating they had joined together? To further assess, Analyst1 looked to the
evidence to make our own assessment.
The first tie we found provided evidence that the groups are working together and sharing
resources to extort victims. Several gangs compromised and stole victim data, which they
passed on to Twisted Spider. Twisted Spider then posted the victim’s data and attempted
to negotiate a ransom on their data leak site. This type of collaboration and sharing would
not occur unless all three criminal elements had a trusted relationship with one another.
Figure 21 below is a visualization of the Ties A and B which we discuss next.

Tie A: Shared Data Leak Sites
In May 2020, Viking Spider compromised MJ Brunner of brunnerworks.com. After the
compromise, Viking Spider posted Brunner’s data to their leak site, ragnerleaks[.]top. A
few weeks later in June 2020, Twisted Spider posted Brunner data on Viking Spider’s
behalf along with threatening messages to their data leak site, mazenews[.]top. Not long
after, a similar situation took place. This time, the Lockbit Gang breached and attempted
to extort a target: the Smith Group. At the time however, the Lockbit Gang did not have
a data leak site. In a continued effort to share Cartel resources, Twisted Spider posted
the stolen data to their site, mazenews[.]top, on behalf of the Lockbit gang. Furthermore,
Twisted Spider referenced both the Cartel and each member gang who originally stole
the data on both occasions. Figure 22 shows the post below.

(Ragnar) and Lockbit gang.27,28

Tie B: Shared Infrastructure
We mentioned previously that the SunCrypt Gang told Bleeping Computer in August
2020 that they joined the Cartel, which Twisted Spider disputed. Yet, beginning in October
2020 in their early operations, Twisted Spider used two IP addresses, 91.218.114[.]30

48

& 31 for command-and-control infrastructure.29,30 Ten months later, the SunCrypt Gang
used the same IP addresses for command-and-control to deliver ransomware in their
attacks. Granted, the tie would be stronger if the IP used in ransom operations took place
during the same time frame. However, Twisted Spider used the 91.218.114.3X range
for attacks over at least six months. The extended use and address range indicates that
this was persistent infrastructure that Twisted Spider frequently used and controlled
themselves. It is unlikely that the SunCrypt Gang would have access to the infrastructure
if they did not have a trusted relationship with Twisted Spider. Table 1 below details the
evidence supporting Tie B.

Other Ties:
Several other circumstantial and technical ties exist as well. These are weaker ties, and
you should not use them for attribution on their own, but they are worth discussing
collectively:
• Maze and Egregor ransomware (Twisted Spider) SunCrypt ransomware (SunCrypt
Gang) use the Cha Cha stream cypher to encrypt data.
• All of the gangs build checks and balances into their ransomware to ensure the payload
does not execute on Russian victims.
• Gangs in the Cartel share and adapt each other’s tactics:
• Double extortion technique (data theft and data encryption)
• DDoS in conjunction with data theft and data encryption
• Use of VM within victim environments to execute attacks and avoid detection
• Use of data leak websites to name and shame victims
• Additionally, each gang discussed has claimed affiliation to the Cartel. Some made
claims to reporters while others posted on leak sites and social media.

Closing
Analyst1 assesses that the Cartel is not an authentic entity, but instead a collective of
criminal gangs who, at times, work together in ransom operations. There needs to be
more than cooperation, resource, and tactic sharing between gangs for their partnership
to qualify as a true Cartel, though. Profit-sharing is the primary element missing in the
coalition of ransomware attackers discussed. Cartels are dangerous due to the large
financial resources that profit-sharing provides.
Analyst1 researched all known bitcoin wallets and their associated transactions associated
with the gangs discussed. We followed the money trail and observed examples of victims
paying a gang and gangs paying their affiliates, but we did not find any evidence that the
gangs share profits with other gangs in the Cartel.
We believe the gangs created the Cartel facade to appear larger, stronger more powerful
to further intimidate victims into paying ransom demands. The illusion and public claims
made about the Cartel achieved the desired effect; however, it also brought global
attention from law enforcement and government entities. We believe this prompted
Twisted Spider to lie about retiring, and this explains why they attempted to retract their
Cartel affiliation. For the same reasons, Twisted Spider stopped communicating publicly,
and they no longer use social media or press releases to voice their demands.
Moving forward, Analyst1 believes these ransomware gangs will continue to work with
one another. The working relationship, however, will likely continue to be done behind
the scenes and not on a public level. Groups will continue to share tactics and resources,
making them far more dangerous than if they were operating independently. Both
ransomware and malware used to gain initial compromise will increase in their levels of
sophistication and capability. Specifically, Analyst1 believes ransomware gangs will focus
development efforts to automate attacks. The new capabilities gangs are introducing
into their ransomware demonstrate that automation is essential. Analyst1 believes this
trend will continue making ransomware operations more efficient and dangerous. As
automation capabilities increase, the use of affiliate hackers will decrease. This means
ransomware gangs do not have to share profits with affiliates, thus increasing the revenue
derived from each attack. With the decrease in the timeframe it takes to execute each
attack, Analyst1 believes the overall volume of attacks will grow, raising the number of
victims extorted.
