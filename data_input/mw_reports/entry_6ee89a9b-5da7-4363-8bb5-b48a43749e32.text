This is the second in a four-part blog series on the NOBELIUM nation-state cyberattack. In
December 2020, Microsoft began sharing details with the world about what became known
as the most sophisticated nation-state cyberattack in history. Microsoft’s four-part video
series “Decoding NOBELIUM” pulls the curtain back on the NOBELUM incident and how
world-class threat hunters from Microsoft and around the industry came together to take on
the most sophisticated nation-state attack in history. In this second post, we’ll explore the
investigation in the second episode of the docuseries.
The threat hunters had but weeks to unravel a global attack that had been planned and
executed by an advanced adversary for over a year. The early days of a cyberattack
investigation can feel like joining a high-stakes chess match after your opponent has already
made a series of moves. You must figure out what your adversary has done while
anticipating their next step, and launching a counterplay—all simultaneously. Instead of on a
chessboard, your clues are found in the code, logs, and responses to your counterattacks. In
the case of the NOBELIUM nation-state attack, this was a highly skilled chess player, but we
came together as a company and as an industry to take on this shared adversary. This all
started when one security company, Mandiant (formerly known as FireEye), spotted an
anomaly in its own environment and shared the evidence with Microsoft for additional
analysis, but this story would eventually involve thousands of defenders across the industry
to uncover the full picture and help protect organizations.

As explained in our first post in this series, How nation-state attackers like NOBELIUM are
changing cybersecurity, nation-state attacks are malicious cyberattacks that originate from a
particular country and are an attempt to further that country’s interests. The nation-state
attack from NOBELIUM, a Russia-sponsored group of hackers, is widely recognized as the
most sophisticated in history. The group gained access to multiple enterprises before their
actions were detected. This second episode of “Decoding NOBELIUM” explores how the
group was detected and how defenders responded in the weeks that followed.

How was NOBELIUM detected?
It was late November 2020 when a security analyst at cybersecurity company Mandiant
detected something unusual in its environment. While reviewing sign-in logs for the previous
day, she noticed an event for a user with a different registered device. Intuition told her
something was off so she called the user to ask if they’d registered a new device. The
answer would set off an unprecedented, industry-wide hunt to catch a cybercriminal. The
user said, “No.”
The security professional alerted her colleagues, including her supervisor, Charles Carmakal,
Mandiant Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. While they didn’t yet know the
identity of the adversary, they would come to realize the importance of this initial detection.
Recognizing that his company needed more collaboration and telemetry to better understand
the nature of the attack, Carmakal quickly turned to Microsoft. It was about 9:00 PM when
Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) Lead Dan Taylor received the call asking
for help. Dan initially thought Carmakal was joking and when he realized it was serious, he
called Microsoft DART Lead Investigator Roberto, who was taking his dog for the last walk of
the day, to ask him if he recognized the anomalous code Mandiant had found. Roberto
confirmed that he had seen this anomaly during a previous nation-state investigation.

How did the defense team come together?
Every second counts when responding to large-scale cyberattacks like this. NOBELIUM had
a year-long advantage on the defenders. A global threat-hunting effort was formed around
the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, which defends Microsoft and its customers from
advanced threat actors around the world. They immediately activated Microsoft’s team of
global security experts, who are on-call for major incidents.
Microsoft Security Analyst Joanne was lacing up her hiking boots on a Saturday when she
received a text from her supervisor to the entire team that read, “We need all hands on deck
for an active incident.” The hike would have to wait as she and her teammates began
studying the available data for indicators of an attack.

As Microsoft continued to partner with Mandiant, it quickly became clear that this attack
extended well beyond one security company. The Microsoft response team grew along with
this knowledge. With every meeting, another 50 to 100 Microsoft threat experts joined in—
everyone came together to help. And the industry-wide collaboration grew as well. “Many
different partners across the industry came together with a common goal,” said Ramin,
Senior Malware Reverse Engineer with the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.
The biggest challenge was the sophisticated tradecraft of the attacker. They practiced
extreme variability. “It became very clear to us that we were dealing with a highly capable,
highly clandestine, and advanced adversary,” said Carmakal. NOBELIUM would never use
the same IP address across organizations—even going so far as to change it every time the
group re-entered the same organization’s network. That meant that traditional markers—
including hashes, file names, and IP addresses—were all brittle indicators and less helpful
for tracking the attacker’s path. Over time, they began identifying subtle markers of malicious
activity.
The team’s relentless investigation led to a breakthrough—they discovered that the unknown
threat actor was stealing credentials and moving through the networks undetected. During
the ongoing investigation, the team uncovered that anomalous activity was happening within
the SolarWinds platform. After decompiling 50,0000 lines of SolarWind’s code, Mandiant and
Microsoft’s reverse engineers identified NOBELIUM malware carefully obfuscated within
layers of code, designed to easily spread undetected to thousands of target organizations.
“When we found that scope, it was a combination of exciting and scary,” said Pete, Senior
Software Engineer of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.
“You got a sense that this attacker could start in hundreds of customer networks, very deep
into them with elevated rights,” said John Lambert, General Manager of the Microsoft Threat
Intelligence Center. “When you realize how many enterprise customers and government
departments use [SolarWinds], you knew that this attacker had achieved a place to have
major impact, across the globe.”
Over weeks, the hunters uncovered a sophisticated, advanced threat with a scale and scope
beyond anything they could have initially guessed. Now, it was time to use that hard-won
knowledge to find and repel the current threat from NOBELIUM and prepare for future
attacks.

NOBELIUM lessons
How did cybersecurity professionals identify NOBELIUM as the threat actor behind the attack
and what can your organization do to detect and respond to nation-state attacks? In the
second episode of our four-part video series “Decoding Nobelium,” security professionals
talk about the investigation that followed the discovery of NOBELIUM’s attack. Watch the
episode for tips on how to protect your organization against cyberattacks.

Microsoft is committed to helping organizations stay protected from cyberattacks, whether
cybercriminal or nation-state. In particular, nation-state adversaries have significant expertise
and resources and will develop new attack patterns to further their geopolitical objectives.
Consistent with our mission to provide security for all, Microsoft will use our leading threat
intelligence and global team of dedicated cybersecurity defenders to help protect our
customers and the world. Just two recent examples of Microsoft’s efforts to combat nationstate attacks include a September 2021 discovery, an investigation of a NOBELIUM malware
referred to as FoggyWeb, and our May 2021 profiling of NOBELIUM’s early-stage toolset
compromising EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage.
