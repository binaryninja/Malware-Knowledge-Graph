EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
With Internet-shattering distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks, troves of records leaked through data breaches, and
a renewed focus by organized cybercrime on business targets,
2016 was a defining year for security. Indeed, in 2016 more than
4 billion records were leaked, more than the combined total
from the two previous years, redefining the meaning of the term
“mega breach.” In one case, a single source leaked more than
1.5 billion records.1

Activity on a system
or network detected
by a security device
or application.

Attack

A security event that
has been identiﬁed by
correlation and
analytics tools as
malicious activity that
is attempting to
collect, disrupt, deny,
degrade or destroy
information system
resources or the
information itself.

Security
incident

An attack or security
event that has been
reviewed by IBM
security analysts and
deemed worthy of
deeper investigation.

Figure 1: Definitions of terms.

Most notably, the average monitored client was found to have
experienced 93 security incidents in 2016, down 48 percent
from the 178 discovered in 2015.

Deﬁnitions of terms

Security
event

In our monitored client environments, IBM® X-Force® saw
that the average client organization experienced more than 54
million security events in 2016—only three percent more events
than 2015. At the same time, client organizations monitored by
X-Force experienced an average 12 percent decrease in attacks
in 2016 compared to 2015 (1,019 attacks in 2016 compared to
1,157 attacks in 2015).

Breach

An incident that
results in the
exﬁltration of data. In
this report, “breach
data” is a sampling of
notable publicly
disclosed incidents,
not monitored
security client
incidents.

Does this reduction in attacks and incidents reflect a safer
security environment in 2016? Perhaps. That would be
wonderful news to report. However, the reduction in attacks
could mean attackers are relying more and more on proven
attacks, thus requiring fewer attempts. Additionally, the
combination of massive record leaks and a record year
of vulnerability disclosures also paints a different picture.
Regardless of the total number of attempted attacks or
incidents, it takes only one successful compromise for an
organization to end up as front page news and facing millions
of dollars in data breach costs.2

METHODOLOGY
To better understand the security threat landscape, X-Force
uses both data from monitored security clients and data
derived from non-customer assets such as spam sensors and
honeynets. X-Force runs spam traps around the world and
monitors more than eight million spam and phishing attacks
daily. It has analyzed more than 37 billion web pages and
images.
IBM Security Services monitors billions of events per year from
more than 8,000 client devices in more than 100 countries. This
report includes data IBM collected between 1 January 2016 and
31 December 2016. In this year’s report, IBM X-Force Threat
Research adopted the MITRE Corporation’s Common Attack
Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) standard for
attack categorization.
The top five attacked industries were determined based on data
from a representative set of sensors from each industry. The
sensors chosen for the index had to have event data collected
throughout the entire year of 2016.
The insider/outsider identification utilized in this report includes
all source and destination IP addresses identified in the attacks
and security incidents targeting the representative set of
sensors. A single attack may involve one or many attackers.

THE SHIFTING WORLD OF BREACHES
The year 2016 was notable for the way in which cyber attacks
had a discernible impact on real-world events and infrastructure.
Beginning in December 2015, for example, reports appeared of
a malware-caused power outage in Ukraine,3 leaving hundreds
of thousands of people without electricity for several hours in
the middle of winter. Nearly a year later, a smaller but similar
Ukrainian power outage surfaced, also attributed to a cyber
attack.4 These two events bookended the year and served as
heralds of the widespread impact of security incidents on the
physical world, even to those who don’t regularly monitor the
security landscape.

World-changing leaks
This impact was most prominently registered through a number
of high-profile data leaks that had a direct influence on global
politics. In April 2016, 11.5 million leaked documents from the
Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca5 exposed offshore
accounting of thousands of prominent people from around the
world. The “Panama Papers,” as they were dubbed, showed
insider financials of several current and former heads of
state, their friends and family, as well as businesspeople and
celebrities. While offshore accounts are not illegal per se, they
often raise suspicion because they can be used for tax evasion
and money laundering. In addition to criminal investigations in

Phishing: The act of tricking a
user into providing personal or
financial information by falsely
claiming to be a legitimate entity.

79 countries,6 the disclosure led to anti-government protests in
several countries including Pakistan7 and the UK.8 In April 2016,
the Prime Minister of Iceland stepped down9 in the aftermath of
the leak.
In the US, data leaks were a central topic of the presidential
election. Several leaks from the Democratic National
Committee (DNC) provided an inside look into private email
conversations and strategies, and could have potentially
swayed the opinion of some voters for one candidate over
another. In both the Panama Papers and DNC leaks, it is
reported that attackers used simple techniques such as SQL
injection (SQLi)10 and phishing to exploit these influential
targets. The fact that vulnerability to fundamental security flaws
could have such far-reaching impact is notable.
In past years, data breaches were often in the form of a fixed set
of structured information such as credit card data, passwords,
national ID numbers, personal health information (PHI) data
or key documents. In recent years, X-Force has observed the
release of much larger caches of unstructured data, such as
the contents of emails, as well. In 2016, there were many notable
examples of leaks involving hundreds of gigabytes of email
archives, documents, intellectual property and source code,
exposing companies’ complete digital footprints to the public.

A history of incidents

Notable 2016 global leaks of unstructured data

X-Force has been tracking and reporting on publicly disclosed
security incidents and data breaches since 2011. Figure 3
(next page) illustrates a sampling of security incidents and
attack techniques during 2014, 2015 and 2016. In 2016, X-Force
observed several record-breaking metrics such as the number
of previously leaked records that surfaced during the year and
an increase in the size and scope of DDoS attacks.
While the number of leaked records is not the only indicator
of the impact of a breach, it is still a useful metric to track year
to year. In 2015, X-Force tracked just over 600 million leaked
records, down from more than one billion leaked in 2014. At over
4 billion, the number of records leaked in 2016 was more than
double that of both previous years combined.
The year 2016 was somewhat unusual, however, as several
“historical hacks” from breaches occurring in earlier years
surfaced publicly, with revelations that billions of previously
unreleased records were being sold on the Dark Web. These
leaked records are associated with the year in which the
organization disclosed the breach and not the year the breach
occurred. In some cases, it’s not known or disclosed when the
actual breach occurred.
In one significant example of a historical hack, Yahoo alerted
customers11 in December 2016 that the company had
discovered two breaches resulting in leaks of 500 million
records in 2014, and one billion records in 2013. And Yahoo’s

Several of these breaches, such as those occurring at LinkedIn,

though the impact was under-reported at the time. For example,
in 2012, LinkedIn disclosed a breach impacting 6.5 million
users, but in 2016, after a verifiable dump was posted for sale
on the Dark Web, it was revealed15 that 117 million emails and
passwords were actually stolen in that breach.

One of the dangers of these older leaks is that passwords often
were stored less securely than they are today, or in some cases,
millions of passwords were not encrypted at all. Many Internet
giants previously used easy-to-crack hashing algorithms such
as MD5.16 The result is that there are billions of email and plaintext password combinations available for those interested in
purchasing them—and many of these parties have successfully
used these credentials to hijack accounts on other sites and
services.

High-volume hijacks
During 2016, there were several high-profile account takeover
campaigns in which the targeted service was not breached,
but rather a large number of the targeted service’s customers
lost control of their accounts because they had reused the
same email and password from another Internet account. For
example, attackers captured more than 20 million accounts17
at the Chinese auction site Taobao in a brute force attack that
leveraged more than 100 million combinations of harvested
credentials from other breaches. They used these hacked
accounts primarily for sending spam, as well as bolstering the
reputation of select accounts, and manipulating supply and
demand of auction items.

Brute force attack: Use of trial and error
to obtain a user name and password for a
valid account on a web application to access
sensitive data such as credit card numbers.

Companies allowing virtual assets to be converted to currency,
including frequent buyer programs, loyalty cards and travel
points programs, were also targeted by account takeover.
Another novel use of comprised credentials was a campaign
to log in to Internet-facing PCs running remote administration
software. In June 2016, remote access service TeamViewer
reported an uptick18 in compromised accounts that was
believed to be linked to a flood of leaked credentials. People
who reused their LinkedIn password for their TeamViewer PC
login, for example, would be susceptible to this type of account
takeover.
One positive development during 2016 is that many companies
now are using more secure hashing functions such as bycrypt
to store passwords. The result is that even after a breach, such
as the theft of 43 million Weebly19 accounts and 87 million Daily
Motion20 accounts in October, it may be more difficult to crack
the passwords, devaluing the data and the scope of the attack.
Still, given the frequently reported top 10 password lists that
have been circulating for several years, it might be useful for
web services to reject some of the most common passwords
and require users to set something more secure.

When things go rogue
Whether motivated by political protest, crippling a competitor
or just for laughs, large-scale DDoS attacks have been a
mainstay for many years. Not long ago, 100Gbps attacks were
unprecedented—but by 2016, they were more of the norm.21
An attack on a French-based hosting provider,22 for example,
reportedly topped a gargantuan 1 Tbps. Tools for DDoS attacks
have become more accessible as well. In October, the opensource Mirai botnet was used to cause a large Internet-wide
disruption of major sites such as Etsy23 and Twitter by targeting
their DNS provider, Dyn.
Mirai24 is the latest evolution of DDoS attack malware,
weaponizing home routers and other connected devices,
including Internet-accessible camera systems and digital video
recording devices. Large botnets of Internet “things” can be
amassed due to the sheer number of these systems and their
ease of exploitation, due to basic security holes.
Another Internet of Things (IoT) DDoS botnet, dubbed Leet25
by security firm Incapsula, launched a 650Gbps attack in
December. One interesting feature of this attack was that it
used two different SYN payloads for maximum impact. Sending
a high packet rate of regular sized SYN packets (40 to 60 bytes)
and interspersing very large packets (799 to 936 bytes) makes
the attack difficult to mitigate because it ties up end systems
handling the requests with high volume number of packets and
floods switches with demands for huge bandwidth.

NOTABLE ATTACK VECTORS
Distributing malware through spam
Spam email remains a primary tool in the attacker’s toolkit,
reinforcing the pervasiveness of malware and the potential for
inadvertent insider attacks. Figure 4 shows the overall spam
volume observed by X-Force in its network of sensors in
2015 and 2016. The average monthly spam volume of the first
quarter of 2015 is shown as 100 percent, and the red in the bars
indicates the amount of spam with malicious attachments.

Among malicious attachments to spam, ransomware accounted
for the vast majority—85 percent. Ransomware continues to be
one of the most profitable forms of malware in terms of effort
versus earnings. While these attacks were already established
and profitable, the February 2016 case of a California hospital26
that paid a ransom of 40 Bitcoins (approximately USD17,000
at the time) to unlock encrypted files foreshadowed a renewed
campaign of similar attacks against the healthcare industry in
several countries. Given that disruptions of hospital operations
can be both financially damaging and literally matters of life
and death—exacerbated by outdated security processes
and infrastructure—the healthcare sector became a lucrative
worldwide target27 throughout the year.

to ransomware, read the IBM Security Ransomware

Shellshock: A family of security bugs
(aka “Bashdoor”) that uses vulnerable versions of Bash
command language to execute arbitrary commands
and gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

In a publicly reported breach during the summer of 2016, a SQLi
attack using the software vBulletin29 was used to steal millions
of user records30 from gamting forums and other sites with large
user bases. Even though a patch had been issued earlier, there
were still many sites running older or unpatched versions, and it
is often easy for attackers to scan the web for potential targets
running this software.
Manipulate data structures
The number two attack vector, accounting for 32 percent of
attacks, was the attempt to gain unauthorized access through
the manipulation of system data structures. As CAPEC states,
“Often, vulnerabilities [such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities],
and therefore exploitability of these data structures, exist due
to ambiguity and assumption in their design and prescribed
handling.”31

Attacks focused on the collection and theft of information
made up nine percent of attacks targeting client devices.
Most of these involved fingerprinting, often viewed as a
kind of pre-attack that gathers information on potential
targets to discover their existing weaknesses. Essentially, an
attacker compares output from a target system to known
“fingerprints” that uniquely identify specific details about the
target, such as the type or version of its operating system or an
application. Attackers can use the information to identify known
vulnerabilities in the target organization’s IT infrastructure.

The fifth most prevalent attack type, at three percent, involved
an attacker using what CAPEC describes as “probabilistic
techniques to explore and overcome security properties of the
target.”32 Most of the activity involved brute-force password
attacks, a tactic in which an intruder tries to guess a username
and password combination to gain unauthorized access to
a system or data. Most of the attacks observed by X-Force
targeted the Secure Shell (SSH) service. Users favor SSH
because it can provide secure remote access. On the downside,
however, it can provide attackers with shell account access
across the network.

Note that “Indicator” is not a CAPEC mechanism of attack.
A cyber-threat indicator consists of certain observable
conditions as well as contextual information about the
condition or pattern. These events, which accounted for four
percent of all attacks, could indicate either an attempted or a
successful attack on the target system. A large percentage
of the attacks involved targeted systems experiencing 100
or more external destinations in a short time, which might
indicate a compromised internal host. If compromised, a host
could be attacking other targets or communicating with other
compromised hosts.

Attacks attempting to manipulate some aspect of a system’s
resource state or availability accounted for three percent of
all attacks. Resources include files, applications, libraries and
infrastructure, and configuration information. Successful attacks
in this category could allow the attacker to cause a denial of
service, infect a machine to become a botnet command-andcontrol (C&C) server or execute arbitrary code on the target.

Subvert access control

Engage in deceptive interaction

Attacks attempting to subvert access control through the
“exploitation of weaknesses, limitations and assumptions
in the mechanisms a target utilizes to manage identity and
authentication”33 accounted for three percent of attacks.
Most of the attacks observed in this category involved the
exploitation of vulnerabilities in the target’s client-server
communication channel for authentication and data integrity by
leveraging the implicit trust a server places in what it believes to
be a valid client.

Two percent of attacks made attempts to fool victims into
opening malicious documents or clicking on links to malicious
sites. Particularly in the healthcare sector, these attacks are
proving very successful. Attack documents and links are often
delivered via phishing campaigns.

Two percent of attacks involved attempts to abuse or
manipulate “one or more functions of an application in order
to achieve a malicious objective not originally intended by
the application, or to deplete a resource to the point that the
target’s functionality is affected.”34 Successful attacks in this
category could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information
or cause a denial of service, as well as execute arbitrary code
on the target.
The Mirai IoT botnet conducted flooding attacks, which fall
under this category of attack. The Mirai botnet also played a
large role in several large telecom breaches during a “global”
Internet attack in mid- to late 2016.

Flooding attack: A technique in which an attacker
rapidly engages in a large number of interactions
with a target, consuming the target’s resources in
order to crash the target.

In terms of simple yet highly profitable attacks, reports of many
successful business email compromise (BEC) scams emerged
in the first half of the year, resulting in the theft of hundreds of
millions of US dollars. BEC is primarily a social engineering
attack in which attackers send an email pretending to be a
company official. They may send an email from a domain similar
to the victim’s domain, or actually take over the account of the
impersonated executive and mimic the person’s writing style.
In either case, an email is sent to an employee responsible for
company funds or employee tax records. With feigned urgency,
the employee is immediately requested to wire money, send
employee W-2 tax forms or leak other critical data. The US
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published an advisory35
about this threat that estimated more than USD3.1 billion had
been stolen by June 2016.
These attacks seemed to be more widely reported in the
first half of the year than the latter, perhaps indicating that
companies were more alert to these types of scams as the year
progressed. However, by early 2017, these attacks had renewed,
as tax season brought a renewed opportunity for attackers to
trick people into sending out W-2 forms.

TOP-TARGETED INDUSTRIES
Breaking out publicly disclosed security events in 2016, X-Force
sees that the industries experiencing the highest number of
incidents and reported records breached were information and
communications and government. It is worth noting that the
healthcare industry, which fell just outside the top five in terms
of records breached, continued to be beleaguered by a high
number of incidents. However, attackers focused on smaller
targets, resulting in a lower number of leaked records in that
industry.

While X-Force analyzes publicly disclosed breaches, IBM
also has the advantage of visibility into X-Force-monitored
security client environments. This visibility allows X-Force to drill
further into why certain industries may be more susceptible to
successful attacks. By comparing publicly disclosed breaches
with actual attack metrics from X-Force-monitored security
client environments, it’s possible to observe trends in the
security practices of different industries that may be a result of
regulatory or other governance practices.

Two common attack types stand out from the rest across these
five attacked industries: SQLi and OS CMDi—and that should
be no surprise. Cybercriminals often consider SQLi and OS
CMDi vulnerabilities to be “low-hanging fruit” or relatively easy
to exploit. And despite a downward trend in the number of

publicly disclosed SQLi and CMDi vulnerabilities, according
to data from the X-Force vulnerability database, attackers
continue to exploit the existing unpatched vulnerabilities in web
servers and applications.

Learn how researchers categorize patterns
of attacks according to CAPEC in an IBM blog.

Financial services
According to figures compiled by IBM Managed Security
Services, the financial services sector moved from the third
most-attacked industry in 2015 (behind healthcare and
manufacturing) to the first most-attacked in 2016, due primarily
to a large rise in SQLi and OS CMDi attacks. In this year,
these attacks alone were responsible for almost half of all
attacks among the financial sector of IBM Managed Security
Services customers. SQLi and OS CMDi are perhaps the most
popular attack vectors within this sector because successful
exploitation of these vulnerabilities provides attackers with the
ability to read, modify and destroy sensitive data. And there’s a
large amount of PII contained within the databases of financial
institutions.
Hackers value PII because it can be sold at a handsome profit,
and also can be held hostage, requiring the financial institution
to pay a ransom for its return or to prevent its public disclosure.

Buffer overflow: An exploitation method that
alters the flow of an application by overwriting
parts of memory. Buffer overflows are a
common cause of malfunctioning software.

In 2016, there was a notable rise in publicly reported Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
attacks against the messaging system used by thousands of
banks and companies to move money around the world.36 The
result was that millions of US dollars were stolen and illegally
transferred from various global banks using custom malware
and SQLi attacks.37 In 2017, SQLi and OS CMDi are positioned
to continue to be the primary methods of attacking data stores.
Access and authentication controls play a major role in financial
services security, and in 2016 subversion of these controls was
the second most prevalent type of attack on this sector. The
method of attack classified as “Subvert Access Control” is an
attack type commonly carried out by insiders to gain control of
end systems.

To learn more, check out the “Security Trends in
Financial Services” white paper from X-Force.

Information and communications
The information and communications technology sector moved
up into the top five attacked sectors, taking second place
among monitored industries in 2016. IBM-monitored security
client data shows the number one mechanism of attack in this
industry was “Manipulate Data Structures.” Buffer overflow
conditions, which fall under this attack category, were exploited

in many of these attacks, which accounted for 51 percent of all
attacks seen in this sector. SQLi and OS CMDi were the second
most frequent attack types detected in this sector during
2016, accounting for 30 percent of the total attacks, confirming
X-Force predictions38 that these attacks would not wane
anytime in the near future.

The second most popular attack mechanism in manufacturing
was “Abuse Existing Functionality,” which accounted for about
7 percent of all attacks detected. Many of these attacks involved
flooding a target system with a large number of requests,
to create a state of denial of service. “Collect and Analyze
Information” was in position number three at 6 percent.

Ranking as the third most prevalent attack type targeting
the information and communications technology sector was
the “Indicator” category, which was due largely to attempted
connections from Tor software exit nodes. Tor (an abbreviation
of the original project name, “The Onion Router”) is designed
to allow full anonymity to the end user. Although not all traffic
coming from the Tor network is indicative of an attack, by using
a Tor client, a cybercriminal can disguise the attack’s originating
network location and its path to the target, making identification
virtually impossible.

To learn more, check out the “Security Trends in
Manufacturing” white paper from X-Force.

Manufacturing
In 2016, SQLi accounted for the majority of all attacks—more
than 71 percent—in manufacturing. This industry is a tempting
target, as many systems within the sector are perceived to be
weak by design as a result of a failure to be held to compliance
standards.

-17-

Retail
The retail industry remains at risk from any threat that targets
credit card or gift card data. Retailers maintain an extremely
large amount of financial records and other personal
information such as credit card and Social Security numbers,
and SQLi and CMDi attacks are often used to steal this
information. These attacks accounted for 50 percent of all
attacks against the industry in 2016.
Buffer manipulation and brute force attacks took second and
third place during 2016, and collectively represent 28 percent
of the total attacks on retailers. One notable publicly disclosed
breach against a retailer occurred late in the year, when
attackers targeted accounts at a UK food delivery service by
using brute force authentication details gleaned from other

public data breaches. Customers who reused passwords
discovered that unauthorized food purchases had been made
via their hijacked accounts.39

To learn more, check out the “Security Trends in Retail”
white paper from X-Force.

Healthcare
SQLi and OS CMDi attacks represented the majority of attacks
within healthcare in 2016, at a combined 48 percent. Healthcare
records are always a top prize for cybercriminals and, as
X-Force has seen in the retail industry, are widely for sale on the
Dark Web.40
Attack methods categorized as “Manipulate Data Structures”
account for the second most popular attack type within the
industry and “Manipulate System Resources” is third. These
attacks focus on known vulnerabilities within an application,
which, when successful, can lead to full system compromise.
The category “Image File Attacks,” in which malicious code
is hidden within a variety of image file types, were the third
most prevalent type of attempted attacks seen in healthcare,
at 28 percent. Brute force attacks, which are part of a
CAPEC mechanism of attack named “Employ Probabilistic
Techniques,”41 used against authentication mechanisms, round
out the top attacks in position four, at 6 percent.

The industry experiencing the highest number of attacks in
2016 was financial services. The data for this sector reveals
a greater percentage (58 percent) of insider attacks versus
outsider attacks (42 percent). The insiders are composed of
both inadvertent actors (53 percent) and malicious insiders (5
percent).

security event that has been identified by correlation and
analytics tools as malicious activity that is attempting to collect,
disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information system resources
or the information itself. An attack may be carried out by a
single attacker sourced from one IP address, or many hundreds
of attackers from multiple IP addresses. A flooding attack is
one type of attack where there could be many attackers striking
within a short period of time. This is why DDoS attacks are
successful; attackers who wish to disrupt access to a service
or website can increase their attack traffic by using many
compromised hosts.

The fifth ranked sector, healthcare, also has a greater
percentage (71 percent) of insiders (inadvertent at 46 percent
and malicious at 25 percent) versus outsiders (29 percent). It
can be useful to think of inadvertent actors as compromised
systems carrying out attacks without the user being aware of it
as is the case with the “Subvert Access Control” attack type.
This often happens when a desktop client is compromised
via malicious email attachments, clickjacking, phishing or
vulnerable computer services that have been attacked from
another internal networked system.

The fact that the insider attacks targeting the financial services
and healthcare were largely the result of inadvertent actors
may be due these industries having a greater susceptibility
to phishing attacks. Organizations in these sectors should
focus on educating employees about phishing and how to
avoid becoming a victim, use a variety of approaches—video,
webinars, in-person instruction—and require training at intervals
to make the risk clear.
The remaining three of the top five attacked sectors had a
greater percentage of outside attackers than insiders. Within
information and communications, manufacturing, and retail, 60
percent of the attacks were categorized as “Inject Unexpected
Items” (58 percent by outsiders plus 2 percent by insiders). Of
the attacks categorized as “Inject Unexpected Items,” a total of
48 percent (46 percent by outsiders plus 2 percent by insiders)
of the total attacker count launched SQLi attacks. Another 10
percent (nine percent by outsiders plus one percent by insiders)
employed OS CMDi attacks.
The second highest mechanism of attack involving outsiders
falls within the category “Manipulate Data Structures.” These
attacks accounted for 23 percent of the total attackers, with
less than one percent coming from insiders. Most attacks
in this category were more specifically classified as “Buffer
Manipulation” attacks.

Buffer manipulation: A method of manipulating
an application’s buffer interaction to read or
modify data to which the attacker should not have
access. The buffer itself is the attack target.

Industries such as information and communications,
manufacturing, and retail experience more outsider attacks
because they may be seen as prime targets for exploitation
of SQLi, OS CMDi and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. To help
protect themselves organizations in these sectors may want to
review their patch management processes.

External attackers: Focus on organized
cybercrime
With the investigation into external actors, it’s necessary to
consider shifts in organized cybercrime during 2016. This was
a year when some countries experienced a marked increase in
financial cybercrime specifically. This portion of the report dives
deeper into findings from X-Force malware researchers who
investigate cybercrime trends and financial malware campaigns.
During 2016, X-Force researchers noticed some shifts in
the usual undercurrents of organized cybercrime. By using
techniques such as poisoned macros, exploit kits, fake fax
messages or alarming notices from attackers posing as tax
authorities, cybercriminals all too often find a way to make
victims click on their Pandora’s Box of threats and infect them

Poisoned macro: A macro embedded in an
office productivity file that features harmful code
or an exploit that will execute and cause the
endpoint to become infected if not fully patched.

Exploit kit: A programming tool that allows
someone who does not have any experience
writing software code to create, customize
and distribute malware.

with banking Trojans or ransomware. In the first quarter of 2016,
almost two-thirds of malware infections were Trojans,42 the
most powerful information stealers available to financially
motivated criminals.
Malware statistics gathered during 2013-2015 indicate that
during those years 431 million new malware variants joined the
existing pool of malware.43 The crimeware arena is replete with
mutations, and new strains become more varied every year.44
With this ongoing growth in new malware families, offspring
and hybrids, it is helpful to look at the big picture. In doing so,
X-Force found that 2016 was defined by the following high-level
trends:
•
•
•
•

Slow and steady wins the race
Cyber gangs sharpen the focus on business accounts

Venturing into additional cybercrime realms

Ransomware: Malware spread by
infected email attachments or programs
that encrypts data and demands
payment for a decryption key.

Malware family: Malware thought
to be linked to botnets and other
malware operators.

Cybercriminals aim to spread their malware as far and wide
as possible, since their profit relies on a numbers game. To
increase the chances of systems and software becoming
infected, the assumption has been that the more spam they
send out, the better. But this is no longer true. Today, spreading
malware via mass spam blasts can draw unwanted attention
and, in many cases, detection by security solutions.
As a result of this close scrutiny of spam, malware can be
captured and meticulously analyzed, its communication
infrastructure can be identified and blacklisted, and the
malware’s lifecycle can be drastically shortened. By the time
the criminals are ready to attack after their infection campaigns,
banks and other businesses often already have protections
in place, considerably lowering the percentage of successful
attacks.
On the consumer side, Internet service providers can more
easily identify and block mass campaigns that spread malware
using email, storage devices, or compromised or malicious
websites that redirect visitors to exploits and infection zones.
Identifying and blocking campaigns can result in their reaching
many fewer people than the criminals intend.

Malware offspring: A new version
of malware that is thought to be
created by the same developer as
another type of malware.

The balancing act between the desire to mass distribute
malware and the risk that mass campaigns will result in easy
detection does not affect the lower end, opportunistic malware
such as ransomware, IoT bots, or keyloggers. That’s because
these threats are often spread by affiliates or amateurs and not
by an organized gang, and they continue to be cast in wide nets.
This phenomenon has become clear to the more sophisticated
cybercrime gangs, and in 2016, X-Force researchers saw them
change tactics in an attempt to avoid detection and analysis at
all costs.
One of the techniques malware attackers use in their attempt
to evade detection is to change the malware’s dropper and
the dropper’s anti-security features, the malware’s deployment
flow, and the malware’s persistence mechanisms. Those are the
popular “moving parts” where developers can invest relatively
small amounts of time and expect to see an improved ability
to bypass anti-virus software and some security tools. These
sorts of changes happen almost every week, for example, in
the type of financial malware that cyber gangs own and operate.
With a relatively small investment having the potential for big
returns, X-Force predicts criminals will continue to use these
tactics.

one country. These campaigns allow specified IP address
ranges to run the malware, and then carefully test the malware’s
success without allowing it to unveil its secrets.
For example, the operators of the Zeus Sphinx botnet, which
surfaced in 2016, have shown extremely careful and precise
operating patterns. Not only are the malware configurations
targeting one country at a time, but X-Force researchers
noticed that the campaigns often used a barely-there attack
strategy by deploying the payload on only five machines at
a time, evaluating successful exploitation and immediately
vanishing. Sphinx emerged in 2016 as commercial malware,
so even unsophisticated cyber gangs can use the toolkit.
This might very well be the case with recent Sphinx botnets
discovered in Canada and in Australia,45 as criminals are
making frequent upgrades to the malware’s security evasion
mechanisms.
Another example of a tactic to evade detection is the GootKit
Trojan.46 This malware appears to be owned by one cyber
gang that targets banks in Europe, specifically favoring the
UK, France, Italy and Spain. GootKit typically separates
configurations for each country, and many times it will target a
relatively small number of banks in each geography. According

Another interesting method of evading detection that emerged
in 2016 is the use of minimal campaigns, often targeting only

to X-Force research, GootKit’s developers appear to frequently
change the malware’s security evasion mechanisms, and their
careful distribution keeps them off the radar as they continue to
operate slowly and silently.
Perhaps the most interesting example of 2016 is the Dridex
malware—a banking Trojan owned by one of the top
cybercrime gangs, active since 2014. Dridex campaigns47
became smaller overall in 2016, at times vanishing48 altogether.
It appears that Dridex’s operators’ top goals for 2016 were to
sharpen its focus on business accounts,49 where they were
hoping to find larger sums of money to steal, route stolen funds
through uncommonly targeted countries50 such as Latvia and
Estonia, and diversify their income using ransomware.51
In their efforts to continually launch fraud attacks, Dridex’s
operators reduced the amount of wide-spread spam, created
more specific email ploys to target employees, and preferred
the use of Microsoft Office document macros to deliver their
Trojan. At times they even password-protected the files52 to
prevent automated detection.
Cyber gangs sharpen the focus on business accounts
Touching on the trend of working slowly and steadily, especially
in the use of malware such as Dridex, criminals are increasing

their focus on either consumer or business bank accounts, and
configuring malware to target only the desired type.
Examining malware configurations fetched by banking Trojans
up until 2014, X-Force in 2016 identified a mixed-bag of targets
of all types, with a majority of personal banking services
emerging as the top target according to URL count.
In mid-2014, however, when the Dyre Trojan entered the
cybercrime arena, a more focused approach began to emerge,
this time targeting business accounts more than personal
banking. Since then, the business focus has grown more
pronounced in the number of URLs targeting business banking
services, in the specification of targeted URLs, and in specific
elements targeted in a bank’s web applications for business
customers.
In 2016, X-Force saw a number of organized cyber gangs
sharpen focus on businesses in this manner. Some examples of
the malware used include:
Dridex: At least 50 percent of its targets are business banking
services53
GozNym: 52 percent of its targets are business banking
services54
TrickBot: 42 percent of its targets are business banking
services55

Organized gangs lean toward targeting businesses because
they can steal more money at a time than they could with
consumer accounts. Gangs are also the type of players in the
cybercrime arena that have the necessary resources at their
disposal to steal larger amounts of money. These resources
include:

While some low-level vendors continued to sell executable
files they could generate from their existing malware builders,
X-Force saw little evidence of developers selling full kits of
banking Trojans with all the necessary modules, a proper
“license” and all the bug fixes and technical support fraudsters
have been accustomed to buying.

• Experienced fraudsters who can conduct reconnaissance
and plan out the fraud scenario, which often entails the theft
of millions of dollars at a time56
• Funding to hire professional criminal call centers to support
the fraud process and manipulate the victim
• Straw companies and straw men to funnel, then cash out
millions in stolen funds and launder them afterward

In 2016, it became quite evident that commercial malware was
making a comeback in a number of ways:

Commercial malware making the rounds
Commercial banking Trojans, sold as ready-made malware
kits that can be purchased and easily deployed, were severely
curtailed on most underground boards after law enforcement
agencies managed to infiltrate the ranks57 of the Internet’s
criminal underbelly in 2010-2012. That precedent had a lasting
effect on malware authors who have been much more careful
ever since.

Overlay malware: A type of mobile
malware designed to mimic the look and feel
of a legitimate target application.

• Android overlay malware replaced banking Trojans as the
  “banking malware” commodity in open and semi-open
forums on the cybercrime underground.
• Ransomware and ransomware-as-a-service offerings are
low-cost money makers for gangs that wish to make a
minimal up-front investment.
• New malware variants built on the Zeus v2 source code,
leaked in 2011, kept Zeus at the top of the list of prolific

Malware actors are often cybercrime factions or gangs whose
goal is to steal the largest amounts of money and act as
quickly as possible. Eighty percent of cybercrime is conducted
by organized crime,59 which often tends to diversify60 its illicit
income sources. In 2016, cybercriminals acted like traditional
organized crime gangs by also diversifying their illicit profit
sources.
One example of diversifying illicit profit sources is the
Dridex banking Trojan and the Locky61 ransomware duo.
Online banking fraud facilitated by Dridex is one of the most
sophisticated malware operations in the cybercrime arena,
and not only is ransomware technically inferior, operating
ransomware demands much less knowledge and skill, which
has attracted lower-level criminals to it in the past decade. But
there is a connection now between them, and it appears that
Locky adds a new profit source to the Dridex gang.
Dridex botnets began distributing Locky in early 2016. At first
the relationship seemed unlikely, but it later became clearer that
the two are indeed bound together through common malware
campaigns, distribution by the Necurs botnet,62 and notably, in
some campaigns, Dridex samples downloaded Locky into a
TEMP folder and executed it.

A similar occurrence came in the shape of a rather unique new
Trojan hybrid. In April 2016, X-Force researchers uncovered
the case of a ransomware dropper, Nymaim, into which a Gozi
banking Trojan module was embedded, creating a new twoheaded beast: GozNym.63
In virtually no time, the evidently well-funded joint GozNym64
gang abandoned the ransomware business, for the most part,
and began launching financial fraud attacks on banks in the US.
GozNym then expanded its attack scope into Europe, launching
redirection attacks on Polish,65 English66 and German banks.67
Before long, its aggressive debut garnered GozNym some
attention from law enforcement and saw some of its operators
arrested68 and indicted before the end of 2016.

Whether deluged by spam or targeted by cybercrime,
organizations of all kinds clearly must continue to practice
security fundamentals. To complement a solid information
security foundation, organizations can continue to engage in
collaboration to learn best practices and share findings and
insights with colleagues. The faster they react to cybercrime
findings and share their experiences across the security
community, the less time each malware variant can live and
or see successful fraud attacks. As a result, cybercrime can
become much less financially viable for attackers, as exposure
can weed out large numbers of fraudsters who abandon their
criminal pursuit for lack of profit.

Beyond sharing intelligence, IBM Security has evolved to bring
cognitive capabilities into the fight against cybercrime, with
the goal of transforming it altogether. IBM Watson® for Cyber
Security is already being used by 40 organizations, where it is
helping spot cyber attacks. Cognitive computing is not only 30
to 40 percent faster than traditional systems,69 it also continually
learns and doesn’t repeat the same mistake twice, reducing
false positives, and keeping up with threats. Before long,
cognitive cybersecurity could outsmart human cybercrime and
turn the tables on cybercriminals.
