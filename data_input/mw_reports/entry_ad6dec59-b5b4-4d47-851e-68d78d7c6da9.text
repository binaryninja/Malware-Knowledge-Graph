During an incident response investigation in the final quarter of 2017, BlackBerry Cylance
incident responders and threat researchers uncovered several bespoke backdoors
deployed by the OceanLotus APT Group (a.k.a. APT32, Cobalt Kitty), as well as evidence
of the threat actor using obfuscated CobaltStrike Beacon payloads to perform command
and control (C2).
While continuing to monitor activity of the OceanLotus APT Group, our researchers
uncovered a novel payload loader that utilizes steganography to read an encrypted payload
concealed within a .png image file.
The steganography algorithm appears to be bespoke and utilizes a least significant bit
approach to minimize visual differences when compared with the original image to prevent
analysis by discovery tools.
Once decoded, decrypted, and executed, an obfuscated loader will load one of the APT32
backdoors.
Thus far, BlackBerry Cylance has observed two backdoors being used in combination with
the steganography loader â€“ a version of Denes backdoor (bearing similarities to the one
described by ESET), and an updated version of Remy backdoor.

However, this can be easily modified by the threat actor to deliver other malicious payloads.
The complexity of the shellcode and loaders shows the group continues to invest heavily in
development of bespoke tooling.
This new white paper describes the steganography algorithm used in two distinct loader
variants and looks at the launcher of the backdoor that was encoded in one of the .png
cover images.
