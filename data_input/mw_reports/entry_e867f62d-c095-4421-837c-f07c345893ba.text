Our researchers have been following the Gamaredon Group (aka Primitive Bear) for years
now, but ever since the Russo-Ukraine war broke out - they've been more relevant than ever.
January 14, 2022 marked the first Russian cyber-war move, when a series of reports were
published claiming Russian cyber attacks on the Ukrainian government - numerous
government websites taken down or defaced, various targeted attacks using WhisperGate on
Ukrainian organizations, and more. Since then, Russia has been playing hard in the cyber
battlefield - and Gamaredon is a lead player.

Who is the Gamaredon Group
The Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013, not long before Russia annexed
the Crimean peninsula. Over the years, speculations about their primary motives have been
confirmed, with security researchers seeing multiple attacks targeting Ukrainian government
organizations and officials. Last year, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) publicly
attributed the adversary to five Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers posted in
Crimea. The SSU has also claimed that Gamaredon is capable of surpassing extremely
successful Russian APTs like APT28 (Sofacy/Fancy Bear), SNAKE (Turla), and APT29 (Cozy
Bear/The Dukes) in the scale of their attacks and damage.

Infection Tactics
Gamaredon usually leverages email spear phishing using malicious office file attachments to
infect their victims. But that's not all - the APT has a few creative tricks up its sleeve. Once
example is their campaign targeting a Western government entity. Instead of the classic
email phish, they played out a meticulous, precise attack by submitting a malicious
downloader camouflaged as a CV onto a job search platform.

Once the malicious file is opened by the victim, a remote template injection technique is set
in action. allowing the file to pull a malicious VBS script. The script then checks in with the
APT's command and control (C2) servers, and after a wait period (6 hours for example), it

will pull a SelF-eXtracting (SFX) archive - one of Gamaredon's signature moves. The threat
actor has been spotted using this tactic to bundle in evasive remote access persistence tools
to victims machines for years. Today, Gamaredon uses UltraVNC, which gives the C2 server
control of the compromised system. VBS files are also usually bundled in the payload, and a
custom Gamaredon malware is downloaded.

Malware Variants
Different Gamaredon attacks have used different malware variants over time. For many years
now, the threat actor has been using their own custom-created malware variants.
PowerPunch is Gamaredon's droppers and downloader family, which shares it's evasiveness
characteristic with Pterodo. The backdoor uses various obfuscation techniques, while giving
the attackers interactive access to the network so they can carry out their attack plans.
QuietSieve, another custom malware, steals information from the target host such as
doc, docx, xls, rtf, odt, txt, jpg, pdf, rar, zip and 7z files, as well as screenshots taken by the
malware. Other malware families employed by Gamaredon include ObfuMerry, ObfuBerry,
DilongTrash, DinoTrain, and DesertDown.

Infrastructure
Gamaredon has been seen changing infrastructure over time. Analyzing hundreds of IOCs
used by the APT in the past and present, it's clear that their favorite registrar by a landslide
has always been REG-RU. Recently, Cisco released a table mapping the different IP spaces
heavily associated with Gamaredon infrastructure.

By integrating over 900 different threat intelligence feeds, ThreatSTOP provides
comprehensive coverage of Gamaredon IOCs for optimum protection. As new IOCs are
discovered, they are swiftly added to our system and propagated to blocklists and policies on
all ThreatSTOP-protected networks. Our Core Threats IP and domain bundles allow
customers to block thousands of Gamaredon infrastructure IOCs, including the related REG-

RU IP address spaces. Users who want to block Russia as a whole, not only by geo-blocking
Russia, but also Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and by blocking sanctioned Russian-related
entities, can do so with our Russia Related bundles.
