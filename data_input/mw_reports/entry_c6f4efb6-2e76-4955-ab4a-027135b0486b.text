Technical Analysis of Industrial Spy Ransomware
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-industrial-spy-ransomware

Industrial Spy is a relatively new ransomware group that emerged in April 2022. In some
instances, the threat group appears to only exfiltrate and ransom data, while in other cases
they encrypt, exfiltrate and ransom data. Industrial Spy started as a data extortion marketplace
where criminals could buy large companies' internal data; they promoted this marketplace
using README.txt files that were downloaded using malware downloaders disguised as cracks
and adware. After these initial promotional campaigns, the threat group introduced their own
ransomware to create double extortion attacks that combine data theft with file encryption. The
threat group appears to have also seemingly tried Cuba ransomware briefly before developing
their own ransomware in May 2022.

Key points
Industrial Spy is a relatively new group that emerged in April 2022 that started by
ransoming stolen data and more recently has combined these attacks with ransomware.
The threat group exfiltrates and sells data on their dark web marketplace, but does not
always encrypt a victim’s files.
The ransomware utilizes a combination of RSA and 3DES to encrypt files.
Industrial Spy lacks many common features present in modern ransomware families like
anti-analysis and obfuscation.
The threat group is consistently adding roughly two to three victims per month on their
data leak portal.

There are two primary executables associated with Industrial Spy. The first binary does not
implement any destructive functionality, while the second performs file encryption. The former
has been mainly distributed using cracks, adware and other malware loaders. Zscaler
ThreatLabz has observed this binary being distributed in-the-wild with other loaders and
stealers involving SmokeLoader, GuLoader and Redline Stealer. The sole purpose of this
malware is to promote their dark web marketplace; it does not inflict any actual damage to the
targeted system.

Technical Details
This malware is very basic and performs the following actions before deleting itself:
Display a text-based note promoting the Industrial Spy data leak site (as shown in Figure
1).

Enumerate paths under the registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList and drop the file readme.txt recursively under all paths with
the same note content.
Change the wallpaper (shown in Figure 2) to advertise the Industrial Spy data leak
marketplace.

Industrial Spy Ransomware
The Industrial Spy threat group introduced their own ransomware in May 2022. The Industrial
Spy ransomware family is relatively basic and parts of the code appear to be in development.
Industrial Spy utilizes very few obfuscation methods other than building strings on the stack at
runtime. The ransomware also lacks many of the features commonly seen in modern
ransomware families (such as anti-debug, anti-sandbox, etc.), although this may change in the
future.
Currently, there are not many Industrial Spy ransomware samples that have been observed inthe-wild. However, the group is consistently adding roughly two new victims per month on their
data leak portal.

Technical Details
The Industrial Spy ransomware encryption and decryption both are handled by the same
binary. Simplified steps taken by the ransomware are as follows:
Parse command-line arguments
Delete shadow copies
Start an encryption thread to encrypt all drives or given paths
Self-delete

Delete Shadow copies
3/11

Similar to other ransomware families, Industrial Spy deletes Windows shadow copies to make
file recovery more difficult as shown in Figure 3.

Mode of Operation
On execution, Industrial Spy checks whether an RSA public or RSA private key is embedded in
the binary. Depending on the type of key, the ransomware will encrypt or decrypt files as shown
below:
if ( mw_ptr_key_encryption_public == 0x1F ){
if ( mw_ptr_key_decryption_private != (char)0xF1 ) {
// decrypt files
}
} else {
// encrypt files
}

Interestingly, it will always delete shadow copies irrespective of the mode.
If command-line arguments are provided, Industrial Spy will start a thread to recursively encrypt
files for each path argument that is provided. If no arguments are given, Industrial Spy will
enumerate all drives and start one thread per volume (if it is not read-only). Each thread will
recursively enumerate and encrypt files. All files for which the extension and path does not fall
under the exclusion list will be encrypted. Paths containing the following strings are excluded:
\microsoft\
\google\chrome
\mozilla\firefox
\opera\

4/11

The following file extensions are also excluded:
.

.mst

.inf1

.shs

.dll

.scr

.cmd

.ps1

.jse

.bat

.paf

.ins

.u3p

.exe

.sct

.com

.reg

.vbscript

.bin

.pif

.inx

.vb

.gadget

.shb

.cpl

.rgs

.msi

.job

.vbs

.isu

.vbe

.lnk

.ws

.msc

.wsf

.wsh

During encryption, if the targeted file is locked by another process, Industrial Spy will attempt to
terminate the process that holds the corresponding file handle, using the Restart Manager API.
File Encryption
Industrial Spy encrypts each file’s content with the Triple DES (3DES) algorithm. Each 3DES
key and initialization vector (IV) are then encrypted with a hardcoded RSA public key. The
result is appended with a footer to the encrypted file data. Industrial Spy will encrypt up to the
first 100MB of data. Since 3DES is a block cipher, each block is padded accordingly with NULL
(0x00) bytes to form a multiple of 24 bytes.
After encryption, the original file content is overwritten with the following data shown in Figure
4.

Figure 4: Industrial Spy encrypted file structure
The encrypted file data structure is as follows:
struct encrypted_file {
byte 3des_encrypted_file_content[encrypted_size];
byte rsa_encrypted_key_blob[128];

5/11

qword original_file_size;
dword end_of_encrypted_file_marker; // 0xFEEDBEEF
};
The encryption parameters data structure is the following:
struct rsa_encrypted_key_blob {
word block_type; // 0x200 (used to validate RSA decryption result)
byte random_bytes[77]; // random byte padding
byte null; // 0x00
byte 3des_key[24]; // used for file data encryption
byte iv[24]; // only the first 8 bytes are used
};
Unlike nearly all ransomware families, Industrial Spy does not change the file extension after
encryption. Therefore, the filename itself cannot be used to determine the files that have been
encrypted. Instead, Industrial Spy appends a file footer that can be used to identify encrypted
files using the last four bytes: 0xFEEDBEEF.
RSA Key
The RSA code used by Industrial Spy is very similar to the ISFB trojan’s source code. This
RSA library was also used by the ransomware known as WastedLocker. Each Industrial Spy
ransomware sample contains a hardcoded 1,024-bit RSA key that is unique to each victim in
the following format:

Figure 5: Embedded Industrial Spy RSA public key
The first dword (4-bytes) in blue is the size of the RSA key in bits (0x400), which is 1,024 bits.
The RSA key size is then followed by the modulus highlighted above in turquoise. The modulus
contains a number of NULL bytes for padding, finally followed by the RSA public exponent (in
orange) along with additional padding.
Key Generation
Industrial Spy generates a per file 3DES key and IV using the RSA library’s random function
R_GenerateBytes(). This function takes a random structure as an argument to generate these
values. The random structure itself is seeded by calling the x86/x64 CPU instruction rdtsc,

6/11

which returns the processor’s timestamp. The CPU processor timestamp records the number
of CPU clock cycles since the last reset. The result of rdtsc is passed to the RSA random
function R_RandomUpdate().
The R_GenerateBytes() function is called twice to generate two 24-byte pseudorandom
buffers. The first buffer is used as a 3DES key for encrypting the file’s data, and the first 8 bytes
from the second buffer are used as the IV.
A Python-based proof-of-concept Industrial Spy ransomware decryptor can be found in the
Zscaler ThreatLabz GitHub tools repository.

Ransom Note
A file with the name readme.html is dropped in each directory that contains a ransom note as
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Example Industry Spy ransom note
A copy of the Industrial Spy ransom note can be found in the ThreatLabz GitHub ransom note
repository here.

Victim ID
The Victim ID referred to as the personal id in the ransom note is just the MD5 hash of the
modulus component of the embedded RSA public key.

Dark Web Market
The Industrial Spy leak portal is protected with a username and password as shown below in
Figure 7.

Figure 8: Industrial Spy market home page
The first victim on the leak site was listed on 03/15/2022. The total victim count as of 25 July
2022 was 37, and are broken down into the following categories:
24 Free
13 General
0 Premium
Industrial Spy is mostly selling individual files (in the General category) instead of file bundles
in the price range from $1 to tens of thousands of dollars. The group likely reviews the files
before deciding whether to put a high price tag on sensitive files, and dumps the rest of the files
with a $1 to $2 price tag. ThreatLabz has observed operating system files that have limited
value like desktop.ini, thumbs.db listed for $2 as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9: Operating system files (e.g., desktop.ini) listed by Industrial Spy for $2

Conclusion
Industrial Spy is a new entrant in the ransomware ecosystem. The malware is not currently
very sophisticated, but the file encryption is functional making it a dangerous threat.
Furthermore, Industrial Spy is consistently adding new victims, proving that the threat group
has the capabilities to breach new organizations. Many players come and go in the
ransomware market and it is difficult to determine the groups that will stay for the long term.
However, this threat group is likely to stay at least in the near future with more ransomware
updates and features to follow. ThreatLabz continues to monitor all kinds of threats and provide
coverage to our customers.
