THREAT OVERVIEW
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
WWS facilities may be vulnerable to the following common tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) used by threat actors to compromise IT and OT networks, systems, and devices.
•

•

•

Spearphishing personnel to deliver malicious payloads, including ransomware [T1566].
o Spearphishing is one of the most prevalent techniques used for initial access to IT
networks. Personnel and their potential lack of cyber awareness are a vulnerability
within an organization. Personnel may open malicious attachments or links to execute
malicious payloads contained in emails from threat actors that have successfully
bypassed email filtering controls.
o When organizations integrate IT with OT systems, attackers can gain access—either
purposefully or inadvertently—to OT assets after the IT network has been
compromised through spearphishing and other techniques.
o Exploitation of internet-connected services and applications that enable remote access
to WWS networks [T1210].
o For example, threat actors can exploit a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that is
insecurely connected to the internet to infect a network with ransomware. If the RDP is
used for process control equipment, the attacker could also compromise WWS
operations. Note: the increased use of remote operations due to the COVID-19
pandemic has likely increased the prevalence of weaknesses associated with remote
access.
Exploitation of unsupported or outdated operating systems and software.
o Threat actors likely seek to take advantage of perceived weaknesses among
organizations that either do not have—or choose not to prioritize—resources for IT/OT
infrastructure modernization. WWS facilities tend to allocate resources to physical
infrastructure in need of replacement or repair (e.g., pipes) rather than IT/OT
infrastructure.
o The fact that WWS facilities are inconsistently resourced municipal systems—not all of
which have the resources to employ consistently high cybersecurity standards—may
contribute to the use of unsupported or outdated operating systems and software.
Exploitation of control system devices with vulnerable firmware versions.
o WWS systems commonly use outdated control system devices or firmware versions,
which expose WWS networks to publicly accessible and remotely executable
vulnerabilities. Successful compromise of these devices may lead to loss of system
control, denial of service, or loss of sensitive data [T0827].

WWS Sector Cyber Intrusions
Cyber intrusions targeting U.S. WWS facilities highlight vulnerabilities associated with the following
threats:
•
•

Insider threats from current or former employees who maintain improperly active credentials
Ransomware attacks

TLP:WHITE
WWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:
•

•

•

•
•

In August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a Californiabased WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for about a month and
was discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers
displayed a ransomware message.
In July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto a
Maine-based WWS facility’s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system was run
manually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more frequent
operator rounds.
In March 2021, cyber actors used an unknown ransomware variant against a Nevada-based
WWS facility. The ransomware affected the victim’s SCADA system and backup systems. The
SCADA system provides visibility and monitoring but is not a full industrial control system
(ICS).
In September 2020, personnel at a New Jersey-based WWS facility discovered—what they
believed to be—Makop ransomware had compromised files within their system.
In March 2019, a former employee at Kansas-based WWS facility unsuccessfully attempted to
threaten drinking water safety by using his user credentials, which had not been revoked at
the time of his resignation, to remotely access a facility computer.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS
The FBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA recommend WWS facilities—including DoD water treatment facilities
in the United States and abroad—use a risk-informed analysis to determine the applicability of a
range of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.

WWS Monitoring
Personnel responsible for monitoring WWS should check for the following suspicious activities and
indicators, which may be indicative of threat actor activity:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Inability of WWS facility personnel to access SCADA system controls at any time, either
entirely or in part;
Unfamiliar data windows or system alerts appearing on SCADA system controls and facility
data screens that could indicate a ransomware attack;
Detection by SCADA system controls, or by water treatment personnel, of abnormal operating
parameters—such as unusually high chemical addition rates—used in the safe and proper
treatment of drinking water;
Access of SCADA systems by unauthorized individuals or groups, e.g., former employees and
current employees not authorized/assigned to operate SCADA systems and controls.
Access of SCADA systems at unusual times, which may indicate that a legitimate user’s
credentials have been compromised.
Unexplained SCADA system restarts.
Unchanging parameter values that normally fluctuate.

Remote Access Mitigations
Note: The increased use of remote operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic increases the
necessity for asset owner-operators to assess the risk associated with enhanced remote access to
ensure it falls within acceptable levels.
•
•
•
•
•

•

Require multi-factor authentication for all remote access to the OT network, including from the
IT network and external networks.
Utilize blocklisting and allowlisting to limit remote access to users with a verified business
and/or operational need.
Ensure that all remote access technologies have logging enabled and regularly audit these
logs to identify instances of unauthorized access.
Utilize manual start and stop features in place of always activated unattended access to
reduce the time remote access services are running.
Audit networks for systems using remote access services.
o Close unneeded network ports associated with remote access services (e.g., RDP –
Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389).
When configuring access control for a host, utilize custom settings to limit the access a remote
party can attempt to acquire.

Network Mitigations
•

•

Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks to limit the
ability of malicious cyber actors to pivot to the OT network after compromising the IT network.
o Implement demilitarized zones (DMZs), firewalls, jump servers, and one-way
communication diodes to prevent unregulated communication between the IT and OT
networks.
Develop/update network maps to ensure a full accounting of all equipment that is connected to
the network.
o Remove any equipment from networks that is not required to conduct operations to
reduce the attack surface malicious actors can exploit.

Planning and Operational Mitigations
•

•
•

Ensure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of potential
impacts that cyberattacks pose to operations, including loss or manipulation of view, loss or
manipulation of control, and threats to safety.
o The plan should also consider third parties with legitimate need for OT network access,
including engineers and vendors.
o Review, test, and update the emergency response plan on an annual basis to ensure
accuracy.
Exercise the ability to fail over to alternate control systems, including manual operation while
assuming degraded electronic communications.
Allow employees to gain decision-making experience via tabletop exercises that incorporate
loss of visibility and control scenarios. Utilize resources such as the Environment Protection

Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center
(MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.

Safety System Mitigations
•

Install independent cyber-physical safety systems. These are systems that physically prevent
dangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a threat actor.
o Examples of cyber-physical safety system controls include:
 Size of the chemical feed pump
 Gearing on valves
 Pressure switches, etc.
o These types of controls benefit WWS Sector facilities—especially smaller facilities with
limited cybersecurity capability—because they enable facility staff to assess systems
from a worst-case scenario and determine protective solutions. Enabling cyberphysical safety systems allows operators to take physical steps to limit the damage, for
example, by preventing cyber actors, who have gained control of a sodium hydroxide
pump, from raising the pH to dangerous levels.

Additional Mitigations
•
•

•

•

•

•

Foster an organizational culture of cyber readiness. See the CISA Cyber Essentials along with
the items listed in the Resources section below for guidance.
Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network
assets. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets and
zones should participate in the patch management program. Consider using a centralized
patch management system.
Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-todate signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network
assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.
Implement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.
o Regularly test backups.
o Ensure backups are not connected to the network to prevent the potential spread of
ransomware to the backups.
When possible, enable OT device authentication, utilize the encrypted version of OT
protocols, and encrypt all wireless communications to ensure the confidentiality and
authenticity of process control data in transit.
Employ user account management to:
o Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible.
o Implement account lockout policies to reduce risk from brute-force attacks.
o Monitor the creation of administrator-level accounts by third-party vendors with robust
and privileged account management policies and procedures.
o Implement a user account policy that includes set durations for deactivation and
removal of accounts after employees leave the organization or after accounts reach a
defined period of inactivity.

•

•

Implement data execution prevention controls, such as application allowlisting and software
restriction policies that prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,
such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers.
Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social
engineering attempts. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
