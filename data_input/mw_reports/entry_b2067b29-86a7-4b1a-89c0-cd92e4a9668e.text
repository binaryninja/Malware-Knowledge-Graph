The Use of the Sliver C2 Framework for Malicious Purposes

1/9

The proliferation of Cobalt Strike during the early 2020s has been undeniable, and its impact unquestionable. In
response to this challenge, the detection strategies of defenders have steadily matured. Consequently, threat actor
decision making with regards to tooling is likely evolving too. We therefore decided to identify and track Cobalt
Strike “alternatives”, specifically off-the-shelf Offensive Security Tools (OST).

In this post we will discuss the Sliver C2 framework and its usage for potentially malicious purposes since the start
of 2022.

Sliver is a Golang based implant and thus is compatible with the major operating systems. Our focus centered on
the detection of new Sliver samples associated with Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems, and the
extracted network infrastructure contained within those samples. To understand threat actor TTPs, we
subsequently tracked network telemetry for the wider C2 infrastructure in cases where Sliver was deployed.

Key Findings
Sliver utilized as a beachhead for the initial infection tool-chain
Sliver utilized in the ransomware delivery framework for attacks observed in the wild
Sliver deployed via active opportunistic scanning and possible exploitation of Log4j / VMware Horizon
vulnerabilities
Sliver utilized in the targeting of organizations within Government, Research, Telecom, and University
sectors, in addition to sporadic victims of opportunity

Identification of Sliver Samples
Sliver’s current advantage lies in its obscurity alongside other less commonly utilized OSTs, with most
organizations still focused on Cobalt Strike detection. This opens a possible gap in coverage – no one can be
expected to detect all the things. This gap exposes organizations to the risk of these lesser known, yet still highly
capable, OST C2 frameworks.
During Q1 of 2022, we observed 143 Sliver samples, detected with the potential for usage as a first stage tool in
malicious activity. For comparison, 4,455 samples of Cobalt Strike were observed within the same time-period.
Based on the continued prevalence of Cobalt Strike, organizations focusing on detection of that toolset are
certainly justified. However, if organizations have the resources to do so, we strongly recommend some study of
Sliver to identify possible detection opportunities.

This should be considered an anecdotal analysis of samples, as no detection rule is infallible, and no
malware corpus complete. It is also not feasible to distinguish between legitimate versus malicious use for
the totality of samples identified.

What follows is our analysis of two distinct malicious campaigns which leveraged Sliver for C2 purposes.

Sliver Campaign 1 – “Scan & Exploit”
2/9

193.27.228.127 (SELECTEL, RU)
C2 PORTS: 8888, 13338, 23338, 33338

Between 03 February – 04 March 2022 Sliver samples were discovered, utilizing Russian-hosted infrastructure, in
the targeting of organizations in various sectors distributed globally. These samples and associated C2 IP
(193.27.228.127) were deemed malicious, based on observations of 193.27.228.127 sweeping ranges in an
indiscriminate manner, likely seeking exploitation opportunities.

Data from GreyNoise further highlighted the use of 193.27.228.127 for malicious purposes, targeting Log4j and
Exchange (ProxyShell) vulnerabilities.

Based on the identification of Virlock samples (as discussed later in this blog) it is assessed that in some cases the
actors sought to monetize the accesses they had gained.

In one instance, a victim was observed connecting to TCP/80 on 193.27.228.127, potentially indicative of an
exploitation of Log4j, with subsequent connections to 193.27.228.127:8888. This victim was identified running
VMware Horizon and was therefore likely vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

The use of TCP/8888 aligns with several identified Sliver samples configured to communicate with
193.27.228.127. After a period of approximately 14 days, we observed the C2 communications ‘migrate’ to
TCP/13338, TCP/23338, and TCP/33338.

NOTE: TCP/8888 is associated with Sliver’s default mTLS configuration, the use of the additional TCP ports
ending in *3338 appeared more unique to this threat actor and were utilized in circumstances where victim
communications persisted over extended time-periods.

The following samples (Table 1) were observed communicating with C2 IP 193.27.228.127.

When generating payloads, the Sliver configurator outputs a binary based on a naming convention of
RANDOMWORD1_RANDOMWORD2.exe by default.

In this case, Sliver was utilized for C2 communications in the first stage of the breach activity. A subsequent
sample, identified as Atera Remote Management software, also communicated with 193.27.228.127. This sample
was first uploaded to VirusTotal on February 11, 2022. It appeared the actor used these two tools in concert,
potentially switching to the use of Atera after initial compromise was achieved.

176.113.115.107 (Red Bytes LLC, RU)
C2 PORTS: 8888, 13338, 23338, 33338

Approximately 30 days after first observing victim communications with 193.27.228.127, the actor was observed
switching victims to a new C2 IP (176.113.115.107), again assigned to a provider in Russia. As previously, victim
communications continued over TCP/13338, TCP/23338, and TCP/33338.

‘In-the-wild’ file names for samples communicating with 176.113.115.107 continued to point towards exploitation of
Log4j and VMware Horizon vulnerabilities (Table 2).

In addition to the above referenced samples, a sample with possible Virlock ransomware capabilities was also
observed communicating with 176.113.115.107. This sample was first uploaded to VirusTotal on March 11, 2022.
This finding is indicative of the actor attempting to monetize the access gained by deploying ransomware on a
compromised host. It is unclear whether ransomware deployment was the intended final goal in every case.

45.9.148.243 (NICEIT, DM)
C2 PORT: 8888

Finally, in recent days an additional Sliver sample was detected, communicating with a ‘new’ C2 IP (45.9.148.243)
assigned to a provider in Dominica. Network telemetry data does not indicate any current victim communications
and it is unclear how this sample / C2 IP is connected to this activity. Updates on this activity will be posted on

One of the challenges faced when tracking this activity was the volume of noise generated by the ongoing
exploitation of hosts via vulnerabilities in utilities such as Log4j and Exchange. In several cases, we observed the
same victim likely compromised by multiple threat actors. However, what can be concluded is the apparent
utilization of Sliver in malicious activity, coupled with the continuous scanning, exploitation, and triage of victim
infrastructure.

The activity associated with this cluster was previously commented on in other public reporting:

Sliver Campaign #2 – Pakistan & Turkey
The second campaign identified leveraging Sliver was deemed malicious based on the domain name utilized by
the actors, which appeared to target government entities in Pakistan and Turkey.

The detected Sliver samples communicated with ping.turkey.g0v.cq.cn, which resolved to IP 16.162.223.161
(AMAZON-02, US).

Network telemetry data for 16.162.223.161 did not identify current victim communications, however this does not
rule out ongoing or future malicious activity.
Passive DNS data for 16.162.223.161 identified three further domains resolving to this IP address:
nationalhelpdesk.pk
pkgov.org
sngpl.org.pk
Given the similarity in the apparent spoofing of government entities, it was inferred that these domains related to
the domain (ping.turkey.g0v.cq.cn) identified in the Sliver samples.
A further pivot on pkgov.org identified an email address (abdulrehm8282@gmail.com) used in the domain
registration. This email address was used in the registration of two further domains, which resolved to IP
15.152.186.38 (AMAZON-02, US):
ntcgov.org
uno-desk.org
In this case, network telemetry for 15.152.186.38:80 provided evidence of inbound connections from potential
victims located in Pakistan.

NTC is likely a reference to one of two Pakistani organizations; the National Telecom Corporation, or the
National Technology Council.

Data from our Botnet Analysis and Reporting Service (BARS) indicated that a Cobalt Strike Beacon server was
listening on TCP/80 of 15.152.186.38, associated with the following shellcode sample:
SHA-256: bc94d6ed7abfea4239e941817cdad65a0a243e2e4a718ef401db4cbbef0bf478

6/9

Passive DNS data for ntcgov.org identified several subdomains, providing an insight into the intended targets of
this campaign:
dxb.ntcgov.org
geo-raabta.ntcgov.org
geo-tv.ntcgov.org
The string dxb possibly relates to DXB, the airport code for Dubai International, and the string raabta possibly
relates to a project undertaken by the Centre for Pakistan and Gulf Studies.
It could be inferred that this campaign was undertaken to gain insight into collaborative projects conducted
between Pakistan and the Gulf States (which includes Dubai, UAE).

CONCLUSION
We have observed a steady increase in detected Sliver samples over Q1 of 2022, providing insight into actor
deployment methods and objectives. Of note we identified two separate campaigns which leveraged Sliver for
likely malicious purposes. The latter campaign highlighted the potential use of both Sliver and Cobalt Strike in
conjunction with each other. As previously stated, the threat posed by malicious utilization of Cobalt Strike has not
diminished, however we would recommend that organizations also remain mindful of other OSTs, by applying
resources to develop detection mechanisms for frameworks like Sliver.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Improve visibility

Consider an attack surface management solution to track remediation of vulnerable assets.
Be proactive
Monitor (and hunt externally, beyond your network perimeter) for Sliver with community Snort / YARA rules,
for example:
7/9

UK NCSC (link)
Travis Green (link)

Monitor and hunt internally within your infrastructures, look specifically for Sliver as an initial payload, or in
concert with other OSTs (like Cobalt Strike).
Research

Review threat actor TTPs where Sliver was leveraged in previous malicious campaigns, for example:
SANS (link)
@pathtofile (link)
