Summary:
This was a great find, Terror EK in the wild from malvertising. The landing page appeared to
be in the compromised site itself and was not loaded from an iframe, etc. The site just
displayed jibberish (Lorem Ipsum). The EK used three Flash files, attempted a Silverlight
exploit and triggered several interesting ET signatures. There was also almost no obfuscation
of the code as well.
The payload was Tofsee and a thanks goes to @Antelox for confirming it. Tofsee is a
spambot known to send spam emails. It has been dropped by Rig EK in the past. I did not
see much email traffic however I was using a proxy which may have caused some traffic to
not be logged.
Anyway this is a great find and I hope you can gain a lot of information from it.

The malvertising chain let to a website that contained jibberish but also hosted the
entire landing page with little to no attempt to obfuscate it. Below is a snippet:

Terror EK uses a variety of exploits and has three different Flash files. The Flash files
had not been uploaded to VT before for over a year.

The payload was Tofsee, thanks to @Antelox for confirming this. It actually dropped two
payloads but they both had the same hash despite one having the old style “rad”
naming.
