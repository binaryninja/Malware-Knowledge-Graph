The Gh0st malware is a widely used remote administration tool (RAT) that originated in China
in the early 2000s. It has been the subject of many analysis reports, including those
describing targeted espionage campaigns like Operation Night Dragon and the GhostNet
attacks on Tibet. Musical Chairs is a multi-year campaign which recently deployed a new
variant Gh0st we’ve named “Piano Gh0st.”
Our evidence suggests the actors behind these attacks have been operating for over ﬁve
years and have maintained a single command and control server for almost two. They use
compromised e-mail accounts to distribute their malware widely and their targeting appears
opportunistic rather than speciﬁc.
The overall motivation of this campaign is unclear at this time. Gh0st is very versatile as it
allows an adversary to take complete control over the infected system including installing
additional malware.

Tracking the Gh0st
Using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus we have identiﬁed Gh0st variants associated with
Musical Chairs leading back to mid 2013. The source code and building tools for Gh0st are
available freely on the web; anyone who is so inclined can build their own version of the
malware. The way researchers diﬀerentiate between most variants is based on their “magic
tag.”
Gh0st uses a custom TCP protocol to connect to a command and control (C2) server and
retrieve instructions from the attacker. The malware identiﬁes itself to the server by sending a
string of characters (the magic tag), which the server repeats back to conﬁrm the connection
(See Figure 1.)
In the original version this string was “Gh0st” but in subsequent versions many diﬀerent
strings are used. These strings, along with the actual location of the command and control
server (domain and/or IP address) allow us to associate various Gh0st samples with a single

attacker or group. In 2011, Norman released a paper that showed many clusters of Gh0st
samples that were connected based on these tags.

Figure 1. Gh0st “magic tag” value sent over custom TCP protocol
Using these tags in the network traﬃc, the command and control infrastructure and other
characteristics of the attacks, we have grouped together a series of attacks into the one
campaign, named Musical Chairs.
The functionality of Gh0stRat (3.6) is well documented by multiple sources and is summarized
below:
Keylogging
Remote terminal access
Remote audio and video access
File management
Remote ﬁle download and execution
Process explorer and additional system enumeration capabilities
GUI interaction (remote control)
Self Update
Reset of SSDT to remove existing hooks

Spreading the Gh0st
The Gh0st variants used in the Musical Chairs campaign are distributed using phishing emails. The threat actors behind the attacks use a “shotgun” approach, blasting e-mails to as
many recipients as possible in hopes of tricking a small percentage of targets into opening
the attack. The attackers generally do not rely upon any vulnerability exploitation, and instead
rely on the user to open the attached executable to compromise their system. Additionally,
the phishing messages are sent from US-based residential ISP e-mail addresses. The
accounts themselves appear to be legitimate, and are likely also compromised by this actor.
In many cases the phishing e-mails are sent indiscriminately to all e-mail addresses in an
infected user’s address book, including “no-reply” addresses a human operator would know
to ignore.
While Gh0st itself does not have built in e-mailing components, it is also possible that an
additional payload is responsible for the propagation via e-mail.

The following list contains known ﬁlenames of attachments used in the delivery stage of the
Musical Chairs campaign:
“Pleasantly Surprised.exe”
“Beautiful Girls.exe”
“Sexy Girls.exe”
“gift card.exe”
“amazon gift card.pdf.exe”
The subject of the e-mails carrying these ﬁles typically matches the ﬁlename itself and does
not contain any sophisticated attempts at social engineering. The attacks detected thus far by
Palo Alto Networks WildFire have been exclusively in the United States and do not appear to
target any particular industry.

Infrastructure
The infrastructure used in Musical Chairs stands out primarily due to its longevity and use of
multiple Gh0st command servers on the same host. At the center of the infrastructure for the
last two years is a Windows 2003 server using the IP address 98.126.67.114. The server uses
a US-based IP address, but displays a Chinese language interface for Remote Desktop
connections.

Thus far Unit 42 has identiﬁed 32 diﬀerent Gh0st samples connecting to this server dating
back to July of 2013. The Gh0st C2 software operates on Windows and allows the attacker to
specify which port it should listen on for connections from infected systems. The attacker
may host multiple Gh0st C2s on this server at one time, or may change the hosting TCP port
very frequently. The 32 samples we have identiﬁed connect to 19 diﬀerent TCP ports.

While 98.126.67.114 is the longest standing command and control server, it is not the only
server used by Musical Chairs. The malware typically ﬁnds this server using a domain that is
registered by the attacker and the registration information used by these C2 domains has
allowed us to identify additional infrastructure used in these attacks.

Figure 3. Diagram of relationships between Musical Chairs C2 domains and related
infrastructure
These many related domains put the approximate start date of this campaign in 2010. The
earliest versions of the attacks we’ve found are still visible in e-mail groups and public
Facebook postings. Figure 4 shows an e-mail with the subject “my girlfriend’s self-view
video” that contains a link to an executable hosted on nvzm.info, one of the domains
associated with the Musical Chairs infrastructure.

Figure 4. Screenshot of e-mail linking to nvzm[.]info using a “self-view video” theme.
The image below shows a Facebook post from 2012 with a similar theme and a diﬀerent link

to a URL that is also part of the same infrastructure map.

Figure 5. Screenshot of Facebook posting including a diﬀerent “video” theme.
Finally, we located a user who posted to the Gmail Help forum in 2010 requesting assistance
with ridding their system of malware. He states that all of his contacts received one of the
“self-view” phishing e-mails after his system was compromised.

Figure 6. Screenshot of request on Gmail help forums related to “self-view” video e-mails.
While we have not been able to identify the speciﬁc malware used to distribute these spam
messages, the infrastructure and the themes used in the e-mails connect them directly back
to Musical Chairs happening this year.

Piano Gh0st
In July, Musical Chairs began deploying a new variant of Gh0st, which we’ve named “Piano
Gh0st.” This variant uses a new wrapper ﬁle to hide the Gh0st payload. The ﬁles are
delivered as a self-extracting executable (SFW) that acts as the dropper. It is responsible for
extracting its payload to “c:\microsoft\lib\ke\Piano.dll” and executes the “mystart” function
within the DLL’s export address table (EAT) using rundll32.exe.

Figure 7. Screenshot of calls observed by Palo Alto Wildﬁre from within the AutoFocus
interface.
The “Piano.dll” ﬁle itself has very little functionality other than decrypting, loading and running
an embedded DLL. It decrypts the embedded DLL using the Blowﬁsh symmetric cipher with a
simple key consisting of the character “y”. “Piano.dll” proceeds to load the newly decrypted
DLL manually and calls the exported function “my start”. The decrypted DLL has the following
attributes:
MD5: 8182a33cc1268c0c3b4e3d9a02d912c9
SHA256: 32026e702cﬀ8fd3f113473ea2698eab0ca181aa2d0fd0e8802e31aa3befa94a

Type: PE32 executable for MS Windows (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit
Size: 148008 bytes
Imphash: 9c01d71c9bf78d231a313c86540e284c
Compiled: 2015-07-14 02:11:32
Exports:
(0x123f0) mystart
This embedded DLL is the actor Gh0stRat Trojan, speciﬁcally version 3.6. The following
debugging path is found within the DLL, which suggests the individual who compiled this DLL
has a Chinese language pack (GB2312 speciﬁcally) installed:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\
\GetRawInputData_dlll
_Mutext_LSPlayer_20150708\gh0st3.6\Server\svchost\Release\

_win7bug

_

The Trojan maintaings persistence on the infected system by creating an entry in the registry
at “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” with the key “nvidiake” and
value “c:\microsoft\lib\ke\vv.js”, as seen in Figure 8.

Figure 8. AutoFocus view of registry key modiﬁcations made by Piano Gh0st to maintain
persistence through system reboots
The ﬁle “vv.js” in the registry key is a simple one-line JavaScript that executes the “vvv.bat”
ﬁle, as seen in the following:
1 new ActiveXObject('Wscript.Shell').Run('cmd /c c:\\microsoft\\lib\\ke\\vvv.bat',0);

The ‘vvv.bat’ ﬁle is a batch ﬁle that executes the Piano.dll payload in the same way as the
initial dropper, using “rundll32.exe” to call the “mystart” exported function, as seen in the
following:
1 rundll32.exe

c:\microsoft\lib\ke\Piano.dll mystart

After setting up the registry keys for persistence, the Gh0stRat sample begins communicating
with its command and control server using a custom network protocol. The magic tag used
by this version of Gh0st is “clarkclar1” as seen in Figure 9. This variant also communicated
with a command and control server using the domain www.meitanjiaoyiwang[.]com, which is
hosted by 98.126.67.114 on tcp port 200.

Figure 9. Screenshot of Piano Gh0st variant using the “clarkclar1” magic tag.

Detection and Prevention
Palo Alto Networks WildFire detected the Gh0st malware, including the Piano Gh0st variant,
as malicious based on the behavior the attack ﬁles exhibit on an infected system.
Additionally, we have deployed threat prevention signatures to detectPiano Gh0st alongside
our previously deployed signatures for earlier Gh0st variants. AutoFocus users can ﬁnd more

information about this threat using the MusicalChairs tag.
The following indicators identify attacks using Piano Gh0st and the Musical Chairs campaign.
