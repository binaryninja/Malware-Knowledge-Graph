The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning that hackers
are exploiting a critical vulnerability in Zoho’s ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus password
management solution that allows them to take control of the system.
ADSelfService Plus is aimed at larger organizations that need an integrated self-service
password management for and single sign-on solution for Active Directory and cloud apps.

Exploits detected in the wild
The security issue is identified as CVE-2021-40539. It is considered critical as it can allow a
remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

Zoho has published a security advisory to announce that an update that patches the bug is
currently available for ADSelfService Plus.
In a security notification week, the company says that it is “noticing indications of this
vulnerability being exploited” in the wild.
The alert from CISA is clear about this, though, as the agency informs that “CVE-202140539 has been detected in exploits in the wild.”
At this moment, information about the vulnerability is scarce. A severity score has not been
calculated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. but Zoho notes
that the issue is critical:
“An authentication bypass vulnerability affecting REST API URLs, that could result in
remote code execution,” the company says.
Organizations with ADSelfService Plus builds lower than 6114 are urged to apply the latest
update from the developer, available using the service pack.
