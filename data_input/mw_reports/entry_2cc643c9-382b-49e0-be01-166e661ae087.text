Summary
Worm:Win32/Yimfoca.A is a worm - a self-propagating program that can spread itself from
one computer to another. Worms may spread themselves via a variety of different channels
in order to compromise new computers. Commonly, worms may spread directly by copying
themselves to removable or network drives, or by attempting to exploit particular
vulnerabilities on targeted computers. Worms also often attempt to spread via platforms that
require user interaction in order to run. They may send themselves as an attachment to an
email or an instant message, or send a link to a copy of themselves in the body of a
message. In these cases the message needs to be convincing enough to encourage the
victim to click on the link or attachment and run or download a copy of the worm.
To detect and remove this threat and other malicious software that may have been installed
in your computer, run a full-system scan with an up-to-date antivirus product such as the
following:
Microsoft Security Essentials
Microsoft Safety Scanner
