RevengeHotels is a targeted cybercrime malware campaign against hotels, hostels, hospitality
and tourism companies, mainly, but not exclusively, located in Brazil. We have conﬁrmed more
than 20 hotels that are victims of the group, located in eight states in Brazil, but also in other
countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain,
Thailand and Turkey. The goal of the campaign is to capture credit card data from guests and
travelers stored in hotel systems, as well as credit card data received from popular online travel
agencies (OTAs) such as Booking.com.
The main attack vector is via email with crafted Word, Excel or PDF documents attached. Some
of them exploit CVE-2017-0199, loading it using VBS and PowerShell scripts and then installing
customized versions of RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT and other custom
malware such as ProCC in the victim’s machine. The group has been active since 2015, but
increased its attacks in 2019.
In our research, we were also able to track two groups targeting the hospitality sector, using
separate but similar infrastructure, tools and techniques. PaloAlto has already written about one
of them. We named the ﬁrst group RevengeHotels, and the second ProCC. These groups use a
lot of social engineering in their attacks, asking for a quote from what appears to be a government
entity or private company wanting to make a reservation for a large number of people. Their
infrastructure also relies on the use of dynamic DNS services pointing to commercial hosting and
self-hosted servers. They also sell credentials from the affected systems, allowing other
cybercriminals to have remote access to hotel front desks infected by the campaign.
We monitored the activities of these groups and the new malware they are creating for over a
year. With a high degree of conﬁdence, we can conﬁrm that at least two distinct groups are
focused on attacking this sector; there is also a third group, though it is unclear if its focus is
solely on this sector or if carries out other types of attacks.

Not the quotation you’re expecting
One of the tactics used in operations by these groups is highly targeted spear-phishing
messages. They register typo-squatting domains, impersonating legitimate companies. The
emails are well written, with an abundance of detail. They explain why the company has chosen
to book that particular hotel. By checking the sender information, it’s possible to determine
whether the company actually exists. However, there is a small difference between the domain
used to send the email and the real one.

An email sent to a hotel supposedly from an attorney’s ofﬁce

This spear-phishing message, written in Portuguese, has a malicious ﬁle attached misusing the
name of a real attorney ofﬁce, while the domain sender of the message was registered one day
before, using a typo-squatting domain. The group goes further in its social engineering effort: to
convince the hotel personnel about the legitimacy of their request, a copy of the National Registry
of Legal Entities card (CNPJ) is attached to the quotation.
The attached ﬁle, Reserva Advogados Associados.docx (Attorneys Associates
Reservation.docx), is a malicious Word ﬁle that drops a remote OLE object via template injection
to execute macro code. The macro code inside the remote OLE document contains PowerShell
commands that download and execute the ﬁnal payload.

PowerShell commands executed by the embedded macro

In the RevengeHotels campaign, the downloaded ﬁles are .NET binaries protected with the Yoda
Obfuscator. After unpacking them, the code is recognizable as the commercial RAT RevengeRAT.
An additional module written by the group called ScreenBooking is used to capture credit card
data. It monitors whether the user is browsing the web page. In the initial versions, back in 2016,

the downloaded ﬁles from RevengeHotels campaigns were divided into two modules: a backdoor
and a module to capture screenshots. Recently we noticed that these modules had been merged
into a single backdoor module able to collect data from clipboard and capture screenshots.
In this example, the webpage that the attacker is monitoring is booking.com (more speciﬁcally, the
page containing the card details). The code is speciﬁcally looking for data in Portuguese and
English, allowing the attackers to steal credit card data from web pages written in these
languages.
In the ProCC campaigns, the
downloaded ﬁles are Delphi
binaries. The backdoor installed in
the machine is more customized
than that used by RevengeHotels:
it’s developed from scratch and is

clipboard and printer spooler, and
capture screenshots. Because the
personnel in charge of conﬁrming reservations usually need to pull credit card data from OTA
websites, it’s possible to collect card numbers by monitoring the clipboard and the documents
sent to the printer.

Screenshot is captured when the user copies something to the clipboard or makes a print
request

A bad guy’s concierge
According to the relevant underground forums and messaging groups, these criminals also infect
front desk machines in order to capture credentials from the hotel administration software; they
can then steal credit card details from it too. Some criminals also sell remote access to these
systems, acting as a concierge for other cybercriminals by giving them permanent access to steal
new data by themselves.

Access to hotel booking systems containing credit card details is sold by criminals as a service

Some Brazilian criminals tout credit card data extracted from a hotel’s system as high quality and
reliable because it was extracted from a trusted source, i.e., a hotel administration system.

Guests and victims
The majority of the victims are associated with the hospitality sector. Based on the routines used,
we estimate that this attack has a global reach. However, based on our telemetry data, we can
only conﬁrm victims in the following countries:

Victims conﬁrmed in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain,
Thailand and Turkey

Based on data extracted from Bit.ly statistics, we can see that potential victims from many other
countries have at least accessed the malicious link. This data suggests that the number of
countries with potential victims is higher than our telemetry has registered.

A safe stay
RevengeHotels is a campaign that has been active since at least 2015, revealing different groups
using traditional RAT malware to infect businesses in the hospitality sector. While there is a
marked interest in Brazilian victims, our telemetry shows that their reach has extended to other
countries in Latin America and beyond.
The use of spear-phishing emails, malicious documents and RAT malware is yielding signiﬁcant
results for at least two groups we have identiﬁed in this campaign. Other threat actors may also
be part of this wave of attacks, though there is no conﬁrmation at the current time.
If you want to be a savvy and safe traveler, it’s highly recommended to use a virtual payment card
for reservations made via OTAs, as these cards normally expire after one charge. While paying
for your reservation or checking out at a hotel, it’s a good idea to use a virtual wallet such as
Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. If this is not possible, use a secondary or less important credit card,
as you never know if the system at the hotel is clean, even if the rooms are…
