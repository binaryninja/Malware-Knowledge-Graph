Tactics that Lazarus Group used to siphon money from India's Cosmos Bank were highly
sophisticated, Securonix says.

North Korean-linked Lazarus Group is believed responsible for stealing $13.5 million from
India's Cosmos Bank in a brazen attack that has exposed limitations in the measures banks
use to defend against targeted cyber threats.
The theft occurred between August 10 and August 13, 2018, and was enabled via thousands
of fraudulent ATM transactions across 28 countries and by at least three unauthorized
money transfers using the bank's access to the SWIFT international financial network.
It is still unclear how the threat actors managed to initially infiltrate the bank's network. But
based on how Lazarus Group actors have typically operated in the past, the attackers broke
in via a spear-phishing email and then moved laterally within the bank's network, according
to researchers at Securonix.

"This attack is a good example of the fact that, while ATM and SWIFT transaction monitoring
is important, it often is not enough, and may only give you 10%-20% of the required
detection coverage," the security vendor noted in its report.
The Cosmos Co-operative Bank is a 111-year old co-operative bank in India with branches in
7 states and 39 major cities. Between August 10 and August 11, Lazarus Group operators
managed to compromise an end-user system at the bank and used that to access and
compromise the institution's ATM infrastructure.
Publicly available information and Securonix' own analysis suggest that the attackers used
multiple targeted malware exploits to set up a malicious ATM/POS proxy switch in parallel
with Cosmos Bank's own central switch.
They then broke or redirected the connection between the bank's ATM/POS central switch
and its back-end Core Banking System. Securonix described the banking switch as a
component that is primarily used to perform routing and transaction-processing decisions.
"Based on the publicly available details, most likely there was noadditional hardware
installed," says Oleg Kolesnikov, a member of the Securonix threat research team. "The
malicious payment switch typicallycomes in the form of software, so this is likely what was
installedand/or cloned/modified by the attackers to proxy the requests fromthe ATM terminals
instead of the existing switch."
ATM Withdrawls
The attackers are believed to have increased the withdrawal limits on hundreds of targeted
accounts at the bank and set them up so cash withdrawals could be made from the accounts
from abroad. In total, operators working on behalf of Lazarus Group used 450 cloned nonEMV debit cards linked to accounts at Cosmos Bank to make some 12,000 international ATM
withdrawals and 2,849 domestic transactions totaling $11.5 million.
Because the attackers had previously tampered with the link between the banks' ATM switch
and the core banking system, the required messages and codes for authorizing the debit
card withdrawals were never forwarded to the core banking system. So typical checks on
card number, card status, and PIN were never conducted. Instead, the attackers used the
rogue ATM/POS switch that they had installed to send fake instructions for authorizing the
fraudulent transactions.
About two days after the initial break-in, the attackers gained access to Cosmos Banks'
SWIFT environment and used it to illegally transfer $2 million to an account belonging to a
trading company at Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong.
The attack on Cosmos Bank's ATM network was different from typical jackpotting and black
box attacks where attackers physically tamper with ATMs to get them to spit out large
amounts of cash. In this case, the attack targeted the bank's core infrastructure and
2/3

effectively bypassed all measures recommended by the Interpol for protecting a bank's ATM
infrastructure against logical attacks, Securonix said.
What remains unclear is why Cosmos Bank did not receive any alerts when the connection
between its ATM switch and core banking system was cut or when thousands of ATM
transactions that were clearly not normal were being made.
"We do not know for certain, but it is likely that the connection wasredirected such that the
connection remained active, and only themalicious requests in question were selectively
redirected by themalicious component," Kolesnikov says. This would ensure that the
malicious requests never made it to thelegitimate payment switch, and therefore were never
visible at thecore backend system, he says.
The attack also likely involved a lot of malicious and suspicious attack behaviors that the
bank should have spotted.
Based on the publicly availabledetails, the attackers had to stand up a proxy switch capable
ofresponding to malicious transaction requests from the terminals, Kolesnikov says.
Theyalso likely had to install some targeted malware components needed tomonitor the card
management process and the payment infrastructure, togain access to the SWIFT terminals
and to understand the standardoperating procedures.
