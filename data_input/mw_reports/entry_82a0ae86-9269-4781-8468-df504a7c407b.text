Hackers have breached a server belonging to MonPass, one of Mongolia’s largest certificate
authorities (CA), and have backdoored the company’s official client with a Cobalt Strikebased backdoor.
The backdoor was active inside the company’s official certificate installer app between
February 8 and March 3 this year, security firm Avast said in a report today.

Incident has the hallmarks of a cyber-espionage campaign
The security breach came to light in late March when Avast discovered the backdoored
installer and backdoor on one of its customers’ systems.
From March to June, the security firm has been working with the CERT Mongolia team and
MonPass to investigate the intrusion, with MonPass providing a cloned image of the
compromised server to Avast for further investigations.

Our analysis beginning in April 2021 indicates that a public web server hosted by
MonPass was breached potentially eight separate times: we found eight different
webshells and backdoors on this server.

But despite having access to the compromised server, the Avast team said it was not able to
attribute the intrusion “with an appropriate level of confidence” to any specific threat actor.
“However it’s clear that the attackers clearly intended to spread malware to users in Mongolia
by compromising a trustworthy source, which in this case is a CA in Mongolia,” researchers
added.

Signs point to a Chinese threat actor
But while Avast was not able to link the intrusion to a specific threat actor, previous cyberespionage activity recorded in Mongolia and other Asian countries point the finger towards
Beijing.
For example, in December 2020, security firm ESET discovered that a Chinese hacking
group compromised a software company that supplied software to multiple Mongolian
government agencies.
In the same month, Avast also disclosed details about a Chinese cyber-espionage campaign
that targeted government agencies using spear-phishing emails, during which the threat
actor tried to install backdoors and keyloggers on employee workstations.
In an incident eerily similar to the MonPass breach, a Chinese cyber-espionage group also
breached and inserted malware inside the certificate installation app provided by the Vietnam
Government Certification Authority (VGCA), a Vietnamese CA that provided digital
certificates to local companies and government agencies.
These past campaigns and the fact that the threat actor removed the backdoor on its own,
most likely after infecting the desired target, suggest this was a highly targeted attack against
a high-profile Mongolian entity rather than a run-of-the-mill financially-themed malware
distribution scheme.
A MonPass spokesperson was not available for comment on the Avast report, but Avast said
the company appears to have cleaned up its server and notified customers who downloaded
its backdoored client app earlier this year.
