New Rook Ransomware Feeds Off the Code of Babuk

First noticed on VirusTotal on November 26th by researcher Zack Allen, Rook Ransomware
initially attracted attention for the operators’ rather unorthodox self-introduction, which stated
that “We desperately need a lot of money” and “We will stare at the internet”.

These odd pronouncements prompted some mirth on social media, but they were followed a
few days later by more serious news. On November 30th, Rook claimed its first victim: a
Kazkh financial institution from which the Rook operators had stolen 1123 GB of data,
according to the gang’s victim website. Further victims have been claimed since then.
In this post, we offer the first technical write up of the Rook ransomware family, covering both
its main high-level features and its ties to the Babuk codebase.

Technical Details
Rook ransomware is primarily delivered via a third-party framework, for example Cobalt
Strike; however, delivery via phishing email has also been reported in the wild.

Individual samples are typically UPX packed, although alternate packers/crypters have been
observed such as VMProtect.
Upon execution, Rook samples pop a command window, with differing output displayed. For
example, some versions show the output path for kph.sys (a component of Process
Hacker), while others display inaccurate information around the use of ADS (Alternate Data
Streams).

dropping kph.sys
The ransomware attempts to terminate any process that may interfere with encryption.
Interestingly, we see the kph.sys driver from Process Hacker come into play in process
termination in some cases but not others. This likely reflects the attacker’s need to leverage
the driver to disable certain local security solutions on specific engagements.
There are numerous process names, service names and folder names included in each
sample’s configuration. For example, in sample
19CE538B2597DA454ABF835CFF676C28B8EB66F7 , the following processes, services and
folders are excluded from the encryption process:

As with most modern ransomware families, Rook will also attempt to delete volume shadow
copies to prevent victims from restoring from backup. This is achieved via vssadmin.exe .

Rook & vssadmin.exe as seen in SentinelOne console
The following syntax is used:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet

Early variants of Rook were reported to have used a .TOWER extension. All current variants
seen by SentinelLabs use the .ROOK extension.

In the samples we analyzed, no persistence mechanisms were observed, and after the
malware runs through its execution, it cleans up by deleting itself.

Babuk Overlaps
There are a number of code similarities between Rook and Babuk. Based on the samples
available so far, this appears to be an opportunistic result of the various Babuk source-code
leaks we have seen over 2021, including leaks of both the compiled builders as well as the

actual source. On this basis, we surmise that Rook is just the latest example of an apparent
novel ransomware capitalizing on the ready availability of Babuk source-code.
Babuk and Rook use EnumDependentServicesA API to retrieve the name and status of
each service that depends on the specified service before terminating. They enumerate all
services in the system and stop all of those which exist in a hardcoded list in the malware.
Using OpenSCManagerA API, the code gets the Service Control Manager, gets the handle
and then enumerates all services in the system.

Rook service termination

In addition, both Rook and Babuk use the functions CreateToolhelp32Snapshot ,
Process32FirstW , Process32NextW , OpenProcess , and TerminateProcess to
enumerate running processes and kill any found to match those in a hardcoded list.

Babuk and Rook share the same process exclusion list
Also similar is the use of the Windows Restart Manager API to aid with process termination,
which includes processes related to MS Office products and the popular gaming platform
Steam.

Process termination
We also noted overlap with regards to some of the environmental checks and subsequent
behaviors, including the removal of Volume Shadow Copies.
Both Babuk and Rook check if the sample is executed in a 64-bit OS, then delete the
shadow volumes of the user machine. The code flows to
Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection to disable file system redirection before calling
ShellExecuteW to delete shadow copies.

Babuk VSS deletion (similar to Rook)
Babuk and Rook implement similar code for enumerating local drives. Rook checks for the
local drives alphabetically as shown below.

The Rook Victim Website
Like other recent ransomware varieties, Rook embraces a dual-pronged extortion approach:
an initial demand for payment to unlock encrypted files, followed by public threats via the
operators’ website to leak exfiltrated data should the victim fail to comply with the ransom
demand.

Rook’s welcome

message (TOR-based website)
This TOR-based site is used to name victims and host any data should the victim decide not
to cooperate. Rook also uses the site to openly boast of having the “latest vulnerability
database” and “we can always penetrate the target system” as well as their desire for
success: “We desperately need a lot of money”.
These statements appear under the heading of “why us?” and could be intended to attract
affiliates as well as convince victims that they mean business.

About Rook (TOR-based website)
At the time of writing, three companies have been listed on the Rook blog, spanning different
industries.

Conclusion
Given the economics of ransomware – high reward for low risk – and the ready availability of
source code from leaks like Babuk, it’s inevitable that the proliferation of new ransomware
groups we’re seeing now is only going to continue. Rook may be here today and gone
tomorrow, or it could stick around until the actors behind it decide they’ve had enough (or
made enough), but what is certain is that Rook won’t be the last malware we see feeding off
the leaked Babuk code.

16/17

Add that to the incentive provided by recent vulnerabilities such as log4j2 that can allow
initial access without great technical skill, and enterprise security teams have a recipe for a
busy year ahead. Prevention is critical, along with well-documented and tested DRP and
BCP procedures. All SentinelOne customers are protected from Rook ransomware.
