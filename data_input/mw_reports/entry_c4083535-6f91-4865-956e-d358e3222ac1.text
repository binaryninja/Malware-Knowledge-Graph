The malware Dridex: origins and uses

1 The malware Dridex
1.1 Changes in functionality since 2014
1.1.1 Functionality
Surfacing in June 2014, Dridex is the ﬁfth variant of the banking trojan Bugat, active between 2010 and 2013 [1],
enhanced with features speciﬁc to GameOverZeuS (GoZ) [2], which was active until 2014.
Its primary functionality is as a stealer, i.e. to steal online banking access codes1 , and enable threat actors to make
fraudulent transfers from the compromised bank accounts. To that end, Dridex deploys at least three methods [3] :
• · Injection of an HTML script into the legitimate webpages of online banks that have previously been compromised, which displays malicious forms to customers asking them to provide their access codes;
• · Redirection towards a malicious page masquerading as the bank2 ;
• · Interception of the server response from the bank’s website and relay towards the threat actors’ PHP server,
which injects the code there.

1.1.2 Modularity
Dridex is made up of several modules, including:
• A loader, tasked with:
– downloading a list of peers3 ;
– initial recognition within the information system (IS);
– installing the payload;
– downloading the additional modules.
• · A payload (also known as the core module, which contains the integrated functions and to which other
modules may be added in order to expand its functionality.
The main functions integrated within Dridex’s core module are as follows:
• A keylogger, which provides the threat actors with context about the victim (screenshots, keyboard input, etc.);
• Harvesting information and tampering with content on websites (web injection), via interaction with the
Internet browsers. According to Bromium [4], Dridex is believed to have at least ﬁve Web injection4 techniques.
This functionality can primarily be extended by the following modules:
• VNC: this module supplies Virtual Network Computing (VNC)5 support for the threat actor’s remote access to
the victim’s workstation;
• SOCKS: this gives Dridex a SOCKS proxy support6 ;
• Pony: based on the Pony malware7 , this can steal access codes;
1 As well as personal data and account balances.
2 Technique previously leveraged by and most likely borrowed from the trojan Dyre.
3 In the context of Dridex peer-to-peer pseudo-network operations.
4 DLL order hijacking, process hollowing, PE injection, thread execution hijacking and AtomBombing.
5 System for viewing and controlling the desktop environment of a remote computer, using the RFB protocol for communications.
6 The network protocol Secured over credential based kerberos (SOCKS) enables a program to use the services of a ﬁrewall during an exchange

with an external server
7 Malware and controller of the botnet active since 2011, specialising in the theft of access codes and crypto-assets, but also in the distribution

of malware, v1.9 of which leaked at the end of 2012 [5]. Pony has distributed such malware as GoZ, Necurs, Dyre, Vawtrak, Cryptolock and
Cribit. In 2013, there were several Pony botnets.

• Kill OS: deployed across systems identiﬁed as belonging to researchers or automated malware analysis systems,
it erases the master boot record (MBR) from the hard drive in a bid to sabotage the infected workstation;
• Spammer: this is harnessed to send spam emails;
• Email stealer: this is run to harvest the victim’s emails.

Fig. 1.1 : General composition

1.1.3 Development
Dridex is constantly being upgraded. Since 2014, its developers have added regular updates and patches. For example:
• In November 2014, Dridex embraced not only digital signature theft but also the P2P protocol [6].
• Dridex is the ﬁrst known malware to have implemented, in February 2017, a new code injection technique
discovered in October 2016, AtomBombing [4].
• Attack vectors are changing apace. Accordingly, the changeover from Dridex v3 to v4 in early 2017 came
hand-in-hand with addition of the vulnerability 0-day MS Word (CVE-2017-0199)8 [4, 7].

1.2 Botnet use
Dridex employs various Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets9 10 composed of workstations it compromises [9]. Their P2P
architecture has three (layers), which makes the end command and control (C2 backend) machines more difficult to
identify, so bolstering the infrastructure’s resilience.
The C2 backend, otherwise known as the root infrastructure, contains the database and management logic of the
botnet. It comprises around 24 servers [10]. It transmits new updates of the Pony, Kill OS, Spammer and Email Stealer modules to the nodes. The C2 frontends (admin node), which operate like reverse proxies, and comprise around 15
servers [10], communicate with the nodes, of which there are believed to be several hundred. These are composed
of infected systems (bots) and represent the ﬁrst communication layer in which the rest of the infected systems are
in contact. They communicate together to maintain the network, extend it, distribute the VNC and SOCKS modules
and transfer queries to the C2 frontends.

8 Vulnerability enabling the concealment of malicious instructions in a document saved in .RTF format.
9 For a clearer grasp of the notion of botnet, an assessment of the threat botnets pose can be found on the CERT-FR website [8].
10 In botnets using this architecture, zombie machines do not communicate directly with the C2 infrastructure, but with other zombie machines

deﬁned in an updatable list of peers. As such, only a small number of machines are in contact with the C2 infrastructure run directly by the
threat actor. These machines then relay the information transmitted by the C2 to the other infected machines featuring in their list, which
will do the same.

Fig. 1.2 : How the botnet Dridex works
Each bot (peer) can be identiﬁed within the P2P network via two IDs it generates: the bot ID identiﬁes the infected
user on a computer and the computer ID identiﬁes the latter. In this way, multiple infections on the same computer can be detected. Moreover, each bot keeps a list of other peers, i.e. IP addresses and port numbers. In order to
ensure this list remains active, the peers ask the nodes for updates at regular intervals.
Dridex’ maximum infection rate is considered to have been reached over the 2015-2016 period. In 2015, the main
countries to be targeted by Dridex were the UK, Italy and France, which had 1,804 bots. The United States was the
next most common target [11].

1.3 Afﬁliate model
While some banking trojans are sold alone and deployed by the customer, Dridex operates according to an affiliate
model. Each affiliate has access to a subset of bots [12], while the group Evil Corp controls the C2 backends of the
different Dridex botnets.
According to the Western District of Pennsylvania Court indictment against members of Evil Corp, the affiliates
apparently purchase Dridex use from the group (e.g. for USD 100,000 in the case of one British mule11 who became
an affiliate), then funnel half of the proﬁts along with USD 50,000 per week to the group so as to retain the privilege
of being able to use it. In return, Evil Corp is said to provide technical support [10].
The affiliates are distinguished by:
• their botnet ID, i.e. the number attributed to the Dridex version associated with the subset of bots they
manage. With these botnet IDs, the activity of each of the affiliates can be distinguished and different botnet
IDs can be associated with the same operator [13]. For example, in 2015 Dridex had nine botnets supporting

11 Individual who transfers illegally acquired funds via different bank accounts in different countries.

its ecosystem, the three most active being botnets 12012 , 20013 and 22014 ;
• their targets, both in terms of sector and geography: for example, in 2015, the primary target of botnet ID 120
was banks, and France was particularly targeted by botnets 220, 120, 302, 125, 322, 225 and 228 in 2016 and
botnet 1011 in 2019 [9, 15] ;
• the chosen infection vector.

2 Dridex' developers: Evil Corp
The names given in this chapter come from open sources and judicial documents that have been systematically referenced.

2.1 The group’s origins: ZeuS, JabberZeuS and GameOverZeuS
In 2005-2006 or thereabouts, M. Bogachev (alias Slavik, lucky12345) created the trojan ZeuS (alias Zbot) (see Appendix 6.1). ZeuS was hired out as malware-as-a-service to other cybercriminal groups [16].
In early 2009, M. Bogachev began working with the cybercriminal group named ”Business Club”, allegedly led by
M. Yakubets (alias Aqua) [17]. The group is thought to have called on Bogachev to collaborate on developing an
enhanced version of Zeus capable of routing information to the threat actors on the compromised bank accounts,
and particularly of notifying them when a victim signs in to their online bank account [18]. This version, enhanced
by use of the XMPP (Extensible messaging and presence protocol) protocol, commonly dubbed Jabber [19], would be
renamed JabberZeuS (see Appendix 6.2).
At the end of 2010, M. Bogachev claimed he was retiring, after reaping nearly USD 100m worth of proﬁts during
his ﬁve years in operation [20]. The FBI nevertheless published an indictment against M. Bogachev in June 2014,
which would suggest that he continued his malicious operations.
In May 2011, Zeus’ source code went public. To date, 447 variants of Zeus, associated with 27 families, have been
identiﬁed [21].
In September 2011, a variant of ZeuS, Murofet (alias Licat), emerged, allegedly becoming the leading tool leveraged
by members of the Business Club [17], and was soon after renamed GameOverZeuS (GoZ) (see Appendix ??). In
2012, the botnet GoZ also distributed the ransomeware Cryptolocker.
In May 2014, the FBI-led Operation Tovar, supported by the Russian police [20], took down the infrastructure of
GoZ and Cryptolocker, as well as the P2P network of the GoZ botnet. At the time, this included some 1 million
bots, and was responsible for fraudulent transactions totalling tens of millions of dollars [18].

2.2 Evil Corp
2.2.1 2014: from JabberZeuS to Evil Corp
The banking trojan Dridex ﬁrst appeared on the scene in June 201415 . Dridex is v5 of the malware Bugat, which
surfaced in 2010, and is manifestly operated (perhaps even developed) by at least one member of the Business Club,
Yakubets and Ghinkul, one of the operators of Troyak, the bulletproof hosting provider16 (taken down in 2010) of
Business Club [18].
A. Ghinkul (alias Smilex) [10], a Moldovan national, was arrested in August 2015 in Cyprus and extradited to the US
[22], after Dell SecureWorks experts redirected the control points of the botnet Dridex towards a sinkhole17 server,
enabling the FBI to dismantle the associated infrastructure and pick him out from among 14 Dridex distributors.
Ghinkul most likely belonged to the team administrating botnet ID 120.

15 Two weeks after GOZ was taken down, the banking trojan Dyre also allegedly appeared. In addition to having the same developer as Gozi

Neverquest, some attacks involving Dyre could be connected to the Business Club. It is quite possible, then, that the group branched out,
harnessing Dyre to steal money from large business banking accounts, and Dridex to steal money from retail banking accounts. In November
2015, the arrest of Dyre’s operators led to it becoming completely inactive [18].
16 On the black market, criminals offer servers for hire that are remote from any jurisdiction. These are called bulletproof servers. Once hired
out, a command centre can be installed in the server.
17 Sinkholing involves redirecting data ﬂow from zombie machines to a server outside the control of malicious operators.

Comment: it is interesting to note that, following Ghinkul’s arrest, botnet ID 120 was not the only one to become temporarily inactive: botnet 220 associated with TA505 only resumed operations three months afterwards.
Despite this arrest, the Business Club, henceforth known as Evil Corporation (alias EvilCorp, Indrik Spider), headed
up by Yakubets, has renewed its infrastructure and remained active.

Fig. 2.1 : Mapping of links between Russian-speaking cybercriminal groups, from ZeuS to Evil Corp
In a joint indictment dated 5 December 2019, the US Department of Justice and Britain’s National Crime Agency
identiﬁed nine members of the group Evil Corp. In addition to M. Yakubets:
• I. Turashev allegedly acted as administrator of the malware Dridex and lent technical assistance to its operators;
• D. Gusev is accused of having materially and ﬁnancially facilitated Evil Corp, with six Russian-based companies
for which he was the General Director receiving sanctions on the part of the US Treasury [23] ;

• The six main remaining members of Evil Corp18 have particularly been identiﬁed through posts on social
media [24], most ﬂaunting lavish spending sprees including luxury cars with “BOP” in the number plate
(pronounced “VOR”, which means “thief” in Russian).
In addition to Dridex, Blueliv alleges that Evil Corp has also distributed other trojans including (POS malware) [25],
as well as Carbanak19 [26]. Evil Corp is most likely made up of two operational teams, each with spammers, i.e.
individuals specialising in the distribution of phishing campaigns not only on behalf of Evil Corp but also other
threat actor groups [27].

2.2.2 Evil Corp's development since 2017
The ransomware BitPaymer
Discovered in July 2017 [28], the ransomware Bitpaymer (alias FriedEx) ﬁrst hit the headlines following its attack
against Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), at a Scottish hospital, in August 2017.
Bitpaymer is a binary ﬁle, which means it cannot be distributed or log in to a C2 server of its own accord. Its operators therefore execute it manually. It has many code similarities with Dridex [28]. Moreover, a lot of attacks leading
to encryption by the ransomware Bitpaymer have involved prior compromising by Dridex. Such connections suggest that Bitpaymer has been developed and operated by Evil Corp.
Bitpaymer represents a change in tactics on the part of Evil Corp, with precedence now given to a small number
of highly proﬁtable targeted attacks (Big Game Hunting) rather than its massive Dridex schemes run since 2014. In
2019, it appears that Evil Corp is now using Dridex no longer to commit bank fraud but to conduct recce operations
on the ISs it compromises so as to determine whether or not it is worth distributing Bibpaymer on them [25].
Bitpaymer’s typical infection chain involving Dridex is as follows:

Fig. 2.2 : Bitpaymer’s infection chain involving Dridex
That said, Bitpaymer can also apparently be distributed by Emotet rather than Dridex (which is itself sometimes
distributed by Emotet) [29, 30].

18 Dmitry Smirnov, Artyom Yakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitsky, Dmitry Slobodskoy and Kirill Slobodskoy.
19 In 2016, there are even reports that Carbanak was sometimes downloaded by Dridex loader within infected ISs.

The malware Dridex: origins and uses

The indictment against Yakubets and other members of Evil Corp, published in early December 2019, does not
seem to have dented the cybercriminal group’s activities much, given the ongoing BitPaymer campaigns.

Split within Evil Corp
In April 2019, Evil Corp is thought to have split into two groups: Indrik Spider and Doppel Spider20 [31]. While
Indrik Spider allegedly ran the malware Dridex and Bitpaymer, as had been done since 2018, Doppel Spider purportedly executed a modiﬁed version of Dridex, DoppelDridex, as well as a variant of the ransomware BitPaymer,
DoppelPaymer. In this way, it not only deployed banking fraud campaigns via DoppelDridex only, but also ransomware campaigns via DoppelPaymer.
Given that:
• the malware FakeUpdates distributed Dridex in October 2019, and that Dridex deployed either BitPaymer or
DoppelPaymer within the victims’ ISs [32],
• during a DoppelPaymer incident, FireEye detected the downloading of Dridex v4 botnet ID 501 (associated
with Evil Corp), then of Dridex v2 botnet ID 12333 in a bid to deploy DoppelPaymer (associated with Doppel
Spider) [32] ;
• Doppel Spider uses the services of Emotet [31], as does Evil Corp,
It would appear that the two groups are continuing to collaborate, or perhaps even that Doppel Spider is a subgroup of Evil Corp.
PHowever, since the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, what distinguishes the operators behind DoppelPaymer from Bitpaymer’s
operators is that the former have started to publish the data exﬁltrated from the IS of their victims (on the website
www.doppleshare[.]top/), in the same way as operators of other ransomware (Maze, Sodinokibi, Clop and Nemty
in particular) [33].

20 Indrik Spider and Doppel Spider are two alias established by Crowdstrike.

3 Distribution of Dridex by the main afﬁliates
The infection vector comes across as the most discriminating characteristic of the different botnet IDs, and therefore
of the different affiliates. That said, there is a risk of confusing the affiliate and the distributor chosen by the latter.
For example, the operator of a botnet distributing the Dridex of a speciﬁc botnet ID must not be confused with the
affiliate of the botnet ID in question.

3.1 Phishing emails
3.1.1 The botnet CraP2P (alias Necurs)
Active from 2012 to 2020, CraP2P is a botnet specialising in the distribution of phishing campaigns and malware,
on behalf of various threat actor groups. Over this time, the number of bots making it up has risen to nine million.
Any one of these bots was capable of sending out several million spam emails in the space of a few dozen days [34].
CraP2P was, for example, used by its operators to distribute GoZ in 2013, Cryptolocker in 2014 and Dridex from at
least 2015 [35].
Over the 2015-2016 period, CraP2P was behind phishing campaigns particularly delivering Dridex botnets, ID 120,
122, 123, 220, 223 and 301. Whereas botnet ID 120 was associated with A. Ghinkhul until the middle of 2015, botnets 220 and 223 have been associated with TA505 [36].
According to Proofpoint [37], the cybercriminal group TA505 began using Dridex in July 2014, so a month after it
was designed (June 2014). TA505 made fairly intermittent use of Dridex until June 2016 then completely stopped
using it in June 2017. The botnet IDs used by TA505 between 2014 and 2015 to deploy Dridex are most likely 125,
220 (targeting the UK, France and Australia) and 223 (targeting Germany and Austria). TA505 reportedly then used
botnets, ID 7200 and 7500 (probably in 2017).
Comment: Because TA505 used one of the three most active botnet IDs of the Dridex network (ID 220), it could have been
confused with Evil Corp, whereas it was ultimately no more than a particularly engaged affiliate of the P2P network, and
therefore, in effect, in close collaboration with Evil Corp.
It thus appears that the operators of CraP2P were working closely with Evil Corp and some of its affiliates in terms
of distribution, which resulted from past collaboration with GoZ.
Comment: Some sources indicate that Evil Corp could be the operator of the CraP2P botnet, while others claim that this
could be TA505. Without further evidence, it is only possible to conﬁrm a close relationship between these different groups.

3.1.2 The botnet Cutwail
TA544 (alias Narwhal Spider) is a cybercriminal service provider believed to make the botnet Cutwail available for
hire on Russian-speaking underground forums21 [38].
Over the period it was active, GoZ rented access to part of the infrastructure of the botnet Cutwail to distribute
phishing emails [39]. Its supposed successor, Evil Corp, is also thought to have called on the services of TA544 [40].
In 2019, the botnet Cutwail was distributing Dridex ID 1044 via phishing campaigns [41], primarily targeted at the
United States, Canada and Australia. At least once in November 2019, the infection chain purportedly did not stop
at Dridex, since the latter propagated the ransomware Hermès 22 [15].
Comment: It is not easy to tell whether TA544 is an affiliate of Dridex, or whether part of the botnet it operates is used by
Evil Corp or one of its affiliates to distribute Dridex, making TA544 a distributor only.
21 Botnet founded in 2007: GameOver ZeuS was apparently a customer in 2012.
22 Used by Lazarus during the attack against the Far Eastern International Bank, Hermès is a ransomware that can be purchased on the Dark

Web.

3.1.3 The botnet Andromeda
Before it was taken down in 2017, the botnet Andromeda (alias Gamarue) was tasked with distributing Dridex,
particularly with the UK as a target in 2016 [13].

3.2 As a second payload
By Trend Micro’s reckoning, the operators of Emotet, Gozi ISFB (alias Ursnif)23 and Dridex likely share the same
PE24 loader25 , provider, and perhaps even exchange resources [29].
Emotet26 has been able to propagate Dridex since at least 2017 [43]. Emotet has even been known to distribute
Bitpaymer, the ransomware exclusively used by Evil Corp. The ﬁrst connections between Emotet and the operators
of Dridex, Evil Corp, were found in April 2017 [44].
Comment: Evil Corp appears to call on the operators of Emotet (Mummy Spider, Mealybug, TA542) to deliver Dridex as
a second payload within the IS that they have already compromised. The operators of TrickBot (Wizard Spider) have the
same modus operandi.
Regarding Gozi ISFB, TA551 (alias Shathak) used its loader RM3[45] to distribute Dridex botnets, ID 301, 302, 303,
3101 and 35001, in 2018 and 2019 [15, 46] across the US, Canada and Italy. During these same infection chains, Gozi
v2 RM3 has sometimes been accompanied by the credential-stealing malware Predator the Thief 27 or ransomware
GandCrab (occurrences in December 2018)28 .

23 The original banking trojan horse Gozi was developed in 2006 as a competitor of the trojan horse ZeuS. The source code for Gozi leaked in

2010 and was co-opted by other cybercriminal groups to create other trojans, including Gozi ISFB, Vawtrak (Neverquest) and GozNim, a
combination of Gozi IFSB and Nymain [16]. Version 2.13.24.1 of Gozi ISFB leaked in February 2015.
24 Format of executable ﬁles and libraries on Windows operating systems, including .EXE (for programs) and .DLL (for libraries).
25 The PE loader enables Windows to perform the instructions of a PE ﬁle.
26 Banking trojan horse that surfaced in 2014, and became a loader of such malware families as TrickBot, Gootkit and IcedID from 2017. The
operators of Emotet allow other cybercriminal groups to rent access to the workstations they have infected [42, 29].
27 Malware sold on the Dark Web in June 2018.
28 GandCrab may well have also been deployed at the end of 2018 during infection chains involving Dridex botnet ID 10202 and TA547, identiﬁed
by Proofpoint as the operator of the banking trojan Danabot [47].

3.3 Watering hole
Since 2019, Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 and 501, are thought to be distributed via FakeUpdates (alias SocGholish)29 .
Watering hole attacks, or phishing emails pointing to a malicious URL, entail the display of a false browser update
where the malware FakeUpdates would be installed followed by the propagation of Dridex and BitPaymer or DoppelPaymer [32]. Spanish IT service provider Everis System fell victim to one of these attacks in November 2019 [25].
In the case of DoppelPaymer, Dridex ID 12333 was reportedly downloaded on the IS after the latter was infected
by Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 or 501.
Comment: Logically, Dridex ID 12333 would thus be associated with Doppel Spider. Such would also be case for Dridex
ID 40300.

29 Dridex botnet ID 11122 was purportedly distributed in the same way in 2018.

These campaigns deliver, in turn, Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 or 501, AZORult, Chthonic30 and NetSupport RAT31 ,
illustrating the fact that Evil Corp calls on the operator of FakeUpdates, in the same way as other cybercriminal
groups, in order to distribute Dridex then BitPaymer.

3.4 Exploit kits
In June 2019, the exploit kit Spelevo32 delivered Dridex, as well as between September and November, concomitantly with the exploit kit Fallout [15], via compromised websites [52].
The exploit kit Fallout is thought to be the favourite infection vector of the affiliate corresponding to the botnet ID
10111, while the botnet ID 30102 tends to use the exploit kit Spelevo.

30 Banking trojan resulting from the trojan ZeusVM, itself a variant of ZeuS, whose builder binary code leaked in June 2015 [48, 49], and itself ba-

sed on the malware Zeus, whose source code leaked in 2011. Chthonic has been designed similar to Dridex with a module-based architecture,
and shares three of its modules (Pony, SOCKS and VNC) [50].
31 Legitimate remote access tool [51].
32 This exploit kit is also known to have distributed the ransomware Maze.

4 Conclusion
The malware Dridex illustrates just how complicated it is to attribute attacks on account of the plethora of interconnected groups inhabiting the Russian-speaking cybercriminal ecosystem (providers, customers, botnet operators,
etc.). Dridex has a manifold background (Bugat, GoZ), operators from myriad groups (Rock Gang, Avalanche, JabberZeuS), just like its affiliates, and is distributed via many different infection vectors, against a wide array of targets
all over the world.
However, the string of indictments that have built up over the past decade against members of Evil Corp has helped
to better pinpoint the group’s activities, connecting individuals to cyberattacks and malware.
Be that as it may, Dridex remains a threat in the hands of Evil Corp, Doppel Spider and their current affiliates in
particular, in the context of more targeted campaigns aimed at spreading ransomware.

Dridex

Since Dridex is likely to download the ransomware BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer as a second payload, it may be
worth focusing detection efforts on these codes in the event Dridex has been identiﬁed on the information system.
Because Dridex is also likely to be distributed as a second payload by malware families FakeUpdates, Emotet, Gozi
ISFB , there may be equal merit in focusing detection efforts on these codes so as to stop the attack in its tracks.

The malware Dridex: origins and uses

6 Appendices
6.1 Appendix 1: Characteristics of the malware package ZeuS
ZeuS serves two key purposes:
• it turns its victims into zombie machines of the botnet bearing the same name;
• it can tell when its victim is signed into a bank’s website and harvests the latter’s account access codes. This
enables its operators to transfer money from the victims’ accounts to the accounts controlled by mules.
Its main functions are as follows [53] :
• targeted information theft: for example, in 2007 ZeuS stole information from the US Department of Transportation (the United States is its number one target [54] ;
• remote access via the VNC protocol;
• program downloading and running33 ;
• deletion of key components for the functioning of the operating system in a bid to destroy the infected machine.
Comment: The trojan Zeus would thus have been capable of sabotaging ISs, in the same way as Dridex through its
module KillOS.

6.2 Appendix 2: JabberZeuS
The Business Club all began with the cybercriminal group Rock Gang, which operated from 2004 to 2008, and
whose members were of Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian and Moldovan nationality [18]. In 2008, lots of Rock Gang’s
members reportedly began to use Avalanche, an extensive global network hosting infrastructure harnessed by different groups of cybercriminals [55]. Among them, some, united within the Business Club, allegedly called on M.
Bogachev to help develop an enhanced version of ZeuS: JabberZeuS.
The new group formed around JabberZeuS includes some ﬁfty individuals, whose privileges stem from their seniority and who work across several activities:
• fraud: to participate in fraud activities, membership fees must be paid and a proﬁt-sharing agreement signed;
• recruitment of mules: some mules were located in two Chinese cities, adjacent to the Russian border, north of
Vladivostok [17]. In September 2010, the network of British JabberZeuS mules was arrested during Operation
Trident breACH34 [18] ;
• technical support;
• provision of services: the group sold access to ZeuS (for USD 3,000 or 4,000 [20], not including modules) and to
other trojans. Accordingly, in October 2010, the FBI, collaborating with its British and Ukrainian counterparts,
dismantled a network of a dozen or so cybercriminals which had leveraged the malware Zeus to target US
bank accounts and siphoned around USD 70m off them [56, 57].
Identiﬁed group members include M. Bogachev, M. Yakubets (particularly in charge of recruiting mules), Y. Penchukov (alias tank), I. Klepikov (alias petr0vich), A. Bron (alias thehead), Y. Kulibaba (alias jonni), Y. Konovalenko
(alias jtk0) and A. Tikonov (alias kusanagi) [58]. The latter is believed to have developed Leprechaun, a system for
automating fraudulent transactions on Internet banking platforms, used by JabberZeuS. This system particularly
33 Function generally used by affiliates of the botnet ZeuS, which also propagated other malware as a second payload in order to ramp up their

earnings.
34 ACH refers to unauthorised fund transfers occurring in bank accounts.

The malware Dridex: origins and uses

makes it possible to alter a victim’s banking transactions in real time [18]. Brian Krebs35 has identiﬁed disagreements within the group between M. Yakubets and M. Bogachev35 [59].

6.3 Appendix 3: GameOverZeuS
The group built a structure of botnets operating in P2P, via GameOverZeuS and modelled on the ZeuS botnet.
This structure had 27 botnets, whose C2 backends were each controlled by a different person or group, operating
alongside other malware. Most of these botnets already existed and simply migrated towards the P2P of GoZ when
it was designed. In this way, GoZ inﬁltrated computers that had already been infected by JabberZeuS [18].
GoZ included an automated fund transfer system, similar to Leprechaun, called The World Bank Center [18].
Not only that, but the threat actor group was a customer of the same bullet proof hoster (Troyak) for server use as
the Rock Gang and operators of Avalanche and Gozi, and rented access to part of the infrastructure of the botnet
Cutwail to distribute phishing emails. They also used the exploit kit BlackHole36 which distributed Pony Loader so
as to install the payload GameOver ZeuS, as well as the kit Dirt Jumper in a bid to launch DDoS attacks on banks’
websites and so create a diversion from their fraudulent transfer operations [39].

6.4 Appendix 4: On the links between Dridex and Cridex
The similarity in names and behaviour between the malware families Dridex and Cridex has long led to the belief
that they could have been designed by the same developers. This does not seem to be the case in reality, however.
On 10 December 2015, the account DridexBOT appeared on the Twitter network [60], most likely registered using
the email address dridex[@]mail.ru created speciﬁcally for the occasion.
Although this account behaves like a bot, its tweets are actually written by one or more individuals as can be
inferred from its many interactions with accounts of users close to the world of cybersecurity, particularly the
blog MalwareTech, which would authenticate the account on 4 April 2016 [61]. Between December 2015 and 14
April 2017, the date of its last tweet, DridexBOT posted 153 messages, frequently aimed at demonstrating the nonexistence of links between its source code and those of the Cridex family (Feodo, Geodo, etc.) [62, 63, 64].

Fig. 6.1 : Tweets by DridexBOT
Finally, it was keen to underline Dridex’ interest for sectors other than banking, not least industrial espionage [65].

35 During a chat, M. Yakubets agreed with these words from one of the members of JabberZeuS about M. Bogachev: ”he, fucker, annoyed the

hell out of everyone, doesn’t want to write bypass of interactives and trojan penetration 35-40%, bitch”.
36 Also used to deploy the variants of ZeuS Bugat, Feodo and Cridex, as well as the banking trojan horses Mebroot and Torpig.
