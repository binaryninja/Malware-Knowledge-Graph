DRAGONFISH DELIVERS NEW FORM OF ELISE
MALWARE TARGETING ASEAN DEFENCE
MINISTERS’ MEETING AND ASSOCIATES

THREAT ANALYSIS

The well-known threat group called DRAGONFISH or Lotus
Blossom are distributing a new form of Elise malware
targeting organizations for espionage purposes. The threat
actors associated with DRAGONFISH have previously
focused their campaigns on targets in Southeast Asia,
specifically those located in countries near the South
China Sea. These attacks have mainly targeted high-profile
government, military and political institutions, but other
victims include those operating in the education and
telecommunication industries. iDefense analysts have
identified a campaign likely to be targeting members of—
or those with affiliation or interest in—the ASEAN Defence
Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM).

This threat analysis provides security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers
with detailed information pertaining to the workings of the Elise malware family and
the indicators of compromise (IoCs) to assist them in their own independent analyses.
This threat analysis will help to inform organizations and support their decision
making on how to better contain or mitigate the threat through monitoring or
blocking.
They may consider using the information to inform hunting activities for systems that
may already have been compromised, or by using the IoCs by adding them to hunting
lists or endpoint detection & response (EDR) solutions as well as to network- and hostbased backlists to detect and deny malware implantation—and command and control
(C2) communication—or whatever mitigations they determine are most appropriate
for their environments.
Given the inherent nature of threat intelligence, it is based on information gathered
and understood at a specific point in time.

THREAT ANALYSIS

TECHNICAL REPORT
DESCRIPTION
iDefense analysts have identified a campaign likely to be targeting members of or
those with affiliation or interest in the ASEAN Defence Minister’s Meeting (ADMM).
iDefense assesses with high confidence that this campaign is associated with the
threat group DRAGONFISH (also known as Lotus Blossom and Spring Dragon).

MALWARE ANALYSIS
Knowledge of DRAGONFISH's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) helps to
better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.
The sample iDefense identified is a malicious Microsoft Corp. Word document (see
Exhibit 1) with the following properties:
•

MD5: f12fc711529b48bcef52c5ca0a52335a

•

THREAT ANALYSIS

Exhibit 1: Decoy Document

The Word document, which includes information on ADMM-Plus members, has a
malicious executable file embedded as an OLE object (see Exhibit 2).
Exhibit 2: Original Source Path

The embedded file named a.b is dropped to the %temp% folder once the Word
document is opened and is executed by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.
The payload is consequently moved to
\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ as a file named NavShExt.dll and the
executable a.b is deleted.
This file NavShExt.dll is a PE32 dynamic-link library (DLL), and the filename suggests
that the malware author intended to disguise the file as a legitimate Symantec Corp.
anti-virus component called the Norton Security Shell Extension Module.
The DLL has the following properties:
•

MD5 Hash: cd36bbd7f949cf017edba0e6aaadf28c

•

Compile Time: 2018-01-12 17:59:58 (Jan. 12, 2018, 5:59 p.m.)

•

Export Function: Setting

THREAT ANALYSIS

The malware performs the following set of actions:
1. Starts iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) in a suspended state
2. Injects NavShExt.dll into the iexplore.exe process and calls the DLL
export Setting function
3. The iexplore.exe process continues to run in the background
4. Creates a mutex named donotbotherme (see Exhibit 3) to avoid having
duplicated executions
5. Creates a file named thumbcache_1CD60.db in
AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\ where the harvested data is
stored
6. Sends data to and downloads files and commands from the designated C2
server
7. Harvests extensive system information from the machine, such as the
following:
•

LAN and WAN IP addresses (for the latter, it uses the free IP address
service ipaddress.com)

•

Proxy information

•

Installed software list

•

Process enumeration via tasklist

•

List of all the files on the user’s desktop

Exhibit 3: Mutex Creation

Based on the currently available intelligence we also believe the malware is capable
of providing the attacker with a remote shell on the host and can completely uninstall
itself.
Execution debug messages are stored in the %temp% folder in a file named
FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp. Example messages include Client Start!, indicating a

THREAT ANALYSIS

successful infection, or an error message such as [2018-1-25 13:35:22] Try All Addr
Failed! Sleep For: 10.100000 Minutes!, indicating that the C2 sever cannot be reached
and the malware will sleep for a fixed amount of time.
Logs are encrypted using the following static AES key:
Ss)4:WKsRr(3/VJrQq&2.UIqPp%1-THp.
Of particular interest is an embedded, custom application in a .data section that is
responsible for loading and executing executables and DLLs from inside the main
binary. The application supports the following command-line options:
•

runexe 1.exe /c command…

•

rundll 1.dll, DllMain

When attempting to find more information about this application, iDefense
discovered a file with the MD5 hash cfa7954722d4277d26e96edc3289a4ce, which
features the same application and was mentioned in a 2015 report titled Operation
Lotus Blossom by the Unit42 team at partner organization Palo Alto Networks.
Several observations detailed in this report on Elise variant C align with the findings
disclosed above:
•

Similar targeting of Southeast Asia

•

Same export function name in the dropper DLL: Setting

•

Identical custom application to load and execute EXEs or DLLs

•

Heavy anti-virtual-machine features

•

Similar obfuscation techniques used to exfiltrate data to C2 server (using
base64-encoded cookie values)

In contrast to the earlier campaigns, debug paths are completely stripped.
Persistence is achieved using the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD:
•

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\IAStorD

As mentioned earlier, two hidden DLLs can be discovered that are additionally
injected into iexplore.exe and have the export functions named DePatchEntry
or EvilEntry. These DLLs provide additional loading and other anti-analysis
functionalities.
The malware attempts to spoof the host and query non-existing domains, such as the
following:
•

3qyo4o7.7r7i3[.]info

•

dtdf5vu.nt7yq[.]info

•

j.4tc3ldw.g9ml.www0[.]org

•

•

7g91xhp.envuy3[.]net

•

l.hovux.eln9wj7.7gpj[.]org

•

w.7sytdjc.wroi.cxy[.]com

This is likely done to throw off malware analysts or network administrators. The real
C2 server, 103.236.150[.]14, is actually hardcoded (see Exhibit 4).

THREAT ANALYSIS

MITIGATION
To mitigate the threat of the described campaign, security teams can consider
blocking access to the C2 server 103.236.150[.]14 and, where applicable, ensure that
the Microsoft Security Update KB2553204 is installed in order to patch the CVE-201711882 vulnerability.
For threat hunting, iDefense also suggests that analysts to look for the following
artifacts:
•

A value named IAStorD in the autorun key

•

A file named FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp

•

A mutex handle named donotbotherme

•

thumbcache_1CD60.db in AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\
