Readers of this blog will know that our investigations into APT3 and APT10 started with wellknown intrusions and ended with the identities of the perpetrators and the identification of a
front company connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).
As we pointed out on Twitter in December, there seems to be a pattern developing – a
regional office of the MSS creates a company, hires a team of hackers and attacks Western
targets. Why the MSS insists on using sloppy contracted hackers is beyond us here at
Intrusion Truth, but the pattern is undeniable.
What isn’t clear is how widespread it is. As we asked in December, what if all regional
offices of the MSS have their own APT? Could the trail of crumbs be followed in reverse?
Could we start an investigation with an MSS Cyber Officer and identify the APT they
manage?
Starting with the MSS
We recently received a tip from a friendly source that prefers to remain anonymous, but
whose identity we have independently verified. The source named an individual based in
Jinan, a sprawling city famous for its many natural springs. The source claimed that the
individual worked for the MSS on Cyber issues and might be involved in APT hacking.
This was the perfect opportunity to look for an APT and to test our hypothesis.
