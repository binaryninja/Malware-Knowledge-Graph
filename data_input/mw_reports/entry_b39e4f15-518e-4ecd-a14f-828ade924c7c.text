Summary
A compromised Microsoft Teams account at a partner organization fooled users at a
global financial institution into sharing insider information.
After exfiltrating data via the compromised account, the attacker escalated the attack
by sharing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to members of the group that was
specifically designed to bypass Teams protections.
This attack bypasses both the default and Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
Teams protections but was caught by Avanan.
This is a new methodology that shows how hackers are starting to use different tactics
to target Teams over email.
As Microsoft Teams usage rapidly expands, Avanan analysts expect this type of
malware attack to gain widespread prominence.

New Attack Proves Teams Attacks Are Targeted
When a Microsoft 365 account is compromised, one of the first things hackers check for is if
the person has a Teams account. Hackers consider this a high-value account, given the freeflowing of information and data.
Currently, Avanan secures Microsoft Teams for about 150 of its enterprise customers. Last
week, Avanan's security analysts observed a compromised Teams account and noticed that
hackers are exploiting Teams differently than they do email. Instead of typical spray and
pray tactics, hackers infiltrating Teams accounts are thoughtful and patient, waiting for the
right moment to strike.
Avanan analysts have identified this approach as a harbinger of Teams attacks to come—
and in the case of one large, global financial institution, it was enough to almost bring it to its
knees.
This specific malware attack used Microsoft Teams as a vector to install a remote control
trojan from a compromised Teams account.
A malicious payload was sent via a Teams chat from a compromised partner organization
and was specifically designed to both bypass built-in protections and fool the user into
opening the malicious file.
Though this attack bypassed both EOP and ATP, it was caught and stopped by
Avanan.

The Attack Leveraged Teams to Include a Silent Installer of Remote
Monitoring Software
This attack involves two companies. The Avanan customer is a global financial firm—and
then there's a partner organization that they work with.
3/6

Based on our analysis, an account in the partner organization was compromised for almost
one year, and the hacker listened in on an inter-organizational Teams chat. Over the course
of the year, the malicious actor did not contribute in that group channel. This is the antithesis
of typical spray-and-pray modus operandi when an email account gets compromised.
And then the opportunity for the hacker came. The attacker responded to a team-wide
request for some files with the message:
“some of these were large, so I zipped them. Lmk if you have trouble and I can
resend.”
The file included an easily-obtainable hacked version of desktop-monitoring software,
configured to install silently upon clicking the file. This Remote Access Trojan would have
given the attacker full access to both monitor and control the victim’s desktop.
Had the file reached the user, she would have opened the file and installed the malware with
no local alert or message that anything was wrong.
Because the message included multiple files, including legitimate, pertinent documents, the
recipient would have been none the wiser.

The Trojan Software Was Designed to Bypass Built-in Teams Protections
The RAT was designed to bypass Microsoft malware filters.
Most organizations rely on the default, signature-based protection for Microsoft Teams, but
this firm had also upgraded to the additional Advanced Threat Protection subscriptions. With
the ATP upgrade, files that are shared via Teams may be scanned by sandboxing filters
when they are uploaded to the associated ShareFile/OneDrive directory.

It is clear, though, that the attacker had assumed such defenses, as the Trojan included a
variety of methods to detect both sandboxing tools and Windows desktop protections. (The
sandboxing tools used by Avanan use these methods as indicators of attack.)

When tested against Advanced Threat Protection (both the email and file-share scanning
tools), this Trojan went undetected. Unbeknownst to the attacker, the Avanan system
identified and blocked the malicious file, protecting the user and outing the
compromised account.

This is The New Teams Attack
While attacks that use Microsoft Teams as a vector are currently less common than emailborne attacks, there are some lessons to be learned from Slack-based attacks, which
became ubiquitous in 2019.
Compromising a Teams account is ‘easy’. Attackers are already very adept at
compromising Microsoft 365 accounts using traditional email phishing methods. The
same credentials work for Teams.

5/6

Attacks that use Teams or Slack as a vector are silent and stealthy, designed to
avoid detection. Because of the inherent trust that users grant to Teams or Slack
messages, attackers are very careful about potential discovery. Slack and Teams are
the preferred internal East-West vector for attackers to spread inside the organization.
Malware or phishing URLs are specifically targeted to bypass built-in
protections. Once inside an organization, an attacker (normally) knows what
technology is being used to protect it. An attack that uses Teams as a vector will have
already been tested against Microsoft filters.

This Single Incident is Highly Scalable into a Widespread Campaign
When Slack first became the most commonly used collaboration tool, small attacks found in
isolated organizations soon became widespread.
Microsoft Teams is now, by far, the most-used internal collaboration tool, as usage of the
service grew exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams now has 115 million daily
active users, nearly one hundred million more than the latest Slack usage numbers. As
Teams usage continues to increase, Avanan expects a significant increase in these sorts of
attacks.
Because Teams is used in a variety of organizations that host scores of sensitive information,
there is vast opportunity for data exfiltration. Microsoft announced that 91 of the Fortune’s
100 companies use Teams, including major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and a
number of financial institutions. This type of attack would cause significant damage.
This attack demonstrates that hackers are beginning to understand and better utilize Teams
as a potential attack vector. If Teams campaigns follow the trajectory of Slack-based attacks,
we foresee large-scale Teams-based campaigns in 2021.
