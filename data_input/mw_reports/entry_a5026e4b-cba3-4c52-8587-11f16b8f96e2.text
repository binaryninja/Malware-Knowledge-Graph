IBM X-Force recently released an excellent report on a new banking trojan named IcedID
that is being distributed using computers already infected with Emotet. We took the MD5 of
one of the droppers from the IBM report and extracted the payload. After extracting the
payload from one of the droppers listed in the report, using Intezer Analyze™, we have
found code reuse from another malware named Pony, written about in a report by
Proofpoint.

1/5

Pony is a trojan that was being distributed via the Hancitor downloader, distributed through
Microsoft Word documents. The version of Pony used in the reports is believed to be the
same threat actor as Vawtrak. It was also sold via underground forums until the source code
was leaked online.

(Intezer Analyze ™ report)
Using the dive-in feature with the related Pony samples, we can see the following:

With this information alone, it will be hard to attribute this sample to a certain threat actor
due to the public availability of the source code of Pony.

2/5

Let’s take a look at some of the matching functions.

As we can see here, the function in these two samples is a 1:1 match. The function above
is called GrabOutlook in the Pony source code and is responsible for stealing passwords
from Outlook. (You may notice a difference because the strings appear decrypted in the
sample on the left as it looks like Proofpoint dumped the sample with the strings already
decrypted before uploading to VirusTotal.)

3/5

(GrabOutlook function from Pony 2.0 source code)
More specifically, we can tell the threat actor used code from version 2.0 of Pony because
in the Pony 1.9 source code, we do not see calls to DecipherList which is responsible for
decrypting the strings.

Other shared functions from Pony:
4/5

OutlookExport
OutlookReadPSItemValue
OutlookScanPasswords
OutlookScanProfiles
PocomailScanReg
IncrediMailScanReg
CRC32Update
CommonCryptUnprotectData
MapFile
PonyStrCat
PonyStrCatFreeArg1
DecipherList
UnicodeToAnsiLen
FileExists
StreamUpdateModuleLen
StreamWriteModuleHeader
There may be other functions from Pony, but we can see that the shared code is mostly
related to stealing e-mail credentials.
Time and time again, we see threat actors reusing the same code. If we look at reused
code, it makes it easier to detect malware. Such small code reuse makes it very difficult to
get these kinds of conclusions by manually reverse engineering a file. The ability to
automate the finding of code reuse makes our job as malware analysts easier.
