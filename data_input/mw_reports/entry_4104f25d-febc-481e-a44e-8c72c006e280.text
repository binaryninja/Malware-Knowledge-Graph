The popularity of ransomware threats does not appear to be decreasing. Instead, more and
sophisticated ransomware threats are being deployed. Ragnar Locker is a new data
encryption malware in this style.
Ragnar Locker is ransomware that affects devices running Microsoft Windows operating
systems. It was initially observed towards the end of December 2019 as part of a series of
attacks against compromised networks.
In general, this malware is deployed manually after an initial compromise, network
reconnaissance and pre-deployed tasks on the network. This shows that this is a more
complex operation than most ransomware propagation campaigns.
Before starting the Ragnar Locker ransomware, attackers inject a module capable of
collecting sensitive data from infected machines and upload it to their servers. Next, threat
actors behind the malware notify the victim the files will be released to the public if the
ransom is not paid.

Modus operandi
The next diagram shows how criminals are compromising infrastructures and organizations
using this data encryption malware.

As highlighted in the diagram above, there is a group of steps executed by Ragnar Locker
operators every time an organization or infrastructure is impacted. Digging into the details,
attackers first compromise networks, infrastructures, and organizations using found
vulnerabilities or even through social engineering such as phishing attacks, spear phishing
and BEC attacks.
During the compromise process, reconnaissance, pre-deployment tasks, and data exfiltration
are performed before executing the piece of ransomware (Figure 1 — labels 1 and 2). When
the data exfiltration process is completed, a ransomware deployment is performed manually
(label 3).
Notice that each malware sample is unique, with the specific ransom note hardcoded inside
the malware. The affected group name, the links to the bitcoin wallet, and the links to a dark
web blog are embedded inside the binary as presented below.

When the ransomware starts, it enumerates running processes and stops if some of these
services contain specific strings, such as:

2/16

Vss
sql
memtas
mepocs
sophos
veeam
backup
pulseway
logme
logmein
connectwise
splashtop
Kaseya

Ransomware in this line often disables some services as a way to bypass security
protections and also database and backup systems to increase the impact of the attack.
Also, database and mail services are stopped so that their data can be encrypted during the
infection process.
One of the particularities that spotlight Ragnar Locker is that it is targeting specifically remote
management software often used by managed service providers (MSPs), such as the
popular ConnectWise and Kaseya software.
This data encryption malware infects computers based on their language settings. When first
started, Ragnar Locker checks the configured Windows language preferences. This piece of
malware terminates the process if the setting is configured as one of the former USSR
countries.

After that, Ragnar Locker will begin the encryption process. When encrypting files, it will skip
files in the following folders, file names and extensions.
One of the interesting findings is the “Tor browser” folder.

This detail reveals this malware is also impacting security professionals and everyone that
use this specific web browser to navigate in the dark web. The completed list can be
observed in the following table.

Windows.old
Tor browser
Internet Explorer

Mozilla
Mozilla Firefox

desktop.ini
iconcache.db
ntldr
ntuser.dat
ntuser.dat.log
ntuser.ini
thumbs.db
.sys
.dll
.lnk
.msi
.drv
.exe

Ragnar Locker adds the hardcoded extension “.ragnar_*” appended to the end of the file
name and “*” is replaced by a generated and unique ID. All the available files inside physical
drives are encrypted and, in the end, the notepad.exe process is opened and showing the
ransom note file created on the victim’s system directory, as shown in the diagram below.

Figure 6: Ransom note created on “Public Documents” folder.
In detail, a ransom note file is dropped every folder, not including those observed in Table 2.
The ransom note file starts with the “RGNR_*” prefix, and the ID also used and appended to
the encrypted files.

In order to encrypt the files, the malware gets and decodes the ransom note from
the .keys sections, the public key and some configs.

configs encoded.
This section is decoded in runtime and can be observed below.

When a file is encrypted, the “RAGNAR” file marker is also added to the end of each
encrypted file.

This ransomware is not equipped with a mechanism to detect whether the computer has
already been compromised. A particularity is that if the malware reaches the same device
more than once, it will encrypt the device over and over again. Figure 11 presents this detail,
where the files were encrypted three times by Ragnar Locker.

Ragnar Locker and other mediatic ransomwares use several techniques and commands to
damage the Windows shadow copies. With this process in place, repairing potential data
encryption attacks is harder.

vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
wmic.exe shadowcopy delete

Ragnar blog, ransom page and chat
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) files and images are published on the group blog on the dark web
(Figure 1 — label 4) after a compromise.

Inside the malware is hardcoded a link to a page with a countdown and the process to pay
the ransom.

Prevention measures
We are living in an era where ransomware continues to grow, and the number of attacks has
increased especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no magic solution to prevent
attacks of this nature, however, there is a set of good practices that can be applied in order
to minimize the impact of data encryption attack.
The use of an antivirus is mandatory. This software should be regularly updated
Patch updates regularly and update all the software including operating systems,
network devices, applications, mobile phones and other software if applicable
Maintain a proper backup and restore mechanism and made it mandatory
Regularly test the recovery function of backup and restore procedures and also test the
data integrity of backups
Conduct simulated ransomware preparedness tests. This is a rule of thumb to check
the response of your ecosystem against these kinds of attacks
If you use Microsoft Office, install Microsoft Office viewers and always keep macros
disabled by default
Limit access to mapped drives whenever possible and keep file sharing disabled by
default. In general, ransomware looks into shared drives and encrypts files available on
the network
Don’t enable remote services. The organizations with RDP, VPN, proxies and servers
are to be provided with better IT security standards.
