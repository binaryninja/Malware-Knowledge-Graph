It ain’t over yet till the DDoS Sings

S2W LAB publishes weekly reports of the Ransomware activities that took place at
Dark Web. Report includes summary of victimized firms, Top 5 targeted countries and
industrial sectors, status of dark web forum posts by ransomware operator, etc.

Executive Summary

1/7

The number of victimized firms uploaded on the darkweb ransomware site decreased (-22)
compared to the past week, and the number of ransomware groups remained same.
Industrials sector still positioned at the highest proportion of the industries, but Services
sector seemed to increase rapidly which needs to receive careful attention.
Looking back to our previous story, Avaddon mentioned ‘arsenal to “persuade”’ which turned
out to be a DDoS attack against victimized firms. As Avaddon seems to be attempting a
variety of arsenals to negotiate, victimized firms need to be aware of the secondary attack.

The phrase ‘arsenal to “persuade”’ mentioned by Avaddon in the previous post turns
out to be a DDoS attack against victimized firms.
The size of DDoS is clearly mentioned but the harassment of the victims will intensify in
order to give a huge pressure.
