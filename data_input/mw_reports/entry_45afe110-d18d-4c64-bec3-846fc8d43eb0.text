2021-06-17: updated with information from Twitter user ARC
In this post, we'll look at a campaign, that targeted multiple 3D or digital artists using NFT,
with malware named RedLine. This malware is a so called "infostealer" or "information
stealer" that is capable of extracting sensitive data from your machine (such as wallet
information, credentials, and so on). As a side-note; NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital
tokens tied to assets that can be bought, sold and traded.
This blog post is divided into four parts:
Introduction: provides an overview of what happened
Analysis: analysis of the attack and the malware used
Detection: how to detect and remove the malware (skip to Detection if you just want to
clean this up)
Prevention: how to prevent this from happening again
Conclusion: a brief conclusion and additional thoughts

Introduction
From at least last Thursday, 10th of June 2021, multiple users report on Twitter that they got
hacked after being approached to create new digital art. These users, accomplished digital
artists and publishing their work on NFT marketplaces, were approached either via
Instagram, Twitter DM (message) or directly via email. The attacker has masqueraded
themselves behind multiple personas, often claiming to be from South Korea. A few of the
users that reported the attack:

Be really careful out there I was dumb enough to not overlook this and open their SCR
file and got my metamask swiped from à to Z all my tokens gone. They tried to access
other app but my 2fa blocked them to. I’m an idiot don’t me an idiot like me and secure
your shit. pic.twitter.com/gAins00taH

Really terrible day. My Metamask got hacked and now my @withFND account is
compromised. Opened a scam project proposal with a .scr file and a Microsoft Word
icon. Anyone experience this before? Trying to figure out what to do

WARNING TO ALL ARTISTS
Got a DM from "John Billmate" claiming to be "Responsible for distribution of photo
editor" from @SkylumSoftware
DO NOT OPEN ANY LINKS FROM THIS PERSON. This is a scam, and if you got this
DM, or get a dm in the future, block it. #NFTCommunity #skylum

There are many, many more examples - however, we won't list them here. Of note is Ariel's
tweet, where you can note the presence of a file named
"Rizin_Fight_Federation_Presentation.scr". I'll circle back to that in the next section,
Analysis.

Analysis
After scouring the internet for a while, I was unable to discover any of the files mentioned by
the artists that reported the attack, that is until I stumbled upon Cloudy Night's tweet - their
screenshot included a link to a website "skylumpro.com".

As expected, this is not the legitimate website, but rather a clever copycat of the real Skylum
product website (to note, the real website is: https://skylum.com/luminar-ai-b). After clicking
the "Download Now" button, a file named "SkylumLuminar (NFT Beta).rar" is downloaded,
which you need to unzip with the password "NFT", as we can observe from Cloudy Night's
tweet.
The unzipped content looks as follows:

One of the first things you may notice is the large filesize of the so called beta version. As
you've seen from before in Ariel's tweet, the filesize was 745MB, while this file is a whopping
791MB!
But why is this file so large and why does it matter?
The attacker has appended their original file with a large chunk of overlay data; to put it
simply - a bunch of extra data that does nothing.

3/11

The attacker has increased the filesize this much to try and evade antivirus software
and scanning tools; for example, a well-known service to scan suspicious files,
VirusTotal, only accepts files up to 650MB, while some antivirus scanners may not even
scan a file this large.
While you could upload the original RAR file; the attacker has password-protected it
and VirusTotal will be unable to scan it properly. You could re-package it, but the file
itself may not be scanned.
Having said all that, after removing the excessive overlay, a much more reasonable filesize is
obtained: 175KB. This new file's properties are:
MD5: d93de731781723b3bb43fa806c5da7d1
SHA-1: 1d49e7d163bce8cc6591ea33984796c531893b47
SHA-256:
b9923cdcd07e3e490a729560aa6f7c9b153ac0359cc7fa212c65b08531575a5a
Creation Time: 2021-06-12 20:46:31
VirusTotal results:

7fa212c65b08531575a5a/detection
Of note is the creation or compilation time: this is the date and time the file has originally
been created. While this can be spoofed, I do not believe it is the case here. This time
matches with when the attack appeared. It is however highly likely more files, such as the
one in Ariel's tweet, do the round.
This file will then execute a new file; which is the RedLine infostealer malware. This file has
the following properties:
MD5: b7df882c1b75c753186eec8fcb878932
SHA-1: a04339be16a3b48d06017f44db7e86b3c8982110
SHA-256:

59134432f5993da283faa/detection
Note the creation time is different: set in 2042 - this is obviously faked by the attacker to
reveal when exactly it has been created. However, with the above data, we can assume it
was created in the last 5 days or so.
As mentioned before, once you execute the SkylumLuminarNFTBetaVersion.exe file, you
will be infected with the RedLine infostealer malware. ProofPoint has reported on this
malware first in March 2020: New Redline Password Stealer Malware. This malware has

4/11

many capabilities, including, but not limited to:
Steal username and password from browsers;
Collect extensive system information;
Execute commands, such as downloading and uploading other files, opening links and
so on;
Steal cryptowallet information - both from Chrome extensions as well as typical
wallet.dat files. The extensions targeted are:
YoroiWallet
Tronlink
NiftyWallet
Metamask (refer also to Nicole's tweet)
MathWallet
Coinbase
BinanceChain
BraveWallet
GuardaWallet
EqualWallet
JaxxxLiberty
BitAppWallet
Steal data from other software, such as:
Steam;
Telegram;
FTP clients such as FileZilla.
The screenshot below displays part of RedLine's functionalities:

5/11

RedLine will first gather some basic information about your machine, such as the machine
name, external IP address, your geography and so on. It gathers external information by
querying one of the following IP lookup services:
https://api.ipify.org
https://icanhazip.com
https://wtfismyip.com/text
http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/
http://checkip.dyndns.org
Note these services are not malicious, they are simply being used by the attacker to gather
more information. Interestingly enough, RedLine will use SOAP HTTP (POST) requests to its
command and control server (the server or machine controlled by the attacker where your
data will end up) using the following IP:
185.215.113.60;
On port 59472;
This IP resides in the Seychelles.
Another domain and IP observed is (from ARC's tweet above, the files in that archive were
almost 600MB):
xtfoarinat.xyz;
On IP 92.38.163.189;
This IP also has sinaryaror.xyz resolve to it, another RedLine command and control
server.
6/11

One may also observe connections to tempuri.org. This is a default placeholder for web
services, and is not atypical when using SOAP over HTTP. Tempuri is not malicious.
Finally, after receiving all this data, the attacker can start logging into your accounts, attempt
to steal your tokens, impersonate you and so on. The attacker can also install other malware
if they wish, such as ransomware.

What now? Detection
Good news:
The variant discussed in this blog does not appear to persist: in other words, after a reboot,
its process will not be active anymore, at least for the variant discussed in this blog post.
Bad news:
Everything else - unfortunately, RedLine works pretty fast and a few minutes are enough to
exfiltrate all your data and for the attacker to fully compromise all your accounts.
Luckily for us, RedLine stealer should be detected by most commercial and free antivirus
software products on the market. A few recommendations to get rid of the RedLine variant
discussed in this blog post - note this may not fully cover the variant you encountered:
1. Contact your NFT provider, cryptowallet provider and so on as soon as possible via
telephone call or another computer and inform them of what happened; ask for a
temporary block of your account or to at least temporarily block any funds from now on.
>>> It is very important you do this first! <<<

2. If you can, change yourcredentials from another machine; such as your phone,
your partner's laptop, ... Note it's recommended to change your credentials at least for
your email accounts and for your wallets - focus on the most important accounts first! If
you do not have this possibility, continue with the steps below.

3. Open Task Manager, go to the Details tab and search for any process with the
following names:
1. SkylumLuminarNFTBetaVersion.exe;
Flamingly.exe;
FieldTemplateFactory.exe;
PaintingPromoProject;
Alternatively, the name of the file you executed.

7/11

2. Now, kill the process by right-clicking on it > select End Process (or End Task).

4. If you have a firewall or proxy, block the IPs 185.215.113.60 and 92.38.163.189.

5. Run a scan with your currently installed antivirus and a scan with an alternative
product, for example, Malwarebytes (has a free version);
1. You can also use Eset's Online Scanner (free):
https://www.eset.com/int/home/online-scanner/

6. Enable the Windows Firewall: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turnmicrosoft-defender-firewall-on-or-off-ec0844f7-aebd-0583-67fe-601ecf5d774f
1. While this might not have much impact at this point, it will give you an additional
layer of protection from other threats;

7. Delete all the files you have previously downloaded if they still exist on your system; if
you'd like me to analyse them, you may send me a copy first;

8. If the above scans have turned up:
Clean: have you executed the file?
1. If not, you are not infected.
2. If you did, and the scanners turn up with nothing, it's possible your current
antivirus product has blocked the attack.
3. You might also want to Refresh your PC to have peace of mind.
Not clean (there were detections): let the above product (e.g. Malwarebytes or Eset)
clean them up and reboot your computer.

Finally, reset all (or the rest of) your credentials. Do this only when you know your
machine is clean! Alternatively, reset your credentials from another machine as indicated
earlier.
It's important to follow these steps as soon as possible to prevent any damages.

Prevention
You've come this far, or perhaps you simply skipped to this part - arguably the most
important one: to prevent this attack from happening in the first place. So how can this
be achieved?
1. First and foremost: ensure you are using Windows 8.1 or later. Older Operating
Systems, such as Windows 7, are no longer supported by Microsoft and have
additional vulnerabilities attackers may exploit;

2. Install an antivirus and enable the Windows Firewall. It does not matter if the
antivirus is free or not; paid versions do offer more features, but a free version will do
just as much.
1. Starting from Windows 10, Windows Defender should protect adequately from
attacks such as the one described in this blog post. Other free alternatives are
Kaspersky's free cloud antivirus and Malwarebytes.
2. When you get any file, scan it with your antivirus first! (typically done by rightclicking on the file or folder)
3. When in doubt, upload the file to VirusTotal. Note however the tactics used here:
if there's a really large file, it may not be able to be scanned properly - this can be
an indication of malicious intent!

3. Set UAC (User Account Control) to the maximum level: Always Notify - this will stop
some additional attacks (you will get more prompts; if you do, take a pause and verify
what's on the screen should indeed be executed). Here's how to do that:
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-change-user-account-control-uac-levels/
4. Enable file extensions: some extensions, such as .scr, historically a screensaver file;
are in fact executables - which could contain malicious code, as was the case in Ariel's
tweet. Do not open or run these files. This will also protect you against the "double
extensions" trick. A file named commission.jpg.exe will now be visible as such - if file
extensions are disabled, you would see commission.jpg - see the difference? Here's
how you can enable file extensions:
https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-fileextensions/

5. Create unique passwords where possible; if feasible; use a password manager;

9/11

6. Enable MFA (or 2FA if MFA is not available) on all your sensitive accounts; this will add
an additional layer which is typically very hard for the attacker to guess or crack.
Google "your service/ account + MFA" for specific instructions;

7. If you receive a new commission or request to create art, stop and think first - ask
yourself these questions:
1. Is this coming from a reputable account or from a totally new account?
1. If reputable, can I verify their claim or request somehow?
2. If from a new account: be extra wary!
3. If from an account with very low followers/following: be extra wary!
2. How will they pay me?
1. Are they using a verified cryptowallet, or trying to set me up for something
shady?
2. Do they have any reviews on their (public) profile, if any?
3. What are they asking of me exactly?
1. Are they indeed sending just images, or is there an executable file or
"special software" I am supposed to download/open?
4. Where are their links or attachments leading to?
1. Are these leading to another service, e.g. imgur.com, or something different
altogether?
5. I have downloaded the file(s), but I do not trust the source;
1. Delete it or ask for more information;
2. Block the sender if you are suspect and report their account, delete any
files;
3. You can double-check by scanning the files with your antivirus, or uploading
it to VirusTotal. The same nuance as above applies however.
6. You can also Google any information they send through to further verify their
claims.

8. Finally and where possible;
1. Use a hardware instead of software wallet;
2. Secure your seed phrase; store it offline, for example, on an external drive or use
pen and paper;
3. Verify the security settings in your wallet or crypto provider: perform a check of
which other security features you can enable, and enable them.
Manifold, a company that creates blockchain products for NFT communities, has also written
an excellent post-mortem of this attack which includes additional advice - I highly
recommend you to read it: https://manifoldxyz.substack.com/p/the-fvckrender-hack-postmortem

Conclusion and afterthoughts
It's not the first time a highly targeted or specific attack occurs on communities that use
crypto in some form or another, for example, at the end of 2019, Monero's download site and
binaries were compromised for a brief time.
If you have been targeted by this attack, and you have been compromised, follow the advice
in this blog as soon as possible to clean it up and to prevent any future attack.
This attack was quite specific and targeted - there is really no need to feel bad if you have
been affected, as it can happen to anyone. Explain to your crypto provider what happened,
and they should be able to help you out.
I'd like to thank all the vigilant users on Twitter out there for creating awareness, and I hope
this blog has provided further insight. If you were affected, and you'd like me to analyse any
suspicious file, or would just like to comment, use the comment section below or contact me
on Twitter. Refer to my About me page for even more contact details.
