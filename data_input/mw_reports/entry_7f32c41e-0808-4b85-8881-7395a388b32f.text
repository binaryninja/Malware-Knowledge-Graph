Whether you’ve read up on Greek mythology or you’re simply a big fan of Marvel comics, the
name “Zeus” should be familiar to you. In the context of cybercrime though, ZeuS (aka the
Zbot Trojan) is a once-prolific malware that could easily be described as one of a handful of
information stealers ahead of its time. Collectively, this malware and its variants infected
millions of systems and stole billions of dollars worldwide.
ZeuS was primarily created to be a financial or banking Trojan, otherwise known as
crimeware. But, as you’ll see, the extent of its information stealing ability could easily go
beyond covertly pilfering financial information, making it a real threat to individuals and
organizations of all sizes.
First spotted in-the-wild in 2007, the earliest known version of the ZeuS Trojan was caught
stealing sensitive information from systems owned by the United States Department of
Transformation. It was believed that ZeuS originated in Eastern Europe. ZeuS affiliates
focused their efforts away from corporations and large banks, going after small- to mediumsized organizations, including towns and churches, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI).

ZeuS usually arrives via phishing campaigns, spam campaigns, and drive-by downloads.
However, this is easy to change and anyone motivated to conduct financial fraud can easily
change who they target and how they want their ZeuS to be delivered. Victims have been
infected by ZeuS variants via instant messengers (IM), messaging features in social media
platforms, and even a pay-per-install (PPI) service—a way to distribute ads to users that a
ZeuS user employed for their campaigns.
Once a machine gets infected, ZeuS immediately steals information from web browsers and
Windows’ protected storage (PStore), such as banking or financial information and stored
account credentials, respectively. All stolen data are siphoned off via a command & control
(C&C) server.
Furthermore, any system infected with ZeuS also becomes a bot in a botnet. A kind of illegal
Cloud computing platform that can be rented out to other criminals. These bots were also
used to remotely update the ZeuS variants residing in them.
To date, there are 545 versions of the ZeuS Trojan, according to a website called
ZeuSMuseum.com.

How mighty is the ZeuS Trojan?
A ZeuS Trojan toolkit can be fashioned to do a number of things both for the fledgling and
adept fraudster.
ZeuS lurks inside infected machines as it stealthily monitors the websites users visit. It
recognizes when a user is on a banking website, for example, and then records keystrokes
when the user logs into the site. Because of this, fraudsters can easily log back into that
banking account using the recorded keystrokes.
Some variants of ZeuS also affect mobile devices that run Android, Symbian, and Blackberry.
ZeuS is the first information stealing malware that steals Mobile Transaction Authentication
Numbers (mTANs), a type of two-factor authentication (2FA) method that banks use when
you want to perform transactions. An mTAN, also called SMS TAN code, is usually a 6-digit
number that is unique per transaction and is sent via SMS.
ZeuS steals information in a number of ways, including: Stealing user keystrokes; collecting
the text users enter into web forms; taking screenshots whenever the mouse is clicked; socalled man-in-the-browser (MiTB) attacks that add new elements to web forms asking for
things like social security numbers or bank PINs.

As to what, exactly, ZeuS steals, here is non-exhaustive a list provided by the SecureWorks
security researchers:
Data submitted in HTTP forms
Account credentials stored in the Windows Protected Storage
Client-side X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates
FTP and POP account credentials
HTTP and Flash cookies
ZeuS is also capable of re-encrypting itself every time it infects a system, making each
infection “unique” and therefore harder to detect.
Many researchers attribute ZeuS’s ability to stay under the radar for long periods of time as
the main reason why it became the most sought-after info-stealer kit in the underground
market during its time. It’s likely that ZeuS infected millions of computers, with many victims
not realizing that their sensitive data had fallen into the hands of criminals and that their
computer was part of a botnet.
The ZeuS developers also put a lot of effort into protecting their malware. According to
SecureWorks, ZeuS 1.3.4.x, a privately sold version of the kit, is protected via a hardwarebased licensing system. Also known as hardware-locked licensing, this system allows the kit
to be installed on only one computer.

The “fall” of ZeuS Trojan
In 2011, the source code for ZeuS 2.0.8.9 was leaked. Some groups or individuals started
offering the use of ZeuS botnets on a subscription basis. According to a case study on ZeuS
from students at the University of Cambridge, this “maximises earnings by providing the
same service to multiple users. For the user of the service, the benefits are in a reduction in
the initial financial outlay, while outsourcing the logistical and maintenance requirements, and
reducing the risk of failure to achieve results.”
Cybercriminals also began creating their own ZeuS-based information stealers, make ZeuS
itself something of a footnote. Citadel, GameOver, Panda Banker, Terdot, Floki, and Sphinx
are some of the known ZeuS variants to date.
Before the code leak, it was rumored that the ZeuS creator would be retiring and then selling
his code to a competitor called SpyEye, an up-and-coming information stealer that made
heads turn for being able to remove ZeuS infections. There had been reports of a code
hand-over, yes, further confirming the merging of the two malware, but the ZeuS creator
didn’t quit. According to a report from Brian Krebs, the creator merely stopped selling it
publicly and started creating “a more robust and private version of Zeus” instead.

In 2013, the FBI charged and arrested Aleksander “Harderman” Panin, a 24-year-old
Russian male believed to be the creator of the SpyEye Trojan. That same year, Hamza
Bendelladj, a 24-year-old Algerian male, was arrested and charged for developing
components of SpyEye, operating botnets infected with SpyEye, and of course, fraud
charges.

Is ZeuS dead?
As long as criminals continue to use bits and pieces of its code to create their own malware,
ZeuS can’t be considered dead, so much as fading away slowly. However, ZeuS’s purpose,
data theft, is making a comeback.
Banking trojans haven’t gone away, but in recent years their activity has been eclipsed by an
epidemic of ransomware. Recently though, major ransomware operators have taken to
stealing victims’ data before encrypting it, so they can threaten to leak it.
The tactic has been so successful that some ransomware actors claim to be moving away
from encrypting files, and focussing entirely on finding and exfiltrating sensitive data from
organisations.
In fact, following a devastating attack on Ireland’s public health system, the Conti
ransomware gang issued the Health Service Executive (HSE), a free decryption key to
unlock all of their affected files, convinced that simply publishing and selling the data they
had stolen was leverage enough.
How long I wonder, before information stealers are another thing Biden will be phoning Putin
for?
