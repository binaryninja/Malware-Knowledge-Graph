ESET researchers uncover a new version of Android spyware used by the APT-C-23 threat
group against targets in the Middle East

1/16

We have discovered a previously unreported version of Android spyware used by APT-C23, a threat group also known as Two-tailed Scorpion and mainly targeting the Middle East.
ESET products detect the malware as Android/SpyC23.A.
The APT-C-23 group is known to have used both Windows and Android components in its
operations, with the Android components first described in 2017. In the same year, multiple
analyses of APT-C-23’s mobile malware were published.
Compared to the versions documented in 2017, Android/SpyC23.A has extended spying
functionality, including reading notifications from messaging apps, call recording and screen
recording, and new stealth features, such as dismissing notifications from built-in Android
security apps. One of the ways the spyware is distributed is via a fake Android app store,
using well-known apps as a lure.

Timeline and discovery
The group’s activities were first described by Qihoo 360 Technology in March 2017 under
the name Two-tailed Scorpion. In the same year, Palo Alto Networks, Lookout and Trend
Micro described other versions of the mobile malware, naming them VAMP, FrozenCell and
GnatSpy, respectively. Lookout published an analysis of another version of the malware,
named Desert Scorpion, in April 2018, and at the beginning of 2020, Check Point Research
reported new mobile malware attacks attributed to the APT-C-23 group.
In April 2020, @malwrhunterteam tweeted about a new Android malware sample.
According to the VirusTotal service, no security vendor besides ESET detected the sample
at the time. In cooperation with @malwrhunterteam, we recognized the malware to be part
of the APT-C-23 arsenal.

In June, 2020, @malwrhunterteam tweeted about another little-detected Android malware
sample, which turned out to be connected to the sample from April. A deeper analysis
showed that both the April and June discoveries were both variants of the same new
Android malware used by the APT-C-23 group.
Figure 2 shows the timeline of these events.

investigation

Distribution
Thanks to information from @malwrhunterteam, we identified a fake Android app store used
to distribute the malware. At the time of analysis, the “DigitalApps” store, pictured in Figure
3, contained both malicious and clean items. The non-malicious items would redirect users

to another unofficial Android app store, serving legitimate apps. The malware was hidden in
apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. The latter two of these lures also
downloaded the impersonated apps with full functionality along with the malware. This
mechanism is described in detail in the Functionality section.

Figure 3. The fake app store serving APT-C-23 spyware

Interestingly, the downloads were limited by needing to enter a six-digit coupon code, as
seen in Figure 4. This may be a way to prevent those not targeted by the group from
installing the malware, and hence keep a lower profile. Although we didn’t have a coupon
code, downloading the app wasn’t such a problem – all that was needed was to append
“/download” to the URL.

4/16

This fake app store is likely just one of the distribution methods used by the threat group.
Our telemetry from 2020 showed samples impersonating apps that were not a part of this
fake app store.

ESET telemetry data
According to ESET telemetry and VirusTotal data, Android/SpyC23.A has been in the wild
since May 2019.
In June 2020, ESET systems blocked this spyware on client devices in Israel. The detected
malware samples were disguised as the messaging app “WeMessage”, shown in Figure 5.

5/16

While there is a legitimate messaging app called weMessage on Google Play, as seen in
Figure 6, the malicious app uses entirely different graphics and doesn’t seem to
impersonate the legitimate app other than by appropriating its name. In our research, we
haven’t found another app using the same or similar interface as the malicious WeMessage
app, so it’s possible that the attackers created custom graphics.
We don’t know how this particular version of the spyware was distributed – the malicious
WeMessage app wasn’t offered in the aforementioned fake app store.

Functionality
Based on our research, the malware mainly impersonates messaging apps. The attackers
might have chosen this guise to justify the various permissions requested by the malware.

Installation and permissions
Before installation, Android/SpyC23.A requests a number of invasive permissions, including
taking pictures and videos, recording audio, reading and modifying contacts, and reading
and sending SMS.

7/16

After installation, the malware requests a series of additional, sensitive permissions, using
social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. These additional
permission requests are disguised as security and privacy features:
Under the guise of “Messages Encryption”, the app requests permission to read the
user’s notifications
Under the guise of “Private Messages”, the app requests permission to turn off Play
Protect
Under the guise of “Private Video Chat”, the app requests permission to record the
user’s screen
These steps are shown in the video below.

After the malware is initialized, in most cases, victims are requested to manually install the
legitimate app used as a lure (e.g. Threema), which is stored in the malware’s resources.
While the legitimate app is being installed, the malware hides its presence on the affected
device. This way, the victims end up with a functioning app they intended to download and
spyware silently running in the background. In some cases (e.g. WeMessage,
AndroidUpdate) the downloaded apps did not have any real functionality, and only served
as bait for installing the spyware.
When first launched, the malware starts to communicate with its Command and Control
(C&C) server. It registers the new victim and sends the victim’s device information to the
C&C.

Capabilities
Based on the commands received, Android/SpyC23.A can perform the following actions:
Take pictures
Record audio
Restart Wi-Fi
Exfiltrate call logs
Exfiltrate all SMS messages
Exfiltrate all contacts
Download files to device
Delete files from device
Steal files with particular extensions (pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, txt, text, jpg,
jpeg, png)
Uninstall any app installed on the device
Steal APK installers of apps installed on device
Hide its icon

8/16

Get credit balance of SIM on device (it can get a balance by making a call to three
different cellular operators: Jawwal, Wataniya, Etisalat)
The following features are new in Android/SpyC23.A compared to the previously
documented versions:
Record screen and take screenshots
Record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp
Make a call while creating a black screen overlay activity (to hide call activity)
Read text of notifications from selected messaging and social media apps: WhatsApp,
Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Skype, Messenger, Viber, imo
Dismiss notifications from built-in security apps on some Android devices:
SecurityLogAgent notifications on Samsung devices (package name contains
“securitylogagent”)
Samsung notifications (package name contains “samsung.android”)
MIUI Security notifications on Xiaomi devices (package name contains
“com.miui.securitycenter”)
Phone Manager on Huawei devices (package name contains
“huawei.systemmanager”)
Dismiss its own notifications (an unusual feature, possibly used in case of errors or
warnings displayed by the malware)

C&C communication
Besides spying capabilities, the malware’s C&C communication has also undergone an
update. In older versions, the C&C in use was hardcoded and either available in plain text
or trivially obfuscated, and thus easier to identify. In the updated version, the C&C is well
hidden using various techniques and can be remotely changed by the attacker.
In this section, we will describe how Android/SpyC23.A retrieves its C&C server.
The malware uses a native library with three functions. Two of them return opening and
closing HTML tags for the title and the third one returns an encrypted string.

Figure 7. Returned strings from the native library

The encrypted string serves two purposes: the first part – before the hyphen (“-”) – is used
as part of the password to encrypt files extracted from the affected device. The second part
is first decoded (base64) and then decrypted (AES). The decrypted string might, for
example, suggest a Facebook profile page for the C&C, but it is still obfuscated.

Figure 8. Decrypted but still obfuscated URL

Some of the substrings in this string are replaced based on a simple substitution table and
then the domain part of the apparent URL is replaced.

Figure 9. Decrypted and deobfuscated URL

10/16

From this URL, the malware parses the HTML for its title tag.

Figure 10. Parsing website title to retrieve the C&C server

The last step is to replace the first space with a dash and the second one with a dot. With
that, obtaining the C&C is done. Such a process allows the malware operators to change
their C&C server dynamically.

The malware’s live C&C servers typically pose as websites under maintenance, all using
the same logo, shown in Figure 12.

Conclusion
Our research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and
running new operations. Android/SpyC23.A – the group’s newest spyware version –
features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.
To prevent falling victim to spyware, we advise Android users to only install apps from the
official Google Play Store. In cases where privacy concerns, access issues or other
restrictions prevent users from following this advice, users should take extra care when
downloading apps from unofficial sources. We recommend scrutinizing the app’s developer,
double-checking the permissions requested, and using a trustworthy and up-to-date mobile
security solution.
