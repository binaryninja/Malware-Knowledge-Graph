MirrorBlast and TA505: Examining Similarities in Tactics, Techniques
and Procedures
What is MirrorBlast?
MirrorBlast is a new malware campaign first observed at the end of September 2021. The
malware was named by Proofpoint Emerging Threats Labs, whose signatures recognize the
malware based on its command and control (C2) traffic. Since then, the malware has been
spotted in several campaigns, each showing similar infection chains. The following graphic
shows the rough sequence of a MirrorBlast campaign.

Is MirrorBlast a campaign from TA505?
After MirrorBlast’s emergence, some security researchers speculated that it could be linked
to TA505. Comparing MirrorBlast activity to historical TA505 Get2/SDBBot campaigns
revealed numerous similarities in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). We assess that
these similarities significantly strengthen the hypothesis that MirrorBlast and TA505 are
linked. In this article, we describe some of these similarities:
Similarities in modus operandi
Similar domain registration patterns
Campaign cadence
Similar download websites and lure documents
Similar target selection mechanisms
Follow-up malware

Similarities in Modus Operandi
The Get2/SDBBot campaign TTPs were always similar, as if the group followed a strict
playbook: The domains were registered, the download website was set up, and before the
malware was distributed, the attackers uploaded a legitimate document to the download
website. This was probably for testing purposes. Sometimes it was an empty document or
one containing the characters “123”. But occasionally the attackers uploaded Excel
documents containing several spreadsheets and legitimate content. For example, Figure 2
shows the test document that was uploaded during the Get2/SDBBot campaign on 14
September 2020.
Looking at the MirrorBlast campaigns, the threat actor behaved similarly. The campaign on
14 October 2021 was notable. Like TA505, the attackers registered domains, published the
download website, and uploaded a test document. Strikingly, this test document was the
same document as used by TA505 in a campaign in 2020, demonstrating an overlap in the
attackers’ methods as well as the tools they use.

websites.
Similar Domain Registration Patterns
In Get2/SDBBot campaigns, TA505 registered new domains that had recognizable
characteristics:
3/13

Most domains impersonated well-known online services or used related keywords
The domains often contained one or more hyphen characters to separate words
The domains used the top-level domain .com
Here are some examples of known TA505 domains:
Known TA505 Domains
xbox-en-cnd[.]com
one-drive-storage[.]com
store-in-box[.]com
microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com
clouds-doanload-cnd[.]com
microsoft-sback-server[.]com
one-drive-ms[.]com
owncloud-cdn[.]com
cdn-onedrive-live[.]com
office-en-service[.]com
As you can see, the domains follow a consistent naming convention. Moreover, the
combination of certain domain registrars and DNS service providers is also a good indicator
of new TA505 domains. Figure 3 shows the domain registrars used in the documented
TA505 campaigns from September 2019 to December 2020. Most of the time, Eranet
International Limited was used to register the new domains and only rarely were others used.
But in November and December 2020 this pattern changed when most domains were
registered through Cnobin Information Technology Limited. After that, no more TA505
Get2/SDBBot campaigns ceased, resulting in no temporal overlap with MirrorBlast
campaigns.

4/13

Figure 3 – TA505 domain registrations by registrar, September 2019 to December 2020.
As of October 2021, there are only a few known MirrorBlast domains. However, even the
limited data suggest a consistent pattern in MirrorBlast domain registrations. As with TA505,
the attackers imitate a well-known online service and often delimit keywords in their domains
with hyphens. The threat actor behind the MirrorBlast campaigns used Cnobin Information
Technology Limited to register their domains. This domain registrar was used by TA505 at
the time of their last known activity in late 2020. There is no overlap in DNS service
providers, since TA505 only used DNSPod and Cloudflare.

Figure 4 – MirrorBlast domain registrations.
Campaign Cadence
In 2020, TA505 ran a new campaign almost every day during the week. For this purpose,
new domains were registered for Get2 and SDBBot distribution nearly every campaign. In
addition, the spam waves of the campaigns were large. Comparing the cadence of
MirrorBlast activity is difficult because of the limited data available at this point. However,
comparing MirrorBlast activity to date suggests that the campaigns became more frequent at
the end of September 2021 and currently match the cadence of TA505 campaigns. New
domains are registered almost daily, which are used to spread malware.

2021.
Infrastructure Overlap
In the MirrorBlast campaign on 4 October 2021, an overlap with known TA505 infrastructure
was detected. The IP address 169.239.128[.]11, which pointed to the domain
fidufagios[.]com in the MirrorBlast campaign, was previously used in a TA505 campaign on 9
October 2019. In the MirrorBlast campaign, the IP address was used for command and
control (C2). Meanwhile, in the TA505 campaign, the IP address pointed to the domain
onedrive-sdn[.]com and was used to host a malicious Excel document.

Similar Download Websites and Lure Documents
Another similarity between the two campaigns is the design and use of websites to trick
users into downloading malicious Excel spreadsheets. Both campaigns lead users to a
download website via a hyperlink or an HTML attachment, whose design varies from
campaign to campaign. Figure 6 shows the website of a Get2/SDBBot TA505 campaign from
14 February 2020.

6/13

Figure 6 – Website used in Get2/SDBBot campaign, February 2020.
In the MirrorBlast campaign on 7 October 2021 (Figure 7), the website’s design was almost
identical to the one used in campaigns attributed to TA505. The reuse of the websites
suggests that MirrorBlast and TA505 may be linked, or re-purposed by another threat actor
with access to the website source code.

Figure 7 – Website used in MirrorBlast campaign, October 2021.

7/13

TA505 mostly used Excel documents to distribute Get2 and SDBBot. If you open the
document, you will usually find an image designed to trick the user into activating Microsoft
Office’s macro functionality, which causes a malicious macro to run. These social
engineering images varied in the Get2/SDBBot campaigns orchestrated by TA505.
Examining the images used in MirrorBlast lure documents reveals that they are almost
identical to the TA505 documents (Figures 8 and 9).

Figure 8 – Lure document in TA505 campaign, 19 August 2020.
The only major difference is that the MirrorBlast campaign targeted a German-speaking
region, so the threat actor translated the text into German. However, if you look at the text
closely, you will notice that the second to last sentence was not translated and is identical to
the TA505 campaign. Such images and designs can be copied by other threat actors and
used for their own purposes. For this reason, this similarity only weakly supports the view
that MirrorBlast and TA505 are linked.

Similar Target Selection Mechanisms
The download websites used to distribute Get2, a loader used by TA505, were selective
about which visitors to infect. Namely, they only offered the malicious Excel document to
visitors with a Windows User-Agent. If a user with a different User-Agent finds their way to
the website, they are redirected to Apple’s iOS website.

Figure 10 – Website redirect used in a TA505 campaign.
We found similar target selection behavior when looking at the MirrorBlast download
websites. If you visit the website with a non-Windows User-Agent, you are also redirected to
the Apple iOS website.

This similar behavior is interesting, but also can be used to detect new TA505 and
MirrorBlast domains. For example, urlscan.io, an online URL scanning service, has a search
feature that network defenders can use to find TA505 and MirrorBlast URLs submitted to the
service:
page.url:”*/ios/ios-13*”
page.url:”*/ios/ios-15*”
In the known Get2 campaigns of TA505, a short reconnaissance phase took place after the
initial infection. The computer name, username, Windows version, and a list of active
processes were collected and sent to the C2 via an HTTP POST request. The C2 responded
with a cookie and URLs leading to the next malware stage depending on this information.
This mechanism gives TA505 the ability to select which infected systems to deliver the next
malware stage, thereby minimizing delivery to malware analysis systems and targets of little
value.
MirrorBlast performs similar checks. In the KiXtart phase, which occurs after the Excel macro
code executes, the malware sends various information about the client to a C2 server. This
includes the domain name, computer name and username.

Figure 12 – System information sent to C2 in KiXtart phase.
If this information originates from a client of interest to the attacker, the next malware stage
follows. In the Rebol phase, information about the client is again collected. The computer
name, username and system architecture are transmitted to a C2 via an HTTP GET request.

Figure 13 – Base64 encoded system information sent to C2 in Rebol phase, with a UUID
returned.
In response, the C2 server returns a UUID. This UUID is encoded in Base64 and used as an
argument in subsequent HTTP GET requests. This way, the C2 operator can select which
systems they want to infect.

Figure 14 – Base64 encoded system information sent to C2 in Rebol phase, with no UUID
returned.
Follow-up Malware
Another similarity between TA505 and MirrorBlast is the malware that is eventually delivered
to an infected system. According to public reports, the follow-up malware of a MirrorBlast
campaign is FlawedGrace (GraceWire). FlawedGrace is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that
11/13

was often used by the TA505 group. A report from ANSSI indicates the malware was used
exclusively by TA505 in mid-2020. Assuming that FlawedGrace is only available to TA505,
the appearance of FlawedGrace in MirrorBlast campaigns is strong evidence that MirrorBlast
is closely linked to TA505. However, whether TA505’s exclusive control over FlawedGrace
has extended beyond mid-2020 is unclear.

Conclusion
This article compares the TTPs used in MirrorBlast and TA505’s Get2/SDBBot campaigns.
We focused on similar characteristics between the two. Whether TA505 is behind the
MirrorBlast campaigns or another threat actor is responsible is not definitively clear based on
these similarities, so we leave this for the reader to decide. Regardless of who is behind
MirrorBlast, the campaign uses novel techniques (i.e. the KiXtart and Rebol phases) and has
ramped up its activity in recent weeks. Therefore, we recommend organizations to implement
prevention and detection measures to prevent infection with this malware. To accompany this
article, we have published indicators of compromise (IOCs) of known MirrorBlast campaigns
in the Appendix.
