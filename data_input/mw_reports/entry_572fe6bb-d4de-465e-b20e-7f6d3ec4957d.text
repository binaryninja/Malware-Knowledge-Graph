This paper is part of Carnegie’s ‘Cyber Conflict in the Russia-Ukraine War’ paper series, a
project to better understand the cyber elements of the Russia-Ukraine war. Carnegie experts
each examine a unique dimension of the cyber conflict: Nick Beecroft on international
assistance to Ukraine’s cyber defense; Gavin Wilde on Russia’s unmet expectations; and
Jon Bateman on the overall military impact of Russian cyber operations.

Summary
This paper examines the military effectiveness of Russia’s wartime cyber operations in
Ukraine,1 the reasons why these operations have not had greater strategic impact, and the
lessons applicable to other countries’ military cyber efforts. It builds on previous analyses by
taking a more systematic and detailed approach that incorporates a wider range of publicly
available data.
A major purpose of this paper is to help bridge the divide between cyber-specific and general
military analysis of the Russia-Ukraine war. Most analysis of Russian cyber operations in
Ukraine has been produced by cyber specialists writing for their own field, with limited
integration of non-cyber military sources and concepts. Conversely, leading accounts of the
1/80

war as a whole include virtually no mention of cyber operations.2 To begin filling the gap, this
paper places Russian cyber operations in Ukraine within the larger frame of Moscow’s
military objectives, campaigns, and kinetic activities. Its key points:
Russian cyber “fires” (disruptive or destructive attacks) may have contributed
modestly to Moscow’s initial invasion, but since then they have inflicted
negligible damage on Ukrainian targets. Traditional jamming gave Russian forces a
tactical edge in the battle for Kyiv, and it is plausible—though unconfirmed—that the
cyber disruption of Viasat modems further degraded Ukrainian front-line
communications. Meanwhile, Russia’s large opening salvo of data deletion attacks may
have amplified the general atmosphere of chaos in Ukraine, although the victim
organizations reportedly suffered only limited real-world disruptions. But within the first
several weeks of the war, Russian cyber fires plummeted in number, impact, and
novelty. Cyber fires, although still very high relative to prewar baselines, have barely
registered on the grand scale of Moscow’s military ambitions and high-intensity combat
operations in Ukraine.
Cyber fires have neither added meaningfully to Russia’s kinetic firepower nor
performed special functions distinct from those of kinetic weapons. Rather than
serving in a niche role, many Russian cyber fires have targeted the same categories of
Ukrainian systems also prosecuted by kinetic weapons, such as communications,
electricity, and transportation infrastructure. For almost all these target categories,
kinetic fires seem to have caused multiple orders of magnitude more damage. While
cyber fires potentially offer unique benefits in certain circumstances, these benefits
have not been realized in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Moscow’s military strategists
quickly discarded any aim of reducing physical or collateral damage or creating
reversible effects in Ukraine, and Russia has gained little deniability or geographic
reach from cyber operations. Likewise, Russian cyber fires have not achieved any
systemic effects, and they have arguably been less cost-effective—or at least more
capacity-constrained—than kinetic fires.
Intelligence collection—not fires—has likely been the main focus of Russia’s
wartime cyber operations in Ukraine, yet this too has yielded little military
benefit. Although intelligence processes are more difficult for outsiders to assess than
fires, Russian artillery seems to rely on non-cyber sources of targeting intelligence
(particularly uncrewed aerial vehicles or UAVs), despite earlier claims that Moscow has
used malware to geolocate Ukrainian positions. Russian missile forces may have
received some cyber-derived intelligence, but in the handful of known plausible cases,
this intelligence does not seem to have been valuable for targeting decisions. Even
influence operations, long central to Moscow’s cyber doctrine, have received only
minimal known support from Russian hackers. More generally, Russia’s ham-fisted
overall approach to the war—from its campaign planning to its occupation of seized
territory—suggests that key military decisions are not guided by a rigorous all-source
intelligence process.

While many factors have constrained Moscow’s cyber effectiveness, perhaps the
most important are inadequate Russian cyber capacity, weaknesses in Russia’s
non-cyber institutions, and exceptional defensive efforts by Ukraine and its
partners. To meaningfully influence a war of this scale, cyber operations must be
conducted at a tempo that Russia apparently could sustain for only weeks at most.
Moscow worsened its capacity problem by choosing to maintain or even increase its
global cyber activity against non-Ukrainian targets, and by not fully leveraging cyber
criminals as an auxiliary force against Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir
Putin and his military seem unwilling or unable to plan and wage war in the precise,
intelligence-driven manner that is optimal for cyber operations. Ukraine, for its part, has
benefited from a resilient digital ecosystem, years of prior cybersecurity investments,
and an unprecedented surge of cyber support from the world’s most capable
companies and governments. Given the many factors at play, even if several had been
reversed it might still not have significantly improved the overall military utility of
Russian cyber operations.
As the war continues, Russian intelligence collection probably represents the
greatest ongoing cyber risk to Ukraine. Conceivably, Russian hackers might still
have larger impact if they can collect high-value intelligence that Moscow then
leverages effectively. For example, the hackers might obtain real-time geolocation data
that enable the assassination of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or the timely and
accurate targeting of Ukrainian forces, particularly those with high-value Western
weapons systems; conduct hack-and-leak operations revealing sensitive war
information to the Ukrainian and Western public, such as Ukraine’s combat losses,
internal schisms, or military doubts; or collect valuable information about Kyiv’s
perceptions and intentions that can aid Moscow at future talks, among other scenarios.
Russian cyber fires pose a less serious threat, though such attacks could multiply if
Moscow directs more of its overall cyber capability toward Ukraine (at the cost of other
objectives) or better leverages cyber criminals.
Russia’s war in Ukraine offers lessons for other military cyber commands, but
these must be applied to national circumstances and considered alongside a
range of relevant case studies. Russia’s experience suggests that cyber fires can be
usefully concentrated in a surprise attack or other major salvo, but they risk fading in
relevance during larger, longer wars. Cyber intelligence collection seems to have
greater potential than cyber fires to support a variety of wartime military tasks, but this
probably depends on having competent analysis and decisionmaking processes and a
reasonably precise “way of war.” Militaries with high capability, professionalism, and
readiness in both cyber and kinetic disciplines—such as the United States and Israel—
have previously leveraged cyber operations to enable strikes on high-value targets. Yet
even top-tier militaries seem to have the greatest cyber successes in tightly
circumscribed contexts. It is therefore probably misleading to view cyberspace as a
“fifth domain” of warfare equivalent in stature to land, sea, air, and space.

3/80

Militaries that plan for major war should ask whether they can realistically meet
the high bar of producing and sustaining cyber fires at meaningful levels.
Meeting this bar may require huge standing cyber forces—perhaps many times larger
than what peacetime or “gray zone” conditions require. Alternatively, militaries could
develop surge capacity mechanisms (reserve forces, for example), which are
challenging to implement and risk cannibalizing domestic cybersecurity. The rapid
regeneration of cyber capabilities is another key hurdle. Given limited wartime cyber
capacity, militaries may need to experiment with wave tactics: short bursts of intense
cyber fires followed by periods of stand-down and regeneration. The more infrequent
the waves, the more important it will be to coordinate closely with kinetic fires. If a
cyber command is unlikely to scale dramatically and regenerate rapidly, it should
perhaps not aspire to conduct sustained wartime fires in major conflict. It might instead
prioritize more selective fires in peacetime, gray zone, or prewar conditions, or nonfires activities like cyber defense and intelligence collection.
Countries’ investments in cyber intelligence collection should be matched by
equally dedicated efforts to hone intelligence analysis, military planning, and
strategic decisionmaking. As cyber capabilities proliferate, countries may find
themselves able to collect more information than they can accurately interpret and
effectively use in wartime. In such cases, broad institutional reforms—upgrading
analytic tradecraft, instilling professionalism, or combating corruption—will often have
more value than further technical enhancements of cyber collection. Countries unable
to implement those reforms may learn that exquisite military cyber intelligence
capabilities aren’t worth the effort to build. Cyber units also need to be fully integrated
into all-source intelligence processes that direct them toward information needs which
cannot be readily fulfilled by other means. Wartime use cases for cyber intelligence
might include tracking high-value targets in real time, validating human intelligence in
mission-critical situations, and acquiring very large data caches with durable,
multipurpose value.
Cyber defenders should use the Ukraine war as a reference point to reexamine
and refine prior assumptions about the particular wars they might need to fight.
Their first task is to reconsider the likely ability of prospective enemies to leverage
cyber operations in conflict, given Russia’s humbling experience. They should then
make specific comparisons and contrasts to their own military situation. For example,
China’s cyber forces are probably larger than Russia’s, but they have carried out far
fewer cyber fires. Would they execute an even bigger and more effective cyber salvo at
the outset of a Taiwan invasion, or bungle the opener due to inexperience? Taiwan is
more technologically advanced than Ukraine but its island geography is in some ways
more precarious. Would Taiwan’s communications infrastructure prove more or less
resilient? The political and commercial stakes for Western tech companies could also
be quite different in a China-Taiwan war. Would such firms be equally willing to help,
and could they physically do so without overland access?

This paper’s tentative insights represent one reasonable interpretation of
fragmentary, conflicting, and evolving data. Analysts remain reliant on reports from
the Ukrainian government, allied governments, cybersecurity companies, and
journalists to understand Russia’s cyber operations, their effects, and the larger war in
Ukraine. Yet those sources have only partial knowledge, and parochial concerns
inevitably shape what, when, and how information is shared. Some sources, for
example, have produced fewer public reports in recent months than before. The
resulting “cyber fog of war” continues to shroud even the most closely watched cyber
incidents. A wider fog pervades the war as a whole, which has already undergone
several distinct phases in just nine months—often developing in ways that surprise
Western analysts (and others). Despite this uncertainty, governments around the world
will not wait to incorporate perceived lessons learned into ongoing updates of military
cyber strategies, budgets, doctrines, and plans. Analysts should offer the best
assessments currently possible while acknowledging information gaps and the need to
reassess over time.

How Militarily Effective Have Russia’s Cyber Operations Been in Ukraine?
Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, most Western commentators have
downplayed the role of offensive cyber operations in Moscow’s larger war effort. Analysts
have called Russian cyber operations sparse, unsophisticated, ill-planned, poorly integrated
with activities in other domains, ably defended by Ukraine and its foreign partners, and
ultimately inconsequential when compared to the large-scale death and destruction caused
by physical weapons.
Experts offer competing explanations for how and why Russian cyber operations in Ukraine
have fizzled, but most agree on the core military question: cyber operations have not
significantly advanced Moscow’s campaign objectives. James Lewis, for example, found that
“cyber operations have provided little benefit” to Russia and “failed to advance Russian
goals” in the war.3 Likewise, Nadiya Kostyuk and Aaron Brantly wrote that Russian cyber
attacks “did not have any strategic impact on Ukraine’s warfighting capabilities” and “do not
appear to have impacted the course of the war.”4 The CyberPeace Institute, which maintains
a public database of Russia’s cyber operations against Ukraine, said these weren’t “playing a
major role in . . . tactical advances.”5 Even Microsoft—which has described Russia’s wartime
cyber efforts as voluminous, skillful, militarily innovative, and historically important—has
reported only “limited operational impact” on Ukrainian targets.6 The company concluded
that, “at a broader level, so far [Russian cyber] attacks have failed strategically in disabling
Ukraine’s defenses.”
Not everyone shares this perspective. Prominent dissenters include some Western
government officials who believe outside analysts have underestimated Russia’s wartime
cyber efforts against Ukraine. The dissenting camp describes Russian cyber operations as
sweeping in scale, tactically effective in key moments, and aligned with Moscow’s military
5/80

objectives of disrupting, confusing, and cowing the Ukrainian government, armed forces, and
civilian population. David Cattler and Daniel Black, two serving intelligence officials with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), argued in April that “cyber-operations have been
Russia’s biggest military success to date in the war in Ukraine.”7 Jeremy Fleming, the
director of the UK’s General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), called it “a fallacy to
say that cyber has not been a factor in the war in Ukraine.”8 And Matt Olsen, U.S. assistant
attorney general for national security, said “we are effectively seeing a hot cyber war in
Ukraine carried out by the Russians.”9
Such disagreement stems in part from fragmentary, conflicting, and evolving information
about Russia’s wartime cyber operations. A case in point was the February 24 disruption of
the Viasat satellite communications network by Russian military intelligence—the marquee
cyber event of the war so far. The hack has attracted enormous interest due to its timing (one
hour before Russian troops crossed the border), clear military purpose (to degrade Ukrainian
communications), and international spillover (disrupting connectivity in several European
countries). Yet the Viasat hack’s ultimate military impact has remained murky and contested.
Victor Zhora, a top Ukrainian cyber leader, initially said it caused “a really huge loss in
communications in the very beginning of war,” which was widely understood to mean military
communications specifically.10 But a Ukrainian spokeswoman claimed, and Zhora later
affirmed, there was “no information that [the hack] worsened communications within
Ukraine’s military.”11 This factual confusion has contributed to diametrically opposed expert
assessments of the Viasat hack. Dmitri Alperovitch called it “perhaps the most strategically
impactful cyber operation in wartime history,” while James Lewis said it “ultimately did not
provide military advantage to Russia.”12
Even where analysts share a common set of facts about Russian hacking, they often seem
to apply differing (or unclear) standards to judge military utility. Commentators of all stripes
have framed Russia’s cyber efforts in binary terms: either as a failure or as a success. But
analysts differ in where they set the dividing line between success and failure, causing
people to talk past each other. On one side are cyber skeptics who often emphasize Russian
hackers’ inability to paralyze Ukrainian decisionmaking and critical infrastructure via “shock
and awe” tactics—a high bar indeed. On the other side are cyber proponents who tend to
highlight any signs of coordination between Russian kinetic and cyber operations—no matter
how inconsequential the results. Given these disparate yardsticks and shifting terms of
debate, it isn’t always clear what analysts are arguing about, or whether they disagree at all.
For example, Ciaran Martin expressed early cyber skepticism when he warned that “the
cyber domain may influence the war at the margins, but it will not decide it.”13 Cattler and
Black, both cyber proponents, came to a remarkably similar conclusion: “No single domain of
operations has an independent, decisive effect on the course of war.”14
Methodology

6/80

To advance the debate, this paper divides Russian cyber operations in Ukraine into two
categories, each drawn from military concepts. The first category is cyber “fires.” U.S. military
doctrine defines fires as the “use [of] available weapons and other systems to create a
specific effect on a target.”15 Cyber fires, then, would be those cyber operations intended to
disrupt, destroy, or manipulate data or systems.16 Cyber experts sometimes call these
“effects operations” or “disruptive and destructive cyber attacks.” Here, the term cyber fires is
meant to bring the military context into the foreground, and to invite comparisons (and
contrasts) to kinetic fires.
Many assessments of Russia’s cyber operations in Ukraine have focused primarily—or even
exclusively—on what this paper calls cyber fires. Because of their obvious analogy to kinetic
strikes, disruptive or destructive cyber attacks are often thought of as the major way for cyber
forces to aid military campaigns. But militaries must do much more than carry out attacks,
and cyber operations have other wartime uses. In U.S. doctrine, for example, fires are just
one of seven so-called joint functions—the military tasks “common to joint operations at all
levels of warfare.” The others are command and control, information, intelligence, movement
and maneuver, protection, and sustainment. Although each of these has some applicability in
cyberspace, this paper focuses on intelligence—particularly collection—as the second major
category of interest. Intelligence collection is a well-known role for cyber operations during
peacetime and gray zone conditions, but it has received less attention in the wartime
context.17
Assessing Russia’s cyber operations and their effects on the larger war in Ukraine is no
simple task. Analysts must rely on reports from the Ukrainian government, allied
governments, cybersecurity companies, and journalists. Yet each of these sources has only
partial knowledge of Russian cyber operations, many of which remain hidden. And when
operations are discovered, their effects can be difficult to judge, either individually or
cumulatively. There is little data, for example, on how Russia’s cyber campaigns may have
influenced Ukrainian morale—helping either to grind it down or, alternatively, to fuel backlash
against the invasion. Moreover, the visible effects of a cyber operation do not always indicate
the perpetrator’s true intentions. For example, Russia’s cyber disruption of a
telecommunications network could be a targeted effort to degrade Ukrainian command and
control before a key battle. Or it might be part of broader attempts to isolate and immiserate
the Ukrainian population. Or it may just be an accidental result of a botched intelligence
collection operation.
This paper sidesteps some of these issues by focusing on the actual, rather than intended,
effects of Russian cyber operations. It assumes that many undetected Russian cyber
operations exist but that they aren’t orders of magnitude more effective than known
operations. It also looks for indirect evidence of hidden activity. For example, artillery firing
patterns might reveal whether or not Russian forces have access to real-time, cyber-derived
geolocations of Ukrainian positions. And the paper pairs bottom-up analysis (tactically

7/80

assessing key Russian cyber operations) with top-down analysis (evaluating the totality of
known cyber operations) to discern how cyber activities fit into Moscow’s operational plans
and overall war effort.
Another challenge is that political or commercial considerations inevitably shape what, when,
and how information on Russian cyber operations is shared. The Ukrainian government, for
example, has a strategic imperative to offer a relatively upbeat picture of the war so that
Western partners continue their support and the Ukrainian people maintain their morale. Kyiv
has therefore been reticent to fully disclose casualty figures and other combat losses; the
same could be true of cyber incidents.18 At times, Ukrainian officials have made implausible
assertions of cyber success.19 Meanwhile, Western tech companies have market incentives
to portray their own cybersecurity support to Ukraine as highly successful and strategically
essential. They may also lack the military expertise to place their findings in context.
Microsoft, for example, has been accused of overstating the threat posed by some Russian
cyber operations, as well as those operations’ significance to military history.20 Conversely,
vendors victimized by Russia (like Viasat) may want to downplay the real-world effects to
avoid embarrassment. Western governments and journalists have their own limitations and
parochial interests.
This paper attempts to mitigate source bias in several ways. First, it looks for corroboration
from multiple independent sources, while highlighting when sources conflict or aren’t directly
comparable. Second, the paper places more stock in clearcut factual reports (such as
descriptions of known intrusions) than in sources’ analytic characterizations (like claims that
Russian cyber operation are coordinated with kinetic operations). Third, the paper is
transparent about sourcing so that readers can draw their own conclusions as appropriate.
Ultimately, a “cyber fog of war” continues to shroud even the most closely watched cyber
incidents. A wider fog pervades the war as a whole, which has already undergone several
distinct phases in just nine months—often developing in ways that surprise Western analysts
(and others). Even so, there is merit in working with the best data and methods available to
reduce uncertainty and sharpen understanding. Governments around the world will not wait
to incorporate perceived lessons learned into ongoing updates of military cyber strategies,
budgets, doctrines, and plans. Analysts should offer the best assessments currently possible
while acknowledging information gaps and the need to reassess over time. This paper offers
tentative insights representing one reasonable interpretation of fragmentary, conflicting, and
evolving data.
Fires
Russia’s cyber fires in Ukraine can be categorized in a variety of ways. To understand their
military significance, this section groups cyber fires by the type of Ukrainian system targeted
—and therefore the potential benefit to Russian forces—rather than by technical

8/80

characteristics. (Low-level disruptions, such as web defacements and distributed denial-ofservice attacks, are generally excluded.) Later, this section evaluates the level of
coordination between cyber and kinetic fires and the possibility of cumulative effects.
Against Military Equipment. Moscow’s most tangible military need in Ukraine is to
suppress and overcome Ukrainian combat power, yet there are no publicly known cases of
Russian cyber actors directly disrupting military equipment in the field. Ukraine began the
war largely reliant on Soviet-era military equipment, much of which presumably had limited or
no connectivity.21 As the war progressed, Ukraine acquired a large amount of modern,
foreign-provided weapons and materiel. The U.S. government has long worried that
American military equipment could be subject to wartime cyber attacks by Russia or others.
Ukraine now uses some of this same equipment against Russian forces, providing a realworld test of these once theoretical concerns. Yet there has been a near-absence of credible
claims that Russia has executed successful cyber fires against Ukrainian military systems.
One possible exception: The Economist reported in November that unspecified Ukrainian
military “networks” and/or “kit” had at some point been “penetrated [and] disrupted.”22 It
wasn’t clear whether the affected systems were fielded military hardware—such as weapons,
vehicles, radios, and intelligence platforms—or merely traditional computer networks
operated by the Ukrainian military establishment. Regardless, “the visible effects” were
described as “surprisingly limited.”
Kyiv and its suppliers and allies might try to suppress evidence of any cyber disruptions of
military equipment. According to the Economist, Ukraine has done just that. But if strong
secrecy can be maintained over a long period, that suggests a smaller number of less
consequential incidents. Conversely, Ukraine would probably struggle to conceal a large
number of incidents with significant battlefield impact. Electronic warfare (EW) provides a
case in point. Russia has sometimes used jamming and direction finding to great effect
against Ukraine—for example, degrading Ukraine’s drone capabilities.23 The Ukrainian
government may wish to withhold this information, but researchers and journalists have
nonetheless documented it extensively. These same sources have failed to note any
evidence of disruptive or destructive cyber attacks against Ukrainian military equipment.
Against Communications Networks. Although Ukrainian military hardware has not been
directly impacted by any known Russian cyber operations, the communications systems
used by Ukraine’s military, government, and civilian population have suffered several cyber
disruptions. The most notable episode occurred just one hour before the invasion, when
hackers working for the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation—commonly known as the GRU—perpetrated the so-called Viasat hack.
Viasat is a U.S. company that owns a communications satellite called KA-SAT. It provides
wholesale satellite broadband services to end users, while an Italy-based company called
Skylogic operates and supports the ground infrastructure. According to Viasat, Russian
hackers were able to cause “a partial interruption” of Tooway, “a single consumer-oriented
partition” of Skylogic’s network that provides broadband service to European customers.
9/80

Viasat described the hack as “multifaceted and deliberate.” The GRU cyber actors first
launched a “targeted denial of service attack [that] made it difficult for many modems to
remain online.”24 At the same time, they executed “a ground-based network intrusion . . . to
gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network.” After
moving laterally to reach a sensitive part of the network, the Russians used native software
to issue “destructive commands” to “a large number of residential modems simultaneously.”
These commands “overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the
modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable.”
The incident had widespread impact, disrupting internet service for “several thousand
customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands of other fixed broadband customers
across Europe,” according to Viasat.25 Some equipment was quickly restored, while other
modems reportedly remained offline more than two weeks later, forcing Viasat to ship tens of
thousands of replacements.26 (Starlink terminals, whose satellite connectivity has for the
most part proven resilient, began to arrive in Ukraine four days after the Viasat hack.27)
Though the bulk of the Viasat disruptions occurred outside Ukraine, Moscow’s primary intent
was undoubtedly to degrade Ukrainian communications as Russian troops crossed the
border and missiles began striking targets throughout the country. Ukraine’s military and
police were publicly known to be Viasat customers, and Victor Zhora acknowledged that “of
course, they were targeting the potential of [the] Ukrainian military forces first.”28 However,
the hack’s ultimate military impact continues to be debated.
Zhora initially said the Viasat hack caused “a really huge loss in communications in the very
beginning of war,” which many interpreted to mean military communications specifically.29
But a spokeswoman for Zhora’s agency claimed there was “no information that [the hack]
worsened communications within Ukraine’s military.” Zhora would later specify that Viasat
provided only backup connectivity to the military, and that primary landline networks
remained online during the invasion; therefore, the hack had no military impact.30 However,
on-the-ground sources have painted a different picture of the state of military
communications at the time. Multiple Ukrainian ground commanders who took part in the
initial defense of Kyiv have said that Russia “completely jammed the Ukrainians’
communications and satellite networks” during the war’s opening days and weeks. This
effectively grounded Ukrainian UAVs, cut off normal intelligence channels, and left officers
“without a link to front-line soldiers.”31
These reports cited jamming, not hacking, and didn’t mention Viasat specifically. But Russia
used both methods in concert during its invasion, and they can have complementary effects,
which Ukrainian troops may not have distinguished in the heat of battle. Multiple field studies
have confirmed that Russia’s jamming was quite effective during the assault on Kyiv, at least
initially and despite causing some blowback on Russian forces’ own communications.32
Given the apparent fragility of Ukraine’s front-line communications links, it seems plausible
that the loss of Viasat (whether as a primary communications system or a much-needed
backup) contributed to the serious problems cited by Ukrainian commanders. The
10/80

combination of Moscow’s traditional electronic warfare and the Viasat hack seemed to give
Russian forces an edge in many early engagements. Russia’s ultimate failure to take Kyiv is
irrelevant to this analysis; overall strategic failure does not imply that each tactical line of
effort, taken on its own terms, added nothing to Russian efforts.
The high-profile nature of the Viasat hack has obscured the fact that another major Ukrainian
internet service provider, Triolan, was the victim of a simultaneous cyber attack.33 Little is
known about this event. Triolan was hacked again on March 9, with the attackers reportedly
forcing “key nodes of the network” to perform a factory reset. Both incidents led to significant
service disruptions lasting perhaps one or two days each. Later in March, the state-owned
Ukrtelecom—the country’s largest terrestrial telecommunications provider—suffered what it
described as “a massive hostile cyberattack” by Russia.34 Again, details are elusive;
Ukrtelecom said that it temporarily “restricted the services for most private users and
business customers” in order “to secure the network services for Ukrainian military and
critical infrastructure users.”35 The net result of the cyber attack and the remedial measures
was an 85 percent loss of connectivity, though service was largely restored by the next day.
Kyiv said that military operations were unaffected.
To put these few cyber fires in context, Ukrainians have experienced dozens of significant
internet service disruptions due to physical attacks on telecoms equipment and power
supplies.36 Russian cyber fires thus amount to an occasional and secondary threat to
Ukrainian connectivity. Overall, Ukraine’s telecommunications networks—while somewhat
degraded from prewar baselines—have proven remarkably resilient.37 Key structural factors
include the decentralization of corporate ownership and technical architecture, the agility of
engineers, the industry’s collaborative wartime spirit, prior investments in cybersecurity, and
the availability of supplemental satellite networks like Starlink.38
Against Other Computer Networks. Beyond communications networks, Russian cyber
fires have targeted a broad range of other government and commercial networks in Ukraine.
The most notable incidents have been destructive cyber attacks that delete data and thereby
render systems unable to function, which Victor Zhora described as “the most efficient
scenario to bring impact to data, to infrastructures, to services.”39 Moscow has carried out an
enormous number of these attacks, particularly at the outset of the war. As of late June,
Microsoft had detected “eight distinct malware programs—some wipers and some other
forms of destructive malware—against 48 different Ukrainian agencies and enterprises.”40
The Ukrainian government reported a similar number: in the first four months of war, fifty-six
cyber operations impacted the “availability” of Ukrainian systems (that is, they had
destructive or disruptive effects).41
Although cyber attacks are difficult to meaningfully quantify and compare in a like-for-like
fashion, such figures seem extremely high by any historical standard. For context, the cyber
intelligence firm Talos has highlighted just eight important wiper incidents (all statesponsored) globally from 2012 to 2018.42 Talos’s numbers, although incomplete, are likely
11/80

the right order of magnitude.43 This suggests that Russia has performed an unprecedented
series of destructive cyber attacks against Ukraine—perhaps the largest series of discrete
attacks ever conducted, and possibly more than Moscow had ever carried out, against all
targets, in its entire previous history.44 Citing Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, CrowdStrike called
2022 “the most active year yet for wipers.”45
The remarkable scale of Russia’s cyber fires in Ukraine is further indicated by the large
number of destructive malware variants it deployed. Russia used eight to ten unique families
of destructive malware in the first few months of the war, depending on how these are
counted.46 This is a significant portion of all such malware ever known to exist. Lists of
wipers compiled by researchers have cited anywhere from six to eighteen noteworthy
variants deployed by all actors between 2012 and early 2022.47 NATO’s Cattler and Black
noted that, on February 24 alone, Russia “successfully deployed more destructive malware
. . . than the rest of the world’s cyberpowers combined typically use in a given year.”48
By all measures, Moscow invested extraordinary effort and technical resources to execute
wartime cyber fires against targets such as “Ukrainian government, IT, energy, and financial
organizations.”49 However, there is little public information about the impact of these events.
Yurii Shchyhol, the director of Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, claimed in July that “none of
the cyberattacks that were carried out in the past four months of this invasion has allowed
the enemy to destroy any databases or cause any private data leakage.”50 In contrast,
Microsoft stated that Russia “permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across
dozens of organizations in Ukraine,” which “at times . . . degraded the functions of the
targeted organizations.” Even so, Microsoft said the victims suffered only “limited operational
impact.” Most of the affected organizations have not been disclosed and there are few public
details about how they weathered these incidents.
Moscow’s destructive cyber fires in Ukraine were remarkable not only for their total number,
but also for their massive concentration at the war’s outset and their steep drop-off afterward
(see Figure 1).51 The day before the invasion, hundreds of Ukrainian “systems”—spread
across a smaller number of organizations—were targeted, according to Microsoft. Overall,
twenty-two organizations faced destructive Russian cyber attacks in the first week of the war.
But in the five weeks that followed, Microsoft detected only about three attacks per week on
average. By mid-April the figure would drop to just one attack per week, a level that persisted
through late June. Microsoft noted “little to no wiper activity” in August and September,
followed by a small “spike” in October.

12/80

Data from Mandiant and the CyberPeace Institute show broadly similar patterns using
different methodologies and information sources. Whereas Microsoft tallied the number of
organizations attacked, Mandiant has tracked the number of destructive attacks (a single
attack may affect multiple organizations). Mandiant found five attacks in the war’s first week.
After that, attacks fell to less than one per week, on average, through October. Notably,
Mandiant identified just one attack in the four-month period from June to September, before
Russia resumed its destructive attacks in October. The CyberPeace Institute, which compiles

13/80

public information about cyber operations affecting civilians, also reported a large cluster of
destructive attacks in the first few weeks. It documented no attacks from April through
October.
This story of destructive cyber fires—a huge surge, rapid decline, and long plateau—mirrors
official accounts. One month into the war, Victor Zhora was already saying that “we do not
witness such serious activities as we did at the beginning of the year.”52 In July, Shchyhol
described a monthslong “relative lull in the number and quality of cyberattacks of our
enemy.”53
Meanwhile, the number of novel malware variants dropped alongside the number of attacks.
Microsoft found that Russia debuted four distinct variants in just the first week of the war,
whereas no new variant emerged between early April and late June, the most recent
company data. Mandiant likewise saw a spate of new destructive malware in the war’s first
week, followed by a trickle over the next two months, and then no new malware from May
through October. The decline of new malware does not inherently mean a lessening of
operational effects. But it is one of several signs that Russian cyber forces faced growing
constraints as the war progressed and initial stockpiles of technical resources were
expended. Russian hackers have shifted to more quick-and-dirty methods, according to
Mandiant, leading to more mistakes.54 Zhora said in October that Russian cyber attacks had
become much less sophisticated since April, devolving into “opportunistic behavior” with “no
particular strategy.”55
The military impact of Russia’s individual destructive cyber fires is difficult to judge without
victim-level data. Based on the number of attacks alone and Microsoft’s high-level
characterizations of their results, it is plausible that the early salvo contributed somewhat to
Ukraine’s initial shock and confusion immediately after the invasion. But within several weeks
at most, Russian destructive cyber fires likely receded into the war’s background. To be sure,
even one state-sponsored data deletion attack per week would be remarkable under
peacetime or gray zone circumstances (in any country). But it still seems trivial in the context
of a major war. Russian forces have at times launched hundreds of missiles and thousands
of artillery rounds per week, inflicting large tangible losses on Ukraine’s military forces,
civilian population, and infrastructure.56 There is little reason to think that the dribble of
destructive cyber attacks registers on such a scale. To the extent that Ukraine has taken
reasonable steps in the face of these attacks—backing up the essential data of critical
systems, for example—it is hard to see how Russian cyber fires move Moscow much closer
to achieving its military objectives.
Against Industrial Control Systems. Although most Russian cyber fires have targeted
digital networks, some have attempted to manipulate or damage physical infrastructure
operated by industrial control systems. To date, however, there is no evidence that such
efforts have succeeded.

On April 8, the GRU’s notorious Unit 74455 sought to disrupt electricity in an unnamed
Ukrainian region by deploying malware inside a compromised utility network.57 This was the
culmination of a network intrusion that began in February or possibly earlier.58 The payload
was a more sophisticated adaptation of malware previously used by Unit 74455 in 2016 to
interrupt electric power in part of Ukraine.59 (The unit had done much the same in 2015 using
different malware.) Once deployed, the new malware was designed to make service difficult
to restore.60 Zhora said the hackers “planned to cut off 1.5 to 2 million Ukrainians from their
power supply.”61 Yet this time, Ukraine’s national Computer Emergency Response Team and
the Slovakia-headquartered cyber firm ESET detected and stopped the attack in progress.62
Ukraine initially circulated a document saying the hackers had been able to temporarily turn
off nine substations, but Zhora later called this erroneous preliminary information and said
that no power disruption occurred.63 A second failed cyber attack on electric power—
discussed in greater detail below—came to light on July 1.64
Compared to 2015–2016, Moscow’s wartime efforts to disrupt Ukrainian industrial control
systems show some technical growth but fewer actual results so far. Meanwhile, Russian
kinetic strikes on power infrastructure have caused serious problems throughout the country
during the entire length of the war. Periodic electricity blackouts have affected hundreds of
thousands to millions of Ukrainians and lasted hours to weeks.65 The impact on Ukraine’s
military is unknown, but the civilian suffering has ranged from manageable to severe.66 On
November 4, for example, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 4.5 million Ukrainians
had lost power due to a recent spate of Russian kinetic attacks on power supplies.67
Coordination of Cyber and Kinetic Fires. Since the outset of the war, analysts have
debated whether Russia’s cyber fires in Ukraine have been coordinated with kinetic
operations to achieve unified military objectives. The strongest evidence is hiding in plain
sight: in the twenty-four hours before its invasion, Moscow carried out its most numerous and
damaging cyber fires, including the Viasat hack and a massive salvo of destructive
operations. These attacks would have required significant preplanning and operational
coordination to align with the ground and air assault. But how much did Russia’s early
scheme of maneuver benefit from this cyber-kinetic coordination? Too little is known about
the effects of Russian cyber fires to make a very confident assessment. The Viasat hack,
discussed earlier, is the most plausible case of Russian cyber forces contributing to
combined arms operations. The hack was near-simultaneous with Russia’s first kinetic
attacks and may well have aided them—worsening what Kyiv’s front-line ground
commanders have called a communications-denied environment that impeded Ukrainian
defenses around the capital.
It was therefore not outlandish for Dmitri Alperovitch to call the Viasat hack “perhaps the
most strategically impactful cyber operation in wartime history,” though some qualification
and context is needed.68 Cyber intelligence operations, discussed later, have been part of
multiple modern wars and may outstrip cyber fires in strategic importance. For example, U.S.
intelligence agencies and military units have used a blend of cyber, signals intelligence
15/80

(SIGINT), and EW capabilities to geolocate and kill hundreds or thousands of individuals in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.69 If we consider only cyber fires, very few have been
conducted in wartime. The most well-known example is a gray zone incident: in 2007,
Israel’s cyber-enabled disruption of Syrian air defenses helped Israeli jets destroy a
clandestine nuclear site.70 To cyber skeptics, then, Alperovitch’s superlative assessment
might be taken as a backhanded compliment—a confirmation that wartime cyber operations
(or at least, cyber fires) have only modest value.
Since Russia’s initial surge of cyber fires, evidence of cyber-kinetic fires coordination has
been more fragmentary, and the handful of proposed cases seem less militarily
consequential. The coordination of cyber and kinetic fires could take several forms. To begin
with, Microsoft says that “on several occasions the Russian military has coupled its
cyberattacks with conventional weapons aimed at the same targets.”71 Microsoft analogized
this to “the combination of naval and ground forces long used in an amphibious invasion.”
Amphibious assaults are highly complex, extended endeavors; a simpler and clearer analogy
might be close air support. Just as air assets can be tasked to strike the same tactical targets
that ground forces are engaging, so can cyber and kinetic forces.
According to Microsoft, Russia has sometimes used “cyberattacks to disable computer
networks at a target before seeking to overrun it with ground troops or aerial or missile
attacks.” However, the cited examples were inapt. Microsoft highlighted March 2, when it
“identified a Russian group moving laterally on [a] nuclear power company’s computer
network. The next day, the Russian military attacked and occupied the company’s largest
nuclear power plant.” Around the same time, Russia “compromised a government computer
network in Vinnytsia and two days later launched eight cruise missiles at the city’s airport.”
But neither of these “cyberattacks” apparently resulted in any disabling effects, precluding
them from classification as successful cyber fires. If they were indeed coordinated with
physical attacks, they either failed to achieve their intended effects or they were meant as
cyber intelligence operations in support of kinetic targeting (discussed later in the paper).
A better example emerged on July 1, with Russian kinetic and cyber fires purportedly aiming
at the same target. That day, a Ukrainian power company called DTEK said that Russia had
unsuccessfully attempted a cyber attack on the company to “destabilise the technological
processes at power generating and distribution companies.”72 The Russian hacker group
XakNet, which claims semi-official ties to Moscow, took responsibility.73 At the same time,
Russian forces were carrying out artillery and/or missile attacks on DTEK’s Kryvorizka
thermal power plant in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. DTEK and Victor Zhora both
emphasized this connection, with the latter explicitly calling it a case of cyber-kinetic
coordination.74 That is one possibility, but additional context suggests that other
interpretations are equally if not more compelling.

16/80

The Kryvorizka plant is one of eight thermal power plants that DTEK operates across various
regions of Ukraine.75 DTEK also has numerous other electricity generation, distribution, and
related facilities throughout the country.76 Although Russian troops were clearly firing on
Kryvorizka, the cyber attack has not been described as targeting Kryvorizka specifically; it
could have been aimed at another DTEK facility or none in particular. Moreover, Russia
reportedly shelled Kryvorizka multiple times in the weeks and months before and after the
cyber attack—including on April 27,77 July 18,78 and August 2.79 And at the time of the cyber
attack, Russia was launching missile, artillery, and air strikes not only at Kryvorizka but also
across Dnipropetrovsk and three neighboring oblasts, among other locations.80 Russian
kinetic attacks on Ukrainian power infrastructure have been a routine feature of the war.81
All this suggests the possibility of a spurious correlation between the cyber and kinetic fires
on July 1. Indeed, DTEK noted that Russian cyber activities against the company began to
“spike” months earlier, in March, following the company’s public support for a boycott of
Russian energy. DTEK argued that Russia developed a “special focus” on it due to “the firm
and proactive position taken by the company’s shareholder Rinat Akhmetov with regards to
Russia’s barbaric war against Ukraine and massive assistance [DTEK] provided to the
Ukrainian army and support to Ukrainians.”82 This political motive for the cyber attack, if
accurate, would undercut the notion that XakNet’s main purpose was to support the tactical
aims of Russian troops in the field.
Microsoft acknowledged that it has been “been rare from our perspective” for “computer
network attacks” to “immediately precede[] a military attack.”83 It therefore outlined a second,
looser category of cyber-kinetic fires integration: threat activity targeting “the same sectors or
geographic locations around the same time as kinetic military events.” As an example,
Microsoft cited a destructive cyber attack by suspected Russian actors “against a major
broadcasting company on March 1, the same day that the Russian military announced its
intention to destroy ‘disinformation’ targets in Ukraine and directed a missile strike against a
TV tower in Kyiv.” While such cases might indicate “active coordinati[on],” Microsoft rightly
observed that they could also mean that “computer network operators and physical forces
are just independently pursuing a common set of priorities.” Regardless, the March 1 case
implies some unity of operational objective between cyber and kinetic fires. It raises two
further questions: How common is this phenomenon, and how valuable is it for Russian
military operations?
The Economist reported in November that “American, European and Ukrainian officials all
say that there are many examples of Russian cyber-attacks synchronised with physical
attacks.” 84 However, very few such examples have been publicly described, and many—if
not most—are uncompelling.
For example, Microsoft argued that Russia’s late-October barrage of missile and drone
strikes on Ukrainian energy and other civilian infrastructure was “accompanied by
[destructive GRU] cyberattacks on the same sectors. . . . The repeated temporal, sectoral,
17/80

and geographic association of these cyberattacks by Russian military intelligence with
corresponding military kinetic attacks indicate a shared set of operational priorities and
provides strong circumstantial evidence that the efforts are coordinated.”85 In support,
Microsoft cited five cyber incidents: one targeting Ukrainian and Polish transportation and
logistics companies, and four targeting other “critical infrastructure.” Yet none of these
incidents apparently targeted energy infrastructure, which was the primary focus of Russia’s
October missile barrage. To be sure, it is still notable that Russia in October resumed its
destructive cyber fires (after a lengthy quiet period) while also greatly intensifying its missile
and drone strikes. This may reflect some high-level alignment, even if close tactical
coordination remains unproven.
The very small number of reported examples suggests that it may not be particularly
common for Russian cyber and kinetic fires to strike similar targets at similar times. Although
the dearth of examples could reflect information gaps, it seems noteworthy that Microsoft—
which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars monitoring and securing Ukrainian networks,
and has participated actively in public debates about the war’s cyber dimensions—has only
catalogued a few suggestive incidents.86 In addition to these specific incidents, Microsoft has
proposed a general geographic correlation between Russian cyber operations and kinetic
attacks. Combining proprietary cyber data with third-party information on kinetic activities,
Microsoft found that “high concentrations of malicious network activity,” though not
necessarily fires, “frequently overlapped with high-intensity fighting during the first six-plus
weeks of the invasion.” However, the correlation was observed at the level of oblast, or
province. Ukraine’s oblasts average more than 9,000 square miles in size—probably too
large to make useful judgments of this kind. Furthermore, the degree of correlation was quite
limited. Cyber and kinetic activity matched (that is, “high-high” or “low-low”) in fifteen oblasts,
whereas it did not match (that is, “high-low” or “low-high”) in nine oblasts.
Effectiveness of Integrated Cyber-Kinetic Fires. Russia has probably achieved some
unity of purpose with certain cyber and kinetic fires, primarily through loose alignment and
more rarely via close coordination. But it is essential to ask, once again, what military
benefits this has yielded. The question of military gains must continually be brought back to
the foreground in any strategic analysis of Russia’s wartime cyber operations.
Consider another case highlighted by Microsoft: an unspecified “Dnipro government agency
[was] targeted with [a] destructive implant” on March 11, the same day that the “first direct
Russian strikes hit Dnipro government buildings, among others.”87 Further information about
the cyber attack is not publicly available, but Ukraine’s State Emergency Service announced
that three Russian airstrikes that day landed near a preschool and an apartment building and
struck a shoe factory (none of these were described as government buildings).88 One person
died. At this stage of the war, Dnipro had been largely spared from Russian attack, despite
some unverified earlier reports of limited strikes on noncivilian areas.89 The simultaneous
occurrence of a destructive cyber attack and the first major Russian strikes on the same city
is strong evidence of cyber-kinetic fires coordination—perhaps the best candidate since
18/80

February 24. It could be an example of what Max Smeets has called “pooled
interdependence,” where cyber and kinetic actions “may not directly depend on each other,
[but] each provides individual contributions to the same goal.”90
The military significance of these coordinated fires must be assessed in the context of
Russia’s campaign plans. In the preceding days, Russia had been observed massing troops
west of nearby Kharkiv, for the likely purpose of “launch[ing] a wide offensive southwest” to
“encircle” and assault Dnipro and other cities in the area.91 Russia may therefore have
intended to stoke fear and panic by striking civilian targets in Dnipro, setting the
psychological conditions for its planned siege of the city.
Lacking evidence of the cyber attack’s effects, we can explore plausible best-case scenarios
for Russia. The cyber attack may perhaps have added to a sense of unease among city
officials or residents, especially if it succeeded in deleting data. However, the death and
physical destruction caused by the missile strikes would presumably have had far greater
psychological impact. Given that the cyber attack targeted a government agency, it could
conceivably have hindered local officials’ response to the missiles—provided that the
affected agency was related to the strike targets, or was involved in emergency services,
public communication, or the like. The impact of such a cyber attack would depend on its
sophistication as well as the digital and operational resilience of the targeted agency. An
extreme best-case scenario for Russian cyber forces would posit that the missile wounded
but did not initially kill the Ukrainian victim, and the cyber attack then delayed emergency
medical services long enough to cause death. (A direct link between a cyber attack and a
fatal delay in medical care has been alleged only twice, globally, and not yet proven.92)
Speculatively, then, the cyber attack had somewhere between zero and marginal military
benefits for Russian operations in the area.
This operational-level assessment can, in turn, be translated to the strategic level by
considering the relevance of Dnipro to Moscow’s larger war efforts. Although Russia looked
poised to attack the city on March 11, it lacked the combat power to actually do so, according
to the Institute for the Study of War. The relevant Russian forces were bogged down by “the
protracted siege of Mariupol” and faced “the continued ability of Ukrainian forces to carry out
successful local counterattacks” near Kharkiv.93 By the time Russia took Mariupol, it had
missed the window to attack Dnipro. Moscow’s push into central Ukraine was proving
unsustainable and its overall war plan had clearly failed. Within weeks, Russian leaders
would finally accept this reality and shift to a near-exclusive focus on eastern Ukraine.94 In
the months since, Dnipro has not again been threatened by Russian troops, though it has
faced intermittent missile strikes on civilian and defense-related infrastructure.95
Ultimately, then, the March 11 cyber-kinetic fires on Dnipro were largely wasted efforts. This
case study shows the complexity of assessing the military impact of cyber-kinetic
coordination. Even tactically effective and operationally well-conceived combined-fires
actions can only contribute to strategic success if a sensible overall war plan is in place (see
19/80

Table 1). Granted, a single fires action of any kind can only have so much impact. But this
cyber operation was one of just several dozen Russian destructive attacks known to have
occurred during the entire war. Within such a small universe of operations, the impact of
each one matters in assessing the overall importance of Russian wartime cyber activities.

Cumulative Impacts. Russia’s ability to coordinate cyber and kinetic fires, although
important, is not necessarily determinative. Fires can have military effects even when they
are poorly or loosely coordinated across weapon systems and domains. For example,
Moscow has seized and held a fair amount of Ukrainian territory despite serious, persistent
problems in traditional combined arms integration. The Russian way of war is quite
imprecise: in Ukraine, Russian forces have generally sought to disrupt and demoralize
Ukraine’s society, government, and armed forces. Their cruder and more diffuse methods
have included random attacks on civilians in Russia-controlled areas, rape as a tool of war,
and terroristic missile strikes on civilian areas of cities far from the front lines. Russian tactics
have only become more indiscriminate as the war has dragged on. Yet this does not mean
they have had no military effect. By the same token, Russia’s large-scale cyber fires should
be assessed for their possible cumulative impact in Ukraine, notwithstanding their limited
coordination with kinetic operations.
Frameworks for assessing the battle damage of individual cyber operations remain
immature; understanding cumulative impact is even harder.96 Still, rough orders of
magnitude may be discernible and can have utility for analysts and policymakers. One
approach is to loosely compare the total effects of cyber and kinetic fires, based on available
quantitative and qualitative metrics. This can be done from two complementary perspectives.
Cyber fires can be understood as direct equivalents of kinetic fires, or alternatively, as
serving distinctive functions based on their unique features.

20/80

Table 2 directly compares some of the total effects of Russian cyber and kinetic fires against
similar classes of Ukrainian targets.97 This exercise has obvious limitations, both empirical
and conceptual. Missile strikes are not the same as data deletion attacks, and the various
military effects of each haven’t been fully documented in Ukraine. More fundamentally, high
numbers of attacks, body counts, and damaged targets do not equate to successful
warfighting. Even so, it is revealing that, during the first four months of the war, Russia
carried out 3,654 missile strikes but only about fifty destructive cyber attacks, according to
Ukrainian and Microsoft data.98 And it is fair to surmise that each missile strike, on average,
had greater military benefits for Russia than each destructive cyber attack. One can imagine
possible counterexamples—such as a destructive cyber attack that paralyzes Ukrainian rail
shipments and thereby delays the delivery of critical supplies to a contested front—but there
is no evidence of any (except possibly the Viasat hack).99 Rather, Microsoft has reported
“limited operational impact” from data deletions, whereas missile strikes have destroyed
many strategic Ukrainian assets such as military bases, heavy weapons plants, and port, rail,
and air infrastructure, in addition to civilian targets.

Many analysts resist a direct comparison between cyber “weapons” and their kinetic
counterparts. Instead, they emphasize the distinctiveness of cyber operations, such as their
ability to achieve reversible, deniable, or systemic effects. The unique features of cyber fires
indicate that militaries might sometimes use them in different situations, or for different
purposes, than kinetic fires. Table 3 evaluates these features in the context of Russia’s cyber
activity in Ukraine. It suggests that Russia has not taken advantage of them during the
war.100

Russia’s initial war plan arguably aimed to limit the amount of permanent,
physical, and collateral damage in Ukraine to facilitate eventual
occupation. Yet Russian data deletion attacks peaked during this early
period, indicating a willingness to cause permanent damage (at least
digitally) to Ukrainian organizations. Regardless, what Russian restraint
there was did not last long. Once the invasion foundered, Russia began to
inflict broad-based suffering, terror, and destruction in Ukraine—both as a
means of political pressure and due to lack of military professionalism. To
whatever extent Russia has been restraining its cyber fires in Ukraine,
continuing to do so would contravene its overall strategy and produce no
significant benefits.

Reversible
effects
Deniability

Moscow frequently portrays its war as less brutal than it is and seeks to
blame Ukraine for Russian atrocities. Cyber operations might conceivably
offer an extra layer of deniability. Under wartime conditions, however, this
deniability is even more implausible than usual. Observers have generally
assumed that Russia is culpable for all significant cyber operations
against Ukraine since the invasion began. More fundamentally, it is
Russia’s heinous kinetic attacks on civilians that have permanently
scarred its international reputation. Deniability of Russian cyber attacks is
beside the point when most Ukrainians and much of the world see Putin
as a historic war criminal.

Geographic
reach

Prior to the 2022 invasion, cyber operations offered Russia a way to act
inside Ukraine without physically exposing its personnel and equipment.
But once the war began, Russian kinetic attacks—especially missiles—
became able to strike anywhere in the country.

Costeffectiveness
and
scalability

A cyber operations unit operating inside Russian territory is likely cheaper
than a comparably sized combat arms unit that must be forward deployed
and supported by a long logistical tail. However, once Russia committed
to a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, many of the primary costs of physical
deployment became fixed and sunk. To the extent that Russian cyber
forces remain relatively cheap, this has not rendered them relatively
available for use at scale. Russia has been able to launch thousands of
missiles and perhaps millions of artillery shells due to “vast stockpiles” of
Soviet-era munitions—and “by some estimates, several years’ worth still
remains.” In contrast, Russia has mustered only dozens of significant
known cyber fires.

Systemic
effects

Cyber fires can theoretically cause systemic effects if they spread widely,
exploit single points of failure, or trigger cascading impacts on a series of
interconnected systems. Russia demonstrated this with its 2017 NotPetya
destructive attack, which disrupted hundreds of Ukrainian organizations
and many others around the world, causing $10 billion in economic
losses. However, no similar “wormable” malware has been detected since
the invasion, and Russia’s known cyber fires have not had any visible
cascading effects. In comparison, Russia’s kinetic strikes on electric
power infrastructure have resulted in failures of water, telecoms, and
other basic services, with likely third-order impacts as well.

Conclusion. Overall, cyber fires have not added meaningfully to Russia’s kinetic firepower,
nor have they performed special functions that kinetic weapons could not. Rather than
serving in a niche role, many Russian cyber fires have targeted the same categories of
Ukrainian systems also prosecuted by kinetic weapons—such as communications, electricity,
and transportation infrastructure. For almost all these target categories, kinetic fires seem to
have caused multiple orders of magnitude more damage. Although cyber fires potentially
offer unique benefits in certain circumstances, these benefits have not been realized in
Russia’s war against Ukraine. Moscow’s military strategists quickly discarded any aim of
reducing physical or collateral damage or creating reversible effects in Ukraine, and Russia
has gained little deniability or geographic reach from cyber operations. Likewise, Russian
cyber fires have not achieved any systemic effects, and they have arguably been less costeffective—or at least more capacity-constrained—than kinetic fires.
Intelligence Collection
Compared to their focus on cyber fires, commentators have paid much less attention to
whether and how cyber intelligence collection may be supporting the Russian war effort. For
example, Lennart Maschmeyer and Myriam Dunn Cavelty argued that Russia has not carried
out “cyberwar” in Ukraine, equating this concept with “high-level, destructive cyberattack[s]
on civilian critical infrastructures.”101 While acknowledging that “cyber operations . . . remain
useful for stealthy intelligence operations,” Maschmeyer and Cavelty nevertheless treated
intelligence collection as something outside of “cyberwar.” Similarly, Chris Krebs wrote that
“Moscow’s proven cyber capabilities took a back seat in the overall [Russian war]
strategy.”102 He based this broad assessment on a narrow look at Russia’s disruptive and
destructive cyber attacks, without addressing cyber intelligence operations. Likewise, Erica
Lonergan, Shawn Lonergan, Brandon Valeriano, and Benjamin Jensen observed in the
24/80

context of Ukraine that cyber operations “don’t win wars, but instead support espionage,
deception, subversion and propaganda efforts.”103 This dichotomy omits the fact that
espionage during wartime might indeed help one side win.
In fact, intelligence collection accounts for a significant portion, perhaps even a majority, of
Moscow’s wartime cyber operations in Ukraine. Ukraine’s national cybersecurity agency has
reported that “enemy hackers” carried out 242 “information gathering” operations during the
first four months of the war.104 By comparison, the agency counted only 56 cyber operations
that affected the “availability” of Ukrainian systems (that is, cyber fires). To be sure, cyber
operations are difficult to meaningfully quantify and accurately characterize. The same
Ukrainian government document counted an even greater number of cyber operations (498)
as falling into ambiguous categories—such as “intrusion,” “intrusion attempt,” or “malicious
code”—that do not indicate a clear perpetrator intent or operational outcome. The
CyberPeace Institute, which relies on public data and records only cyber incidents impacting
civilian systems, gives a lower total number of incidents. Still, it too shows that data thefts
(43) were more frequent than destructive cyber attacks (15) from late February through
October.105 (CyberPeace also recorded 103 disruptive cyber attacks during this period—
mostly low-level incidents that are easy to carry out and have limited impact.)
These figures are far from definitive, but they match what one might expect. Militaries at war
do more than just launch attacks: intelligence remains a crucial task, even after fighting
breaks out. U.S. doctrine, for example, defines intelligence as one of seven joint military
functions—equivalent in stature to fires. And we know from peacetime and gray zone
conditions that cyber operations can be a powerful espionage tool. This may be no less true
in wartime. To remedy the lack of attention given to Russian wartime cyber intelligence
collection, this section assesses some key ways that such collection might aid Moscow’s
larger war effort: by providing support to strategic planning, targeting, occupation activities,
influence operations, and/or negotiations.
For Strategic Planning. In the lead-up to February 24, the critical military decisions for
Moscow were whether, when, and how to attack Ukraine. Putin’s process for making these
decisions is unclear, but a rational leader would want intelligence assessments of Ukraine’s
ability and willingness to resist an invasion (among other topics), and Russian security
services made significant efforts to meet this need. Ukrainian officials say their intercepts
show that, from 2019 to 2021, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) unit responsible
for Ukraine quintupled in size.106 Moscow recruited Ukrainian spies not only to provide
sensitive information but also to prepare acts of subversion and to facilitate political handover
in the event of a Russian invasion. More than 800 Ukrainians—including some senior
intelligence officers and opposition politicians—have recently been accused of covertly
working for Russia. Moscow supplemented these human intelligence (HUMINT) activities
with other kinds of collection. A research firm “with close ties to the FSB” conducted

25/80

extensive polling in the run-up to the war, “quer[ying] Ukrainians about invasion scenarios in
extraordinary detail” to determine how ordinary people would view Russian invaders and
whether they would fight back.
Information gleaned from cyber operations was probably also part of Moscow’s intelligence
picture. Western analysts have long believed that Russia has pervasively penetrated
Ukrainian phone networks.107 In 2014 and 2017, for example, U.S. officials accused Russia
of repeatedly recording and leaking sensitive, high-level phone conversations between
Washington and Kyiv. Until 2014, most Ukrainian telecoms networks were owned by
Russians or Russian-Ukrainians. While this changed after the annexation of Crimea,
Moscow’s likely former knowledge and access could still be facilitating ongoing intrusions.
Russia’s cyber espionage, much like its HUMINT activities, grew in the run-up to war.
Microsoft reported that “as 2021 progressed, threat actors representing multiple Russian
government security services converged on Ukraine to surveil or compromise organizations
that could provide valuable intelligence on a Ukrainian military, diplomatic, or humanitarian
response to Russian military action.”108 The “target pool” included “Ukrainian defense,
defense industrial base, foreign policy, national and local administration, law enforcement,
and humanitarian organizations.”
It is difficult to judge the utility of Russia’s prewar cyber intelligence collection. We lack
concrete insight into what information Russian hackers were able to obtain from Ukrainian
networks, how analysts in Moscow weighed cyber intelligence against data gathered from
other sources, what assessments were ultimately communicated to Putin, and how these
reports might have influenced his final decisions to approve and execute the initial war plan.
What we do know is that Moscow grossly underestimated Ukraine’s political and military
staying power, likely for a multitude of reasons.109 Russian intelligence agencies have been
blamed for their unreliable human sources in Ukraine, their embezzlement of funds, their
history of deficits in analytic capability, their poisonous inter-service rivalries, and their lack of
candor (both internally and when communicating with Putin). Meanwhile, Putin-watchers
have suggested that ideological fervor and poor judgment led him to misinterpret or discount
the information available to him. While Kremlinologists debate these factors’ relative
importance, the overall picture seems clear: deep institutional weaknesses prevented the
Russian state from accurately assessing Ukraine’s politico-military situation.110 In such an
environment, cyber intelligence collection—no matter how exquisite and voluminous— may
have had limited relevance.
For Targeting. Perhaps the most obvious wartime use of cyber intelligence collection is to
provide targeting information for kinetic attacks. This can be done in many different ways,
two of which are explored below.
First, Russia could use cyber operations to surveil and reconnoiter potential high-value
targets for deliberate, precision strikes. Moscow has launched thousands of missiles, air
strikes, and precision artillery rounds during the war.111 Russian stockpiles were large but
26/80

finite, suggesting the potential value of intelligence in confirming the importance of priority
targets and identifying specific aimpoints to cause maximum lasting damage. Although
Russian forces have frequently used precision weapons against less significant targets, they
have achieved greater impact when attacking strategic Ukrainian assets such as the Yavoriv
military base (destroyed by a thirty-missile salvo) and heavy weapons manufacturing
plants.112 Other frequent targets of Russian strikes include port, rail, air, and energy
infrastructure, as well as residential and commercial areas (likely targeted to terrorize the
populace).113
It is inherently hard to observe whether and how Russian cyber intelligence operations are
informing deliberate strikes. Still, Microsoft has highlighted two cases where a Russian
network intrusion was followed several days later by a Russian missile strike on a seemingly
related target. On March 4, assessed GRU cyber actors “compromised a government
computer network in Vinnytsia”114; two days later, Russia launched eight cruise missiles that
damaged military and civilian portions of the Vinnytsia airport, including two control towers
and an aircraft.115 Separately, on April 29, another GRU cyber actor was seen “active[ly
operating] within” a “transportation sector network” in Lviv; four days later, Russia missiles
struck electrical substations alongside Lviv’s railway.116 In both cases, the timelines make it
plausible that Russian cyber actors were feeding intelligence to missile targeteers. However,
more detailed information would be needed to support such an assessment and evaluate its
significance.
For example, Microsoft has not said whether the compromised Vinnytsia government
computer network had any connection to the airport, and if so, whether Russian hackers
obtained any data relevant for missile targeting. Assuming they did, the next question would
be whether cyber espionage actually enhanced the missile strikes’ effectiveness—that is, by
helping to confirm the target’s priority and/or refine the aimpoints, and to do this more
accurately or rapidly than non-cyber intelligence sources could. By way of example, Russia
apparently relied on HUMINT agents to designate certain strike targets in the early hours of
the war.117 But some of these agents provided outdated information that failed to account for
last-minute dispersal of aircraft and air defense systems. Had Russian strikes been informed
by cyber-enabled communications intercepts or real-time geolocation of key assets and
units, Moscow might have had more success in initial operations, such as the crucial
airborne assault on Hostomel’s Antonov Airport.
From the sparse data available, it isn’t obvious that cyber intelligence would have been
important for the Vinnytsia or Lviv strikes. Cyber espionage would not be needed to discern
the Vinnytsia airport’s military importance: its dual-use status was public knowledge, and
radar tracks would have confirmed the frequency and patterns of military and civilian flights.
Key infrastructure targeted by the missiles—including control towers—was readily identifiable
in satellite imagery. The Lviv railway and substations were also in plain sight, though it is
conceivable that Russian cyber espionage helped to confirm the railway’s logistical
importance and its dependence on the targeted substations. (Microsoft assessed that an
27/80

unrelated GRU cyber operation in Ukraine and Poland “almost certainly collected intelligence
on supply routes and logistics operations that could facilitate future attacks.”118) Even so, the
strike’s ultimate military impact remains unclear. The day that it happened, a senior U.S.
defense official said that “we’re still assessing sort of the damage, [but] it’s not clear that
they’ve been very accurate in trying to hit that critical infrastructure, and there’s been no
perishable impact that we’ve seen to impeding or in any other way obstructing with the
Ukrainians’ ability to replenish and restore themselves.”119 Microsoft would later state that
the Lviv missile strike “disrupt[ed] transport service” in “a key logistical center for the
movement of military and humanitarian aid.”120
In addition to informing the deliberate targeting process for strategic missile and airstrikes,
Russian cyber actors might also try to geolocate groupings of Ukrainian forces in real time to
support tactical fires such as artillery. The sheer firepower of Russian artillery has been a
crucial factor for Moscow, “offsetting” the “generally mediocre performance of Russia’s
ground forces” for much of the war.121 Many of Russia’s artillery fires have been crude and
terroristic: “sustained bombardment,” often “overwhelming and indiscriminate,” has “levelled
[civilian] settlements and infrastructure” in cities such as Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Mariupol.
But well-aimed artillery fires have also been crucial to Russia on the battlefield, “preventing
Ukrainian forces from massing to counterattack and causing considerable attrition to those
units holding the line. . . . Particularly in Sievierodonetsk, Russian artillery was the key to
preventing Ukrainian forces from turning the tables in the close fight as they did in the Battle
for Kyiv prior to the Russian withdrawal from that axis.” With Russia firing about 20,000
shells per day as of July, granular targeting intelligence (perhaps from cyber operations)
could perhaps have substantial effect.122
Some believe that Russia already demonstrated such a cyber capability in the pre–2022
Donbas conflict. CrowdStrike has claimed that, from 2014 to 2016, GRU cyber actors tricked
Ukrainian soldiers into downloading a malicious version of an artillery targeting app. The
infected app was capable of harvesting the victims’ “gross locational data,” potentially
enabling pro-Russian units to “identify the general location of Ukrainian artillery forces and
engage them.”123 The malware by itself could not geolocate users with sufficient accuracy to
“directly facilitate” counterbattery fire. Rather, the harvested data were said to reveal a rough
area for later search by pro-Russian UAVs, which would then “finalize” the targeting process
using overhead imagery. The Ukrainian government, the app designer, and some Western
cyber analysts disputed CrowdStrike’s report—casting doubt on the existence of the
compromise, the attribution to Russia, and the claimed battlefield effects. The company
largely stood behind its analysis.124
So far, no similar reports have emerged since the 2022 invasion, despite Ukrainian forces’
even more widespread and effective use of apps for artillery targeting and other purposes.125
Russian cyber actors might have a variety of ways to try to geolocate Ukrainian units—for
example, by compromising cell networks. But field research and interviews in Ukraine have
not uncovered any evidence of Russian artillery fire being cued by cyber-enabled
28/80

geolocation. Rather, a detailed report by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds found that Russian
artillery units use UAV reconnaissance, EW direction finding, acoustic reconnaissance, or
counterbattery artillery radar to find Ukrainian positions.126 Of these, only UAV
reconnaissance was able to consistently cue somewhat timely and accurate Russian artillery
fire; other mechanisms were more bogged down by “systemic friction and slowed
responsiveness” in Russian battlefield communication, coordination, and decisionmaking.
This suggests that if Russian cyber actors have somehow geolocated Ukrainian forces
without their knowledge, the resulting data must still be confirmed or refined through
overhead imagery—much as CrowdStrike had supposed.
Instead of hacking cell phones to acquire real-time geolocation, Russian cyber actors might
try to find Ukrainian military equipment by hacking it directly. But there have been no
credible, specific reports of this. To counter Ukrainian UAVs, for example, Russia relies on
signal jamming or EW direction finding of ground operators, according to Watling and
Reynolds; there were no reports of Ukrainians UAVs or their control software being
hacked.127 Many of Ukraine’s other combat systems are Soviet-era and pre-digital.128
Although Western-provided systems could in theory be more vulnerable to cyber intrusions,
Russian claims of successful penetrations appear to be bluster. A Russian military expert
alleged in August that the U.S.-made HIMARS rocket launcher “has been hacked . . .
instantly fixing the launch site.”129 Around the same time, Moscow began claiming successful
hits on many HIMARS systems. However, the Pentagon confirmed that all HIMARS were
accounted for, and Ukrainian sources said that Russia had launched cruise missiles at
wooden decoys.130 If this is true, the decoys would further confirm Russia’s reliance on
overhead imagery—not cyber-enabled geolocation—for targeting in the field.
For Occupation. Cyber intelligence collection can be militarily useful even after territory has
been seized. Where Russia has controlled parts of Ukraine, its occupation forces must
suppress local resistance. In theory, smart occupiers would also seek to restore basic
services and administer territory in a way that might build local political support and extract
economic value over time. Moscow has focused more on suppression than on rebuilding and
administration. Shortly before the invasion, Washington warned the United Nations that
“Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps
following a military operation.”131 This warning did not specify what sources of intelligence
Russia was relying on to develop such lists. Open sources would be adequate to identify the
most prominent figures hostile to Russian interests, such as politicians, journalists, and
intellectuals. Russia’s human agents in Ukraine could then help to provide a more textured
understanding of the political scene and perhaps identify less prominent likely resisters.
(Moscow reportedly recruited at least two possible slates for national leadership of a puppet
state, paid numerous collaborators and saboteurs throughout the country, and has found cooptees to run some occupied Ukrainian cities.132)

29/80

Cyber operations could supplement these traditional information sources in several ways.
First, mass data collection (such as communication records, geolocation, and metadata)
might be used to identify ordinary Ukrainian citizens with links to partisan activity—people
without a public record of activism and who aren’t personally known to Russia’s agents.
Cyber activity potentially intended for this purpose has included relentless Russian attempts
to penetrate Ukraine’s telecommunications companies. Second, targeted cyber espionage
could help to verify the political intelligence Moscow receives from its HUMINT sources. The
reliability of these sources has been a persistent challenge for Russian intelligence agencies
before and during the war. Third, stolen public databases (like address lists and passport
information) could facilitate the tracking, arrest, and/or assassination of targeted individuals.
For example, shortly before the invasion, Russian cyber actors breached Ukraine’s Ministry
of Internal Affairs and acquired a national car insurance database, among other relevant
data.133 Granted, similar information might be directly available to Russian occupiers via
Ukrainian computer networks and personnel physically under their control. But Ukrainians
sometimes wiped key data in advance of Russian territorial gains, putting a greater premium
on any information that Russian hackers had already obtained from afar.134
Despite the many ways that cyber intelligence collection might be useful to Russian
occupiers, Moscow has generally seemed to favor cruder, harsher tactics in its areas of
influence. Rather than assembling a careful intelligence picture of local citizenry to facilitate
the selective suppression of key resisters while currying favor with others, Russian forces
have more often carried out brutal and at times indiscriminate large-scale violence, relied on
physical intimidation, and neglected to restore basic services (including internet) in many
areas.135 Russian atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, particularly Bucha, represent an extreme
case of a pattern observed throughout the country: countless instances of arbitrary killings,
rapes, looting, and other crimes committed by poorly trained and loosely supervised Russian
troops who choose their victims casually or even randomly.136
In Mariupol, Russian forces essentially demolished the city before taking over, causing at
least three-quarters of the residents to flee.137 Weeks passed without any serious effort to
restore basic services such as electricity, communications, and medical care.138 Internet and
phone service remained very limited one month after the takeover. Even after three months,
most citizens still lacked electricity or running water.139 In the Donbas, Kyiv has said that
Moscow deported more than a million Ukrainian citizens to Russia. People who remain have
been subjected to “humiliation, torture, robbery—or arbitrary, extrajudicial killing.”140 This
roughly tracks with how Russia and its militia allies have governed eastern Ukrainian territory
under their control since 2014. Reports from the Donbas depict Russian neglect and chaos,
not a sophisticated surveillance state.141
The most notable exception was Kherson. Within a few weeks of taking the city, Russian
occupiers ordered local Ukrainian officials to reroute internet and mobile traffic through
Russian national infrastructure—enabling Moscow to apply its own internet regulations,
surveillance, and censorship to Kherson.142 Citizens could only buy SIM cards with Russian
30/80

phone numbers and had to display their passports to do so. Russian authorities blocked
access to Ukrainian and independent news media, as well as Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter—though not Telegram. The special efforts to control Kherson’s internet could stem
from the fact that it was “the only provincial Ukrainian capital captured intact by Russian
forces” and other cities were simply too decimated to be worth the effort.143 Kherson’s
geographic location (near Russian-controlled Crimea), economic value (as a port city), and
political status (annexation was planned) may have also played a role. Kherson showed that,
under the right circumstances, Russian occupation forces place high value on cyber
surveillance. At the same time, it seemed to indicate that physical control of
telecommunications networks offers the ultimate cyber collection toolkit for occupiers; next to
this, remote hacking would be a more modest capability.
For Influence Activities. The full breadth of Russia’s wartime influence, propaganda, and
disinformation activities in Ukraine is vast and beyond the scope of this paper. But there are
at least two ways that cyber operations can provide direct intelligence or operational support
to Russian influence efforts. First, Russian cyber actors can carry out so-called hack-andleak operations—the digital theft and publication of sensitive data meant to discredit, distract,
or demoralize victims. In March, Microsoft observed two different cyber actors—one tied to
the GRU, and the other a “suspected Russian threat actor”—compromise “an institution in
Ukraine that was featured in false Russian weapons conspiracies in the past.”144 It is unclear
whether any sensitive data were exfiltrated or later published. The CyberPeace Institute has
documented just five hack-and-leak incidents targeting Ukraine, including three by the selfdescribed Russian hacktivist group XakNet.145 (By comparison, Russia has suffered sixtythree such incidents during the war.)
Second, Russian cyber actors can use compromised systems or networks as platforms for
disseminating influence material. In March, a deepfake video of Zelenskyy calling on
Ukrainians to surrender was uploaded to social media.146 Hackers then gained access to a
TV channel, Ukraine 24, to help spread the fictitious story. They placed a still image from the
video on the channel’s website, and they edited the chyron text, scrolling below the live TV
broadcast, to reflect the deepfake narrative. Despite these efforts, the video was
unconvincing and readily debunked.
Later in March, Ukrainian intelligence announced the discovery and remediation of a botnet
in the Dnipropetrovsk region that was being remotely controlled by Russia’s security
services.147 Moscow had reportedly used the botnet to send about 5,000 propaganda text
messages to Ukrainian troops and law enforcement. This number seems small, given that
Russia has been sending similar texts since 2014, often using fake cell towers rather than
cyber operations.148 The effectiveness of these messages is unknown. The morale of
Ukrainian forces has waxed and waned during the conflict, with some desertions occurring in
June.149 The core problem then was high casualties driven by Russia’s artillery

31/80

overmatch.150 Propaganda texts would be a marginal factor by comparison, though they
could help to cement and aggravate the preexisting concerns of Ukrainian troops and
civilians.
From public evidence, it does not seem that Russian cyber actors have made very serious
efforts to support influence operations in Ukraine. But undiscovered or undisclosed activities
may reveal a different picture.
For Negotiations. Russia and Ukraine conducted several high-level negotiations in late
February and March, which did not yield any significant results. There have subsequently
been limited, fragile agreements on some humanitarian issues, but no serious proposals for
large-scale cease-fires or a negotiated settlement of the war.151 Still, many observers expect
the war will someday end at the bargaining table.152 At that stage, Moscow could greatly
benefit from strategic intelligence on Ukrainian senior leadership—its perceptions, intentions,
plans, stances, debates, and schisms. Even now, with no negotiations on the horizon,
intelligence on Zelenskyy’s inner circle could help Putin and his military chiefs design military
operations to maximize political leverage.
The Ukrainian government has detected “a lot of attempts to hack Ukrainian officials’
phones, mainly with the spreading of malware,” though it claimed in June that none of these
attempts were known to be successful.153 Top leaders have secure devices and networks
available for some purposes. Washington gave Zelenskyy a “secure satellite phone” to
communicate with the U.S. government, and his office apparently possesses secure landline
networks for internal communication with national security agencies.154 Generally speaking,
Ukrainian counterintelligence and operational security efforts have outperformed all
reasonable expectations—as demonstrated by the numerous foiled attempts to assassinate
Zelenskyy.155
Still, Zelenskyy and his inner circle have some inherent cyber vulnerabilities owing to their
necessary use of unsecured internet and cell connections. Zelenskyy’s masterful social
media activity has been crucial in rallying the Ukrainian people to resist Russian aggression
and in persuading foreign leaders and societies to provide essential military, humanitarian,
and diplomatic aid. Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office, said that in the early
weeks of the war, “he regularly texted photos of slain Ukrainian children and ruined Ukrainian
homes to the cellphones of officials around the world, including Jake Sullivan, the White
House national security adviser; Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for
European and Eurasian affairs; and members of Congress.”156 Zelenskyy, Yermak, and other
close confidants may benefit from software encryption in some contexts. But in general, their
use of internet-connected devices—although a strategic imperative—will create continued
opportunities for Russian cyber actors to try to collect intelligence. If the Russians succeed in
this, the impact on eventual negotiations may manifest in the future and might never be
known.

32/80

Conclusion. Intelligence collection—not fires—has likely been the main focus of Russia’s
wartime cyber operations in Ukraine, yet this too has yielded little military benefit (see Table
4).157 Many of Moscow’s military intelligence needs can be fulfilled more readily by non-cyber
sources. More fundamentally, Russia’s ham-fisted overall approach to the war—from its
campaign planning to its occupation of seized territory—suggests that key military decisions
are not guided by a rigorous all-source intelligence process.

significant negotiations
have taken place since
earlier in the war, so the
strategic impact of any
relevant cyber
intelligence collection
remains to be
determined.

Despite Moscow’s institutional limitations, it might still achieve cyber intelligence
breakthroughs as the war progresses. Conceivably, Russian hackers could obtain real-time
geolocation data that enable the assassination of Zelenskyy or the timely and accurate
targeting of Ukrainian forces, particularly those with high-value Western weapons systems.
They might also conduct hack-and-leak operations revealing sensitive war information to the
Ukrainian and Western public, such as Ukraine’s combat losses, internal schisms, or military
35/80

doubts; or collect valuable information about Kyiv’s perceptions and intentions that can aid
Moscow at future talks, among other scenarios. Russian intelligence collection therefore
represents the greatest ongoing cyber risk to Ukraine.

Why Have Russian Cyber Operations Not Had Greater Strategic Impact?
Most Western observers agree that Russian cyber operations have not had much strategic
impact in Ukraine, but there is less consensus on why. Some cite Russia’s cyber incapacity
or reticence, while others point to the defensive efforts of Ukraine and its allies. Analysts also
vary in whether they focus on the circumstances of this particular war, or on the role of
cyberspace in warfare generally. Anne Neuberger, U.S. deputy national security advisor for
cyber and emerging technology, acknowledged in July that there are “any number of theories
for what we saw, and quite frankly, what we didn’t see.” She observed that “some argue that
we don’t quite know” why Russian hackers failed to cause greater disruptions of Ukrainian
communications and electric power (for example), and said that “it’s certainly something
we’re watching very closely” in intelligence and cyber policy circles.158
Below is a review of twenty-five different factors that have been proposed by Ukrainian and
Western officials, companies, and commentators, including some that emerged from this
paper’s analysis. Building on the observations and arguments made above, each proposed
factor is tentatively assigned high, moderate, or low importance as an explanatory factor
(summarized in Table 5). This reflects one reasonable interpretation of the evidence.
Individually, these assessments are debatable. Collectively, they reveal that many factors
were likely at play. Although some analysts have contended that one or two particular factors
were decisive, this appears doubtful. More likely, the reversal of several factors—even one or
two with high importance—would not have been enough to significantly improve the overall
military utility of Russian cyber operations. In other words, Russia’s low cyber success in
Ukraine seems to have been overdetermined.

36/80

Russian Planning, Organization, and Doctrine
Factor 1: Russia’s corrupt, incompetent, and ideological national security institutions
made cyber intelligence collection less useful for military decisionmaking.
Moderate importance. If Moscow had a competent and candid strategic decisionmaking
process prior to the war, then cyber intelligence on the state of Ukraine’s military and politics
might have been valuable in formulating initial Russian war plans, including Putin’s crucial
decision about whether to invade. We don’t know what kind of intelligence Russia’s cyber
37/80

actors obtained prior to the war. And arguably, human and open sources would provide more
relevant information on Ukraine’s strategic situation—though cyber intelligence can be used
to help confirm such information. In any case, we do know that Russia grossly
underestimated Ukraine’s military and political staying power. This suggests that relevant
cyber intelligence, if it did exist, was ignored or discounted by Moscow’s intelligence analysts
and decisionmakers.
Factor 2: Russia compartmentalized its invasion plans, leaving cyber operators
unable to prepare.
AND
Factor 3: Russia anticipated a rapid military victory that would not require significant
cyber operations.
Low importance. The quantity and quality of Russian cyber fires actually peaked in the days
immediately before and after the invasion, when Moscow launched the Viasat hack and a
huge spate of destructive attacks. Russian cyber fires subsequently declined in number,
novelty, and impact. If advanced planning were Russia’s key limiting factor, one would expect
the opposite pattern, as Russian cyber operators would gradually adapt to wartime
conditions and began to plan and execute operations in earnest. Indeed, senior Ukrainian
cyber official Victor Zhora has so far proved prescient in his April prediction that Russian
offensive cyber operations had “likely reached their full potential” and would not “scale” any
further.159 Nine months into the war, there is little reason to suppose that Russia still needs
more time to ramp up its cyber operations. While better initial planning could perhaps have
made early Russian cyber fires more effective than they were, the overall nature of these
operations—which sought to disrupt government and civilian communications and systems
on a wide scale—is largely what one would expect based on Russian doctrine and general
military principles.
Factor 4: Russia had across-the-board deficits in combined arms warfare.
Moderate importance. Russian forces have struggled in many different ways to synchronize
their activities—across warfighting domains, military services, geographic areas, and
functional disciplines—and these deficits have significantly hindered Moscow’s overall war
efforts. When a military has so many serious failures of coordination, including among
military roles that have coexisted for decades, the introduction of a newer and less mature
capability like cyber inevitably presents enormous coordination challenges. It is likely that
better coordination with kinetic forces would have enhanced the military utility of Russian
wartime cyber operations. However, the size of this effect isn’t clear.
On the one hand, Moscow’s cyber operations seemed to have their greatest strategic impact
when they were most closely integrated with kinetic operations. The high watermark on both
scores came in the first days of the war. That was when Moscow executed its most militarily
38/80

consequential known cyber operation (the Viasat hack), and its largest spate of destructive
cyber operations, to coincide with ground and air operations. On the other hand, Russia’s
early cyber success depended not only on cyber-kinetic coordination but also on its initially
large stockpile of preplanned cyber fires. In the weeks that followed, Moscow’s cyber fires
declined precipitously as Russian hackers proved unable to maintain such a high operational
tempo. Once Russian cyber fires slowed to a trickle (relative to the size of the war), the
benefits of coordination with kinetic operations would likewise have fallen. Improving cyberkinetic coordination probably would not have seemed like a smart priority for Russian theater
commanders.
Factor 5: Russian cyber units were organizationally isolated from combat units.
AND
Factor 6: Russian cyber doctrine emphasized intelligence, subversion, and
psychological warfare rather than combat integration.
Moderate importance. The GRU has been Russia’s lead provider of cyber fires in the
Ukraine war.160 Microsoft stated in December that all “destructive attacks against Ukrainian
targets in support of the Russian war effort have been the responsibility of” GRU-associated
actors.161 Although part of the military, the GRU is a national-level element that specializes in
intelligence, subversion, and assassination; it is not designed for close integration with
regular troops in conditions of large-scale combat. This may help explain why the GRU
succeeded in executing a strategic cyber campaign (Viasat and early wipers) to coincide with
the initial invasion, but has subsequently failed to show much tactical coordination with
Russian units on the ground. However, Russia’s cyber intelligence collection operations—
presumably a GRU strong point—have not seemed any more impactful than its cyber fires.
In particular, public evidence suggests that cyber operations have offered surprisingly feeble
support to influence activities, a GRU hobbyhorse. All this suggests that doctrine isn’t the
whole story.
Russian Cyber Capability and Capacity
Factor 7: Russian cyber forces were too small to meaningfully contribute to a fullscale war.
High importance. To make a serious difference in Moscow’s war effort, Russian cyber
operations would need to scale to match the size of the war itself. At best, this was achieved
only in the war’s earliest weeks. Overall, however, Russian cyber operations have barely
registered on the grand scale of Moscow’s military ambitions and high-intensity combat
operations in Ukraine.

39/80

To review, Moscow sent more than 150,000 troops to subdue the whole of Ukraine, a country
with 44 million people and one of the largest land areas in Europe. Russia launched
simultaneous offensives on multiple axes and sent standoff strikes at Ukrainian targets—
ultimately thousands of them—in all regions. Eventually, Moscow scaled back its military
mission to focus on eastern Ukraine. Even so, the war remained large enough that cyber
operations would need to be either incredibly frequent or remarkably effective (or better yet,
both at once) to make a measurable difference. Yet Russia’s significant known cyber fires
have amounted to just a few dozen data deletion operations and two failed industrial control
disruptions. Among these, the Viasat hack is the only case where public evidence suggests
much plausible military impact. In sum, Moscow’s cyber onslaught was unprecedented by
peacetime and gray zone standards—but it was small relative to the war in Ukraine.
It is unclear whether Moscow took steps to grow its cyber forces, either before or after the
invasion. Russia’s large and highly capable cybercrime ecosystem has not visibly
participated in the war to the extent many had anticipated. The Russian state has long
tolerated and co-opted cyber criminals, leading analysts to expect they would be activated as
an auxiliary force during crisis or wartime. Although some purported Russian criminal groups
and hacker collectives have targeted Ukraine, and XakNet in particular has carried out
several noteworthy operations, much of the criminal activity has been low-level denial of
service.162 Overt activity by major Russian ransomware gangs has largely focused on nonUkrainian targets.163 However, Russian criminals may be lending assistance in ways that are
difficult to detect.
Factor 8: Russia has been slow to regenerate cyber capability once used.
High importance. If Russian cyber forces had somehow managed to maintain the historic
tempo of significant operations seen at the war’s outset, they could well have had strategic
impacts over time. But Russia suffered a steep drop-off in quantity and quality of cyber fires
after the first few weeks of the war. The decline of novel wipers, and related tactical shifts by
Russian hackers, suggests a limited stockpile of technical resources.
Factor 9: Russia chose not to focus its full cyber capacity on Ukraine.
Moderate importance. The Russian government refrained from conducting significant
destructive or disruptive cyber attacks against Ukraine’s Western allies from the outset of the
war until October, when the GRU carried out a ransomware attack on logistics and
transportation companies—two in Ukraine and one in Poland.164 Even so, Moscow has
continued to carry out large-scale cyber espionage and other network penetrations on a
global scale. Russian cyber operations against Western targets have either remained stable
or increased since the invasion began, judging from numerous reports by Western
governments and cybersecurity firms. While the GRU has taken the lead on Russian cyber
operations in Ukraine, Moscow’s other cyber-capable agencies (such as the Foreign
Intelligence Service, or SVR) have largely focused elsewhere.165
40/80

Statistics published by Microsoft paint a picture of divided Russian attention. The company
reports that “64 percent of Russian threat activity against known targets was directed at
[networks operated by] Ukraine-based organizations between late February and June.”166
Granted, this level of concentration is a striking reflection of Russia’s new wartime priorities;
Victor Zhora has said that Moscow tripled its cyber operations against Ukraine from prewar
baselines.167 But Microsoft’s figure also means that more than a third of this type of Russian
cyber activity continued to be directed outside of Ukraine. The company separately counted
Russian attempts to compromise customer accounts on Microsoft-operated online services
like Office 365. Surprisingly, just 2 percent of this activity targeted Ukraine. Although
Ukrainians comprise a tiny portion of these services’ user base, one might still expect
Russian cyber actors to have targeted these Ukrainians with greater intensity.168
From Russia’s perspective, the wisdom of this cyber resource allocation can be debated. On
the one hand, Putin views the Ukraine war as existential, implying it should command all
available resources. On the other hand, the war has created a number of new national
security challenges for Moscow beyond Ukraine’s borders. In addition to supporting combat
operations, Russian cyber actors must monitor and suppress domestic dissent, collect
intelligence on Kyiv’s Western allies and seek to deter them from further intervention, and try
to obtain technologies that are now denied to Russia via export controls and sanctions.169
Regardless of its rationale or merits, Russia’s decision to maintain and perhaps even expand
its global cyber target list has reduced the cyber capacity available for use in Ukraine.
That said, a different resource allocation might not result in dramatically different outcomes.
Even if Russia were to double or triple its existing cyber operations against Ukraine, for
example, it might still not be enough to materially impact the war.
Factor 10: Russia has been distracted by the need to defend its own networks against
foreign cyber operations.
Low importance. There is a small amount of evidence that Russian offensive cyber actors
have turned some of their attention to countering cyber threats against Russia—for example,
by seeking to hack the Ukrainian IT Army that is itself hacking Russian networks.170 In
general, however, the overlap between Russian personnel, units, and capabilities that
Moscow uses for offensive versus defensive purposes may be limited.
Russian Restraint
Factor 11: Russian forces preserved Ukrainian systems for use in communication or
intelligence gathering.
Low importance. Russian cyber fires have targeted Ukrainian telecommunications systems
and supporting critical infrastructure at all stages of the war—from the disruptions of Viasat
and Ukrtelecom to the repeated attempts to interrupt electrical power. Although Russian
forces have indeed relied on Ukrainian infrastructure (such as cell service) to communicate
41/80

and collect intelligence, they have nevertheless taken no visible action to avoid kinetic strikes
on telecommunications networks and supporting infrastructure, which have sustained heavy
damage throughout the country and have required continuous repair by Ukrainian
workers.171 Ukrainian data centers and broadcast towers have also been deliberately
targeted by Russian precision strikes.172 All this suggests that—for much of the war, at least
—Moscow has had no effective, centralized plan to save Ukrainian communications
networks for Russia’s own wartime use.
Factor 12: Russian forces preserved Ukrainian infrastructure to facilitate eventual
occupation.
Low importance. Russia has deployed brutal mass bombardments and siege tactics in
many areas. In some places that have been controlled by Russia, such as Mariupol, there
were minimal efforts to restore basic services such as electricity, communications, and
medical care. This suggests that Moscow has been unconcerned with preserving Ukrainian
infrastructure—at least in much of the country—for its eventual control.
Russia may have initially planned for cyber restraint before changing its mind as the war
evolved. If so, one would expect Russian cyber fires on Ukrainian critical infrastructure to
increase in number and severity over time. Yet Russian cyber fires generally peaked in the
days and weeks surrounding the immediate invasion, implying that capacity rather than
intent has been the primary constraint. A possible counterexample is Russia’s cyber fires on
industrial control systems, which did not occur until April and July. Preparation for the July
attack apparently began no later than February, suggesting that Russia sought, at a
minimum, to develop options for industrial control system attacks as soon as the war began.
Russian Way of War
Factor 13: Russia’s cyber fires had much less psychological and political impact than
its kinetic attacks.
Moderate importance. Russian forces have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,
brutalized and terrorized civilian populations, destroyed large portions of major cities, and
displaced millions. It is difficult to imagine any cyber campaign—no matter how wellconstructed and persistent—that would meaningfully add to this societal and psychological
trauma. Nevertheless, we know little about the dynamics of Ukrainian wartime politics and
morale. Conceivably, popular Ukrainian support for continuing to prosecute the war has
depended in part on Ukrainians’ initial and continued ability to hear from their leaders,
access basic services, and communicate with family members. If so, a highly effective and
sustained campaign of cyber disruptions by Moscow could perhaps have helped force Kyiv
to the bargaining table over time. More study of these questions is warranted.
Factor 14: Russia’s kinetic targeting was too imprecise and haphazard to benefit from
cyber-derived intelligence.
42/80

Moderate importance. Russian artillery fires have usually “lack[ed] much of the C4ISTAR
[command, control, communications, computers, information/intelligence, surveillance,
targeting acquisition, and reconnaissance] coordination as envisioned by the
Reconnaissance Fire Complex and exhibit[ed] a considerable degree of systemic friction and
slowed responsiveness,” according to Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds.173 In the face of
these deficits, Russian artillery units have at times sought to overwhelm their enemy with
sheer quantity. It is therefore unclear whether cyber-derived tactical targeting intelligence—
for example, precise real-time geolocation of Ukrainian positions—could be productively
used by Russian forces. It does seem that some intelligence sources are more successful
than others. When Russians can spot Ukrainians via UAV imagery, they have directed
artillery fire much more rapidly and accurately than when EW direction finding, acoustic
reconnaissance, or radar was used.
Russia’s missile targeting process is also variable. Russia has often launched missiles
against minor military targets and more or less random civilian objects.174 In those cases,
cyber-derived intelligence would not be of much use. But missiles have sometimes struck
strategic targets, such as bases, airports, defense production facilities, transportation nodes,
and energy infrastructure. It is conceivable that cyber intelligence collection might have
sometimes provided unique targeting information—for example, revealing a hidden
dependency or vulnerability. There are a few known cases where Russian cyber operators
plausibly fed intelligence to missile targeteers, but it’s not obvious in those cases that cyber
intelligence was important. Missile targeteers would already know of most strategic Ukrainian
targets via traditional intelligence sources. Cyber intelligence would typically be a convoluted
and time-intensive way of confirming a target’s importance and identifying aimpoints
compared to, say, satellite imagery.
Factor 15: Russia’s brutal, arbitrary, neglectful, and predatory occupation forces had
limited use for cyber intelligence.
Moderate importance. Although available information is sparse, Russian forces in occupied
territory do not seem to have used sophisticated intelligence techniques to separate key
resisters from other citizens. Rather, they have more often carried out brutal and at times
indiscriminate large-scale violence, relied on physical intimidation, and neglected to restore
basic services (including internet) in many areas.175 The most notable exception is Moscow’s
move in early May to reroute internet traffic from Kherson—which Putin planned to annex—
through Russian national infrastructure, enabling Moscow to apply its own internet
regulations, surveillance, and censorship to the city.176 However, this incident serves to
highlight that physical control of telecommunications networks can enable far more systemic
surveillance than remote hacking.
Ukrainian Cyber Architecture
Factor 16: Ukraine’s national digital infrastructure was structurally resilient.

43/80

High importance. Ukraine’s national internet and IT infrastructure, even before the war, was
resilient in many ways. Researchers have identified “low market concentration at multiple
levels and the relatively high number of interconnect facilities,” meaning “there are no
obvious choke points, or individual networks whose loss would have a crippling effect on the
internet in Ukraine.”177 Moreover, the country has a thriving workforce of IT professionals and
network engineers, and this human element has proven agile, collaborative, and highly
motivated to maintain digital connectivity in the face of kinetic and cyber fires.178
Factor 17: Some key Ukrainian systems, such as military equipment, have not yet
been digitized or networked.
Low importance. There have been no reported hacks of Soviet-era Ukrainian military
equipment, much of which presumably has limited or no connectivity.179 But equally, there
have been no credible and specific reports that Ukraine’s modern, networked equipment has
been hacked. For example, Ukraine’s drone operations have proven vulnerable to Russian
jamming and EW direction finding, but field researchers have not noted any evidence of
hacking.180 Of course, Kyiv and its suppliers and allies may choose not to publicize any
successful Russian hacking of military hardware. However, it would probably be difficult to
conceal a large number of incidents with significant battlefield consequences, as
demonstrated by Ukraine’s well-documented struggles against Russian EW during some
parts of the war.
Ukrainian Cyber Defenses
Factor 18: Long-term investments in Ukraine’s cyber defense ecosystem have paid
dividends.
Moderate importance. Since roughly 2017, the United States has expanded multiple
initiatives to bolster the cybersecurity of Ukraine’s government and critical infrastructure.181
In addition, “numerous [other] foreign governments and cybersecurity companies had
invested in Ukrainian cyber capacity building over several years.”182 Ukrainian institutions
made parallel investments of their own.183 For example, one of Ukraine’s largest telecoms
companies grew its cybersecurity workforce by about two-thirds from 2015 to 2022.184 Such
investments may well have contributed to Ukraine’s wartime cyber defenses. It is suggestive
to compare the periods before and after these reforms. From 2015 to 2017, Ukraine was the
victim of three exceptionally damaging Russian cyber attacks: two electrical power
disruptions and the NotPetya attack. But from 2018 until Russia’s 2022 invasion there were
no comparably serious events, despite the ongoing Donbas conflict and occupation of
Crimea. Plausibly, the broad-based and sustained investments in Ukrainian cybersecurity led
to major improvements in the country’s cyber posture.
Factor 19: Ukraine has had many years of prior experience in monitoring and
countering Russian cyber operations.

44/80

Low importance. If persistent cyber targeting of one country by another leads defenders to
develop relative advantages over time, then this pattern would be evident around the world:
major state-sponsored cyber actors would show gradually declining efficacy against their
primary targets. This does not seem to be the case.
Factor 20: Ukraine’s “IT Army” has enabled global grassroots cyber professionals to
augment Ukrainian personnel.
Low importance. Although the IT Army was originally announced as having both defensive
and offensive missions, research suggests it soon became purely offensive in nature.185 Any
defensive benefits for Ukraine would be indirect, insofar as the IT Army’s hacking of Russian
systems caused Moscow to retask its own offensive units toward more defensively oriented
missions.186
Foreign Support to Ukraine
Factor 21: Cloud service providers helped Ukraine migrate key data to secure servers
outside of the country.
High importance. Ukraine undertook an emergency cloud migration immediately after the
Russian invasion, which Ukrainian government agencies and Western companies have
called critical to the country’s cybersecurity and digital resilience.187 Ukraine’s digital minister,
for example, said that the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform “literally saved our
digital infrastructure.”188 The need for this migration was demonstrated when Russia
reportedly damaged a Ukrainian government data center with a cruise missile attack “in the
early days of the war.”189 Kyiv said that “no data was lost because backups were available,”
though it is unclear if cloud migration was the reason; Ukraine’s governmental cloud
migration may not yet have begun in earnest at that time. In any case, cloud migration has
produced wide-scale improvement in Ukraine’s overall cybersecurity and resilience.
The migration process unfolded iteratively over several months—with economically critical
databases receiving first priority—and remained ongoing as of late July.190 While this gradual
timeline is to be expected for such an enormous and complex undertaking, it also suggests
that cloud migration cannot wholly explain Ukraine’s successful cyber defenses, particularly
in the war’s earlier stages. In fact, a cloud migration process can itself introduce various
distractions, service disruptions, and new cybersecurity vulnerabilities (such as in the
configuration and access interfaces of cloud assets), especially under the strained and
chaotic circumstances of wartime. Cloud migration has certainly enhanced Ukraine’s wartime
cybersecurity, but it is probably not the single decisive factor.
Factor 22: Cybersecurity companies provided advanced end-point security, threat
intelligence, and information sharing.

45/80

High importance. Microsoft has argued that recent innovations in end-point security, threat
intelligence, and information sharing have been some of the most important factors in
Ukrainian cyber defenses.191 For example, the company has declared that “for the first time
in a major cyber event, behavioral detections leveraging machine learning used known
attack patterns to successfully identify and stop further attacks without prior knowledge of the
underlying malware—even before humans were aware of the threats.”192 Other companies,
like AWS, have also provided close cybersecurity support to Ukraine, while threat intelligence
from Western firms and governments has helped to expose and mitigate malicious
activity.193
The impact of these efforts is difficult to judge, but their sheer scale is hard to discount. Few
if any other moments have galvanized so many of the world’s leading cybersecurity actors to
protect a single set of victims from a defined set of bad actors. (The 2020 U.S. presidential
election may be the only comparable example.) This extraordinary concentration of
cybersecurity capability presents major obstacles for even a determined and powerful
adversary like Russia. That said, considerable effort and skill would be required to properly
coordinate and leverage the cybersecurity support that Ukraine has received. More
information is needed to understand how well Ukraine has done this under trying wartime
circumstances.
Factor 23: Starlink systems bolstered the security and resilience of Ukrainian
telecoms.
High importance. Ukraine’s top cybersecurity official, Yurii Shchyhol, cited Starlink as the
most useful form of digital assistance that Ukraine has received during the war.194 Starlink
has reportedly made numerous tangible contributions to the war effort, such as enabling the
control of Ukrainian drones, helping besieged Ukrainian troops in Mariupol stay in touch with
their commanders, and facilitating Zelenskyy’s communications with world leaders and the
global public.195 Starlink’s architecture has been relatively resistant to cyber attacks and
jamming, though Elon Musk claimed in May that the Russians were “ramping up their
efforts.”196
To be sure, Starlink is not the mainstay of Ukraine’s internet. Ukrainian terrestrial
telecommunications networks, which have higher bandwidth, have proven fairly resilient
during the war, and Starlink users are advised to limit their reliance on the network because
its signals pose a risk of discovery and targeting by Russian forces.197 In early May,
Ukraine’s digital minister said that “about 150,000 Ukrainians use Starlink on a daily basis”—
less than 1 percent of the country’s population.198 But some users are more important to
Ukraine’s war effort than others. Anecdotally, front-line Ukrainian forces seem to be among
the heaviest Starlink users. They often cite Starlink as their most important channel for
command and control, and they have described outages as leading to “‘catastrophic’ loss of

46/80

communications” on the battlefield.199 Further research could investigate the extent to which
essential communications, such as government, military, and critical infrastructure data, flow
over Starlink and Ukraine’s various other telecommunications systems.
Factor 24: Ukrainians have used foreign messaging apps that Russia is unable or
unwilling to target with cyber attacks.
Moderate importance. Messaging and other communication apps—such as Signal,
Telegram, Twitter, and Zello—were widely used in Ukraine before Russia’s invasion, making
them familiar and valuable channels once the war began.200 They have long been embraced
by Ukraine’s government and media, becoming central sources of information about politics
and daily life. Russia has used these same platforms to propagandize to the Ukrainian
populace. Still, Ukraine’s continued access to familiar sources of instantaneous
communication has brought more benefits than risks to the country. For example, social
media has been an important means for Zelenskyy to reassure his people, particularly in the
war’s early days when maintaining morale was most essential. More research is needed to
understand the many effects of these platforms on the war’s progression.
Factor 25: U.S. and NATO defensive and counter-cyber operations, including “hunt
forward,” have been effective.
Unknown importance. Shchyhol has described “a constant synergy” between his
government, U.S. Cyber Command, and the National Security Agency (NSA) to secure
Ukrainian networks, “especially of government institutions and military-related
installations.”201 But there is no public information about the nature and extent of these
activities or their impact.
Conclusion
In sum, many factors have constrained Moscow’s cyber effectiveness in Ukraine. Perhaps
the most important are inadequate Russian cyber capacity, weaknesses in Russia’s noncyber institutions, and exceptional defensive efforts by Ukraine and its partners. To
meaningfully influence a war of this scale, cyber operations must be conducted at a tempo
that Russia apparently could sustain for only weeks at most. Moscow worsened its capacity
problem by choosing to maintain or even increase its global cyber activity against nonUkrainian targets, and by not fully leveraging cyber criminals as an auxiliary force against
Ukraine. Meanwhile, Putin and his military seem unwilling or unable to plan and wage war in
the precise, intelligence-driven manner that is optimal for cyber operations. Ukraine, for its
part, has benefited from a resilient digital ecosystem, years of prior cybersecurity
investments, and an unprecedented surge of cyber support from the world’s most capable
companies and governments.

What Lessons Apply to Other States’ Military Cyber Efforts?

47/80

The Russian war in Ukraine offers some general lessons for other states’ military cyber
efforts. However, it is crucial that countries consider a range of relevant case studies and
account for their own national circumstances, including the specific kinds of wars they might
need to fight in the future. Below are some high-level insights and recommendations, with
particular focus on the United States and Taiwan.
Cyber Offense
Fires. Russia’s experience suggests that cyber fires can be usefully concentrated in a
surprise attack or other major salvo, but they risk fading in relevance during larger, longer
wars. Cyber commands that hope to sustain fires at militarily relevant levels throughout a
large-scale war should be appropriately sized and designed for this daunting task. What that
means in practice isn’t clear. At a minimum, Russia’s apparent failure to mass adequate
cyber force in Ukraine should prompt other countries to reexamine the assumptions behind
their own sizing constructs. U.S. Cyber Command, for example, is still sized to its original
2012 model: about 6,200 personnel split into 133 teams, including twenty-seven Cyber
Combat Mission Teams that would have primary responsibility for wartime cyber fires (among
other tasks).202 The command plans to add fourteen more teams in the next few years, with
two new Combat Mission Teams included among the first additions.203 U.S. Cyber Command
is extremely large by global standards. Even so, it isn’t clear that the organization can
produce enough cyber fires capacity to meet expectations or needs in a major conflict,
notwithstanding modest future growth. The command has said that new teams are being
added in response to “recent demand across DoD”—presumably, peacetime and gray zone
requirements.204 Wartime needs would most likely be many times larger.
Militaries that prioritize wartime cyber fires may therefore face a difficult choice. They can opt
to maintain huge standing cyber forces at significant expense. Alternatively, they can develop
surge capacity mechanisms (drawing on reserves or civilians, for example), which are
challenging to implement and risk cannibalizing domestic cybersecurity in a crisis. Moreover,
adequate force size is necessary but insufficient to deliver meaningful wartime cyber fires.
The Russian example has also demonstrated the need for rapid regeneration of cyber
capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command, too, has sometimes struggled with force regeneration—
even under peacetime and gray zone conditions—and has therefore sought to develop
lower-cost, “burnable” tools and infrastructure.205 Such challenges would likely be far more
acute in a major war. To make the most out of limited wartime cyber capacity, militaries may
need to experiment with wave tactics: short bursts of intense cyber fires followed by periods
of stand-down and regeneration. Russia possibly employed this approach when it halted
destructive cyber attacks in the summer before resuming in October, around the same time
that Moscow intensified its missile attacks. The more infrequent the waves of cyber fires, the
more important it will be for militaries to coordinate them closely with kinetic fires.

48/80

Russia’s war in Ukraine illustrates the high bar of delivering cyber fires at the scale and pace
of major conflict. Militaries designed for large-scale war should carefully consider whether
meeting this bar is a realistic goal. If their cyber commands cannot scale dramatically and
regenerate rapidly, they should perhaps not focus on developing wartime fires in the zone of
conflict. They might instead prioritize non-fires activities such as cyber defense operations or
intelligence collection. Or they could plan for more selective war-related fires in other
theaters, as Russia has done by holding NATO countries’ networks at risk in an effort to
deter further support for Ukraine. Militaries might also de-emphasize wartime missions
entirely and invest instead in peacetime, gray zone, or prewar fires—including what the U.S.
military calls “campaigning” or “shaping” operations.
In fact, many countries may already be heading down these various alternative paths. Max
Smeets has found that, although more than forty states have established military cyber
commands, just a few have ever conducted any known cyber effects operations (fires), in
war or otherwise.206 In this global context, the U.S. military—plus a handful of its friends and
rivals—appears to have exceptionally ambitious cyber goals. Most countries should probably
not emulate U.S. Cyber Command’s bold aspiration to “deliver strategic and operational
advantages for the Joint Force . . . in conflict” by “integrat[ing] cyberspace capabilities and
forces into plans and operations across all domains.”207
Intelligence. Cyber intelligence collection may have greater overall potential than cyber fires
to support a variety of wartime military tasks. The Russian case, however, shows that
realizing this potential requires competent analysis and decisionmaking processes and a
reasonably precise “way of war.” Russian cyber operators may well have acquired more raw
data in Ukraine than could be reliably interpreted and practically used by Russian political
leaders, intelligence analysts, planners, targeteers, or occupying forces. As cyber capabilities
proliferate, more countries could face this mismatch. In such cases, broad institutional
reforms—upgrading analytic tradecraft, instilling professionalism, or combating corruption—
will often have more value than further technical investments in cyber collection. Militaries
unable to implement those reforms may find that exquisite cyber intelligence capabilities
aren’t worth the effort to develop.
In addition, cyber operations have specific strengths and weaknesses as a source of wartime
intelligence; they are not the right tool for every task. Although cyber operations can yield
unique intelligence data, they’re more time-consuming and inconsistent than many other
methods. Overhead imagery, for example, has most likely been far more important to
Russian kinetic targeteers than cyber-derived intelligence. Cyber units should be fully
integrated into all-source intelligence processes that direct them toward information needs
which cannot be readily fulfilled by other means. Wartime use cases for cyber intelligence
might include tracking high-value targets in real time, validating HUMINT in mission-critical
situations, and acquiring very large data caches with durable, multipurpose value.
Cyber Defense
49/80

Cyber defenders also have much to learn from the Russia-Ukraine war. Their first task is to
revisit assessments of enemy offensive cyber capabilities in light of Russian challenges and
limitations in Ukraine. Although some of Moscow’s struggles may be circumstantial, others
could apply more broadly. Cyber defenders should therefore consider whether they have
overestimated their respective enemies’ likely ability to use cyber operations to win a future
war against them. For example, U.S. officials have long worried that an adversary could
exploit or disrupt American weapon systems during war, and have therefore worked for years
to bolster the cybersecurity of U.S. military hardware. The Government Accountability Office
has called for a redoubling of these efforts due to continuing institutional gaps.208 Yet
Russian forces, facing many of the same U.S. systems on the Ukrainian battlefield, have
seemingly failed to compromise them in significant ways. Washington should carefully review
its intelligence, and press Kyiv for help, to validate its prior assumptions of how adversaries
will use cyber operations against U.S. systems in combat. Realistic assessments help to
avoid overinvestment in less important areas, freeing up scarce resources for higher
priorities. Cyber policymakers must differentiate between possible worst-case scenarios
(positing extreme danger) and more likely cyber events (which may not cause lasting
strategic damage).
Taiwan. Different countries should draw different cyber lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war
based on their particular military situations. Taiwan, for example, might use Ukraine’s
experience to better anticipate and defend against Chinese cyber operations during a
potential full-scale invasion. Taiwan’s plans should, of course, be rooted firmly in its own
context. This means carefully analyzing China’s cyber and kinetic forces, Taiwanese network
architecture and security, possible third-party contributions, and the political goals likely to
shape each actor’s cyber and overall military strategy. But these factors are not easy to
judge, leading to some inevitable reliance on assumptions. The war in Ukraine offers a useful
reference point for examining and refining these assumptions. Taiwanese cyber analysts and
planners should make comparisons, as well as contrasts, between the Russia-Ukraine war
and a possible China-Taiwan war.
To begin with, Russia’s inept military and political institutions have demonstrated that
effective wartime cyber operations depend on sound decisionmaking and coordination
processes. It is noteworthy, then, that Chinese President Xi Jinping has gradually eliminated
rival factions and eroded meritocracy at the top levels of Chinese leadership. Are Xi and his
yes-men likely to repeat Putin’s mistake of failing to rely on objective intelligence—including
cyber intelligence—to inform military plans? Or have Xi’s efforts to professionalize the
military and improve joint warfighting prepared China to make better use of cyber
operations?
Russian cyber capacity constraints also invite a reexamination of China’s posture. On the
one hand, Beijing probably possesses a larger military cyber force than Moscow.209 On the
other hand, China has very rarely attempted any cyber fires, whereas Russia had already
carried out many previous destructive attacks. Would China execute an even bigger and
50/80

more effective cyber salvo at the outset of a Taiwan invasion, or would it bungle the opener
due to inexperience? And what happens after that? Many observers expect a Chinese
invasion to lead to a protracted military struggle. Would Chinese cyber forces demonstrate
greater regenerative capacity than Russia, or would they likewise become less militarily
relevant over time?
Finally, Taiwan’s cyber architecture and defenses should be considered in light of the
Ukrainian experience. Taiwan has greater technical prowess than Ukraine, so would its
military and civilian communications infrastructure prove even more resilient? Or does
Taiwan’s island geography mean fewer, more vulnerable choke points—with the risks
potentially magnified by a higher overall dependence on digital technology? International
cyber assistance, so critical to Ukraine, may be Taiwan’s biggest question mark. Western
technology companies have had powerful political, reputational, and commercial motivations
to support Ukraine.210 But unlike Ukraine, Taiwan lacks a clearcut claim of sovereignty. And
compared to Russia, China has much greater economic heft and global technological
integration. Would Western companies be just as eager to help Taiwan? If so, would they be
physically able to do so without overland access?
Posing these questions is easier than answering them. But they suggest some ways that
other countries can look for cyber lessons in the Russia-Ukraine war without losing sight of
their own distinct circumstances.

Conclusion
Russia’s cyber operations in Ukraine have apparently not had much military impact. This was
probably for a multitude of reasons: Russia’s offensive limitations, as well as the defensive
efforts of Ukraine and its partners; the particular context of this war, as well as structural
features of cyberspace and warfare generally. The Russia-Ukraine war offers an important
case study of cyber operations as a wartime military instrument. Yet it is neither the first nor
the only such case study. Other militaries have previously used cyber operations, in war or
combat situations, with varied outcomes. Militaries with high capability, professionalism, and
readiness in both cyber and kinetic disciplines—such as the United States and Israel—have
leveraged cyber intelligence collection and fires to enable strikes on high-value targets, for
example.
But even top-tier militaries seem to have the greatest cyber successes in tightly
circumscribed contexts. Former U.S. secretary of defense Ashton Carter, for example, wrote
that he was “largely disappointed in Cyber Command’s effectiveness against [the selfproclaimed Islamic State]”—arguably the largest and most intense U.S. military campaign
since the maturation of American offensive cyber capabilities. According to Carter, U.S.
Cyber Command “never really produced any effective cyber weapons or techniques” in the
campaign.211

51/80

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an even larger and more ambitious military endeavor than the
U.S. campaign against the Islamic State, and it seems to reaffirm an emerging truth of
wartime cyber operations: modern wars will always feature cyber operations, but cyber
operations won’t always be important to these wars. Rather, the scale of war appears
inversely correlated with the strategic impact of cyber operations. If this correlation holds,
cyberspace should probably not be seen as a “fifth domain” of warfare equivalent in stature
to land, sea, air, and space.212

Notes
1

For the purposes of this paper, “cyber operations” refers to the hacking of computers and
digital systems, primarily by remote means (over the internet) but also when facilitated by
human agents. Related concepts—namely electronic warfare, signals intelligence, and
influence operations—are not a primary focus. While these related ideas are intertwined with
cyber operations in Russian doctrine and can be blended, this paper cannot consider them
all in depth. The paper primarily focuses on cyber operations directed or orchestrated by the
Russian state—whether ultimately carried out by military members, intelligence officers,
criminals, or others. It does not consider truly independent pro-Russian hacktivism (to the
extent such a thing exists). Nor does it evaluate Russian cyber operations conducted against
non-Ukrainian targets, though many of these (such as intelligence gathering and operational
preparation in NATO country networks, or online suppression of Russia’s own citizens) are
connected to the war. Finally, offensive cyber operations by pro-Ukraine actors, including the
United States and NATO, are also beyond the scope of this paper.

15 Joint Chiefs of Staff, “Joint Publication 3-0: Joint Operations,” October 22, 2018,

https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp3_0.pdf. The “fires” construct may or may not be how Russia
conceptualizes its own military cyber effects operations in Ukraine. This paper’s use of the
term therefore presents some risk of mirror-imaging—that is, seeing Russia through a U.S.
or Western lens, rather than as Russia sees itself. However, the paper’s primary aim is to
inform Western policymaking; mapping the Russia-Ukraine war onto Western frameworks
can help to generate insights and recommendations directly relevant to Western militaries.
Additionally, Gavin Wilde has argued that Russia’s own holistic doctrine of “information
warfare” is “overinflated” and premised on a “conspiratorial mindset” that “superimpos[es] a
linear logic to conflict and attribute[s] far more control and intentionality . . . than was ever
truly warranted.” Wilde warns Western analysts “not to conflate the self-reinforcing logic of
that concept with operational coherence, much less strategic impact.” To be sure,
Westerners must look to Russian concepts when interpreting and predicting Russian
decisions. But these concepts aren’t the only, or necessarily the best, tools for assessing the
impact of Russian actions. See Gavin Wilde, “Assess Russia’s Cyber Performance Without
Repeating Its Past Mistakes,” War on the Rocks, July 21, 2022,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/assess-russias-cyber-performance-without-repeating-itspast-mistakes/.

16 Technically, the preferred term in U.S. doctrine is “cyberspace attack,” considered “a form

of fires.” Joint Chiefs of Staff, “Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations,” June 8, 2018,
https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_12.pdf. But cyberspace attack is
unfortunately similar to the generic term “cyber attack,” a notoriously ambiguous phrase that
causes frequent miscommunication and lacks clear military connotation. This paper therefore
refers to cyber fires.

14, 2022, https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/14/russia-cyberattacks-ukrainecybersecurity-00045486.
51 Figure 1 aims to paint a very general picture of rough patterns and orders of magnitude

seen in multiple data sources; it should not be understood as quantitatively precise. To
enable side-by-side comparisons of disparate data, certain data points have been averaged
or occasionally interpolated, as explained below. This results in some loss of fidelity,
including a possible smoothing of peaks and valleys.
Microsoft data on the number of organizations attacked were assembled from three different
reports. Weeks 1-6 come from “Special Report: Ukraine,” Microsoft, April 27, 2022,
https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd. This report provided a
week-by-week victim tally, with thirty-seven organizations in total, through Week 6. The next
tranche of data comes from “Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons From the Cyber War,”
Microsoft, June 22, 2022,
https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE50KOK. This second report
provided an updated total of forty-eight victim organizations, without a week-by-week
breakdown. Assuming the report was up to date as of its release, these figures imply eleven
new victims over eleven weeks, averaged here as one attack each in Weeks 7-17.
The final Microsoft data come from Clint Watts, “Preparing for a Russian Cyber Offensive
Against Ukraine This Winter,” Microsoft, December 3, 2022, https://blogs.microsoft.com/onthe-issues/2022/12/03/preparing-russian-cyber-offensive-ukraine/. Here, Microsoft gave its
latest estimate that “roughly 50 Ukrainian organizations” had been victimized by Russian
destructive malware as of mid-October. Since late June total was already forty-eight, the midOctober total of “roughly 50” indicates no more than a few new victims during the intervening
months. The report separately described a “spike” of destructive attacks in October “after two
months of little to no wiper activity.” However, the spike would necessarily be small given the
similar June and October totals. Microsoft’s latest report did not give a full timeline of
destructive attacks since June, but it did specifically mention an October 11 ransomware
attack against two Ukrainian organizations, and an October 16 destructive attack “against
critical infrastructure along the Dniester and Dnieper rivers.” (It also mentioned other times in
October when Russia “staged” destructive malware, but Microsoft did not say these incidents
culminated in successful attacks.) Figure 1 seeks to give a rough reconciliation of all these
data points. It posits that Microsoft identified no victimized organizations between Weeks 18
and 32, two victims in Week 33 (the October 11 attack) and two more in Week 34 (an
interpretation of the October 16 attack). This brings the total number of organizations
attacked to fifty-two (or “roughly 50”).
CyberPeace Institute data come from “Timeline,” CyberPeace Institute, accessed November
13, 2022, https://cyberconflicts.cyberpeaceinstitute.org/threats/timeline. This figure includes
cyber incidents carried out by all perpetrators.
59/80

Mandiant data on the number of attacks and malware variants come from Gabby Roncone’s
and John Wolfram’s presentation at CYBERWARCON on November 10, 2022, as
documented in Dan Black, Twitter post, November 10, 2022, 11:22 a.m.,
https://twitter.com/DanWBlack/status/1590741781771354112; and Andy Greenberg,
“Russia’s New Cyberwarfare in Ukraine Is Fast, Dirty, and Relentless,” Wired, November 10,
2022, https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ukraine-cyberattacks-mandiant/. Mandiant’s
original data were broken down by month. To render these comparable to Microsoft and
CyberPeace Institute data, Mandiant numbers here have been converted to weekly
averages, which were rounded in cases when a month’s beginning/end did not land neatly
on a week’s beginning/end.
Microsoft data on destructive malware families come in part from its April 27 report. The first
date of use for each malware family is taken from the same source as well as from Pawel
Knapczyk, “Overview of the Cyber Weapons Used in the Ukraine-Russia War,” Trustwave,
August 18, 2022, https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabsblog/overview-of-the-cyber-weapons-used-in-the-ukraine-russia-war/. Microsoft’s June 22
report listed the same eight families as its April 27 report, implying that no new malware
families had emerged between Weeks 7 and 17.
52 “Statistics of Cyber Attacks on Ukrainian Critical Information Infrastructure: 15–22 March,”

State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, March 25,
2022, https://cip.gov.ua/en/news/statistika-kiberatak-na-ukrayinsku-kritichnu-informaciinuinfrastrukturu-15-22-bereznya. Zhora said that the number of attempted “attacks” was
growing, but that “most of them are unsuccessful.”
