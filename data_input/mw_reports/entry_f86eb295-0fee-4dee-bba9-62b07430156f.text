Commission (CRTC)
Yesterday, the CRTC and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) National Division
each executed a warrant at a residence located in the Greater Toronto Area. The operation
is part of an international coordinated effort with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP), the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police.
The warrants were obtained as part of ongoing parallel investigations into Remote Access
Trojan (RAT) technology. This type of malicious software (malware) enables remote access
to Canadian computers, without their users’ consent and can lead to the subsequent
installation of other malware and theft of personal information.
Tips from international private cyber security firms triggered the investigation.
The CRTC does not comment on active investigations, nor does it name the individuals or
companies under investigation. Further information will be communicated when the
investigation is concluded.
