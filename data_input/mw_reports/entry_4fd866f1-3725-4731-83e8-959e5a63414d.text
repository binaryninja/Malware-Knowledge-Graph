Another in our occasional series demystifying Latin American banking trojans
In this installment of our blog series, we will focus on Mispadu, an ambitious Latin American banking trojan
that utilizes McDonald’s malvertising and extends its attack surface to web browsers.
1/17

We believe this malware family is targeting the general public. Its main goals are monetary and credential
theft. In Brazil, we have seen it distributing a malicious Google Chrome extension that attempts to steal
credit card data and online banking data, and that compromises the Boleto payment system.

Characteristics
Mispadu is a malware family, identified during our research of Latin American banking trojans, that targets
Brazil and Mexico. It is written in Delphi and attacks its victims using the same method as the families
described earlier in this series: by displaying fake pop-up windows and trying to persuade the potential
victims to divulge sensitive information.
For its backdoor functionality, Mispadu can take screenshots, simulate mouse and keyboard actions, and
capture keystrokes. It can update itself via a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that it downloads and executes.
As with the other Latin American banking trojans, Mispadu also collects information about its victims,
namely:
OS version
computer name
language ID
whether Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application, popular in Brazil, to protect access to online
banking) is installed
list of installed common Latin American banking applications
list of installed security products
As in the cases of Amavaldo and Casbaneiro, Mispadu can also be identified by its use of a unique, custom
cryptographic algorithm to obfuscate the strings in its code. This is used in all components, as well as to
protect its configuration files and C&C communications. Figure 1 illustrates the core code implementing this
algorithm, and Figure 2 pseudocode for the algorithm.

data_dec = str()

b1 = (data_enc[i] - 0x41) * 25

6

b2 = data_enc[i+1] - 0x41 - seed - key

7

data_dec += chr(b1 + b2)

return data_dec

The banking trojan executable comes with four potentially unwanted applications stored in its resource
section. These applications are all otherwise legitimate files from Nirsoft, but have been patched to run from
the command line with no GUI. They are used by the malware to extract stored credentials from:
browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer), and
email clients (Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Windows Live Mail, among others).
Mispadu also monitors the content of the clipboard and tries to replace potential bitcoin wallets with its own,
as Casbaneiro did. However, from examining the attacker’s wallet (see Figure 3), it has not been very
successful to date.

Distribution

3/17

Mispadu employs two distribution methods: spam (see Figure 4) and malvertising. While the former method
is very common for Latin American banking trojans, the latter is not, so let’s look at it more closely. Figure 5
shows how the Mispadu attack unfolds.

Figure 4. Examples of spam emails distributing Mispadu. The one targeting Brazil (left) claims the recipient has been
absent for three package delivery attempts and should follow the URL to get a refund. The one targeting Mexico (right)
urges the recipient to download an invoice to avoid account “blockage”.

Figure 5. Mispadu’s distribution and execution chain

The threat actor placed sponsored advertisements (see Figure 6 for a Brazilian example) on Facebook
offering fake discount coupons for McDonald’s. Clicking the advertisements leads the potential victim to one
of the webpages shown in Figure 7. Regardless of a visitor’s OS, clicking the button there leads to
downloading a ZIP archive containing an MSI installer. Occasionally, this archive also contains legitimate
software such as Mozilla Firefox or PuTTY, but they are mere decoys and are not used at all.
Mispadu operators compiled two different versions of the banking trojan based on the country it attacks.
Besides that, they decided to use different installers and subsequent stages for each attacked country.
However, the logic of both chains is the same and we describe that general form below.

5/17

Figure 6. Facebook ads set up by the Mispadu operators leading to fake McDonald’s coupon websites (translation of
the ad title: “Use them on any September day! Independence coupons. Get yours now”)

Figure 7. Malicious webpages offering fake discount coupons for McDonald’s Brazil (left) and Mexico (right)
(translation of the main text of both: “This coupon can be used only once. I want! / Generate coupon”)

When the potential victim executes the MSI installer, a chain of three subsequent VBS scripts follows. The
first script (unpacker) decrypts and executes the second script (downloader) from its internal data, as seen
in Figure 8. The downloader script retrieves the third script (loader) and executes it (see Figure 9).

6/17

Figure 8. Mispadu distribution chain unpacker script (stage 1). Notice the key is calculated in variable w2 to the value
95.

Figure 9. Mispadu distribution chain downloader script (stage 2). Notice the hardcoded key is the same as in the
previous stage.

The loader script is more complicated than the first two stages. It is locale-specific; it checks the language
identifier of the potential victim machine to verify it really comes from the country targeted by the current
campaign (Brazil or Mexico, respectively). It can detect some virtual environments as well; if a virtual
environment is detected or the desired locale is not found, the loader quits.
Otherwise, the loader script continues by setting up configuration files (described in detail later) and
downloading (i) a Mispadu banking trojan, (ii) an injector (DLL) used to execute it and (iii) legitimate support
DLLs. Each file is downloaded in a separate ZIP archive as illustrated in Figure 5. We provide pseudocode
for the decryption algorithm in Figure 10.

def decrypt_payload(data_enc):

key = data_enc[0]

data_dec = str()

for i in range(1, len(data_enc)):

5

data_dec += chr(data_enc[i] - ((key + i - 1) % 10))

6

return data_dec

Figure 10. Pseudocode of Mispadu’s payload decryption algorithm

Mispadu’s download servers check the validity of requests they receive. Sending an invalid request results
in an obscene image response we cannot reproduce here.
Finally, the loader script sets up persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and executing the
injector. This is done via rundll32.exe by calling an exported function of the injector DLL whose name comes
from one of the previously set up configuration files. The injector locates the encrypted banking trojan, then
decrypts and executes it.
We found an open directory on one of the servers Mispadu uses, and files connected to a very similar
campaign were stored there. Those files can be used to set up a webpage imitating AreaVIP (a tabloid
website in Brazil) and to force a fake Adobe Flash Player update on its potential victims. We have not
observed that campaign in the wild and believe it may be a setup for the future.
Since the Mispadu campaign targeting Brazil used the Tiny.CC URL shortener, we were able to gather
statistics. As seen in Figure 11, this campaign produced almost 100,000 clicks, exclusively from Brazil. The
clicks originating from Android are most likely the result of the fact that the advertisement is shown on
Facebook regardless of the user’s device. You can also see that the campaign is recurring – one phase
ended in the second half of September 2019 and emerged again at the beginning of October 2019.

Sharing an email attachment
Both spam emails and the fake McDonald’s website are interesting in one more aspect: from where the fake
coupon is downloaded. Mispadu’s operators abused the Russian Yandex.Mail platform to store their payload
(see Figure 12). The most probable scenario is that the operators created an account on Yandex.Mail, sent
an email with the malicious coupon as an attachment to themselves and then pointed the potential victim to
a direct link to this attachment.

Configuration
The use of configuration files is quite uncommon among Latin American banking trojans; yet, overall,
Mispadu utilizes three different ones and it cannot function without them. All of the configuration files are
either contained in, or obtained by, the loader script described earlier.
Mispadu’s execution configuration is stored solely in memory with data downloaded from one of its
download servers (Remote server 1 in Figure 5). It contains three crucial pieces of information:
a string necessary to create the URL to download the injector
the name of the folder where the malware will be installed
the name of the injector’s exported function to be called in order for it to execute the banking trojan
General configuration data are dropped to C:\Users\Public\%COMPUTERNAME%[1], being named as the
second letter in the victim’s computer name (so for a computer named “JOHN-PC”, the file would be named
“O”). It is created from data contained in the loader script and in the execution configuration file and contains
the version information, cryptographic key and file system paths.
C&C configuration data are stored to a file in the same location as the previous one under the same
filename with “_” appended (“O_”, to continue the previous example). It consists of:
#ip# (a placeholder for an IP address the banking trojan uses to receive backdoor commands)
#wp[1-3]# (placeholders for 3 ports associated with #ip#)
two lists of 31 domains each (main list and backup list)
Mispadu chooses its main and backup C&C domains from these lists based on the current day of the
month. It then tries to obtain an updated version of the C&C configuration file from that domain every few
hours and replaces the dropped one with it. We believe the main idea behind this approach is to fill in the
placeholders in order to activate the backdoor functionality.

Protect your Chrome
It’s a good idea, just don’t do it with the malicious Google Chrome browser extension we have observed
being distributed together with the Mispadu banking trojan in Brazil (see Figure 13). The extension (see
Figure 14 is named “Securty [sic] System 1.0” and claims to help you “Protege seu Chrome” (translation:
“Protect your Chrome”). It consists of three malicious JavaScript files that we describe below.

10/17

Figure 13. Part of Mispadu’s distribution chain that changes when the malicious Google Chrome extension is
distributed as well. The rest of the distribution chain remains the same.

Figure 14. The malicious Google Chrome extension installed by Mispadu

Component 1: Manipulating windows
This simple component has only a single functionality: it creates a new Google Chrome window and closes
all others. This component was not present in all samples we analyzed and we believe it is still in the testing
phase.

Component 2: Stealing credit card data
The second component contains a hardcoded list of websites. In pages served from these sites, it looks for
any input field containing “text”, “email”, “tel”, “number”, “password” or “radio”. If “CVV”, “CÓD SEG” or their
variants are found anywhere on the website, the content of those input fields is sent to the attacker when
the victim submits the information. This clearly reveals the intention of this part of the extension – theft of
credit card data.

Component 3: Stealing banking and Boleto data
The third component is the most advanced one. First, using a DGS-like algorithm, it generates two strings
based on current day of month and month number. Those strings are then used to form a GitHub URL in the
form of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/%FIRST_STRING%/w/master/%SECOND_STRING%,
where %FIRST_STRING% is a GitHub username. Data downloaded from the generated URL are decrypted
into a different URL we will call payload URL.

11/17

This component also contains a hardcoded list of targeted websites, as the previous one did. If the victim
visits one of these websites, a malicious JavaScript file specific to that website is obtained from the payload
URL and dynamically loaded via JavaScript’s eval function.
Besides that, this component also attempts to compromise the use of Boleto, a popular payment system
common in Brazil. The system has been an attractive target for attackers for a long time (you can read more
in this paper from 2014). To pay using this system, you have to print a ticket (boleto). That contains mainly
an ID number specific to the bank account that should receive the payment, and a barcode (see Figure 15).
Payment is then done by either scanning the barcode or typing the ID number manually.

Figure 15. An example of a boleto (source: Wikipedia)

Using a regular expression, the malware component tries to find the ID number and replace it with the
attacker’s (obtained dynamically). Additionally, it abuses a legitimate website to generate the payment
barcode using the attacker’s account number and replaces the legitimate one with that. The part of the code
responsible for compromising Boleto is shown in Figure 16.

number is marked in red, malicious barcode generation in green.

Differences between campaigns
Besides the already mentioned differences and the obvious fact that each variant of the Mispadu banking
trojan targets a different set of banks dependent on country of residence, the Brazilian campaign differs from
the Mexican one in several other minor aspects.
It seems to randomize the file system paths and filenames where configuration files are stored and the
banking trojan is installed for each victim. Additionally, the loader script contains a part that is not used at
the time of writing but that is ready to abuse Windows mshta.exe to execute the actual banking trojan
instead of rundll.exe.

Conclusion
In this blog post, we have talked about Mispadu, another Latin American banking trojan family isolated
during our research. We have shown its main characteristics including reasons why we consider it a Latin
American banking trojan – it is written in Delphi, targets Brazil and Mexico, uses pop-up windows and
contains backdoor functionality.

13/17

We have described its most recent distribution chain and focused on some interesting aspects like
Yandex.Mail being abused to store the malicious payloads and the usage of malicious Facebook ads. We
have analyzed the configuration files used by Mispadu as well.
Finally, we have talked about a malicious Google Chrome extension that we have seen Mispadu distributing
in Brazil. This extension’s goal is to steal credit card information, sensitive banking information and attempt
to steal money from its victims by compromising the Boleto payment system in Brazil.
