Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, a Canadian man charged by the US for his involvement in
NetWalker ransomware attacks, was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison after
pleading guilty before an Ontario judge to multiple offenses linked to attacks on 17
Canadian victims.
On Monday, the judge said that, although Desjardins cooperated with the authorities to help
identify victims and their losses, he still "played a dominant, almost exclusive, role in these
offenses," aggravated by an unrelated drug trafficking criminal record and a prior sentence
of 54 months imprisonment in Quebec.

The FBI discovered Desjardins's true identity after linking email accounts (Microsoft, Gmail,
and Protonmail) he used to register accounts on XSS.is and HackForums with online
activity (searches and emails) with various online services (including MEGA and ZoomInfo)
he used to upload files stolen from victims' networks and find financial info on his victims.
He also made it easier by sharing personal information on public forums, including that he
worked as an IT technician for the Canadian government (Public Works and Government
Services Canada) for more than four years.

Tens of millions in losses
The attacks Desjardins participated in resulted in losses of millions of dollars after the
victims had data stolen from their networks and were extorted into paying millions worth of
cryptocurrency as ransoms.
"Between May 2020 and January 2021, the Defendant victimized 17 Canadian entities and
others throughout the world by breaching private computer networks and systems, hijacking their data, holding the stolen data for ransom, and distributing stolen data when
ransoms were not paid," the judge added.
The US Department of Justice said in January 2021 that Desjardins allegedly obtained
more than $27.6 million after multiple successful attacks and extortion attempts since April
2020, when he first took up his new ransomware affiliate role.
"The Defendant admitted to investigators that over 1,200 Bitcoins related to his NetWalker
malware activities passed through his e-wallet and were shared with his unindicted coconspirators and the developer of the NetWalker ransomware," the judge said on Monday.
"As well, the Defendant admits that his entire ransomware activities involved over 2000
Bitcoins. The [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] RCMP seized slightly less than 720 Bitcoins
from the Defendant’s e-wallets and accounts."
Besides the 719.99591411 BTC seized from the Desjardins' BTC wallet in January 2021,
according to a restraining order filed in January 2022, the police also seized
15.725489349111 XMR from a Monero wallet, CAD $299,150 from his residence, and over
CAD $330,000 from several deposit boxes at National Bank of Canada held in his name.
After searching his home, law enforcement also seized many devices containing
approximately 20 TB of data that, "if printed, would fill an entire hockey arena."

Netwalker ransomware operation sites seized
On January 27, 2021, when the US DOJ charged Desjardins, law enforcement from the
USA and Bulgaria also seized dark websites associated with the Netwalker ransomware
operation, including their Tor payment and data leak sites.

The seizure was the result of a joint investigation conducted by the FBI, the US DOJ, the
Bulgarian National Investigation Service, and Bulgaria's General Directorate Combating
Organized Crime.
Netwalker was a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that surfaced in late 2019,
enlisting affiliates to deploy the ransomware in return for a 60-75% share of all ransom
payments.
This ransomware operation was immensely profitable for all the threat actors involved,
seeing that an August 2020 report estimated that they collected $25 million from victims
within just five months.
Some of the high-profile victims Netwalker targeted over the years include the Enel Group,
Equinix, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), the Argentian immigration
agency, and K-Electric.
However, Netwalker affiliates were never picky. They also attacked and attempted to extort
other private and public organizations, including hospitals, law enforcement organizations,
emergency services, municipalities, school districts, colleges, and universities.
