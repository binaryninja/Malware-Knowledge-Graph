University Targeted Credential Phishing Campaigns Use COVID-19, Omicron Themes

2/7

Proofpoint researchers have identified an increase in email threats targeting mostly North
American universities attempting to steal university login credentials. The threats typically
leverage COVID-19 themes including testing information and the new Omicron variant.
Proofpoint observed COVID-19 themes impacting education institutions throughout the
pandemic, but consistent, targeted credential theft campaigns using such lures targeting
universities began in October 2021. Following the announcement of the new Omicron variant
in late November, the threat actors began leveraging the new variant in credential theft
campaigns.
Threat actors continue to use COVID-19 theme lures in campaigns targeting multiple
industries and geographic areas. The threats specifically targeting universities is interesting
due to the specificity in targeting and effort to mimic legitimate login portals. It is likely this
activity will increase in the next two months as colleges and universities provide and require
testing for students, faculty, and other workers traveling to and from campus during and after
the holiday season, and as the Omicron variant emerges more widely.
We expect more threat actors will adopt COVID-19 themes given the introduction of the
Omicron variant. This assessment is based on previously published research that identified
COVID-19 themes making a resurgence in email campaigns
following the emergence of the Delta variant in August 2021.

Campaign Details
The COVID-19 themed campaigns including Omicron variant lures include thousands of
messages targeted to dozens of universities in North America.

The phishing emails contain attachments or URLs for pages intended to harvest credentials
for university accounts. The landing pages typically imitate the university’s official login
portal, although some campaigns feature generic Office 365 login portals. In some cases,
such as the Omicron variant lures, victims are redirected to a legitimate university
communication after credentials are harvested. Proofpoint observed this threat actor pivot
from Delta variant themed email lures to Omicron themes following the announcement of the
new variant.
Emails with URLs use subjects such as:
Attention Required - Information Regarding COVID-19 Omicron Variant - November 29
With a link to a spoofed landing page such as:

Messages distributing attachments included subject lines such as “Covid Test”.

Proofpoint has identified multiple threat clusters using COVID-19 themes to target
universities using different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In addition to multiple
delivery methods – Proofpoint has observed both URL and attachments in campaigns –
activity clusters use different sender and hosting methods to distribute credential theft
campaigns.
In the Omicron variant campaign, threat actors leverage actor-controlled infrastructure to
host credential theft webpages using similar domain naming patterns. These include:
sso[.]ucmo[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/Covid19/authenticationedpoint.html
sso2[.]astate[.]edu[.]boring[.]cf/login/authenticationedpoint.html
Attachment-based campaigns have leveraged legitimate but compromised WordPress
websites to host credential capture webpages, including:

In some campaigns, threat actors attempted to steal multifactor authentication (MFA)
credentials, spoofing MFA providers such as Duo. Stealing MFA tokens enables the attacker
to bypass the second layer of security designed to keep out threat actors who already know
a victim’s username and password.

While many messages are sent via spoofed senders, Proofpoint has observed threat actors
leveraging legitimate, compromised university accounts to send COVID-19 themed threats. It
is likely the threat actors are stealing credentials from universities and using compromised
mailboxes to send the same threats to other universities.
Proofpoint does not attribute this activity to a known actor or threat group, and the ultimate
objective of the threat actors is currently unknown.
