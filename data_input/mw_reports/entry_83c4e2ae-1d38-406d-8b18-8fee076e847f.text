You may remember that in autumn 2019 we published a story about how a COMpfun successor
known as Reductor infected ﬁles on the ﬂy to compromise TLS trafﬁc. If you’re wondering whether
the actor behind the malware is still developing new features, the answer is yes. Later in
November 2019 our Attribution Engine revealed a new Trojan with strong code similarities.
Further research showed that it was obviously using the same code base as COMPFun.

What’s of interest inside
The campaign operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities, this time in Europe, and
spread the initial dropper as a spoofed visa application. It is not clear to us exactly how the
malicious code is being delivered to a target. The legitimate application was kept encrypted inside
the dropper, along with the 32- and 64-bit next stage malware.

Overall infection chain. Interestingly, C2 commands are rare HTTP status codes
We observed an interesting C2 communication protocol utilizing rare HTTP/HTTPS status codes
(check IETF RFC 7231, 6585, 4918). Several HTTP status codes (422-429) from the Client Error
class let the Trojan know what the operators want to do. After the control server sends the status
“Payment Required” (402), all these previously received commands are executed.

The authors keep the RSA public key and unique HTTP ETag in encrypted conﬁguration data.
Created for web content caching reasons, this marker could also be used to ﬁlter unwanted
requests to the C2, e.g., those that are from network scanners rather than targets. Besides the
aforementioned RSA public key to communicate with the C2, the malware also uses a selfgenerated AES-128 key.

Who is the author?
We should mention here once again that the COMPfun malware was initially documented by GDATA in 2014; and although the company did not identify which APT was using the malware.
Based mostly on victimology, we were able to associate it with the Turla APT with medium-to-low
level of conﬁdence.

What the Trojan is able to do
Its functions include the ability to acquire the target’s geolocation, gathering host- and networkrelated data, keylogging and screenshots. In other words, it’s a normal full-ﬂedged Trojan that is
also capable of propagating itself to removable devices.
As in previous malware from the same authors, all the necessary function addresses resolve
dynamically to complicate analysis. To exﬁltrate the target’s data to the C2 over HTTP/HTTPS,
the malware uses RSA encryption. To hide data locally, the Trojan implements LZNT1
compression and one-byte XOR encryption.

Initial dropper
The ﬁrst stage dropper was downloaded from the LAN shared directory. The ﬁle name related to
the visa application process perfectly corresponds with the targeted diplomatic entities. As with all
modules with a similar code base, the dropper begins by dynamically resolving all the required
Windows API function addresses and puts them into structures. It then decrypts the next stage
malware from its resource (.rsrc) section. The algorithm used to decrypt the next stage is a onebyte XOR using the key “0x55”, followed by LZNT1 decompression.

The dropper urges users to run the ﬁle as administrator (using messages such as “need to run as
admin”), then drops a version corresponding to the host’s architecture and sets the ﬁle system
timestamp to 2013.12.20 22:31.
Interestingly, the dropper’s abilities aren’t limited to PE lures; as an alternative, this stage is also
able to use .doc and .pdf ﬁles. In such cases, the dropper will open the ﬁles using the “open” shell
command instead of running the legitimate spoofed executable application.

Multi-threaded Trojan features such as monitoring USB devices to spread further and
receiving commands as HTTP status codes

Initialization
As usual in this malware family’s code, a huge number of short standalone functions return all the
readable strings. This is done to complicate analysis by not allowing the strings to be visible at a
glance for researchers. The module’s preparation stage dynamically resolves all required
Windows API function addresses into corresponding custom structures. Afterwards the malware
uses indirect function calls only.
The module obtains the processor architecture (32- or 64-bit) and Windows OS version. It
includes a number of anti-analysis checks for virtual machine-related devices (VEN_VMWARE,
VBOX_HARDDISK, Virtual_DVD_ROM, etc.) to avoid controlled execution. It also notes which
security products are running on the host (Symantec, Kaspersky, Dr.Web, Avast).
Before every communication with the C2, the malware checks if software such as debuggers
(WinDbg, OllyDbg, Visual Studio) and host (Process Explorer or Monitor, etc.) or network
monitoring (Wireshark, TCPView, etc.) programs are running. It also checks for internet
connectivity and does not attempt to communicate if the checks fail.
The DLL also checks for potentially available launch processes that it can inject itself into. In the
case of PaymentRequired, this could be system, security product or browser processes. Then the
malware forms the corresponding code to drop ﬁles, delete ﬁles, etc.

The last step in the initialization procedure is to decrypt and decompress the conﬁguration ﬁle.
Decryption is done via a one-byte XOR using the 0xAA key, followed by decompression using the
LZNT1 algorithm. From the conﬁguration, the malware parses the RSA public key, ETag and IP
addresses to communicate with its control servers.

Decrypted conﬁguration data contains an RSA public key to encrypt exﬁltrated data, C2
IPs and unique ETag to communicate with them

HTTP status-based communication module
Firstly, the module generates the following:
AES-128 encryption key used in HTTP GET/POST parameters and HTTP status code 427
(request new command);
4-byte unique hardware ID (HWID) based on the host network adapters, CPU and ﬁrst ﬁxed
logical drive serial number.
The module then chooses a process to inject the code into, in order of decreasing priority, starting
from Windows (cmd.exe, smss.exe), security-related applications (Symantec’s nis.exe, Dr.Web’s
spideragent.exe) and browsers (IE, Opera, Firefox, Yandex browser, Chrome).
The main thread checks if the C2 supports TLS in its conﬁguration. If it does, communication will
be over HTTPS and port 443; otherwise, the HTTP protocol and port 80 are used.

Decrypted conﬁguration content inside the analyzed sample
The ﬁrst GET request sent contains an ETag “If-Match” header that is built using data from its
decrypted conﬁguration. ETags are normally used by web servers for caching purposes in order
to be more efﬁcient and save bandwidth by not resending redundant information if an ETag value
matches. The implementation of ETags means the C2 may ignore all requests that are not sent
from its intended targets if they don’t have the required ETag value.

Removable device propagation module
If initialization is successful, the malware starts one more thread for dispatching Windows
messages, looking for removable devices related to a WM_DEVICECHANGE event. The module
runs its own handlers in the event of a USB device being plugged into or unplugged from the
host.

Other spying modules: keylogger, screenshot tool and more
The user’s activity is monitored using several hooks. All of them gather the target’s data
independently of any C2 command. Keystrokes are encrypted using the RSA public key stored in
the conﬁguration data and sent once every two seconds, or when moreа than 512 bytes are
recorded. These 512 characters also include left mouse button clicks (written as the “MSLBTN”
string) and Windows title bar texts. For clipboard content, the module calculates an MD5 hash
and if it changes, encrypts the clipboard content with the same RSA public key and then sends it.
In a separate thread, the Trojan takes a bitmap screenshot using the GDIPlus library, compresses
it with the LZNT1 algorithm, encrypts it using the key from the conﬁguration data and sends it to
the control server. A screenshot will be taken of the target and sent anyway, independently of any
C2 command.

Last but not least
There are several choices – albeit not major additional technical ones – that the malware author
made which we consider to be noteworthy.
The COM-hijacking-based persistence method injects its corresponding code and structure as a
parameter into a legitimate process’s memory. The malware geolocates victims using legitimate
web services: geoplugin.net/json.gp, ip-api.com/json and telize.com/geoip.
The unusual thread synchronization timeout calculation in the HTTP status thread is peculiar.
Mathematically, the partial sum of the series is precisely:
This series, in the case of a full sum, is just a
representation of the exponent. The developers
probably used the exponent to make timeouts in the
communication thread more unpredictable and grow at
a fast rate, and the compiler calculated it this way.

So what did the COMPFun authors achieve?

We saw innovative approaches from the COMpfun developers twice in 2019. First, they bypassed
TLS encrypted trafﬁc via PRNG system function patching, and then we observed a unique
implementation of C2 communications using uncommon HTTP status codes.
The malware operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities and the choice of a visa-related
application – stored on a directory shared within the local network – as the initial infection vector
worked in their favor. The combination of a tailored approach to their targets and the ability to
generate and execute their ideas certainly makes the developers behind COMPFun a strong
offensive team.
