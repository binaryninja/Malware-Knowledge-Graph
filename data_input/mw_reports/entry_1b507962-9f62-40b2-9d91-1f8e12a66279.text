Foxconn electronics giant suffered a ransomware attack at a Mexican facility over the
Thanksgiving weekend, where attackers stole unencrypted files before encrypting devices.
Foxconn is the largest electronics manufacturing company globally, with recorded revenue
of $172 billion in 2019 and over 800,000 employees worldwide. Foxconn subsidiaries
include Sharp Corporation, Innolux, FIH Mobile, and Belkin.
BleepingComputer has been tracking a rumored Foxconn ransomware attack that occurred
over the Thanksgiving weekend.
Today, the DoppelPaymer ransomware published files belonging to Foxconn NA on their
ransomware data leak site. The leaked data includes generic business documents and
reports but does not contain any financial information or employee's personal details.

Sources in the cybersecurity industry have confirmed that Foxconn suffered an attack
around November 29th, 2020, at their Foxconn CTBG MX facility located in Ciudad Juárez,
Mexico.
This facility opened in 2005 and is used by Foxconn for assembly and shipping of
electronics equipment to all regions in South and North America.
"Our 682,000 square ft building was established back in 2005, and is located in Ciudad
Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. [..] Foxconn CTBG
MX is strategically located to support all Americas region," the Foxconn CTBG MX web
page describes the facility.
Since the attack, the facility's web site has been down and currently shows an error to

In an interview with DoppelPaymer, the ransomware gang confirmed that they attacked
Foxconn's North America facility on November 29th but did not attack the whole company.
As part of this attack, the threat actors claim to have encrypted about 1,200 servers, stole
100 GB of unencrypted files, and deleted 20-30 TB Of backups.
"We encrypted NA segment, not whole foxconn, it's about 1200-1400 servers, and not
focused on workstations. They also had about 75TB's of misc backups, what we were able
to - we destroyed (approx 20-30TB)," DoppelPayment told us about the attack.
In a statement to BleepingComputer, Foxconn confirmed the attack and said they are slowly
bringing their systems back into service.
"We can confirm that an information system in the US that supports some of our operations
in the Americas was the focus of a cybersecurity attack on November 29. We are working
with technical experts and law enforcement agencies to carry out an investigation to

determine the full impact of this illegal action and to identify those responsible and bring
them to justice."
"The system that was affected by this incident is being thoroughly inspected and being
brought back into service in phases," Foxconn told BleepingComputer.
Other victims attacked by DoppelPaymer in the past include Compal, PEMEX (Petróleos
Mexicanos), the City of Torrance in California, Newcastle University, Hall County in
Georgia, Banijay Group SAS, and Bretagne Télécom.
