capabilities to include multiple cloud and non-cloud services.

Keeping secrets safe is key to keeping systems secure and preventing supply-chain attacks. Malicious
actors often go after secrets in storage mechanisms and harvest credentials found in compromised
systems. And credentials stored in plain text that are accessible even without user interaction are not
uncommon for DevOps software and are therefore a big security risk.
Malicious actors have been known to harvest cloud service provider (CSP) credentials once they get into
their victims’ systems. The cybercriminal group TeamTNT, for example, is no stranger to targeting cloud
containers, expanding their arsenal to steal cloud credentials, and exploring other environments and
intrusive activities. In the group’s latest attack routine, we found new evidence that TeamTNT has further
extended its credential harvesting capabilities to target multiple cloud and non-cloud services in victims’
internal networks and systems post-compromise.
Technical analysis

1/4

Figure 1. TeamTNT’s infection chain for harvesting credentials
TeamTNT’s malware is designed to harvest credentials from specific software and services. It infects
Linux machines with openings such as exposed private keys and recycled passwords, and focuses on
checking the infected systems for cloud-related files.
As in the group’s other attacks, cloud misconfigurations and reused passwords provide easy entry to a
victim system. And as before, the group harvests credentials for Secure Shell (SSH) and Server Message
Block (SMB) to obtain access to other systems. Both intrusion techniques can spread their respective
payloads in a wormlike manner. We found several scripts for this function (to ensure the spread of
payloads in different environments), one of which we had previously documented.
With a .netrc file to automatically log in using the harvested credentials, the malware looks for app
configurations and data based on a search list while going through the connected systems, and sends
them to the command-and-control (C&C) server.

Figure 3. Checking

whether any of the configuration files of targeted services are present in the infected system
If at least one of the sought-after configuration files is present in the infected system, the extended
credential harvester aggregates all the services’ configuration files into two arrays. Comparing this
harvester with the group’s previous versions, we saw a significant increase in targets.

As TeamTNT’s payloads focus on unauthorized mining of Monero, it’s no surprise that the malware also
looks for Monero configuration files in the infected system. The malware looks for the presence of Monero
wallets in all the systems the group can access.
At the end of its routine, the malware tries to delete traces of itself from the infected system. However, our
analysis strongly indicates that this is not done effectively. While “history -c” clears the Bash history, some
commands continue with their activities and leave traces on other parts of the system.

Conclusion

3/4

Malicious actors actively look for legitimate users’ credentials in internal networks and systems to
facilitate their post-intrusion activities. If in possession of CSP credentials, they could use the cloud
services paid by legitimate entities for other malicious activities. Stolen credentials for version control
software such as Git also pose significant security risks, including supply chain compromise, since it is
highly likely that a malicious user will also have write capability into repositories, and can therefore
perform source code modifications that will go unnoticed.
In addition, credentials stored in plain text serve as a gold mine for cybercriminals, especially when used
in subsequent attacks. Harvested FTP credentials, for example, could lead to old-school website hacking
or credential modifications, followed by ransom demands in exchange for access or data restoration. The
same goes for vulnerabilities, especially those in unpatched and otherwise unsecured internet-facing
systems.
To mitigate the risks of this TeamTNT routine and other similar threats, customers are advised to use the
secret vaults offered by their CSPs and to follow these best practices:
Enforce the principle of least privilege and adopt the shared responsibility model.
Replace default credentials with strong and secure passwords, and ensure that security settings of
different systems’ environments are customized to the organization’s needs.
Avoid storing credentials in plain text, and enable multifactor authentication whenever available.
Update and patch systems regularly. Consider the security, customization of credentials, and
patching of front-facing systems to ensure no gaps can be abused for malicious activities.
