1/7

EDITOR'S NOTE: The previous version of this blog post mis-identified the source of this
attack as the FIN7 group; GRIFFON and OSTAP are both very long javascripts that have
many similarities. This caused the confusion in identifying the attack as coming from FIN7.
This is still an important find though, as Trickbot is one of the most advanced malware
frameworks.
Over the past few weeks, Morphisec Labs researchers identified a couple dozen documents
that execute the OSTAP javascript downloader.
This time we have identified the use of the latest version of the remote desktop activeX
control class that was introduced for Windows 10. The attackers utilize the activeX control for
automatic execution of the malicious Macro following an enable of the Document content.
As newer features are introduced to a constantly updating OS, so too the detection
vendors need to update their techniques to protect the system. This may become very
exhausting and time--consuming work, which can lead to the opposite effect of pushing
defenders even farther behind the attacker. Trickbot distributors have yet again taken
advantage of the opportunity this change presents.
While tracing this group abusing the remote activeX control we also identified other groups
misusing the same and earlier controls although with a slightly different technique.

Technical details
Document
Most of the targeted documents were following the naming convention "i<7-9 random
digits>.doc", as each document usually contained an image to convince targets to enable the
content. This leads to the execution of the malicious macro, only this time the image also hid
an ActiveX control slightly below it. The malicious OSTAP JavaScript downloader is then
hidden in white colored letters in between the content, so it’s not visible to people but can be
seen by machines.

2/7

Examining the activeX control revealed the use of the MsRdpClient10NotSafeForScripting
class (which is used for remote control). The Server field is empty in the script, which will
later cause an error that the attackers will actually abuse to properly execute their own code.

Macro

3/7

Inspection of the macro revealed an interesting trigger method -- “<name>_OnDisconnected”
-- which will be the main function that is first executed. This method didn’t execute
immediately as it takes time for it to try and resolve DNS to an empty string and then return
an error. The OSTAP will not execute unless the error number matches exactly to
"disconnectReasonDNSLookupFailed" (260); the OSTAP wscript command is concatenated
with a combination of characters that are dependent on the error number calculation.

Going over the documentation for the msrdpclient10 reveals that it will not work on
workstations that are not updated to windows 10.

4/7

As soon as OSTAP is created in the form of a BAT file, this file is executed, and the word
document form is closed.

GRIFFON

The BAT will execute wscript back with its own content -- an old trick using comments that
the BAT will disregard during the execution of wscript (non-recognized command) while
skipped together with its content when executed by wscript (or any other interpreter that
adheres to the comments syntax).
5/7

As soon as the JavaScript is beautified, we get back to the same old GRIFFON obfuscation
pattern.

Conclusions
Updating your operating system is necessary for better security, even though it doesn’t
always serve that purpose. This example with OSTAP makes it clear that this doesn’t always
work. Even with an updated OS, there remains a need for preventive measures such as
attack surface reduction, moving target defense, and hardening.
There are hundreds more objects that have been introduced in the latest Windows 10 and
even dozens more methods in the described object that sophisticated attackers can abuse.
There might also be opportunities for vulnerability exploitation with every new feature but this
is not in the scope of this blog post.
