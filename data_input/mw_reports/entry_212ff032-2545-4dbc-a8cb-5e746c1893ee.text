Malware Variant Delivering Cobalt Strike Beacons via Spam Campaigns
Researchers discovered that Matanbuchus, a malware loader, was available on Russian-speaking
cybercrime forums for a rental price of $2500 from February 2021.
Recently, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post where a researcher observed this malware
spreading through spam campaigns. Additionally, it downloads Cobalt Strike Beacons as payloads in
compromised systems. Figure 1 shows the infection chain of the Matanbuchus malware.

Figure 1 – Infection

Chain of Matanbuchus
The Matanbuchus infection starts through spam emails containing a ZIP attachment. This ZIP attachment
contains an HTML file.

Figure 2 – Spam Email with ZIP Attachment

Upon executing the HTML file, it decodes the base64 content embedded in the file and drops a ZIP file in
the Downloads folder.
However, there is a code present in the HTML file which shows that the ZIP file is in the OneDrive location,
as shown below.

Figure 3 – ZIP Attachment in HTML Page

The ZIP file contains an MSI installer file. After extraction, it shows a fake error message upon the
execution of the MSI file, as shown below.

Figure 4 – Adobe Fake Error Message

However, in the background, the MSI installer drops a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and VBS file in the
following locations.

2/9

C:\Users\<Admin>\AppData\Local\AdobeFontPack\main.dll
C:\Users\<Admin>\AppData\Local\AdobeFontPack\notify.vbs
The malware uses the VBS file to show fake error messages.

Additionally, the malware downloads another DLL file with an NLS extension from
https[:]//telemetrysystemcollection[.]com in the below location. C:\Users\<Admin>\AppData\Local\x86\
<4-digit Hex Value>.nls
The downloaded file is a copy of main.dll, which is another way to get the latest version of this malware
from the remote server.

Figure 6 – Dropped Copy of Malware

DLL File with .nls Extension
After dropping the DLL files, the MSI file launches regsvr32.exe and loads the malicious main.dll file to
download the actual Matanbuchus malware.
The below figure shows the process chain of the MSI file.

Technical Analysis
We have taken the below sample hash for analysis :
(SHA256), 14debc481aa0a26d3a0bdeed0e56b3ae9e301220f2606aae624d57a9d0617d6f
We found that the malicious binary is a 32-bit DLL file based on static analysis.
The main function of dropped DLL files (main.dll) is to act as a loader and download the actual
Matanbuchus DLL from the C&C server.
Before downloading the DLL file , it calls APIs such as IsProcessorFeaturePresent(),
GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() , IsDebuggerPresent(), QueryPerformanceCounter() and cpuid to ensure
that the malware is not running under a controlled environment such as VMware, Sandbox, etc.

3/9

Figure 8 – Anti-debug Check

The malware executes an export function called HackCheck(), which runs a decryption loop on encrypted
strings and prints the output using the OutputDebugStringA() API. The below figure shows the encrypted
string and decryption code.

Figure 9 – HackCheck Function

To establish persistence, the malware creates a scheduled task to run the 8c01.nls file with a specific
function by using the following command line.
%windir%\system32\regsvr32.exe -n -i:”UpdateСheck” “C:\Users\
<Admin>\AppData\Local\x86\8c01.nls”
This scheduled task checks the malware version and downloads the latest version from the remote server
every 60 seconds.

Figure 10 –

Scheduled Task Entry for Persistence
Then, the malware connects to the below URL and receives this base64-encoded response:
“hxxp://telemetrysystemcollection[.]com/m8YYdu/mCQ2U9/home.aspx”
The malware decodes the base64 content, an XOR encrypted binary that will be decrypted using a
hardcoded key FuHZu4rQgn3eqLZ6FB48Deybj49xEUCtDTAmF.

4/9

The decrypted content is the actual Matanbuchus malware that will be mapped into the same process and
executed using the export function DllRegisterServer.
The below figure shows the URL, XOR key, and export function names during runtime.

Figure 11 – URL and

XOR key to download Actual Matanbuchus DLL
The below figure shows the hardcoded strings related to Matanbuchus present in the memory of
regsvr32.exe. This indicates that the actual payload is loaded and executed in the memory without ever
dropping it on the disk.

Figure 12 –
Hardcoded Matanbuchus Strings
The Matanbuchus payload is responsible for executing other exe payloads as well as loading and
executing shellcodes and malicious DLL files.

Network Activities
The Matanbuchus payload connects to C&C server
hxxp://collectiontelemetrysystem[.]com/cAUtfkUDaptk/ZRSeiy/requets/index.php and sends the
base64-encoded POST request.
The decoded base64 content is in JSON, as shown in Figure 13.
The JSON values are encrypted using the RC4 key and encoded using base64. These will further be
decrypted on the server-side. This gives the TA victim details such as MAC address, computer name, etc.

5/9

Finally, Matanbuchus malware downloads two Cobalt Strike Beacons from the C&C servers.
First Cobalt-Strike Beacon:
The malware first downloads a file “cob23_443.txt” from hxxp://144.208.127[.]245/cob23_443.txt. This is
a hexadecimal binary file that will further be converted to ASCII characters and then downloads Cobalt
Strike Beacons from hxxps://extic[.]icu/empower/type.tiff.
The below figure shows the network communication which downloads the first Cobalt Strike Beacon.

details of First Cobalt-Strike Payload
Second Cobalt-Strike Beacon:
After downloading the first beacon, Matanbuchus downloads a second Cobalt Strike DLL file named
“cob_220_443.dll” from another URL:
hxxp://144.208.127[.]245/cob_220_443.dll
The below figure shows the network communication that downloads the second Cobalt Strike Beacon.

Conclusion
Threat Actors use various techniques to deploy their malicious payloads into the victim’s system. In this
case, we observed the TAs used Matanbuchus malware loader to deliver Cobalt Strike Beacons.
Cyble Research Labs will closely monitor the Matanbuchus malware group and other TAs and analyze
them to better understand their motivations and TTPs.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Avoid downloading files from unknown websites.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
7/9

Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solution on the employees’ systems.
