A new information-stealing malware named BlackGuard is winning the attention of the
cybercrime community, now sold on numerous darknet markets and forums for a lifetime price
of $700 or a subscription of $200 per month.
The stealer can snatch sensitive information from a broad range of applications, pack everything
in a ZIP archive and send it to the C2 of the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation.
Threat actors who purchased the subscription can then access the BlackGuard web panel to
retrieve the stolen data logs, either exploiting them themselves or selling them to others.

BlackGuard was spotted and analyzed by researchers at Zscaler, who have noticed a sudden
spike in the popularity of the malware, especially after the abrupt shutdown of Raccoon Stealer.
Bleeping Computer was able to find that BlackGuard first appeared on Russian-speaking
forums in January 2022, circulated privately for testing purposes.

Extensive stealing abilities
As with all modern information-stealers, there aren’t many apps storing or handling sensitive
user data that are not in BlackGuard’s targeting scope, and the focus is heavy on
cryptocurrency assets.
BlackGuard will seek the presence of the following software and attempt to steal user data from
them:
Web browsers: Passwords, cookies, autofill, and history from Chrome, Opera, Firefox,
MapleStudio, Iridium, 7Star, CentBrowser, Chedot, Vivaldi, Kometa, Elements Browser,
Epic Privacy Browser, uCozMedia, Coowon, liebao, QIP Surf, Orbitum, Comodo, Amigo,
Torch, Comodo, 360Browser, Maxthon3, K-Melon, Sputnik, Nichrome, CocCoc, Uran,
Chromodo, Edge, BraveSoftware

Wallet browser extensions: Binance, coin98, Phantom, Mobox, XinPay, Math10,
Metamask, BitApp, Guildwallet, iconx, Sollet, Slope Wallet, Starcoin, Swash, Finnie,
KEPLR, Crocobit, OXYGEN, Nifty, Liquality, Auvitas wallet, Math wallet, MTV wallet, Rabet
wallet, Ronin wallet, Yoroi wallet, ZilPay wallet, Exodus, Terra Station, Jaxx
Cryptocurrency wallets: AtomicWallet, BitcoinCore, DashCore, Electrum, Ethereum,
Exodus, LitecoinCore, Monero, Jaxx, Zcash, Solar, Zap, AtomicDEX, Binance, Frame,
TokenPocket, Wassabi
Email: Outlook
Messengers: Telegram, Signal, Tox, Element, Pidgin, Discord
Other: NordVPN, OpenVPN, ProtonVpn, Totalcommander, Filezilla, WinSCP, Steam
The collected information is bundled in a ZIP file, also known as logs, and sent to the C2 server
via a POST request, along with a system profiling report that sets a unique hardware ID for the
victim and determines their location.

Anti-detection features
BlackGuard’s evasion capabilities are still under heavy development, but some systems are
already in place to help the malware escape detection and analysis.
4/9

First, it is packed with a crypter, and all its strings are base64 obfuscated, so many anti-virus
tools relying on static detection will miss it.
Any AVs running on the system will be detected by the malware, which will then attempt to kill
their processes and terminate their operation.
The malware also checks the victim's IP address, and if it’s running on a system in Russia or
any other CIS country, it will stop and exit. This is yet another indication of the origin of the
malware.

Finally, an anti-debug feature blocks the operation of the mouse and keyboard inputs, making it
further difficult for researchers to analyze the malware.

Outlook
Info-stealers are on the rise, with Redline, MarsStealer, Vidar Stealer, and AZORult currently
dominating the space.
The exit of Raccoon Stealer, which was one of the biggest players, has left a gap in the
cybercrime market, so other MaaS operators will try to take advantage of this development.
Daria Romana Pop, a threat analyst at KELA, has shared the following insights with Bleeping
Computer on the status of the info-stealers landscape:

5/9

"Given the increase in usage and exploitation of compromised accounts and data obtained by
information stealers as a vector for initial access to a target, KELA has recently observed new
variants being advertised on cybercrime forums, as threat actors aim at improving the malware
capabilities to better avoid detection and to advance the data collection and exfiltration
processes."
"BlackGuard stealer launched in early 2021. As cybercriminals are constantly testing the
capabilities of such malicious tools, they do not shy away from demanding more quality and
improvements. KELA came across several recent discussions in which users were complaining
about BlackGuard not being able to properly avoid detection. As in any business, the operators
promised to provide an updated version in no time."

Author of BlackGuard promising to improve anti-detection scheme (KELA)
"In a different scenario, KELA identified META - a new information stealer very similar in
appearance to RedLine, whose collected data is being sold on the TwoEasy botnet
marketplace. The stealer was launched at the beginning of March, now sold for USD125 per
month or USD1000 for unlimited use, and the operators claim that it is an improved version of
RedLine."

To protect yourself from all of the circulating info-stealing malware, avoid visiting shady websites
and downloading files from untrustworthy or dubious sources.

6/9

Finally, use two-factor authentication, keep your OS and applications up to date, and use strong
and unique passwords for all your online accounts.

Another fine article Bill ~!
Unless Blackguard somehow ships with own ZIP capability, guess it uses Windows itself
to package those .ZIP files before being sent ? Other concerns too, vulnerability like
sending LNK malware via ZIP had been an issue. Luckily we can disable reading that
extension entirely with Windows, with no default program set. Also, can lower CPU usage
when disabled on some PC, otherwise always indexing ZIPs in background.

LOL, that wont do anything mate.
Ever heard of compress-archive in Powershell?
By the way most stealers like this will set the registry values before execution anyway to
ensure it works, that is IF the user has elevated privs.
