I got a tip a very short time ago in our slack group about possible Carbanak source code
leak.
A quick google search proven this is indeed a possibility.
hxxp://mal4all.com/showthread.php?tid=494&action=lastpost
Here is the source code in a zip file.
Please make sure you use proper security steps such as sandbox and isolated environment.
The origin of this zip files is unknown and was not inspected for booby traps etc.
This file was uploaded for research and defense purpose only. If you plan to use this for
malicious reasons you suck.
Pass: f1Up$zD%QY*p5@!&
If you are creating any signatures such as Yara and Snort please share back with the
community.
Happy Researching
My team at Minerva have organized the information into a single blog post:
Initial analysis and insights about the enhanced #Buhtrap source code #leak (not
#carbanak) https://t.co/b4hCMmc5fp

Some on-going updates posted during the initial investigation:
I wouldn't put a solid carbanak tag on it just yet :) it sure has similarities...

after deeper look into Ratopak we should say - it is not original Buhtrap but Pegasus.
Pegasus and Buhtrap have very similar TTP. So, Ratopak is the right shot here.

Comodo signed binaries from this #carbanak leak (CN="\"Allegro\" LLC", O="\"Allegro\"
LLC", STREET="Nagatinsky 2ND, 2,2", L=Moscow, ST=Moscow,
OID.2.5.4.17=115487, C=RU) leads to this attack on Russian
banks:https://t.co/LTbCr8CVu6https://t.co/gmcw2xk76H

At least some parts of the source code leak fit to Buhtrap/Ratopak
(f4ae5579930f20ccc41d1f8b1e417e87) code as described here:

Ok just clarifying this is leak is not #Carbanak leak as the source zip states. Its leak
from #RatoPak group.

Probably why this group was called Pegasus before the leak:

This potential #Carbanak code is very well documented. Example from the lateral
movement section. pic.twitter.com/DD8e5cFI5V

Funny, comment: decryption of svchost will trigger @kaspersky KIS emulator.

Also the #carbanak leak seems to have a step by step guide to use/hack swift.
Can anyone experience with #swift confirm this? pic.twitter.com/9N3zgJvNCM

Somebody leaked the Carbanak source code last week
I've been talking with several security researchers who are currently trying to verify the
code's authenticity and they believe it to be the real thing, albeit they're not 100% sure

Are you wondering why the leaked #carbanak zip files are named after @groupib ?
Well they are the firs to discover #carbanak which was named Anunak by them. Also
been actively working against the hacker group for many years.

Some of the leaked files are corresponding to banks hacked by #Corkow group. Really
interesting: https://t.co/OHeGTg7f2E

This #RatoPak / (not) #Carbanak leak investigation and discussions really shows once
again how difficult attribution can be and why security researchers should collaborate
as much as possible. Long night a head of us (:

Nice admin panel you've got there :) its #notcarbanak but #ratopak according to

Confirmed Link: '#Pegasus' shares some code lib struct with #Buhtrap and appears to
be an improved/altered version of the leaked Buhtrap main 'lib' (machineid, mem, etc.)
h/t @push_pnx for lead
