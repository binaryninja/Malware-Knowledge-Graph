Executive Summary
As of Mar 22, 2023 SentinelOne began to see a spike in behavioral detections of the
3CXDesktopApp, a popular voice and video conferencing software product categorized
as a Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) platform.
Behavioral detections prevented these trojanized installers from running and led to
immediate default quarantine.
The trojanized 3CXDesktopApp is the first stage in a multi-stage attack chain that pulls
ICO files appended with base64 data from Github and ultimately leads to a 3rd stage
infostealer DLL still being analyzed as of the time of writing.
The compromise includes a code signing certificate used to sign the trojanized
binaries.
Our investigation into the threat actor behind this supply chain is ongoing. The threat
actor has registered a sprawling set of infrastructure starting as early as February
2022, but we don’t yet see obvious connections to existing threat clusters.
March 30th, 2023: We have updated our IOCs with contributions from the research
community.
March 30th, 2023: We can confirm that the MacOS installer is trojanized, as reported
by Patrick Wardle. We have identified the limited deployment of a second-stage
payload for Mac infections. We have updated our IOCs to reflect MacOS components.
Our telemetry now sets the earliest infection attempt as March 8th, 2023.

Background
3CXDesktopApp is a voice and video conferencing Private Automatic Branch Exchange
(PABX) enterprise call routing software developed by 3CX, a business communications
software company. The company website claims that 3CX has 600,000 customer companies
with 12 million daily users. 3CX lists customer organizations in the following sectors:
Automotive
Food & Beverage
Hospitality
Managed Information Technology Service Provider (MSP)
Manufacturing
The 3CX PBX client is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux; there are also mobile
versions for Android and iOS, as well as a Chrome extension and a Progressive Web App
(PWA) browser-based version of the client.
PBX software makes an attractive supply chain target for actors; in addition to monitoring an
organization’s communications, actors can modify call routing or broker connections into
voice services from the outside. There have been other instances where actors use PBX and
VOIP software to deploy additional payloads, including a 2020 campaign against Digium
VOIP phones using a vulnerable PBX library, FreePBX.

Campaign Overview
As others have noted, SentinelOne began automatically detecting and blocking the activity
over the span of the week, prior to our active investigation of the campaign.

Seems like this has progressed into “3cx desktop app is compromised and the
prevailing theory is that its the wannacry people who are behind it”? So that’s
something to keep an eye on I guess… pic.twitter.com/vkVnXtRDd5

As we actively analyze the malicious installer, we see an interesting multi-stage attack chain
unfolding. The 3CXDesktopApp application serves as a shellcode loader with shellcode
executed from heap space. The shellcode reflectively loads a DLL, removing the “MZ” at the
start. That DLL is in turn called via a named export ‘DllGetClassObject’ with the following
arguments:
1200 2400 "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) 3CXDesktopApp/18.11.1197
Chrome/102.0.5005.167 Electron/19.1.9 Safari/537.36”

as well as the size of this User-Agent string.
This stage will in turn download icon files from a dedicated Github repository:
https://github[.]com/IconStorages/images

These ICO files have Base64 data appended at the end. That data is then decoded and
used to download another stage. At this time, the DLL appears to be a previously unknown
infostealer meant to interface with browser data, likely in an attempt to enable future
operations as the attackers sift through the mass of infected downstream customers. We
have issued a takedown request for this repository.
The final stage (cad1120d91b812acafef7175f949dd1b09c6c21a) implements infostealer
functionality, including gathering system information and browser information from Chrome,
Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers. That includes querying browsing history and data from
the Places table for Firefox-based browsers and the History table for Chrome-based
browsers.

For SentinelOne customers, no action is needed. We’ve provided technical indicators to
benefit all potential victims in hunting for the SmoothOperator campaign.

Indicators of Compromise
Note: we have removed soyoungjun[.]com and convieneonline[.]com as they were linked
based on inaccurate information from a passive DNS provider. Thank you to Daniel Gordon
for the tip.
We have also added the full list of URIs decrypted from the ICO files previously referenced.
Thanks to Johann Aydinbas for the excellent work!
