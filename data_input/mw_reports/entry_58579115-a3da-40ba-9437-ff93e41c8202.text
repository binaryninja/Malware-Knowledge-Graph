Threat Analysis Group

1/7

Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) continues to closely monitor the cybersecurity
environment in Eastern Europe with regard to the war in Ukraine. Many Russian government
cyber assets have remained focused on Ukraine and related issues since the invasion
began, while Russian APT activity outside of Ukraine largely remains the same. TAG
continues to disrupt campaigns from multiple sets of Russian government-backed attackers,
some of which are detailed in our previous updates.
Similarly, Russian observed disinformation efforts are also focused on the war in Ukraine and
TAG has disrupted coordinated influence operations from several actors including the
Internet Research Agency and a Russian consulting firm as detailed in the TAG Bulletin.
Most of these coordinated influence operations are Russian language efforts aimed at
ensuring domestic support in Russia for the war.
Here is a deeper look at some campaign activity TAG has observed since our last update:
Turla, a group publicly attributed to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), recently hosted
Android apps on a domain spoofing the Ukrainian Azov Regiment. This is the first known
instance of Turla distributing Android-related malware. The apps were not distributed through
the Google Play Store, but hosted on a domain controlled by the actor and disseminated via
links on third party messaging services. We believe there was no major impact on Android
users and that the number of installs was miniscule.
The app is distributed under the guise of performing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against
a set of Russian websites. However, the 'DoS' consists only of a single GET request to the
target website, not enough to be effective. The list of target websites for the app can be seen
in the CyberChef recipe here.

Turla website disseminating fake DoS Android Apps.
During our investigation into the Turla CyberAzov apps, we identified another Android app
first seen in the wild in March 2022 that also claimed to conduct DoS attacks against Russian
websites. In this case, the Android app name was stopwar.apk (com.ddos.stopwar) and was
distributed from the website stopwar.pro. This app is quite different from the Turla apps
described above and written by a different developer. It also downloads a list of targets from
an external site, but unlike the Turla apps, it continually sends requests to the target websites
until it is stopped by the user.

Pro-Ukrainian website used for disseminating StopWar.apk.
Based on our analysis, we believe that the StopWar app was developed by pro-Ukrainian
developers and was the inspiration for what Turla actors based their fake CyberAzov DoS
app off of.

The Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190), first disclosed in late May, received significant
usage from both APT and cybercrime groups throughout June after it was patched by
Microsoft. Follina is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows
Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT).
Consistent with CERT-UA reporting, TAG observed multiple Russian GRU actors - APT28
and Sandworm - conduct campaigns exploiting the Follina vulnerability. The Sandworm
campaign used compromised government accounts to send links to Microsoft Office

documents hosted on compromised domains, primarily targeting media organizations in
Ukraine.
TAG has also observed an increasing number of financially motivated actors targeting
Ukraine. One recent campaign from a group tracked by CERT-UA as UAC-0098 delivered
malicious documents with the Follina exploit in password-protected archives, impersonating
the State Tax Service of Ukraine. We assess this actor is a former initial ransomware access
broker who previously worked with the Conti ransomware group distributing the IcedID
banking trojan based on overlaps in infrastructure, tools used in previous campaigns, and a
unique cryptor.
Ghostwriter/UNC1151, a threat actor attributed to Belarus, has remained active targeting
accounts of webmail and social media networks of Polish users. They continue to use the
'Browser in the Browser' phishing technique that TAG first observed and described in March.
An example of this technique, used to target Facebook users, can be seen in the screenshot
below.

COLDRIVER, a Russian-based threat actor sometimes referred to as Callisto, continues to
send credential phishing emails to targets including government and defense officials,
politicians, NGOs and think tanks, and journalists. In addition to including phishing links
directly in the email, the attackers also link to PDFs and/or DOCs, hosted on Google Drive
and Microsoft One Drive, that contain a link to an attacker-controlled phishing domain. In at
least one case, unrelated to Ukraine, they have leaked information from a compromised
account.
These phishing domains have been blocked through Google Safe Browsing – a service that
identifies unsafe websites across the web and notifies users and website owners of potential
harm.

In another campaign tracked by CERT-UA as UAC-0056 we observed compromised email
addresses of a Regional Prosecutor’s office of Ukraine leveraged to send malicious Microsoft
Excel documents with VBA macros delivering Cobalt Strike. In just two days, the volume
observed and categorized as spam by Gmail exceeded 4,500 emails. Email contents vary
from COVID-19 vaccine policy to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.
