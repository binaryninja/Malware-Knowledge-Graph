Introduction
As I mentioned last week, Rig exploit kit (EK) is one of a handful of EKs still active in the
wild. Today's diary examines another recent example of an infection caused by Rig EK on
Monday 2019-06-24.

Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.

1/9

Shown above: Some of the alerts generated by this infection using Security Onion with
Suricata and the EmergingThreats Pro ruleset viewed in Sguil.
Malvertising campaign redirect domain
EK-based malvertising campaigns have "gate" domains that redirect to an EK. In this case,
the gate domain was makemoneyeasywith[.]me. According to Domaintools, this domain was
registered on 2019-06-19, and indicators of this domain redirecting to Rig EK were reported
as early as 2019-06-21.

Shown above: makemoneyeasywith[.]me redirecting to Rig EK landing page on 2019-06-24.
Rig EK
The Rig EK activity I saw on 2019-06-24 was similar to Rig EK traffic I documented in an ISC
diary last week. See the images below for details.

Shown above: Rig EK sends a malware payload.
The malware payload
The malware payload sent by this example of Rig EK appears to be Pitou.B. In my postinfection activity, I saw several attempts at malspam, but I didn't find DNS queries for any of
the mail servers associated with this spam traffic.
Prior to the spam activity, I saw traffic over TCP port 2287 which matched a signature for
ETPRO TROJAN Win32/Pitou.B, and it also fit the description for Pitou.B provided by
Symantec from 2016. I didn't let my infected Windows host run long enough to generate
DNS queries for remote locations described in Symantec's Technical Description for this
Trojan. However, Any.Run's sandbox analysis of this malware shows DNS queries similar to
the Symantec description that happened approximately 9 to 10 minutes after the initial
infection activity.

spam.
