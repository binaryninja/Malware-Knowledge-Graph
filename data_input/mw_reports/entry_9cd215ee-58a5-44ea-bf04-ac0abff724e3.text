The same hackers who infiltrated the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) website after its
damning report on the Russian government's major cover-up of doping during the 2014
Sochi Games is likely the team behind the breach of the Democratic National Committee in
July, cybersecurity experts said. WADA's nearly 100-page report resulted in a ban on
Russian athletes from this summer's Rio Olympics.
Researchers at Arlington-based cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect believe that the
cybercriminals behind the breach were part of the decade-old Russian hacking group "Fancy
Bear." Last week, WADA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said they were targeted
by hackers with so-called phishing emails sent to users of the database claiming to be official
WADA communications requesting their login credentials.

After reviewing the two domains provided in the WADA alert, the researchers found that "the
sites were recently registered and their registration and hosting information are consistent
with Russian Fancy Bear tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)". They also identified
another domain registered by the same threat actors that spoofs the official CAS domain.
ThreatConnect director of research operations Toni Gidwani told The Guardian that the
cybersecurity team believes the attack was also a form of retaliation against Yuliya
Stepanova, the Russian runner and doping whistleblower who helped uncover the statesponsored doping scandal. The middle-distance runner, whose WADA and email accounts
were hacked on 13 August, was called "Judas" by Vladimir Putin. Stepanova was then
forced to go into hiding in the United States with her husband Vitaly, a former Russian antidoping official.
"They attacked her email, they got her records out of WADA," Gidwani said. "There's very
much a retaliatory aspect to it and a way of intimidating anybody who might be thinking about
speaking out."
The firm also noted that both the phishing and Stepanova's compromise are likely a part of
"targeted activity by Russian actors in response to the whistleblower and the WADA's
recommendation to ban all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games" in
Rio.
"Successful operations against these individuals and organisations could facilitate Russian
efforts to privately or publically intimidate them or other potential whistleblowers,"
ThreatConnect researchers wrote in a blog post. "At this time, we are skeptical of
@anpoland's origins but cannot determine the extent to which, if any, they are a Russian
platform similar to Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks."
ThreatConnect added that the recent hack highlights the strong, long-running connection
between sports and Russian political figures, saying they expect to see more Russian
cyberattacks targeting Professor Richard McLaren and Dr Grigory Rodchenkov who were
key sources in the doping scandal investigation.
"Russian activity targeting these organisations is an important example of how Russia
responds to wide-reaching current events that have negative implications for Moscow," the
firm noted. "Organisations involved in such events can reasonably expect to experience
targeted Russian cyber operations that ultimately facilitate retaliatory influence or
propaganda efforts against them. Knowledge of this TTP, and others associated with Russian
APT activity, can help those organisations augment their security posture and defend against
such retaliation."
Multiple cybersecurity firms including CrowdStrike and ThreatConnect have provided
evidence linking the Russian government to the DNC infiltration reportedly carried out by
hacker groups Cosy Bear and Fancy Bear. Following a brief Twitter suspension, 'lone wolf'

The Kremlin, on the other hand, has vehemently denied playing any role in the hacks.
