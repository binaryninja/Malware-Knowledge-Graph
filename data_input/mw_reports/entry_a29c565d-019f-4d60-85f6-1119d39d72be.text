Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered in OPC UA Industrial Protocol
Source: https://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com

OPC UA is an industrial protocol for reliable and secure data
transmission between various systems on an industrial network.
This protocol is widely used by major vendors in modern
industrial facilities, in the manufacturing, oil and gas,
pharmaceuticals industries and others. Kaspersky Lab experts
analysed OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and discovered
that implementations of the protocol contained code design
and writing errors. Overall, 17 zero-day vulnerabilities were
identified and reported to the developers. These vulnerabilities
could result in heavy damage to industry. There was risk of
Denial-of-Service to industrial systems by disrupting or shutting
down industrial processes. The remote code execution
vulnerability allows attackers to send any kind of server
commands to control industrial processes, or continue their
intrusion into the network.

Australia’s Parliament passed the Security of Critical
Infrastructure Bill in March 2018 to protect the electricity, gas,
ports, and water sectors from ‘foreign involvement’ that could
lead to espionage, sabotage, and coercion. It also gives
Ministers the power to direct companies to conduct risk
mitigation actions. Under s32(2), the Australian Security
Intelligence Organisation can provide advice to the Minister in
the form of a security assessment, with the Minister then able to
‘direct critical infrastructure owners or operators to do or not do
a certain thing to mitigate a risk that has been identified as
prejudicial to security’. The government also launched Critical
Infrastructure Centre last year that works across electricity,
water, ports, and telecommunications to conduct national
security risk assessments and make suggestions for mitigation
strategies.

agency wide cybersecurity strategy by September 2016, but
investigators said that no such plan has been drafted. NASA’s
CIO told GAO that the agency will soon begin rolling out a
strategy based on the National Institute of Standards and
Technology’s cybersecurity framework. The NASA Inspector
General also highlighted numerous shortcomings in the Security

Canadian Banks Warn: Hackers Might have Stolen Data
Source: http://www.cbc.ca/

On May 28, two major Canadian banks: Bank of Montreal and
online bank Simplii Financial — owned by Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (CIBC) warned that hackers might have
accessed the personal and financial information of nearly
90,000 customers. Hackers threatened to make this information
public unless the lenders pay a $1-million ransom in
cryptocurrency ‘Ripple’. In an email the hackers said that they
accessed information such as names, account numbers,
passwords, security questions and answers, and even social
insurance numbers and account balances, by exploiting
weaknesses in the two banks' security systems. They used
algorithm to get account numbers, which allowed them to
pose as authentic account holders who had simply forgotten
their password which was apparently enough to allow them
to reset the backup security questions and answers, giving them
access to the account. Both banks are in contact of those who
have been affected and are providing instruction on how to
monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.

Use of Power Lines to Steal Data from Air-gapped Computers
Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04014.pdf

PowerHammer is a new type of attack that uses the power lines
to steal data from air-gapped computers. In this case, a
malicious code running on a compromised computer can
control power consumption of the system by intentionally
regulating the CPU utilization. Data is modulated, encoded,
and transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations, and
then it is conducted and propagated through the power lines.
This phenomenon is known as a ’conducted emission’. There
are two versions of this attack. First, Line level power-hammering
attack, in which the attacker taps the in-home powerlines that
are directly attached to the electrical outlet. Second, Phase
level power-hammering attack, in which the attacker taps the
power lines at the phase level, in the main electrical service
panel. In both versions of the attack, the attacker measures the
emission conducted and then decodes the data.

by 35 percent of engineering & ICS integration networks.
 For all other industries (manufacturing, transportation,
utilities, food, healthcare, etc.) the proportion of ICS
computers attacked ranged from 26 percent to 30 percent
on average.
 The vast majority of detected attacks were accidental hits.
 The sector that demonstrated the most noticeable growth
of ICS computers attacked was construction, with 31
percent attacked.
 Researchers have discovered a rise in mining attacks on
ICS.
 The top five countries by percentage of ICS computers
attacked includes Vietnam (70%), Algeria (66%), Morocco
(60%), Indonesia (60%) and China (60%).
 In 2017, 11% of all ICS systems were attacked by botnet

Five Most Dangerous New Attack Techniques
Source: https://www.sans.org/

SANS Institute researchers at RSA Conference 2018 shared what
they believe to be the five most dangerous new attack
techniques in cybersecurity:

Ed Skoudis, James Lyne and Johannes
Ullrich

Repositories and Cloud Storage Data Leakage: With vast online
code repositories for collaboration and cloud data storage
hosting mission-critical applications, attackers are increasingly
targeting such infrastructures, looking for passwords, crypto
keys, access tokens, and terabytes of sensitive data.
Big Data Analytics, De-Anonymization, and Correlation: Now
the battle is shifting from hacking machines to hacking data gathering data from disparate sources and fusing it together to
de-anonymize
users,
find
business
weaknesses
and
opportunities.

PAGE 8

Exploitability in ICS/SCADA: Publicly visible ICS attacks like
Triton/TriSYS show capability and intent to compromise some of
the highest risk components of industrial environments. Many
systems in this domain lack the mitigations of modern operating
systems and applications. Attackers have demonstrated they
have the inclination and resource to diversify their attacks
which opens up new and concerning possibilities.
Attackers Monetize Compromised Systems Using Crypto-Miners:
Most commonly stolen data like credit card numbers has
dropped significantly in value. Attackers will instead install
crypto coin miners. These attacks are stealthier and less likely to
be discovered.
Hardware Flaws: Hardware is no less complex then software
and mistakes have been made just as they are made in
software. Patching hardware is a lot more difficult and often
not possible without replacing entire systems or suffering
significant performance penalties.

IBM banned its staff from using removable storage devices
(e.g.: USB, SD card, flash drive). The move is to minimise the
possible financial and reputational damage from misplaced,
lost or misused removable portable storage devices. IBM
employees are advised to use company’s sync ‘n’ share
service to move data around. Parts of IBM have already been

The IETF finalized Transportation Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 version
after 28 drafts. TLS 1.3 protocol provides unparalleled privacy
and performance compared to previous versions of TLS. With
TLS 1.3, HTTPS performance has been made faster and safer for
every user and every device. TLS 1.3 stopped supporting many
of the older encryption algorithms that TLS 1.2 supports that over
the years people have managed to find holes in. The new
protocol aims to comprehensively thwart any attempts by the
eavesdroppers to decrypt intercepted HTTPS connections. The
new security protocol reduces latency caused during the TLS
Handshake by removing a whole round-trip connection for
session establishment.

Multi-Stage Intrusion Campaign Against CII by Nation States
Sh. Mohammed Zaki Ahmed, Sectoral Coordinator, Power, NCIIPC

Recently US-CERT issued an alert on a nation state cyber
activity targeting Energy, Nuclear, Commercial Facilities, Water,
Aviation, and Critical Manufacturing Sectors of United States [1].
This alert refers Symantec Dragonfly reports published on 06
September 2017 [2]. Symantec has been chasing Dragonfly
group since 2011, however their report of September 2017
speaks about ‘Dragonfly 2.0’, which is based on their
assessment of group’s activities since 2015. Confirmed targets of
the Dragonfly campaign include US, Canada and Turkey.
Dragonfly campaign is a multi-stage intrusion attack, which first
targets intermediate subjects and finally compromises the
Industrial Control Systems of OT.

Confirmed targets of
the Dragonfly
campaign include US,
Canada and Turkey.
Dragonfly campaign is
a multi-stage intrusion
attack, which first
targets intermediate
subjects and finally
compromises the
Industrial Control
Systems of OT.

Motive behind the attack may be intelligence gathering,
sabotage or holding backdoors for future exploitation. The
attack methodology involves usage of Spear Phishing Emails,
Trojan Software, and Watering Hole Websites for compromising
intermediate targets. Intermediate targets may be subjects
dealing with Business or IT or Safety Networks. Once the
attacker has access to the Business/IT Network, it sets its
Command and Control Centre (CNC-1) and tries to exploit ICS
systems of the OT through various vulnerabilities such as SMB,
NetBIOS; and sets up a web shell (Web/Email) server as
Command and Control Centre (CNC-2), where it uploads
different modules for further exploitation and communication. A
secure VPN access is created for communication between
victims and the CNC-2. Attackers are able to collect snapshots
of the HMI Workstations of OT.
Mitigation Strategy: Organisations may thwart such attacks by
following Cyber Security best practices with due diligence:
 Implement Patch Management practices for
components. Update firmware as and when available.

ICS

 Segregate ICS network from Enterprise or Business Network.
If feasible keep the ICS systems air-gapped.
 Use multi-factor authentication such as biometric access
control for allowing access to ICS/OT from other zones.
 Segregate Safety Systems such as SIS from ICS. Configure
different zones through a firewall.
 Explore possibility of deploying data diodes. This will enable
unidirectional data flow and may help in avoiding
Command-and-Control operations of malware.
 Generate awareness in employees for Phishing Attacks and
Cyber Security.

NCIIPC NEWSLETTER

 Establish Security Operation Centre and monitor ICS traffic
for security anomalies. ICS devices have a static pattern of
communication
over
DNP/MODBUS/ICCP/IEC.
Any
abnormal pattern such as a device trying to connect with
unknown IP Addresses should be monitored and incident
alert should be issued on priority.

Router-based Attacks: Next Big Trend in Cybersecurity
Sh. Niraj Vishnoi, Threat Researcher, NCIIPC

Source: https://cyf4.com

Many of the infected
devices have known
public exploits and use
default credentials,
meaning that
customers who set up
their home router out
of the box and never
changed the
password or updated
the firmware could be
at a higher risk.

In last three months there have been series of reports pointing
to attacks on Routers. On 25th May Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) issued an urgent bulletin [1] for anyone with a
home or small office router to immediately turn it off and then
turn it on again as a way to temporarily thwart the spread of
foreign malware. The malware, called VPNFilter [2] targets small
home and office routers. Once a router is infected, the hackers
would potentially be able to use the device as a jumping-off
point to launch further attacks. Talos, the security arm of Cisco
reported that at least 500,000 devices in at least 54 countries
have been infected. Devices manufactured by Linksys, MikroTik,
Netgear and TP-Link were among those found to have been
affected, according to the Talos report. Many of the infected
devices have known public exploits and use default
credentials, meaning that customers who set up their home
router out of the box and never changed the password or
updated the firmware could be at a higher risk [3].
In the month of April, United States and United Kingdom issued
a joint statement that state-sponsored hackers are leveraging
vulnerabilities in routers and other network infrastructure devices
to
target
governments,
private-sector
organizations,
infrastructure providers, and ISPs.
Kaspersky Lab reported that a targeted phishing campaign
called Roaming Mantis, found primarily in South Korea,
changed DNS settings on routers, pointing users to malicious
websites that, in turn, prompted users to ‘update’ apps on
Android phones to deliver a payload that harvested
credentials, including those for two-factor authentication [4].
Akamai published a report detailing coordinated abuse of
flawed implementations of UPnP on routers allowing hackers to
inject NAT rules, creating a proxy for hackers to disguise the
origin of their traffic. Akamai's report indicated 65,000 routers
compromised in this way, with over 4.8 million routers potentially
vulnerable [5].

PAGE 12

NCIIPC NEWSLETTER

In March, a report from Kaspersky Lab detailed the Slingshot
malware, which targeted individuals, government agencies,
and organizations located primarily in Kenya, Yemen, Libya,
and Afghanistan. Mikrotik routers were leveraged in the
Slingshot malware attack [6-7].
Most of these routers are at ‘always-on’ condition and rarely
updated. Since routers play important role in normal network
operations, so utilization of these devices in man-in-the-middle
attacks is extremely attractive for attackers. Considering the
multitude of Router models and the difficulty of supporting and
updating so many devices, make these devices low hanging
fruit for hackers. A compromised router can also serve as a
platform for attacking other devices on your local network,
such as your phone or laptop, or for launching denial-of-service
attacks against Internet websites. Router exposed to the
outside world, is frequently targeted by automated scans,
probes and exploits. Compared to other IT devices, router
doesn't have an antivirus program or other security software to
protect it.

Threat Assessment for Telecom Sector
Sh. Neeraj Saini, Sectoral Coordinator, Telecom, NCIIPC

The Telecom sector has witnessed exponential growth
especially in emerging economies like India. This has resulted in
rapid expansion of the network, addition of value-added
services and resultant increase in complexity of the entire setup.
Often, security can get overlooked or kept on the backburner
in the rush to increase market share and reduce costs.

Considering the
multitude of models
router vendors
produce and the
difficulty of supporting
and updating so many
devices makes these
devices low hanging
fruit for hackers.

NCIIPC NEWSLETTER

There are varieties of
security issues – some
of which are solvable,
while others will remain
known risks till costfeasible measures can
be found to address
them.

Major telecom
equipment providers
are not always the
most security
conscious
infrastructure providers
out there. Security

documentation is
usually sparse and
tightly held by the

PAGE 13

However, cyber-criminals don’t care for such economic
realities, and they have begun to increasingly target telecom
infrastructure, especially as it becomes IP-based. This combined
with increasing regulations towards telecom security have
created quite a challenge that companies are seeking to
address. There are varieties of security issues – some of which
are solvable, while others will remain known risks till cost-feasible
measures can be found to address them.
Telecom Security Threats:
Major threats to Telecom Security usually fall into the following
categories:


Phone Fraud: Toll Fraud, Cramming, Telemarketing fraud,
War dialling and so on



Theft: Data theft, network abuse, illegal data interception,
unauthorized data modification (in billing or routing based
processes)



Malware: Viruses, Trojan horse



Spam: Sending spam messages via SMS, MMS



DDoS Attacks: Distributed Denial of Service attacks
constitute the great threat to the accessibility of the
telecom providers. These attacks occur frequently and may
target authorities, companies and citizens. DDoS attacks
are carried out online and, to a lesser extent, via mobile
networks, against telecom service providers, their
customers, and the telecommunications infrastructure.



Data Leakage: Penetrating billing and CRM systems to
extract customer data

Typical Security Challenges:
Telecom companies face the following security challenges:


Lack of Vendor’s Concern: Major telecom equipment
providers are not always the most security conscious
infrastructure providers out there. Security hardening
documentation is usually sparse and tightly held by the
vendors themselves.



Lack of Security Awareness: Many security teams in telecom
companies are not aware of various security parameters in
which equipments can be hardened. Equipemnts being
used with default configurations causes security challenges.



Absence of Proper Testing Setup: Few companies have
proper test setups where equipment can be scanned and
hardened to ensure that vulnerabilities are fixed, yet
productivity isn’t being hampered.





Lack of Monitoring: Effective monitoring systems that can
trace to individual operator along with details of the
timestamp, system from which the command was run, and
the actual user running the command must be
implemented.
Supply Chain Risks: In today’s global threat landscape,
government sponsored intrusions into the integrity of
telecom equipment has created concerns for India. In other
countries the regulators have stepped in to ensure that
equipment is tested in an accredited lab.

Threats for BFSI Sector
Sh. Aniruddha Kumar, Sectoral Coordinator, BFSI, NCIIPC

BFSI Sector remains one of the major targets of rouge actors.
Based on various sources/feeds, following are some of the
major attack vectors for BFSI sector:


Ransomware & Crypto Currencies: In a ransomware attack,
fraudsters demand ransom amount in cryptocurrencies like
BitCoin etc. In last couple of years, these attacks have
increased significantly, thus posing considerable risk to
National
Critical
Information
Infrastructure
(NCII).
Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) is also available online. So
far, the most sophisticated ransomware attack in BFSI sector
has been the Black Swan attack.



Social Engineering Attacks: Social Engineering attacks like
Phishing, Vishing, Card Skimming and Spoofing are still
popular in the BFSI sector.



Rogue Apps: Fraudsters are also targeting the legitimate
and proprietary mobile apps developed by the financial
service providers. After tweaking some of the functionalities
of the Apps, the culprits are hosting these rogue Apps on
third party websites other than the Google Play Store.



Deep Web and Dark Web: Information like Credit/Debit
cards, bank account credentials, data base leaks, internal
network schema, employee details, customers detail etc.
pertaining to BFSI sector is available for sale on Dark Web.

Clone Chip-and-PIN Cards

The cybercriminals’
app installed in card
chip can say a PIN is
valid; no matter what
PIN was entered.

Kaspersky researchers discovered a group of cyber crooks from
Brazil who has developed a way to steal card data and
successfully clone chip-and-PIN cards. Brazilian group called
Prilex uses malware to infect Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals and
collect card data. When a customer makes payment at a shop
whose POS terminal is infected, the card data is transferred
right away to the criminals. To steal money, they also needed to
be able to clone cards. The Prilex group developed a whole
infrastructure that lets create cloned cards. The card-cloners
created an application for cards to run. The application tells
the POS terminal not to perform data authentication. That
means no cryptographic operations, sparing them the nearimpossible task of obtaining the card’s private cryptographic
keys. But that still leaves PIN authentication. The app installed in
card chip can say a PIN is valid; no matter what PIN was
entered. That means that one can simply enter four random
digits — and they’ll always be accepted.

GravityRAT Malware Targeting Indian Entities

Cisco Talos reported a new piece of malware called
GravityRAT. This malware has been under development for last
two years, during which the developer has implemented new
features like file exfiltration, remote command execution
capability and anti-vm techniques. The majority of the
malicious documents crafted by the malware author are
Microsoft Office Word documents. The attacker uses an
embedded macro in order to execute malicious code on the
victim's system. The document asks the user to enable macros
in order to prove that the user is not a robot. By enabling
macros, the malware is able to begin its execution. The
malware author uses a versioning system starting by the G
letter. The oldest version we identified is G1.

All the malicious Office documents, and more specifically the
documents used to test antivirus on VirusTotal, were submitted
from Pakistan. It was found that across all of the C2 domains
listed, a large influx of traffic was originated from India. All of the
C2 domains were at least 50 percent requested by Indian IP
infrastructure. This actor is probably not the most advanced
actor as seen. But it managed to stay under the radar since
2016. They worked on malicious code, and produced four
variants. Each new variant included new features. The
developer used the same C2 infrastructure all this time. The
developer was clever enough to keep this infrastructure safe,
and not have it blacklisted by a security vendor. The actor took
their time to ensure they were not within a virtual environment
to avoid analysis. However, they did not take any time at all to
attempt to obfuscate their .NET code. The code was largely
trivial to reverse engineer, which meant static analysis was an
easy
option
for
this
piece

Malware Avoids Infecting Government and Military Networks
Source: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/

Security experts have discovered a new malware GoScanSSH
that targets vulnerable Linux-based systems and tries its best to
avoid infecting devices on government and military networks. It
scans the IP on port 22, looking for an open SSH port. If the IP
has an open SSH port, the malware runs to see if the IP hosts
any websites/domains of the following TLDs — .mil, .gov,. army,.
airforce, .navy, .gov.uk, .mil.uk, .govt.uk, .mod.uk, .gov.au,
.govt.nz, .mil.nz, .parliament.nz, .gov.il, .muni.il, .idf.il, .gov.za,
.mil.za, .gob.es, .police.uk. If not, the malware uses a list of over
7,000 user-password combos to guess the SSH credentials.
When the malware finds the remote device SSH credentials, it
reports back to its Command & Control server located on the
Dark Web (communications occur via Tor2Web proxies).

no intrusion protection system in place, and typically no
available host-based protection system such as an anti-virus
package are its target. Current estimate states that at least
500,000 devices in at least 54 countries are infected. The known
devices affected by VPNFilter are Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR

reflect a concerted
effort to target India,
North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)
and the United
Nations (UN) that have
a stake in the region.

APT36 (previously referred to as TEMP.Lapis and publicly referred
to as Operation Transparent Tribe, ProjectM, and Operation CMajor) is a long-standing espionage team that conducts
intelligence collection in support of a Nation State’s military and
diplomatic interests. APT36 intrusion campaigns which are
active since 2013 reflect a concerted effort to target India,
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United
Nations (UN) that have a stake in the region. Diplomatic and
military personnel of India have been the target of the majority
of APT36 campaigns. Open Sources indicate that Indian
embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan have also been
targeted. APT36 uses social engineering emails, often spoofed
to appear as if they originate from official personnel that
include malicious attachments or links. APT36 has also used
compromised websites as vectors for malware delivery.
Spoofed personas have included an employee of an Indian
news organization, Afghanistan's ambassador to the U.S., and
the Afghan Minister of Finance. Malicious attachments of APT36
have leveraged Office exploits CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2015-1641,
CVE-2015-1770, CVE-20103333, and CVE-2017-0199. Links direct
victims to malicious payloads hosted on fake or compromised
websites. APT36 employs open-source and custom malware
tools that range in functionality from keystroke logging to
targeting USB devices. SEEGAP malware propagates via USB,
which may facilitate targeting of air-gapped networks used for
sensitive military or diplomatic information. One of the APT36
malware has a feature that queries Google maps API through
the registered domain ‘shareboxs.net’ to display information
about victims' IP addresses, including satellite imagery of the

Port Automation and Cyber Risk
Sh. Abhijeet Raj Shrivastava, Sectoral Coordinator, Transport and Sh.
Vijay Kant Verma, Analyst, NCIIPC

Ship industry is reliant on a range of electronic devices and
software systems to operate efficiently in modern digital era,
which includes complex cargo management systems,
Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) and Electronic Chart Displays and Information
Systems (ECDIS). Automated terminals reduce unnecessary box
moves, shorten cycle times, and enables consistent and
predictable throughput numbers. Fully-automated terminals
have the advantage of low operating costs and reliable
operations. Automation does offer major port hubs better
predictability and consistency of container moves per hour.

PAGE 20

At the same time, automation reduces the environmental
impact since terminals are mostly electrified, giving ports an
additional competitive edge in an industry increasingly focused
on sustainability. However, full automation of port management
has increased vulnerability surface to cyber risks. This is due to
the use of technologically advanced and networked systems.
Cyber Risks:
 Lack or missing Cyber Crisis Management mechanism,
Business continuity plan / Disaster recovery plan in ports also
risk the national economy.
 The difficulty with protecting automated terminals from
cyber risks lies with their complexity. These terminals use
industrial control systems that translate sensorial data and
commands into mechanical actions. The network links
between mechanical equipment and sensors are exposed
to the same threats as data networks.

NCIIPC NEWSLETTER

Full automation of port
management has
increased vulnerability
surface to cyber risks.
This is due to the use of
technologically
advanced and
networked systems.

 Operational systems and data networks are not always
updated /patched or properly secured, allowing
unauthorized actor to gain comparatively easy access to
information.
 Industrial control systems are not designed with cyber risks or
active network monitoring in mind. This is especially true for
ships’ control systems, but can also affect the system
components of ports.
 Personal details of ship crews can still be easily accessed,
making them more vulnerable to social engineering via
phishing or other techniques, unknowingly granting access
to systems.
Prevention Mechanism against Cyber Risk in Ports:
 To prevent the ports and shipping industry from most
attacks, regular operating system updates, stronger
passwords, secure satellite connections, resilience exercises,
information sharing, and employee awareness campaigns
should be practiced.
 Major shipping hubs are part of large and less resilient
supply chains, which are essential for regional and
international trade. These supply chains depend on a small
number of key ports, which are vulnerable to shocks from
other ports. To make supply chains and port hubs more
resilient to cyber risks, the shipping industry as a whole will
have to adjust and prepare.
 Major port operators will have to work together and share
information on previous or ongoing attacks to NCIIPC and
other Government organization, so that experiences and
best practices can be shared directly. Agencies are able to
provide incident response in time.

These terminals use

Attack Exposure of Signalling System 7
Sh. Ashok Kumar Gupta, Analyst, Telecom, NCIIPC

Signalling System 7 (SS7) is an international telecommunication
standard that defines how network elements in a Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) exchange information over
a digital signalling network. Nodes in an SS7 network are called
signalling points. SS7 is also called Common Channel Signalling
7 (CCS7).

Attackers could exploit
security holes in SS7 to
track users'
movements,
communications and
eavesdrop on
conversations.

Attackers could exploit security holes in SS7 to track users'
movements, communications and eavesdrop on conversations
as demonstrated by security researchers in Germany. The
attack in question is essentially a man-in-the-middle attack on
cell phone communications that, among other things, exploits
the lack of authentication in the communication protocols that
run on top of SS7. The possibility of Denial-of-Service attack also
cannot be ruled out.
However, mobile community is working to address these threats
The GSMA, security vendors and mobile operators are
collaborating to better understand sophisticated adversaries'
means and ways of exploiting networks. Future networks require
the same degree of protection across all network types, be it
GSM, CDMA or LTE. With so many people dependent on mobile
devices to communicate and work, mobile network security is
more important than ever.

General Data Protection Regulation
Source: https://securitycommunity.tcs.com/

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is Europe's new
framework for data protection laws – it replaces the previous
1995 data protection directive. After more than four years of
discussion and negotiation, GDPR was adopted by both the
European Parliament and the European Council in April 2016. It
came into force from 25 May 2018. While it's a European data
privacy law, its impact will be felt all over the world.

PAGE 22

Anyone involved in processing personal data about individuals
in the EU (European Union) must comply, whether or not they're
located in the EU, the U.S., or anywhere else in the world. The
fines for companies that fail to comply can range from 2% to 4%
of global yearly revenue.
The GDPR includes 99 different provisions directing companies
on how to collect, manage, and process personal data while
outlining key data rights for EU residents.
Major changes GDPR will bring about are:
Data Protection Officer (DPO): Companies will be required to
appoint a Data Protection Officer who has independent
authority to oversee a company's compliance with GDPR.
Children Protection: GDPR provide protection for children by
requiring parental consent before a child's personal data can
be collected by a company.
Data Breach Reporting: The GDPR mandates reporting data
breaches to an EU regulator within 72 hours. That's just three
days of learning of an incident. This means companies need
clear escalation paths to their security and legal departments
when a breach occurs.
Privacy by design: Privacy by design means thinking about
data privacy and its implications when developing products,
features, and marketing campaigns based on personal data.

Recent Trend Towards in-Browser Mining of Cryptocurrencies
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02887

Research paper published in Cornell University Library examines
the recent trend towards in-browser mining of cryptocurrencies;
in particular, the mining of Monero through Coinhive and similar
code-bases. In this model, a user visiting a website will get a
JavaScript code downloaded to his/her machine that executes
at client-side in user’s browser, mines a cryptocurrency, typically
without user’s consent or knowledge, and pays out the
seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ
this as an alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue,
may offer premium content in exchange for mining, or may be
unwittingly serving the code as a result of a breach (in which
case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The
cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its
unfriendliness to large-scale ASIC mining that would drive
browser-based efforts out of the market, as well as for its
purported privacy features.

Cyber threats to the Transport Sector are of concern because
of the growing reliance on cyber-based control, navigation,

the ease with which malicious actors can exploit cyber systems
serving transportation [1]. For example, a cyber-attack on
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) could significantly impact
many transportation infrastructures.

A cyber-attack on
Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) could

Aviation: In the aviation industry, technical advances in
navigation systems and airframe design have reduced the
chances of an accident; however, the increasing reliance on
computers poses a different kind of threat. Traditionally air
gapped Air Traffic Control network considered to be the
backbone of aviation industry. But due to operational
efficiency and for faster communication these are now
interfacing with IT network and hence opened up a cyberattack vector that need to be guarded strongly.
Railway: As the rail industry adapts and becomes increasingly
dependent on electronic sensors and network technologies,
new vulnerabilities to physical networks may unfold [2]. Cyber
systems are used in rail transport and metro network for
communications-based automatic train control. These systems
control train movement, deliver power to the network, control
signalling infrastructure, report on the condition of the rolling
stock and associated infrastructure, support operational
planning and timetabling.
Shipping: Cyber-attack impacting marine transportation can
involve navigation, cargo control, and other industrial
processes, threatening lives, the environment, property, and
disrupting trade activity. Port operations such as raising a
drawbridge, controlling traffic lights, scheduling trucks, and
controlling pumps, values, and pipelines for delivery of fuel and
liquid cargo to ships can be impacted.

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, ARM
TrustZone, and SecureElements which process highly-sensitive
information. The second one is a graphical user interface (GUI)
which according to Microsoft is a ‘Secure Confirmation
Terminal’ operated by a trusted employee. The third and last
one is a cloud-based platform that could be used for
provisioning, key management, certificate authority, patch
management, and tamper-proof logging. Also, one of the most
important properties of TCPS is protection for data in
execution— by utilizing TEEs.

NCIIPC Initiatives
Integrity Checker
NCIIPC has developed a windows based utility named ‘Integrity
Checker’ to calculate and verify the hash of any file input. Hash
value, considered as the fingerprint of a file is processed
through cryptographic algorithm. If contents of file are altered
in any way, the hash value will be significantly different. This
utility supports MD5, SHA1, SHA128, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512
functions and can work across various windows platforms. It is
also easy to be operated by personnel with limited exposure to
technology.

NCIIPC at India-U.S. Cooperation on Global Security
National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) and the

and have been discussing issues of mutual security and safety
involving nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear safety, space
security issues, cyber security, missile proliferation and terrorism.
This year’s Dialogue under the title of Strategic Threats of the
21st Century was held on 2-4 May at Bangalore. NCIIPC actively
participated in the dialogue. There were more than 30 speakers
and participants from various organisations like NPCIL, DRDO,
