July 11, 2019 Proofpoint Threat Insight Team

Overview
Proofpoint researchers began tracking an actor (referred to as TA544) in February of 2017
when reports first emerged about malicious email campaigns targeting Italian customers
using the Panda Banker malware.
To date, this highly financially-motivated actor has delivered more than six unique malware
payloads (in several variations of each) in high-volume campaigns (hundreds of thousands of
messages per day) to victims across western Europe and Japan, where it now focuses on
the distribution of the Ursnif banking Trojan and URLZone banker.

Ursnif: The preferred malware payload of TA544
Ursnif is a common banking Trojan that can:
Steal stored data including passwords from banking websites via web injections,
proxies and VNC connections
Update itself or install modules remotely
Ursnif has many variants and names such as Dreambot, ISFB, Gozi, and Papras; it is
typically distributed in high volume campaigns (hundreds of thousands or millions of
messages).
Ursnif 1000
Ursnif 1000, the affiliate ID that is most closely associated with TA544, is typically distributed
in high-volume campaigns (hundreds of thousands of messages per day) that often target
the IT, technology, and marketing/ industries in Japan.
Most Ursnif 1000 campaigns use a robust combination of geofencing techniques to verify
that users are located in Japan. Messages from these campaigns drop their payloads via
Microsoft Excel documents with macros, that when enabled, download URLZone (another
banking Trojan), which, in turn, download Ursnif 1000.
Ursnif 4779

4/14

Ursnif 4779 is typically distributed in moderate volume campaigns (tens of thousands of
messages per day) that often target technology, manufacturing, and IT verticals in Italy. Like
Ursnif 1000, this variant is also associated with TA544.
Additionally, Ursnif 4779 shares much of its geofencing locale/language check techniques
with Ursnif 1000. Ursnif 4779 is deployed via one of two primary methods: (1) Microsoft
Excel attachments with malicious macros, that, when enabled, install Ursnif along with a
complex symmetric block cipher that is referred to as a “serpent key”, or (2) steganographic
images that conceal malicious PowerShell commands which install Ursnif.
Delivery
Ursnif delivery methods vary by circumstance, depending on the targeted vertical and
geography. Ursnif shares code with many other banking Trojans and the source code for an
earlier version was distributed on online forums for free. Often, malware authors modify or
adapt Ursnif code to serve particular purposes.
Ursnif can be deployed as a primary or secondary payload. It may be delivered via
password-protected Zip files; Microsoft Office document attachments with malicious macros;
or compressed JScript, JavaScripts, or Visual Basic scripts. However, the most common
vectors for TA544 campaigns are messages with Microsoft Office documents that contain
macros, that, when enabled, install URLZone and/or Ursnif.
Trends
As of 2019, Ursnif is one of the most prevalent banking Trojans in the threat landscape. In
Q4 2018, we observed Ursnif consistently reaching peak message volume.
Because of Ursnif’s variable nature, it is difficult to identify trends in delivery strategies.
Payload delivery is largely dependent on the threat actor, geography, and targeted verticals.
However, recent TA544 campaigns typically deploy Ursnif via Microsoft Office attachments
equipped with malicious macros that install the Ursnif banking trojan. Ursnif is sometimes
delivered as a standalone payload, but as in the case of TA544 with its campaigns in Japan,
it is more often deployed with other malware including URLZone.

Objectives
TA544 is a financially motivated actor that uses a variety of payloads to target both European
and Asian geographies. Proofpoint researchers have been able to identify commonalities
between the European and Asian campaigns, despite the differences in targeting and
geographic location.
One notable characteristic of TA544 is their use of steganography, which is the process of
concealing code within images. TA544 has implemented this strategy in recent Japanese
and Italian campaigns, embedding steganographic images of pop culture references into
5/14

attached Microsoft Office Documents. When the user enables the document macro, the
obfuscated code downloads and installs malware, usually URLZone and/or Ursnif as noted
above.

Targeting
TA544 has historically targeted Italy (ongoing), Japan (ongoing), Germany (defunct), Poland
(defunct), and Spain (defunct). In addition to malware specifically chosen for each country,
each region is targeted with appropriate language translations in email bodies, subjects,
filenames, and geographically relevant branding. Known targeted countries are listed in

Figure 2: TA544 campaign history
Proofpoint researchers began observing TA544 in Italy at the end of 2017, primarily
leveraging Panda Banker. In March of 2017, TA544 briefly experimented in Germany with
Ursnif variants but ceased activity in the region after only a short one-month period. Similarly,
TA544 also targeted Spanish audiences with ZLoader during the summer of 2018. During
these experimental phases, TA544 conducted ongoing campaigns that targeted Polish
audiences with Nymaim.
By September of 2018, TA544 began to focus its attacks on Japan, using standalone Ursnif
variants and/or URLZone which leads to Ursnif 1000 specifically. URLZone to Ursnif 1000
remains the primary strategy for TA544 campaigns that target Japanese audiences. During
these ongoing Japanese-focused campaigns, TA544 gradually began replacing Panda
payloads with Ursnif. The most recent Ursnif variants that TA544 uses to target Italian
audiences are derivatives of Ursnif 4000 (4777, 4778, 4779, 4780; collectively referred to as
4XXX).

Campaigns
TA544 campaigns that target Japan often distribute messages with payment-themed subject
lines such as:
"Re: 請求書の送付" ("Send invoice")
"Re: 請求書送付のお願い" ("Request for billing")
"契約書雛形のご送付" ("Sending the contract form")
"ご案内[お支払い期限:06月18日]" ("Information [Payment Deadline: Jun. 18]")
"請求書の件です。" ("Invoice")
"請求書送付" ("Invoicing")
8/14

These messages often contain a short, generic message about upcoming payment
deadlines, and typically contain Microsoft Excel Documents with macros, that when enabled,
download and install URLZone and/or Ursnif 1000. These Excel document file names are
usually a random collection of numbers:
"12345_0001.xls" (random digits)
"1234_56_007.XLS" (random digits)
"0001_123_4567.XLS" (random digits)

download and install URLZone which leads to Ursnif 1000 (Japan, April 2019)
Some of these messages may also contain attached steganographic images of notable
Japanese pop culture references. These images contain scripts that can fetch and install
malware (usually URLZone or Ursnif 1000) from malicious websites controlled by TA544.

TA544 uses many of the same strategies to target Italian audiences. These campaigns utilize
simple social engineering mechanisms including payment themed subject lines.
Some examples of subject lines include:
"documenti sig."
"Fattura per bonifico"
"Fatturazione 123456" (random digits)
"fatture scadute"
These messages often contain a short, generic message about upcoming payment
deadlines, scanned invoices, or upcoming bill payments, and typically contain Microsoft
Excel Documents with macros, that when enabled, download and install Ursnif 4XXX. These
Excel document file names are usually a random collection of numbers paired with upcoming
dates:
"(9)__2019__03_8765432F.XLS" (random digit, month, random digits)
"20190321 D O C 98765_43.xls" (today's date, random digits)
"FtDiff0000 000000D_M_S_987654.XLS" (random digits)

Some of these messages may also contain attached or linked steganographic images of
notable Italian pop culture references. These images contain scripts that can fetch and install
an Ursnif payload from malicious websites controlled by TA544.

Conclusion
Since early 2017, TA544 has emerged as one of the most prolific and geographically focused
threat actors in the threat landscape, distributing tens of millions of malicious messages
across eight countries within the last two years. To date, TA544 has delivered more than six
unique malware payloads (in several variations of each) in high-volume campaigns
(hundreds of thousands of messages per day) to victims across western Europe and Japan.
Originally specializing in the Panda banking malware in Italy, it has since branched out to
Poland, Germany, Spain, and Japan, using a variety of other malware including Chthonic,
Smoke Loader, Nymaim, ZLoader, and finally URLZone in combination with Ursnif, both
banking Trojans. TA544 currently targets marketing/advertising, technology, and IT verticals
in Japan, and manufacturing and retail verticals in Italy.
Given their recent behavior, we can expect TA544 to remain a prominent threat in Japanese
and Italian geographies. There is no indication of TA544 abandoning their primary payload
delivery mechanism (malicious Microsoft Office VBA macros), although we have seen an
increase in the use of steganographic images.
