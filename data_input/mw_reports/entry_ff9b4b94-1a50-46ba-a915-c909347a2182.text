What are the Exchange Zero Days?
In case you have been hiding under a rock this past week (I wouldn’t blame you), here is a breakdown of what they are. You
may also hear people referring to the Exchange Zero Days as:
HAFNIUM (Original threat group who exploited the zero days, named by Microsoft)
Operation Exchange Marauder (Name given to the initial attack by Volexity, the company who first identified the zero
days)
From the original Microsoft post (I highly recommend reading this whole article) –
CVE-2021-26855 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send
arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.
CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is
where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability
to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.
CVE-2021-26858 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate
with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could
authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.
CVE-2021-27065 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate
with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could
authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.
It is important to note that these vulnerabilities exist on Microsoft Exchange Server, and does not affect
Microsoft Exchange Online users.

Further reading
There is further information about the zero days at Volexity’s original post and also at the Mandiant Managed Defence post.
A site named proxylogon.com has also been created. This is for CVE-2021-26855 and is then chained with CVE-2021-27065
which allows unauthenticated attackers to execute code on remote systems. The site shows an example of the exploit in
action.
Brian Krebs (KrebsOnSecurity) has released a basic timeline of the Exchange mass hack. This includes a timeline of when
companies first noted the issues to Microsoft, until the present date.

Post Exploitation Activities
After exploiting the above vulnerabilities, there have been a number of post exploitation actions seen.
As per the Microsoft post, the following post exploitation activities were seen from the HAFNIUM
group, after they dropped a webshell using the above vulnerabilities.
Using Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory
Using 7-Zip to compress stolen data into ZIP files for exfiltration
Adding and using Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export mailbox data
Using the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine reverse shell
Downloading PowerCat from GitHub, then using it to open a connection to a remote server
Downloaded the Exchange offline address book from compromised systems.
As per the Volexity post, the following post exploitation activities have been seen.

3/12

rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll / MiniDump lsass.dmp – Dump process memory of lsass.exe to obtain
credentials
PsExec – Windows Sysinternals tool used to execute commands on remote systems
ProcDump – Windows Sysinternals tool to dump process memory
WinRar – Command Line Utility Used archive data exfiltration
Webshells (ASPX and PHP) – Used to allow command execution or network proxying via external websites
Domain Account User Addition – Leveraged by attackers to add their own user account and grant it privileges to provide
access in the future
As per the Mandiant post, the following additional activity was seen.
net group “Exchange Organization administrators” administrator /del /domain.
This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations administrators group, beginning
with the Domain Controller in the current domain. If the system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local
computer.
Please take your time to read the Post-Exploitation Analysis section of this report from Huntress Labs.
There is an in depth write-up originating from the execution of a command that was detected and stopped by Windows
Defender. The thread then goes on until the attacker drops Mimikatz.
Please take your time to read the Post Exploitation section of this report from TrueSec. It has a number
of new post exploitation activities which have not been noted in other posts as of yet.
Please take your time to read this post from ESET – “Exchange servers under siege from at least 10 APT
groups” . It contains details of 10 threat groups using the exploits and behaviors they are known to exhibit.
Please take your time to read this post from DomainTools – “Examining Exchange Exploitation and its
Lessons for Defenders“. It contains a good write up especially in relation to attribution and detection.

DoejoCrypt aka DearCry Ransomware
Please continue to read information below before reading this section, if you have not done so already. On the 9th of March,
Ransomware named #DoejoCrypt aka #DearCry has started to target Exchange Servers via the exploits mentioned in this
blog.
There are number of well written, informative articles on the ransomware targeting Exchange Servers so far –
BleepingComputer article
TheRecord article
Twitter thread from Sophos explaining DearCry
DoejoCrypt / Dearcry samples are available at Malware Bazaar.
Thanks to James Quinn (who added some of the above samples to Malware Bazaar) for sharing the following :
Notes on the samples he found
AppAnyRun Run
As shared by Pete Bryan, the MSTIC feed has been updated. It includes some hashes related to DearCry ransomware seen
exploiting the Exchange vulnerabilities.
A number of Yara rules are available to detect DearCry / DoejoCrypt.
Sebdraven – Yara rule link.
Florian Roth / Nils Kuhnert – Yara rule link.

Reversing Labs – Yara rule link.

Mitigations and Detections
The below list is all the knowledge I have so far gathered for Mitigations and Detections against / for CVE-2021-26855, CVE2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065. This also includes some detections for known post exploitation tactics.

Microsoft
Microsoft Vulnerability Mitigation’s
Importantly, this tells you –
How to install the security update (This does not evict an attacker if they have already compromised the
system). It is also worth noting that if you are installing the upgrades manually, you must run the update from the
elevated command prompt. If you are running an older CU then what the patch will accept, you must upgrade to at
least the required CU as stated above then apply the patch.
If you see unexpected behaviors or your upgrade fails, please go to this link which advises how to troubleshoot.
If you are unsure of the patch levels of your Exchange Servers, use this script from Microsoft.
Interim mitigation’s if you are unable to patch Exchange Server 2013/16/19. This includes what they mitigate and
potential impact. (These do not fully protect against the attacks. As above, does not evict an attacker if
they have already compromised the system)
Microsoft have also provided the following –
All Microsoft scripts (NMAP script to identify if your systems are vulnerable to Exchange zero days and Powershell
script to check Windows event logs and Exchange logs for IOCs.) can now be found at this link.
Microsoft Safety Scanner designed to find and remove malware from Windows computers. Simply download it and run
a scan on Exchange Servers to find malware and try to reverse changes made by identified threats.

CheckMyOWA – Victim Notification Site
Thanks to Allison Nixon for sharing this
CheckMyOWA is a site from Unit221b. In the words of Allison “Re: The recent mass Exchange hacks, we’re
releasing a victim notification website. Can check via email or IP, but only discloses to people with a
provable association with the victim. Target audience is small businesses who haven’t already been made
aware.”
Check out the site here.

Volexity
Within the Volexity post they have a large list of indicators that it is recommended you search for. I am not going to include
them all here, as the list is too long. Please go to the post and review the Indicators of Compromise section and ensure
you check for them all.

Mandiant Managed Defense
Mandiant Advisory
Mandiant advise checking the following –
Child processes of C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\w3wp.exe on Exchange Servers, particularly cmd.exe.
Files written to the system by w3wp.exe or UMWorkerProcess.exe.
ASPX files owned by the SYSTEM user
New, unexpected compiled ASPX files in the Temporary ASP.NET Files directory

5/12

Reconnaissance, vulnerability-testing requests to the following resources from an external IP address:
/rpc/ directory
/ecp/DDI/DDIService.svc/SetObject
Non-existent resources
With suspicious or spoofed HTTP User-Agents
Unexpected or suspicious Exchange PowerShell SnapIn requests to export mailboxes
They also advise preserving the following artifacts for forensic analysis:
At least 14 days of HTTP web logs from the inetpub\Logs\LogFiles directories (include logs from all subdirectories)
The contents of the Exchange Web Server (also found within the inetpub folder)
At least 14 days of Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs, located in Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange
Server\v15\Logging\ECP\Server
Microsoft Windows event logs

Red Canary
Red Canary Intel have released a fantastic post which contains.
The different clusters of threat activity they are seeing
The detection analytics they used to detect them
The simple remediation steps you can take to start to remove this activity from your environment if you find it, whether
you’re a single administrator or a mature security team.

Cisco Talos
Cisco Talos Advisory
Cisco Talos have released a number of Snort rules which can detect / block the behavior as follows –
CVE-2021-26857 — 57233-57234
CVE-2021-26855 — 57241-57244
CVE-2021-26858 & CVE-2021-27065 — 57245-57246
CVE-2021-24085 — 57251
CVE-2021-27065 — 57252-57253
Html.Webshell.Hafnium — 57235-57240
There is also a ClamAV signature – Win.ASP.MSExchangeExploit
They importantly point out “All organisations using the affected software should prevent external access to port 443 on
Exchange Servers, or set up a VPN to provide external access to port 443. This will ensure that only authenticated and
authorized users can connect to this service. However, this action will only protect against the initial step of the attack.“

CISA
CISA Advisory
On top of the above recommendations from Cisco, the following advice from CISA is also important –
Block external access to on-premise Exchange:
Restrict external access to OWA URL: /owa/ .
Restrict external access to Exchange Admin Center (EAC) aka Exchange Control Panel (ECP) URL: /ecp/ .
Disconnect vulnerable Exchange servers from the internet until a patch can be applied.
Other international agencies have been releasing advice regarding the zero days.
Catalin Cimpanu shared on Twitter this list of International advisories regarding the Exchange Zero days.

CERT Latvia
The Latvian CERT have released a powershell script to detect webshells dropped by the recent zero days onto exchange
servers.
6/12

Nextron Systems
Nextron Systems have setup THOR Lite (a free forensics scanner) to scan for HAFNIUM indicators. See the blog post and
usage instructions here.
This includes this YARA rule written by Joe Hannon from Microsoft that looks for HAFNIUM indicators.

Recon Infosec
OSQuery hunt to look for systems where the ProcDump EULA has been accepted. This is important as attackers are using
Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory

Microsoft 365 Defender Hunting Queries
Microsoft have published a number of hunting queries, as follows.
Reverse shell loaded using Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine technique
Exchange Server IIS dropping web shells
Procdump dumping LSASS credentials
7-ZIP used by attackers to prepare data for exfiltration
Exchange PowerShell snap-in being loaded
Powercat exploitation tool downloaded
Exchange vulnerability creating web shells via UMWorkerProcess
Exchange vulnerability launching subprocesses through UMWorkerProcess
Base64-encoded Nishang commands for loading reverse shell

SIGMA Queries
Thanks to Florian Roth for sharing and creating these.
This includes two rules.
HAFNIUM Exchange Exploitation Activity – Detects activity observed by different researchers to be HAFNIUM group
acitivity (or related) on Exchange servers.
Suspicious Service Binary Directory – Detects a service binary running in a suspicious directory.

Splunk Queries
Thanks to Jose Enrique Hernandez for sharing these on Twitter.
On the 12th of March, Splunk have released an updated blog post including further detection advice. Thanks to John Stoner
for sharing this.

SOC Prime (SIEM detection’s to translate to various languages)
Thanks to Ring3API for sharing these on Twitter. Free rules which can be converted to various SIEM languages.

Azure Sentinel (Sysmon) and M365D queries to detect anomalous network connections made by the
servers.
Thanks to Mehmet Ergene for creating and sharing these.
Link to the query logic here.

Further Azure / Defender query to detect exploitation of Exchange vulnerabilities.
Thanks to James Quinn for creating and sharing these.
Link to the query logic here.

Elastic Queries / Write-Up

7/12

Thanks to Austin for sharing this.
This is the full write-up from elastic which I missed in my original blog post. It contains a number of detection logic’s, see the
detection section of the article.
On the 11th of March, Elastic have updated their post with the following –
Some TTP’s include:
Network enumeration/discovery
Credential dumping of Windows Registry
Leveraging makecab utility to compress files

Known Good Exchange Hashes
Thanks to John Lambert for sharing this.
Hashes provided by Microsoft Exchange team.
Hashes provided by NCCGroup

Sysmon Config
As shared by Emir Erdogan there is a Sysmon config file that can be used for your Exchange servers, to aid in detections.

Further Detection Ideas
These are detection ideas which I am gathering over time from twitter.
As shared by Samir – “Multiple instances of w3wp.exe with cmdline containing “MSExchange*AppPool” spawning
WerFault.exe could be also an indicator of failed exploitation attempts.”
As shared by Joseph – “If you find you are compromised with the latest Exchange exploit, take moment and check for
any new users is your domain that “appeared” after compromise. Try running this script to seehttps://pastebin.com/raw/cr01VuCa“
As shared by Kevin look for the following – “Large amounts of internal SMB traffic from Exchange Server. Also look for
Scheduled task called Winnet on Exchange Server”
As shared by Tyler be careful when checking your POST requests – “Anyone searching for/responding to Exchange
attacks, one of the key indicators is POST to /ecp/<singleletter>.js. DO NOT JUST LOOK FOR singleletter!!!! Seeing a
bunch going to /ecp/program.js!”
As shared by Randy – “AzureSentinel pro tip: use the externaldata operator to grab IOC lists such as the one that
Microsoft is maintaining for HAFNIUM indicators (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/master/Sample%20Data/Feeds/MSTICIoCs-ExchangeServerVulnerabilitiesDisclosedMarch2021.csv…) and
use those values in your KQL queries”
As shared by John – “We haven’t confirmed lateral movement, but interesting to see scheduled tasks similar to the
“Sapphire Pigeon” tasks on non-Exchange hosts on the same network as a compromised Exchange server.”
As shared by Pete – “There are a few PoC scripts for Exchange exploits floating around (with varying validity) that
people may be trying to use for opportunistic exploits. One of the PoCs has hard coded elements you can hunt for in
logs” See further details in the twitter thread here.
As shared by Huy – “A good use-case to alert on is, when someone is turning off Exchange auditing.” There is a
Sentinel detection for this here.

IOC List
There are numerous IOC’s contained within the Microsoft and Volexity reports. Here are some extra’s that I have came
across. These are either hosting badness or attempting the exploits.
Bad Packets have shared the following:
Active CVE-2021-21972 payload: http://www.lingx[.]club/javac
