Microsoft consistently tracks the most advanced threat actors and evolving attack
techniques. We use these findings to harden our products and platform and share them
with the security community to help defenders everywhere better protect the planet.
Recently, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) observed the evolution of
attacker techniques by an actor we call GADOLINIUM using cloud services and open
source tools to enhance weaponization of their malware payload, attempt to gain
command and control all the way to the server, and to obfuscate detection. These attacks
were delivered via spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments and detected and
blocked by Microsoft Defender, formerly Microsoft Threat Protection (MTP), and able to
be detected using Azure Sentinel.
As these attacks were detected, Microsoft took proactive steps to prevent attackers from
using our cloud infrastructure to execute their attacks and suspended 18 Azure Active
Directory applications that we determined to be part of their malicious command &
control infrastructure. This action helped transparently protect our customers without
requiring additional work on their end.
GADOLINIUM is a nation-state activity group that has been compromising targets for
nearly a decade with a worldwide focus on the maritime and health industries. As with
most threat groups, GADOLINIUM tracks the tools and techniques of security
practitioners looking for new techniques they can use or modify to create new exploit
methods.

Recently, MSTIC has observed newly expanded targeting outside of those sectors to
include the Asia Pacific region and other targets in higher education and regional
government organizations. As GADOLINIUM has evolved, MSTIC has continued to
monitor its activity and work alongside our product security teams to implement
customer protections against these attacks.
Historically, GADOLINIUM used custom-crafted malware families that analysts can
identify and defend against. In response, over the last year GADOLINIUM has begun to
modify portions of its toolchain to use open-source toolkits to obfuscate their activity and
make it more difficult for analysts to track. Because cloud services frequently offer a free
trial or one-time payment (PayGo) account offerings, malicious actors have found ways to
take advantage of these legitimate business offerings. By establishing free or PayGo
accounts, they can use cloud-based technology to create a malicious infrastructure that
can be established quickly then taken down before detection or given up at little cost.
The following GADOLINIUM technique profile is designed to give security practitioners
who may be targeted by this specific actor’s activity insight and information that will help
them better protect from these attacks.

2016: Experimenting in the cloud
GADOLINIUM has been experimenting with using cloud services to deliver their attacks
to increase both operation speed and scale for years. The image in Figure 1 is from a
GADOLINIUM controlled Microsoft TechNet profile established in 2016. This early use of
a TechNet profiles’ contact widget involved embedding a very small text link that
contained an encoded command for malware to read.

2018: Developing attacks in the cloud
In 2018 GADOLINIUM returned to using Cloud services, but this time it chose to use
GitHub to host commands. The image in Figure 2 shows GitHub Commit history on a
forked repository GADOLINIUM controlled. In this repository, the actors updated
markdown text to issue new commands to victim computers. MSTIC has worked with our
colleagues at GitHub to take down the actor accounts and disrupt GADOLINIUM
operations on the GitHub platform.

2019-2020: Hiding in plain sight using open source
GADOLINIUM’s evolving techniques
Two of the most recent attack chains in 2019 and 2020 were delivered from
GADOLINIUM using similar tactics and techniques. Below is a summary view of how
these attacks techniques have evolved followed by a detailed analysis of each step that
security practitioners can use to better understand the threat and what defenses to
implement to counter the attacks.

Weaponization
In the last year, Microsoft has observed GADOLINIUM migrate portions of its toolchain
techniques based on open source kits. GADOLINIUM is not alone in this move. MSTIC
has noticed a slow trend of several nation-state activity groups migrating to open source
tools in recent years. MSTIC assesses this move is an attempt to make discovery and
attribution more difficult. The other added benefit to using open-source types of kits is
that the development and new feature creation is done and created by someone else at no
cost. However, using open source tools isn’t always a silver bullet for obfuscation and
blending into the noise.
Delivery & Exploitation (2019)
In 2019, we discovered GADOLINIUM delivering malicious Access database files to
targets. The initial malicious file was an Access 2013 database (.accde format). This
dropped a fake Word document that was opened along with an Excel spreadsheet and a
file called mm.accdb.core which was subsequently executed. The file mm.accdb.core is a
VBA dropper, based on the CactusTorch VBA module, which loads a .NET DLL payload,
sets configuration information, and then runs the payload. Defender for Office 365
detects and blocks malicious Microsoft Access database attachments in email. A redacted
example of the configuration is displayed below.

Command and Control (2019)
Having gained access to a victim machine the payload then uses attachments to Outlook
Tasks as a mechanism for command and control (C2). It uses a GADOLINIUM-controlled
OAuth access token with login.microsoftonline.com and uses it to call the Outlook Task
API to check for tasks. The attacker uses attachments to Outlook tasks as a means of
sending commands or .NET payloads to execute; at the victim end, the malware adds the
output from executing these commands as a further attachment to the Outlook task.
Interestingly, the malware had code compiled in a manner that doesn’t seem to be used in
the attacks we saw. In addition to the Outlook Tasks API method described above, the
extra code contains two other ways of using Office365 as C2, via either the Outlook
Contacts API (get and add contacts) or the OneDrive API (list directory, get and add a
file).
Actions on Objective (2019)
GADOLINIUM used several different payloads to achieve its exploitation or intrusion
objectives including a range of PowerShell scripts to execute file commands
(read/write/list etc.) to enable C2 or perform SMB commands (upload/download/delete
etc.) to potentially exfiltrate data.
LazyCat, one of the tools used by GADOLINIUM, includes privilege escalation and
credential dumping capability to enable lateral movement across a victim network.
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects the privilege escalation technique used:

LazyCat performs credential dumping through usage of the MiniDumpWriteDump
Windows API call, also detected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:

Delivery (2020)
In mid-April 2020 GADOLINIUM actors were detected sending spear-phishing emails
with malicious attachments. The filenames of these attachments were named to appeal to
the target’s interest in the COVID-19 pandemic. The PowerPoint file (20200423-sitrep92-covid-19.ppt), when run, would drop a file, doc1.dotm. Similarly, to the 2019 example,
Microsoft Defender for Office detects and blocks emails with these malicious PowerPoint
and Word attachments.
Command and Control (2020)
The malicious doc1.dotm had two payloads which run in succession.
The first payload turns off a type
check DisableActivitySurrogateSelectorTypeCheck which the second stage
needs as discussed in this blog.
The second payload loads an embedded .Net binary which downloads, decrypts +
runs a .png file.
The .png is actually PowerShell which downloads and uploads fake png files using the
Microsoft Graph API to
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drive/root:/onlinework/contact/$($ID)_1.png:/con
tent where $ID is the ID of the malware. The GADOLINIUM PowerShell is a modified
version of the opensource PowershellEmpire toolkit.
Actions on Objectives (2020)
The GADOLINIUM PowerShell Empire toolkit allows the attacker to load additional
modules to victim computers seamlessly via Microsoft Graph API calls. It provides
a command and control module that uses the attacker’s Microsoft OneDrive account to
execute commands and retrieve results between attacker and victim systems. The use of
this PowerShell Empire module is particularly challenging for traditional SOC monitoring
to identify. The attacker uses an Azure Active Directory application to configure a victim

endpoint with the permissions needed to exfiltrate data to the attacker’s own Microsoft
OneDrive storage. From an endpoint or network monitoring perspective the activity
initially appears to be related to trusted applications using trusted cloud service APIs and,
in this scenario,, no OAuth permissions consent prompts occur. Later in this blog post, we
will provide additional information about how Microsoft proactively prevents attackers
from using our cloud infrastructure in these ways.
Command and Control—Server compromise
GADOLINIUM campaigns often involve installing web shells on legitimate web sites for
command and control or traffic redirection. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects web
shells by analyzing web server telemetry such as process creation and file modifications.
Microsoft blogged earlier in the year on the use of web shells by multiple groups and how
we detect such activities.

Figure 6: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts of suspicious web shell attacks.
Web shell alerts from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be explored in Azure Sentinel
and enriched with additional information that can give key insights into the attack.
MSTIC’s Azure Sentinel team recently published a blog outlining how such insights can
be derived by analyzing events from the W3CIISLog.
Microsoft’s proactive steps to defend customers
In addition to detecting many of the individual components of the attacks through
Microsoft’s security products and services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and
for Microsoft Defender for Office as described above, we also take proactive steps to
prevent attackers from using our cloud infrastructure to perpetrate attacks. As a cloud
provider, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to disrupt this attacker technique. The
PowerShell Empire scenario is a good example of this. During April 2020, the Microsoft
Identity Security team suspended 18 Azure Active Directory applications that we
determined to be part of GADOLINIUM’s PowerShell Empire infrastructure (Application
IDs listed in IOC section below). Such action is particularly beneficial to customers as
suspending these applications protects all customers transparently without any action
being required at their end.)
As part of Microsoft’s broader work to foster a secure and trustworthy app ecosystem, we
research and develop detection techniques for both known and novel malicious
applications. Applications exhibiting malicious behavior are quickly suspended to ensure
our customers are protected.
GADOLINIUM will no doubt evolve their tactics in pursuit of its objectives. As those
threats target Microsoft customers, we will continue to build detections and implement
protections to defend against them. For security practitioners looking to expand your own
hunting on GADOLINIUM, we are sharing the below indicators of compromise (IOCs)
associated with their activity.
