This video covers a life cycle of an Emotet infection, including initial infection, command-andcontrol traffic, and spambot activity sending emails with malicious spreadsheet attachments
to infect new victims.
The video was recorded in a Windows Sandbox in order to avoid accidentally infecting my
Windows PC with malware.
Initial Infection
Palo Alto's Unit 42 sent out a tweet with screenshots and IOCs from an Emotet infection in
early March. A follow-up tweet by Brad Duncan linked to a PCAP file containing network
traffic from the infection on Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net.

Emotet Download
The PCAP from Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net shows that the Excel spreadsheet attachment
caused the download of a DLL file classified as Emotet.

Emotet Command-and-Control
Just seconds after the Emotet DLL download completes the victim machine starts
communicating with an IP address classified as a botnet command-and-control server.

Emotet Spambot
The victim PC eventually started sending out spam emails. The spam bot used TLS
encryption when possible, either through SMTPS (implicit TLS) or with help of STARTTLS
(explicit TLS).

Transmitted Spam
Below is a spam email sent from the victim PC without TLS encryption. The attached zip file
contains a malicious Excel spreadsheet, which is designed to infect new victims with Emotet.
