A Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been targeting Taiwanese financial
institutions as part of a "persistent campaign" that lasted for at least 18 months.
The intrusions, whose primary intent was espionage, resulted in the deployment of a backdoor
called xPack, granting the adversary extensive control over compromised machines, Broadcomowned Symantec said in a report published last week.
What's notable about this campaign is the amount of time the threat actor lurked on victim
networks, affording the operators ample opportunity for detailed reconnaissance and exfiltrate
potentially sensitive information pertaining to business contacts and investments without raising any
red flags.

In one of the unnamed financial organizations, the attackers spent close to 250 days between
December 2020 and August 2021, while a manufacturing entity had its network under their watch
for roughly 175 days.
Although the initial access vector used to the breach the targets remains unclear, it's suspected that
Antlion leveraged a web application flaw to gain a foothold and drop the xPack custom backdoor,
which is employed to execute system commands, drop subsequent malware and tools, and stage
data for exfiltration.
Additionally, the threat actor used C++-based custom loaders as well as a combination of legitimate
off-the-shelf tools such as AnyDesk and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to gain remote access,
dump credentials, and execute arbitrary commands.
"Antlion is believed to have been involved in espionage activities since at least 2011, and this
recent activity shows that it is still an actor to be aware of more than 10 years after it first
appeared," the researchers said.

The findings add to a growing list of China-linked nation-state groups that have targeted Taiwan in
recent months, what with malicious cyber activities mounted by threat actors tracked as Tropic
Trooper and Earth Lusca striking government, healthcare, transportation, and educational
institutions in the country.
