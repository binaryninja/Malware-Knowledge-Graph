QAKBOT Loader Returns With New Techniques and
Tools

QAKBOT is a prevalent information-stealing malware that was first discovered in 2007. In
recent years, its detection has become a precursor to many critical and widespread
ransomware attacks. It has been identified as a key "malware installation-as-a-service"
botnet that enables many of today’s campaigns.
Toward the end of September 2021, we noted that QAKBOT operators resumed email spam
operations after an almost three-month hiatus. Specifically, we saw that the malware
distributor “TR” was sending malicious spam leading victims to SquirrelWaffle (another
malware loader) and QAKBOT. In early October, the same “TR” distributor was reportedly
conducting brute-force attacks on Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) services, and
there is also speculation from security researchers that “TR” uses ProxyLogon to acquire
credentials for the attacks.
The actors using QAKBOT are leveraging hijacked email threads in their spam runs, a highly
effective tactic that was used by groups such as Emotet in the past (hijacking an email
thread means reviving an old thread with replies containing malware). Compromising IMAP
services and email service providers (ESPs), or hijacking email threads allows attackers to
leverage the trust a potential victim has in people they have corresponded with before, and it
also allows for the impersonation of a compromised organization. Indeed, intended targets
will be much more likely to open emails from a recognized sender.
Unlike the waves of QAKBOT that we observed in the weeks leading up to its June 2021
break, this most recent campaign uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros alongside
Excel 4.0 macros. In the following, we dive into the tools and techniques of this new edition
and include a thorough analysis of QAKBOT’s history and previous tactics in our technical
brief.

QAKBOT operators are a key enabler for ransomware attacks. Since 2019, infections have
led to the eventual deployment of human-operated ransomware families (MegaCortex and
PwndLocker in 2019, Egregor, and ProLock in 2020, and Sodinokibi/REvil in 2021).
Its reemergence in September is likely a signal of the initial infection of hosts. In the coming
weeks, the operators might try to monetize some of these infections using ransomware.
However, it is important to note that although QAKBOT activity is generally an initial
investigation of targets by known malicious groups, not all QAKBOT infections will lead to
serious ransomware incidents.
How does the newest version of QAKBOT operate with VBA macros?
When a victim opens the malicious file in their spam email, an auto_open macro will try to
create a new sheet and set the font color to white. Macros typically execute as soon as the
victim opens the document and selects the “Enable Content” button. It reads data embedded
in a form control “UserForm1”, which is revealed to be the following:

embedded in the form
The macro then assigns the values to cells in “Sheet 5” and evaluates and concatenates the
command to download the QAKBOT DLL from a remote host. The process chain has also
altered slightly with regsvr32.exe using -silent instead of -s parameter. The DLL download
URL still uses now() to form the DLL name. The macro then deletes the “Sheet5” when the
document is closed.

Security recommendations
The constant resurgence of new, more sophisticated variants of known malware, as well as
the emergence of entirely unknown threats, demands solutions with advanced detection and
response capabilities. Users can protect themselves from new QAKBOT samples and other
threats that spread through emails by following some of these best practices:
Avoid downloading attachments or selecting embedded links from emails before
verifying the sender and the content.
Hover the pointer above embedded links to show the link’s target.
Check the identity of the sender. Unfamiliar email addresses, mismatched email and
sender names, and spoofed company emails are some of the signs that the sender has
malicious intent.
If the email claims to come from a legitimate company, check if they sent it before
taking any action.
Users can also protect systems through managed detection and response (MDR), which
utilizes advanced artificial intelligence to correlate and prioritize threats, determining if they
are part of a larger attack. It can detect threats before they are executed, thus preventing
further compromise.
