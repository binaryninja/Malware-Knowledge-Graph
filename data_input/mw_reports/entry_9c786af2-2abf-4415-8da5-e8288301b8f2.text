May 2 Stormous update: The Trustwave SpiderLabs team has noted Stormous’
underground website became inaccessible on April 29. At this time it is not known why the
site is down. We will continue to monitor for additional threat intelligence.

As part of our regular Dark Web and cybercriminal research, Trustwave SpiderLabs has
uncovered and analyzed postings from a politically motivated, pro-Russian ransomware
group named Stormous. The group has recently proclaimed support for Russia in its war
with Ukraine, attacking the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and allegedly obtaining and
making public phone numbers, email addresses, and national identity cards. But the group
also claims to have a successful ransomware operation and has taken responsibility for
cyber attacks on major American brands Coca-Cola, Mattel and Danaher. In total, Stormous
claims to have already accessed and defaced 700 U.S. websites and attacked 44 American
companies.
As of April 29, the group has listed the Coca-Cola data for sale on its Dark Web site. At the
time of publishing, Coca-Cola has neither confirmed nor denied whether the data listed is
legitimate. Most recently, the gang has promised to release additional stolen information
from multinational toy manufacturer Mattel and medical diagnostics and healthcare
technology company Danaher on May 1.

Who Is Stormous and Where Does Its Allegiance Lie?
Stormous, which may have begun operating as early as mid-2021, has posted a mission
statement stating its objective is to attack targets in the U.S. and other western nations.
This goal shifted in 2022, adding Ukraine and India to its target list. The way they discuss
countries as their targets as opposed to specific businesses or industries suggests that
politics more influence these shifts in targets than financial gain.

Our initial analysis of Stormous indicates the gang likely has members located in MidEastern countries and Russia. Some of the group's postings are written in Arabic along
with its public pro-Russian stance, which is consistent with the region. Moreover, two of the
group's members that were arrested were from mid-eastern countries.

The group communicates through a Telegram channel and an .onion website on Tor. There
is little chatter on the Telegram channel, with the conversation mainly comprised of the
group’s proclamations. While the group identifies itself as a ransomware group, it is not
operating as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), and it’s not known what type of
ransomware it may be using in their campaigns
The group's motivating principles and behavior somewhat resemble the Lapsus$ hacker
group, which targets entities mainly in the Western hemisphere. Like Lapsus$, Stormous is
quite “loud” online and looks to attract attention to itself, making splashy proclamations on
the Dark Web and utilizing Telegram to communicate with its audience and organize to
determine who to hack next.
Click-Bait or Serious Business?
Stormous has stated that on May 1, it will put up for sale data allegedly exfiltrated from toy
manufacturer Mattel and Danaher, a global science and technology innovator. However, the
group did not define the type or amount of data it had taken, and neither Mattel nor Danaher
reported suffering a related cyber incident.
Stormous has already claimed responsibility for an alleged attack on the Coca-Cola Corp
that it claims garnered 161GB of data. The group began selling the data on April 24 for 1.6
BTC, or about $64,000.

name accounts.
The soft drink giant has confirmed that it has contacted law enforcement and is
investigating a cyber incident but has so far offered no details on what might have
transpired, according to Security Week.
The screenshot from Stormous site shows that the data it sells includes files with names
such as accounts.zip and passwords.txt. If those files indeed contain the content that their
names imply, then that content can be used by hackers for exploring additional ways to
connect to Coca Cola's networks in an unauthorized way.

There is some debate within the cybersecurity community on the validity of Stormous’
claims, specifically in relation to the Coca-Cola hack. The community questions whether or
not the group has truly breached the companies named and exfiltrated data or if it’s merely
scavenging previously stolen or public information. For example, Mattel announced in
November 2020, that it had been successfully hit by a ransomware attack earlier that year.
The Stormous attackers could be simply compiling this already stolen data and packaging it
as a ‘new’ breach in an attempt to earn quick money.
Stormous has also claimed to have successfully attacked several targets in India and Saudi
Arabia and possibly a Chinese government site.

Stormous is also representative of another recent trend that sees threat actors creating a
"corporate-like" structure and business model. In this case, perhaps because Stormous is
relatively new to the scene, its postings and communications appear to be a brand-building
exercise. Also, by pre-announcing the availability of supposedly stolen data, the group is
trying to hype demand as any company might do with a new product. Finally, by taking a
political stance, it likely hopes to attract supporters with similar viewpoints.
Politically Motivated Targeted Attacks
Stormous has posted its support for Russia and is claiming to have attacked the Ukraine
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, obtaining and making public phone numbers, email addresses,
and national identity cards. However, this attack, like the others, has not been corroborated.

Stormous' actions are not unique. Since the Russia-Ukraine war started on Feb. 14, threat
groups have been lining up to support each side. Trustwave SpiderLabs reported on this
activity soon after hostilities broke out.
Multiple sources have used Facebook and other social media outlets to try and gather a
force to conduct these attacks. Most notably, Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity
company in Kyiv, told Reuters he wrote a post calling for underground cyber defenders at
the request of a senior Ukrainian Defense Ministry official who contacted him.
Trustwave SpiderLabs has observed similar calls to cyber arms on the Dark Web. These
include links to groups organizing to attack Russian entities, sites containing instructions on
how to conduct a DDoS attack, and a recommended DDoS attack target list.

The Stormous group has also signaled that it won’t stand by and allow other entities, such
as ransomware groups, to attack Russia. Stormous has declared it will respond to any
attack against Russia, noting that if the attacks on Russia stop then, Stormous will halt its
efforts.

A note from the Stormous Telegram channel
A New Age of Cybercriminal
9/10

The new style of threat group Stormous represents, being unafraid of -- and in fact seeking
public adulation -- can make its members more susceptible to being found and arrested.
While there may be an upside from a clout and branding perspective to making hacking
activities public, law enforcement can use communications information to bring
cybercriminals more swiftly to justice.
Trustwave SpiderLabs will continue to track the threat of Stormous and group’s activities as
more information becomes available.
