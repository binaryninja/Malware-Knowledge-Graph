THE RSA HACK

Executive Summary
In March of 2011, a spear-phishing email containing an Excel spreadsheet with an embedded
malicious Adobe Flash payload led to a serious security breach at security firm RSA. This breach
allowed attackers to compromise the integrity of the RSA SecurID authentication system.
Attackers subsequently used information obtained via this breach in attacks against military
contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman and L-3 Communications.
The phishing email originated from a spoofed email address that bypassed reputation-based
email filtering, contained a Flash zero-day exploit for which no patch or IPS/AV signature existed
and thus was able to penetrate all network perimeter and system-level defenses. Given that
Adobe Flash has a history of serious security vulnerabilities and that client applications are
notoriously difficult for companies to patch, it is highly likely that other zero-day Flash
vulnerabilities will be discovered and used in attempts to penetrate other organizations. Because
malicious payloads can be deeply embedded, traditional signature-based network methods are
generally ineffective against this type of threat. Given that it serves virtually no business purpose
to embed Adobe Flash content inside Microsoft Office documents, detecting and/or excising such
content from payloads is recommended.

Threat Overview
The RSA hack consisted of three stages. The first stage was a spear-fishing email containing an
Excel spreadsheet with an embedded, malicious Flash object. The second stage was the
establishment of remote access via a Poison Ivy reverse tunnel. The third stage involved an
unspecified series of internal privilege escalations and the eventual compromise of the RSA
SecurID system. (Poison Ivy will be covered in a separate Fidelis Threat Advisory; few specifics
are known about the methods used by the attackers to penetrate RSA’s network after the initial
breach, so this FTA describes only the initial exploitation.)

The malicious Flash object contained a zero-day exploit for which no patch existed and for which
there were no AV/IPS signatures. The vulnerability was later assigned CVE number
CVE-2011-0609. The email came from a spoofed email address that bypassed email security
gateway appliances. Once on the system, the malware downloaded a specialized Poison Ivy
toolkit and established a reverse tunnel. Attackers then used this reverse tunnel to mount further
attacks.

Risk Assessment
Microsoft Office and Adobe Flash are ubiquitous, and while Office is relatively easy for most
organizations to patch, Adobe Flash is far more challenging. Even if an organization were perfect
with their patches, the exploit used in this case was a zero-day: it exploited an unknown and
unpatched vulnerability. Given the ease by which the malware was able to evade traditional
network defenses and given that it led to a serious enough breach of RSA’s SecurID system that
they were forced to reissue millions of tokens, the threat of a similar type of attack is extremely
serious.

Indicators & Mitigation Strategies
Given the relatively high number of recently discovered Flash vulnerabilities and Adobe’s poor
application security track record, it is likely that another zero-day vulnerability will be utilized in
this type of attack. Signature-based defenses will thus be of negligible use against cutting-edge
threats. The unusual packaging of the threat is its greatest weakness: there exist few legitimate
uses for a Microsoft Office document with embedded Flash and thus we recommend detecting
and/or excising such an uncommon file when it appears in network streams.

The Fidelis Take
Fidelis has made a rule available to customers that detects and/or blocks Adobe Flash content in
Microsoft Office documents when transmitted over the network. This rule is effective regardless of
protocol, the degree of embedding, the vulnerability used, the delivery method chosen by the
attackers, or the level of sophistication behind the social engineering attempts.
