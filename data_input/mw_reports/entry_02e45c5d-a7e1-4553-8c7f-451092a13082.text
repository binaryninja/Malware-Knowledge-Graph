KurayStealer: A Bandit Using Discord Webhooks

Research by: Ashwin Vamshi and Shilpesh Trivedi
Uptycs' threat research team has recently discovered a new malware builder—a tool sold to
criminals to make it easier to build malware—we have named KurayStealer that has
password stealing and screenshot capabilities. KurayStealer is a builder written in Python
which harvests the passwords and screenshots and sends them to the attackers’ Discord
channel via webhooks. It is available as a free and commercial (VIP) software. This was
discovered through the intelligence monitoring rules in our threat intelligence systems. Based
on the source code and the OSINT intelligence, we have evidence that the creator of this
builder is of Spanish origin and has also started selling paid versions of password stealers
with added functionalities.
This blog post details the working of the KurayStealer and also shares insights into the
author behind this malware.

Discovery of KurayStealer
Uptycs threat intelligence systems detected the first sample of KurayStealer on 27 April
2022. Based on our OSINT research, this builder was first advertised on 23 April 2022 via
the Youtube and Discord handle carrying the name “Portu.”

KurayStealer Operation
The builder KurayStealer was identified in our intelligence systems on 27 April 2022 (hash 8535c08d7e637219470c701599b5de4b85f082c446b4d12c718fa780e7535f07) with filename
c2.py.
The builder was written in Python and works in Python 3.0 (a.k.a. "Python 3000" or "Py3k").
Upon execution, the builder checks for the universally unique identifier (UUID) using the
command “wmic csproduct get UUID” (see Figure 1).

This check is performed to verify the generated UUID matches the list of UUIDs in the
https://pastebin[.]com/raw/Hc9W90Ld to determine if the user is a free or VIP user (see
Figure 2 ).

Based on the free or VIP user and the input of the webhook, a file named DualMTS.py,
DualMTS_VIP.py is dropped in the machine. We have used the free version of the module for
demonstrating the functionality of the builder.
DualMTS.py attempts to replace the string “api/webhooks” with “Kisses” in BetterDiscord in
an attempt to bypass the protection and send webhooks seamlessly (see Figure 3).

The file DualMTS.py then attempts to take the screenshot of the machine using the python
module “pyautogui”. Alongside this, it also takes the geo-location of the machine. The
snippet of this operation is shown in the figure below (see Figure 4).

It also harvests the passwords and tokens from a list of 21 software packages as follows:
Discord, Lightcord, Discord PTB, Opera, Opera GX, Amigo, Torch, Kometa, Orbitum,
CentBrowser, 7Star, Sputnik, Vivaldi, Chrome SxS, Chrome, Epic Privacy Browser, Microsoft
Edge, Uran, Yandex, Brave, Iridium
The harvested information including computername, geo-location, ipaddress, credentials and
the screenshot of the victim machine is sent over to the Discord channel via webhooks (see
Figure 5).

Uptycs EDR armed with YARA process scanning detected the KurayStealer with a threat
score of 10/10 (see Figure 6).

KurayStealer OSINT
Upon analyzing the builder code, we identified a snippet claiming the module was written
“Suleymansha & Portu.” While the builder claims to be written by Suleymansha & Portu, we
have seen several other similar versions floating around in public repositories like github.
Based on the working and implementation, the KurayStelaer builder has several components
of different password stealers using Discord tokens as command and control (C2) channels
for harvesting victim data.
The builder code also contained the Discord channel invite link
https://Discord[.]gg/AHR84u767J belonging to the creators behind this builder. The channel
mentions a post of the commercial version of this builder at different pricing options (see
Figure 7).

Upon looking into the channel, we found that the profile for the Discord user “portu” contains
a Discord channel name, Shoppy link, and YouTube link (see Figure 8).

We visited the YouTube link and identified the location of the user in Spain and found a video
demonstrating KurayStealer (see Figure 9).

Alongside this, the shoppy profile link of “Portu” contained several other tools the author
planned to create and their commercial offerings (see Figure 10).

At the time of this writing, the author has deleted the YouTube video from his channel. The
Discord channel of the authors also had an announcement on 26 April 2022 of a
ransomware in the making. Based on the announcement and the observations, we believe
that the authors might come up with newer versions of password stealers and other malware.

Conclusion
Our research on KurayStealer backed with OSINT highlights the rise in prevalence of
password stealers using Discord tokens as a C2 for harvesting the victims’ credentials.
Enterprises must have tight security controls and multi-layered visibility and security
solutions to identify and detect such attacks. Uptycs’ EDR correlation engine detected the
KurayStealer activity by correlating generic behavioral rules and YARA process scanning
capabilities.
