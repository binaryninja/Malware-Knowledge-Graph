A new malspam campaign is underway that is distributing a GlobeImposter variant that
appends the ..doc extension to encrypted files. This malspam is pretending to photos being
sent to the recipient and will have a subject line that starts in a similar way to "Emailing:
IMG_20171221_".

GlobeImposter MalSpam

These malspam emails contain7zip (.7z) archive attachments that are named after a camera
photo's filename such as IMG_[date]_[number]. These 7z files contain a obfuscated .js file
that when double-clicked on will cause the GlobeImposter ransomware to be downloaded
from a remote site and executed.
An example of this JS installer can be seen below.

Obfuscated JS Installer

After the executable is downloaded, it will be executed and the GlobeImposter ransomware
will begin to encrypt the computer. When encrypting files on the computer it will append the
..doc extension to encrypted file's name. For example, a file called 1.doc would be renamed
to 1.doc..doc.

Encrypted Folder

When GlobeImposter encrypts files it will also create a ransom note named
Read___ME.html in each folder a file is encrypted.

Ransom Note

This ransom note contains instructions to use Tor to go to the
http://n224ezvhg4sgyamb.onion/sup.php onion site. This site then tells you to contact them
to receive payment instructions and to decrypt one file for free. It also lists the email
server5@mailfence.com as a way to contact them.

Tor Payment Site

It also contains a link to a support site where you can send them a message.

Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt GlobeImposter files for free. For
support or help with this ransomware infection, you can ask in our dedicated GlobeImposter
Ransomware Support topic.

How to protect yourself from the GlobeImposter Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from the GlobeImposter Ransomware you should use standard
security practices. This includes using good computing habits and security software. First
and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be
restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware attack.
You should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat
ransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft AntiMalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent
many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases
are the most important steps of all:

6/8

Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them.
Enable the showing of file extensions.
If an attachment ends with .js, .vbs, .exe, .scr, or .bat, do not open them for any reason.
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral
detections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your
willing to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.

A big thanks to Eric Taylor of IT-Simplified for pointing out the malspam campaign.
