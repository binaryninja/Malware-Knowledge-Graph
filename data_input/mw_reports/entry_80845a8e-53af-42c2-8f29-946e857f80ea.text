During our regular threat hunting exercises, Cyble researchers discovered that threat actors are employing new attack vectors to target users
belonging to different sectors across the world. Based on a blog by 360 Core Security, we observed PJobRAT spyware samples disguised as
genuine dating and instant-messaging apps.
Our research was in line with the findings of 360 Core Security, and we found the spyware disguising as a famous dating app for Non-resident
Indians called Trendbanter and an instant messaging app called Signal. PJobRAT is a variant of spyware that disguises as a dating app
or an instant messaging app. It collects information such as contacts, SMSes, and GPS data. This RAT family first appeared in December
2019. PJobRAT is named after the structure of its code, which involves functions called ‘startJob’ or ‘initJob’ that initiate the malicious activity.
Based on a post on Twitter, the Cyble Research team came to know of 8 associated samples of the variant.

The malicious apps were seen using legitimate-looking icons of the genuine Trendbanter and Signal apps.

Upon further analysis, we found that PJobRAT is being displayed as a legitimate-looking WhatsApp icon on
the device’s home screen. However, the settings page clearly reveals the Trendbanner icon of the PJobRAT spyware app.

Technical Analysis
All the associated samples of PJobRAT have dangerous permissions for spying on the victim’s device. The application collects personally
identifiable information (PII) available in the victim’s device without the user’s knowledge and uploads the same to a C&C server. The malicious
activity starts immediately after the user starts the application. As showcased in figure 3, the application uses icons of legitimate apps to
hide itself from the home screen.
Dangerous Permissions
android.permission.READ_CONTACTS
android.permission.READ_SMS
android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS
android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE
The PJobRAT starts the malicious activity as soon as the user clicks on the application icon. The activity is initiated using initJobs function from
the application subclass that gets executed when the application starts, as shown in Figure 4.

The image below showcases the code through which sensitive PII is collected by the PJobRAT, along with the
process initiated by the Android JobService.

The following image shows the code that harvests the victim’s Contact List information from the Address Book.

As shown in Figure 7, the application collects selective documents with specific suffixes and uploads it to the C&C server.

The application also collects all the media files such as audio, video, and images available in the device, as shown in Figure 8.

PJobRAT also uses the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE to hook the Android window for reading the information associated
with WhatsApp such as WhatsApp contacts and messages, as shown in Figure 9.

Communication Details

Our research indicates that PJobRAT uses two modes of communication, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and HTTP. The application
receives commands from Firebase, as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 11 depicts the code with which the application uploads the collected data using HTTP to the C&C server.

Retrofit is another library that is used by some of the samples of PJobRAT for uploading user data.

Figure 12 Retrofit for C&C server Communication
Our analysis shows that PJobRAT uploads the following information from the victim device to the C&C server:
Contacts information
SMSes
Audio and video files
List of installed applications
List of external storage files
Documents such as PDFs, Excel, and DOC files
WiFi and GPS information
WhatsApp contacts and messages
All of the analyzed samples have the same code format and communicate with the same C&C server URLs. The C&C URLs are mentioned in
the below table.

Based on speculations by 360 Core Security, the PJobRAT spyware is allegedly targeting military professionals using dating apps and instant
messaging apps. In the past, military personnel have been victims of social engineering campaigns launched by crafty cybercriminals. In
addition, as a result of the latest privacy policy update by WhatsApp, the use of the Signal app has increased in India. We suspect that the
threat actor has leveraged this situation as an opportunity to deliver malicious applications. The Cyble research team is actively monitoring this
campaign and any activity around PJobRAT spyware.
Safety Recommendations:
Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.
Keep your system and applications updated to the latest versions.
Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
Download and install software only from trusted sites.
Verify the privileges and permissions requested by apps before granting them access.
