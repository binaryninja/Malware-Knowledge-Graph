ALPHV is a ransomware variant that encrypts data on infected systems and threatens to leak
stolen data if the ransom payment is not made. It is highly customizable, which enables
threat actors to easily tailor an attack to the target environment. ALPHV was first observed in
November 20201 and is believed to be the first active ransomware coded in the Rust
programming language.

What is ALPHV?
ALPHV is a strain of ransomware that encrypts files using AES encryption (although the
process can be overridden to use ChaCha20) and demands a large ransom for their
decryption. It is the only active ransomware developed using Rust, a programming language
renowned for its performance and safety. ALPHV has used Rust’s cross-platform capabilities
to develop both Linux and Windows variants of the ransomware.
ALPHV is categorized as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), a business model whereby the
developers of the ransomware lease it to affiliates, who earn a portion of ransom payments
in exchange for executing a successful attack. ALPHV offers affiliates a larger revenue share
than many other RaaS operations, with affiliates earning 80% of payments up to $1.5 million,
85% of payments up to $3 million and 90% of payments over $3 million. The developers of
ALPHV typically recruit affiliates on Russian-speaking hacking forums.
To amplify the impact of an attack, ALPHV uses data exfiltration to put further pressure on
victims and increase their chances of a payout. During an attack, threat actors extract large
amounts of data from the compromised system and threaten to publish it on the ALPHV leak
site unless the victim pays the ransom.

ALPHV is one of a handful of ransomware groups that also threatens to DDoS victims that
fail to pay the ransom. ALPHV allegedly uses its own botnet to manually perform the DDoS
attacks. The group frames DDoS as an exclusive feature of sorts, available only to affiliates
who have generated more than $1.5 million in ransom payments.

The history of ALPHV
ALPHV was first detected in November 2021 and quickly claimed dozens of victims in the
first few months of operation.
It is likely that ALPHV is a rebrand of a ransomware group known as BlackMatter, which was
itself a rebrand of a group known as Darkside. It’s believed that these rebranding efforts may
be an attempt by threat actors to distance themselves from a costly development blunder
that allowed Emsisoft to create a free Blackmatter decryption tool.
Cybersecurity researchers originally named the ransomware ‘BlackCat’ after the image of an
inky feline that was depicted on every victim’s Tor payment site. However, in February 2021,
a representative of the group confirmed that its only official name is ALPHV.

Since ALPHV was first discovered, there have been 194 submissions to ID Ransomware, an
online tool that helps the victims of ransomware identify which ransomware has encrypted
their files. We estimate that only 25 percent of victims make a submission to ID
Ransomware, which means there may have been a total of 776 ALPHV incidents since the
ransomware’s inception. During this time, the group also published on its leak site the stolen
data of at least 40 organizations.

ALPHV ransom note
After the ransomware has been deployed and the encryption process is complete, ALPHV
drops a ransom note on the infected system. The ransom note is named after the apparently
random file extension that ALPHV appends to all encrypted files, and uses the following
naming format: ‘RECOVER-[RANDOM EXTENSION]-FILES.txt’.
The ransom note informs the target that their files have been encrypted and includes a link to
a .onion site where the victim can make payment. The note also includes examples of the
type of data that was stolen during the attack, along with threats that the data will be

published if the victim refuses to cooperate.
Below is a sample ALPHV ransom note:
>> Introduction
Important files on your system was ENCRYPTED and now they have “[REDACTED]”
extension.
In order to recover your files you need to follow instructions below.
>> Sensitive Data
Sensitive data on your system was DOWNLOADED and it will be PUBLISHED if you
refuse to cooperate.
Data includes:
[REDACTED]
– And more…
Private preview is published here: [REDACTED]
>> CAUTION
DO NOT MODIFY FILES YOURSELF.
DO NOT USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO RESTORE YOUR DATA.
YOU MAY DAMAGE YOUR FILES, IT WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT DATA LOSS.
YOUR DATA IS STRONGLY ENCRYPTED, YOU CAN NOT DECRYPT IT WITHOUT
CIPHER KEY.
>> Recovery procedure
Follow these simple steps to get in touch and recover your data:
1) Download and install Tor Browser from: https://torproject.org/
2) Navigate to: [REDACTED]

Who does ALPHV target?
ALPHV tends to target large organizations with the resources and motivation to pay large
ransom demands. It is capable of infecting both Windows and Linux systems.

4/8

ALPHV prohibits attacks on nations belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), which includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.
The group also prohibits attacks on government, healthcare and educational institutions. If
an entity belonging to one of these sectors is attacked, ALPHV claims that it will provide free
decryption and ban the offending affiliate.
As always, any claims made by cybercrime groups should be taken with a grain of salt.
ALPHV has already published stolen data from at least one victim in the healthcare sector
(the group has stated that its rules around avoiding the healthcare sector do not apply to
pharmaceutical companies and private clinics). Additionally, even if the group does provide
free decryption to an impacted entity, the recovery process may still take days, weeks or
months to complete. This level of disruption can have a significant impact on patient health.

How does ALPHV spread?
ALPHV attacks begin by breaching the target network. Affiliates can use a variety of methods
to infect the target system, including compromised RDP, phishing attacks, stolen credentials
and exploiting known vulnerabilities.
Once the system has been compromised, attackers may use a variety of tools to prepare the
environment for encryption and maximize the impact of the attack. Tools such as Mimikatz,
LaZagne and WebBrowserPassView are used to access saved passwords, which enable
threat actors to escalate privileges and spread laterally across the network. MEGAsync is
often used to exfiltrate data, while anti-forensics tools like File Shredder are sometimes used
to securely delete files and thwart analysis. PowerShell is often used to modify Windows
Defender security settings and shadow volume copies are deleted prior to encryption to
prevent organisations from restoring encrypted files.
ALPHV requires a specific access token for the ransomware to execute properly. The access
token acts as a unique key, which is used to verify the identification of the victim and must be
provided when accessing the ALPHV .onion payment site. The access token prevents thirdparties (such as ransomware researchers) gatecrashing what is supposed to be a private
negotiation between victim and attacker.
As ALPHV operates as a RaaS and can be distributed by many different affiliates, the exact
anatomy of an attack can vary from incident to incident.

Major ALPHV attacks

5/8

Oiltanking: In late November 2021, German petrol distributor Oiltanking GmbH was
the victim of an ALPHV attack. The incident affected 13 fuel terminals, including the
automated systems responsible for loading and unloading fuel tanks, and forced the
company to resort to manual processes. More than 200 petrol stations, mostly located
in northern Germany, were impacted during the attack.
Swissport: In February 2022, Swissport, the world’s leading provider of ground
services and cargo handling for the aviation industry, was allegedly hit by ALPHV. The
group posted on its data leak site a small sample of files that were apparently stolen
during the attack, including passports, internal business notes and the personal
information of job candidates. The group also offered to sell the entire 1.6 TB set of
stolen data.

How to protect the network from ALPHV and other ransomware
The following practices may help organizations reduce the risk of an ALPHV incident.
Cybersecurity awareness training: Because the majority of ransomware spreads
through user-initiated actions, organizations should implement training initiatives that
focus on teaching end users the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Ransomware and
propagation methods are constantly evolving, so training must be an ongoing process
to ensure end-users are across current threats.
Credential hygiene: Practicing good credential hygiene can help prevent brute force
attacks, mitigate the effects of credential theft and reduce the risk of unauthorized
network access.
Multi-factor authentication: MFA provides an extra layer of security that can help
prevent unauthorized access to accounts, tools, systems and data repositories.
Organizations should consider enabling MFA wherever possible.
Security patches: Organizations of all sizes should have a robust patch management
strategy that ensures security updates on all endpoints, servers, and appliances are
applied as soon as possible to minimize the window of opportunity for an attack.
Backups: Backups are one of the most effective ways of mitigating the effects of a
ransomware incident. Many strains of ransomware can spread laterally across the
network and encrypt locally stored backups, so organizations should use a mixture of
media storage, and store backup copies both on- and off-site. See this guide for more
information on creating ransomware-proof backups.
System hardening: Hardening networks, servers, operating systems and applications
is crucial for reducing attack surface and managing potential security vulnerabilities.
Disabling unneeded and potentially exploitable services such as PowerShell, RDP,
Windows Script Host, Microsoft Office macros, etc. reduces the risk of initial infection,
while implementing the principle of least privilege can help prevent lateral movement.

6/8

Block macros: Many ransomware families are delivered via macro-embedded
Microsoft Office or PDF documents. Organizations should review their use of macros,
consider blocking all macros from the Internet, and only allow vetted and approved
macros to execute from trusted locations.
Email authentication: Organizations can use a variety of email authentication
techniques such as Sender Policy Framework, DomainKeys Identified Mail, and
Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance to detect email
spoofing and identify suspicious messages.
Network segregation: Effective network segregation helps contain incidents, prevents
the spread of malware and reduces disruption to the wider business.
Network monitoring: Organizations of all sizes must have systems in place to monitor
possible data exfiltration channels and respond immediately to suspicious activity.
Penetration testing: Penetration testing can be useful for revealing vulnerabilities in IT
infrastructure and employees’ susceptibility to ransomware. Results of the test can be
used to allocate IT resources and inform future cybersecurity decisions.
Incident response plan: Organizations should have a comprehensive incident
response plan in place that details exactly what to do in the event of infection. A swift
response can help prevent malware from spreading, minimize disruption and ensure
the incident is remediated as efficiently as possible.
