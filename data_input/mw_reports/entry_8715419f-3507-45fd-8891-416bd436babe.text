It’s true to say that there’s a lot lot less malware in existence for

Macs than there is for Windows PCs. But that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist at all.
And clinging onto the statistics of the much smaller proportion of Mac malware compared to
Windows malware is going to be cold comfort if your Apple Mac is the one which ends up
getting infected.
The latest Mac malware seen by the experts at SophosLabs, is a new variant of the
OSX/Imuler Trojan horse. In the past, earlier variants of the OSX/Imuler malware has been
spread via topless photos of a Russian supermodel or embedded deep inside boobytrapped
PDF files.
This time, it appears that the a version of the Imuler Trojan has been used in an targeted
attack against sympathisers of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government, as the malware
appears to have been packaged with images of Tibetan organisations.

If your Mac was successfully infected by malware like this, you have effectively given remote
control of your computer and your data to an invisible and unknown party. They could steal
files from your Mac, spy on your emails, and plant further malware onto your systems.
(It will be left as an exercise to the reader to come up with a shortlist of who might have an
interest in breaking into the computers of Tibetan organisations).
Customers of Sophos, including users of Sophos’s free anti-virus for Mac, are protected
against the malware which has been detected as a variant of the OSX/Imuler-B backdoor
Trojan since the early hours of 11th November 2012.
Users of other Mac anti-virus products may be wise to check with their vendors if they are
protected.
This new malware variant may not be widespread – but it is another indication that the
malware threat on Macs is real, and should not be underestimated.
