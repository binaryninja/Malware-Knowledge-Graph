Threat Intelligence from Hades Incident Response Engagements
When you talk about ransomware threat actors, the image that is conjured up is one of
ruthless mercenaries looking to make a quick buck. Unfortunately, much of the security
industry operates under this assumption, and perhaps fails to look at broader motives and
deeper breaches. Over the past two weeks, we have seen two posts from CrowdStrike and
Accenture respectively documenting the Hades Ransomware Gang. While we agree with
many of the technical conclusions in these posts and have observed many of the same tools,
we believe there is more to the Hades story. Our incident response engagements with Hades
and other threat actors has us increasingly convinced that ransom is not the only objective
for at least some of these gangs. With that perspective, we are engaging the community to
share our analysis. As we encountered the Hades threat actor, they appeared to exhibit a
number of characteristics that were at once unlike other ransomware gangs, almost
amateurish in a sense, while at the same time showing the type of sophistication and
obfuscation that is more the forte of nation-state based advanced persistent threats (APT).
Our “spidey sense” certainly went off but given the extremely limited threat intelligence on the
Hades ransomware gang across the community as a whole, it was difficult to paint the full
picture. However, as our experience with this threat actor has increased, we have been able
to identify a set of defining characteristics that lead us down the path of challenging the
conventional wisdom surrounding at least one ransomware gang. Perhaps the other gangs
have similar alternate motives that we have not collectively picked out.
In this post we will break down several aspects we saw during our incident response
engagements including:

Tactics and Tools
Forensic Practices
Intelligence Gaps
Detecting the Techniques
As you will see below, in responding to this threat actor we uncovered evidence tactics,
techniques and procedures that can be attributed to multiple sophisticated adversaries
including Hafnium group, the threat actor Microsoft says is behind the recent Exchange
Server hack. Based on a forensic timeline we built across multiple engagements, we believe
there is significant evidence that points to one of two possibilities:
An advanced threat actor is operating under the guise of Hades;
Multiple independent actors just coincidentally compromised the same environment,
potentially due to weak security practices in general.

Background
Arista’s Awake Labs’ incident response team had the opportunity to help several of the
organizations impacted by Hades with their incident response needs. Some may already be
familiar with the Hades Ransomware attack on Forward Air Trucking Giant Attack in
December 2020, however at the end of 2020 there were several other victims. With such a
limited number of publicly disclosed victims of the Hades group, we have a unique
perspective with data that has not been available to anyone else. As you will see below we
uncovered evidence of multiple nation-state and ransomware actors tools and techniques,
while at the same time observing behaviors that are uncharacteristic of a sophisticated
ransomware adversary.

Hafnium and Other Potential Connections to Hades
As we responded to multiple Hades ransomware attacks over the last few months, the lack
of logging and forensic data sometimes hampered our ability to identify the initial access
point into the network. The one exception being a possible Hafnium compromise. Our team
was pulled in after the compromise and encryption to review the situation and in this one
case a Hafnium domain was identified as an indicator of compromise within the timeline of
the Hades attack. Moreover, this domain was associated with an Exchange server and was
being used for command and control in the days leading up to the encryption event. The
domain, p[.]estonine[.]com/p?smb, was identified by a third party forensic firm first engaged
by the victim. Based on their analysis this domain was first seen in a Hades attack in
December 2020. Clearly at this point the vulnerability in Exchange had not been publicly
disclosed but this attack time frame aligns more closely with the DevCore vulnerability
discovery date. This clearly provides evidence of the attack prior to January 2021, which has
been the consensus until now.

In addition to Hafnium and the Hades gang, some victims showed evidence of other threat
actors. While we were not able to forensically determine the direct connection to the Hades
attacks, we are providing a summary of these discoveries in case this intelligence is relevant
to future Hades attacks.
TimosaraHackerTeam (THT) Tools and Techniques
Remnants of the TimosaraHackerTerm (THT) ransomware group, named after a town in
Romania, were identified in one or more environments, a few weeks prior to the Hades
attack. The THT situation mirrored almost exactly the details in a Sensors Tech Forum
Remove THT posting from March 2020. Awake Labs also saw the use of BestCrypt as
mentioned in a blog post by id-ransomware in June of 2018. In short, we saw the following
activities.
VSS Admin was used to clear shadow copies of the local machine
Bitlocker or BestCrypt (bcfmgr) was used for encryption on the local machines
External IP connection was made to Romania IP 185[.]225[.]19[.]240
For the THT IOCs, the IP address mentioned from Romania was observed between October
and November 2020 with malicious behavior and associated with two new files tracked on
VirusTotal.

Hades Gang: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
Industries and Geographies
Our analysis and intelligence shows that there was relatively a small number of organizations
that were hit by the Hades ransomware gang. While there could be more, it is interesting to
note that no other victims have been publicly identified in the media or via the known Hades
3/12

leak methods (more on this below).
The focus of this gang also appears to be mostly with a few industries. As mentioned above,
a logistics provider has been publicly mentioned as a victim. Our intelligence shows that
most of the other organizations have a focus in manufacturing, and more specifically those in
the automotive supply chain as well as those with insulation products.
The locations of the attack were slightly dispersed as each of the companies were global in
their operational footprints. While these organizations were impacted across multiple
geographies, we have evidence to suggest that the ransomware attack was focused on the
geographies below :
Canada
Germany
Luxembourg
Mexico
United States
While other ransomware gangs do target specific verticals, they usually run larger campaigns
where the goal is to compromise several organizations with the hope of higher payouts.
Hades’ relatively narrow targeting does stand out as unique comparatively.
Leak Sites
As incident responders know it is common for ransomware actors to set up leak sites for their
data, but what was interesting about Hades is that they used methods for both their leaks
and their drop sites that would likely be taken down within a very short time. There was very
little sophistication in this setup, something that stands apart from other ransomware actors.
For example, if you look up @hadesleaks on Twitter today you will see the response “No
results for “@hadesleaks”. However, as recently as December 2020 / January 2021, there
were a few victims mentioned including the trucking giant (Figure 2). Additionally, we
observed that this actor chose multiple different sites for their leaks, with the only consistency
being the Twitter account used to broadcast the message naming the victims.

4/12

Figure 2: hadesleaks Twitter
For instance, in the first posting on Dec 17th, the leak site “hackforums” was used (Figure 3).
But very quickly this site was rendered inaccessible within the forum.

5/12

Figure 3: hackforums Dec 17 leak
Eleven days later in their next post, we see the Hades gang use both pastebin and a mirror
hastebin (Figure 4). Both sites today say “This page is no longer available.” The pastebin
and the hastebin site were removed.
In both these sites we see the files hosted on “mega.nz,” a cloud storage provider, which we
will provide more context about later.

Figure 4: Pastebin Hades Leak site
As for the Twitter account, Awake Labs and several other organizations requested that it be
suspended. On or about January 1, 2021 the account was in fact suspended by Twitter
(Figure 5) leaving the actor to find other mechanisms to inform the world of its leaks. As of
this writing the account continues to be locked out.

Figure 5: Hadesleaks Twitter Captured on January 2, 2021
When we downloaded and looked at the data from the leak sites and compared it to what our
incident responders forensically identified as being exfiltrated, it appeared as if the data on
the leak sites was not the most consequential data the actor could have leaked. The data

6/12

chosen for the leak was a very limited set with little repercussions to the victims. Meanwhile
the exfiltrated data was very different containing large amounts of data focused on
manufacturing processes. The question that therefore arises, what was the objective of
stealing the crown jewels but disclosing less significant bits of information? Did they hold
back on publicly sharing the most valuable data because they had alternate means to
monetize the proprietary secrets?
We know the actor requested amounts in the range of $5 to $10 million of ransom and was
very slow to respond to some individuals. In some cases, they may not have responded at
all. In fact, one Twitter user even claimed “TA never responds.” If there were only a few
organizations attacked, why would it take so long to respond to requests for ransom? Was
there another potential motive here? Why haven’t we seen Hades since?

Forensic Practices
Resource Development
During our review, Awake was able to identify timestamps within the AppCompatCache that
showed binary modifications. The actor appeared to be compiling the ransomware binary at
the same time the data was exfiltrating out of the environment.
Execution
We identified execution of the malware, which was achieved via PsExec, through the
RecentApps entry, Registry Key LastWrite times and the creation of new services on the
remote systems it was run against.
The data we have also shows the usage of the tool winexesvc.exe in one environment which
has been used by other actors in the past for remote execution.

This software was seen initially executed on an Exchange system.
The Awake team had fun piecing together screenshot artifacts from the RDP bitmap cache
(Figure 6 and Figure 7) showing PsExec execution. We were able to validate:
The user account used to run PsExec and responsible for the service creation on
remote hosts
The option -p <blocked out password> would indicate the partial password for the
account was used
References to “PsEx” and “xec.exe” which are portions of PsExec
References to C:\data\PsE which we know was where PsExec was run from based on
the RecentApp entry
The option -s to run the remote process in the System account

8/12

The option -f to copy the specified program even if the file already exists on the remote
system

Figure 6: RDP Cache 1

Figure 7: RDP Cache 2
Credential Access
The threat actor also leveraged valid accounts throughout the environments showing there
was some level of compromise that enabled them to obtain privileged access. Awake was
able to use bitmap cache file entry for RDP typically located in the directory
\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache\

9/12

Awake was also able to see JumpList entries for RDP with the associated user id in the
directory
\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\
These artifacts exposed both service account and privilege admin accounts that were used
by the threat actor.
We also are aware of at least one environment where Mimikatz was used as a method to
extract credentials. This was the same environment with the file winexesvc.exe on the
Exchange system where the Hafnium domain was identified.

Discovery
Remote System Discovery was also conducted by the actors via the query session
command qwinsta. This command was identified with the Powershell ConsoleHost_history.txt
file. The qwinsta command is run to display information about sessions on a Remote
Desktop Session Host server.
Lateral Movement
Like many other attacks, administrator and service accounts were used by the actor with
PsExec to move lateral from system to system across domains to access and prep files for
exfiltration. The actor compromised accounts and then used RDP to navigate throughout the
organizations. Once the exfiltration was done, the actor then used PsExec to push the
ransomware that encrypted the environments.
Collection
The Hades actors searched local file systems and databases to find files of interest and
sensitive data prior to Exfiltration. They also searched and collected data from network
shares on remote systems. Common targets of this were accessible shared directories on
file servers. Awake identified these activities on multiple systems by analyzing the ShellBags
registry artifact.
For the archiving, the actor was identified downloading 7zip from a regular download site.
Awake also was aware of the WinRar utility’s use at some of the victim organizations. 7zip
leaves an archive history in the NTUSER.data registry hive, which provided the ArchHistory
value data which when parsed provides the file listings that were archived. The files listed in
the ArchHistroy were compared to files we knew were exfiltrated and they matched.
Exfiltration

10/12

The exfiltration methods that were concretely identified and used by the Hades gang are not
particularly new. For instance, we see in an article from July 2020 where the Mega[.]nz
application was used. In this case, we investigated and identified the Hades actor
downloading the standard Mega.nz application directly from its main site and using these
commonly available tools for exfiltration.
Impact
The actor in more than one instance was particularly destructive. There were several
confirmed instances where the actor issued commands such as “kill” to destroy the backup
storage systems, rendering the organization incapable of restoring from backup.
Outside of the backup destruction we saw the impact of the encryption across the Microsoft
Windows environment. With ransomware we know adversaries encrypt files in large numbers
across the network. This was similar in the Hades incidents, we identified cross domain
encryption and several different versions of the encryption software used in the Hades
incidents. At least one of the files was associated with Sodinokibi ransomware while the
others files appear to be associated with a Crypmodng signature.
