Summary
The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aware of a global Domain Name
System (DNS) infrastructure hijacking campaign. Using compromised credentials, an
attacker can modify the location to which an organization’s domain name resources resolve.
This enables the attacker to redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure and
obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names, enabling man-in-themiddle attacks.

Note: these files were last updated February 13, 2019, to remove the following three nonmalicious IP addresses:
107.161.23.204
192.161.187.200
209.141.38.71

Technical Details
Using the following techniques, attackers have redirected and intercepted web and mail
traffic, and could do so for other networked services.
1. The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through
alternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records.
2. Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name
Server (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the
attacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for
manipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they
choose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection.
3. Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption
certificates for an organization’s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be
decrypted, exposing any user-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the
domain, end users receive no error warnings.

Mitigations
NCCIC recommends the following best practices to help safeguard networks against this
threat:
Update the passwords for all accounts that can change organizations’ DNS records.
Implement multifactor authentication on domain registrar accounts, or on other systems
used to modify DNS records.
Audit public DNS records to verify they are resolving to the intended location.
Search for encryption certificates related to domains and revoke any fraudulently
requested certificates.
