Episode 16
Thank you for subscribing to Episode 16 of the HP Security Briefing. In this
edition we discuss the cyber landscape within the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea.
Introduction
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known in the West as North Korea, is a unique
country with a military-focused society and an unconventional technology infrastructure. While
North Korea was formerly on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, it was removed in 2008. 1
However, due to North Korea’s hostility toward other nations, its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and
human rights violations against its own citizens, the United Nations and many Western entities
have placed sanctions and embargoes against North Korea.2 3 For example, U.S. export laws
forbid the sale of dual-use technologies, or those that can be used or repurposed for both civilian
and military use, to North Korea.4 5 Additionally, the U.S. has a military alliance with the Republic of
Korea (ROK), known in the West as South Korea, North Korea’s primary target of conflict.6
Due to North Korea’s global interactions, its cyber warfare capabilities are of particular interest to
the U.S. According to a 2009 report by Major Steve Sin, an intelligence analyst at U.S. Forces
Korea, North Korean hackers have successfully penetrated U.S. defense networks more
frequently than any other country that has targeted U.S. defense assets.7 While Major Sin may
have been overly optimistic about North Korea’s abilities, it is clear that they should not be
underestimated. Frank Cilluffo, co-director of the Cyber Center for National and Economic Security
at George Washington University, testified before Congress that North Korea’s cyber capability
"poses an important 'wild card' threat, not only to the United States but also to the region and
broader international stability…"8 In an April 2014 testimony given to the House Armed Services
Committee, General Curtis M. Scaparrotti noted that “North Korea remains a significant threat to
United States’ interests, the security of South Korea, and the international community due to its
willingness to use force, its continued development and proliferation of nuclear weapon and longrange ballistic missile programs, and its abuse of its citizens’ human rights, as well as the
legitimate interests of its neighbors and the international community.” Scaparrotti stressed that
“While North Korea’s massive conventional forces have been declining due to aging and lack of
resources…North Korea is emphasizing the development of its asymmetric capabilities. North

Korea’s asymmetric arsenal includes…an active cyber warfare capability.”9 While one would expect
the regime’s digital infrastructure to also suffer from aging or lack of resources, these factors do
not take away from their technical abilities to wage cyber warfare.
While the U.S. views North Korea’s cyber warfare program as the regime’s foray into modern
asymmetrical warfare, South Korea views the regime’s cyber capabilities as a terroristic threat, -a
build-up for an impending multifaceted attack. It is important to note that, to date, no such attack
has occurred. According to a report written by Captain Duk-Ki Kim, Republic of Korea Navy officer
and Ph.D. “…the North Korean regime will first conduct a simultaneous and multifarious cyber
offensive on the Republic of Korea’s society and basic infrastructure, government agencies, and
major military command centers while at the same time suppressing the ROK government and its
domestic allies and supporters with nuclear weapons.”10 South Korea’s view of North Korea as a
terroristic threat may be an attempt to downgrade North Korea politically, since South Korea does
not recognize the regime as a legitimate state.11 South Korean reports also claim that North
Korea’s premier hacking unit, Unit 121, trails Russia and the U.S. as the world’s third largest cyber
unit. 12 While this claim may be exaggerated, in 2012, South Korean reports estimated North
Korea’s hacker forces at around 3000 personnel. In a July 2014 report from South Korea’s Yonhap
News Agency, that figure was upgraded to 5900 hacker elite.13 We must stress that although
these claims have not been corroborated, South Korea has taken the regime’s cyber threats very
seriously and is reportedly training 5000 personnel to defend against North Korean cyber
attacks.14
Obtaining details on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities is not an easy task. This paper will
examine the known cyber capabilities of North Korea’s regime and how the country maintains
secrecy in these matters. Through information obtained via open source intelligence (OSINT), we
will present what is known about North Korea’s cyber warfare and supporting intelligence and
psychological operations capabilities.

Research roadblocks
The following conditions proved to be research roadblocks when gathering intelligence regarding
North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities:
 Much of the intelligence available on North Korea is dated and may not accurately reflect
the regime’s current capabilities.
 Much of the intelligence available on North Korea comes from U.S. or South Korean
military or agency reports. These reports omit details that are likely classified, such as
specific IP addresses and individual actor information.
 While South Korea is an ally of the United States, its reports on North Korean cyber
activity potentially contain incomplete or biased information. Cultural factors that stem

from a history of tension and conflict between the two nations may skew perception and
make objectivity difficult. 15 16
North Korea’s Internet infrastructure and the regime’s strict control over its use ensures
that there are no rogue actors and that all officially sanctioned actors exercise careful
OPSEC and PERSEC practices in order to prevent inadvertent information leaks. In other
words, there was no significant identifying information in the form of an OSINT trail left
behind by the actors. This hinders collection of original, actionable threat intelligence and
individual actor attribution.
North Korea is well-isolated from the outside world, and its strong intelligence and
psychological operations presence effectively creates confusion via counterintelligence
and disinformation about the regime’s capabilities.17 For this reason, any “official” reports
emanating from North Korea must be taken with a grain of salt. This also hinders
attempts to obtain original, actionable threat intelligence.

Ideological and political context
In order for Westerners to understand the North Korean mindset, it is necessary to examine the
key components of North Korean political and ideological thought. It is also necessary to provide a
brief explanation of how North Korea and South Korea view one another, in order to understand
the basis for conflict between the two.

Juche and Songun
North Korea has two primary ideologies that provide context for the regime’s motivations and
activities: juche (ju-cheh) and songun (sun-goon). Juche is the official political ideology of North
Korea. It was instituted in 1972 and is based on the ideologies of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the
DPRK. Juche emphasizes self-reliance, mastering revolution and reconstruction in one’s own
country, being independent of others, displaying one’s strengths, defending oneself, and taking
responsibility for solving one’s own problems. North Korea’s air-gapped intranet, described below,
exemplifies this philosophy in the country’s cyber infrastructure. The juche philosophy explains
North Korea’s disdain for outside cultural and political influence. Juche challenges North Koreans
to contribute to the regime’s chaju (ja-ju), a concept of national sovereignty and independence.18
The regime’s greatest fear is internal dissent and resulting destabilization.19 20 In a June 2014
Reddit AMA session, Dr. Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korean culture and society, noted
“there are also serious signs of public alienation and discontent. And I cannot rule out a public
outbreak of such discontent in the near future. Of course, if it happens, it will have a serious
impact on the government.”21 Despite North Korea’s strong conviction in juche, the regime
collaborates with and receives support from other nations. However, due to this deep-seated

ideology, it is doubtful that North Korea fully trusts these apparent allies.22 Later in this document,
we will show that North Korea relies heavily on China for Internet access. North Korea also
collaborates with China and Russia to train its cyber warriors and has longstanding political and
military relationships with several nations.
Songun is North Korea’s “military first” doctrine. Songun emphasizes the priority of the military in
resource allocation and political and economic affairs. 23 This doctrine stems from the belief that
the military is vital for preservation of chaju.24 Understanding songun mindset gives context for
this potential threat actor’s motivations. According to a 2013 Congressional report, the strategy
established under former leader Kim Jong-Il focused on “internal security, coercive diplomacy to
compel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests, development of strategic
military capabilities to deter external attack, and challenging South Korea and the
U.S.-South Korean alliance."25
Songun is North Korea’s
North Korea’s songun permeates the lives of all North Korean citizens. Article 58 of
the North Korean Constitution states that the nation should base itself on a
nationwide defense system that includes all people.26 North Korea, with a
population of 25 million, has an active duty force of 1.19 million personnel, the
fourth largest in the world. The country’s reserve and paramilitary units comprise
7.7 million additional personnel.27 In other words, over a third of the country’s
population serves in a military or paramilitary capacity.

Children aged 14-16 can begin military training as members of the Young Red Guards, a
paramilitary unit. Beginning at age 17, North Koreans are eligible to join the Reserve Military
Training Unit.31 The Reserve Military Training Unit forms the core of North Korea’s reserves and is
typically assigned to the front or regional defense in wartime.32 The youngest age at which a
citizen can be conscripted for active duty is unclear; reported ages range from 18-20. Youths can
volunteer for active duty service at age 16 or 17.33 The Worker-Peasant Militia, or Red Guards,
includes males ages 17-60 and unmarried females ages 17-30 who are not part of active duty
units or the Reserve Military Training Unit.34
The regime has an impressive number of conventional weapons, considering the nation’s small
land area and population size.35 According to statistics released by CNN in 2014, North Korea’s
ground arsenal includes 4100 tanks, 2100 armored vehicles, and 8500 pieces of field artillery.
The regime’s sea weaponry includes 70 submarines, 420 patrol combatants, and 260 amphibious
landing craft. Their airpower includes 730 combat aircraft, 300 helicopters, and 290 transport
aircraft. While the limits of the regime’s ballistic missile program are unknown, North Korea is
thought to have fewer than 100 short-range missiles and fewer than 100 medium to long-range
missiles.36 However, in recent years, North Korea has suffered oil,37 fuel,38 electricity,39 and food40
shortages. Without aid from another entity, the regime does not have sufficient resources to
maintain and sustain the majority of its weapons and associated personnel for rapid deployment
or prolonged combat.

Tension and change on the Korean Peninsula
Tension between North and South Korea has continued well past the armistice meant to end the
Korean War. Neither nation recognizes the other as a legitimate state. South Korea’s constitution
legally defines South Korean territory as the entire Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands, with
“North Korea” being a part of South Korea. 41 North Korea also claims to be the sole government
of the Korean Peninsula.42 Each country’s claim of sovereignty and refusal to acknowledge the
other as a legitimate state creates the condition for perpetual conflict. North Korea’s negative
sentiment towards the U.S. stems from two major factors: the U.S. – South Korea military alliance
and North Korea’s perception that the U.S. is imperialistic and prone to exploitative capitalism. 43

In recent years, two primary factors have heavily influenced the current state of North Korea’s
relations with South Korea and her allies: the rise of the regime’s leader Kim Jong Un and the
inauguration of South Korean president Park Guen Hye. Kim Jong Un officially rose to power in
April 2012, following the death of his father Kim Jong Il in December 2011. While his age
remained a mystery for quite some time, it was later revealed that he was born in January 1983,
making him age 31 at present. This makes Kim Jong Un the world’s youngest leader of an
established nation.44 The young leader’s rise to power brought about several changes in North
Korea. First, Kim Jong Un’s personal life is more public and more extravagant than that of his
father. Unlike his father, the young Kim is often accompanied by his wife when making public
appearances.45 Second, the young Kim, who is more high-tech than his predecessor, is reported to
have an affinity for luxury items46 and is an avid gamer and basketball fan.47 Third, Kim Jong Un is
more totalitarian than his father. Following his rise to power, the regime reportedly expanded its
labor camps, and more military resources were allocated to target those attempting to defect.
Kim also executed his own uncle, a high-ranking official who did not share his ideals. These moves
indicate the regime’s priority to deter internal destabilization and dissent, which is perceived to be
a greater threat than outside adversity. According to Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at
Human Rights Watch, “The government now recognizes that the accounts of escaping North
Koreans reveal Pyongyang’s crimes – so it is doing what it can to stop people from fleeing.”48
Under Kim Jong Un’s rule, the regime has stepped up its nuclear materials production, and the
propaganda distributed by state media has become more menacing.49
The regime’s response to perceived threats has also become more volatile. Christian Whiton, a
former deputy envoy to North Korea, noted that following Kim Jong Un’s rise to power, “the
regime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random.”
Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, assessed the situation thusly: “Since [Kim Jong Un] took power he has purged almost all
of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we
are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which
is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before.”50 The regime’s
recent reaction to an upcoming film supports these statements. The plot for the comedy film “The
Interview” follows two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The regime
even sent a complaint about the movie to the UN.51 In response to the film, a North Korean official
stated, “The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt
the dignity of the supreme leadership.” The official referred to the movie as "the most undisguised
terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their
mental mainstay and bring down its social system.” The official also issued a threat: “If the U.S.
administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and
merciless countermeasure.”52 This reaction demonstrates North Korea’s priority of preserving the

regime’s self-perceived dignity in the global arena and its intolerance of any disrespect directed at
the Kim family.
While tensions between North and South Korea have persisted since the Korean War, these
tensions escalated following the 2013 inauguration of South Korea’s current president, Park Geun
Hye. Her platform, in her words, is as follows: “North Korea must keep its agreements made with
South Korea and the international community to establish a minimum level of trust, and second
there must be assured consequences for actions that breach the peace. To ensure stability,
trustpolitik should be applied consistently from issue to issue based on verifiable actions, and
steps should not be taken for mere political expediency.”53 Shortly after Park’s inauguration,
North Korea denounced UN Security Council Resolution 2094, which is “a resolution strengthening
and expanding the scope of United Nations sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea by targeting the illicit activities of diplomatic personnel, transfers of bulk cash, and the
country’s banking relationships, in response to that country’s third nuclear test on 12 February
[2013].”54 North Korea also responded strongly to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises in
March 2013, as is noted later in this paper.55

North Korean cyber capabilities and limitations
North Korean infrastructure
North Korea’s cyber infrastructure is divided into two major parts: an outward-facing Internet
connection and a regime-controlled intranet. North Korea’s outward-facing Internet connection is
only available to select individuals and is closely monitored for any activity that is deemed antiregime. Individuals using the outward-facing Internet connection must be authorized. In 2013,
Jean H. Lee, the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, stated that foreigners visiting North
Korea are allowed Internet access with no firewalls.56 Common citizens are limited to using the
Kwangmyong (gwang me-young), a nationwide intranet with no access to the world outside North
Korea. 57 According to Lee, Kwangmyong allows citizens “access to the state media, information
sources that are vetted by the government, and picked and pulled from the Internet and posted to
their intranet site.”58 As of May 2013, North Korea had only one “Internet café.”59 A 2003 report
from the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive stated that North Korea’s “Internet
café” was “the only place in North Korea for the public to access the Internet” and that foreigners
were allowed to access the Internet from this café.60 Whether citizens are allowed to access the
Internet from this location is unknown.
Star Joint Venture Co. is responsible for providing North Korea’s Internet access. Star Joint Venture
Co. was established by the Post and Telecommunications Corporation in cooperation with Loxley

Internet address allocation. Previously, Internet access was provided by a German satellite link via
Korea Computer Center Europe or via direct connections with China Netcom, which was later
merged into China Unicom. 62 By October 2010, North Korea had made its first known direct
connection to the Internet, hosting an outward-facing Korean Central News Agency website
accessible from the global Internet. 63 However, many of North Korea’s globally accessible
websites are hosted in other countries. In 2001, South Korean reports indicated that North Korea
had joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).64 As of April
2012, North Korea reportedly used the Intelsat connection, which appeared in border gateway
protocol (BGP) announcements.65 Some reports referred to the Intelsat connection as North
Korea’s backup Internet connection, in case the China Unicom connection fails.66 A March 2013
post on the blog rdns.im showed that North Korea no longer used the Intelsat connection. In the
blog post, the author noted his method for proving that The Pirate Bay was not hosted in North
Korea. While his analysis of The Pirate Bay’s hosting is irrelevant to our research, he did detail that
175.45.177.0/24 always routes through AS4837, and AS131279. AS131279 is Star-KP, North
Korea’s Star Joint Venture Company, and AS4837 is China Unicom. The author concluded that “all
[traffic] is ONLY routed through China Unicom and NOT through Intelsat.”67 In February 2014,
North Korean and South Korean officials agreed to extend Internet access to Kaesong Industrial
Zone, a jointly operated industrial complex just north of the border. However, this would likely
require a major electrical and network infrastructure expansion.68
North Korea’s electrical grid cannot support a large technological infrastructure.69 Electrical
power is reported to be unreliable and sporadic, with many citizens only receiving a few hours of
electricity per day.70

power grid, in comparison with surrounding nations.71 We have highlighted North Korea in red.
Koryolink, the country’s only cellular phone network,72 is tightly controlled by the regime.73 Cell
phone data plans are not available to most users. Most cellular phones cannot access the
Internet and can only make domestic calls.74 According to a 2013 report, North Korea has a 3G
data network for cellular phones. Visiting reporter Jean H. Lee purportedly used this 3G network
to post to both Twitter and Instagram. However, citizens are not generally allowed to use the 3G
network.75
Email is also regulated by the regime. The first email provider in North Korea was Silibank. Silibank
has servers in Pyongyong and Shenyang and is a joint venture with China. The North Korean
Silibank homepage is silibank.net, and the Chinese homepage is silibank.com. In order to use the
email service, users had to initially register, provide personal information, and pay a registration
fee and monthly service fees.76 This registration information was current as of 2001. However, it
is unknown whether the same process still applies.
WHOIS records for silibank.net show that the site was registered anonymously via a Japanese
registrar. This information can be found in Appendix A at the end of this paper.

Korea Computer Center (KCC) is North Korea’s leading government research center for
information technology. KCC has eleven regional information centers and eight development and
production centers. Other countries with KCC branch offices include China, Syria, Germany, and
United Arab Emirates. KCC has a vested interest in Linux research and is responsible for the
development of North Korea’s national operating system, Red Star OS, which is discussed in more
detail below. KCC’s other projects have included a proprietary search engine, a document writer, a
game called Jang-Gi, the Kwangmyong intranet, a food study program, a Korean input method
editor, a pen-based English-Korean and Korean-English translator, Korean voice recognition
software, a video conferencing system, a distance education system, SilverStar Paduk software,
HMS Player77, and the Samjiyon tablet. 78 In addition to research and development, KCC also
monitors websites of foreign government and business entities and conducts technical
reconnaissance to blueprint the technical specifications and vulnerabilities in foreign systems and
technologies. KCC has also been involved in clandestine information and cyber operations, serving
as a command center.79
North Korea’s proprietary operating system is Red Star OS. The development of this Linux-based
operating system started in 2002. Red Star OS is only offered in the Korean language and
features proprietary software including Naenara (a Firefox-based browser), as well as a text
editor, email client, audio and video players, and games.80 Red Star OS’s keyboard layouts include
Korean, English, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese. Regime ideals extend to Red Star OS. The
readme file, which goes with the installation disc, reportedly includes a quote from Kim Jong-Il
regarding the importance of North Korea having its own Linux-based operating system that is
compatible with Korean traditions. While prior versions of Red Star were KDE-based, version 3.0
mimics Apple’s OS X.81 82 This could indicate the regime leader Kim Jong Un’s preference for the
OS X environment, as Kim reportedly uses an iMac.83 Citizens do not need permission to obtain
Red Star OS. However, the purchase of computers is heavily regulated.84 The OS’s design suggests
it was developed with means for the regime to monitor user activity.85
North Korea is known to use two IP ranges. 175.45.176.0/22 is North Korea’s own IP block.86
Additionally, North Korea’s Telecommunications Ministry is the registered user of China Unicom IP
range 210.52.109.0/24.87 The country’s only autonomous system (AS) number is AS131279, and
its only peer is AS4837, the AS for China Unicom.88
North Korea’s country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is .kp. In 2007, the .kp TLD was initially
delegated to and administered by the German-based KCC Europe.89 After KCC Europe failed to

Various U.S., U.N, and other sanctions prohibit export of dual-use technologies to North Korea. In
light of this, North Korea has managed to develop both hardware and software and hosts an
annual National Exhibition of Invention and New Technologies to promote its products.92 However,
the regime has historically failed in its attempts at large-scale production of electronic
components. The country’s sparse electrical grid is one of the major obstacles hindering largescale manufacturing.93 Additionally, the famine in the early 1990’s negatively impacted existing
manufacturing facilities, and the regime simply does not have the capital to modernize those
factories.94 A member of the World International Property Organization (WIPO), North Korea joined
the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty that protects patents and trademarks worldwide, and
leverages intellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean
inventions.95 The regime, in its efforts to isolate its citizens from Western influence, leverages
intellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean inventions.96
This is ironic since foreign-made electronic components are sometimes smuggled into North
Korea for military use and for personal use by the regime’s upper echelon.

An analysis of developments in North Korean cyberspace since 2010
A comparison of a scan97 of North Korea’s IP ranges in November 2010, just one month after
North Korea made its first direct connection to the Internet, and a series of several scans we
conducted in May 2014, shows that North Korea has made significant headway in establishing its
Internet presence.
In the November 2010 scan, 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.176.16 showed a variety of devices including
D-link, Cisco, Linksys, HP, and Nokia devices, and a Juniper networks firewall. Operating systems
detected included FreeBSD 6.x, Linux 2.6.x, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 175.45.176.14 returned
“Naenara” as an html-title. Most hosts in the 175.45.176.xx and 175.45.177.xx ranges were
down. As of 2014, IP addresses 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.177.255 appear to be used for websites,
nameservers, databases, email, and voice over IP (VoIP). In November 2010, the 175.45.178.xx
range showed all hosts down,98 and the 175.45.179.xx range showed most hosts were down.99

In 2014, several webservers and nameservers were found in the 175.45.178.xx range, and
several nameservers and mail servers were found in the 175.45.179.xx range. This comparison
demonstrates that there has been some growth in DPRK Internet infrastructure over the past four
years. However, it seemingly lags behind even most third world nations. The 2014 scans detected
dated technology that is potentially susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities and consistently
showed the same open ports and active devices on scanned hosts. It is not clear whether the
regime failed to notice and react to the scanning or whether the regime allows these open ports
and devices to be detected or spoofed to serve as a distraction or possible honeypot.
Domains, nameservers, and mail servers present during the May 2014 scan are listed in Appendix
B at the end of this report.
According to Alexa rankings, the three most visited websites in North Korea are kcna.kp, the
official website of the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)100; rodong.rep.kp, another North
Korean news site101; and naenara.com.kp, North Korea’s official web portal.102 Naenara translates
to “my country”.
The kcna.kp site was registered using a Loxley.co.th email address and is administrated by Star

North Korean cyber war and intelligence structure
At the top of North Korea’s military structure is the National Defense Commission (NDC). The NDC
is also the highest branch of government and the regime’s supreme policymaking body. 111 Along
with the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the Cabinet, NDC is at the top of

110
111

http://www.ournation-school.com/
https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/dprk-security-apparatus/national-defense-commission/

North Korea’s political hierarchy.112 Article 106 of North Korea’s Constitution gives the NDC the
following powers:113
 The power to establish policies of the state in accordance with the military-first
revolutionary line.
 The power to guide the armed forces and oversee defense building.
 The power to supervise and ensure the NDC and its chairman’s orders are executed and to
establish necessary measures.
 The power to override any state decisions or directives that are in opposition to the NDC
or its chairman’s decisions and directives.
 The power to create or remove central organs of the national defense sector.
 The power to create and bestow military titles above general-grade officer rank.
The NDC oversees several defense and intelligence bodies including the Ministry of State Security,
the Ministry of People’s Security, the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, and the Korean People’s
Army. The Ministry of State Security (MSS), also known as the State Security Department, is North
Korea’s primary counterintelligence service. It is considered an autonomous agent of the regime
and reports directly to leader Kim Jong Un. The MSS’s duties include oversight of North Korean
prison camps, investigation of domestic espionage, repatriation of defectors, and overseas
counterespionage operations.114 The Ministry of People’s Security is also known as the Ministry of
Public Security (MPS). Focused on domestic order, it oversees North Korea’s national police force,
conducts criminal investigations and preliminary examinations, and oversees correctional
facilities, excluding prison camps.115 While the roles of the MSS and MPS focus more on
intelligence than on cyber operations, the MSS also reportedly has a communications monitoring
and computer hacking group.116

Pyongyang.120 Unit 121 comprises both an intelligence component and an attack component. Unit
121’s headquarters is in the Moonshin-dong area of Pyongyang, near the Taedong River.121 It also
has components that conduct operations from within China. One of Unit 121’s command posts is
Chilbosan Hotel122 in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, which borders North Korea.123
Shenyang is a Chinese military district.124 According to Dr. Alexandre Mansourov, an expert on
North Korea and a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, "They
[Unit 121] are believed to have conducted hacking operations from inside China that falsify
classified data and disrupt U.S. and South Korean systems."125 Both Unit 121 and an entity known
as Lab 110 are reported to maintain technical reconnaissance teams responsible for infiltrating
computer networks, hacking to obtain intelligence, and planting viruses on enemy networks.126 127

The Liaison Department of the Worker’s Party oversees a faction of ethnic North Koreans residing
in Japan who are critical to North Korea’s cyber and intelligence programs. This group, which was
established in 1955, is referred to by various names including the Chosen Soren, Chongryon, and
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.136 The Chongryon ascribe to juche and seek
to preserve North Korean culture while living in Japan. They operate North Korean style schools
and refuse to assimilate with Japanese culture.137 According to Mitsuhiro Suganuma, former
section head of the second intelligence department of the Japanese Public Security Intelligence
Agency (PSIA), “Chongryon is virtually under the direct control of the Liaison Department of the
Workers’ Party of Korea, which has been in charge of North Korea’s covert operations and
underground activities against South Korea. Chongryon in Japan has been a strong support
organization aimed at bringing a revolution in South Korea, or a red unification by force.” He also
stated “North Korea will continue to make Chongryon serve as Pyongyang’s pawn in covert
operations against South Korea.”138 The Chongryon are vital to North Korea’s military budget,
raising funds via weapons trafficking, drug trafficking, and other black market activities.139 The
group also forms “front companies” abroad that benefit the regime by generating
“Chongryon is virtually
hard currency. One example is Unikotech, which was formed to sell KCC products
under the direct control of
abroad. 140 The Chongryon’s underground group known as the Gakushu-gumi, or
the Liaison Department of
the Workers’ Party of Korea,
“the study group”, gathers intelligence for North Korea and helps the regime

against South Korea.”
The regime also has several government bodies under the Cabinet142 that oversee
its infrastructure, intelligence, and technological development. These include the
Central Scientific and Technological Information Agency (CSTIA), the Ministry of Electronics
Industry, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The CSTIA collects, analyzes, and
processes data regarding advanced science and technology then sends relevant information to
appropriate areas of the national economy.143 The amount of information contained in CSTIA's
technical database makes it North Korea's largest scientific facility. According to a CIA article,
review of CSTIA’s publications showed that China, Russia, and Japan are important sources of
technical data. CSTIA’s publications include newsletters and an 18-volume science and

North Korean cyber and intelligence organizational chart

Figure 13 North Korean cyber and intelligence organizational chart

North Korea’s cyber doctrine, strategies and goals
North Korea’s cyber warfare doctrine has not been clearly stated. However, based on cultural and
technical observations, we may deduce that North Korea’s cyber doctrine follows the tenets of
juche nationalism and the songun doctrine.
Although North Korea’s limited online presence makes a thorough analysis of their cyber warfare
capabilities a difficult task, it must be noted that what is known of those capabilities closely
mirrors their kinetic warfare tactics. Cyber warfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea’s
long history of asymmetrical warfare. North Korea has used various unconventional tactics in the

past, such as guerilla warfare, strategic use of terrain, and psychological operations.146 The
regime also aspires to create viable nuclear weapons.147 Asymmetrical warfare is defined as “a
conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact
and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve
strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the ‘weaker’ combatants attempting to use
strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality”. 148
According to the aforementioned report to the House Armed Service Committee, “Cyber warfare is
an important asymmetric dimension of conflict that North Korea will probably continue to
emphasize — in part because of its deniability and low relative costs.”149 North Korea’s poor
economic state150, further explains the regime’s reliance on these tactics. In 2014, the regime
reportedly spent 16% of its budget on defense.151 The North Korean military places a strong
emphasis on information warfare capabilities including political and psychological warfare152 and
cyber or hacker warfare.153
The report by Capt. Duk-Ki Kim, Ph.D. highlighted North Korea’s counter-asymmetric strategy and
ranked each based on intensity and frequency:

Cyber warfare operations
Just ten years ago, experts noted that North Korea was one of the “least network-ready and most
isolated societies on the planet.”155 Today North Korea’s air-gapped networks and prioritization of
resources for military use provide both a secure and structured base of operations for cyber
operations and a secure means of communications.156 North Korea’s hermit infrastructure creates

a cyber-terrain that deters reconnaissance. Because North Korea has few Internet connections to
the outside world, anyone seeking intelligence on North Korea’s networks has to expend more
resources for cyber reconnaissance.157 A 2003 article by the U.S. Office of the National
Counterintelligence Executive assessed that “Development of the nation, rather than
empowerment of the individual, appears to be driving DPRK efforts to develop domestic IT
infrastructure and industry.”158 In November 2013, Kim Jong Un referred to cyber warfare
capabilities as a “magic weapon” in conjunction with nuclear weapons and missiles.159
According to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean defector and former computer science professor,
the regime has the following motivations for expanding its cyber warfare capabilities:160




Cyber capabilities are a cost-effective way to offset North Korea’s lack of kinetic military
prowess.
North Korea’s school systems place a strong emphasis on math, giving the nation
confidence in its programmers, cryptographers, and security researchers.
In the modern warfare landscape, cyber capabilities are potentially more utilitarian than
heavy artillery or aircraft.
Cyber warfare capabilities provide a platform for espionage, psychological operations,
and other forms of non-kinetic warfare.
Considering the separatist nature of North Korea’s infrastructure, cyber warfare provides
a strategic advantage since outbound attacks are possible, but inbound attacks would
have limited reach.
Cyber warfare allows North Korea to leverage the Internet’s inherent flaws for offensive
purposes while maintaining its defenses, primarily via air-gapping its most critical
networks from the outside world.

North Korea’s attack and defense capabilities reportedly include the following cyber warfare and
electronic warfare components: offensive cyber operations (OCO); computer network operations
(CNO), which includes both computer network attack (CNA) and computer network exploitation
(CNE); distributed denial of service (DDoS);161 satellite monitoring; drones; GPS jamming
capabilities162; and deployment of electromagnetic pulse (EMP).163 North Korea’s OCO and CNO
capabilities became apparent as early as 2004, when North Korea reportedly gained access to 33
of 80 South Korean military wireless communication networks. In June 2006, an attack on the U.S.
State Department originating in the East Asia-Pacific region coincided with U.S.-North Korea
negotiations over the regime’s nuclear missile testing.164 A month later, a South Korean military
report implicated North Korea’s Unit 121 in hacking the South Korean and U.S. Defense
Departments. North Korea also tested a logic bomb in October 2007. A logic bomb is malicious

code programmed to execute based on a pre-defined triggering event. Following the logic bomb
test, the UN passed a resolution banning sales of certain computer hardware to North Korea.165
North Korea considers its cyber warfare capabilities an important asymmetric asset in the face of
its perceived enemies, the U.S. and South Korea. While North Korea does not have an immersive
digital culture, both the U.S. and South Korea are heavily dependent upon technological
infrastructure for social, economic, and political stability.166 For this reason, a cyber attack that
cripples or compromises the reliability of the U.S. or South Korea’s technological infrastructure
could have a far-reaching impact.

Gaming for profit and pwnage
North Korea has reportedly used computer games for both illegal capital gain and
North Korea has used

orchestrating cyber attacks.
According to South Korean reports, the culprits used an auto-player to quickly
progress in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) “Lineage” and were
able to use the game’s market to obtain real currency.168 In 2013, South Korean officials released
information stating they had found evidence that North Korea was using games as a medium for
infecting machines and launching cyber attacks. North Korea had used game downloads to infect
100,000 South Korean machines for a botnet used to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack against Incheon Airport.169 This clever tactic sought to leverage a seemingly innocent game
as a force multiplier in order to amplify the effects of a DDoS attack on a critical infrastructure
target. However, in this case, there was little impact on the target.

Intelligence and counterintelligence
North Korea’s intelligence program is one of its strongest military assets, providing foundational
support for all other military operations. The regime’s cyber warfare capabilities, in particular, rely
heavily on open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection and cyber-espionage. 170 As noted in a CIA
publication, "It is a significant irony of our information age that open-source intelligence is
contributing to the survival and development of one of the world's most secretive regimes."171
Historically, the primary goals of the regime’s intelligence program included collection and
dissemination of intelligence concerning any possible political, military, or economic threat to the
regime’s security and stability. Secondary goals have included "acquisition of foreign military and
civilian technologies and equipment, support of the DPRK’s foreign policy goals, training and

support for foreign revolutionary and terrorist organizations, and the acquisition of foreign capital
for state and intelligence operations."172
North Korea has a broad reach for intelligence collection, which extends to cyber intelligence.173
In April 2013, Solutionary, a company providing managed security services, reported a marked
increase in both overt attacks and information gathering attempts originating from

month are traced to North Korean origin. This is an interesting claim, considering
that attacks attributed to North Korea are usually routed through other countries.
As mentioned above, a faction of ethnic North Koreans residing in Japan, known as the Chongryon,
are critical to North Korea’s cyber and intelligence programs and help generate hard currency for
the regime. The Chongryon headquarters has been recognized as the de facto North Korean
embassy in Japan. In 2012, the organization’s headquarters was seized to pay for the group’s
past due debts.175

It was then purchased by a monk named Ekan Ikeguchi, who let the Chongryon continue to use
the building in what he referred to as a “goodwill gesture”. Ikeguchi is one of the Chongryon‘s
many ties to organized crime. Ikeguchi was arrested in the past for an attempted coup against the
Japanese government. He also has ties to the political group Nihon Seinensya, which is involved in
illegal activities in conjunction with the yakuza syndicate Sumiyoshi-kai, which imports and sells
amphetamines made in North Korea.177 North Korea also has black market ties to Sumiyoshi-kai’s
rival syndicate, Yamaguchi-gumi. Many members of the Kodo-kai, Yamaguchi-gumi’s ruling
faction, are Korean-Japanese, with ties to North Korea.178 Masahiro Namikawa, leader of the drug
trafficking Seido-kai yakuza organization, also has ties to the Chongryon.179
The Chongryon operate at least two websites, chongryon.com, which is in Japanese, and koreanp.co.jp.
WHOIS records for chongryon.com indicate that it was registered by “guanin o” using the email
address park2@mac.com. The WHOIS information for korea-np.co.jp. shows that it was
registered by Choson Shinbo Company Inc. The WHOIS records for these sites can be found in
Appendix A.
Additionally, the Chongryon operate a ferry called the Mangyongbong-92, the only direct transit
from Japan to North Korea. In 2003, they were suspected of using the ferry to smuggle missile
parts.180 In 2006, the ferry was temporarily banned from Japanese waters when Japanese officials
discovered the Chongryon were using it to smuggle dual-use electronics to North Korea to be
used for military purposes.181
North Korea has a global network of state-run businesses located in 30 to 40
countries that is used for espionage activities. The Reconnaissance General Bureau
is responsible for oversight of this network.182 The businesses include cafes and
other non-suspect establishments. The highest concentration of these is in China.
Members of this espionage network reportedly “send more than $100 million in
cash per year to the regime and provide cover for spies.”183 These establishments
are also used for money laundering and drug trafficking.184

The regime is also known to kidnap foreign citizens and use them as instruments
for intelligence. Prisoners are first tortured and psychologically conditioned to bend to the
regime’s will. They are then used based on their skillset. This may include teaching their language
to North Koreans, spreading propaganda in their native language, providing translation services,

conducting military training, or other skills the regime deems useful.185 In July 2014, Japanese
officials agreed to lift some sanctions on North Korea when the regime agreed to investigate the
whereabouts of Japanese citizens who were allegedly abducted by North Korean agents decades
ago. Sanctions to be lifted include the ban on port calls to Japan by North Korean ships.186
North Korea has also infiltrated important positions in South Korea for both intelligence and
psychological operations purposes.187 In 2011, South Korea’s National Intelligence
Service reportedly discovered the presence of Communist spies. These spies within their trusted
circles had been reporting back to North Korea for almost 10 years. The embedded spies included
a Democratic Party representative. According to the agency, the spies were on a mission to
infiltrate and influence the Democratic Party and to gather military intelligence.188 The regime also
attempts to infiltrate organizations made up of North Koreans who seek shelter in South Korea, in
order to gain intelligence. In the past several years, South Korea has arrested at least 14 defectors
who were found to be spies.189
These intelligence collection and counterintelligence capabilities are an attempt to provide the
regime with a strategic asymmetrical advantage. The regime leverages its human and cyber
resources around the globe to provide an influx of intelligence, while very little credible
intelligence about the regime’s activities and capabilities ever becomes available to the outside
world.

Psychological operations
North Korea continues to be a master of propaganda and deception and leverages the cyber
realm for psychological operations. Modern North Korean psychological operations tactics include
distribution of propaganda via traditional media outlets, websites, and social media. Many of
these psychological operations campaigns are politically focused.190 According to Dr. Andrei
Lankov, the North Korean government has “very rational and highly successful manipulators who
usually get what they want by outsmarting everybody else in the process.”191

recruitment, cyber mobilization, and to instill fear in a target population. Cyber-psychological
operations may also include mental suggestion using technology as a delivery mechanism for
subliminal cues. It is unknown whether North Korea possesses this capability.192
North Korean citizens have access to state-approved social networks on the Kwangmyong.193

Figure 16 A photo posted by Jean Lee on Instagram shows one of the social networking sites on

The regime has a limited overt social media presence on the Internet. Some of the known social
media platforms employed by the regime include Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The YouTube
channel North Korea Today, operated by user rodrigorojo1, features news clips from North Korea.
It is unclear whether this channel is officially sanctioned.195 The North Korea Today YouTube
channel also has corresponding profiles on Twitter196 and Facebook.197

North Korean propaganda208 is used for several purposes: to enforce the ideals of allies
and sympathizers, to frame North Korea in a favorable light to outsiders, to
sensationalize the regime’s perceived self-reliance and military prowess, and to shield its
own citizens from the outside world.209 Juche ideology and indoctrination of the regime’s
youth ensure support of the local population. North Koreans accept military duty as an
honor and strive to excel in their service to the regime. In the spirit of juche, the regime

achieved.”210 Limiting citizen access to the outside world by instituting the Kwangmyong intranet,
North Korea ensures its citizens are not exposed to outside information that is counterproductive
to citizen indoctrination or in conflict with juche ideals. North Korea portrays the West, particularly
the United States, as an enemy. The regime uses this strategy of shifting the population’s
negative sentiments toward an external entity to keep its citizens ignorant of North Korea’s own
economic hardship, regime brutality, and systemic incompetence.211 For example, prior to Kim
Jong Il’s death in 2011, North Korean media altered photos of their “Dear Leader” to make him
appear younger and healthier than he really was. This became obvious when the altered photos
were compared to those taken by Western media around the same time. 212
According to Dr. Andrei Lankov, “North Koreans now have a much better understanding of what is
going on in the outside than they did before. This is largely thanks to the spread of DVDs and
video content in the country, but also because some of them have been to China and talk about
what they have seen…many [of] them sincerely believe that the United States remains ready to
attack at any moment and that Japan is an incurably aggressive place…nearly all of them swallow
the official propaganda myths about the Korean War being started by the 'American Imperialists'
who invaded them. Hence, they see the outside world as an inherently dangerous place.”213 Some
human rights groups seek to reach out to North Korean citizens and break them from this
isolation. In August 2014, the New York-based charity Human Rights Foundation sponsored a
hackathon in San Francisco called “Hack North Korea” to find new ways to get information in, out,
and around North Korea. The event brought together many programmers, human rights
campaigners, and defectors.214
North Korea even uses “trolling” as a PSYOP tactic. On the Internet, “trolls” are users who post
messages that are often crass, controversial, inflammatory, or offensive, in order to evoke a
strong reaction or influence a reader’s opinion. Often, the motivation for trolling is simply for the
troll’s enjoyment. The rude and offensive trolling tactics are in stark contrast to traditional forms
of persuasive rhetoric. However, North Korea reportedly utilizes over 200 military intelligence
operatives to troll South Korean message boards and social media pages with pro-North Korean
sentiments.215 Matt Rhoades, director of the cyberspace and security program at the Truman
National Security Project, said, "North Korea's cyber-development is almost just a new
harassment mechanism for them, a low-cost, asymmetric method to harass its neighbor in the
south…"216
Leveraging the cyber and intelligence resources noted above, North Korea’s psychological
operations serve an important strategic role. The ability to influence outsiders, while effectively
isolating its own population from most outside influence, allows North Korea to remain an
enigma. Additionally, in line with its PSYOP tactics, North Korea may strategically take credit for
cyber attacks that were, in reality, launched by another entity. Whether the targeted entity blames

North Korea for the attacks, or the regime simply takes credit for an attack that has not yet been
attributed, several PSYOP goals can come into play. First, to claim credit for an attack amplifies
the impact of a show of force, particularly if South Korea is the target. This tactic can be used to
stir sentiments in order to provoke a reaction. Second, North Korea may lay claim to responsibility
for an attack that exceeds its capabilities in order to seem more technologically advanced and
more capable. Third, any success, or the appearance thereof, enforces the juche ideal of regime
self-sufficiency. Finally, North Korea may act as a scapegoat and claim credit for a cyber attack of
an ally such as China so the attack is not attributed to the real actors.217

Electronic warfare
North Korea reportedly has the electronic warfare capabilities to jam GPS and to inject false GPS
coordinates.218 North Korea demonstrated these capabilities in March 2011 by jamming South
Korea’s GPS signals during a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise.219 North Korea has the
capability to create an EMP.220 An EMP is a sudden, extreme outburst of atmospheric electricity
creating an intense magnetic field that can burn out electrical equipment. 221 A report from the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) noted North Korea’s ability to deliver a nuclear
warhead as a satellite over the South Pole, effectively creating the burst needed to deliver an EMP
targeting the United States. An EMP could effectively disrupt electronic communications including
critical infrastructure components such as telecommunications, financial institutions, the energy
sector, transportation, food and water delivery, emergency services, and space systems. 222 North
Korea reportedly acquired its EMP technology from Russia.223
North Korea also has a drone program. The regime reportedly acquired its first drones in the late
1980’s or early 1990’s. The regime’s drones are complimentary to its intelligence program and
are primarily used for surveillance.224 In early 2014 a North Korean drone crashed south of the
38th parallel, the line dividing North Korea from the south.225 While early reports noted that the
drones appeared similar to those manufactured by Chinese company Tauyuan Navigation Friend
Aviation Technology, the company denied involvement.226

Stressing the importance of the regime’s electronic warfare capabilities, in 1999 former regime
leader Kim Jong Il said “The basic key to victory in modern warfare is to do well in electronic
warfare.”228 Since the regime’s advanced technology lags behind that of South Korea and the U.S.,
its capability to disrupt the communications of these perceived adversaries is a vital asymmetric
capability.229

Training cyber warriors
North Korea utilizes primary and secondary education and the university system to train its cyber
warfare operators. According to reports by defectors, the regime seeks out children who show
mathematical talent and sends them through rigorous advanced training.230 A vintage North
Korean animation stresses the importance of mathematics in North Korean education. The short
film follows a young boy as he does his geometry homework. The frustrated boy begins to
daydream then has visions of going to war with the U.S. and needing geometry to effectively
calculate missile trajectory during the battle.231

Science and technology students are expected to learn foreign languages, which may include
Chinese, Japanese, and English.233 Student emails, chats, and web browsing activities are heavily
monitored.234 Around age twelve or thirteen, chosen students are enrolled in accelerated
computer courses at First and Second Geumseong Senior-Middle Schools.

The successful students are then sent to Kim Il-sung University, Kim Chaek University of
Technology,236 or the Command Automation University, traditionally known as Mirim University.
Kim Il-sung University’s computer center was started in 1985. Its computer courses have a heavy
programming element. The university reportedly developed the Intelligent Locker hard disc
protection program, Worluf Antivirus, SIMNA (simulation and system analysis program), a war
games program, a hepatitis diagnosis and prescription system, and a C++ program development
tool called FC 2.0.237 Kim Il-sung University also has programs focusing on nuclear research.238
Kim Chaek University of Technology was established in 1948. In the late 1990s, it began to
restructure its computer-focused courses to reflect more modern technologies. As of 2002, the
university had three colleges focusing on computer science, information science and technology,
and machine science. Software developed by the university includes Computer Fax and SGVision,
an image-reprocessing program used for steganography.239 Students and instructors must
submit a formal request for permission in order to use the Internet for research.240

The Command Automation University periodically chooses around 100 students for an intensive
five-year course prior to their assignment to serve in cyber intelligence and cyber warfare
capacities.241 Programs at the Command Automation University include command automation,
computers, programming, automated reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.242 Other students
attend a two-year accelerated university program, then study abroad in Russia or China before
they are assigned to a cyber-operator role.243
The elite cyber operators are given special incentives. For example, parents of students
graduating from the cyber program with top scores are given the opportunity to live in
Pyongyang; and married cyber operators are given housing, a food allowance, and a stipend if
operating overseas. Due to the nature of their profession, these cyber elite are some of the only
North Koreans allowed to access the outside Internet.244

Important political and military ties
While this report focuses on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities, these capabilities cannot be
fully separated from the implications of partnerships with countries known to deal in illegal
weapons trade with the regime. Now that cyberspace has become a legitimate arena for warfare,
these nations are also potential allies in the cyber realm. For this reason, the regime’s key political
and military relationships are explored below.

China
North Korea has a longstanding historical relationship with China. During the Korean War (19501953), China allied with North Korea’s Communist forces. China has also provided ongoing
political and economic support to the regime’s leadership and is a primary trade partner. North
Korea is economically dependent on China. North Korea gets an estimated 90 percent of its
energy imports, 80 percent of its consumer goods, and 45 percent of its food supply from China.
This relationship is prudent – in the event of a military conflict, China can strategically use North
Korea as a buffer zone between itself and South Korea, where many U.S. military personnel are
stationed. Chinese aid to North Korea also deters the likelihood that the regime will collapse,
resulting in internal destabilization that could catalyze a U.S.-China conflict.245
North Korea relies heavily on China for technological resources. As noted above, North Korea
relies on China’s Unicom for Internet access.246 Additionally, the regime sends some of its cyber
warriors to train in China247 and stations a portion of its Unit 121 personnel in Shenyang.248 Some
of North Korea’s official websites are hosted in China, 249 and KCC has a branch office there.250

242

North Korea also relies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and
routers.251

Russia
North Korea has a long history of ties to Russia. The former Soviet Union was the major sponsor
of the North Korean state and a major trading partner. Following the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, aid to North Korea was halted and trade diminished significantly. This chain of events
contributed to North Korea’s eventual economic collapse, as it could not survive without aid.252
North Korea currently has a collaborative relationship with Russia in the cyber realm. The regime’s
CSTIA relies on Russia as one of several sources for technical data.253 North Korea also sends
some of its cyber warriors to train in Russia,254 and the regime reportedly acquired its EMP
technology from there.255
Political ties between Russia and North Korea have become stronger in recent months. In 2014,
potentially as a result of the U.S. response to the Russian-Ukranian conflict, Russia began to
strengthen ties with North Korea. Negotiations reportedly included promises of trade and
development projects. Narushige Michishita, a North Korea and Asia security expert at Japan's
National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, stated “By strengthening its relationship with North
Korea, Russia is trying to enhance its bargaining position vis-à-vis the United States and Japan.”256
Russia also recently forgave most of the regime’s debts.257

Iran
North Korea and Iran have longstanding political and military ties. North Korea supplied Iran with
conventional arms during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran and North Korea reportedly collaborate closely in
ballistic missile development efforts. In the past, Iran provided the North Korean regime with
necessary funds and oil in exchange for missile parts and technology. 258 259 In 2009, a North
Korean plane transporting 35 tons of weapons and allegedly bound for Iran was seized after
making an unscheduled stop in Bangkok, Thailand. That same year, United Arab Emirates seized a
ship bound for Iran that was transporting several containers of North Korean weapons, including
rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition. Reportedly, the customer was a company affiliated
with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 260 261
North Korea also has cyberwar ties with Iran. In 2012, North Korea and Iran signed a technology
treaty to help combat “common enemies” in cyberspace. The treaty included provisions for
cooperation in research, student exchanges, and joint laboratories. Joint projects reportedly

include IT information sharing, engineering, biotechnology, renewable energy, and sustainability.
F-Secure’s Mikko Hypponen stated, "It's highly likely that one of the reasons for this co-operation
is for them to work together regarding their cyber defence and cyber offense strategies".
Hypponen cited Flame malware as a possible triggering event for the creation of this treaty.
Others also suspect that Iran and North Korea’s mutual interest in development of nuclear
weapons and the need to protect refineries against malware such as Stuxnet were driving factors
in the establishment of the treaty.262 U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee leaders assert that the
treaty indicates North Korea and Iran are collaborating on a joint nuclear weapons program.263
Additionally, North Korea, in conjunction with Iran and Syria, reportedly supports both Hamas and
Hezbollah in procuring kinetic weaponry and communications equipment and in establishing
operational infrastructure.264 265 266

Syria
North Korea has both a cyber relationship and kinetic weapons ties with Syria. KCC reportedly has
a branch in Syria.267
In 2007, Israel launched an airstrike, destroying a Syrian target that was allegedly a nuclear facility
under construction with North Korea’s assistance. U.S. officials noted the facility was modeled on
the North Korean nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.268
The North Korea-Syria relationship becomes more important in the context of both countries’ ties
with Iran. As noted above, Iran, North Korea, and Syria jointly provide support to extremist groups
Hamas and Hezbollah.269 270 271 Additionally, as we explored in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11,
Iran and Syria’s military alliances extend to joint SIGINT and cyber operations.272

Cuba
North Korea also has an interesting relationship with Cuba – one that includes supplying weapons
and apparent attempts to illegally smuggle weapons. In 2013, a North Korean cargo ship on its
return voyage was stopped near the Panama Canal. The ship was carrying surface-to-air missile
parts, disguised as containers of sugar. In an attempt to save face, Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs stated that the cargo included "240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons -- two antiaircraft missile complexes Volga and Pechora, nine missiles in parts and spares, two Mig-21 Bis
and 15 motors for this type of airplane, all of it manufactured in the mid-20th century -- to be

repaired and returned to Cuba." Experts said the cargo appeared to include a SNR-75 Fan Song
fire-control radar system for an SA-2 missile, a Soviet-era missile system that was also used in
Cuba.273 Following the incident, Fidel Castro credited former North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung for
providing Cuba with weapons near the end of the Cold War. Weapons included 100,000 AK rifles
and necessary ammunition.274
While no apparent cyber relationship exists between North Korea and Cuba at this time, their track
record for weapons trade means the potential for future collaboration in the cyber realm cannot
be discounted.

Patterns in the noise: cyber incidents attributed to North Korean actors
It is interesting to note that much of North Korea’s cyber activity follows a distinct pattern.
Analysis of North Korean cyber activity gives insight into these patterns and also helps tie
together North Korea’s strategic, tactical, and operational capabilities. Strategic capabilities refer
to the assets used in support of a long-term, overarching goal. Tactical capabilities refer to the
methods and maneuvers actually implemented in pursuit of the strategic goal.304 Operational
capabilities refer to the potential use of these capabilities.305
In 2004, in response to the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises, North Korea
reportedly gained access to 33 South Korean military wireless communication networks.306 The
next significant cyber attack attributed to North Korea was in June 2006. The U.S. State
Department was attacked by entities in the East Asia-Pacific region. The attacks coincided with
State Department negotiations with North Korea regarding the regime’s nuclear missile tests. 307
In July 2006, North Korea’s Unit 121 reportedly breached South Korean and U.S. military
entities.308 This attack was concurrent with the regime’s test-fire of at least one long-range
missile and several medium-range missiles.309
2007 was politically tumultuous for North Korea. Following multi-national talks, the UN’s
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ordered the shutdown of the regime’s nuclear facilities
in Yongbyon in July.310 Its nuclear efforts temporarily thwarted, North Korea tested a logic bomb
in October 2007.311
In April 2009, North Korea ejected IAEA and U.S. nuclear compliance officials. The regime indicated
refusal to comply with any UN agreements regarding nuclear weaponry and announced it would
reinstate its nuclear materials production. The next month, North Korea conducted an
underground nuclear test and voiced its confidence that the regime was well on its way to
producing viable nuclear technology. The UN called an emergency meeting condemning the
nuclear weapons test, and South Korea joined the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). North
Korea issued a statement via KCNA calling South Korea’s involvement in PSI an act of war.312 In
June 2009, North Korea stated that it was “fully ready for any form of high-tech war.”313 The
following month, DDoS and disk wiping malware, later known as DarkSeoul, targeted South
Korean and U.S. government entities, media outlets, and financial websites. The attacks coincided

with U.S. Independence Day.314 315 Other malware used for Operation Troy was also planted.
Operation Troy would continue for several years, largely undetected.316
In early 2011, political and military tensions were high. In February, James Clapper, United States
Director of National Intelligence, testified that North Korea likely had undeclared uranium
enrichment facilities as part of its nuclear weapons program.317 In March 2011, South Korean
media, financial, and critical infrastructure targets suffered a DDoS and disk-wiping malware
attack later known as the “10 Days of Rain”. U.S. and South Korean military entities were also
targeted by DDoS during this attack. The attack used the DarkSeoul malware.318 North Korea also
disrupted South Korean GPS signals. Additionally, North Korean actors reportedly attempted a
DDoS attack against South Korea’s Incheon Airport that same month.319 These incidents coincided
with the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises.320 The following month, North Korean
actors reportedly launched a DDoS attack against South Korea’s Nonghyup bank.321
In 2012, an attack on South Korean Newspaper JoongAng Ilbo was attributed to North Korean
actors. This attack also coincided with the timing of the annual joint U.S. – South Korea military
exercises.322 In September 2012, North Korea signed a cyber treaty with Iran, agreeing the two
nations would collaborate to combat “common enemies” in cyberspace.323
The week of March 11, 2013, the U.S. and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise
near the Korean Peninsula. Like clockwork, attacks attributed to North Korea and now known as
the March 20 attacks targeted three South Korean media outlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju
banks. North Korea also exhibited other hostile activity at that time. North Korea cut
communication with Seoul and announced it had scrapped the 1953 armistice between the two
Koreas. North Korea’s foreign ministry also issued a statement that it perceived this exercise as a
precursor to invasion and that the regime would respond with a “strong military counteraction” if
the situation escalated.324 That same week, the North Korean military conducted a drone attack
simulation.325
On March 18, the Uriminzokkiri YouTube channel posted an anti-U.S. video entitled “Firestorms
Will Rain on the Headquarters of War” that showed a depiction of the White House in crosshairs,
followed by an explosion.326

Figure 25 Uriminzokkiri YouTube video portraying anti-U.S. sentiments. 327
In May 2013, DarkSeoul malware was used to attack several South Korean financial institutions;
and in June, DarkSeoul DDoS attacks were launched against the South Korean government’s DNS
server. The latter took place on June 25, the anniversary of the start of the Korean War.328
As evidenced above, much of North Korea’s cyber activity coincides with the annual U.S. – South
Korea joint military exercises. Attacks not following that pattern were typically in response to
political events impacting the regime or correlated with significant dates, such as the anniversary
of the start of the Korean War. The regime’s strategic assets and tactical capabilities in the cyber
arena seem to have evolved only slightly since 2009. Most of the attacks attributed to North
Korea employ limited tactics, and their operational capability demonstrates an increase in the
frequency and volume of attacks but is otherwise unimpressive to date.
In June 2014, the regime demanded cancellation of the annual U.S. - South Korea joint military
exercise, attempting to use participation in the upcoming Asian Games as a bargaining chip.329 The
regime’s demands may have had other political motivations, as they preceded the July 2014
meeting between South Korean president Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting

centered on trade and regional security issues, including the ever-present rhetoric around
denuclearization of North Korea.330 Both leaders were critical of Japan’s recent announcement to
soften sanctions on North Korea.331 As this report headed to press, the annual U.S. – South Korea
joint military exercises were underway.332

DarkSeoul
The most prominent North Korean threat actor group is the group responsible for the DarkSeoul
malware. According to statements from the South Korean government, North Korea’s Lab 110
were the actors behind the DarkSeoul malware. South Korean intelligence reports
According to statements

institutions.334
Some of the DarkSeoul attacks corresponded with significant dates, such as U.S. Independence
Day or the anniversary of the start of the Korean War. DarkSeoul attacks go beyond denial of
service and sabotage. As early as 2009, the group responsible for the Dark Seoul attacks
launched “Operation Troy”, an espionage campaign targeting the South Korean military. The
operation was codenamed “Troy” due to the frequent use of the word “Troy” in the malware’s
compile path strings.335 The malware used in these attacks sought out and exfiltrated data, based
on keyword searches. While the malware was clearly intended to search for and exfiltrate certain
types of data, its true impact on the targets was never revealed. 336 The March 2011 “10 Days of
Rain” DDoS attacks on U.S. and South Korean sites have also been attributed to the actors
associated with DarkSeoul.337 According to Symantec, the politically motivated attacks have
required a level of intelligence, coordination, monetary support, and technical sophistication that
suggests state sponsorship.338 This designation means the group can be considered an advanced
persistent threat (APT).
A March 20, 2013 attack attributed to the DarkSeoul actors targeted three South Korean media
outlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju banks. The impact of the March 20 attacks included
disruption of service at financial institutions and data deletion. However, the targeted entities
resumed normal operations shortly thereafter.339 According to South Korean reports, the media
outlets targeted corresponded with those listed by the North Korean regime in 2012 as right-wing
press that manipulated South Korea’s public opinion. In April 2012, the regime reportedly listed

those entities as attack targets.340 The malware used in the March 20, 2013 attacks were wiper
malware. The malware attempted to disable AhnLab and Hauri AV antivirus products then
proceeded to overwrite the master boot record (MBR). The attack was capable of wiping both
Linux and Windows machines.341 McAfee found that these attacks were the culmination of the
malware campaign they dubbed “Operation Troy”.342
A report from IssueMakersLab tied the actors responsible for the March 20, 2013 attacks to cyber
attack activity occurring as early as 2007. IssueMakersLab found that these actors consistently
used the same 16-digit password for file compression, the same stage 1 C2 protocol, the same
collection keywords and encryption keys, and the same development path.343 According to South
Korea’s Korea Internet and Security Agency, the North Korean IP address 175.45.178.xx was
found scanning South Korean routes the month before the attacks,344 and the same IP was
reportedly logged as accessing one of the targets 13 times.345 Details of the March 20 attack also
suggested possible ties to China. AlienVault suspected the Chinese exploit kit GonDad was used to
spread the malware, and the Korean domains serving the malware were registered using a
Chinese email address. Additionally, researchers at AhnLab in South Korea noted a Chinese IP
address linked to the attacks.346
While no concrete evidence has been released that indicates Lab 110 was responsible for the
DarkSeoul attacks, the responsible group’s targets, TTP, and attack timing demonstrate a strong
pro-North Korean sentiment.

Based on North Korea’s affinity for disinformation and counterintelligence, we must note the
distinct possibility that operatives claiming to be WhoIs Team are part of another group and that
the defacement was a false flag operation meant to pin blame on RAON_ASRT. RAON_ASRT is a
South Korean white hat capture the flag (CTF) team, whose members also operate under the
name “WhoIs”.357

RAON_ASRT WhoIs Team would maliciously target South Korean entities.

IsOne
IsOne is the group that claimed responsibility for the June 2012 attack on the website of South
Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. The attack included an attempt to wipe JoongAng Ilbo’s servers
as well as a defacement depicting a laughing cat. Despite efforts to wipe the target’s servers, the
target only suffered defacement and temporary downtime.365

Although the groups have a similar name and both use a cat theme, it is unclear whether a CTF
team known as “The Cat is Number 1” and IsOne are the same actors. “The Cat is Number 1”
members claim to hail from North Korea, but there is no hard evidence linking team members to

another group.

Figure 29 A screenshot of “The Cat is Number One” profile on CTF Time 368
According to South Korea’s National Police Agency, the attack on JoongAng Ilbo shares
characteristics with previous attacks attributed to North Korean actors. An investigation
conducted by the agency’s Cyber Terror Response Center found that the actors targeting
JoongAng Ilbo used two North Korean servers and 17 servers in 10 other countries. One server
maintained a constant connection to an IP address belonging to Joson Telecommunication
Company, which is affiliated with North Korea’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
Investigators found that one of the servers used in the attack on JoongAng Ilbo was also used in
the March 2011 DDoS attacks on South Korean critical infrastructure sites and the April 2011
attack on Nyongyup Bank.369

an individual actor within the group.
It is interesting to note that the malware associated with these actors uses the strings “HASTATI”
and “PRINCIPES” to overwrite the MBR. The name Hastati likely refers to a class of infantrymen of
the early Roman Republic. The Hastati were less experienced soldiers who fought on the
frontlines with spears and swords. Principes likely refers to more experienced Roman soldiers
who fought on the second line of battle. 375

Malware summary
HP researchers had previously analyzed samples of the DarkSeoul dropper, and findings were
published in our annual HP Cyber Risk Report 2013. Analysis of this malware is included in
Appendix C. Analysis of additional malware used in these campaigns produced no new findings
and only corroborated what was found by external security researchers. These publicly available
analyses have been cited throughout the report. Some of the malware samples were no longer
publicly available. However, CrowdStrike obtained these missing samples before they
disappeared from the wild and conducted thorough analysis, which was released in their
subscription-only reports. While we cannot divulge detailed information from those reports, an
overview of the findings is provided below.

The majority of the malware used in cyber incidents attributed to North Korea were variations of
three types of malware: dropper, wiper, and IRC remote access trojan (RAT). CrowdStrike’s
attribution of this malware to North Korean actors stemmed from two primary factors: Korean
language characters found in the binaries and the propensity to specifically target South Korean
entities.379
Dropper samples consistently targeted AhnLab Policy Center as a propagation method. This
information is corroborated in a Black Hat Asia 2014 presentation by Fortinet researcher Kyle
Yang.380 CrowdStrike’s report also briefly noted the use of an update server vector.381 Yang
analyzed the malware's update config metadata and matched its format to the AhnLab Policy
Center. To test its payload, Yang set up a server/client and executed the update through the
server. As Yang had predicted, it wiped the client.382 While the method for initial compromise of
the update server is not noted in detail, CrowdStrike’s report cites “collateral information” that
suggests targeted email attacks were used to gain initial entry, and policy servers were then
compromised. The upload server vector included a time-based logic bomb that allowed the wiper
to target a large number of systems, on a set time and date, with full permissions on all of the
targeted systems.383
According to CrowdStrike, the wiper malware was dropped on the systems as AgentBase.exe. The
wiper used the Windows utility 'taskkill' to kill the processes pasvc.exe and clisvc.exe, which are
the main processes for the Ahnlab and Hauri antivirus applications.384 385 The wiper then
performed system reconnaissance, gathering drive information and operating system version.
Depending on the OS used, the wiper recursively deleted files on the file system, deleting the
Windows folder last. It then overwrote the MBR with the strings "HASTATI", "PRINCPES",
"PRINCIPES", or "PR!NCPES”.386
While there are several variants of the wiper, all seem to have been used on the same date. It is
unclear why multiple wiper variants with slightly differing behavior were used for the same
campaign. One possible explanation is that multiple variants were used to minimize the
operational damage to the mission in the case of an early detection of one of the variants. For
example, if one wiper variant was compromised or detected by antivirus or IDS signatures, the
other variants may have differed enough to remain undetected, still resulting in mission success.
According to CrowdStrike, a third malware component downloaded an IRC RAT from various
compromised websites. This RAT is detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Prioxer. Prioxer has been
linked to other 2011 attacks on South Korea. It is unclear whether these downloaders were

Analysis
Based on the information above, we have identified strategic challenges that impact the
development of North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities. We have also noted relevant
implications:
•

•

•

•

•

•

387

The North Korean regime strictly controls all Internet infrastructure,388 meaning cyber
activity by dissidents or autonomous hacker groups are very unlikely. In other words, any
cyber attacks originating in North Korea can be assumed to be state sponsored. For this
reason, according to defectors, the regime’s cyber operators do not typically launch
attacks directly from within North Korea. Instead, many regime-sponsored attacks are
launched from cells based in China, U.S., South Asia, Europe, and even South Korea.389
North Korea has a limited number of outgoing connections.390 For this reason, there is a
low probability of DDoS originating from within. However, this does not preclude the use
of botnets with a local C2 server or the use of networks in third-party nations to launch
attacks. As seen in the July 2009 attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets, North Korea
has leveraged networks in countries such as Austria, Georgia, Germany, and even South
Korea and the U.S., in order to launch cyber attacks.391 North Korea will likely be forced to
rely on third parties for quite some time, due to its lack of sufficient infrastructure for
launching large-scale CNO.
Several outward facing websites are hosted in China and other countries. This implies two
possibilities: that North Korea’s infrastructure cannot handle a heavy incoming traffic load
392
or that the regime wants to separate the propaganda crafted for an outside target
audience from internally-focused propaganda. This arrangement seems unlikely to
change in the foreseeable future.
North Korea is known to have unstable power supplies393, which limits scalability of the
regime’s current CNO capabilities. This is another reason why expansion of CNO
capabilities using the nation’s own infrastructure seems unlikely in the foreseeable future.
North Korea is known to have monetary deficiencies,394 which further limit expansion of
infrastructure and CNO capabilities, at least without third-party aid. North Korea continues
to rely heavily on China for sustainment.395
Although we see few instances of overt cyber operations, that North Korea reportedly
spends so much of its limited resources on training and equipping cyber operators speaks
volumes. The human element of the regime’s cyber war program, at least, has potential.

Sanctions against North Korea and export laws prohibit the sale of certain technologies to
the regime.396 In other words, in order to obtain the technology needed for a cyber
warfare program, the regime must improvise. North Korea must develop its own
technology, manufacture technology using plans obtained via industrial espionage, or rely
on third parties to procure it for them. However, the regime has historically failed in its
attempts of large-scale production of electronic components. At present, North Korea
relies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and routers.397
It is unlikely that North Korea will compromise on its nuclear program, meaning sanctions
will likely be longstanding, and the regime will have to continue to rely on third parties to
procure technology.

Cyber incidents attributed to North Korean actors seem to follow distinct patterns:










According to reports by other researchers, the conventions and C2 structure used by
North Korean cyber actors show continuity and consistency over time.
The majority of the incidents attributed to North Korean actors consistently used wiper
malware.
Several of the incidents included defacements, with a different group taking credit each
time. Additionally, little information or attack history was found about any of the groups,
aside from information acknowledged in this report. These factors seem to indicate that a
single group may have been responsible for several attacks over time, using different
group names as a false flag.
On more than one occasion, the malware included provisions to disable security software
made by South Korean security company AhnLab. This detail strengthens the case that
the malware was written or modified to specifically target South Korean machines.
The attacks followed an explicit pattern: most were around the time of U.S. – South
Korean joint military exercises, while the others fell on a significant date or were in
response to political events.
The primary targets were South Korean and U.S. entities. While these nations are
traditionally targeted by the regime, it is also possible that South Korean entities are quick
to attribute any attack on their infrastructure to North Korean actors. In fact, in some
cases, South Korean reports were the only source of attribution.

Summary
Does North Korea have sufficient cyber infrastructure and cyber warfare capabilities to harm the
U.S. and its allies? While North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities pale in comparison to those of
wealthier nations, the regime has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure and in
establishing cyber operations. The rate of this progress warrants a closer look at North Korea’s
motivations, TTPs, and capabilities. As noted above, North Korea views the U.S. and South Korea
as its primary adversaries. The U.S. and South Korea are high-tech nations with economies that

depend heavily on technology.398 In contrast, North Korea does not have a high tech culture. For
these reasons, we should not overestimate the regime’s advanced cyber capability, yet we should
never underestimate the potential impact of North Korea utilizing less advanced, quick-and-dirty
tactics like DDoS to cripple their high-tech targets. Both government and corporate entities are
susceptible to being targeted by North Korean cyber attacks. North Korean juche ideology places
the survival of the regime as its primary goal, and any perceived threat to the regime may be
targeted. Several attacks on U.S. and South Korean government, financial, and critical
infrastructure entities have been attributed to North Korean origins.. These attacks were often
preceded by or occurred in conjunction with North Korea voicing negative sentiments about the
targeted entities. As we saw with Iranian cyber actors in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11,399
state sponsored cyber actors often launch an attack in response to a political trigger. The same
pattern seems to apply to pro-North Korean cyber actors, who have launched attacks to coincide
with U.S. Independence Day and the anniversary of the start of the Korean War, as well as
propaganda and cyber attacks in response to joint military exercises between the U.S. and South
Korea.400 401
As shown by North Korea's past behavior (which is consistent with their doctrine), they are easily
"pushed into a corner". At the slightest perceived threat, the regime responds with saber-rattling
and peacocking. The regime is extremely defensive and will, in turn, flex its muscles to show the
world how capable it is, even if this is an inaccurate display of their overall capabilities.
The regime fears losing its control and the nation’s culture to the ever-growing threat of outside
influence, as is evidenced in the regime’s reaction to the comedy film “The Interview”. The regime
has represented itself to its citizens as a powerful and capable entity and has used this status to
control the populace. For this reason, the regime’s leaders are forced to continually demonstrate
this strength and power, or an illusion thereof, both domestically and globally, in order to
maintain the status needed to ensure continued suppression of the population. This show of
power may require that the regime takes chances and stretches beyond its abilities at times, but
in the spirit of juche and songun, the regime will continue this façade, fearful of losing the image
its leaders have worked so hard to maintain.

HP Security Research recommendations
North Korean cyber operations are not generally observed originating from home field IP address
space, so geo-IP based blocking of traffic originating from those net-blocks is ineffective.

Given that North Korea has capable and technically trained forces and will demonstrate their
power when they feel provoked, western entities should consciously avoid promoting ideas or
doctrine that is blatantly slanderous to the regime. Encouraging such ideas could cause those
entities to become a focal point for North Korean cyber attacks.
Due to the fact that North Korean infrastructure is aging and its resources are not able to keep up
with the rest of the world, entities with interesting R&D or IP (intellectual property) - especially
military in nature – could become targets of interest for North Korea. Interest in defense-related
IP and R&D could also stem from North Korea’s relationship with China. In the Chinese business
culture, taking another entity’s IP or R&D is not stealing – it is accepted as business as usual. It is
possible that North Korea, if under Chinese influence, would adopt the same attitude, given the
regime’s limited capacity for homegrown innovation.
Known DPRK targets have been limited primarily to South Korean and U.S. organizations and
government entities. For these targets, prudent measures should include:




Following traditional defense in depth approaches and security best practices
Monitoring for malware that disables Korean language antivirus software, such as
that from AhnLab
To protect against the attack vectors used in North Korean malware campaigns,
an advisable prevention tactic is to focus on hardening update/patch
management systems. These systems are appealing targets due to the potential
for a large impact

Appendix C – Analysis of DarkSeoul Dropper
Dropper
MD5: 9263e40d9823aecf9388b64de34eae54
Also known as/detected as :
 Dropper-FDH (McAfee)
 Trojan:Win32/Dembr.A (Microsoft)
 Trojan.Jokra (Symantec)
The dropper component that we examined was distributed as a UPX-packed binary.
Installation
When executed it creates the following files in the affected user’s %Temp% directory:
•

•

•

•

alg.exe: A legitimate binary used to open SSH connections with remote servers
MD5 e45cd9052dd3dd502685dfd9aa2575ca
Size: 166,912 bytes
conime.exe: A legitimate binary used to open SSH connections with remote servers
MD5: 6a702342e8d9911bde134129542a045b
Size: 153,600 bytes
~pr1.tmp: Payload - A destructive bash script
MD5: dc789dee20087c5e1552804492b042cd
Size: 1,186 bytes
Also known as/detected as:
KillMBR-FBIA (McAfee)
Trojan:SH/Kofornix.A (Microsoft)
Trojan.Jokra (Symantec)
AgentBase.exe: Payload - Win32 wiper component (see details below)
MD5: db4bbdc36a78a8807ad9b15a562515c4
Size: 24,576

Payload—attempts to connect to remote servers and upload a destructive bash script
After determining the location of user profile directories on the affected computer, the malware
searches these directories for configuration files and directories that may be associated with the
connection manager clients mRemote and SecureCRT.
• mRemote—an open source tool for centrally managing remote server connections using a GUI
(Kevin Kline, 2008).69 This tool is no longer being actively developed or supported.
• SecureCRT—a commercial SSH and Telnet client by VanDyke Software.
If an mRemote installation is located, the dropper reads the configuration file and checks if there’s
a NODE that is defined with “Username=root”, “Protocol=SSH”, and a password that is not blank. If

those conditions are satisfied it extracts the information. The password is decrypted after being
extracted.
If a SecureCRT installation is located, the dropper extracts information from sessions that have
Username=root, Protocol=SSH and a saved password. If these conditions are satisfied, the
username, hostname, port, and password are extracted. The password is then decrypted.
After extracting these connection and server details, the dropper uses the previously dropped alg.
exe and conime.exe to attempt to connect remote servers, upload and run the bash script
~pr1.tmp.
The bash script initially checks which UNIX it is running on (of HP-UX, SunOS, Linux, or AIX) and
then attempts to wipe the /kernel, /usr /etc and /home directories, thus rendering the machine
inoperative.
Win32 Wiper component
When the AgentBase.exe component is executed, it first attempts to stop the following processes,
presumably in order to evade detection:
• pasvc.exe – policy agent from AhnLab
• clisvc.exe – ViRobot ISMS from Hauri
It then enumerates all physical drives and overwrites the first 512 bytes with the string:
“princpes”, effectively destroying the MBR (master boot record) of the affected drive.
It continues to look for removable and fixed drives, locates the root directory on these drives, and
then attempts to delete all files and folders in this directory.
Finally, the affected computer is shut down and rebooted, although if the wiping mechanisms
were successful then the machine will not be able to boot.
