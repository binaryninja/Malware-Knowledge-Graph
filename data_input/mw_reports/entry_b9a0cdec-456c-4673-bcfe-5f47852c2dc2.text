The success of enterprise ransomware attacks has motivated more and more threat actors
to join the game.
One of these new players is ProLock ransomware.

1/7

The locker emerged in March 2020 as the successor of PwndLocker, which began operating
in late 2019 and was responsible for the attack on Illinois' Lasalle County earlier this year.
Their ransoms were always in the six-figure range, and it seems that ProLock operators are
continuing that trend.
Despite not being around long, ProLock has already made its mark, targeting financial,
healthcare, government, and retail organizations. The group's first big attack – that we know
of, at least – happened at the end of April, when they successfully attacked Diebold Nixdorf one of the major ATM providers.
In this post I'll tell you all you need to know about the new player's main tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs). After, I give a complete outline of the MITRE ATT&CK mapping as it
pertains to ProLock.
Initial Access
ProLock operators used two main vectors of initial access: QakBot (Qbot) and unprotected
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)-servers with weak credentials.
The latter is a fairly common technique among ransomware operators. This kind of access is
usually bought from a third party but may be obtained by group members as well.
The more interesting initial access vector is QakBot, a trojan that was at one point affiliated
with the MegaCortex ransomware family.
Typically, QakBot is distributed via phishing campaigns. Phishing emails may contain
attachments of weaponized Microsoft Office documents or just links to such documents that
are located on cloud storage – Microsoft OneDrive, for example.
QakBot is also known to be loaded by Emotet, a trojan notorious for its connection with Ryuk
operators.
Execution
Once weaponized document is downloaded and opened by the victim, malicious macros is
enabled, PowerShell is launched and used to download and run QakBot payload from the C2
server.
It's important to note here that the same can be said about ProLock: the payload is extracted
from a BMP or JPG file, and is loaded into memory with PowerShell. In some cases, a
scheduled task is used to run PowerShell:
schtasks.exe /CREATE /XML C:\Programdata\WinMgr.xml /tn WinMgr
schtasks.exe /RUN /tn WinMgr
del C:\Programdata\WinMgr.xml
del C:\Programdata\run.bat

Persistence
In case of RDP access, valid accounts are used to gain persistence in the network. QakBot,
on the other hand, uses multiple persistence mechanisms – most often Run keys and
scheduled tasks:

In some cases, startup folders are also used: a shortcut is placed in the folder that points to
the loader.
Defense Evasion
QBot has a neat trick that lets it avoid detection: it checks for the newest version of itself, and
replaces the current version with the new one. Executable files are signed with a stolen or
fake signature. The initial payload, downloaded by PowerShell, is stored on the server with a
PNG extension. What's more, is that it's replaced with the legitimate file calc.exe after
execution.
To evade detection, QakBot also uses explorer.exe to execute a process injection
technique.
As already mentioned, the ProLock payload is hidden inside a BMP or JPG file and may be
considered a defense evasion technique as well.
Credential Access
QakBot has keylogging capabilities but is also able to download and run additional scripts
like Invoke-Mimikatz, a PowerShell version of the notorious Mimikatz. This enables the
adversary to employ the credential dumping technique.
Discovery
Once privileged credentials are obtained, ProLock operators start network discovery
activities. They include, but are not limited to, port scanning and Active Directory
reconnaissance.
In addition to a wide variety of scripts, attackers use AdFind – another popular tool used by
many ransomware groups – to query Active Directory.
Lateral Movement

3/7

Many adversaries favor RDP to move laterally across networks, and ProLock is no
exception. Attackers even have batch scripts in their arsenals to enable RDP access on the
target hosts:
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v
"fDenyTSConnections" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Desktop" new enable=yes
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"
/v "UserAuthentication" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

Figure 3: A batch script for enabling RDP
For remote script execution, ProLock operators use PsExec from Sysinternals Suite, another
common tool.
To run ProLock on hosts, attackers used WMIC – a command line interface for Windows
Management Instrumentation – which is also becoming increasingly popular among
ransomware operators.
Collection
Just like many other groups, ProLock operators collect data from compromised networks to
improve their chances of fulfilling their ransom demands. Prior to exfiltration, collected data is
archived with 7Zip.
Exfiltration
For exfiltration, ProLock operators use Rclone, a command line tool capable of synching
files to and from different cloud storage providers, such as OneDrive, Google Drive, Mega,
etc. The executable is always renamed to resemble legitimate system binaries.
Unlike their peers, though, ProLock operators still don't have a website where they publish
exfiltrated data from companies that refuse to pay the ransom.
Impact
Once the data is exfiltrated, the group deploys ProLock enterprise-wide. PowerShell is used
to extract the binary from a PNG or a JPG file and inject it into the memory:

First, ProLock kills processes from embedded list (what's interesting is that it uses only six
letters from the process name, like "winwor") and stops services, including security-related
ones like CSFalconService (CrowdStrike Falcon), via the net stop command.
Then, like many other ransomware families, it uses vssadmin to remove Volume Shadow
Copies and limit their size, so no new copies are created:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: /maxsize=401MB
vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: /maxsize=unbounded

Figure 5: Removing Volume Shadow Copies
ProLock adds .proLock, .pr0Lock or .proL0ck extension to each encrypted file, and drops
[HOW TO RECOVER FILES].TXT to each folder – a file with instructions on how to decrypt
files, including the link to the website, where the victim should enter the unique ID and get
payment information:

Each ProLock sample has an embedded ransom amount – in this case it was 35 Bitcoin, or
approximately $312 000.
Summary
As you can see, ProLock uses many similar techniques as other ransomware operators to
achieve their goals. At the same time, however, the group does have its own unique
approach. With more and more cybercrime groups showing interest in enterprise
ransomware deployment campaigns, some operators may be involved in deploying different
ransomware families, so we'll likely see more overlaps in tactics, techniques and procedures.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
The global pandemic has forced many people to work from home. Transitioning employees
to remote work creates additional cybersecurity risks. Many cybercriminals are exploiting the
crisis and ransomeware operators are not an exception. INTERPOL's Cybercrime team
