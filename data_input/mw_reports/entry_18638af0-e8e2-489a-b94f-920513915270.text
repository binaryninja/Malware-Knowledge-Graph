Karakurt Data Extortion Group
SUMMARY
Actions to take today to mitigate cyber
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the
threats from ransomware:
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury),
• Prioritize patching known
and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
exploited vulnerabilities.
(FinCEN) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity
• Train users to recognize and
Advisory (CSA) to provide information on the
report phishing attempts.
Karakurt data extortion group, also known as the
Karakurt Team and Karakurt Lair. Karakurt actors
• Enforce multifactor authentication.
have employed a variety of tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges
for defense and mitigation. Karakurt victims have not reported encryption of compromised machines
or files; rather, Karakurt actors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it
to the public unless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. Known ransom demands have
ranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire within a
week of first contact with the victim.
Karakurt actors have typically provided screenshots or copies of stolen file directories as proof of
stolen data. Karakurt actors have contacted victims’ employees, business partners, and clients
[T1591.002] with harassing emails and phone calls to pressure the victims to cooperate. The emails
have contained examples of stolen data, such as social security numbers, payment accounts, private
company emails, and sensitive business data belonging to employees or clients. Upon payment of
ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a
brief statement explaining how the initial intrusion occurred.

To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact
your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field,When available, please include the following
information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people
affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a
designated point of contact. To report incidents and anomalous activity or to request incident response
resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov.

Prior to January 5, 2022, Karakurt operated a leaks and auction website found at
https://karakurt[.]group. The domain and IP address originally hosting the website went offline in the
spring 2022. The website is no longer accessible on the open internet, but has been reported to be
located elsewhere in the deep web and on the dark web. As of May 2022, the website contained
several terabytes of data purported to belong to victims across North America and Europe, along with
several “press releases” naming victims who had not paid or cooperated, and instructions for
participating in victim data “auctions.”

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Initial Intrusion
Karakurt does not appear to target any specific sectors, industries, or types of victims. During
reconnaissance [TA0043], Karakurt actors appear to obtain access to victim devices primarily:
•
•
•

By purchasing stolen login credentials [T1589.001] [T1589.002];
Via cooperating partners in the cybercrime community, who provide Karakurt access to
already compromised victims; or
Through buying access to already compromised victims via third-party intrusion broker
networks [T1589.001].
o Note: Intrusion brokers, or intrusion broker networks, are malicious individual cyber
actors or groups of actors who use a variety of tools and skills to obtain initial access
to—and often create marketable persistence within—protected computer systems.
Intrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised computer systems to other
cybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in ransomware, business email
compromise, corporate and government espionage, etc.

Common intrusion vulnerabilities exploited for initial access [TA001] in Karakurt events include the
following:
• Outdated SonicWall SSL VPN appliances [T1133] are vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs
• Log4j “Log4Shell” Apache Logging Services vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) [T1190]
• Phishing and spearphishing [T1566]
• Malicious macros within email attachments [T1566.001]
• Stolen virtual private network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078]
• Outdated Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances [T1133]/firewall appliances [T1190] are
vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs
• Outdated and/or unserviceable Microsoft Windows Server instances

Network Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Persistence, and Exfiltration
Upon developing or obtaining access to a compromised system, Karakurt actors deploy Cobalt Strike
beacons to enumerate a network [T1083], install Mimikatz to pull plain-text credentials [T1078], use
AnyDesk to obtain persistent remote control [T1219], and utilize additional situation-dependent tools
to elevate privileges and move laterally within a network.

Karakurt actors then compress (typically with 7zip) and exfiltrate large sums of data—and, in many
cases, entire network-connected shared drives in volumes exceeding 1 terabyte (TB)—using open
source applications and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services [T1048], such as Filezilla, and cloud
storage services including rclone and Mega.nz [T1567.002].

Extortion
Following the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by way of
“readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email networks, and
emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. The ransom notes reveal the victim
has been hacked by the “Karakurt Team” and threaten public release or auction of the stolen data.
The instructions include a link to a TOR URL with an access code. Visiting the URL and inputting the
access code open a chat application over which victims can negotiate with Karakurt actors to have
their data deleted.
Karakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which
employees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning the
recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the dissemination of victim
data. These communications often included samples of stolen data—primarily personally identifiable
information (PII), such as employment records, health records, and financial business records.
Victims who negotiate with Karakurt actors receive a “proof of life,” such as screenshots showing file
trees of allegedly stolen data or, in some cases, actual copies of stolen files. Upon reaching an
agreement on the price of the stolen data with the victims, Karakurt actors provided a Bitcoin
address—usually a new, previously unused address—to which ransom payments could be made.
Upon receiving the ransom, Karakurt actors provide some form of alleged proof of deletion of the
stolen files, such as a screen recording of the files being deleted, a deletion log, or credentials for a
victim to log into a storage server and delete the files themselves.
Although Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep the
incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the confidentiality of
victim information after a ransom was paid. Note: The U.S. government strongly discourage the
payment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber criminals promising to delete stolen
files in exchange for payments.
In some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked by other
ransomware variants. In such cases, Karakurt actors likely purchased or otherwise obtained
previously stolen data. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time these victims were
under attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received ransom notes from multiple
ransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors purchased access to a
compromised system that was also sold to another ransomware actor.
Karakurt actors have also exaggerated the degree to which a victim had been compromised and the
value of data stolen. For example, in some instances, Karakurt actors claimed to steal volumes of
data far beyond the storage capacity of compromised systems or claimed to steal data that did not
belong to the victim.

Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,
storage device, the cloud).
Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited
interruption to the organization.
Regularly back up data and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of critical
data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides.
Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts and enable real time detection.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches
are released.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized accounts.

Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least
privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.
Disable unused ports.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Enforce multi-factor authentication.
Use National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for developing and
managing password policies.
o Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64
characters in length;
o Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;
o Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;
o Avoid reusing passwords;
o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;
o Disable password “hints”;
o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular
and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in
users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.
o Require administrator credentials to install software.
Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and
using a VPN.
Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on
information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks
and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).
