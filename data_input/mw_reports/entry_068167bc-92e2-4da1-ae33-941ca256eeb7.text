Business email compromise (BEC) is becoming a more sophisticated cyber threat because
of the availability of sensitive corporate data on the dark web. This is problematic, as BEC
and its derivates, such as vendor email compromise (VEC) and invoice fraud, are the
largest categories of malicious activity in terms of monetary losses. In 2021, victims lost an
estimated $2.4 billion to BEC scams, totaling more than a third of all cybercrime losses
($6.9 billion) and causing more losses than ransomware attacks, according to FBI
estimates.
The widespread use of ransomware with the use of data disclosures (together sometimes
known as double extortion) has made sensitive corporate data highly available on the
criminal underground, with such data available for free or a fee to any threat actor. The data

is a rich source of information for criminals who can easily weaponize it for secondary BEC
attacks. This is especially relevant, as markets like Genesis and underground services
available in multiple high-end forums allow malicious users to purchase credentials for as
little as $10 that provide access to genuine corporate email accounts. This helps attackers
launch a BEC attack from an internal, genuine email address as opposed to a spoofed
address an attacker would otherwise use. Such use of genuine email addresses makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses and consumers to distinguish malicious activity from
genuine business operations.
Data disclosures
The Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) team analyzed data from ransomware leak
sites and compared its own research with that of external entities. ACTI examined the top
20 most active dedicated leak sites, or dark web name-and-shame sites, measured by
number of featured victims, between July 2021 and July 2022 (Exhibit 1). Within this period,
ACTI observed an estimated 4,026 victims (corporate, non-governmental organizations and
governmental entities) on various ransomware groups’ dedicated leak sites.

An estimated 91% of the 4,026 victims on dedicated leak sites incurred subsequent data
disclosures of various degrees, with the remaining victims not having experienced an
observed data leak. The notion that nearly all ransomware collectives, regardless of size,
engage in double-extortion techniques indicates that malicious actors disclose very large
amounts of data, making that data available to anyone.
ACTI has found that dedicated leak sites most commonly provide financial data, followed by
employee and client personally identifiable information, and communication documentation.
These findings echo the observations of other researchers. ACTI also found that whenever
an exfiltrated batch of data includes at least one of the above categories, the group that
exfiltrated it consistently highlights the data type on its dedicated leak site. This boasting
showcases the perceived high value of such data and the propensity for the disclosure of
such data. The highlighted section of Exhibit 2 provides an example of such promotion from
RedAlert’s dedicated leak site.

Data indexing improves malicious usability
The emergence of vast quantities of leaked data enhances a BEC actor's ability to target an
organization by strengthening the BEC attack chain while also undermining traditional
defenses. ACTI assesses that the utility of dedicated leak site data has historically been
limited by the difficulty of interacting with large quantities of poorly stored data. This has
been cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly for actors, thereby creating a natural barrier
for widespread abuse of the data, until now. ACTI found that several groups are making

their dedicated leak site data more accessible by moving away from Tor domains and
toward publicly accessible sites. Moreover, sites like ALPHV and Industrial Spy offer
searchable indexed data, including sensitive data such as employee personally identifiable
information and financial data like that outlined in red in Exhibit 3. Because it facilitates and
speeds access, this searchability is enormously beneficial to malicious actors seeking to
weaponize data for secondary attacks.
Industrial Spy emerged as a data-selling marketplace in April 2022. It discloses some data
freely and sells individual files for as little as one dollar. The operators actively organize and
name folders with labels that reflect their content to make finding specific files easy. Folder
4 of Exhibit 3 (highlighted to showcase data indexing and obfuscated to protect potential
victims) is an example of this.

Moreover, the Industrial Spy marketplace now operates a working search function. ACTI
tests found that threat actors can search for specific files such as employee data, invoices,
scans, contracts, legal documents, email messages, and more. This search function also
enables actors to hunt for data from specific industries and countries, for example, USbased engineering or insurance organizations.

Similarly, the ALPHV ransomware group has created an indexed and searchable database
of its leaks (Exhibit 4, again obfuscated to protect potential victims), allowing anyone to
search the ALPHV database for terms including employee names, contract data, invoices,
leadership, and more. This facilitates locating data necessary to enrich a social engineering
ploy. ACTI found "about 10,000" results when searching for "invoice" across indexed
disclosures, as well as 6,000 results for "CFO," 10,000 for "accounting," and 10,000 for
"email," showcasing the large amount of information available.

ACTI assesses that the indexed and searchable databases like these help actors more
efficiently acquire specific data versus downloading bulk data and hoping to find desired
information.
Augmenting the BEC attack chain and defeating defenses
Although all types of cybercriminals can benefit from obtaining sensitive corporate data, it is
especially helpful for those conducting attacks based on social engineering. ACTI assesses
with high confidence that the availability of sensitive corporate data makes it increasingly
difficult for employees of victim organizations to spot fake communications and avoid such
attacks because actors can base their attacks on genuine documents from the victim
organization. ACTI found that the most disclosed data types overlap with the data types
most useful for conducting BEC and VEC attacks: financial, employee, and communication
data, and operational documents (Exhibit 5). The “other” category includes marketing and
training materials, etc. of less value to cybercriminals than the distinct data types above.

ACTI assesses that the primary factor driving an increased threat of BEC and VEC attacks
stemming from double-extortion leaks is the availability of data like that described above.
This data is most useful during the reconnaissance and social engineering phases,
particularly as the latter pertains to sending false invoices.
During the reconnaissance phase, malicious actors may study and weaponize the vast
troves of sensitive internal company data, which provide rich sources of social engineering
information. This includes insurance data, salary information, lease agreements, bank
reconciliations, and more (highlighted in Exhibit 6).

The social engineering phase is the most important and traditionally the most difficult part of
a BEC attack and the phase that benefits most from dedicated leak site data. BEC attacks
are inherently based on social engineering, with few technical roadblocks. This makes good
social engineering the single most important determinant of a successful BEC attack. Highquality, well-crafted, and accurately scoped social engineering ploys give threat actors the
ability to have higher success. Such data is a rich source of information about a victim
company’s day-to-day operations. A threat actor can increase the likelihood that a social
engineering ploy will succeed by determining a target’s internal language, such as
company-specific acronyms and phrases, allowing threat actors to avoid use of nonstandard company language, a tell-tale sign of fraud. Dedicated leak site data further
reduces the likelihood of a target discovering a social engineering ploy by allowing actors to
better adhere to internal organizational pathways. For example, it facilitates following
typical, anticipated communication channels and command chains.
Finally, malicious actors can use this data to improve the timing of an attack. Actors can
initiate a social engineering ploy when the targeted individual and organization are most
vulnerable, such as during acquisitions or vendor contract renewals, while traveling, or
when other information is available only through insider knowledge. For VEC attacks, these
effects are even more powerful, given the large amounts of sensitive dumped data that is
normally shared only between a primary target and its vendors. Specifically, contractual
data, invoices, financial agreements, payment schedules, orders, and purchase histories
are all abundantly available on dedicated leak sites, enabling actors to mimic a vendor more
closely than they could otherwise.
The final step of a BEC or VEC attack often involves sending a fraudulent invoice to a victim
or a victim’s supplier. Dedicated leak site data often includes genuine invoices that actors
can easily alter for use in an attack. Exhibit 7 shows a genuine invoice ACTI found on the
Industrial Spy data extortion site, obfuscated to protect potential victims. After carrying out a
well-crafted social engineering campaign, an actor could change such an invoice’s
accounting details (marked with a blue arrow) to an actor-controlled account and send the
modified invoice to the target.

ACTI found similar invoices in nearly all dumps across various dedicated leak sites. In
addition, an ACTI search for invoices in July 2022 rendered more than 10,000 hits on two
leak sites alone, showcasing the vast volumes of data available.
Beyond enabling a threat actor to conduct a more sophisticated attack, this type of data
circumvents traditional socialengineering attack defenses.
Conclusion
The widespread disclosure of data as part of ransomware attacks has flooded the criminal
underground with sensitive data from corporate networks that practically anyone can view
and obtain. The availability of the data has synergetic effects. First, operators can leverage
the data to augment and enrich entire BEC and VEC attack chains. Second, the data can
circumvent defenses that the industry has been promoting to protect against attacks based
on social engineering.
The availability of internal data also increases the risk of secondary attacks driven by but
unrelated to initial ransomware events. Such risk extends beyond a primary ransomware
attack victim to other organizations that do business with the victim or who operate within
the victim’s supply chain.
Mitigations
To prevent BEC attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and consumers:
Remain skeptical of changes in payment plans, even from genuine invoices and
trusted vendors or suppliers.
Validate invoice amounts through a communication medium that differs from the one
through which an invoice was received.
Remain extra vigilant against new invoices or communications regarding payments
after a data exfiltration event, whether that event occurred at one’s own company or at
a company within the same supply chain.
To prevent and mitigate socialengineering attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and
consumers:
Check the source of each email and ensure email senders are genuine.
Look up phone numbers to determine their legitimacy before returning unforeseen
calls and avoid providing sensitive data to unknown callers.
Locate official website URLs rather than clicking on links within messages.
Use multi-factor authentication to prevent or delay the success of an attack in which
actors access passwords through social engineering.
Continuously monitor critical systems.
Identify and protect critical assets.
Regularly check SSL certificates.
9/11

Maintain a closed and controlled digital footprint; oversharing of personal details
online through social media offers criminals more information to work with.
Train employees to limit the amount of work information they share on social media
platforms and how to identify social engineering ploys.
To prevent and mitigate data extortion attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and
consumers:
Limit or avoid the exposure of internal corporate technical procedures and
infrastructure in presentations from third-party technology partners.
