Version 1.0

1. Executive Summary
Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is an actor involved in several advanced persistent threat (APT)
campaigns that have been active going back to at least the end of 2010. Targeted sectors
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Industrial/machinery
Manufacturing
Pharmaceutical
Construction
Education
Information technology

Most of the victims we identified fall into the industrial / machinery building sector, indicating this
is of special interest.
To infect the victims, the attackers rely on three methods:
•
•
•

Spearphishing using PDF documents embedded with a flash exploit (CVE-2011-0611)
Trojanized software installers
Waterhole attacks using a variety of re-used exploits

During the attacks, the Crouching Yeti uses several malware / Trojans, which exclusively infect
Windows systems:
•
•
•
•
•

Havex Trojan
Sysmain Trojan
The ClientX backdoor
Karagany backdoor and related stealers
Lateral movement and second stage tools

For command and control, these connect to a large network of hacked websites. These sites
host malware modules, victim information and issue commands to infected systems.
The dozens of known Yeti exploit sites and their referrer sites were legitimate, compromised
sites. They ran vulnerable content management systems or vulnerable web applications. None
of the exploits used to compromise the servers were known to be zero-day. None of the client
side exploits re-used from the open source metasploit framework were zero-day.
Overall, we observed about 2,800 victims worldwide, the most prevalent attack tool being the
Havex Trojan.

We believe this group is highly determined and focused on a very specific industrial sector of
vital interest. It uses a variety of ways to infect its victims and exfiltrate strategic information.
The analyzed data seems to suggest the following points:
●
●
●
●

It is not currently possible to determine the Country of origin The attackers’ global focus
is much broader than power producers
Their toolset has remained stable over time
Managed, minimal, methodical approach to sustained operation
Appropriate use of encryption (symmetric key protected with attackers public key for
encrypted log file exfiltration)

This report provides technical details on how they perform their operations.

2. Analysis
This section analyzes all the aspects we could find about how this actor performs its campaigns.
The Crouching Yeti actor performed a massive surveillance operation targeting strategic victims,
many of them in the industrial/manufacturing sector.
There were different ways of delivering of its malware including waterholing, spearphishing and
adding malware to legitimate installers. Once the victims were infected, Crouching Yeti selected
different RATs for its operations. These RATs communicated with Command and Control
servers on compromised servers around the world, using a simple PHP backend.
We were able to identify several victims, including high-profile ones and dozens of domains
used in the campaign.

2.1. Delivery
As far as we know the group behind Crouching Yeti delivers its malware using at least three
different methods.

1. Legitimate software installers
The first method uses a legitimate software installer repackaged to contain the malicious DLL.
Such modified self-extracting archives could have been uploaded directly to a compromised
server, replacing the original file, or sent to the victim by email.
One example of this method was a hijacked SwissRanger camera driver (libMesaSR version
1.0.14.706) that was used to drop the Sysmain backdoor to:
%APPDATA%\sydmain.dll

and set the Run registry value to load malicious DLL upon next system startup.

TLP: Green

Figure 1. MESA Camera description

In a similar manner, as early as January 2014, Havex version 038 appears to have been
dropped by a legitimate ~40MB software installer from the eWon web site:
hxxp://www.ewon.biz/software/eCatcher/eCatcherSetup.exe
“eWon” is a Belgian producer of SCADA and industrial network equipment, which helps define
this attack method as a watering hole attack:

“Breaking the barrier between industrial applications and IT standards, the mission of eWON is to connect
industrial machines securely to the Internet, enabling easy remote access and gathering all types of
technical data originating from industrial machines...Connecting machines across the Internet is our
mission.”

Sometimes, the Havex loader was dropped from “eCatcherSetup_v4.exe”, so it seems that the
site operators may have removed a previous file and the attackers replaced it with their
trojanized installer, and so on. Likely, the attackers gained access to eWon’s ftp site and
replaced the legitimate file with one that is bound with the Havex dropper several times.

TLP: Green

Figure 2. eWon website screenshot

Another example that involves a hijacked application from a PLC-related vendor is a Trojanized
mbCHECK installer which replaced the original legitimate version freely downloadable from the
vendor's website. The legitimate version can be downloaded for free from the vendor’s website.
The vendor - MB Connect Line - is a company which specializes in software for remote
maintenance of PLC systems: MB Connect Line
GmbH(hxxp://www.mbconnectline.com/index.php/en/).

TLP: Green

Figure 3. MB Connect Line website

In this case, the dropped DLL was Havex version 043.

2. Malicious XDP file – spear-phishing
The second method relies on a malicious XDP file containing the PDF/SWF exploit (CVE-20110611) and was most probably used in spear-phishing attacks. This exploit drops the Havex
loader DLL, which is stored in an encrypted form in the XDP file.
The exploit is delivered as an XDP file (XML Data Package) which is actually a PDF file
packaged within an XML container. This is a known the PDF obfuscation method and serves as
an additional anti-detection layer.
The XDP file contains an SWF exploit and two files (encrypted with XOR) stored in the invalid
section of the PDF. One of the files is Havex DLL (version 038), the other is a small JAR file
which is used to copy and run the DLL by executing the following command:
cmd /c copy <fname_passed_as_param> %TEMP%\\explore.dll /y &
rundll32.exe %TEMP%\\explore.dll,RunDllEntry

TLP: Green

8

SWF executes the action script, which contains another SWF file which in turn uses the CVE2011-0611 vulnerability to run the shellcode.
The shellcode then looks for a specific signature in the memory (which signs the start of
encrypted DLL), decrypts and loads it.

3. Malicious JAR/Html files – waterholing

Finally, this actor actively compromises legitimate websites for watering hole attacks. These
hacked websites in turn redirect to malicious JAR or html files hosted on other sites maintained
by the group (exploiting CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-1347, and CVE-2012-1723 in Java 6, Java
7, IE 7 and IE 8), which then drop the Havex loader, the Karagany backdoor and helper
tools. These sites run an exploit kit known as “LightsOut”. It appears that the “LightsOut”
exploit kit is exclusively used by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti.
From the dozens of Yeti exploit sites we reviewed, the malicious code was nothing more than
slightly modified metasploit java exploits delivering the Havex loader. Some sort of internal
review must have pushed them towards the LightsOut EK. KSN data records help provide a list
of Crouching Yeti related exploit delivery from dozens of these sites.
In earlier cases (July 2013), successful Java exploitation served from nahoonservices.com
would cascade into more Yeti components planted on victim systems. The java exploit
downloaded Karagany backdoors, which in turn downloaded stealers from 91.203.6.71:

TLP: Green

Figure 4. Infection diagram

Ksn data recorded at least 20 victim sites that were compromised and injected with Yeti iframes,
redirecting hundreds of visitors to compromised Yeti exploit sites. Most of these redirector sites
were owned by western and Eastern European power players, investors, legal advisors and
advocates, and European and US industrial IT equipment makers. The compromised sites
hosting the LightsOut Exploit Kit were fairly trafficked, legitimate sites. Their content varies
widely, from California winemakers to Cuban travel agencies and Iranian general
interest/religious inspiration sites.

TLP: Green

10

Finally, other second stage tools were simply retrieved by the downloaders over http from various servers. Some of these Yeti sites, like kinoporno.org,
served both Havex and these tools. KSN events recorded the sites serving Windows Credential Editor and custom credential and document stealing
tools.

2.2. Malware
The Crouching Yeti group has different tools of choice for their operations. This section
describes them from a technical perspective.

2.2.1 The Havex Loader

1. Description
The main functionality of this component is to download and load additional DLL modules into
the memory. These are stored on compromised websites that act as C&C servers. In order to
do that, the malware injects itself into the EXPLORER.EXE process, sends a GET/POST request
to the PHP script on the compromised website, then reads the HTML document returned by the
script, looking for a base64 encrypted data between the two "havex" strings in the comment tag
<!--havexhavex--> and writes this data it to a %TEMP%\<tmp>.xmd file (filename is generated
by GetTempFilename function).
In the meantime, another routine is constantly checking the %TEMP% folder for all *.xmd files. For
each file it finds, it decompresses the content, decrypts (if encrypted) and loads into the memory
as the DLL.
In order to run on each system boot, malware copies itself to: <path>\TMPprovider0XX.dll
and creates the autorun registry key.
All samples of this component contain a statically linked bzip2 library. Versions >= 01B also
contain an RSAeuro library, used to encrypt log files and decrypt downloadable modules. Public
keys for encryption are hardcoded in the binary and/or stored in the configuration section. In
some cases, these keys are written to the registry values.
In total, we identified 124 different samples of Havex loaders, belonging to 27 different versions.
As of June 2014, the latest version number we have is 044.

2. C&C communication
The URL addresses of the C&C servers (which are indeed compromised websites) are either
hardcoded in the binary, or - in versions => 038 - specified in the configuration section inside the
ICT resource. This resource is compressed with bzip2 and encrypted with XOR.
There are usually 2-4 URLs per binary, different for each malware version and sometimes also
different between samples of the same version.

TLP: Green

12

Malware sends a GET request (versions < 017) or POST request to the first available URL. The
request contents depends on the malware version and it may include such information as
unique bot id, malware version number, OS version number, and some other data from
configuration, as well as the harvested information logged into the *.yls file (if any). Then the
malware searches the HTML code of each returned page for havex markers and saves the data
between the markers into a temporary file.

3. Downloadable modules - common characteristics
These modules are hosted between the havex markers in the HTML code of compromised
websites. The module code is usually XORed with ”1312312” then compressed with BZIP2 and
finally base64 encoded. Once downloaded into the %TEMP%\*.xmd file by the main Havex DLL,
the code is decoded, decompressed, saved into the temporary DLL file and loaded into the
memory.
The modules perform a variety of different actions, including collecting information about the
victim’s system and other machines in the local network, harvesting passwords, listing
documents, etc. In order to do that, some of the modules make use of additional 3rd stage 3rd
party executables.
Each module contains configuration information stored in an encrypted and compressed form
inside a resource. Configuration data includes 29-byte UID (unique ID), a 1024-bit RSA Public
key (base64 encoded) and other necessary info (like file paths, etc.). All harvested data is
compressed, encrypted and written into the %TEMP%\*.yls files, which are then sent to the
C&C by the main Havex/Sysmain module.
The “yls” files are encrypted with the 3DES crypto algorithm using a random 192-bit key (168 bit
effective). The 3DES key is encrypted using the public RSA 1024 key and therefore never
transferred in plain text to attackers.
In-depth analysis of the cryptography used by log files is presented in Appendix 2

4. List of known modules
OPC scanner
This module is designed to collect detailed data about the OPC servers running in the local
network and save them to a %TEMP%\{rand}.yls file. To query the OPC servers, it uses the
following interfaces:

Sysinfo module
This module collects basic information about the system it's running on, and saves it to the
%TEMP%\{rand}.yls file. Harvested data includes:
●
●

Files folders and root directories on all drives.

Contact stealer module
This module collects contact details stored in all outlook.nk2 files and writes them to the
%TEMP%\{rand}.yls file.
Outlook.nk2 is the file where Outlook (version since 2007) keeps contact details in order to use
them with the AutoComplete feature.
Password stealer module
This module uses the embedded BrowserPasswordDecryptor 2.0 tool
(hxxp://securityxploded.com/browser-password-decryptor.php) to dump login credentials stored
by the password managers of various browsers. Decrypted passwords are saved into the
%TEMP%\~tmp1237.txt file, which is then copied by the parent module into an encrypted
*.tmp.yls file.

2.2.2 The Ddex Loader

1. Description
This component is a simple downloader with a functionality similar to the Havex component.
It sends requests to the PHP script at the C&C (compromised website) and looks for specific
data in the returned HTML code.
It writes the data (some ASCII strings) from between <I6></I6> tags to the file in
%TEMP%\Low\~task.tmp and the data (binary data XORed with 0x0A) from between <B6></B6>

tags into the %TEMP%\Low\~ldXXXX.TMP file.
Then it decrypts the ldXXXX.TMP file and loads it into memory.
Based on the compilation times, we may assume that this loader was used to download and run
modules before it was replaced by Havex.
The Ddex loader is analyzed in more detail in Appendix 4.

2.2.3 The Sysmain backdoor

1. Description
This malware can be described as a classical RAT (Remote Access Trojan), since it gives the
attacker a wide range of opportunities to control and interact with the victim machine.
The autonomous part of Sysmain installs and registers itself to be persistent in the system.
Then it gathers general information about the victim system, like
●
●
●
●
●
●

User- and computer names
Locale information
Network- and drive status
Default browsers
Running processes
File listing from the user profile directory.

When ready, this data is submitted to one of the C&C-servers. After that, it checks periodically
for new commands from C&C (pulling via HTTP).

TLP: Green

16

With a set of 11 commands, the malware is able to:
●
●
●
●

Execute shell-commands
Launch additional executables or libraries (sent by the attacker)
Collect arbitrary files for later exfiltration
Examine the victim’s file system.

There are also commands used for maintenance purposes. Among others, there are commands
to change the pubkey for C&C-communication or delete its traces in the registry.

2. C&C communication
It receives its commands from one of four static command-and-control servers. Every variant of
this malware has its own set of servers.
As usual, the attackers are using webservers - most likely compromised ones - as part of their
C&C-infrastructure. To communicate with the C&C-server, the Trojan makes use of asymmetric
encryption with a hardcoded pair of private and public keys.
Another public key is used to encrypt files, which are collected in a local dropzone on the
victim’s file system. The files in that dropzone will be submitted to the attacker later, all in one
go.
Appendix 3 provides in-depth analysis of the Sysmain backdoor.

2.2.4 The ClientX backdoor

1. Description
This component is written in .NET and is very similar to The Sysmain backdoor.
The settings of the RAT are stored in the registry as BASE64 encoded values.
The RAT gets its commands by sending a request to a PHP script on the C&C (compromised
server) as usual, and looks for specific data in the returned HTML code. The data in this case is
stored between the havexhavex tags, it is then decrypted and decoded (base64).
The RAT supports 13 commands including:
·
·
·

Screen capture
Trojan Update
Loading DLLs

TLP: Green

17

·
·
·

Starting executables
Running shell commands
Listing directories

Each time a command (task) is executed, the result of that command is stored in the registry
under a subkey named “done” or “doneEXT”.
The results (which are called “answers” by the authors) are then POSTED to the C&C server.
The ClientX backdoor is analyzed in depth in Appendix 5.

2.2.5 The Karagany Backdoor

1. Description
Karagany is a simple backdoor that connects to the C&C and keeps waiting for commands. It
can download and run additional executables, load/delete modules, read file content, reboot the
computer, update itself and remove all components.
Besides backdoor functionality, it also extracts credentials from Internet Explorer’s password
manager to the prx.jpg file and injects a small DLL into the processes of web browsers. This
DLL keeps listening to outgoing network traffic and looking for basic access authentication
details sent over unencrypted HTTP. Affected browsers include Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Mozilla and Opera.
When executed, it copies itself to the folder under %APPDATA% and creates a .lnk file in the
%STARTUP% directory. The folder name and filename are chosen from a list of strings hardcoded
in the binary:

TLP: Green

It also creates the C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\ folder, where the information harvested by
downloaded modules will be stored.
After checking if a connection to the Internet is up, it sends an initial POST request to the C&C
server. Known parameters used in C&C communication are:
●

&identifiant=<victim_uid>, which is calculated based on system version, system

install date, username and system metrics
●
●

&version=<bot_version_nr>
&fichier=<file_content>

2. List of known modules:
Screenshot module
This module is used to drop and run the DuckLink CmdCapture tool - a 3rd party freeware
AutoIt application for capturing screenshots (hxxp://www.ducklink.com/).
A screenshot of the desktop is saved into the C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\scs.jpg file.
Additionally, other system information - such as the date and time of capture, computer name,
username, cpu architecture, os version, IP address, logon domain and logon server, desktop
details (height, width, depth, refresh rate) and environmental variables - are logged in
C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\scs.txt file.
Module listing documents and other files
This module is used to list all files and documents with specified extensions, or which have
names containing specified strings in the C:\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\fls.txt file.
Saved information includes path, size and modification time.

2.3. C&C servers and victims
The Command and Control Servers are compromised legitimate websites, like Blogs, from
different countries.
In total we have identified 219 unique domain names for these C&C servers hosted in 21
different countries.
We found most hosted C&Cs in the United States (81 servers), Germany (33 servers), the
Russian Federation (19 servers) and the United Kingdom (7 servers).

65 of these C&C servers, in the following countries, were monitored during our investigation.

This monitoring enabled us to get a list of the victims connected to them.

1. C&C backend
The C&C Backend is written in PHP, consisting of 3 files:
•

“log.php” is a Web-Shell, used for file level operations.

•

“testlog.php” is not a PHP-script but it contains the C&C Server logfile of Backdoorconnections. Please see “source.php” below for further information.

•

“source.php”

The Backdoors interact with “source.php”, which is the control script. These are its functions on
execution:

3. Write all transferred HTTP-GET Variables to “<botID>.log”, separated by “Tabulator” and
base64-encoded.
4. If the bot executes an HTTP-POST-request, the transferred data is written to the file
“<botID>.ans”, enclosed in “xdata”-Tag with timestamp. (“ans” is the acronym for
“Answer”).
5. Check for any “<botID>_*.txt” files
a. If found the first step is to append the timestamp, filename and a “sent” Status
indicated to “<botID>.log”. Then the file content is transferred to the bot,
embedded into HTML with the HTML-Body “No data!” and the HTML-Comment

TLP: Green

“havex”, which contains the data to be transferred. Finally the file on the server is
removed. If this removal fails it is logged to “<botID>.log”.
b. If no matching file is found, an HTML-Response is sent with an empty “havex”
HTML-Comment and HTML-Body text “Sorry, no data corresponding to your
request.”

2.3.1. Victims
The term “victim” in this section refers to a botID (unique String of the Backdoor), connecting to
one or more C&C Servers. Based on the 45 C&C Servers wemonitored, a total of 2,811 unique
Victims were discovered.
The average number of victims per C&C is 70:

Figure 7. Number of victims (Y) per C&C server instance (X)

The following chart depicts the first (red line) and last (blue line) appearance of each victim on
the C&C.
The “FirstHit” shows how the rate of accumulating new victims has accelerated over the course
of 2014. “LastHit” shows how the last connection of victims to C&C servers also increases over
time. This could mean victims are disinfecting their computers, or it may be that they simply
report to a different C&C server that we do not monitor.

TLP: Green

Figure 8. Evolution of "FirstSeen" and "LastSeen" victims

Mapping the unique hits of victims per day also indicates a decrease of “active” infections. The
following chart clearly shows a difference between weekdays (groups of five higher bars) and
weekends (two lower bars). The daily unique hit-rate fell by about half from around 800
connections at the beginning of 2014 to around 400 connections per week-day by the middle of
the year:

Figure 9. Unique victims per day reporting to C&Cs

More than half of the victims always connect from the same IP address. Fewer than half of the
victims connect from two or more different IP addresses as the following graph shows.
TLP: Green

25

Figure 10. Number of different IPs per victim

This might indicate that some of the victims are behind proxies, which makes sense for
corporate environments. Victims using many different IP addresses may indicate laptops.
The following chart visualizes all the unique victims connecting to C&C servers. The main C&C
Servers can be clearly seen in Russia and the USA. The victims are distributed across 99
different countries.

1. Havex Victims
Based on our monitoring, the most widespread Backdoor is Havex with a total of 2,470 infected
systems, mostly based in USA and Spain:

32 different versions of Havex are used among all victims, with 51 victims left without any
identifiable Havex version. Havex Version 024, compiled at the end of 2012, is the most
widespread.

Figure 13. Havex version distribution

Besides the Havex version, the OS Version of the victim computer is also communicated to the
C&C server. The most common Operating System among victims is Windows XP, but Windows
8.1 is also on the list.

2. Sysmain Victims
The Sysmain victims connect to six of the monitored C&C servers, where 261 unique victims
were counted, located in 38 different countries.

3. ClientX Victims
Victims of the Clientx backdoor connect to 2 of the monitored C&C Servers, where 10 unique
Victims were counted in 5 different countries.

2.3.2. Victims-C&C relationship
Based on the analysis of the monitored C&C Servers we can identify some clusters based on
malware versions and the victims.
This graph visualizes these relations. Every dot represents a victim, different Backdoors and
versions are colored differently. The C&C Servers are also represented as dots where several
clients connect. Grey lines are connections from a victim to its C&C Server.

Figure 17. Clusters of victim-C&C relationships

Some C&C Servers are dedicated to a given version of a backdoor (big Cluster). Others share
connections with different backdoor versions and different backdoors.
Breaking this down to the sectors of the identified victims, we cannot see any correlation
between C&Cs and victims. The same sectors are targeted with different backdoor versions.

3. Attribution
3.1. Non-specific Data
Compared to our other APT research the available data is more non-specific than usual. There
simply is no one piece or set of data that would lead to the conclusion that the threat actor is
Bear, Kitten, Panda, Salmon, or otherwise. Significant data points below.
File timestamp analysis and unique strings
It is rare to see file timestamps used as a precise, primary source of information when it comes
to threat actor attribution. In previous reports, these timestamps have been used as supporting,
or secondary pieces of data. They may help to suggest or support a time range for attacker
activity, but they are very easily modified. So it is not very helpful to focus on this data set.
The strings present in the backdoors, web components, and exploits are in English. Almost 200
malicious binaries and the related operational content all present a complete lack of Cyrillic
content, the opposite of our documented findings from researching Red October, Miniduke,
Cosmicduke, Snake, and TeamSpy.
The OPC module strings include typos and bad grammar. Some are so bad they are almost silly
and there doesn’t seem to be a consistent pattern here:
Programm was started at %02i:%02i:%02i
Start finging of LAN hosts...
Finding was fault. Unexpective error
Was found %i hosts in LAN:
Hosts was't found.
There are also three interesting strings inside the Karagany backdoor:
identifiant (which is French for identifier), fichier (French for file) and
liteliteliteskot (lite scot is Swedish for little sheet)
Timestamp details
Timestamp analysis is based on a total of 154 collected binaries:

The earliest samples related to this campaign are the Ddex loader binaries with
compilation timestamps between October and November 2010.
The first Havex loader samples, version 01 and version 02, have compilation timestamps
from 28th September 2011.
The latest known samples are Havex loader version 044, compiled on 7th May 2014,
and all OPC modules compiled in April and May 2014.
Most samples were compiled on weekdays, although there are a couple of samples with
the compilation timestamp from a Saturday.
Most samples were compiled between 6:00 and 16:00 UTC with a peak between 6:00
and 8:00 UTC.
○ Earliest compilation time: 02:15:23 UTC (Wed, 28 Sep 2011)
○ Latest time: 23:39:34 UTC (Thu, 02 Jun 2011)

3.2. Exploit server activity
All the exploit servers delivered slightly modified ripped content from open source repositories.
All the servers appear to be hacked servers. According to the available data, no zero-day
exploits were used in any of these attacks, either to compromise the servers in the first place, or
delivered as client side attack exploits by the Lights Out Exploit Kit.
While this purely malicious re-use of metasploit PoC highlights the danger that these attack
tools pose, it is also unusual to see an exclusively metasploit attack toolset effectively used in
this way, delivered from what appear to be a chain of higher value compromised sites.
All of these compromised web applications were vulnerable to freely available offensive security
tools. We acknowledge that many of the compromised referrer servers were related to power
producers in some way. However, these targets almost seem an afterthought, as the exploit
servers themselves were compromised web servers from Cuban travel agency sites, a
Californian winery site, a US based women’s fashion site, an Iranian general interest/religious
inspiration site, a number of dating and adult content websites, and a variety of others.
Although, we note that the known Trojanized software packages were ICS/SCADA related as
well, possibly because those victim sets or environments required special attention. So, while
there was a strong set of offensive activities on power producers during the campaigns, it was
by no means the full focus of them.

3.3. Victim characteristics and categories
While it may be “shocking” to observe power producers around the world targeted by any one
threat actor, this actor’s attack activity does not appear to be constrained to power producers.
The related industries of interest show a much broader global scope than previously discussed,
and the geographic regions of interest have gone completely undiscussed. For example, Spain
had the highest number of victims. However, it appears that there was no significant correlation
between the victim location and the C&C geolocation. And, according to our data, the list also
includes victim organizations fitting the following additional categories:
•

4. Conclusions
The Crouching Yeti actor has been performing massive surveillance campaigns in recent years,
since at least 2010. Their targets included thousands of victims of which we were able to identify
a few, confirming Crouching Yeti’s interest in several strategic sectors.
The distribution strategy of the group focuses on methods following this targeted philosophy,
including spear phishing and waterholing. Noticeably, they also compromised legitimate
software packages from strategic actors in the SCADA sector in order to infect their final victims.
The victim list confirms that the tactic proved successful.
There is nothing especially sophisticated in their exploits, or in the malware they used to infect
victims. Their RATs are flexible enough to perform surveillance and data exfiltration efficiently.
They used dozens of compromised servers as Command and Control domains with a simple,
but effective, PHP backend.
However there is an interesting connection with this group and the LightsOut Exploit Kit for the
distribution of its malware in some waterholing attacks. We believe they are likely its only
operators as of June 2014.
Thanks to the monitoring of several of the Command and Control domains used by the group,
we were able to identify several victims. This victims’ list reinforces the interests shown by the
Crouching Yeti actor in strategic targets, but also shows the interest of the group in many other
not-so-obvious institutions. We believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be fair
to redefine the Crouching Yeti actor not only as a highly targeted one in a very specific area of
interest, but a broad surveillance campaign with interests in different sectors.
We will continue monitoring this actor.
