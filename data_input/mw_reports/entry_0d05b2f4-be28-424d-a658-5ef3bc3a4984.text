SECURITY RESEARCH REPORT

Targeting
The majority of SilkBean samples acquired by Lookout in 2016 and 2017 have titles like com.google.pay and com.android.
google.service, which the average user might find innocuous on an Android device. Most later samples had app icons and titles
identifying them as Uyghur targeted as shown in the following figure.

While at least two samples have a direct reference to Uyghur specific applications, such as Uyghur Keyboard, (Uyghur) Alphabet and Uyghur
Plugin, one is titled “ ‫ ” ئىستىقالل‬which may be loosely translated as “Independence” in Arabic. Another recent sample is titled TalkBox, a pushto-talk messaging application commonly used in China.

A SilkBean sample (SHA-1: 3da34aaf95ffcb5c5d36c2a9fc5 42c1b08c36d2f) uncovered in June 2019 prompted a closer look
at the family. It had the title “ ‫” اخبار سوريا‬, which translates to “Syria News” in Arabic. Despite the app title, the content of the
application was still specifically Uyghur-focused - all news stories could be viewed in the three different scripts used for the
Uyghur language.

immediately and uses this
opportunity to install another
application which contains
legitimate functionality, also
retrieved from it’s assets folder

The application does not attempt
to hide its icon either. As is
discussed later however, the
current C2 content encourages
users to disable this security

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORT

Lookout researchers also uncovered six applications
requesting invasive permissions that connect to islamapk[.]
com, with very telling package names as to who is being
targeted. Two of the applications are known SilkBean
samples, while the remaining are not yet classified into
any known families, but appear to look for a second stage
download from islamapk[.]com, which at the time of writing
could not be accessed. Two of the applications’ package
names are com.uyghur.hunter.islamapk, and the other two
are com.islamapk.uy, which is consistent with the targeting of
Uyghurs that Lookout researchers have seen.

Connections to Other Uyghur-targeted
Surveillanceware
The detailed investigation into SilkBean apps and
infrastructure provided the starting point for piecing
together the different elements of this mAPT into a larger
picture. Starting from the IP address (213.128.81[.]82) of
the two previously mentioned C2 servers of SilkBean (www.
englishedu-online[.]com and www.turkyedu-online[.]com) we
found that a number of similar C2 servers had also resolved
to the same IP address. This resolution has not changed since
January 2016 (for turkyedu-online[.]com) and October 2017
(for www.englishedu-online[.]com).

A Maltego graph showing the resolutions of SilkBean’s C2 domains to the IP addresses 213.128.81[.]82 and 31.210.106[.]90 as well as some
other domains resolving to the same IPs since February 2016. This image was compiled using RiskIQ’s Passive DNS data. OSINT15 and RiskIQ16
research indicates that uyghurappbazar[.]com and overxtube[.]com are already publicly associated with Android malware17. Many sites have a
naming convention with the pattern “*edu-online.com” and the rest appear to contain innocuous names or reference Uyghur-specific content,
such as otkaxbazar[.]com.

SECURITY RESEARCH REPORT

DoubleAgent’s connection to other malware families
In late 2019 novel DoubleAgent samples appeared that had
evolved significantly from previous versions, and a closer
look at their configuration and C2 infrastructure highlighted
new connections to SilkBean, HenBox and DarthPusher. This
strengthened the theory that the actor behind DoubleAgent
is also involved in the deployment, and perhaps even
development, of these other malware families.

titled “Disk photo recovery”, “SafeUM”, “Quran” and “Alphabet”,

contained links to known SilkBean C2 infrastructure.

belonging to the HenBox, DarthPusher and CarbonSteal
Android surveillance families. CarbonSteal is another novel
malware family described in the next section of this report.
This confirms the theory that the actor behind the deployment
and use of the samples of these malware families is the same.
An overlap in validity dates of these signing certificates may
also indicate that these tools were under development and
use in the same timeframe, starting in early 2015.
Finally, code similarities in these samples of SilkBean,
HenBox, DarthPusher, CarbonSteal and DoubleAgent also

being signed with a certificate that has also been used

CarbonSteal is Android surveillanceware that has been
tracked by Lookout since 2017, and more than 500 samples
have been seen to date. While not as sophisticated as HenBox,
certain samples of CarbonSteal do make use of a combination
of native libraries and DEX classes, while others do not and are
much simpler.
Hallmarks of CarbonSteal include extensive audio recording
functionality in a variety of codecs and audio formats, as well
as the capability in later samples to control an infected device
through specially crafted SMS messages. Attackers can also
perform audio surveillance through the malware’s ability to
silently answer a call from a specific phone number and allow
the attacker to listen in to sounds around an infected device.
Based on this functionality, we suspect that CarbonSteal
might be deployed in areas with insufficient or no mobile data
coverage.

has resurfaced in samples signed and analysed in May 2020.

Mapping out when apps trojanized with GoldenEagle were signed shows the actors’ activity. A clear spike in samples belonging to this family
took place during 2016, and new samples have continued to be observed in 2020. At this point it is unclear whether these new samples are
part of testing or a re-emergence of GoldenEagle activity, as these newer samples appear to be largely unchanged and possess the test title
“Golden.eagle”.

provide Uyghur-specific news and content), Nur.cn News
(also delivers Uyghur-specific content) and the Uyghur Quran,
among others.

The expanse of applications trojanized by GoldenEagle also

(Quick Search Tibet), “西藏同程游记” (Travel Notes in Tibet) and
“美丽西藏精选壁纸” (Beautiful Tibet Featured Wallpaper) that
appeared to focus on individuals living or travelling in Tibet.

The actors behind GoldenEagle have deployed trojanized versions of a staggeringly large and diverse set of applications. This level of technical
investment combined with the longevity of operations suggests that GoldenEagle is being managed by a well-resourced adversary. Shown
