Sandworm continues to conduct attacks against carefully chosen targets in the war-torn
country
ESET researchers have uncovered a new wiper attack in Ukraine that they attribute to the
Sandworm APT group.
Dubbed SwiftSlicer, the destructive malware was spotted on the network of a targeted
organization on January 25th. It was deployed through Group Policy, which suggests that
the attackers had taken control of the victim‚Äôs Active Directory environment.
Some of the wipers spotted by ESET in Ukraine early into Russia‚Äôs invasion ‚Äì
HermeticWiper and CaddyWiper ‚Äì were in some instances also planted in the same
fashion. The latter was last spotted on the network of Ukraine‚Äôs news agency Ukrinform just
days ago.

SwiftSlicer is detected by ESET products as WinGo/KillFiles.C. The malware was written in
Go, a highly versatile, cross-platform programming language.
When it comes to SwiftSlicer‚Äôs method of destruction, ESET researchers had this to say:
‚ÄúOnce executed it deletes shadow copies, recursively overwrites files located in
%CSIDL_SYSTEM%\drivers, %CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE%\Windows\NTDS and other nonsystem drives and then reboots computer. For overwriting it uses 4096 bytes length block
filled with randomly generated byte‚Äù.
Two months ago, ESET detected a wave of RansomBoggs ransomware attacks in the wartorn country that were also linked to Sandworm. The campaigns were just one of the latest
additions to the long r√©sum√© of damaging attacks that the group has conducted against
Ukraine over the past near-decade. Sandworm‚Äôs track record also includes a string of
attacks ‚Äì BlackEnergy, GreyEnergy and the first iteration of Industroyer ‚Äì that targeted
energy providers. An Industroyer2 attack was thwarted with help from ESET researchers in
April of last year.
