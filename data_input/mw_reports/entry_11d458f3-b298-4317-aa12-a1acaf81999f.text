Malicious Office Files Dropping Kasidet And Dridex
zscaler.com/blogs/research/malicious-office-files-dropping-kasidet-and-dridex

Introduction
We have covered Dridex Banking Trojan being delivered via various campaigns involving
Office documents with malicious VBA macros in the past. However, over the past two
weeks we are seeing these malicious VBA macros leveraged to drop Kasidet backdoor in
addition to Dridex on the infected systems. These malicious Office documents are being
spread as an attachment using spear phishing emails as described here. The malicious
macro inside the Office document is obfuscated as shown in the code snapshot below -

Macro code
The macro downloads malware payload from the hardcoded URL. We have seen following
URLs used in different document payloads that we captured for this campaign:
armandosofsalem[.]com/l9k7hg4/b4387kfd[.]exe
trinity.ad-ventures[.]es/l9k7hg4/b4387kfd[.]exe

In this blog, we will provide a detailed analysis for the Kasidet variant that we spotted in this
campaign.

Kasidet Analysis
Installation:
Kasidet installs itself into %APPDATA% folder. It creates a new folder there with the name
"Y1FeZFVYXllb", this string is hardcoded in the malware. The same string is used as mutex
name and in creating a Registry key for ensuring persistence upon system reboot.
AntiVM Check:
Kasidet tries to detect analysis systems during execution through following checks.
Checking Dubugger through "IsDebuggerPresent" and "CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent"
Windows APIs. It also checks for the following popular sandbox related strings:
User Name: "MALTEST", "TEQUILABOOMBOOM", "SANDBOX", "VIRUS", "MALWARE"
File Name: "SAMPLE", "VIRUS", "SANDBOX"
It tries to detect wine software by checking if kernel32.dll is exporting
"wine_get_unix_file_name" function or not. It detects Vmware, VirtualBox, QEMU and
Bochs by checking for following registry entries:

Vmware

"SOFTWARE\\VMware, Inc.\\VMware
Tools"

"HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi
Port\Scsi Bus\Target Id\Logical Unit Id",
"Identifier" , Vmware"
"HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi
Port\Scsi Bus\Target Id\Logical Unit Id",
"Identifier" , "VBOX"

VirtualBox

"HARDWARE\\Description\\System",
"SystemBiosVersion" , "VBOX"
SOFTWARE\\Oracle\\VirtualBox Guest
Additions"
"HARDWARE\\Description\\System",
"VideoBiosVersion" , "VIRTUALBOX"

2/8

QEMU

"HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port
\Scsi Bus \Target Id \Logical Unit Id ",
"Identifier" , "QEMU"
"HARDWARE\\Description\\System" ,
"SystemBiosVersion" , "QEMU"

Bochs

"HARDWARE\\Description\\System" ,
"SystemBiosVersion" , "BOCHS”

Information Stealing capabilities:
Kasidet uses following two methods for stealing information from the victim's machine:
1. Memory Scraping – This allows Kasidet to steal credit card data from the memory of
Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems. It scans the memory of all the running processes except the
operating system processes listed below:
System
smss.exe
csrss.exe
winlogon.exe
lsass.exe
spoolsv.exe
devenv.exe
The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –
d=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&type=<Track1 or Track2 data>&data=
<stolen data>&p=< Process elevation status >
2. Browser Hooking– This allows Kasidet to steal data from Web browsers. It can inject
code into FireFox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer (IE). Browser names are not saved in
plain text and instead this variant uses the same hash function as used by Carberp malware
to encrypt the browser names. The following APIs are hooked in the web browser for
stealing sensitive data:
Browser

API

FireFox

PR_Write

Chrome

WSASend

3/8

IE

HttpSendRequestW , InternetWriteFile

The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –
ff=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&host=<Base64 encoded host name>&form=
< Base64 encoded HTTP header data>&browser=<Browser name>
The information stealing feature of this Kasidet variant were deactivated if the system locale
or GeoUserID corresponds to Russia.
Network communication:
Kasidet contains a hardcoded list of Command & Control (C&C) server locations. It uses
CryptStringToBinary API call to decrypt the embedded C&C URLs as seen below:

Kasidet C&C list
Upon successful infection, Kasidet sends a HTTP POST request with data “enter=1”
(without quotes). All HTTP header fields (User-Agent, Content-type and Cookie) are hard
coded in the payload itself.

Kasidet Hardcoded HTTP fields
C&C Server will not return required data if HTTP header fields are different. The server
sends a fake 404 response code and html data stating that page is not found but the C&C
commands will be hidden in the response HTML comment tag as seen below:

Kasidet - First communication with C&C

Kasidet will request for additional commands from the C&C server with the following POST
request:

Kasidet request for additional commands
Variable

Descriptions

cmd

Command. It is hardcoded in the malware payload as '1'.

id

MachineGuid value fetched from Software\Microsoft\Cryptography registry
key

name

System Name

os

Operating system version

p

Process elevation status

av

Antivirus installed on the infected system

v

Version of the bot. It is hardcoded in the malware. Current version that we
analysed is 4.4

w

Flag that indicates whether the system locale and UserGeoID is Russia

Like browser names, all the command strings are also encrypted using a hash function.
Below are some of the important commands:

Conclusion
Malicious Office document file is a popular vector for malware authors to deliver their
payloads. Dridex authors have leveraged this technique for over a year and it was
interesting to see the same campaign and URLs being leveraged to deliver Kasidet
payloads. While this does not establish any links between the two malware family authors, it
reaffirms the fact that a lot of the underlying infrastructure and delivery mechanisms are
often shared by these cyber criminals.
