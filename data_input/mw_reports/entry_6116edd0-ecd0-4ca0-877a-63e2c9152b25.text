Industroyer[1] (also referred to as Crashoverride) is a malware framework considered to
have been used in the cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid on December 17, 2016. [2] [3] [4]
The attack cut a fifth of Kiev, the capital, off power for one hour and is considered to have
been a large-scale test. [5] [6] The Kiev incident was the second cyberattack on Ukraine's
power grid in two years. The first attack occurred on December 23, 2015.[7] Industroyer is the
first ever known malware specifically designed to attack electrical grids. [8] At the same time,
it is the fourth malware publicly revealed to target industrial control systems, after Stuxnet,
Havex, and BlackEnergy.

Discovery and naming
The malware was discovered by Slovak internet security company ESET. ESET and most of
the cybersecurity companies detect it under the name “Industroyer”.[9] [10] Cybersecurity firm
Dragos named the malware “Crashoverride”. [8] In 2022, the Russian hacker group
Sandworm initiated a blackout in Ukraine using a variant of Industroyer aptly dubbed
Industroyer2.[11]

Description
The detailed analysis of Industroyer [12] revealed that the malware was designed to disrupt
the working processes of industrial control systems, specifically those used in electrical
substations. Industroyer is modular malware; its main components are the following:
A main backdoor is used to control all other components of the malware. It connects
to its remote Command & Control servers in order to receive commands from the
attackers.
An additional backdoor provides an alternative persistence mechanism that allows
the attackers to regain access to a targeted network in case the main backdoor is
detected and/or disabled.
A launcher component is a separate executable responsible for launching the
payload components and the data wiper component. The launcher component contains
a specific activation time and date; analyzed samples contained two dates: December
17, 2016 and December 20, 2016. (Note: the former date was the date the attack
actually went ahead.)

1/3

Four payload components target particular industrial communication protocols
specified in the following standards: IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850,
and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC Data Access). The functionalities of
the payload components include mapping the network, and then issuing commands to
the specific industrial control devices.
A data wiper component is designed to erase system-crucial Registry keys and
overwrite files to make the system unbootable and recovery from the attack harder.
