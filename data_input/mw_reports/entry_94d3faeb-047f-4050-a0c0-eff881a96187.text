Michigan State University received a deadline to pay ransomware attackers under the threat
that files stolen from the institution’s network will be leaked to the public.
The demand is from Netwalker ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators, a group that
recently started to recruit skilled network intruders for their affiliate program.

Proof of stolen data
A countdown timer on the attacker’s website shows that the university has about six days to
comply or “secret data” will become public.
The site set up by the Netwalker ransomware gang gives no details about the attack but they
posted images with directories, a passport scan, and two financial documents allegedly
stolen from the university’s network.

BleepingComputer reached out to Michigan State University (MSU) for more details about
the attack but received no reply at publishing time.
Information about how and when the attack happened, its impact on MSU, and the ransom
demand remain unknown at this time.

Antivirus removers to disable defenses
Netwalker ransomware relies on multiple programs for remote access (Team Viewer,
AnyDesk), files from public code repositories, and custom PowerShell scripts.
However, they also use at least three legitimate tools to uninstall security software on a
compromised system.
Researchers at Sophos security software and hardware company shared in a report
yesterday that the threat actor also used legitimate removal tools for ESET antivirus, Trend
Micro’s Security Agent, and Microsoft Security Client that is part of Microsoft Security
Essentials.
Apart from tools that enabled intrusion and lateral movement on the victim network, they
discovered "individual samples of the Zeppelin Windows ransomware and the Smaug Linux
ransomware as well."
In a trove of malicious files discovered while investigating a malware campaign from
Netwalker, the researchers also found that the attacker also leveraged several vulnerabilities
for privilege escalation.

One of them is CVE-2020-0796, for which there is proof-of-concept exploit code released for
local privilege escalation. It can also be exploited for remote code execution, but the code for
this is not currently available to the public.

Netwalker ransomware group advertised recently that they were looking for new
collaborators with access to large enterprise networks. The move is meant to distance
themselves from malware distribution through spam, which is a common method.
As an incentive, the group promised affiliates huge rewards, a cut between 80% and 84%
from paid ransoms. Other ransomware operators typically offer up to 70% from the ransom
money.
