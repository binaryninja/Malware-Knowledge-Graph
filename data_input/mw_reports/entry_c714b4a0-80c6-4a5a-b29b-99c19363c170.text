Sexually Explicit Material Used as Lures in Recent Cyber
Attacks

Sex sells. Cybercriminals know this and readily

use it as lures, as we have seen in past spam runs that used fake YouTube links or promised
photos of naked celebrities.
This month, actors of Operation Arid Viper and members of the Yanbian Gang jumped on the
sexually explicit content bandwagon, using them in separate attacks that target respective
victims in Israel and Kuwait, and South Korea.

Operation Arid Viper attacked five Israeli-based organizations in the government, transport,
infrastructure, military, and academic industries, and one organization in Kuwait using spearphishing emails that dropped a pornographic video on a victim's computer.
“It targeted professionals who might be receiving very inappropriate content at work and so
would hesitate to report the incident,” declares Trend Micro threat researchers in a recent
report of the Arid Viper discovery.

Meanwhile, fake versions of popular porn apps

were among the many lures that the Yanbian Gang used to infect millions of Android™
mobile banking customers in South Korea.
Mobile banking customers unknowingly downloaded malware apps, which mobile threat
researcher Simon Huang described to come "in the guise of popular porn apps with lewd
icons and names and eye-catching descriptions like 'sexy women photos' and 'porn movies.'
”
"They hardly ever deliver on their promise though when run. All they do, in fact, is steal and
upload victims’ mobile banking credentials to C&C servers," adds Huang.
When mobile users in South Korea download the apps—either through links sent via SMS or
from infected mobile downloads—their mobile phone numbers, account names and number,
and login credentials are automatically sent over to the Yanbian Gang members.

Battling Malicious Clicks and Urges
Threat actors rely on an element of shame from professionals who received the
pornographic video, care of Operation Arid Viper, to keep them from reporting the incident to
their IT departments. This gives attackers a longer window to use the malware to get
whatever information they can from the system. "These victims’ failure to act on the threat
could have then allowed the main malware to remain undiscovered. The attackers used a
distinct and likely successful strategy previously unseen when it came to avoiding incident
response team investigations," researchers stressed in the paper.
Most targeted attack strategies leave employees out of incident response solutions.
However, given that the human component is a typical weak spot in a system's defenses,
doing so is an oversight that can lead to data loss or theft.
We have previously noted that organizations need to complement security efforts with a
proactive security awareness program. This program should train the workforce to practice
safe habits and how to react to actual security incidents.

In addition, everyone should be reminded that sexually explicit content is a mainstay in a
cybercriminal's bag of targeted attack tricks. It is not just organizations that are in danger of
these schemes, as we have seen in the case of the South Korean mobile banking app
scheme.
Consumers and enterprises alike should establish proactive measures against targeted
attacks, which should also address malware and flaws in mobile devices.
