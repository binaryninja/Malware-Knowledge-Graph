TOM BURT, CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT, CUSTOMER SECURITY & TRUST

Over the past year the world has borne witness to a burgeoning cybercrime economy and the rapid rise
of cybercrime services. We have watched this global market grow in both complexity and fervency. We’ve
seen the cyberattack landscape becoming increasingly sophisticated as cybercriminals continue—and even
escalate—their activity in times of crisis. New levels of supply chain and ransomware attacks were a powerful
reminder that we must all work together, and in new ways, to protect the cybersecurity of the planet.

Our 2021 focus areas
2021 brought powerful reminders that to protect
the future we must understand the threats of the
present. This requires that we continually share data
and insights in new ways. Certain types of attacks
have escalated as cybercriminals change tactics,
leveraging current events to take advantage of
vulnerable targets and advance their activity through
new channels. Change brings opportunity—for both
attackers and defenders—and this report will focus
on the threats that are most novel and relevant to
the community as we look to the months ahead.
Looking at the threat landscape, along with data
and signals from cross-company teams, five toplevel areas emerged as most critical to bring into the

The growing threat of cybercrime

AMY HOGAN - BURNEY, GENERAL MANAGER, DIGITAL CRIMES UNIT

Cybercrime, whether nation state sponsored or permitted, is a threat to national security. Cybercriminals are
targeting and attacking all sectors of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and public health, information
technology (IT), financial services, and energy sectors. Ransomware attacks are increasingly successful, crippling
governments and businesses, and the profits from these attacks are soaring.
The cybercrime supply chain, often created by criminal syndicates, continues to mature allowing anyone to buy
the services needed to conduct malicious activity for financial gain or other nefarious purpose. Sophisticated
cybercriminals are also still working for governments conducting espionage and training in the new battlefield.

attacks, drawing attention to the problem and allowing
increased engagement from incident responders and
law enforcement. Second, now that governments
around the world recognize that cybercrime is a threat
to national security, they have made combatting it a
priority. Governments around the world are passing
new laws regarding reporting, creating crossgovernment task forces, allocating resources, and
seeking out private sector assistance.

networks, frontline investigations of customer attacks,
security and attack research, nation state threat
tracking, and security tool development, we continue
to see the cybercrime supply chain consolidate and
mature. It used to be that cybercriminals had to
develop all the technology for their attacks. Today,
they rely on a mature supply chain, where specialists
create cybercrime kits and services that other actors
buy and incorporate into their campaigns. With the
increased demand for these services, an economy of

specialized services has surfaced, and threat actors
are increasing automation to drive down their costs
and increase scale. For example, we are seeing an
increasing offer of backconnect proxies (proxies that
rotate between mobile, residential, and datacenter
systems) in addition to Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), virtual private network
(VPN), virtual private server (VPS), web shells, cPanels

anonymization systems.

Not all attacks work. It’s critical that we keep
improving our defenses to increase the failure rate
of attacks and the associated cost to attackers.

Organizations now face an industrialized attacker economy with skill specialization and trading of illicit
commodities. As seen in this snapshot of average prices, many commodities that can be purchased in
the dark markets are very inexpensive, making attacks cheaper and easier to conduct (which also drives
up attack volume).

Post-breach response
Just as the criminal enterprise that deploys
ransomware typically involves several stakeholders
each with a particular responsibility, the response to
ransomware also involves several key stakeholders.
If a victim of a ransomware attack has cyber
insurance, that carrier will employ certain service
providers, including an incident response firm, a
law firm, and an organization specializing in ransom

Depending on the jurisdiction of the victim, the
victim could be subject to data breach notification
requirements. A law firm will often assess the
exposure of the victim’s liability and assist the
victim with meeting its regulatory obligations.
Importantly, the law firm will interface with relevant
law enforcement, where appropriate. Finally, if a
victim is unable to return to business operations,
an organization specializing in negotiating with
ransomware criminal syndicates will work to obtain
the decryption key on behalf of the victim.

negotiation. Even if a victim does not have a cyber
insurance policy, these stakeholders are common to
finding a resolution to the ransom.
Once a ransomware gang locks a victims’ network,
exfiltrates data, and holds the network and
data for ransom, an incident response team will
investigate the root cause of the breach and drive
remediation efforts depending on the victim’s level
of preparedness prior to the attack. If the victim has
sufficient backups of its data or data has not been
stolen, often the incident response team will work
to remove the threat actor from the victim’s system,
restore business operations, and apply future
mitigation measures. The incident response team

Ransomware syndicates and affiliates are all working together toward these interconnected threats.
Rather than one individual behind a ransomware attack, there are multiple groups of individuals, similar
to a shared business model.

The business model for ransomware has effectively
evolved into an intelligence operation; criminal
actors perform research on their target victim to
identify an optimal ransom demand. Once a criminal
actor infiltrates a network, they may exfiltrate and
study financial documents and insurance policies.
They may also understand the penalties associated
with local breach laws. The actors will then extort
money from their victims, to not only unlock their
systems, but also to prevent disclosure of the
victim’s exfiltrated data to the public. After they’ve
collected and analyzed this intelligence, the criminal
actor will identify an “appropriate” ransom amount.

Here, the criminal actor explains “we examined all
financial documents, bank statements for the last
year, insurance. And came to the conclusion that
you are exaggerating about poor financial condition

lawsuits from both your staff and your students for
the leakage of their personal data. These fines will
exceed $30 million. We are not talking about the
loss of reputation, which in our opinion costs more.”

domains (as on the open web) as well as on the dark web or Tor (also known as The Onion Router).
As part of the double extortion business model, the actors behind Conti maintain a news site, which serves as
the publishing site to prove that if the ransom is not paid, the victim’s private information will be posted publicly
and could be sold on the black market. The Conti News site currently lists hundreds of victims with various
samples of their private data.
Conti victims are located mostly in the United States and Europe and include public schools, healthcare
providers, manufacturing companies, US city governments, and even public utility providers.

While the Colonial Pipeline ransom attack of May 2021 drew considerable public attention, our Detection

hospitals or healthcare companies during a pandemic, healthcare remains in the top-five sectors victimized by

Ransomware Playbook - Cyber Readiness Institute

Limit the scope of damage by forcing the attackers to work harder to gain access to multiple business-critical
systems. Establish least-privilege access and adopt Zero Trust principles. These steps make it harder for an
attacker who gets in to a network to travel across the network to find valuable data to lock up. Also, encrypt
data at rest, and practice good backup-and-restore hygiene. This way, even if data is stolen it will be encrypted
and not very useful to the attackers. In the unfortunate event that the attacker does encrypt your data, you will
have a good backup to restore from and use to maintain business continuity.
Make it harder to get in by following basic cybersecurity hygiene steps that make it more difficult for attackers
to gain access to the network. The most important of these steps is the use of multifactor authentication (MFA),
which is important to raising friction for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey.
Other steps, such as keeping up to date on patching and correct configuration, can be taken to identify and
close off vulnerable entry points.

Types of malicious emails
Whether their goal is to phish credentials, redirect
a wire transfer to their own bank account, or
download malware onto a machine, attackers are
most likely to utilize email as their initial entry
vector for a campaign. While a lot of focus is given
to credential phishing, malicious emails are used in
multiple types of cyber incidents. Microsoft security
researchers observe the following three most
common types of malicious emails:
PHISHING
Phishing is the most common type of malicious
email observed in our threat signals. These emails

Top 10 verticals affected by phishing (Defender detections, June 2021)

are designed to trick an individual into sharing
sensitive information, such as usernames and
passwords, with an attacker. To do this, attackers
will craft emails using a variety of themes, such
as productivity tools, password resets, or other
notifications with a sense of urgency to lure a user
to click on a link.
The phishing webpages used in these attacks may
utilize malicious domains, such as those purchased
and operated by the attacker, or compromised
domains, where the attacker abuses a vulnerability
in a legitimate website to host malicious content.

Meanwhile, the entered credentials are stored or
sent to the attacker for later abuse or sale.
Attackers also use consent phishing to send users
links that, if clicked, will grant the attacker access
and permissions to applications, such as via OAuth
2.0 authorization protocol. In these instances, users
may unwittingly grant the attackers permissions to
applications that enable them to access a wealth of
sensitive information.
The number of phishing emails observed in

during the period from June 2020 through June

potentially related to holiday-themed phishing, and
a subsequent decrease over the US winter holidays,

messages when many people are not working.

What’s in Microsoft’s phishing
defense toolbox? How we
approach employee awareness

Adversarial machine learning

Trends at Microsoft, 2020-2021

In 2020, the industry saw a surge of phishing campaigns that has
remained steady throughout 2021. Internally at Microsoft, we saw an
increase in overall number of phishing emails, a downward trend in
emails containing malware, and a rise in voice phishing (or vishing).
Fortunately, we were prepared with an effective foundation of protective controls to reduce the number of
successful phishing attempts, and acknowledging the evolving threat landscape, we had expanded our controls
to cover other vectors that could be exploited (beyond email, such as Forms and Teams).

What’s in our toolbox
There is not a silver bullet fix for phishing; it must be solved through a multipronged approach. We focus on four
primary elements: Protective controls, User awareness, Reporting and insights, and Detect and respond.

With these methods, we have seen a 50%
year-over-year reduction in susceptibility.

Summary of recommendations for malware prevention
1. Install security updates on all applications and operating systems promptly.
2. Enable real-time protection through an antimalware solution, such as Microsoft Defender.
3. Mitigate large attack vectors such as macro abuse, exposed edge services, insecure default configurations,
legacy authentication, unsigned script types, and suspicious executions from certain file types delivered
through email. Microsoft offers some of these larger mitigations through the use of attack surface
reduction rules21 to prevent malware infection. Azure Active Directory users may also leverage security
defaults22 to establish baseline authentication security for cloud environments.
4. Enable Endpoint Detection and Response functionality to analyze and respond to threats based on
individual behaviors and techniques proactively.
5. Enable domain and IP-based protections on hosts as well as at network gateways, if possible, to ensure
infrastructure-based coverage is complete.
6. Turn on potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) protection. Many antimalware solutions may label
initial access threats such as adware, torrent downloaders, RATs, and Remote Management Services
(RMS) as PUA. Occasionally, these types of software may be disabled by default to prevent impact to an
environment.
7. Determine where highly privileged accounts are logging on and exposing credentials. Monitor and
investigate logon events for logon type attributes. Highly privileged accounts should not be present on
workstations.
8. Practice the principle of least privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide,

Any domain used in the pursuit of cybercrime can
be considered malicious. Malicious domains can
be legitimate sites which have been compromised

subdomains, or they can be entirely fraudulent
infrastructure set up for the commission of a crime.
Cybercriminals use malicious domains for three
primary functions: information transmission, location
obfuscation, and building resiliency against those
seeking to interfere with their criminal activities.
Domains are used for data exfiltration, controlling
ransomware communication, hosting phishing
pages, and providing control to malware. They
are also used as email domains to create visually
identical imposter email aliases for deception.
Fraudulent domains can use trademarks to deceive
customers or provide a platform for fraud, such as
fraudulent technical support sites.

Adversarial
machine
learning
Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI)
technique that can be used in numerous applications,
including cybersecurity. In responsible ML innovation,
data scientists and developers build, train, and
deploy ML models to understand, protect, and
control data and processes to build trusted solutions.
However, adversaries can attack these ML-driven
systems. The methods underpinning the production
ML systems are systematically vulnerable to a new
class of vulnerabilities across the ML supply chain
collectively known as “adversarial ML.” Adversaries
can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate AI
systems and alter their behavior to serve a malicious
end goal.

that Microsoft and MITRE vetted to be

Adversarial ML Threat Matrix because we believe the
first step in empowering security teams to defend
against attacks on ML systems is to have a framework
that systematically organizes the techniques
employed by malicious adversaries in subverting
ML systems. We hope that the security community
can use the tabulated tactics and techniques to
bolster their monitoring strategies around their
organizations’ mission-critical ML systems.
1. Primary audience is security analysts:
We think that securing ML systems is an
infosec problem. The goal of the Adversarial
ML Threat Matrix is to position attacks on
ML systems in a framework where security
analysts can orient themselves in these new
and upcoming threats. The matrix is structured
like the ATT&CK framework, owing to its

We seeded this framework with a curated set
of vulnerabilities and adversary behaviors
effective against production ML systems,
enabling security analysts to focus on realistic
threats. We also incorporated learnings from
Microsoft’s vast experience in this space into
the framework. For instance, we found that
model stealing is not the end goal of the
attacker but in fact leads to more insidious
model evasion. We also found that when
attacking an ML system, attackers use a
combination of traditional techniques like
phishing and lateral movement alongside
adversarial ML techniques.

Intentional failure modes in ML
Microsoft has incorporated AI- and ML-specific
security practices into its Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL) to protect Microsoft products and
services against these attacks. In addition to threat
detection and mitigation development work and
automation, we have published guidance on steps
customers can take to build defense in depth into
their own AI and ML systems.
The centerpiece of the materials we’ve published is
called Failure Modes in Machine Learning,26 which
lays out the terminology we developed jointly with
the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at
Harvard University. It includes vocabulary that can
be used to describe intentional failures caused by
an adversary attempting to alter results or steal an
algorithm, as well as vocabulary for unintentional
failures such as a system that produces results that
might be unsafe.

wide adoption among the security analyst
community. This way, security analysts have a
familiar framework to learn about threats to
ML systems, which are inherently different from
traditional attacks on corporate networks.

By submitting antivirus software as malware,
an adversary can force its misclassification as
malicious thereby eliminating the use of the
antivirus software on client systems. This could
leave critical infrastructure systems open to
attack.

Membership
Inference

Attacker can infer if a
given data record was part
of the model’s training
dataset or not.

Healthcare information
An adversary could look at a model trained on a
body of data consisting of people with a specific
surgical procedure. By knowing that a particular
individual’s data was in the training set, an
adversary would then know the individual had the
surgical procedure. This privacy violation could
then be leveraged publicly.

Model Stealing

Attacker is able to recover
the model through
carefully crafted queries.

Finance algorithms
Through model queries, an adversary could
reconstruct the potential outputs of the ML
model. This could be used to adversely affect
proprietary algorithms designed for high
frequency stock trading in a particular market.

Attacker evasions
An evasion attack is an exploratory attack against
an ML model to cause an integrity violation. From
a system’s security perspective, it is instructive to
consider black-box evasion attacks, in which an
attacker may have no specific knowledge of the
inner workings of the ML model but instead effects
change by submitting inputs and observing the
corresponding system output. This threat model
is common to many AI systems hosted as a cloud
service or on a consumer device, for example, and is
a concern for models in finance, healthcare, defense,
fraud, and security.

Phishing and other malicious email

Malware

Malicious domains

Sophisticated black-box evasion attacks against
ML models have been demonstrated repeatedly
by white-hat researchers by using algorithms that
iteratively determine what input will cause an
integrity violation. Today, however, threat actors in
the wild may also attempt evasion of ML systems
in some domains, but usually do so through
manual rather than algorithmic means and do not
necessarily focus exclusively on ML as the evasion
target. For example, content moderation filters are
bypassed by mischievous or economically motivated
users by obscuring payload content in creative
ways. Security products that include antimalware or
antiphishing models are evaded by adversaries using
several obfuscation techniques. That these target
systems rely on ML is not necessarily a consideration
in these practical manual evasion attacks.
Whether or not an adversary is present in your
business domain, the risk of adversaries evading
an ML model exists in every domain. An ML model

security research. While in past years there was a
focus on highly visible model evasion attacks where
the fragility of some ML models could be easily
demonstrated, the focus of security researchers
is broadening to include less noticeable attacks.
For example, in data poisoning attacks, the target
is the training data that the ML models are built
from. As new data is aggregated and incorporated
into a dataset for training, it becomes increasingly
important to validate that new training data has not

What we're seeing

Analysis of nation state activity this year

Our approach
Microsoft uses a five-pronged approach to disrupt
nation state actors—providing direct customer
notifications, leveraging technology to detect and
defend, taking technical action against malicious
operations, pursuing legal action, and participating
in public policy discourse—and each one plays an
important role in our commitment to protecting our
customers and the ecosystem at large.
1. Empowering customers
Microsoft leverages its NSN process to inform
customers of targeting or compromise from
nation state actors we track, providing actionable
information for customers to rapidly respond and
protect themselves. Microsoft also provides alerts
to industry sectors and customer segments to help
raise awareness of malicious activity and guidance
on how to respond.

Analysis of nation state activity this year

Compromised versus targeted success rate
Success rates varied widely from threat group to threat group. Some
groups, like North Korean THALLIUM, had a low success rate, because
they used strategies like large-scale spear-phishing campaigns that
rely more on using a wide net than a surgical strike. Password sprays
are another example of a tactic with a low success rate, but where the
attackers understand the success rate will be low. Other groups use very
focused attacks that succeed much more often. HAFNIUM, for example,
succeeded in 43% of its attacks. NICKEL succeeded at an astonishing
rate of over 90%. The figures below represent an average of different
tactics that are designed to succeed at different rates. The first quarter
was extremely high, not necessarily because actors were more successful
that quarter, but because Microsoft noted less activity stemming from
low-success-rate attacks.

Activity origins
The following section depicts the frequency of attacks by country of
origin, measured in the number of NSNs generated from attacks by
each actor. Russia-based threat activity dominated this year, driven
by NOBELIUM’s large-scale targeting. North Korea–based actors also
employed a strategy of ubiquitous targeting that earned North Korea
the second highest percentage of notifications.
Country of activity origin
NOBELIUM, and its aggressive targeting of IT service providers and
Western government institutions, catapulted Russia to the top spot for
countries where attacks originated this year. That group was responsible
for 92% of the notifications to customers about Russia-based threat
activity. The outsized proportion of attacks coming from North Korea is
a result of the strategy taken by threat actors THALLIUM and CERIUM.

Like the “compromised versus targeted” section above, the data in this
section is heavily affected by the tactics chosen by the attackers. If one
group attempts a password spray attack on a hundred targets and
successfully compromises one, while another group surgically focuses
on only one victim that it compromises, they have both had the same
number of successes. However, the first group will appear as the more
“active” group, because it has attacked a hundred targets. The top three
groups in this list all make use of high-fail-rate tactics. NOBELIUM, in
addition to high-success-rate-focused attacks, also makes frequent use
of low-success password sprays, while THALLIUM and PHOSPHORUS
send spear-phishing emails to large groups. This chart, then, does not
necessarily equate to the most dangerous groups, although it does say
something about their relative levels of persistence and ubiquity.

Most active nation state activity groups (July 2020-June 2021)

have a low percentage of success, because of the high number of
attempts, the groups still manage to successfully infect some victims.

What lessons might NOBELIUM have
learned from the SolarWinds incident?
1. The US Government is still not sure where the red lines are for cyber operations.
As a sign of the ongoing debate within US and European policy communities about whether
and how to respond to the SolarWinds breach, in March a former senior adviser to Britain’s
Government Communications Headquarters cautioned the Biden administration not to react
too harshly to Russia’s “surgical” espionage campaign.39 Russian threat actors have exploited
this policy ambiguity for years and could continue to do so for years to come.
2. The private sector is critical to the defense of US government networks.
Microsoft and FireEye were the public face of incident response during the SolarWinds
attack. In the future, NOBELIUM and other groups could move early to handicap highprofile cybersecurity teams, anticipating that doing so will slow the time to identification and

Private sector
offensive actors
A growing industry of companies called private
sector offensive actors (PSOAs) create and sell
malicious cyber technologies that enable their
customers to break into people’s computers, phones,
and internet-connected devices. These private
companies may not be nation state actors, but their
business model presents a dangerous and rapidly
growing challenge for organizations, companies,
and individual consumers. These tools also threaten
many global human rights efforts, as they have been
observed targeting and surveilling dissidents, human
rights defenders, journalists, civil society advocates,
and other private citizens.
In December 2020, Microsoft’s efforts to protect
our customers from the threats presented by this
technology led us to file an amicus brief in support
of WhatsApp’s case against Israel-based NSO
Group Technologies (NSO Group) along with Cisco,
GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, VMware, and Internet
Association.59 The brief encouraged the court to
reject NSO Group’s position that it is not responsible
for the use of its surveillance and espionage
products by governments. Microsoft also worked
with Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto’s Munk
School, to disable malware being used by an Israel-

Microsoft has created and built protections into our

call DevilsTongue.63 By examining how SOURGUM’s
customers were delivering DevilsTongue to victim
computers, we saw they were doing so through a
chain of exploits that impacted popular browsers
and our Windows operating system. We published
details of the malware and 0-day exploits so that
the world can better understand SOURGUM’s
activity and address and mitigate the threat. Private

Comprehensive protections required

required
Nation state actors have demonstrated that they
will go to great lengths to accomplish a mission
to collect information or intelligence. The skill and
persistence of malicious nation state actors increase
the difficulty of detecting and protecting against
advanced threats. Their impact can be wide ranging
and highly damaging. These adversaries are wellfunded, employ techniques of tremendous breadth
and sophistication, and are motivated by objectives
of national significance—which may lead to their
compromising networks for unexpected purposes.
More than other adversaries, nation state attackers
target individuals specifically for access to their
connections, communications, and information. At
the conclusion of an operation, they will assess what
went well and what did not and refine tactics and
techniques for more successful future missions.

Therefore, defense-in-depth strategies against
nation state adversaries should include educating
employees on how to avoid being targeted
themselves. Applying Zero Trust principles across
corporate resources helps more effectively adapt to
the complexity of the modern environment, embrace
the mobile workforce, and protect people, devices,
applications, and data no matter where they are
located or the scale of threats they face.
While nation state attacks are often sophisticated
or can deploy 0-day vulnerabilities to gain access to
networks, defense-in-depth strategies and proactive
monitoring can greatly reduce the actor’s dwell
time on a network, potentially enabling disruption
of their activities before they reach their goals.
Above and beyond enabling foundational basics
like MFA, IT departments should prioritize steps to
mitigate lateral movement by attackers; specifically,
credential hygiene and network segmentation. To

3. Leaders are devoting more resources to supplier security, but recent breaches demonstrated
that traditional models couldn’t guarantee safety.
IT teams are appreciative of the influx of budget and resources following the SolarWinds and Colonial
Pipeline breaches. That appreciation comes with an equal amount of trepidation. Those breaches
demonstrated that the very strategies they are implementing likely would not protect them from a
similar attack, and continuous assessments and push for remediation across tiers of suppliers are
necessary.
4. Greater visibility and unique solutions are top requests to managing suppliers.
Within the four key pillars of digital estates—identities, applications, infrastructure, and devices—
suppliers’ personnel are a top concern. Across that risk hierarchy, organizations are looking for
suppliers to provide:
• Greater visibility into security and who ultimately has access to the organization’s data.
• Customized solutions demonstrating a working knowledge of the industry and the companyspecific needs.

Successful solutions today often depend on the
convergence of many components, including
hardware, software, and cloud services, which often
come together in an IoT solution. IoT is more than
connected devices—it’s about the information
those devices collect and the powerful, immediate
insights that can be garnered from that information.
Accordingly, IoT and other embedded and OTs have
become critical business, operational, and security
topics. More than ever, IoT and OT security is finding
its way into corporate boardrooms and state and
federal legislature discussions as a high-priority
issue, in part due to the increasing frequency and
severity of attacks in the past year. This proliferation
of attacks has also driven increased awareness
of the extent to which cyberattacks in the digital
realm can impact the physical realm: the Colonial
Pipeline cyberattack directly led to shutdown of the

camera provider 72 exposed sensitive footage from
hospitals, police departments, and a plethora of
other companies.
All these developments underscore the need for
organizations to secure their IoT and OT footprints.
Organizations are interconnected more than ever,
resulting in increased exposure of legacy OT devices
and environments, including those that have existed
in relative isolation. On the other hand, the newest
IoT devices (such as smart TVs and smart sensors)
reside in both OT and IT environments. Putting all
of this together, with the added context of privacy
concerns and regulatory compliance, stresses the
need for a holistic approach that enables seamless

frequency and severity in the past year.
From a technical perspective, the Triton attack on

research on various types of equipment ranging
from legacy industrial control system controllers
to cutting-edge IoT sensors. Upon discovery of a
vulnerability, the findings are shared with relevant
vendors through a responsible disclosure process
led by the Microsoft Security Response Center and
the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
enabling these vendors to investigate and patch
the vulnerability.
In April 2021, we uncovered a series of critical
memory allocation vulnerabilities in IoT and OT
devices that adversaries could exploit to bypass
security controls to execute malicious code or cause
a system crash. The group of vulnerabilities was
dubbed BadAlloc. These remote code execution
vulnerabilities affected a wide range of industries
and verticals, from consumer and medical IoT, to
industrial IoT, OT, and industrial control systems.
They covered more than 25 common vulnerabilities
and exposures (CVEs). In the context of IT
environments, an exploitation of such a vulnerability
can result in a loss of confidentiality. In the context
of OT environments, it can be used to trigger a
disruption of operations.
The vulnerabilities stem from using vulnerable
memory functions, such as malloc, calloc, realloc,

Applying Zero Trust to IoT

IoT policy

The following is an example of BadAlloc:

showed that memory allocation implementations

proper input validations. Without these input
validations, an attacker could exploit the memory
allocation function to perform a heap overflow,
resulting in execution of malicious code on a
target device.
The memory allocation vulnerabilities can be
invoked by calling the memory allocation function,
such as malloc(VALUE), with the VALUE parameter
derived dynamically from external input and being
large enough to trigger an integer overflow or
wraparound. The concept is as follows: When
sending this value, the returned outcome is a
freshly allocated memory buffer. While the size
of the allocated memory remains small due to
the wraparound, the payload associated with the
memory allocation exceeds the actual allocated
buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. This heap
overflow enables an attacker to execute malicious
code on the target device.
BadAlloc is a case that illustrates the extensive
impact these vulnerabilities can have because the
risk exists in IoT and OT devices across all major
industries. This example highlights one of the
biggest challenges in mitigating IT, IoT, and OT risks:
they share attack surfaces, and attackers look at the

existing ways of working, but we have started to see more advanced use cases where bots are leveraging new
movement between infected hosts.
Microsoft’s sensor network gives us raw data on these types of attacks and the passwords in use. We looked at
over 280,000 attacks and analyzed the password data we collected. Perhaps unsurprisingly we saw that 96% of
attacks used a password with fewer than 10 characters, 92% had fewer than 8, and slightly more shockingly, 72%
of all attacks required only trying a password of 6 characters or less. Within these password attempts, only 2%
included a special character and 72% didn’t even contain a number.
The attacks we are seeing in the wild line up with the GCA data and other reports. Default passwords, which are
generally a single short English word, make it trivial for an attacker to access an organization’s infrastructure. If
secure identity management with an organization’s IoT devices is not an option, longer passwords—especially
those with special characters—are strongly advised.

BRET ARSENAULT, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER

This past year continued to challenge us in profound ways. While most industries made the shift to remote
work due to the pandemic, it created new attack surfaces for cybercriminals to take advantage of, such as
home devices being used for business purposes. In the first half of 2021, there were three significant assaults:
NOBELIUM (the SolarWinds supply chain attack), HAFNIUM (an on-premises Exchange server attack), and
Colonial Pipeline (a ransomware attack).

approach for
securing hybrid
work
The increasing prevalence of cloud-based services,
mobile computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and
“bring your own device” (BYOD) in hybrid work
environments has changed the technology
landscape for today’s enterprise. Security
architectures that rely on network firewalls and
virtual private networks (VPNs) to isolate and
restrict access to corporate technology resources
and services are no longer sufficient for a workforce
that regularly requires access to applications and
resources that exist beyond traditional corporate
network boundaries. The shift to the internet
as the network of choice and the continuously
evolving threats led Microsoft to adopt a Zero Trust
security model. Zero Trust has become a priority of
enterprise security leaders around the world.
We are facing a moment of reckoning as the world
witnesses a rise in increasingly sophisticated and
expansive cybersecurity attacks. This reality—

Zero Trust adoption
The Zero Trust Adoption Report95 illuminates the
path of Zero Trust adoption across diverse markets
and industries. We hope that the learning gained
by this research can help accelerate your own Zero
Trust strategy adoption, shed light on the collective
progress of your peers, and provide insights on the
future state of this rapidly evolving space.
No single security risk area stands out as a primary
starting point for Zero Trust strategy, as fewer than
15% start with the same security risk area.
Organizations are beginning in different places,
likely based on their needs and available internal
resources. Most organizations approach Zero Trust
as an end-to-end strategy to be completed over
time. Eventually, they seek to adopt this strategy
across all security risk areas to ensure even more
protection against threats.

Strong authentication adoption
For identities, verifying explicitly means ensuring
the identities are using strong authentication when
accessing resources. Microsoft research shows that
requiring strong authentication can protect against
99.9% of the identity attacks because the majority
of the attacks are related to passwords. While
augmenting passwords can help defend against
those attacks, eliminating passwords altogether
with passwordless authentication methods can
provide the most usable and secure authentication
experience.
As companies have been adapting their security
posture for remote work and a hybrid workforce,
we have seen over 220% increase in strong
authentication usage in the last 18 months.

Growth in Zero Trust access policy usage
Azure AD Conditional Access is a security policy engine for verifying explicitly and granting least privilege
access. In the last year, the number of conditional access policies deployed has more than doubled, as
organizations revamped their security postures to account for a remote workforce.
When a user accesses an application, administrators can use conditional access to configure which additional
requirements are enforced to grant access. As organizations embrace Zero Trust security principles, we have
seen greater adoption in managed device and managed app requirements in addition to MFA.

Legacy protocols: A preferred entry point for adversaries
One of the leading sources of compromise in organizations is authentication from legacy protocols, such
as IMAP, SMTP, POP, and MAPI. These protocols do not support MFA, so they are preferred entry points for
adversaries. In fact, 99% of password spray and 97% of credential stuffing attacks use legacy authentication,
according to authentication data from Azure AD. Data from Azure AD reveals that the compromise rate for
authentications using IMAP clients is 22 times higher than the compromise rate for authentications from

Between November 2020 and May 2021, the
average price of a DDoS attack increased over 500%.
The reasons for the price increase are multifaceted:
The rising cost of goods sold for DDoS services
has made them more expensive and resulted in a
decrease in supply relative to demand.
• The price for loads that are turned into DDoS
bots increased as demand for loads for all

supply. (Loads are freshly infected devices

Disinformation refers to the deliberate use of false information with the intention of influencing public opinion.
Efforts to fabricate falsehoods for the purposes of manipulating the masses have a long history. However, new
forms of disinformation have come to the fore over the last decade, enabled by advances in computing methods
and infrastructure that have transformed the power, scope, and efficiency of disinformation campaigns.

THESE

Widely used consumer platforms and services, such as social media, creator platforms, search engines, and messaging
services, now provide state and non-state actors with powerful channels for distributing disinformation. Beyond
channels, these services provide malevolent actors with ready-made tools to experiment, monitor, iterate, and
optimize the impact of disinformation campaigns.

Disinformation
as an emerging
threat
Disinformation has been a steadily evolving method
of information warfare, most recognized in the
United States after the 2016 election, but wellknown globally since the Cold War. This approach
is high-stakes and effective for creating social
discord, increasing polarization, and in some cases,
influencing the outcome of elections. Nation state
actors with geopolitical aspirations, proponents
of radical ideologies, violent extremists, and
economically motivated enterprises can manipulate
online narratives with easy and unprecedented reach
and scale, creating significant societal impact.

The general motive to spread disinformation is
to damage the reputation of an entity, mislead
consumers about the information, or influence
the outcome of a proscribed event. It is one of the
greatest threats to democracy, open debate, and
free and modern society.
Commodity cloud computing, open-source research,
AI tools and algorithms, and the speed and scale of
social media have created a perfect storm for the
rise of disinformation and malicious synthetic media
popularly dubbed deepfakes.110 AI techniques to
create hyper-realistic digital falsification, also known
as deepfakes, include manipulated audio, video,
images, and text, which will seriously challenge
our ability to discern truth from falsehood. In this
report, we use the term “deepfake” as AI-generated
manipulated media used for malicious purposes.

Mapping the problem

A promising step forward on disinformation – Microsoft On the Issues 110 Despite its popular usage, this term technically refers to a specific type of

ML (a process by which exposure to large and diverse amounts of data allows a computer to improve its own performance) that uses layered neural
networks (computer processors connected in a way that mimics how information travels in the human brain) to enhance the accuracy of the ML
algorithms. Deepfakes use two algorithms: the first algorithm creates a video, and the second one tries to determine if the video is real or not. If the
second algorithm can tell that the video is fake, the first algorithm tries again, until the resulting image looks sufficiently believable.

Introduction

Disinformation as an emerging threat

Mitigation through media literary

In the attention economy, websites and platforms
earn revenue from the time users spend on
them. This advertisement-based business model
incentivizes recommendation engines and curated
timelines with clickbait headlines and scandalous
news, opinions, and falsehoods. The timeline
curation algorithms give rise to creating echo
chambers, filter bubbles, and unintentional tribalism.
Because of echo chambers and filter bubbles,
users predominantly see the content that matches
their beliefs, biases, and desires, reinforcing their
confirmation bias and filtering out opposing
viewpoints. Nefarious actors misuse the attention
economy and take advantage of the advertisement
business model to manipulate social media
narratives to create divisions and sow discord.

“Filter bubbles” and “echo chamber”

Disinformation as an enterprise disruptor

Campaign security and election integrity

Parallels in cybersecurity
Cyberattacks compromise the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of digital systems. The
difference between a disinformation attack and
a cyberattack is the target; disinformation is also
an attack and compromise of our cognitive being.
While cyberattacks are exploits of computer
infrastructure to create disruption, disinformation
exploits human infrastructure (our inherent
cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and psychological
vulnerabilities), and the attack compromises logical,
analytical, and critical thinking.
We can therefore think of the threat posed by
disinformation and computational propaganda
as cognitive hacking. A cognitive hack attempts
to change the target audience’s thoughts and
actions using disinformation to manipulate the way
they perceive reality. Nefarious actors accomplish
cognitive hacks utilizing various techniques,
including manipulating, mis-contextualizing, or
misappropriating information. Ultimately, these
hacks can create social discord, exacerbate

polarization, influence election outcomes, disrupt
democratic principles, enable financial fraud, and
threaten life and property.
Both disinformation and cyberattacks are used by an
adversary to achieve disruption. A well-coordinated
disinformation campaign can fill the broadcast
and social channels with false information and
noise, creating narratives that play with emotions
and drown out the true narrative. This maneuver
is similar to a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack that floods the target services and networks
with superfluous requests to connect and overload
the system to prevent legitimate requests from
being fulfilled. Disinformation can also be used
for social engineering threats on a mass scale. Like
phishing attacks to compromise IT systems for
data extraction, disinformation campaigns play on
emotions, giving cybercriminals another feasible
method for scams. Deepfake videos and audio
can trick employees into releasing or sharing login
credentials, which can then be used to gain access

Deepfakes
Deepfakes are photos, videos, or audio files
manipulated by AI in hard-to-detect ways. The
weaponization of deepfakes can have a massive
impact on an economy and national security.
By eroding public trust in the media, deepfakes
undermine the credibility of journalism. As this
credibility is eroded, deepfakes also give rise to the
“Liar’s Dividend” phenomenon. In an environment
where it is unclear what is real and what is fake, it
becomes easier to discount any inconvenient or
unpopular truth as fake. As an example, deepfakes
could enable a public figure to claim that their real
actions are just a fake.
The proliferation of deepfake technology can directly
harm individuals. Deepfake pornography has been
used to objectify and victimize people without
consent, especially women or those who identify
as women. This revenge pornography is now a
significant problem: over 96% of deepfake videos

to an enterprise’s network.

In the attention economy, users are increasingly exposed only to information that matches
their preferences (blue areas in the graphic). Filter bubbles represent algorithms that choose
content based on the user’s previous search histories and other online activity.

Recommendations: Four-point
plan for enterprise executives
As enterprises develop and mature their capabilities
to respond to information disruption and
disinformation, there are new imperatives that are
emerging in the areas of security controls, threat
classification, and analysis. To support and enhance
the enterprise’s ability to improve its response,
prioritize mitigations to address the highest risks,
and to make investments that propel or accelerate
its corporate objectives, the following practices
could be leveraged as a starting point to develop
sustainable mitigations and improvements to
counter the effects of information disruption and
disinformation.
1. Catalog enterprise exposures to disruption,
manipulation, and disinformation.
Enterprises should begin with the arduous task of
cataloging or keeping track of disinformation attacks
on their information systems and data. This catalog
would be an addition to the catalog of threats and
attacks that are part of enterprise security controls.
• Include a classification of information
manipulation and disinformation with clear
indicators of targeted outcomes and impact of
the attacks.
• Note the sources of the attacks or information

2. Assess the impact of manipulation or

An emerging area for enterprise management and
human resources is to conduct impact analyses of
disruption and disinformation. Managers and human
resource departments should study the behavior
of enterprise employees, partners, and customers
as they reacted to disruption or interacted with
disinformation. Security and data science teams
should run A/B tests on AI and trained algorithms to
ensure they have not been corrupted or their models

campaigns sometimes attack or threaten customer
and other protected data, which can have significant
privacy implications for enterprises. Primary sources
or stores of such data are difficult targets as they are
kept deep inside the defensive network of controls,

SMALL TEAMS AND SMALL BUDGETS
In some countries, including the United States,
elections are not managed federally; each
municipality is responsible for running and
managing its own elections infrastructure. The
asymmetric threat of advanced adversaries
targeting local-level elections offices that are time
and resource constrained is of real concern. As
discussed earlier in this report, advanced persistent
threat actors have IT knowledge and monetary
resources that exceed the annual budgets of local
municipalities. Therefore, steps must be taken by
both the private and public sector to concentrate
cybersecurity talent and resources in a way that
helps to offset and balance that asymmetry.
To help elections organizations address these
concerns, the Defending Democracy team focuses
heavily on securing and supporting customers using
cloud services to support their elections, in both the
private and public sectors. Our goal is to use the
cybersecurity expertise at Microsoft to offset the
asymmetric threats faced by local elections or small
elections vendors.

Since launching in October 2019, the program has

Five cybersecurity paradigm shifts

ANN JOHNSON, CVP, SECURITY, COMPLIANCE & IDENTITY

In working with organizations from around the world, we recognize the need to enable people to work
productively and securely and from a variety of non-traditional locations and a variety of devices. Through
these interactions, we’ve learned a lot about the role that cybersecurity plays in helping organizations maintain
business continuity as we adapt to a hybrid work world. As a result, we anticipate five cybersecurity paradigm
shifts that will support the evolution of work in a way that centers on the inclusivity of people and data.

Summary of
report learnings
What became clear as we compiled this report is
how much technology is now baked into everything
we do. We can’t afford to treat technology and cyber
risk as something separate and contained that IT
and security teams are left to manage on their own.
The examples in this report show that criminals will
seek to exploit whatever technology we develop
and introduce; the challenge is in understanding
what form that will take. Because we can’t always
predict how technology will be exploited, we need
to assume that anything we create or use will be
a potential target and prepare ourselves to be as
resilient as possible.
The key actionable learning from all the elements
of this report is that to minimize impact of attacks
we must truly practice good cyber hygiene,
implement architectures that support the principles
of Zero Trust, and ensure cyber risk management is
integrated into every aspect of the business.
The following section summarizes some of the key
learnings reinforced by the findings and insights in
the report.

Conclusion

Cyber hygiene
Taking basic security precautions can help
your organization prepare for and mitigate the
overwhelming majority of modern cyber threats
and helps to prepare for the evolution of threats
as technology advances. The “cybersecurity bell
curve” shows the activities that will have the biggest
impact on reducing threats. Some of those actions,
the impact they have, and recommendations for
implementing them are described here.
Enable multifactor authentication
This continues to be the top recommendation as it
was last year. MFA can stop credential-based attacks
dead in their tracks. Without access to the additional
factor, the attacker can’t access the account or
protected resource. The introduction of passwordless
technology and architectures makes this easier for
employees and customers to use and also provides
more security than traditional text (SMS) or voice
approaches. MFA should be enabled on all accounts
that support it, in a way that it is easy for all users
to use it. It’s also important to ensure that people
understand that they should not approve an MFA
request unless they were trying to log in or access a
system—many people automatically click to approve
any pop-up that they receive. Digital empathy can
be useful in understanding this behavior and helping
to nudge people toward less risky decisions.
