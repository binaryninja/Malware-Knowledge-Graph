Introduction
Online banking is now a run-of-the-mill affair for most. More and more banks are trying to
maximize the range of services available to clients online. With the added convenience and
speed, it might seem as though there is no downside to online banking. However, where
there is money — in any form — there are usually scammers.
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the first attacks against online banking customers were
launched — and in this case, it’s not all that important. We have encountered two types of
attacks: attacks that use classic phishing methods, and attacks that employ a variety of
malicious programs. Initially, these attacks were meant to identify online banking system
users — i.e. to harvest usernames and passwords. As banks improved their security
mechanisms, cyber criminals responded by improving malicious programs and learned how
to bypass most of the transaction confirmation processes used in online banking systems.

These days, the most popular security features of online banking services are TAN codes
(Transaction Authentication Number) with digital signatures. In some cases, banks send TAN
codes via a text message (these are called mTANs, or mobile transaction authentication
numbers). Prior to September 2010, there were no recorded instances of attacks using
mTAN codes. In 2009, rumors went around that hackers were buying up Nokia 1100s in bulk
for tens of thousands of dollars — not just any 1100s, but specifically ones that were
manufactured at a factory in Bochum, Germany. Allegedly, these particular handsets had
special features (or vulnerabilities?) that made it possible to intercept all text messages,
including those containing mTAN codes. However, no such cases were ever confirmed.
When the ZeuS Trojan for mobile platforms (aka ZeuS-in-the-Mobile, or ZitMo) came out in
late September 2010, it became the first malicious program designed to steal mTAN codes.
This article will discuss ZitMo in detail.

ZitMo’s plan of attack
Mobile ZeuS, or Trojan-Spy.*.Zitmo, was designed for one sole purpose: to quickly steal
mTAN codes without mobile users noticing. The first important thing to point out is that ZitMo
works in close collaboration with the regular ZeuS Trojan. By the regular ZeuS we will mean
a modification of the Trojan that targets the Win32 platform and which is classified as TrojanSpy.Win32.Zbot by Kaspersky Lab.
Readers may recall that ZeuS for PCs running on Windows has been around for some time
now. Its first modifications appeared back in 2007. Check out Dmitri Tarakanov’s article for
more about ZeuS.
What happens when a user whose computer is infected with ZeuS gets ready to log in to an
online banking system? The user attempts to navigate to his bank’s webpage and log into
the system. The PC version of ZeuS registers that the victim is going to an address of
interest, and modifies this webpage in the browser so that the personal data entered by the
user for authentication is not sent to the bank, but to the ZeuS botnet command center.

How ZeuS works

Sometime in September 2010, malicious users added a new function to the PC-based ZeuS.
The way it worked remained more or less the same, only now a modified authentication page
would also ask the user to enter data about their mobile device (the make, model, and

2/12

telephone number) in addition to their username and password. Users were told that the data
was requested for the alleged purpose of certificate updates.

Sooner or later, users who provided information to malicious users about their cell phones
would receive a text messages asking them to install a new security certificate. This “security
certificate” could be downloaded via a link that was provided in the text message. However,
this “certificate” was in fact the mobile version of the ZeuS Trojan. If the user followed the
link, downloaded and installed the application, then his mobile phone would be infected by
ZitMo, the primary function of which is to send a text message to a malicious user’s phone as
specified in the body of the Trojan.
ZitMo is still spread in the same way: users download it to their mobile devices under the
assumption that it is legitimate software.
The malicious users who successfully used the PC-based ZeuS to steal personal user data
for online banking systems and infect victims’ phones with ZitMo were thus able to overcome
the last barrier of online banking security systems: the mTAN code. By entering a user’s login
and password, they were able to access their bank accounts and conduct transactions (such
as transferring money from the user’s account to their own bank accounts). These
transactions required additional authentication using a code sent by the bank via text
message to the client’s phone. After the client submitted a transaction request, the bank
would send the client an authentication code. The code would be sent to the ZitMo-infected
handset, which immediately forwarded it to the malicious user’s number, who would then use
the stolen mTAN to authenticate the transaction. And the victim would be none the wiser.
The attacks are generally orchestrated as follows:

3/12

1. Cyber criminals use the PC-based ZeuS to steal the data needed to access online
banking accounts and client cell phone numbers.
2. The victim’s mobile phone (see point 1) receives a text message with a request to
install an updated security certificate, or some other necessary software. However, the
link in the text message will actually lead to the mobile version of ZeuS.
3. If the victim installs this software and infects the phone, the malicious user can then
use the stolen personal data and attempt to make cash transactions from the
compromised account, but still needs an mTAN code to authenticate the transaction.
4. The bank sends out a text message with the mTAN code to the client’s mobile phone.
5. ZitMo forwards the text message with the mTAN code to the malicious user’s phone.
6. The malicious user is then able to use the mTAN code to authenticate the transaction.

Known attacks
ZitMo’s was first detected on September 25, 2010. At that time, the Spanish-based data
security company S21sec had written about this threat (see:
http://securityblog.s21sec.com/2010/09/zeus-mitmo-man-in-mobile-i.html). However, it was
not clear which banks were targeted. All of the data available leads us to believe that the
victims were clients of one Spanish bank.
After that article was published, antivirus companies began their own research. S21sec
reported it had detected ZitMo on two different mobile platforms: Symbian and BlackBerry.
Examples of the malicious program for Symbian were quickly found, but for a long time the
mobile version of ZeuS for BlackBerry existed only in theory and on paper as no one was
able to get their hands on a sample.
A Polish blogger wrote about the second ZitMo attack on 21 February 2011 (see:
http://niebezpiecznik.pl/post/zeus-straszy-polskie-banki/) and the names of the banks whose
clients were being targeted finally came to light: ING and mBank.

The list of targeted platforms also grew, and now included smartphones running on Windows
Mobile.
At that point, only the ZitMo attacks described above had been detected. It remains unclear
whether other attacks had taken place. If so, then they will probably not be discussed in
public.

Platforms
At the time of this article’s publication (October 2011), various modifications of ZitMo had
been detected for the following platforms: Symbian, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry and
Android.
Above, we described the general sequence of events that occur during attacks and the main
objective of the mobile version of ZeuS, i.e. to obtain text messages with mTAN codes. The
functions for ZitMo versions targeting different platforms (save for Android) are identical,
although it’s still important to take a closer look at the individual versions for each mobile
platform.

5/12

For starters, let us take a look at one crucial and interesting detail of all ZitMo versions, with
the exception of Android. A Trojan running on a smartphone is controlled by commands that
are received via text message. So essentially, ZitMo is a text-bot, the C&C of which is
another telephone, or to be more precise, a telephone number.
By July 2011, the following C&C numbers had been identified:
+44778148****
+44778148****
+44778148****
+44778620****
+44778148****
These are all UK numbers. Is this indirect evidence that the authors of the malicious program
were located in the UK during the attack? It’s possible.

Symbian
The ZitMo version for Symbian was the first sample of this threat obtained by antivirus
companies (in late September 2010). Another point worth mentioning is that this malicious
program was given a legitimate digital signature (which has since been recalled).

So how does ZitMo for Symbian operate?
Immediately after a smartphone is infected, the Trojan sends the text message ‘App installed
OK’ to the C&C number, thus notifying the malicious users that the program has been
installed and is ready to accept commands. ZitMo then creates a database named
NumbersDB.db with three tables: tbl_contact, tbl_phone, and tbl_history.
After infection, ZitMo can receive text messages from the C&C number with the following
commands:
ADD SENDER
REM SENDER
SET SENDER
6/12

SET ADMIN
BLOCK ON or OFF
ON or OFF
The ADD SENDER command is one of the most critical for ZitMo, since it orders the
forwarding of text messages from specified telephone numbers (the numbers which banks
use to send mTAN codes via text message) to the C&C number. In other words, this
command activates the forwarding of text messages with authentication codes for
transactions executed by malicious users.
The REM SENDER command ends the forwarding of text messages from the number
specified in the command to the C&C number.
The SET SENDER command allows the malicious users to update the telephone number
from which the text messages are forwarded to the C&C.
The SET ADMIN command lets malicious users change the C&C number. This is the only
command that can be sent to an infected mobile device from a telephone number other than
the C&C number, enabling malicious users to change the command center.
The BLOCK ON/BLOCK OFF commands allow malicious users to block or unblock all
incoming and outgoing calls.
The ON/OFF command allows the malicious users to switch ZitMo on and off.
ZitMo does not contain any “personal” commands and is designed with one goal in mind: to
transfer text messages with mTAN codes.
The second version of ZitMo, detected in a second identified attack, was slightly different
from the first, but only negligibly. First of all, what is clear is that the C&C number was
different. However, the country code (UK) in this number remained the same. Second, ZitMo
began to scan both incoming and outgoing text messages, which is a bit strange, since the
primary objective of the Trojan is to harvest mTAN codes. The third difference is that ‘App
installed OK’ text messages were sent every time a SET ADMIN command was successfully
received and executed. Previously these messages were only sent after a Trojan was
installed.

Windows Mobile
ZitMo for Windows Mobile was detected during the Trojan’s second known attack, which also
involved the Symbian version. It comes as no surprise that the C&C number for both the
Windows Mobile and Symbian versions of the threat was the same.

There are no differences in the functions between the Windows Mobile and Symbian
versions of ZitMo. The Trojan is capable of receiving and executing the same commands on
both platforms.

BlackBerry
The BlackBerry version of ZitMo turned out to be quite complex and a bit of a mystery. The
threat was first identified in the same blog which announced the first confirmed appearance
of ZitMo. But after five months of research, antivirus companies could not detect any files
associated with ZitMo for BlackBerry and some people began to speculate that there was, in

8/12

fact, no active BlackBerry version of ZitMo. Kaspersky Lab finally detected the file
sertificate.cod shortly after the second ZitMo attack in late February 2011, which turned out
to be the elusive ZueS-in-the-Mobile for BlackBerry.

A quick glance at the file shows that in terms of the commands for this ZitMo version, there
are no major differences from the other versions. A more detailed analysis brought the
following to light.
The main methods used by this Trojan are stored in the file OptionDB.java. Among the
names of the methods, one can find getAdminNumber, which is used, among other things, in
the following Trojan installation confirmation process:

Logical methods can be found, such as isForwardSms, which determines whether or not a
text message will be forwarded, and isBlockAllCalls determines whether or not telephone
calls will be blocked.
The main processes required by this program’s operations can be found in the file
SmsListener.java. These include, for example, a number verification process to identify the
senders of incoming text messages that then determines which messages should be
forwarded to the malicious users.

Android
ZitMo for Android was detected last of all, in early July 2011. The sample that was found is
very different from all previous ZeuS-in-the-Mobile versions. The threat’s functions are so
primitive that it might seem as though the APK file is entirely unconnected to ZitMol.
However, research confirmed that it really is ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.

9/12

We have written about how ZeuS operates. In brief, when a user attempts to visit his bank’s
website and log in, he will instead see a page that has been modified by ZeuS asking him to
enter data which is then sent to a malicious user’s server, not the bank.
The first attacks using ZitMo for Android began in the first two weeks of June. The tactics
used to spread the threat were the same. The following message was found in one of the
configuration files of Trojan-Spy.Win32.Zbot:

ZeuS’s “welcome message”

Once a user selects “Android” and clicks “Continue”, he is led to the following page, where
he is “strongly recommended” to download “a special software which will help to protect you
from fraud”.

If a user selects an OS other than Android, then nothing will happen. The user will see the
following message.

The message for non-Android users stating that no “additional protection” is required

In other words, this specific version of ZitMo targets the Android platform exclusively.
After downloading and installing the allegedly legitimate software, the user will receive the
malicious program on his smartphone, the only purpose of which is to forward all incoming
text messages (including those with mTAN codes) to a remote server
(http://******rifty.com/security.jsp) in the following format:

11/12

f0={SMS_sender_number}&b0={SMS_text}&pid={infected_device_ID}
There are no other additional functions — not even any C&C numbers or text message
commands in ZitMo for Android! However, ZitMo for Android still definitely has a connection
to the PC-based ZeuS.
Also of note: the malicious program has been on the Android Market for some time now. It
was uploaded there on 18 June, although the date it was removed is not clear. It was
downloaded from Android Market less than 50 times.

What next?
The ZitMo Trojan, which works in collaboration with the PC-based ZeuS Trojan, is perhaps
one of the most complex recent mobile threats for the following reasons:
It is a Trojan with a very narrow specialization: forwarding incoming text messages with
mTAN codes to malicious users (or a server, in cases involving ZitMo for Android) so
that the latter can execute financial transactions using hacked bank accounts.
There are versions for multiple mobile platforms. ZitMo versions for Symbian, Windows
Mobile, BlackBerry, and Android have been detected.
It works with ZeuS as a “team”. If you look at ZitMo separately, i.e. without any
connection to the PC-based ZeuS, then it becomes mere spyware capable of
forwarding text messages. However, if used in combination with the classic PC-based
ZeuS, then malicious users will be able to clear the final hurdle of online banking
authentication processes using stolen mTAN codes.
In the future, attacks involving ZitMo (or a malicious program with similar functions) that are
designed to somehow steal mTAN codes (or perhaps other confidential information that is
sent via text message) will continue, although it is likely that they will become more
specifically targeted against a smaller number of victims.
