A Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware

Foreword
WMI Overview

Malicious scenarios

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
[1] is the infrastructure for management data and
operations on Windows-based operating systems.
WMI is the Microsoft implementation of Web-Based
Enterprise Management (WBEM). WMI uses the
Common Information Model (CIM) industry standard
to represent systems, applications, networks, devices
and other managed components.

The earliest mainstream use of WMI was Stuxnet, a
piece of malware that completely reshaped cybersecurity. As a result, today’s malware increasingly
abuses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).
Stuxnet, one of the most sophisticated worms
of 2010, affected nuclear processing facilities in
Natanz, Iran and used WMI to enumerate users and
spread to available network shares. It also used
MOF (Managed Object Format) files, the means for
creating and registering providers and events for
WMI. In other words, it (ab)used the WMI - Technique
T1084, Windows Management Instrumentation Event
Subscription, for Persistence, Technique T1087,
Account Discovery, and Technique T1135, Network
Share Discovery, for Discovery and Technique T1105,
Remote File Copy, for Lateral Movement.

WMI, which can be used in all Windows-based
applications, is designed to work with C/C++, VBA
or any scripting language that has an engine on
Windows and can handle ActiveX objects. Many
Windows features have associated WMI providers,
they implement the functionality described by
WMI classes, methods and properties to manage
associated Windows features. A management
application communicates with WMI by using a variety
of interfaces, all based on the Component Object
Model (COM).
Main WMI classes:
•

WMI System Classes - predefined classes included
in every namespace in the WMI core, they provide
much of the basic functionality and are similar in
purpose to the system tables in SQL server;

•

MSFT Classes - offer means to manipulate
OS features, such as remote events and policy
extensions;

•

CIM Classes - common information model (CIM)
schema classes, you can inherit from these
classes. Win32 classes inherit from CIM classes;

•

Standard Consumer Classes - set of WMI event
consumers that trigger an action upon receipt of an
arbitrary event.

This article details a collection of malware that
use WMI to achieve their goal. This compilation
aims to inform security practitioners and decisionmakers about current malicious techniques, each
in correspondence with the tactics from the MITRE
Att&ck Matrix[2], and remind our partners of the
importance of proper WMI monitoring in combating
cyber attacks.
Direct or indirect use of the Management
Instrumentation may be involved in the following
tactics, each in correspondence with relevant
techniques:

Execution
•

Technique T1047, the Windows Management
Instrumentation technique;

•

Technique T1559.001, Inter-Process
Communication: Component Object Model.
Interacting with WMI is done through COM;

•

Technique T1059.001, Command and Scripting
Interpreter: PowerShell. For instance, by using the
Get-WmiObject cmdlet to get instances of WMI
classes;

•

Technique T1021.006, Remote Services: Windows
Remote Management. WMI supplies management
data for WinRM;

•

Technique T1083, File and Directory Discovery. The Win32_Directory WMI class can manipulate a directory. The
CIM_DataFile WMI class represents a named collection of data. The Win32_ShortcutFile WMI class repesents
shortcut files;

•

Technique T1135, Network Share Discovery. The Win32_Share WMI class repesents a shared resource;

•

Technique T1120, Peripheral Device Discovery. There are a lot of useful WMI classes, such as: Win32_CDROMDrive,
Win32_DesktopMonitor, Win32_InfraredDevice, Win32_Keyboard, Win32_Printer, Win32_SerialPort, Win32_USBController,
Win32_VideoControlleretc;

•

•

Technique T1105, Ingress Tool Transfer. Can be achieved using the Win32_Share WMI class;

Command and Control
•

Technique T1571, Non-Standard Port. WMI calls uses port 135 and then chooses a random port;

•

Technique T1219, Remote Access Software. ManagementScope.Connect method connects the scope object to a
WMI namespace on a remote computer;

Exfiltration
•

Technique T1041, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Exfiltration can be achieved using the ManagementScope object
connected to a namespace on a remote computer.

Due to the complexity of the Windows Management Instrumentation, this list is not exhaustive. WMI abuse can be
executed in creative ways in other tactics and techniques. However, we hope the enumeration of the above techniques,
through their multitude and variety, inspires the implementation and improvement of detection mechanisms regarding
the WMI. As a complement to those mentioned above, we want to present examples of malware currently in the wild
and how they abuse the WMI using some of the techniques stated above to achieve their goal.

Technical Analysis. Malware Collection
Kingminer
A piece of crypto-jacking malware that has been around since 2018, Kingminer continues to evolve, as cyber criminals
can still monetize infections in enterprise environments. Some of the malicious techniques adopted by the improved
Kingminer include initial access from SQL Server by brute-force, execution from kernel exploits similar to the WannaCry
campaign, as well as Domain Generation Algorithm for evading blacklists, and fileless execution.
This crypto-jacking malware abuses the Windows Management Instrumentation to check if specific Windows Updates
are installed on the system and it disables Remote Desktop access to the infected machines.
In the Execution stage, it abuses the WMI Event Subscription mechanism: one part of the malicious script registers an
active script consumer to execute periodically. The WMI event consumer ensures persistence by using the T1546.003,
Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription.
For a complete malware analysis and representative malicious code, we recommend that you further read Kingminer
Botnet Keeps up with the Times[3].

Maze Ransomware
At the end of May 2019, a new family of ransomware called Maze was grabbing headlines, filling the void left by the
now-dismantled GandCrab ransomware. Maze authors implemented an exfiltration mechanism to leverage payment
and transform an operational issue into a data breach. Using the WMI, Maze manages to destroy any existing Windows
backups, such as the Volume Shadow Copies.
By querying the Win32_ShadowCopy WMI class, it finds the shadows to be deleted in the next phase, also known as
Technique T1490, Inhibit System Recovery.
To better understand Maze ransomware with code examples, we recommend that you take a look at A Malware
Researcher’s Guide to Reversing Maze Ransomware[4].

Emotet
Emotet, also known as Geodo or Mealybug, was first detected in 2014 and has remained active ever since. The first
versions functioned as a banking Trojan used to capture banking credentials from victims. Several years later, the
malware evolved from a banking-oriented threat to a more generic loader: it gains access to a system and then allows
the attackers to drop additional payloads. The second payload may be an executable or a script.
Nowadays, the most common entry vector for Emotet is via spearphishing email attachments, also known as
Technique T1566.001, Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment. The email usually has a .doc file attached. To persuade the
user to execute the malicious VBA, attackers rely on social engineering. Emotet is often the root cause not only for
banking attacks, but for cryptocurrency miner and ransomware purposes as well.
In terms of tactics and techniques, recent versions often use Windows Management Instrumentation. We chose to
present Emotet in this article because of its wide distribution in order to show how it goes undetected by relying on
techniques that involve WMI. By using mainly Technique T1202, Indirect Command Execution, with the Win32_Process
WMI class, instead of simply spawning PowerShell directly, sometimes it flies under the radar.
To configure the startup configuration for the process, it uses also the Win32_ProcessStartup abstract WMI class.

A Technical Analysis of Emotet

We managed to capture one of the infection sources and, looking more closely at the document, we concluded that
it relies on VBA event procedures. When the file is opened (if macros are enabled), an event that calls the Document_
Open() procedure is triggered.
As an obfuscation technique, the attackers included pieces of code similar to the one below in all stored procedures,
which, in fact, have no effect.

The code presented next is stripped of the obfuscation blocks mentioned above to make it more readable.
Document_Open() calls Rorsxwhelbf() from Zgwsfixtdhep.

The PowerShell command line is stored using the Yujnbbunz form and decoded using the same mechanism by
removing “}{“.

Using WMI, Emotet manages to break the Process Tree, and often avoid detection if the WMI is not properly monitored.

sLoad
sLoad is a PowerShell downloader that includes noteworthy WMI reconnaissance features. Researchers at Microsoft
found version 2.0.1[5], while Bitdefender isolated the improved version 2.7.3, Age of Ultron Edition. How can such
concrete data as the version and the edition be presented? In this case, the attackers were generous enough to include
them right at the beginning of the malicious script.

When talking about sLoad, some researchers often refer to how it uses BITS to filter data. This time, we want
to give credit for the way it abuses the WMI. In the reconnaissance step, sLoad obtains information about the
system, Technique T1082, System Information Discovery, through the WMI classes Win32_Processor and Win32_
OperatingSystem. It also looks for possible shares with the Win32_LogicalDisc class.

sLoad Technical Analysis
The entry point for this analysis is a PowerShell script with a random name - in our case JWVrjYXZ.ps1. It is based on
several try-except blocks that knowingly generate exceptions.
The malware reaches the machine in the same way as that presented by the Microsoft Defender ATP Research Team,
via email with ZIP attachment.
The randomly named script is responsible for decoding the ‘system.ini’ file found in the same directory, and executing it
in memory, without touching the disk.
Microsoft team calls the 2.0.1 version “Starslord” based on the variable found in $starsLord = Split-Path -parent -resolve
$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path; So, I guess we could call version 2.7.3 Sokovia, based on $Sokovia = Split-Path -parent
-resolve $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path; but we will refer it more generally as sLoad.
It references the copy of BITS Admin tool as $Ultron

For each C&C address, $InfinityStones represents a random eight-character string, for the BITS transfer job name.
$Wanda points to the full command needed to download the additional files as a <index>_<random selected running
procees name>.log
The URL translates to “<C&C>/main.php?ch=1&i=<the calculated md5 for the MAC address and the ComputerName
concatenated”

If at least one file is successfully downloaded, it will be marked with the $ad flag, and the content would be saved as
the $cryptoKey

If no file is successfully downloaded, the C&C are re-encrypted with a counter appended to the domain name. For
example: hxxps[:]//nbrwer2[.]eu/topic/ and hxxps[:]//joodfbnm2[.]eu/topic/, and it exits, killing PowerShell.

On success, it looks for shares using WMI class Win32_LogicalDisk

Using WMI class Win32_processor, $Yoda becomes the cpu name. Using Win32_OperatingSystem, the caption is also
saved.

Get a specific list of running processes, by exclusion, creating the $Pietro list

Using BITS admin via URL parameters, it sends data captured to the attacker in base64 encoding.

In this case, it actually exfiltrates information using a Download BITS job, with the information passed as URL
parameters.
If the exfiltration fails, it exits killing PowerShell. If it fails, there are three supported commands, as follows: eval, iex and
run, with the same capabilities described by the Microsoft team:
•

eval - run PowerShell scripts;

•

iex - load and invoke PowerShell code;

•

run - run executables.

Miner Downloader
Another relevant example is a miner downloader that uses the StdRegProv WMI class to manipulate the registry to
disable protection mechanisms, which falls into Technique T1112, Modify Registry. To check for internet connectivity at
the start of execution, the downloader uses the Win32_PingStatus class to ping well-known sites. The miner’s command
line allows to specify the IP address to connect to, and in more than a few cases, it connects to a legitimate German
infrastructure.

Miner Downloader Technical Analysis
At first, it tries to create a task with the following command, running at startup as SYSTEM, the highest privilege level. If
not enough privileges can be obtained, it fails.

This means that, to maintain persistence, it needs enough privileges, otherwise it just starts the additional payload
once (more on this below).
It then creates firewall rules so that it adds exception to one of the cscript.exe/ wscript.exe programs.

BD37D891CD1C4ABD9C8C781 is “WindowsIndexCoreUpdate” and BFE path to cscript/ wscript
Using winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=Impersonate}!\\.\root\CIMV2:Win32_PingStatus.Address= pings well known
websites, exits on the first success

Using “winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\.\root\default:StdRegProv” modifies the Registry to add exclusion
for %TEMP% path and to disable Windows Defender components

E16 is &H80000002 and stands for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Tries to retrieve the next stage from the following URLs: “hxxp[:]//gmfordown[.]com/game[.]log”, “hxxp[:]//tor4games[.]
com/steam[.]lock” or “hxxp[:]//dvx2videofr[.]com/pack[.]dll” and save it as %TMP%\\steam.vbe. If it succeeds, it runs
the script. If it fails, it exits.

Every time it starts, it changes the names of variables and functions, deletes itself and drops the modified version in
%AppData%//<random_from_guid>//<random_from_guid>.vbs. The random directory is hidden.
If the file is a .VBE script, the copy is .VBE too. It decodes it in memory, makes the changes and then encodes it again.

Conclusion
The Windows Management Instrumentation offers a plethora of benefits to administrators, but also offers many
advantages to malicious actors. Given that WMI allows the orchestration of fileless attacks, we see increased focus
on these techniques in the wild. In terms of both legitimate and malicious use, WMI offers the flexibility to obtain
information about systems, to configure settings even for remote computers and applications, to schedule processes
to run at specific times, to enable and disable logging and to obtain code execution.
These features make it an ideal component for malicious actors when it comes to Discovery in particular, but, as
shown above, it has strong implications in Execution, Persistence, Lateral Movement, Command and Control, and
Exfiltration. Being an atypical, indirect method, it is easily understood that the actions performed through WMI can also
be found in the Defense Evasion tactic.

Bitdefender Whitepaper
A Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware

The crypto-jacking Kingminer has continued to evolve since its debut in 2018, with the current version using the
notorious Technique T1546.003, Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription.
Even more, WMI is present in more subtle places, used to check if specific Windows Updates are installed, and to
block Remote Desktop access on infected machines. When it comes to ransomware, the Windows Management
Instrumentation can also play an important role. As an example, we chose to present Maze, where Windows backups
are destroyed with the help of WMI. Shifting our attention towards the realm of Bankers, we can identify the use of WMI
in the current versions of the well-known Emotet. Thanks to Technique T1202, Indirect Command Execution, it manages
to evade detection from some security products. The PowerShell downloader, sLoad, is often mentioned for abusing
BITS, but we have come to the conclusion that it’s not the only ace up its sleeve.
SLoad can use some WMI classes in the Discovery step, classes such as Win32_Processor, Win32_OperatingSystem and
Win32_LogicalDisc to obtain system information. We chose to complete the list of examples with a miner downloader,
in which the registry is manipulated through WMI to disable protection mechanisms, Technique T1112, Modify Registry.
In addition, it ensures its internet connectivity through the Win32_PingStatus class, pinging well-known websites.
While WMI abuse has been going on for nearly a decade, it continues to evolve. Today it can take place in multiple
creative scenarios, affecting a significant number of techniques. From Stuxnet onwards, modern malware incorporates
evasion techniques based on WMI, and unfortunately these small pieces can make the difference between a stopped
attack and total compromise.
