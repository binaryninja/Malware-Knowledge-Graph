1.Backgroud
Recently, 360 Security Center discovered that a malicious driver “Netfilter rootkit” with WHQL
signature was revealed in mid-June. WHQL signature means that after the hardware driver
passed the Microsoft certification, Microsoft will add a “Hardware Compatibility Publisher”
digital signature to the driver. The Netfilter rootkit has now been updated to the second
generation and continues to hold the Microsoft signature. Moreover, the concealment of the
upgraded Netfilter rootkit has increased so much that there is still no antivirus report on
Virustotal.
In view of the fact that the second generation of Netfilter rootkit differs from the previous
version in function and name, 360 Security Center named it “NetRedirect rootkit”. Although
the NetRedirect rootkit has strong concealment and hazards, 360 Total Security can still
achieve targeted defense and thorough investigation and killing, and fundamentally solve the
user’s security problems.

In fact, as early as June 25, the Microsoft Security Response Center stated that it had
suspended the Netfilter rootkit account and reviewed other documents issued by it.
“According to our zero-trust and layered defense security posture, we passed Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint Built-in detection and blocking of this driver and related files.”
However, its second-generation product, the NetRedirect rootkit, which is highly homologous
and similar in behavior, still has a Microsoft signature, making it more concealed and difficult
to detect and kill.
In addition, the harmfulness of NetRedirect rootkit has also been significantly improved. In
view of the way that NetRedirect rootkit cloud controls the distribution of rootkits, the current
malicious vendor is fully capable of not only being limited to the IP hijacking function, but also

being able to implement any malicious rootkit execution on the infected devices.
1. The hidden behavior of cloud-controlled malicious files and memory loading
Different from the previous generation of “Netfilter rootkit” verifying its own file md5 to
implement file self-update, “NetRedirect rootkit” adopts the form of disguising the driver and
the malicious driver, and the real malicious driver is stored on the Trojan C & C server in a
cloud-controlled manner, And the local masquerading as the driver of the WFP network
filtering function is responsible for requesting malicious file data from the server, and calling
the rootkit entry address in a concealed manner of memory loading.

The source of the “NetRedirect rootkit” is certain private server games. After the private
server game runs, it will silently write to the driver registry service, release the
NetRedirect.sys file to the %UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming directory, and load

NetRedirect.sys .

Subsequently, NetRedirect.sys, which has Microsoft’s signature, will request the real
malicious driver from the server in the form of a socket:

After obtaining the rootkit file data, the memory is self-loaded and the driver entry address is
called:

The Netfilter rootkit loaded in the memory is responsible for IP hijacking. It will repeatedly
tamper with the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings\AutoConfigURL key value item, and finally achieve the purpose of IP hijacking:

The partial hijacking list is as follows:

It is monitored that the “NetRedirect rootkit” does not belong to any module’s memory thread,
and tampering with the registry AutoConfigURL key value:

However, users do not need to worry. Under the protection of 360 Total Security’s accuracy,
real-time and intelligence, such rootkits cannot bypass 360 Total Security’s behavior-based
detection. The new generation of defense technology empowered by 360 Security Center
can prevent problems before they happen. , It can also carry out thorough investigation and
killing of infected devices.
