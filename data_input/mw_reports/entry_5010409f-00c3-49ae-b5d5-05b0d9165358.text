The 'Spy Cloud' Operation: Geumseong121 group
carries out the APT attack disguising the evidence
of North Korean defection

The Background of 'Operation Spy Cloud' APT Campaign

ESRC (ESTsecurity Security Response Center) researchers identified the new APT campaign
carried out by the state-sponsored group named 'Geumseong121' in early March 2020.
'Geumseong121', a North Korean threat group has been conducting the state-sponsored
espionage activities in the cyberspace of South Korea for years, mainly targeting those who

are engaged in unification, foreign affairs, or national security, the leaders of the organizations
specializing in North Korean issues, and North Korean refugees.
ESRC analyzed the recently discovered campaign based on Indicators of compromise (IoC)
data and pieces of evidence collected by threat intelligence multi-channel sensors including
the ESTsecurity’s security solution ALYac.
The report titled “The stealthy mobile APT attack carried out by Geumseong121 APT hacking
group” published in November last year, reveals that the group has attempted to perform
cyber-attacks targeting a wide range of devices including computers as well as mobile devices.
In particular, the group infiltrated an unspecified website and exploited it as a command
control (C2) server in the 'Operation Dragon Messenger' campaign. Also, we observe the
evolution of the attack strategies in the web servers, which have been built by the group using
its design, for use in the newly discovered attack.
Moreover, the use of trust-based attack tactics such as Google Play Store or YouTube is
distinguished from the existing attack strategies that have been used by most threat actors.
The APT campaign used the advanced spear-phishing techniques with the bait file containing
evidence of North Korean defectors to trick email recipients into believing they received an
email from a trusted source.
ESRC named the Geumseong 121 group’s APT campaign as 'Operation Spy Cloud' based on
the use of Google Drive and PickCloud service.

APT attack vector: spear phishing tactics and processes

The group of attackers behind the 'Operation Spy Cloud' make full use of and derive benefit
from a spear-phishing technique that enables the direct and stealthy access to the attack
targets.

The spear-phishing email used in the attack contains a malicious link, which tricks users to click
to download the file attaching the malicious MS Word DOC document.
Based on the samples we collected, the campaign's decoy documents used the file formats
DOC, XLS, and HWP, the Korean government standard word processor format, targeting the
users in South Korea.

[Figure 1] Attack flow of 'Operation Spy Cloud'

The attacker attempted to distribute the file by using a URL link instead of attaching the file
considering that a security solution could capture emails where a malware threat is detected in
an attachment and block the email before delivery. This allows attackers to modify or delete
files as needed, to evade detection and minimize the footprint.

ESRC has identified some file download links used in the attack, which were not active any
longer during the analysis process because the attackers had already removed the files.
The analysis result of the malicious DOC Word file used for the attack reveals that the
shellcode is combined with the obfuscated malicious VBA macro.
When executing the shellcode, it connects to the Google Drive set as the command control
(C2) server, executes the EXE malicious module, and attempts to leak computer information to
the pCloud.

In-depth analysis of the tactics and tools used in 'Operation Spy Cloud'

When a malicious DOC document is executed, a fake screen appears as if a certain image
area is not displaying properly as follows, with the phrase saying that 'This picture is not
automatically downloaded from the Internet to protect personal information.' on the top of
the document.
The attackers trick users into believing that the image is not displayed properly due to the
privacy protection and clicking the [Enable Content] button.

[Figure 2] Malicious document disguised as a file related to North Korean refugees

The following VBA macro functions are included in the DOC document, and the malicious
function is activated when the [Enable Content] button is executed.
In the first stage, it uses the 'CreateMutex' function to declare the mutex as 'm_mtn' value to
avoid duplicate execution.

Option Explicit
Private Declare PtrSafe Function CreateMutex Lib "kernel32" Alias "CreateMutexA" (ByVal
lpMutexAttributes As Long, ByVal bInitialOwner As Long, ByVal lpName As String) As Long
Private m_mt As Long
Private Sub ghjkjhgyujx()
m_mt = CreateMutex(0, 1, "m_mtn")
Dim er As Long: er = Err.LastDllError
If er <> 0 Then
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
Application.Quit
Else
End If
End Sub

Then, the producer checks for the file name of a specific foreign security program using Mid
function in the string list, and if it does not exist, continues the decoding routine. Therefore, it
can be used as ‘kill switch’ depending on the conditions.

- c:\windows\avp.exe
- c:\windows\kavsvc.exe
- c:\windows\clisve.exe

[Figure 3] Function to check for a specific security program

Next, it registers the registry key to modify the macro security settings as follows:
It replaces the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\(Version)\Word\Security\AccessVBOM
value with '1', which allows secure access to the VBA project object model in developer macro
settings. It also declares a specific encoding string to decode the obfuscated shellcode listed at
the bottom of the macro function.

[Figure 4] Registering the registry key and shellcode decoding string declaration

str_on = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
&*(),.#+=
str_en = 7JX9A)dwxBU+13rv&tC,uYz=Z0RS8aM4FqnD5h
2WpQOGfbmNKPcLelj(kogHs.#yi*IET6V

The 72 byte-string is replaced with a string that is symmetrical at each position and
rearranged. The shellcode is one of the key areas in the following macro functions.

[Figure 5] Encoded shellcode area

The analysis of the shellcode identifies the command attempting to connect to a specific
Google Drive, which is used as a command control (C2) server. In this case, a security
detection system could determine it as a normal connection.

[Figure 6] Access to Google Drive, the C2 server using the shellcode command

Google Drive includes a file named 'invoice.sca' disguised as an invoice file.
The last modified time of the file is on the afternoon of March 10, 2020, and the file is
encrypted with XOR algorithm. The owner who shared the file is using the Gmail account
'godlemessy@gamil.com'. The analysis result shows that it was the G-mail account used by
the group behind the campaign, which has often seen in similar threat cases previously.

The 'invoice.sca' file (0xbf 0x7a 0x79 0x51 4 bytes) is XOR-encrypted in iterative decoding
scheme, then the malicious module inside will appear.

[Figure 8] Comparison of payload decoding

The decoded malicious code communicates to the cloud server using pCloud access token
data, steal the system information, and installs the additional backdoors according to the
attacker's intention. The main functions of the spy module are not much different from the
tools used by the 'Guemseong 121' group.

[Figure 9] Access token for pCloud communication

The information such as the json file containing the account history and the email address
that the attacker used, and when the attacker signed up for the service have been identified
by browsing the account of the attacker who registered the cloud service based on the API.

"registered": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 06:40:53 +0000",
"email": "kpsa-press@daum.net",

The information reveals that the attacker registered the cloud service on April 10, 2019, and
signed up with the Daum/kakao account 'kpsa-press@daum.net'.

[Figure 10] json file information used for registration of cloud service

ESRC has released an email address similar to 'kpsa-press@daum.net' in the report titled
'Geumseong121's APT attack impersonating the Ministry of Unification, distribute malware to
Google Drive' in April 2019.
The previously discovered email address 'kpsapress@gmail.com' was using the domain of
Google Gmail instead of Daum/kakao account.
The Gmail's recovery email is set as 'kps·······@d···.net', which is similar to the account 'kpsapress@daum.net'.

[Figure 11] Analysis of Google Account Recovery

However, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and the final payload are exactly the
same as the materials that were used for 'Operation Spy Cloud'.
The research findings so far suggest that the 'Geumseong 121' group is using the same
strategies and technologies in the same way as it was in its previous attacks.

Similarity comparison analysis of 'Spy Cloud' and 'Geumseong 121' attack
cases

ESRC released the threat intelligence report 'Operation Printing Paper 3', in which in-depth
data and Indicator (IoC) data ensuring that the same group is behind the 'Operation Spy
Cloud' APT attack are included, on Threat Inside service on March 13, 2020.

[Figure 12] The latest threat intelligence report cover page of the same APT group

ESRC has analyzed multiple attack traces of 'Operation Spy Cloud' quite comprehensively,
finding out that the 'Guemseong 121' group's cyber operation activities and threat indicators
are strongly connected.
Several e-mail accounts and subscription information of Internet cloud service used by
attackers are the same exactly, some of which have been changed or revoked.
In particular, Google Gmail accounts found in DOC malicious documents were recycled as
they were used in HWP malicious documents, and several HWP post script techniques used in
vulnerability attacks also overlapped.
Moreover, not only Windows-based malicious files but also Android-based smartphone attack
methods have been found in the 'Operation Spy Cloud' campaign.

[Figure 13] Comparative analysis of 'Guemseong 121' attack cases

The same technique has been used for most PostScripts of the HWP malicious document file.
The similarity is very high in variable declaration, etc., and the same post scripts are used in
some cases. New techniques have been introduced to evade detection of security solutions in
some variants.

[Figure 14] Comparison of postscript techniques used in malicious hwp documents

The comparative analysis of the functions of the final payload binary files generated when the
vulnerability in the hwp document is triggered indicates that they consist of the same
commands. Also, cloud services such as Dropbox and pCloud have been used as command
control (C2) servers for information leaks.

[Figure 15] Comparison of final binary functions installed as a hwp document file

As we have seen so far, the 'Geumseong 121' group has been continuously carrying out the
multiple threat activities targeting against South Korea.

ESRC analyzed many hacking tools and strategies used by the 'Guemseong 121' group to
confirm that the group has carried out cyber reconnaissance on a daily basis.
As cyber criminals become increasingly sophisticated and cyber security threats continue to
rise and government-supported cyber operations emerge as a threat to national security,
threat intelligence-based response and cooperation in cybersecurity is urgently needed.
We will provide you with more detailed information related to our research containing the
threat cases and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) information of the 'Geumseong 121' group
on the 'Threat Inside' service.
