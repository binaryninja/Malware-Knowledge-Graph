Cat Scratch Fever: CrowdStrike Tracks Newly Reported Iranian Actor
as FLYING KITTEN

Today, our friends at FireEye released a report on an Iran-based adversary they are calling Saffron Rose.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has also been tracking and reporting internally on this threat group since midJanuary 2014 under the name FLYING KITTEN, and since that time has seen targeting of multiple U.S.based defense contractors as well as political dissidents.
Flying Kitten Targeted Intrusion
FireEye’s report notes that this adversary’s targeted intrusion activity consists of credential theft and
malware delivery individually. The FLYING KITTEN campaigns investigated by CrowdStrike Intelligence
showed that the actor actually combines the two. For example, the adversary will register a domain that
spoofs the name of the targeted organization and then host a spoofed login page on that site.

The page is used to steal legitimate credentials, but once users enter the credentials, they are often
redirected to a new page that prompts them to download a “Browser Patch” or other similar type of file.
The downloaded file is actually the Stealer malware that exfiltrates stolen data to an FTP server.

In addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting, it also appears that FLYING KITTEN is also
engaged in broader targeting via the website parmanpower[.]com. This website is registered via the same
registrant email (info[@]usa.gov.us) and other Whois information as some of the other domains related to
the activity discussed above. It purports to be the website of a business engaged in recruiting, training, and
development in Erbil, Iraq.

No malicious activity has been linked to this domain, however, the fact that it was registered under the
same registrant email at the same time as other FLYING KITTEN domains linked to malicious activity, it
is likely that the adversary is using this site for malicious purposes as well. The website does not appear to
deliver any malware, so its most likely purpose is to act as a credential-collection mechanism much like
the spoofed Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference website
(aeroconf2014[.]org) the adversary used earlier this year. This spoofed recruiting company website could
be used to target entities across a wide range of sectors.
Attribution
Attribution in this case is interesting, as the adversary appears to have made a mistake when registering
its malicious domains. The registrant email that currently appears in the Whois records of some of the
FLYING KITTEN domains is info[@]usa.gov.us, however historical records show that the domains were
originally registered under the email address keyvan.ajaxtm[@]gmail.com.

As FireEye’s report notes, the keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail.com email address ties back to an Iran-based entity
called Ajax Security Team. Earlier this year, Ajax Security had an easily identifiable presence on the
Internet with its own website and related Facebook pages.

This Internet presence has decreased significantly since early 2014, likely due to a desire to keep a lower
profile now that the group is engaged in targeted intrusion activity.
The following Yara rules will provide detection for the adversary remote access toolkit and exfiltration
tool:
rule CrowdStrike_FlyingKitten : rat
{
meta:

copyright = "CrowdStrike, Inc"
description = "Flying Kitten RAT"
version = "1.0"
actor = "FLYING KITTEN"
in_the_wild = true
strings:
$classpath = "Stealer.Properties.Resources.resources"
$pdbstr = "\Stealer\obj\x86\Release\Stealer.pdb"
condition:
all of them and
uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and
uint16(uint32(0x3C) + 0x16) & 0x2000 == 0 and
((uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x010b and
uint32(uint32(0x3c)+232) > 0) or
(uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x020b and
uint32(uint32(0x3c)+248) > 0))
}
rule CrowdStrike_CSIT_14003_03 : installer
{
meta:
copyright = "CrowdStrike, Inc"
description = "Flying Kitten Installer"
version = "1.0"

actor = "FLYING KITTEN"
in_the_wild = true
strings:
$exename = "IntelRapidStart.exe"
$confname = "IntelRapidStart.exe.config"
$cabhdr = { 4d 53 43 46 00 00 00 00 }
condition:
all of them
}
You can use this rule with CrowdStrike’s free CrowdResponse tool to easily scan your systems for presence
of FLYING KITTEN.
