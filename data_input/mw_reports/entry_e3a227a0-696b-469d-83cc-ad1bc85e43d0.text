'World's Most Wanted Man' Involved in Bizarre Attempt to
Buy Hacking Tools

The fugitive executive of the embattled payment startup Wirecard was mentioned in a brazen
and bizarre attempt to purchase hacking tools and surveillance technology from an Italian
company in 2013, an investigation by Motherboard and the German weekly Der Spiegel
found.
Jan Marsalek, a 40-year-old Austrian who until recently was the chief operating officer of the
rising fintech company Wirecard, seems to have taken a meeting with the infamous Italian
surveillance technology provider Hacking Team in 2013. At the time, Marsalek is described
as an official representative of the government of Grenada, a small Caribbean island of
around 100,000 people, in a letter that bears the letterhead of the Grenada government. The
documents were included in a cache published after Hacking Team was hacked in 2015. In
recent days, Marsalek has been described as the 'world's most wanted man.'
It is unclear from the documents alone whether Marsalek played any role in the attempt to
procure hacking tools, or whether his name was simply used. However, months before
Marsalek appears to have contacted with Hacking Team, several websites with official
sounding names such as StateOfGrenada.org were registered under the name of Jan

Marsalek, as Der Spiegel reported last week. Some of the sites were registered with
Marsalek’s phone number and his Munich address at the time, and the servers were
apparently operated from Germany.
Wirecard provided digital payment services and was considered one of the most important
companies in the financial tech industry. Wirecard offered a mobile payment app called
Boon, which was essentially a virtual MasterCard card, it also offered a prepaid debit card
called mycard2go, and worked with companies such as KLM, Rakuten, and Qatar Airways to
manage their online transactions. The company suddenly collapsed in June after German
regulators raided its headquarters as part of an investigation into fraudulent stock price
manipulation and 1.9 billion euros that are missing from the company’s books. Marsalek is
now a fugitive and a key suspect in the German investigation. He reportedly fled to Belarus,
and is now hiding in Russia under the protection of the FSB, according to German news
reports. In the past, he was involved in other strange dealings: he bragged about an attempt
to recruit 15,000 Libyan militiamen, and about a trip to Syria along with Russian military,
according to the Financial Times.
“Further to your discussion with our representative, Mr. Jan Marsalek, we would like to
hereby confirm the interest of the Government of Grenada in exploring a potential acquisition
of the smartphone interception platform of your company,” reads what appears to be an
official Grenada government letter dated October 31, 2013 allegedly signed by the Minister
for Foreign Affairs Nickolas Steele.
A letter that was attached to emails between a Mexican intermediary and Hacking Team.
Along with a Mexican intermediary, Marsalek appears to have brokered a meeting in Milan at
Hacking Team’s headquarters on November 27, 2013, according to the leaked emails. An
email dated November 28 mentions a “fruitful meeting” with Marsalek and an associate
“regarding Grenada.”
“Mr. Marsalek will report his impressions to the Grenada officers, if positive, the process will
take around three weeks. Please keep us updated,” wrote Marco Bettini, one of Hacking
Team’s founders and the then sales manager.
A former Hacking Team employee, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed receiving
the emails regarding the meeting. He said, however, that he was not present at the meeting.
As it turns out, Marsalek was never a Grenada government representative, Der Spiegel and
Motherboard have found.
In a phone call, Steele, who is now the Minister Health in Grenada said the document leaked
in the Hacking Team emails is fraudulent.

“I can categorically state that the letter in your attachment bearing a resemblance to my
signature and office at that time is a fraudulent document,” Steele said in the phone call,
referring to the apparent business deal between Grenada and Hacking Team. “I certainly did
not make that request or any such request.”

Steele confirmed to Spiegel and Motherboard that he had met Marsalek and another person
whose name is mentioned in the document in the summer 2013. “He was a very charismatic
young man and a smooth talker,” Steele remembers. The meetings were about a business
proposal from Marsalek involving Wirecard technology. In the end, however, no deal was
made, Steele said.
The head of Encryptech, a Mexican company that is mentioned in the letter, and which
worked as an intermediary between Hacking Team and some government customers, called
the letter “fake.”
“They used the name of my company without authorization,” Alfonso Ayensa said in an
online chat.
The spyware deal, however, never went through. It is impossible to say from the documents
alone who was attempting to procure these hacking tools, what they were going to be used
for, or how involved Marsalek was. Hacking Team has always maintained that it only sold its
products to government agencies, after obtaining an export license from the Italian
government. Had this deal gone through, it would have been the first known case where
Hacking Team’s powerful spyware ended up in the hands of private citizens.
Paolo Lezzi, the head of Memento Labs, the company that was born out of Hacking Team’s
ashes, said Grenada was never a customer, based on the company’s internal documents he
has access to. Two other former Hacking Team employees who worked there in 2013 and
onwards, said Grenada never purchased the company's products.
