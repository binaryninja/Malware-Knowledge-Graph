A first-of-its-kind malware targeting Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Lambda serverless computing
platform has been discovered in the wild.
Dubbed "Denonia" after the name of the domain it communicates with, "the malware uses newer
address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures
and virtual network access controls," Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir said.

The artifact analyzed by the cybersecurity company was uploaded to the VirusTotal database on
February 25, 2022, sporting the name "python" and packaged as a 64-bit ELF executable.

However, the filename is a misnomer, as Denonia is programmed in Go and harbors a customized
variant of the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software. That said, the mode of initial access is
unknown, although it's suspected it may have involved the compromise of AWS Access and Secret
Keys.

Another notable feature of the malware is its use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for communicating
with its command-and-control server ("gw.denonia[.]xyz") by concealing the traffic within encrypted
DNS queries.
In a statement shared with The Hacker News, Amazon stressed that "Lambda is secure by default,
and AWS continues to operate as designed," and that users violating its acceptable use policy
(AUP) will be prohibited from using its services.

While Denonia has been clearly designed to target AWS Lambda since it checks for Lambda
environment variables prior to its execution, Cado Labs also found that it can be run outside of it in
a standard Linux server environment.
"The software described by the researcher does not exploit any weakness in Lambda or any other
AWS service," the company said. "Since the software relies entirely on fraudulently obtained
account credentials, it is a distortion of facts to even refer to it as malware because it lacks the
ability to gain unauthorized access to any system by itself."
However, "python" isn't the only sample of Denonia unearthed so far, what with Cado Labs finding a
second sample (named "bc50541af8fe6239f0faa7c57a44d119.virus") that was uploaded to
VirusTotal on January 3, 2022.

"Although this first sample is fairly innocuous in that it only runs crypto-mining software, it
demonstrates how attackers are using advanced cloud-specific knowledge to exploit complex cloud
infrastructure, and is indicative of potential future, more nefarious attacks," Muir said.
