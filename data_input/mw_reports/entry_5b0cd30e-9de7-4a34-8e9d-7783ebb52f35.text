For several weeks, eyes around the world have been set on the war in Ukraine and events
that have transpired as a result.
The economic sanctions affecting Russian banks and enterprises are some of many
consequences that persist as main talking points across international media outlets. This
presented yet another opportunity for attackers to leverage this subject for targeted attacks

and/or phishing campaigns.
We uncovered a very interesting document that was observed impersonating the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission. It is our assumption with a high degree of
probability that an attacker called Cloud Atlas is responsible for this malicious campaign.

The document appears to be a request to obtain data from Russian clients.

Let's dive into the analysis of this document to examine the payload as well as what
techniques are in use.

The purpose of the first stage of the attack, as is often the case, is to retrieve and execute
the payload of the next stage. In the image above we find a URL address which points to a
ZIP file containing compressed suspicious data to be executed on the system.

After downloading this installation package, the program starts installing the executable
components. The installation file contains a few legitimate files along with one malicious
library (main) that is installed in the following directory.
%LOCALAPPDATA%\EdgeTools\edgecef.dll

We believe that this is one of the malicious tools of the Cloud Atlas APT group. It beacons
out to a remote server, waiting for further commands. Initially, this sample collects information
about the system it is running on, which is then exfiltrated to the remote server.
This attacker has been active for many years, identified in 2014, the group is known for using
documents to infect government organizations such as embassies or organizations affiliated
with the aerospace industry.
