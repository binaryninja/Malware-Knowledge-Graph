The Duties Beyond Assisting the Public: Darknet Threats
Against Canadian Health & Support Organizations

As if a global pandemic crisis isn’t enough, organizations focused on the health and support
of citizens have been forced to combat not only a widespread virus (and the public needs
that come with it), but also threats coming at them from the underground world. As the
pandemic continues to affect all types of both private- and government-affiliated
organizations worldwide, KELA’s Cyber Intelligence Center took a look into various assets
pertaining to Canadian health and support organizations to assess how their attack surfaces
may be affected. This blog post will highlight just a couple of darknet findings that our team
has detected, which exemplify how threat actors are targeting these types of organizations in
Canada.

Exploring New Victims
As COVID-19-related scams continue to rise, actors behind cheque fraud have now
expanded their portfolio, targeting a new group of victims — Canadian relief programs. Take
the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for example. Our analysts at KELA

discovered various offerings for cheques claimed to resemble those of CERB, inviting
fraudsters to profit by receiving potential funding. It works very simply. Threat actors make
these cheques ready to use by offering buyers either scans or prints of lookalike government
cheques, which they then can deposit into their “drop” accounts, preferably via mobile
deposit.
Here’s a peak into some of the CERB offerings that were available last week on a credible
and well-known Canadian-focused underground market:

Exploring New Markets
Familiar and “everyday” threats are targeting very sensitive organizations during this crisis,
but there are some rather “new” threat types booming as well. In addition to the botnet
markets, hacking forums, instant messaging platforms, and other underground sites that
KELA automatically monitors, KELA’s technologies now gather intelligence from automated
shops that sell access to compromised servers.
We dived into a market of this type and detected webshell access to a subdomain of the one
of the largest hospitals in Toronto (among other health-related organizations) for sale. The
fortunate threat actor that purchases this can instantly be granted access to remotely control
the hospital’s server at any time, which in turn enables them to perform a variety of different
actions depending on the breached server purchased. To state an example, let’s take
something very common that’s been hitting many headlines recently – ransomware attacks.
Being granted access to controlling one’s servers from a distance can, among other things,
lead to a ransomware attack, therefore placing organizations in a high-risk situation amid all
other COVID-19 issues they are faced with. Organizations – especially those related to the
healthcare sector – cannot afford even the smallest potential cyber attack as they deal with
larger, more critical issues.

These are two examples of webshell access for sale pertaining to two different health-related
organizations in Canada. These listing were posted in a remote access marketplace. KELA’s
DARKBEAST indexes data from this market, among others, and allows users to search through them in
real-time.

What Can We Do?
Let’s state the truth: threat actors – for the most part – aren’t on pause with much of the rest
of the world. So, the real question asked is How can security practitioners develop some
level of protection as COVID-19 continues? The key here is for organizations to establish
and maintain resiliency – in our case, with targeted threat intelligence monitoring. These
professionals should be investing all efforts in monitoring their sensitive assets as seen by
the underground community, in an aim of deterring potential cyberattacks against them. With
proactive monitoring, organizations related to the health and support of citizens can focus
their efforts on dealing with citizen-focused issues during these unprecedented times.
