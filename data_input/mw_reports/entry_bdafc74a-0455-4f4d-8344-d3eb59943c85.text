Android Malware Posing as Google Play Store App Installer
During our routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, Cyble Research Labs came across
various malware samples of Coper malware from a third-party intelligence website. Coper is linked to
ExoBotCompat, a revised version of Exobot Android malware.
Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many
defensive tactics to survive removal attempts. Coper malware was initially discovered targeting
Colombian users around July 2021.
Newer versions of the Coper Banking trojan have been observed targeting Android users in different
countries across Europe. They are anticipated to expand their scope to other regions in the future,
targeting a variety of banking apps worldwide.

This type of malware is generally known for impersonating financial institution apps called
Bancolombia Personas. Newer versions of the Coper malware also started to adopt impersonating
Utility apps.
The infection itself is broken down into two distinct phases. The first step is to install the fake app that
the Threat Actors (TAs) pass off as banking software. This app is nothing more than a dropper, and its
sole purpose is to disseminate and install the primary harmful module hidden within the malicious app.
The features in the current version of Coper malware are listed below:
Send USSD requests
Send SMS
Lock the device screen
Unlock the device screen
Start intercepting SMS
Stop intercepting SMS
Display a push notification
Re-display phishing window on top of the specified app
Run a keylogger
Stop a keylogger
Uninstall applications specified in the command
Uninstall itself with the dropper app

Manifest Description
The fake Play Store app asks for 32 permissions, of which the TA takes advantage of 12. The
malware’s harmful permission requests are listed below:
Permission

Description

READ_PHONE_STATE

Allows the application to access the phone features of the device

ADD_VOICEMAIL

Allows an application to add voicemails into the system

CALL_PHONE

Allows the application to call phone numbers without your
intervention

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

Allows an application to read from external storage.

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

Allows an application to write to external storage.

WRITE_SETTINGS

Allows an application to modify the system’s settings data.

CALL_PHONE

Perform call without user intervention

READ_SMS

Access user’s SMSs stored in the device

RECEIVE_SMS

Fetch and process SMS messages

SEND_SMS

Allows the app to send SMS messages

SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW

Allows to display system alerts over other apps

We found the activity class that is initiated when the app is launched via the icon. This was determined
by looking at the Android components declared in the Manifest file. Figure 3 depicts the declaration of
this activity.

Figure 3 – Launcher Activity
In addition to the launcher activity, the application’s Manifest file contains several receivers & services
and the application’s subclass.

Source Code Review
Apart from the application’s subclass, the rest of the components identified from the Manifest file are
missing. Hence, we can infer that the application is packed.
“com.theseeye5.KSNckdWjjyIXg” is the applications subclass initiated on launching the application.
The application loads its components from the library file upon analyzing the subclass, as shown below.

Figure 4 – Application’s Subclass loading library file
The project file browser can also be used for viewing the library file’s presence. libyvr.so is visible in
the screenshot below.

Figure 5 – Library file in Project file representation

Upon analyzing the “.so” file, the application acts as a dropper, which is the initial phase of the Coper
malware that drops and installs the malware’s primary harmful module hiding inside the victim’s Android
device.

As seen in Figure 4, the file drops an encrypted.dex file. This file can be decrypted to reveal the Coper
malware’s malicious code, as shown below.

Figure 6 – Decrypted Dex file

Upon analyzing the decrypted.dex file, we were able to find the presence of missed Receivers,
Services, and Mainactivity of the application. Below, we have listed the malicious activities the
application can perform:
The application uses the Device Administration API along with the DeviceAdminReceiver subclass
to enable/disable device admin to the apps that users install on their devices.

The application can read all the incoming SMS messages from the infected device.

Figure 8 – Reading Incoming SMS
The application’s entry point/launcher activity reads installed packages from the user’s device.

Figure 9 – Launcher activity of the malicious application
The malware reads the incoming notifications by verifying the packages and steals the messages
from the notification using Notification Listener Service.

Like other Banking Trojans, Coper malware requests users to enable the Accessibility Service to
perform various Accessibility Event types to conduct malicious activities, as shown in the below figure.

8/14

Figure 11 – Accessibility Event Types
The malware maintains a connection with the C&C server and queries it every minute. If the malware
gets the relevant instructions from the C&C server, the time interval can be altered to ensure the
malware gets sufficient time to perform other malicious functionalities.
Coper malware may also alter additional configuration parameters, as shown in Figure 12.

The list of webinjects or applications for which malicious apps attempt to steal data were also identified.
Coper malware usually has a targeted list of applications in their remote server that prohibits them from
running in the infected device. Coper malware actively targets banking applications across Europe,
Australia, and even parts of South America.
The malware also receives commands from the TA through the C&C URL hard coded within the app in
encrypted text. Figure 13 depicts the list of commands stored within the app in encrypted text.

Figure 13 –

Commands received from C&C server
The list of commands used in Coper malware are given below:
Command

Coper trojans have several defense measures. Controlling the integrity of the core malicious component
is one of them. The Copper malware will attempt to restore it if it is removed.
Coper malware also has a secondary safety measure to monitor potentially harmful behavior to the
trojan, such as:
The user trying to modify the device administrators’ list user access to the trojan’s information
page from the system’s list of installed apps.
The user visiting the Google Play Protect page in the Play Store app.

11/14

The user changes the trojan’s access privileges for the Accessibility Services features.

Conclusion
According to our research, Banking trojans no longer conduct assaults only based on overlay or using
rented Mobility as a Service (MaaS), as previously detected in numerous Banking Trojan malware
variants.
This malware uses Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to initiate screen recording services by
recognizing the foreground settings in the list of apps.
Financial institutions must strengthen their mobile-first approach and prepare for the challenges posed
by this virus by understanding the security landscape. This aim may be achieved by implementing a
real-time threat-driven mobile security strategy.
