DoppelPaymer Continues to Cause Grief Through
Rebranding
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/doppelpaymer-continues-cause-grief-through-rebranding

In early May 2021, DoppelPaymer ransomware activity dropped significantly. Although the
DoppelPaymer leak site still remains online, there has not been a new victim post since May
6, 2021. In addition, no victim posts have been updated since the end of June. This lull is
likely a reaction to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack which occurred on May 7, 2021.
However, the apparent break is due to the threat group behind DoppelPaymer rebranding
the ransomware under the name Grief (aka Pay OR Grief). An early Grief ransomware (aka
Pay or Grief) sample was compiled on May 17, 2021. This sample is particularly interesting
because it contains the Grief ransomware code and ransom note, but the link in the ransom
note points to the DoppelPaymer ransom portal. This suggests that the malware author may
have still been in the process of developing the Grief ransom portal. Ransomware threat
groups often rebrand the name of the malware as a diversion.
In this blog, we will compare the similarities between DoppelPaymer and Grief ransomware.
Both ransomware leak sites are nearly identical, including shared code that displays a
captcha to prevent automated crawling as shown in Figure 1.

The main landing page has changed the term latest proofs to griefs in progress and latest
leaks to complete griefs. The victim-specific leak page layouts are also identical as shown
below in Figure 2 containing the victims URL, organizational description, images of stolen
data, example stolen data files, and a list of machines that were compromised.

The Grief ransom portal has some differences from the DoppelPaymer portal. In particular,
the ransom demand payment method is made in Monero (XMR) instead of Bitcoin (BTC).
This switch in cryptocurrencies may be in response to the FBI recovering part of the Colonial
Pipeline ransom payment. The Grief ransom portal, however, kept the same live chat code
that allows victims to resume a previous conversation or to start a new conversation as
shown in Figure 3.

Grief ransomware portal and leak site also attempts to weaponize the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to pressure businesses into paying a ransom to
avoid potential fines.
The malware code differences between DoppelPaymer and Grief are also relatively minimal.
Grief samples removed the embedded ProcessHacker binaries. However, Grief still retains
the code to decrypt data from the binary’s .sdata section. The Grief string encryption
algorithm is similar to DoppelPaymer, except the RC4 key was increased from a length of 40
bytes to 48 bytes. The vast majority of the two codebases are very similar with identical
encryption algorithms (2048-bit RSA and 256-bit AES), import hashing, and entry point
offset calculation.

Conclusion
Grief ransomware is the latest version of DoppelPaymer ransomware with minor code
changes and a new cosmetic theme. The threat group has been very active since the
release of Grief in the middle of May 2021. However, they have been successful in
maintaining a low profile so far. This is in light of recent high-profile attacks including the
Colonial Pipeline hack by Darkside ransomware and the Kaseya supply-chain attack by
REvil.
