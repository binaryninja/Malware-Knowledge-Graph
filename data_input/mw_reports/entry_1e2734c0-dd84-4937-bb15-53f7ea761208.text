Phish Found in Environments Protected by SEGs
Mimecast
Microsoft EOP
Microsoft ATP
By Adam Martin, Nathaniel Sagibanda, Kian Buckley Maher and Cofense Phishing Defense
Center
The PDC team has seen a recent up-tick in legitimate Mimecast services being used
as a vector for phishing campaigns found in environments protected by Microsoft ATP,
Microsoft EOP and Mimecast.
The phish leverage the “Payment Order,” a common vector for enticing users into
initiating the process set out by a malicious actor to attain sensitive credentials (Figure 1).

Figure 1
In this attack, as illustrated in figures, the body of the email is a reasonable facsimile of an
authentic message that even replicates the style of the Mimecast heading and disclaimer.
But grammatical, punctuation and spacing anomalies represent red flags. Furthermore, the
email itself looks benign, simple and straight to the point, informing the recipient that the
required information is behind an external service due to an issue with storage size or
formatting (Figure 1). This is a common tactic that allows malicious actors to circumvent mail
filters such as Mimecast, Microsoft EOP and Microsoft ATP.

Figure 2
Upon inspection of the “Download Files” button we can see that the service being used to
deliver this phish is in fact Mimecast, itself a legitimate service. Combining this with the
previously noted circumvention method makes standard detection almost impossible.

Figure 3
As seen in Figure 3, the page presented to the user is a legitimate Mimecast service being
used to host the malicious file. This is compounded by the use of a key to gain access to the
file by clicking the access-key button or entering a previously provided key (see Figure 3).
However, both methods will direct the user to the next stage.

Once access has been gained to the first landing page, there will be an option to download
the malicious file at the side of the page. To add authenticity, the credentials of the original
sender have been replicated, as shown below in Figure 4.

Figure 6
Email Header analysis: Taking a look at the headers on Figure 6, it is a different
story altogether. IP addresses such as [10.x.x.182 and 10.x.x.36] are used by independent
operating networks. These may be as small as a single computer connected to a
home gateway, and are installed in hundreds of millions of devices automatically.
However, IP 41.x.x.131 belongs to MimecastSA (according to VirusTotal and Whois), and
could be the reason it escaped SEG detection.

Figure 7
Having accessed the malicious link, the user will see the above page
displayed (Figure 7) with a request for the user’s Microsoft email address and password.
Unlike other credential phishing pages, the Microsoft background and logo aren’t displayed.
The simplicity of the page, combined with a URL lacking indicators of Microsoft or associated
domains, is suspect. The third field is the most obvious red flag (Figure 7): A recovery option
is made available even though an incorrect password hasn’t been entered. This is
done to prompt the victim into providing a phone number.

Having inserted test credentials, the information is exported to the phishing campaign
URL address. This site is hosted by hxxps://www.docdroid[.]net/OwKxXnZ/purchase-order00177389-pdf. Entering information will continually refresh the page regardless of credentials
supplied.
