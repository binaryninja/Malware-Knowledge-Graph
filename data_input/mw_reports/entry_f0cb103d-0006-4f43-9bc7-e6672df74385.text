Ransomware Hit ATM Giant Diebold Nixdorf

Diebold Nixdorf, a major provider of automatic teller machines (ATMs) and payment
technology to banks and retailers, recently suffered a ransomware attack that disrupted
some operations. The company says the hackers never touched its ATMs or customer
networks, and that the intrusion only affected its corporate network.
Canton, Ohio-based Diebold [NYSE: DBD] is
currently the largest ATM provider in the United
States, with an estimated 35 percent of the cash
machine market worldwide. The 35,000-employee
company also produces point-of-sale systems and
software used by many retailers.
According to Diebold, on the evening of Saturday,
April 25, the company’s security team discovered anomalous behavior on its corporate
network. Suspecting a ransomware attack, Diebold said it immediately began disconnecting
systems on that network to contain the spread of the malware.
Sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Diebold’s response affected services for over 100 of the
company’s customers. Diebold said the company’s response to the attack did disrupt a
system that automates field service technician requests, but that the incident did not affect
customer networks or the general public.
“Diebold has determined that the spread of the malware has been contained,” Diebold said in
a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity. “The incident did not affect ATMs,
customer networks, or the general public, and its impact was not material to our business.
Unfortunately, cybercrime is an ongoing challenge for all companies. Diebold Nixdorf takes
the security of our systems and customer service very seriously. Our leadership has
connected personally with customers to make them aware of the situation and how we
addressed it.”
NOT SO PRO LOCK
An investigation determined that the intruders installed the ProLock ransomware, which
experts say is a relatively uncommon ransomware strain that has gone through multiple
names and iterations over the past few months.
For example, until recently ProLock was better known as “PwndLocker,” which is the name
of the ransomware that infected servers at Lasalle County, Ill. in March. But the miscreants
behind PwndLocker rebranded their malware after security experts at Emsisoft released a

tool that let PwndLocker victims decrypt their files without paying the ransom.
Diebold claims it did not pay the ransom demanded by the attackers, although the company
wouldn’t discuss the amount requested. But Lawrence Abrams of BleepingComputer said
the ransom demanded for ProLock victims typically ranges in the six figures, from $175,000
to more than $660,000 depending on the size of the victim network.
Fabian Wosar, Emsisoft’s chief technology officer, said if Diebold’s claims about not paying
their assailants are true, it’s probably for the best: That’s because current versions of
ProLock’s decryptor tool will corrupt larger files such as database files.
As luck would have it, Emsisoft does offer a tool that fixes the decryptor so that it properly
recovers files held hostage by ProLock, but it only works for victims who have already paid a
ransom to the crooks behind ProLock.
“We do have a tool that fixes a bug in the decryptor, but it doesn’t work unless you have the
decryption keys from the ransomware authors,” Wosar said.
WEEKEND WARRIORS
BleepingComputer’s Abrams said the timing of the attack on Diebold — Saturday evening —
is quite common, and that ransomware purveyors tend to wait until the weekends to launch
their attacks because that is typically when most organizations have the fewest number of
technical staff on hand. Incidentally, weekends also are the time when the vast majority of
ATM skimming attacks take place — for the same reason.
“After hours on Friday and Saturday nights are big, because they want to pull the trigger [on
the ransomware] when no one is around,” Abrams said.
Many ransomware gangs have taken to stealing sensitive data from victims before launching
the ransomware, as a sort of virtual cudgel to use against victims who don’t immediately
acquiesce to a ransom demand.
Armed with the victim’s data — or data about the victim company’s partners or customers —
the attackers can then threaten to publish or sell the information if victims refuse to pay up.
Indeed, some of the larger ransomware groups are doing just that, constantly updating blogs
on the Internet and the dark Web that publish the names and data stolen from victims who
decline to pay.
So far, the crooks behind ProLock haven’t launched their own blog. But Abrams said the
crime group behind it has indicated it is at least heading in that direction, noting that in his
communications with the group in the wake of the Lasalle County attack they sent him an
image and a list of folders suggesting they’d accessed sensitive data for that victim.

“I’ve been saying this ever since last year when the Maze ransomware group started
publishing the names and data from their victims: Every ransomware attack has to be treated
as a data breach now,” Abrams said.
