ESET researchers have investigated a targeted mobile espionage campaign against the
Kurdish ethnic group. This campaign has been active since at least March 2020, distributing
(via dedicated Facebook profiles) two Android backdoors known as 888 RAT and SpyNote,
disguised as legitimate apps. These profiles appeared to be providing Android news in
Kurdish, and news for the Kurds’ supporters. Some of the profiles deliberately spread
additional spying apps to Facebook public groups with pro-Kurd content. Data from a
download site indicates at least 1,481 downloads from URLs promoted in just a few
Facebook posts.
The newly discovered Android 888 RAT has been used by the Kasablanka group and by
BladeHawk. Both of them used alternative names to refer to the same Android RAT –
LodaRAT and Gaza007 respectively.

BladeHawk Android espionage
The espionage activity reported here is directly connected to two publicly disclosed cases
published in 2020. QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center named the group behind these
attacks BladeHawk, which we have adopted. Both campaigns were distributed via
Facebook, using malware that was built with commercial, automated tools (888 RAT and
SpyNote), with all samples of the malware using the same C&C servers.

Distribution
We identified six Facebook profiles as part of this BladeHawk campaign, sharing these
Android spying apps. We reported these profiles to Facebook and they have all been taken
down. Two of the profiles were aimed at tech users while the other four posed as Kurd
supporters. All these profiles were created in 2020 and shortly after creation they started
posting these fake apps. These accounts, except for one, have not posted any other
content besides Android RATs masquerading as legitimate apps.
These profiles are also responsible for sharing espionage apps to Facebook public groups,
most of which were supporters of Masoud Barzani, former President of the Kurdistan
Region; an example can be seen in Figure 1. Altogether, the targeted groups have over
11,000 followers.

In one case, we spotted an attempt (Figure 2) to capture Snapchat credentials via a
phishing website (Figure 3).

We identified 28 unique posts as part of this BladeHawk campaign. Each of these posts
contained fake app descriptions and links to download an app, and we were able to
download 17 unique APKs from these links. Some of the APK web links pointed directly to
the malicious app, whereas others pointed to the third-party upload service top4top.io,
which tracks the number of file downloads (see Figure 4). Because of that, we obtained the
total number of downloads from top4top.io for those eight apps. These eight apps were
downloaded altogether 1,481 times, from July 20, 2020 until June 28, 2021.

Samples
To our knowledge, this campaign targeted only Android users, with the threat actors
focused on two commercial Android RAT tools – 888 RAT and SpyNote. We found only one
sample of the latter during our research. As it was built using an old, already analyzed
SpyNote builder, here we include only the analysis of the 888 RAT samples.

Android 888 RAT
This commercial, multiplatform RAT was originally only published for the Windows
ecosystem for $80. In June 2018, it was extended in the Pro version with the additional
capability to build Android RATs ($150). Later, the Extreme version could create Linux
payloads as well ($200).
It was sold via the developer’s website at 888-tools[.]com (see Figure 5).

In 2019 the Pro version (Windows and Android) was found cracked (see Figure 6) and
available on a few websites for free.

888 RAT has not been directly identified with any organized campaigns before; this is the
first time this RAT has been assigned as an indicator of a cyberespionage group.
Following this discovery, we were able to connect the Android 888 RAT to two more
organized campaigns: Spy TikTok Pro described here and a campaign by Kasablanka
Group.

Functionality
6/15

Android 888 RAT is capable of executing 42 commands received from its C&C server, as
seen in Table 1.
In short, it can steal and delete files from a device, take screenshots, get device location,
phish Facebook credentials, get a list of installed apps, steal user photos, take photos,
record surrounding audio and phone calls, make calls, steal SMS messages, steal the
device’s contact list, send text messages, etc.
The builder is also used as the C&C to control all the compromised devices since it uses
dynamic DNS to be reached by them.

An important factor when identifying 888 RAT is the package name of the payload. The
package name of every build of an Android payload is not custom or random; it always uses
the com.example.dat.a8andoserverx package ID. Because of this, it is easy to identify such
samples as 888 RAT.
In later versions of the 888 RAT (not the cracked RAT builder), we noticed that the builder
was capable of obfuscating strings (command strings, C&C, and other plain text strings) by
encrypting them using AES with a hardcoded key; however, the package name still
remained the same.

C&C
888 RAT uses a custom IP protocol and port (it doesn’t have to be standard ports).
Compromised devices are controlled directly from the builder GUI.

Facebook phishing
When this functionality is triggered, 888 RAT will deploy phishing activity that appears to be
coming from the legitimate Facebook app. When the user taps on the recent apps button,
this activity will seem legitimate, as seen in Figure 7. However, after a long press on this
app’s icon, as in Figure 8, the true app name responsible for the Facebook login request is
disclosed.

Detection
Since 2018, ESET products have identified hundreds of instances of Android devices where
the 888 RAT was deployed. Figure 9 presents the country distribution of this detection data.

Conclusion
This espionage campaign has been active since March 2020 aiming only at Android
devices. It targeted the Kurdish ethnic group through at least 28 malicious Facebook posts
that would lead potential victims to download Android 888 RAT or SpyNote. Most of the
malicious Facebook posts led to downloads of the commercial, multiplatform 888 RAT,
which has been available on the black market since 2018. In 2019, a cracked copy of the
Pro version of the 888 RAT builder was made available from a few websites, and since
then, we detected hundreds of cases all around the world using the Android 888 RAT.
