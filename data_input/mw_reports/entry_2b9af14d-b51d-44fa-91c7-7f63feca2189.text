And after Russia, US, China and DPRK (North Korea), here is the one for APT groups
associated with European Union (EU) nation-states. A big disclaimer here that I know that
many more nation-states might be operating offensive cyber operations groups, but I only
included those for which there has been some publicly known reporting associated with
them.
If you think I got something wrong or there are more groups that I’m missing, please let me
know and I’ll update the diagram as soon as possible.
Just like in the previous cases, the sources and changes log are available under the
diagram.
