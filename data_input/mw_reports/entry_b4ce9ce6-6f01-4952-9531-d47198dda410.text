What is Multigrain? Learn what makes this PoS malware
different.

Multigrain is a Point of Sale (PoS) malware that specializes in stealing credit and debit
card information while using RAM-Scraping techniques (it directly accesses the RAM
memory from certain processes to obtain the information from the cards). This has become a
popular method as international laws prohibit this information from being stored on the disk
(not even temporarily).
Another characteristic of Multigrain is that it uses DNS petitions in order to communicate with
the outside (and so it can send the stolen information). In this article we will analyze the
malware itself as well as the way the malware communicates.
In April of this year, FireEye published an analysis of this malware and it looks like this is the
first time they found a variant of Multigrain. In this article, the analysis pertains to a sample
that we detected in November 2015 (MD5 A0973ADAF99975C1EB12CC1E333D302F), and
since then we have been able to detect new variants or updates of this malware, but
essentially they work in the same way.

Multigrain in detail: a technical analysis
We first started analyzing Multigrain because the analyzed code showed RAM-Scraping
characteristics that are typical in PoS malware. We can clearly assess this in the 00405A10
routine shown below.
Within this
routine we
find
ourselves
with the
typical calls
from a
process that
performs
RAMScraping on
the memory
of running
processes:

CreateToolhelp32Snapshot to get a pointer of the process list
Process32FirstW and Process32NextW to get a snapshot of the process list after calling
the previous API.
OpenProcess is used afterwards to get a list of memory pages with VirtualQueryEx.

Finally, with ReadProcessMemory, you are able to read the content from the previous
pages.
Once the buffer is obtained using the content from each page, it will perform the
appropriately-named scraping. To do so it uses (in this same routine) the second
pseudocode:

If possible TRACKS1/2 sequences are detected, corresponding with the code from the credit
card magnetic strip in the buffers from the analyzed memory, it will proceed to call the
functions sub_406100 and sub_405D10. The malware is now ready to prepare the data so it
can be exfiltrated later.
This PoS malware is only interested in two processes, respectively named “spcwin.exe” and
“brain.exe”; if neither of them are detected, “scraping” will not be performed.

Data Exfiltration
The exfiltration performs during DNS petitions (UDP, port 53) from the routine 00402C40, as
shown in the following pseudocode:

Apparently, the information leaked by DNS is performed in three different points (two
routines) from the program:

In the first
routine
(address
00401DA0),
it uses the
“install.”
subdomain
for the
exfiltrated
information.
In the
second
routine (address 00402580) it uses the “log.” subdomain for the exfiltrated information.
In these exfiltration routines, we find different references to the functions that code the
information using “base32”. This is due to the fact that in order to exfiltrate the bank card
information, it is first encoded using “base32” and it later performs DNS requests with the
format: install.<base32_CCs>.domain

If we sort out this domain, we can see that it moves to the internal IP address “192.168.0.3”.
The domain is associated with two DNS servers, that in principle resolve eachother. To
obtain their actual addresses we should do a “whois”:
$ whois ns2.dojfgj.com
Server Name: NS1.DOJFGJ.COM
IP Address: 104.156.246.159
A “traceroute” of this IP shows us its origin:
$ traceroute 104.156.246.159

Persistence
To stay persistent in the system (Windows PoS) the analyzed malware installs itself
automatically as a service and chooses the name “Windows Module Extension”, as can be
seen in the following screenshot (routine 00406C20):

The attacker can perform exclusions at the time it registers itself as a service, now that it
already consulted the current region using “ipinfo.io” and depending on the response, the
system may or may not register as a service. This is especially useful if the attacker wants to
avoid attacking PoS systems in certain countries, for example.
The malware accepts “i” as parameter (from “install”), and in that case it will install the
“scraping” process and send the stolen information.
If this parameter is not specified (“i”), in the case it doesn’t find the “spcwin.exe” or
“brain.exe” processes running, it will not install the service, and additionally the malware will
be automatically eliminated. Both processes pertain to PoS software.
