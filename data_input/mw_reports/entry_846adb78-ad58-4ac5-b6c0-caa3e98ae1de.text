After a several-month military buildup on Ukraine’s borders, on 24 February 2022, Russian
President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine.1 This offensive also has a cyber
component that could potentially affect parties in multiple locations, including Ukraine,
NATO countries, and their allies, according to US and UK government assessments.
