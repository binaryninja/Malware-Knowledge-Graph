Ransomware actors were off to a running start in 2022, ramping up their activity as more
gangs joined the fray. Using data from ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and extortion
groups’ leak sites, Trend Micro’s open-source intelligence (OSINT) research, and the Trend
Micro™ Smart Protection Network™, we mapped out the ransomware threat landscape of
the first quarter (from Jan. 1 to March 31) of 2022. We tracked ransomware activity with a
focus on the malicious actor groups behind the three ransomware families that pulled in the
highest numbers of successful attacks during this period: the notorious LockBit and Conti,
and the rising player BlackCat.

Ransomware threats post year-on-year growth
Our telemetry showed that during this three-month span, we detected and blocked a total of
4,439,903 ransomware threats across email, URL, and file layers. This is a 36.6% increase
in overall ransomware threats from the previous quarter (the fourth quarter of 2021), and a
1/17

4.3% year-on-year rise (from the first quarter of 2021).
The number of RaaS and extortion groups grew by 63.2% in the first quarter of 2022 over the
same period the previous year, an increase that inevitably led to more organizations falling
prey to ransomware activity. According to the ransomware groups’ leak sites, which recorded
attacks on successfully compromised organizations that refused to pay the ransom,
ransomware victims rose by 29.2% year-on-year.

LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat’s for-hire attacks prevail

3/17

The three ransomware families that laid claim to the highest numbers of successful attacks in
the first quarter of 2022 were all widely known for operating under the RaaS model. Based
on data from the leak sites of their operators, 35.8% of these attacks were attributed to
LockBit, while 19% belonged to Conti and 9.6% to BlackCat.

Based on our ransomware data, which tracked detections of ransomware attempts to
compromise organizations, LockBit and Conti were among the top 10 families detected in the
entire first quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, BlackCat was among the top 10 ransomware families
detected in February and March 2022.

Of the three, only Conti was among the top active ransomware families in the first quarter of
2021, based on RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites. In fact, Conti was first among them in
that period, racking up a victim count of 105. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
estimates that the group behind Conti, which Trend Micro tracks as Water Goblin, has
amassed more than 1,000 victims and payouts amounting to over US$150 million as of
January 2022, making it one of the costliest ransomware families ever documented.
RaaS providers like LockBit, detections of which were at their highest in the first quarter of
2022 in February, have become an even more formidable threat since incorporating double
extortion in their playbooks. Under double extortion, ransomware actors not only encrypt
5/17

their victims’ data and demand payment in exchange for restoration of access, but they also
put additional pressure on victims by threatening to release the data if the ransom is not
paid. LockBit operators relied on this tactic after they took credit for an attack on France’s
Ministry of Justice in January 2022, threatening to publish sensitive ministry data on the dark
web upon failure of payment.
Relative to Conti and LockBit, BlackCat (aka AlphaVM, AlphaV, or ALPHV) is a newcomer; it
was first reported in November 2021 by researchers from MalwareHunterTeam. But what
sets it apart from many other RaaS operators is its use of triple extortion, a tactic where
ransomware actors threaten to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their
victims’ infrastructure on top of leaking their data unless the ransom is paid. BlackCat
demands millions of US dollars in bitcoin or monero from its victims. It is shaping up to be a
major contender in the underground marketplace, thanks to its generous payouts to its RaaS
affiliates, who can earn as much as 90% of paid ransoms.
BlackCat, which our detections showed was most active in the first quarter of 2022 in
February, has successfully compromised at least 60 organizations around the world as of
March. BlackCat is also notable for being the first professional ransomware family to be
written in Rust. This is a major selling point for BlackCat, as Rust is considered a more
secure programming language that is capable of concurrent processing. As a cross-platform
language, Rust also makes it easier for threat actors to tailor malware to different operating
systems like Windows and Linux.

Ransomware attackers set their sights on small and medium-size
businesses
Small businesses are often subjected to a huge volume of cyberattacks because malicious
actors believe that they have fewer resources to counter cyberthreats, while medium-size
ones make compelling targets because they possess comparatively valuable assets.
According to its leak site data, Conti staged attacks primarily on medium-size organizations
(with 201 to 1,000 employees), accounting for 41.9% of its successful attacks in the first
quarter of 2022, with the rest of its attacks evenly split between small businesses (with at
most 200 employees) and large enterprises (with more than 1,000 employees).
In contrast, 65.5% of LockBit’s successful attacks in the first quarter of 2022 affected small
businesses, followed by medium-size companies at 20.5% and large enterprises at 10.5%.
Similarly, BlackCat victimized mostly small businesses in the first quarter of 2022, making up
57.6% of its successful attacks, with medium-size organizations and large enterprises
constituting 25.4% and 17%, respectively.

Government, finance, and manufacturing industries grapple with
onslaught of attacks
7/17

Our telemetry showed that government agencies and financial companies consistently
ranked in the top three industries in terms of ransomware file detections from January to
March 2022, followed by organizations in the manufacturing and fast-moving consumer
goods (FMCG) industries. Ransomware actors continued to beset government organizations,
which also contended with high quantities of ransomware detections in the fourth quarter of
2021.

month of the first quarter of 2022

Organizations in finance and IT remained common targets of RaaS and extortion groups. In
a repeat of the first quarter of last year, ransomware groups’ leak sites showed that these
two industries sustained the most attacks in the first quarter of 2022. Ransomware groups
have typically been drawn to financial companies not only for their valuable data, but also
because their attack surface continues to expand as a result of increased connectivity and a
more distributed workforce.

Our detections were more or less consistent with our findings from ransomware groups’ leak
sites, where financial organizations bore the brunt — 12.7% — of LockBit’s successful
attacks in the first quarter of 2022. The construction and manufacturing industries each made
up 9.5% of LockBit’s victim count in the same period. This count included one of the world’s
largest tire manufacturers, which LockBit compromised in February.

In comparison, Conti’s victims in the first quarter of 2022 were more varied: 12.8% of them
were involved in manufacturing, with materials and professional services companies running
close behind at 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively. One notable Conti attack occurred in January,
against a Taiwanese electronics company that supplies components to the likes of Apple,
Dell, and Tesla. Fortunately, only noncritical systems were affected, but the company’s highprofile clientele gives an idea of how ransomware attacks have the potential to also affect a
victim’s big-name clients.

Organizations in the professional services industry were hit hardest by BlackCat in the first
quarter of 2022, as they were the victims in 13.6% of its successful attacks. Additionally, the
finance and legal services industries each experienced 10.2% of BlackCat’s successful
attacks. One organization that fell victim to BlackCat’s activity was a Swiss aviation business,
which suffered a data leak in February that included the company’s internal memos and
information on job applicants.

Ransomware takes a toll on organizations in Europe and North
America
Our investigation into RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites showed that the US still topped
the list of countries that suffered the most RaaS and extortion attacks, but many European
countries were also affected.

The bulk — 40.5% — of LockBit’s victims in the first quarter of 2022 were organizations
located in Europe, followed by those in North America at 34.1% and those in Asia-Pacific at
10.9%. In particular, the US, Italy, and France experienced the most LockBit attacks. Even
though most of LockBit’s victims were based in Europe, the FBI noted in February that
LockBit’s latest known version, LockBit 2.0, was designed to identify and exclude Eastern
European organizations from its attacks. LockBit’s previous version also had an automated

vetting process that screened out systems in Russia and countries belonging to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, possibly as a means of avoiding prosecution in these
countries.

In February, Conti, which has many members located in Russia, weighed in on the RussiaUkraine conflict and expressed its intent to retaliate against anyone who would stage
cyberattacks on Russia. This might explain, in part, the regional distribution of its activity in
the first quarter of 2022: Organizations in North America were the most affected by its

13/17

successful attacks, making up 49.6% of its victims, whereas those in Europe accounted for
41.9% and those in the Asia-Pacific region made up 6%. Most of Conti’s victims were in the
US, Germany, and the UK.

Like Conti, BlackCat focused its activity in the first quarter of 2022 on victims located in North
America, where 50.8% of its successful attacks took place. Its victims in Europe and AsiaPacific accounted for 25.4% and 18.6%, respectively. More specifically, it homed in on
targets in the US and Italy. In the first quarter of 2022, BlackCat was responsible for
headline-making attacks on prominent European companies, including a German fuel
distribution firm and an Italian high-end fashion brand.

Security solutions and practices safeguard organizations against
ransomware attacks
Ransomware remains a major threat to businesses of all sizes, which must contend with
malicious actors wielding an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques.
Organizations can mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks that could compromise their data
by following these recommended security practices:
Enable multifactor authentication. Organizations should have policies in place that
require employees who access or store company data on their devices to enable
multifactor authentication, so that any sensitive information in these devices cannot be
easily accessed.
Back up data. As much as possible, organizations should follow the “3-2-1 rule” to
protect their important files: Create at least three backup copies in two different file
formats, with one of those copies stored off-site.

15/17

Keep systems up to date. Organizations should update all of their applications,
operating systems, and other software as soon as patches are released by vendors
and developers. Doing so can help prevent ransomware actors from exploiting
vulnerabilities to gain access to organizations’ systems.
Verify emails before opening them. Organizations should train their employees to
avoid downloading attachments or clicking on embedded links in emails from senders
they do not recognize, as malicious actors bank on these as means to install
ransomware.
Follow established security frameworks. Organizations can develop cybersecurity
strategies based on the security frameworks created by the Center of Internet Security
(CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The security
measures and best practices laid out in these frameworks can serve as a guide for
organizations’ security teams as they design their own threat mitigation plans.
Organizations can augment their cybersecurity infrastructure with multilayered detection and
response solutions that can anticipate and respond to ransomware movements before
operators can carry out an attack. One such solution is Trend Micro Vision One™, which is
equipped with extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities that gather and
automatically correlate data across multiple security layers — including email, endpoints,
servers, cloud workloads, and networks — to avert ransomware attack attempts.
Organizations can also benefit from solutions with network detection and response (NDR)
capabilities, which can give them greater visibility over their network traffic. Among these
solutions is Trend Micro Network One™, which provides security teams with the critical
network telemetry they need to form a clearer picture of their environment, accelerate their
response, and prevent future attacks.
