Analysis of campaign
Group-IB analysts for the first time detected activities of a cybercriminal group that was
subsequently dubbed GrelosGTM by our Threat Intelligence team in early April 2020, but the
earliest sample associated with this group dates back to January 2020. Since the beginning
of their attacks the group had two distinctive features: they preferred to use multi-stage
JavaScript malware and files without extension or with .css extension for storing code of
their JavaScript sniffers.

In their first attacks on e-commerce websites, this group used domains, which impersonated
legitimate services like Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. One year later, in April
2021, Group-IB specialists detected that apart from using domains mimicking the services,
GrelosGTM group started to abuse Google Tag Manager legitimate functionality for their own
purposes in infections of online shops.
Analysis of attacks
This specific campaign started in February 2021 and affected at least seven websites
running CMS Magento in Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. At the
time of the publication, the JS sniffer has been active on at least four websites. Group-IB
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB) has informed all the websites infected of
the incident.
For the initial stage of infection GrelosGTM group injected their own Google Tag Manager
scripts to the source code of targeted websites. In most cases attackers used a direct link to
the script located on legitimate googletagmanager.com domain, but in some infections they
used an injector as shown on Figure 1.

created by hackers
This Google Tag Manager script (Figure 2) contains malicious inject, which loads the next
stage script from the attacker's website by URL hXXs://webfaset[.]com/str.css.

Injected script is responsible for detecting the checkout page using regular expression and
for downloading the main payload of JS sniffer using WebSocket from URL
wss://webfaset[.]com:80/bootstrap.min.css (Figure 3).

The final payload is a heavily obfuscated JavaScript sniffer designed for collecting shoppers'
bank card information during checkout using a fake payment form. All collected cards will be
sent to attackers' server via gate hXXs://webfaset[.]com/media/logo.img.
