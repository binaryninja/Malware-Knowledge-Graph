Honestly I couldn't decide between the title above and "All crimes are paid", but Sex Pistols
fans will get it regardless Â¯\(ãƒ„)/Â¯
I found this sample while browsing the new public submissions on AnyRun on the 1st of
December. It peaked my interest because there were just three samples of it on the platform
at the time of writing this and they were all uploaded very recently.

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

As always one of my go to tools is DetectItEasy. In this case it tells us that we are dealing
with a .NET Application and you know what that means: Let's whip out the .NET Analysis VM
and take a look.

This looks pretty promising. Because .NET Code is not compiled to Machine Language
directly but rather to the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) just in time we can inspect it
without the need for a disassembler with Telerik JustDecompile or dnSpy.

Looking at the Output it looks like we have a Powershell Script in front of us that has been
run through PS2EXE, a kind of "converter" (a wrapper to be more precise) for ps1 scripts to
PE executables.

Decoding the Base64 string we got from the binary gets us two more blocks of what looks
like base64 strings and a few lines of PowerShell code between it.

Decompressing one of the gzip blocks yields us a Portable Executable!

The dropped .SaveTheQueen.LOG was found in C:\ProgramData\. SaveTheQueen does
not leave a ransomnote or other information to contact the crooks.

Because the Registry edits resemble something seen before in LockerGoga I'd like to make
a short comparison between the two stains.

A new variant of the SaveTheQueen Ransomware was found the MalwareHunterTeam. I'll
update this article asap.

The SaveTheQueen ransomware is

The ransomware sample -> ConfuserEx -> shellcode -> embed in C# injector dll
(base64 encoded) -> PowerShell script (base64 + GZip) -> PS2EXE - and not even
sure if that's all...@demonslay335
