APT GROUPS, CYBERCRIMINALS
AND THE NEED FOR RESILIENT
IT SECURITY FOR GOVERNMENT

INTRODUCTION
Despite the pitfalls in making predictions during a pandemic, we can be confident
cyber-risks for government bodies will continue to grow, evolve, and require
even greater focus and resources to mitigate. Government, like industry, is
facing the fact that its productivity tools are being turned against its interests
and its ability to protect and provide essential services, ensure economic stability,
and even maintain cultural and societal cohesion.
The path to “digital by default”
Of course, these heightened risks come at a time
when government bodies and businesses are still
navigating a course through the coronavirus
pandemic, adding to what is already a complex
operating environment for those responsible for IT
infrastructure and security. While there are
differences between the functions of different
government bodies, the overall trend is that the
attack surface is expanding. This is reinforced by the
fact that government bodies are edging toward
digital services that are so straightforward and
convenient that all those who can use them will

APT ATTACKS IN EUROPE:
A GROWING MENACE TO
GOVERNMENT

Do the past half year’s attention-grabbing attacks conducted by APT groups
signal business as usual, or an emerging trend in supply-chain attacks?
In the past six months, a rash of notable advanced
persistent threat (APT) attacks have been revealed,
targeting countries across the European continent,
from France to Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and
across verticals, from government and military
entities to private companies.
An example of APT activity discovered by ESET is

backdoor and document stealer belonging to the
infamous Turla APT group. ESET researchers saw

arsenal through 2020.
In the following text, we’ll take a closer look at two
other examples: XDSpy, an APT group that managed
to stay under the radar for nine years, and Sandworm,
which is one of the most dangerous APT groups
in operation.
We’ll also discuss the role supply-chain attacks play in
the arsenals of various threat actors, a subject that has
been grabbing even more attention than usual since
the SolarWinds hack made international headlines.

IT SECURITY AND
GOVERNMENT: PARALLELS
BETWEEN TARGETED
INSTITUTIONS

To be CISO of a cybersecurity company is to be in a unique position. And, while
there is inherent benefit in working with a board that intrinsically understands
the technical aspects of security, cybersecurity companies are no less a target
(indeed, they could be a prize) for cybercriminals. This second point, knowing
we are a target, is where I believe our experience most strongly intersects with
that of government organizations. This key point has remained constant over
my 10 years as CISO at ESET and is a main driver in evolving our security posture
to meet the ever-changing demands of the online environment.
The reality of our status as a target also has strong
relevance to our company’s security culture, growth
and business model. Governments face a similar
challenge. They are clear targets, their adversaries
will not be readily eliminated, and mitigation of the
worst symptoms of the tactics and techniques found
on the threatscape dictate everything from security
policy and resource allocation to culture and
strategic growth.
Questions about how to evolve can be answered
both from the point of view of ESET and from that
of the wider information security world. Since I am
more intimately acquainted with ESET, it is far easier

Daniel Chromek
CISO/Section Lead

to address the “how” from that perspective. ESET is
a company whose business has grown quite
dramatically during my tenure. On the other hand,
it is a close-knit community in which a lot of activities
needed standardization and a proper governance
framework in order to streamline internal processes,

EMISSARYSOLDIER: MALICIOUS
ACTIVITIES OF LUCKYMOUSE
APT GROUP IN 2020

LuckyMouse has compromised government networks and private companies
(telco, media and banks) in Central Asia and the Middle East
LuckyMouse, also known as APT27 and Emissary
Panda, is a cyberespionage group that is best known
for its regular use of watering hole, or strategic web
compromise, attacks. The group has breached not
only multiple government networks in Central Asia
and the Middle East, but also transnational
organizations such as the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO).
In its latest analysis of LuckyMouse, ESET Research
discovered a set of malicious activities that took
place in 2020 and in which the operators mainly
used the SysUpdate (aka Soldier) toolkit. ESET has
named this set of activities EmissarySoldier.

Matthieu Faou
Malware Researcher

In order to compromise victims, LuckyMouse
typically uses watering holes, compromising
websites likely to be visited by its intended targets.
LuckyMouse operators also perform network scans
to find vulnerable internet-facing servers run by
their intended victims. While the group generally
uses already known exploits to compromise
unpatched servers, ESET saw LuckyMouse among
the threat groups likely leveraging the Microsoft
Exchange vulnerabilities while they were still zero
days to conduct attacks on email servers.

REGULATORY RADAR:
CRITICAL CUES FOR
CYBERSECURITY POSTURE IN
THE EU AND US

Society’s reliance on technology, and the emergence of those who seek to misuse
it, have led to increasing attempts by governments around the globe to regulate
cyberspace. In doing so, governments are broadly attempting to deter bad
actors, both state-sponsored and criminal, through powers to pursue and levy
penalties; protect critical national infrastructure, personal information, security
and defense assets; and build societal resilience by ensuring government bodies,
businesses and other organizations recognize their responsibilities and are held
accountable. In parallel, governments aim to educate citizens as to the scope
of cybersecurity risks and needed mitigations.
At a supranational level, the United Nations is trying
to secure agreement on the application of international
law to state activity and build on 11 norms of responsible
behavior in cyberspace agreed in 2015. The European
Union’s 2018 GDPR regulation quickly became
a reference point for countries seeking to strengthen
privacy and security regulation. Both the EU and US
(under the new Biden administration) are expected to
set the tone for the increased regulation of cyberspace
in the years ahead.

Andy Garth
Government Affairs Lead

In the absence of a global standard or agreement, the
regulatory picture is rather fragmented. Presently,
regulation is predominately driven at the national, state
and industry sector levels. This fact, combined with
the pace of innovation and legislative complexities, has
left most governments with palpable security
challenges and many struggling to keep up.

ENDPOINT DETECTION
AND RESPONSE:
A COUNTERBALANCE TO
PERSISTENT THREATS

Large organizations and government institutions, such as ministries of foreign
affairs, embassies and other diplomatic representatives, are prime targets for
espionage operations. Threat actors target these institutions in various ways
to steal sensitive information. Stealth is an essential part of these malicious
campaigns because remaining unseen and undetected in a target network for
as long as possible is key for success.
