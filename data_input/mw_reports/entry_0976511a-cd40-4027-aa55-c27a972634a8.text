• Priority #1 post-exploitation
• Domain admin is ultimate goal

• Nearly everything in Windows is tied to an account
• Difficult to move without one

• Easy and relatively stealthy means to traverse the network
• Account limitations are rare

• “Sleeper” credentials can provide access after remediation

Compromising Credentials: Hashes

Hashes
Tokens

Credentials
LSA Secrets
Tickets

NTDS.DIT

The password for each user account in Windows is stored in
multiple formats: LM and NT hashes are most well known.
TsPkg, WDigest, and LiveSSP can be decrypted to
provide plaintext passwords (prior to Win8.1)
How are they acquired and used? Hashes are available
in the LSASS process and can be extracted with admin
privileges. Once dumped, hashes can be cracked or used
immediately in a Pass the Hash attack.
Common tools: Mimikatz • fgdump • gsecdump •
Metasploit • SMBshell • PWDumpX • creddump • WCE

Defending Credentials: Hashes

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Stop remote interactive sessions with highly
privileged accounts
• Proper termination of RDP sessions
• Win8.1+  force the use of Restricted Admin?
• Win10  deploy Remote Credential Guard

• Upgrade to Windows 10
• Credential Guard
• TsPkg, WDigest, etc. -- SSO creds obsolescence
• Domain Protected Users Group (PtH mitigation)

Credentials

Tickets

NTDS.DIT

Delegate tokens are powerful authentication resources
used for SSO. They allow attackers to impersonate a
user’s security context, including over the network.
How are they acquired and used? The
SeImpersonate privilege lets tokens be copied from
processes. The new token can then be used to
authenticate as the new user. A target user or service
must be logged on or have running processes.
Common tools: Incognito • Metasploit • PowerShell
• Mimikatz

Defending Credentials:Tokens

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Stop remote interactive sessions with highly
privileged accounts
• Proper termination of RDP sessions
• Win8.1+  force the use of Restricted Admin Mode?
• Win10  deploy Remote Credential Guard

• Account designation of “Account is Sensitive and
Cannot be Delegated” in Active Directory
• Domain Protected Users security group accounts do
not create delegate tokens
16

Compromising Credentials: Cached Credentials

Hashes
Tokens
Cached
Credentials
LSA Secrets
Tickets

NTDS.DIT

Stored domain credentials to allow logons when
domain controller access is unavailable. Most systems
cache the last 10 logon hashes by default.
How are they acquired and used? Cached
credentials must be cracked. Hashes are salted and
case-sensitive, making decryption very slow. These
hashes cannot be used for Pass the Hash attacks.
Common tools: cachedump • Metasploit
• PWDumpX • creddump
17

Offline Cached Credentials Extraction (Creddump)
Local NT Hashes

Cached Hashes

The creddump utilities can extract hashes, cached credentials and LSA Secrets from offline registry hives:
github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7
18

Defending Credentials: Cached Credentials

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Limit number of cached logon accounts
• SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Winlogon
(cachedlogonscount value)
• A cachedlogonscount of zero or one is not always the right answer

• Enforce password length and complexity rules
• Brute force cracking is required for this attack

• Domain Protected Users security group accounts do
not cache credentials
20

Compromising Credentials: LSA Secrets

Hashes
Tokens
Cached
Credentials
LSA Secrets

Tickets
NTDS.DIT

Credentials stored in the registry to allow services or
tasks to be run with user privileges. In addition to
service accounts, may also hold application
passwords like VPN or auto-logon credentials.
How are they acquired and used? Administrator
privileges allow access to encrypted registry data and
the keys necessary to decrypt. Passwords are plaintext

Common tools: Cain • Metasploit •

Mimikatz
• gsecdump • PWDumpX • creddump • PowerShell

21

Decrypting LSA Secrets (Nishang)

Get-LsaSecret.ps1 from the Nishang PowerShell
pentest framework used to dump (and decrypt) LSA

22

Defending Credentials: LSA Secrets

• Prevent admin account compromise
• Do not employ services or schedule tasks
requiring privileged accounts on low trust systems

• Reduce number of services that require domain
accounts to execute
• Heavily audit any accounts that must be used

• (Group) Managed Service Accounts
23

Compromising Credentials: Tickets

Hashes
Tokens

Credentials

Tickets
NTDS.DIT

Kerberos issues tickets to authenticated users that can
be reused without additional authentication. Tickets
are cached in memory and are valid for 10 hours.
How are they acquired and used? Tickets can be
stolen from memory and used to authenticate
elsewhere (Pass the Ticket). Further, access to the DC
allows tickets to be created for any user with no
expiration (Golden Ticket). Service account tickets can
be requested and forged, including offline cracking of
service account hashes (Kerberoasting).

Common tools: Mimikatz • WCE • kerberoast
24

Pass the Ticket (Mimikatz)

25

Kerberos Attacks
Pass the Ticket

Steal ticket from memory and pass or import on
other systems

Overpass the Hash Use NT hash to request a service ticket for the same
account
Kerberoasting

Request service ticket for highly privileged service &
crack NT hash

Golden Ticket

Kerberos TGT for any account with no expiration.
Survives full password reset

Silver Ticket

All-access pass for a single service or computer

Skeleton Key

Patch LSASS on domain controller to add backdoor
password that works for any domain account
27

Defending Credentials:Tickets

• Credential Guard (Win10+)
• Domain Protected Users Group (Win8+) – Some attacks

• Remote Credential Guard (Win10+)
• Restricted Admin (Win8+)

• Long & complex passwords on service accounts (to
prevent Kerberoasting)
• Change service account passwords regularly
• Group Managed Service Accounts are a great mitigation

• Audit service accounts for unusual activity
• Change KRBTGT password regularly (yearly)

NTDS.DIT

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) database holds
all user and computer account hashes (LM/NT) in the
domain. Encrypted, but algorithm is well known and easy
to defeat.
How is it acquired and used? Located in the
\Windows\NTDS folder on the domain controller. The
file is locked, so admin access is required to load a driver to
access raw disk, or use the Volume Shadow Copy Service.

Credential Attack Detection

33

“As any pass-the-ticket attack, the attacker replays
the golden ticket in a standard Kerberos protocol.
Therefore, there is no clear indication of such attack
in Windows logs.”

34

“Golden Ticket events may have one of these issues:
The Account Domain field is blank when it should
be DOMAIN
The Account Domain field is DOMAIN FQDN when it
should be DOMAIN.” –Sean Metcalf, adsecurity.org

35

As an example…

Kerberoasting
uses RC4
encryption
downgrade
(but almost no
one logs these
events)

Credential Best Practices

49

Best Practices: Control Your Admin Accounts

Restrict and Protect Privileged Domain Accounts
• Reduce the number of Domain/Enterprise Admins
• Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all network
and cloud admin accounts
• Separate administrative accounts from user accounts for
administrative personnel
• Create specific administrative workstation hosts for
administrators
• Use the Domain Protected Users security group!

50

Best Practices: Control Your Admin Accounts (2)

Limit Local Admin Accounts
• Don’t give users admin
• Unique and complex
passwords for local admin
(LAPS)
• Deny network logons for
local accounts

Audit account usage and
monitor for anomalies

51

Best Practices: Control Your Admin Accounts (3)

Use a Tiered Administrative Access Model
• Administration of AD
• Servers and Applications
• Workstations and Devices

Corey Plett (Microsoft)
52

Best Practices: Reduce the Credential Attack Surface

• Audit and limit the number of services running as
system and domain accounts
• Utilize Group Managed Service Accounts
• … or regularly change and use long & complex passwords

• Upgrade to Windows 10 /Server 2016
• Enable Credential Guard & Remote Credential Guard

• Force LSASS as protected process on legacy Win8.1
• Establish remote connections using network logon
instead of interactive logon when possible
53

Best Practices: Reduce the Credential Attack Surface (2)

• Limit workstation to workstation communication
• Restrict inbound NetBIOS, SMB traffic using the Windows
Firewall
• … or VLAN segmentation of workstations
• So many hack tools leverage SMB authentication
• Is workstation to workstation RDP really necessary?

• Enable stricter Kerberos security
• Disable LM & NTLM (force Kerberos)
• Short validity for tickets
• No account delegation
