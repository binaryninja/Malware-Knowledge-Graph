PhishLabs has observed a spike in malicious emails distributing ZLoader malware. The spike is notably one of the greatest upticks for a single
payload observed in a 24-hour period over the past year, and is the first significant sign that another botnet may be stepping up in the
aftermath of the Emotet takedown.

ZLoader is one of the most frequently reported malware strains since June 2020. This particular campaign uses three legitimate file sharing
platforms to distribute attacks: WeTransfer, Google Docs, and box.com. Emails are delivered through a variety of compromised accounts. The
payload is delivered via malicious files and download links.

WeTransfer Example
WeTransfer Sender Address: [email protected]
WeTransfer Subject Line: sent you files via WeTransfer
WeTransfer URL:
