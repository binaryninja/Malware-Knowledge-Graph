Note: Tool informs that encrypted files extension, for the current PC, should be *.e392d905,
please check that you have encrypted files, with this extension, otherwise no files will be
decrypted.
Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you want to search for all encrypted files or just add the
path to where you previously saved the encrypted files.
We strongly recommend that you also select “Backup files” before starting the decryption process

If you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.
If you checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files. You
can also find a log describing decryption process, in %temp%\BDRemovalTool folder:

To get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and
remove them bulk. We do not encourage you to do this, unless you doubled check your files can
be opened safely and there is no trace of damage.

Ransomware in some cases encrypts files incorrectly so that decryption will not work properly,
we recommend that you back up your files before using the decryption tool if you have not already
checked the option "backup files " from decryption tool.
