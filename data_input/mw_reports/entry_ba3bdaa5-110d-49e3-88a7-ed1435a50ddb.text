Repackaging Open Source BeEF for Tracking and More
BeEF Wrapped Up and Delivered in 2016
In late February 2016, a University website in Iran stood out for thoroughly vetting its current
and potential students and staff. The University’s web site served repackaged content from
the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) with embedded JavaScript content maintaining
the potential to hook visitors’ web browsers, identify visited websites and domains, explore
for vulnerabilities (we did not observe any auto-pwning), and provide tracking through
evercookies. Even a partial listing of visited sites can be sensitive and valuable information,
and this sort of “sites visited” data gathering via other techniques, like screengrabbing and
keylogging, were observed in past APT incidents like the Madi campaigns. Currently, it’s
advisable to avoid the site.

The embedded BeEF content appears not to be fully configured, and only partially
implemented. Perhaps a limited data set was of interest for this attacker, or this was an early
attempt at deploying BeEF.
This incident is interesting because at the same time and a bit earlier, another group was
heavily relying on repackaging open source offensive security product in their toolset by
deploying both BeEF and Metasploit-produced components across a select set of strategic
web compromises. This particular APT has years of low-tech elaborate social engineering
schemes and re-purposed open source efforts under its belt.

While we call them the NewsBeef APT, they have been reported in the past as Charming
Kitten or Newscaster in 2014, social engineering their way into sensitive circles of trust with
spoofed LinkedIn profiles and phony news media organizations.
They continue to be highly active, but this time, they are using a slightly more technical
toolset. On one hand, they have developed skills or discovered tools to compromise select
web applications and sites, supporting their watering hole campaigns. On the other hand,
they have repackaged leaked bot source code and repackaged open source Metasploit and
PowerSploit components to produce and administer backdoors and downloaders.
Newsbeef/Newscaster will find a way to compromise a web site, usually the vulnerability
appears to be CMS related, in an outdated WordPress plugin, Joomla version, or Drupal
version. Attackers usually perform one of two things, Newsbeef has been performing the first
of the two:
inject a src or iframe link into web pages or css sheets
inject the content of an entire BeEF web page into one of the internally linked javascript
helpers
The injected link will redirect visitors’ browsers to a BeEF server. Usually, the attackers
deliver some of the tracking and system/browser identification and evercookie capabilities.
Sometimes, it appears that they deliver the metasploit integration to exploit and deliver
backdoors (we haven’t identified that exploitation activity in our ksn data related to this group
just yet). Sometimes, it is used to pop up spoofed login input fields to steal social networking

site credentials. We also haven’t detected that in ksn, but some partners have privately
reported it about various incidents. But we have identified that attackers will redirect
specific targets to laced Adobe Flash and other installers from websites that they operate.
So, the watering hole activity isn’t always and usually isn’t delivering backdoors. Most of the
time, the watering hole injections are used to identify and track visitors or steal their browser
history. Then, they deliver the backdoors to the right targets.
In addition to the University site and the NewsBeef APT, in the past couple of months, we
identified a variety of compromised sites around the world serving the BeEF. Most are
cleaned up. Deployments to interesting and strategic web sites and their true reach on a
global scale appears to be on the increase:
Middle eastern embassy in the Russian Federation
Indian military technology school
High conflict regional presidency
Ukrainian ICS Scanner mirror
European Union education diversification support agency
Russian foreign trade management organization
Progressive Kazakh news and politics media
Turkish news organization
Specialized German music school
Japanese textile manufacturing inspection corporate division
Middle Eastern social responsibility and philanthropy
surprisingly popular British “lifestyle” blog
Algerian University’s online course platform
Chinese construction group
Russian overseas business development and holding company
Russian gaming developer forum
Romanian Steam gaming developer
Chinese online gaming virtual gold seller
Brazilian music instrument retailer
BeEF Capabilities
Key to these incidents are the development, distribution, and ease of use of toolkits like
BeEF.

BeEF itself is an open source collection of tools and tricks, some years old, that combined
together can effectively hook a visiting web browser for evaluation and full exploitation.
Because of its capabilities, we have seen increased adoption of the framework for the past
year or so.
Browser enumeration and reporting
Plugin enumeration and reporting
Retrieve visited domains (based on an old browser cache fetch timing trick)
Social engineering via live sessions and phishing within the browser
Network exploration, discovery, and exfiltration tunneling
Metasploit exploit integration and autopwning
Evercookie deployment for persistent tracking – multiple platforms
XSS evaluation and exploitation
At the same time, many of the techniques implemented are very old and public. The kit is
extensible, customizable, and integrates with metasploit for autopwnage. Some of the
techniques were discussed during Jeremiah Grossman’s 2006 Black Hat conference
presentation. The delay in deployment for techniques of this type indicates that some teams
are dependent on open source tool packaging and ease of use. We have seen this sort of
reliance on both open source offensive toolkits and legitimate software in the past from APT
like Crouching Yeti, TeamSpy, and now the Newsbeef.
Fighting against the use of browser hooking frameworks for identification, tracking, live
session social engineering, and precision and auto-exploitation effectively requires a mix of
technologies. When these JavaScript-based frameworks are used in a malicious manner, the
combination of network and host based detection is required to fully handle more
serious incidents.
Unfortunately, these incidents are on the increase. You can disable JavaScript in your own
browser with NoScript, but that’s much like just moving to Lynx or a text-based browser –
people don’t want that because it kills functionality in the browser they do want. A Chrome
plugin that detects the BeEF cookie is easily evaded by serious players. And preventing the
tracking methods altogether is another whole ball of wax, because much of the functionality
is tied into legitimate web pages by third party marketers and retailers.
Preventing the social engineering sessions for credential theft and Metasploit exploit
integration makes immediate sense and can be incorporated at the network and more
effectively at the host level. AntiAPT can help wipe out most of an operation on the network
at scale, but these measures can be evaded as well. In other words, dealing with a
determined attacker using tools like this one is difficult.
