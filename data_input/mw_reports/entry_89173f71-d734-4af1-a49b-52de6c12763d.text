Sea Turtle keeps on swimming, ﬁnds new victims, DNS
hijacking techniques

By Danny Adamitis with contributions from Paul Rascagneres.

Executive summary
After several months of activity, the actors behind the "Sea Turtle" DNS hijacking
campaign are not slowing down. Cisco Talos recently discovered new details that
suggest they regrouped after we published our initial ﬁndings and coverage and are
redoubling their efforts with new infrastructure. While many actors will slow down once
they are discovered, this group appears to be unusually brazen, and will be unlikely to
be deterred going forward.
Additionally, we discovered a new DNS hijacking technique that we assess with
moderate conﬁdence is connected to the actors behind Sea Turtle. This new technique
is similar in that the threat actors compromise the name server records and respond to
DNS requests with falsiﬁed A records. This new technique has only been observed in a
few highly targeted operations. We also identiﬁed a new wave of victims, including a
country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry, which manages the DNS records for
every domain uses that particular country code, that access was used to then
compromise additional government entities. Unfortunately, unless there are signiﬁcant
changes made to better secure DNS, these sorts of attacks are going to remain
prevalent.

Talos now has moderate conﬁdence that the threat actors behind Sea Turtle have been
using another DNS hijacking technique. This new technique has been used very
sparingly, and thus far have only identiﬁed two entities that were targeted in 2018,
though we believe there are likely more.
This new technique once again involved modifying the target domain's name server
records to point legitimate users to the actor-controlled server. In this case, the actorcontrolled name server and the hijacked hostnames would both resolve to the same IP
address for a short period of time, typically less than 24 hours. In both observed cases,
one of the hijacked hostnames would reference an email service and the threat actors
would presumably harvest user credentials. One aspect of this technique that makes it
extremely difﬁcult to track is that the actor-controlled name servers were not used across
multiple targets — meaning that every entity hijacked with this technique had its own
dedicated name server hostname and its own dedicated IP address. Whereas previously
reported name server domains such as ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com were used to target
multiple organizations.
In one case, a private organization primarily used a third-party service as their
authoritative name server. Then, for a three-hour window in January 2018, their name
server records were changed to a name server hostname that mimicked a slightly
different version of the organization's name. During that three-hour window, the actorcontrolled IP address hosted three hostnames, the two actor-controlled name servers
and the webmail hostname. This would allow the threat actors to perform a man-in-themiddle (MitM) attack, as outlined in our previous post, and harvest credentials. This
technique was also observed against a government organizations in the Middle East and
North African region.

Continued activity against ccTLD
The Institute of Computer Science of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-Forth), the ccTLD for Greece, acknowledged on its public website that its
network had been compromised on April 19, 2019. Based on Cisco telemetry, we
determined that the actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign had access to the ICS-Forth
network.
Cisco telemetry conﬁrmed that the actors behind Sea Turtle maintained access to the
ICS-Forth network from an operational command and control (C2) node. Our telemetry
indicates that the actors maintained access in the ICS-Forth network through at least
April 24, ﬁve days after the statement was publicly released. Upon analysis of this
operational C2 node, we determined that it was also used to access an organization in
Syria that was previously redirected using the actor-controlled name server
ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com. This indicates that the same threat actors were behind both
operations.
We also saw evidence that the threat actors researched the open-source tool PHPProxy. Notably, this particular C2 node searched for both blog.talosintelligence.com and
ncsc.gov.uk, presumably to view Talos' previous reports on DNS hijacking and this DNS
hijacking advisory from the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre.

New actor-controlled nameserver
We recently discovered a new actor-controlled nameserver, rootdnservers[.]com, that
exhibited similar behavior patterns as name servers previously utilized as part of the Sea
Turtle campaign. The domain rootdnservers[.]com was registered on April 5, 2019
through the registrar NameCheap. The new actor-controlled name server
rootdnservers[.]com was utilized to perform DNS hijacking against three government
entities that all used .gr, the Greek ccTLD. It's likely that these hijackings were performed
through the access the threat actors obtained in the ICS-Forth network. Below is a table
showing the three most recent actor-controlled name servers that we have associated
with this activity and their current operational status.

New IP addresses associated with man-in-the-middle activity
By identifying the targeted domains, we were able to identify the hijacked hostnames
and the corresponding actor-controlled MitM nodes. The threat actors, again employing
previously documented tradecraft, by performing a "certiﬁcate impersonation" technique.
This is where the threat actors procure an SSL certiﬁcate for the targeted hostname from
a different SSL provider. Below is a table showing the dates and associated IP
addresses.

Since our initial report, Sea Turtle has continued to compromise a number of different
entities to fulﬁll their requirements. We have identiﬁed some of the new primary targets
as:
Government organizations
Energy companies
Think tanks
International non-governmental organizations
At least one airport
In terms of secondary targets, we have seen very similar targets as those previously
reported, such as telecommunications providers, internet service providers and one
registry.

Coverage and mitigations
In order to best protect against this type of attack, we compiled a list of potential actions.
We have included additional security recommendations, that were highlighted by Bill
Woodcock during his presentations on DNS/IMAP attacks.
We recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, such as DUO, to secure
the management of your organization's DNS records at your registrar, and to
connect remotely to your corporate network via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Talos suggests a registry lock service on your domain names, which will require
the registrar to provide an out-of-band conﬁrmation before the registry will process
any changes to an organization's DNS record.
DNSSEC sign your domains, either in-house, or using a DNS service provider
which performs DNSSEC key-management services.
DNSSEC validate all DNS lookups in your recursive resolver, either using in-house
nameservers, or a service like Cisco Umbrella / OpenDNS.
Make Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) email servers accessible only
from your corporate LAN and to users who have already authenticated over a
VPN.
If you suspect you were targeted by this type of activity, we recommend instituting
a network-wide password reset, preferably from a computer on a trusted network.

Lastly, network administrators can monitor passive DNS record on their domains,
to check for abnormalities.
