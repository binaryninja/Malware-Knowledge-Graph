Introduction
Russian language spam pushing Shade ransomware (also known as Troldesh ransomware)
has remained active since my previous ISC diary about it on 2018-11-29. However,
sometime in February 2019, this malicious spam (malspam) has altered its tactics slightly.
Instead of a zip archive directly attached to the malspam, recent emails have attached PDF
files with links to download the zip archive. Otherwise, this infection activity remains
relatively unchanged.
Details
Malspam pushing Shade has a variety of subjects, spoofed sending addresses, and
message text. The common theme is some sort of order or invoice. The attached PDF files
have links to download an alleged invoice, which was saved as pic.zip when I checked.

1/7

Shown above: From malspam to PDF to downloaded zip archive.
Pic.zip contained a JavaScript (.js) file designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host when
double-clicked. Infection traffic remained similar to previous examples of Shade
ransomware, and my infected Windows host exhibited the expected behavior.

2/7

Shown above: Downloaded zip archive and extracted .js file.

Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.

Final words
As I stated last time, Russian language malspam pushing Shade/Troldesh ransomware is
nothing new. Since I first posted a diary about it back in 2016, it's never disappeared for
long. Nor is this malspam limited to Russian language. An example I documented in 2017
was from English malspam. This diary is yet another reminder the criminals behind this
malware remain active.
