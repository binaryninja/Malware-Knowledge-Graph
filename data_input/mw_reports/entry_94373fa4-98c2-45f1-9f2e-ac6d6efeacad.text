On 6 July 2020 SanSec reported that North Korea APT group dubbed Lazarus/HIDDEN
COBRA, was performing MageCart style attacks against websites[1].
Two mentions in their report are interesting, PaperSource and FocusCamera[1].

The entire North Korea link appears to hinge on a IP reuse for an IP in LeaseWeb which is a
weak link for attribution but sometimes there could be non public details about the incident. The
more interesting aspect to this is some context that we can provide to the story, namely the
connection to TrickBot/Anchor. You may recall that this would not be the first time this
CyberCrime crew has been caught working with Lazarus.
Also interesting from the article “The malware was removed within 24 hours but a week later,
the very same malware resurfaced on the same store.”[1] which would suggest the attackers
had a foothold or “Anchor” into the environment.

This name immediately stood out after reading the SanSec report, it came up during our
previous work revolving around PowerTrick[4] which is the powershell framework developed
and utilized by TrickBot/Anchor actors. The company appears to of been initially breached by
TrickBot around October 2019 and actors then began using PowerTrick to pivot around.

PaperSource
We have reason to believe that PaperSource was also initially TrickBot and later Anchor and
MemScraper which is their POS component of the Anchor Framework previously detailed[5].

PaperSource MemScraper infection
Given these revelations we have two possibilities:
— The SanSec NK attribution is incorrect and TrickBot actors are also interested in leveraging
jsSniffers against victim websites in MageCart style attacks.
— The SanSec NK attribution is correct and this is one more example of Lazarus being
involved in TrickBot infected institutions.
