Malicious Cyber Actors Continue to Exploit
Log4Shell in VMware Horizon Systems
SUMMARY
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) and United States Coast Guard
Cyber Command (CGCYBER) are releasing this
joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn
network defenders that cyber threat actors,
including state-sponsored advanced persistent
threat (APT) actors, have continued to exploit
CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) in VMware
Horizon® and Unified Access Gateway (UAG)
servers to obtain initial access to organizations
that did not apply available patches or
workarounds.

Actions to take today:
• Install fixed builds, updating all affected
VMware Horizon and UAG systems to
the latest versions. If updates or
workarounds were not promptly applied
following VMware’s release of updates
for Log4Shell in December 2021, treat
all affected VMware systems as
compromised.
• Minimize the internet-facing attack
surface by hosting essential services on
a segregated demilitarized (DMZ) zone,
ensuring strict network perimeter access
controls, and implementing regularly
updated web application firewalls
(WAFs) in front of public-facing services.

Since December 2021, multiple threat actor
groups have exploited Log4Shell on unpatched,
public-facing VMware Horizon and UAG
servers. As part of this exploitation, suspected
APT actors implanted loader malware on
compromised systems with embedded executables enabling remote command and control (C2). In
one confirmed compromise, these APT actors were able to move laterally inside the network, gain
access to a disaster recovery network, and collect and exfiltrate sensitive data.
This CSA provides the suspected APT actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs);
information on the loader malware; and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The information is derived
from two related incident response engagements and malware analysis of samples discovered on the
victims’ networks.

CISA and CGCYBER recommend all organizations with affected systems that did not immediately
apply available patches or workarounds to assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities
using the IOCs provided in this CSA, Malware Analysis Report (MAR)-10382580-1, and [MAR10382254-1]. If potential compromise is detected, administrators should apply the incident response
recommendations included in this CSA and report key findings to CISA.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Note: this advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 11. See Appendix A
for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques.
Log4Shell is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Apache® Log4j library and a variety of
products using Log4j, such as consumer and enterprise services, websites, applications, and other
products, including certain versions of VMware Horizon and UAG. The vulnerability enables malicious
cyber actors to submit a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system, causing the system to
execute arbitrary code. The request allows the malicious actors to take full control of the affected
system. (For more information on Log4Shell, see CISA’s Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance
webpage and VMware advisory VMSA-2021-0028.13.)
VMware made fixes available in December 2021 and confirmed exploitation in the wild on
December 10, 2021.[1] Since December 2021, multiple cyber threat actor groups have exploited
[T1190] Log4Shell on unpatched, public-facing VMware Horizon and UAG servers to obtain initial
access [TA0001] to networks.
After obtaining access, some actors implanted loader malware on compromised systems with
embedded executables enabling remote C2. These actors connected to known malicious IP address
104.223.34[.]198.[2] This IP address uses a self-signed certificate CN: WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8. In at
least one confirmed compromise, the actors collected and exfiltrated sensitive information from the
victim’s network.
The sections below provide information CISA and CGCYBER obtained during incident response
activities at two related confirmed compromises.

Victim 1
CGCYBER conducted a proactive threat-hunting engagement at an organization (Victim 1)
compromised by actors exploiting Log4Shell in VMware Horizon. After obtaining access, threat actors
uploaded malware, hmsvc.exe, to a compromised system. During malware installation, connections
to IP address 104.223.34[.]198 were observed.

TLP:WHITE

CISA | CGCYBER

TLP:WHITE
CISA and CGCYBER analyzed a sample of hmsvc.exe from the confirmed compromise. hmsvc.exe
masquerades as a legitimate Microsoft® Windows® service (SysInternals LogonSessions software)
[T1036.004] and appears to be a modified version of SysInternals LogonSessions software
embedded with malicious packed code. When discovered, the analyzed sample of hmsvc.exe was
running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, the highest privilege level on a Windows system. It is unknown
how the actors elevated privileges.
hmsvc.exe is a Windows loader containing an embedded executable, 658_dump_64.exe. The
embedded executable is a remote access tool that provides an array of C2 capabilities, including the
ability to log keystrokes [T1056.001], upload and execute additional payloads [T1105], and provide
graphical user interface (GUI) access over a target Windows system's desktop. The malware can
function as a C2 tunneling proxy [T1090], allowing a remote operator to pivot to other systems and
move further into a network.
When first executed, hmsvc.exe creates the Scheduled Task [T1053.005],
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Local Session Updater, which executes malware every hour.
When executed, two randomly named *.tmp files are written to the disk at the location
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Temp\ and the embedded executable attempts to connect to
hard-coded C2 server 192.95.20[.]8 over port 4443, a non-standard port [TT571]. The executable’s
inbound and outbound communications are encrypted with a 128-bit key [T1573.001].
For more information on hmsvc.exe, including IOCs and detection signatures, see MAR-10382254-1.

Victim 2
From late April through May 2022, CISA conducted an onsite incident response engagement at an
organization (Victim 2) where CISA observed bi-directional traffic between the organization and
suspected APT IP address 104.223.34[.]198. During incident response, CISA determined Victim 2
was compromised by multiple threat actor groups.
The threat actors using IP 104.223.34[.]198 gained initial access to Victim 2’s production
environment in late January 2022, or earlier. These actors likely obtained access by exploiting
Log4Shell in an unpatched VMware Horizon server. On or around January 30, likely shortly after the
threat actors gained access, CISA observed the actors using PowerShell scripts [T1059.001] to
callout to 109.248.150[.]13 via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [T1071.001] to retrieve
additional PowerShell scripts. Around the same period, CISA observed the actors attempt to
download [T1105] and execute a malicious file from 109.248.150[.]13. The activity started from IP
address 104.155.149[.]103, which appears to be part of the actors’ C2 [TA0011] infrastructure.
After gaining initial access to the VMware Horizon server, the threat actors moved laterally [TA0008]
via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1021.001] to multiple other hosts in the production
environment, including a security management server, a certificate server, a database containing
sensitive law enforcement data, and a mail relay server. The threat actors also moved laterally via
RDP to the organization’s disaster recovery network. The threat actors gained credentials [TA0006]

TLP:WHITE
for multiple accounts, including administrator accounts. It is unknown how these credentials were
acquired.
After moving laterally to other production environment hosts and servers, the actors implanted loader
malware on compromised servers containing executables enabling remote C2. The threat actors used
compromised administrator accounts to run the loader malware. The loader malware appears to be
modified versions of SysInternals LogonSessions, Du, or PsPing software. The embedded
executables belong to the same malware family, are similar in design and functionality to
658_dump_64.exe, and provide C2 capabilities to a remote operator. These C2 capabilities include
the ability to remotely monitor a system's desktop, gain reverse shell access, exfiltrate data, and
upload and execute additional payloads. The embedded executables can also function as a proxy.
CISA found the following loader malware:
●

SvcEdge.exe is a malicious Windows loader containing encrypted executable
f7_dump_64.exe. When executed, SvcEdge.exe decrypts and loads f7_dump_64.exe into
memory. During runtime, f7_dump_64.exe connects to hard-coded C2 server
134.119.177[.]107 over port 443.

●

odbccads.exe is a malicious Windows loader containing an encrypted executable. When
executed, odbccads.exe decrypts and loads the executable into memory. The executable
attempts communication with the remote C2 address 134.119.177[.]107.

●

praiser.exe is a Windows loader containing an encrypted executable. When executed,
praiser.exe decrypts and loads the executable into memory. The executable attempts
connection to hard-coded C2 address 162.245.190[.]203.

●

fontdrvhosts.exe is a Windows loader that contains an encrypted executable. When
executed, fontdrvhosts.exe decrypts and loads the executable into memory. The
executable attempts connection to hard-coded C2 address 155.94.211[.]207.

●

winds.exe is a Windows loader containing an encrypted malicious executable and was found
on a server running as a service. During runtime, the encrypted executable is decrypted and
loaded into memory. The executable attempts communication with hard-coded C2 address
185.136.163[.]104. winds.exe has complex obfuscation, hindering the analysis of its code
structures. The executable’s inbound and outbound communications are encrypted with an
XOR key [T1573.001].

For more information on these malware samples, including IOCs and detection signatures, see MAR10382580-1.
Additionally, CISA identified a Java® Server Pages (JSP) application (error_401.js) functioning as a
malicious webshell [T505.003] and a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file:
●

error_401.jsp is a webshell designed to parse data and commands from incoming HTTP
requests, providing a remote operator C2 capabilities over compromised Linux and Windows
systems. error_401.jsp allows actors to retrieve files from the target system, upload files to

TLP:WHITE
the target system, and execute commands on the target system. rtelnet is used to execute
commands on the target system. Commands and data sent are encrypted via RC4
[T1573.001]. For more information on error_401.jsp, including IOCs, see [MAR10382580-2].
●

newdev.dll ran as a service in the profile of a known compromised user on a mail relay
server. The malware had path: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\newdev.dll. The DLL
may be the same newdev.dll attributed to the APT actors in open-source reporting; however,
CISA was unable to recover the file for analysis.

Threat actors collected [TA0009] and likely exfiltrated [TA0010] data from Victim 2’s production
environment. For a three week period, the security management and certificate servers
communicated with the foreign IP address 92.222.241[.]76. During this same period, the security
management server sent more than 130 gigabytes (GB) of data to foreign IP address
92.222.241[.]76, indicating the actors likely exfiltrated data from the production environment. CISA
also found .rar files containing sensitive law enforcement investigation data [T1560.001] under a
known compromised administrator account.
Note: the second threat actor group had access to the organization's test and production
environments, and on or around April 13, 2022, leveraged CVE-2022-22954 to implant the Dingo Jspy webshell. According to trusted third-party reporting, multiple large organizations have been
targeted by cyber actors leveraging CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960. For more information on
exploitation of CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960, see CISA CSA Threat Actors Chaining
Unpatched VMware Vulnerabilities for Full System Control.

INCIDENT RESPONSE
If administrators discover system compromise, CISA and CGCYBER recommend:
1. Immediately isolating affected systems.
2. Collecting and reviewing relevant logs, data, and artifacts.
3. Considering soliciting support from a third-party incident response organization that can
provide subject matter expertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid
residual issues that could enable follow-on exploitation.
4. Reporting incidents to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or 888-2820870). To report cyber incidents to the Coast Guard pursuant to 33 CFR Section
101.305, contact the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) National Response Center (NRC)
(NRC@uscg.mil or 800-424-8802).

MITIGATIONS
CISA and CGCYBER recommend organizations install updated builds to ensure affected VMware
Horizon and UAG systems are updated to the latest version.
•

If updates or workarounds were not promptly applied following VMware’s release of
updates for Log4Shell in December 2021, treat those VMware Horizon systems as
compromised. Follow the pro-active incident response procedures outlined above prior to
applying updates. If no compromise is detected, apply these updates as soon as possible.
o

o
o

See VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0028.13 and VMware Knowledge Base
(KB) 87073 to determine which VMware Horizon components are vulnerable.
Note: until the update is fully implemented, consider removing vulnerable components
from the internet to limit the scope of traffic. While installing the updates, ensure
network perimeter access controls are as restrictive as possible.
If upgrading is not immediately feasible, see KB87073 and KB87092 for vendorprovided temporary workarounds. Implement temporary solutions using an account
with administrative privileges. Note that these temporary solutions should not be
treated as permanent fixes; vulnerable components should be upgraded to the latest
build as soon as possible.
Prior to implementing any temporary solution, ensure appropriate backups have been
completed.
Verify successful implementation of mitigations by executing the vendor supplied script
Horizon_Windows_Log4j_Mitigations.zip without parameters to ensure that no
vulnerabilities remain. See KB87073 for details.

Additionally, CISA and CGCYBER recommend organizations:
•
•

•

Keep all software up to date and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs).
Minimize the internet-facing attack surface by hosting essential services on a segregated
DMZ, ensuring strict network perimeter access controls, and not hosting internet-facing
services non-essential to business operations. Where possible, implement regularly updated
WAFs in front of public-facing services. WAFs can protect against web based exploitation
using signatures and heuristics that are likely to block or alert on malicious traffic.
Use best practices for identity and access management (IAM) by implementing multifactor
authentication (MFA), enforcing use of strong passwords, and limiting user access through the
principle of least privilege.
