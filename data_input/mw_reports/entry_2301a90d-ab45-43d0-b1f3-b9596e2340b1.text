The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warns of potential critical
threats similar to recent cyberthreats targeting Ukraine
U.S. companies are advised to implement cybersecurity measures to maximize
resilience
The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform provides continuous protection against wiper-style
threats and real-time visibility across workloads
CISA recently advised U.S. business leaders to protect their companies from destructive
malware that has been seen targeting Ukraine. This emphasizes the importance of having
the right technologies in place. The automated detection and protection capabilities of the
CrowdStrike Falcon platform protect customers from this malware, provide them with visibility
into their environments and allow for intelligent monitoring of cloud resources. Falcon
customers gain insights into overall security posture and the actions required to prevent
potential security incidents.
Following mid-January 2022 incidents involving a series of Ukrainian website defacements
and the deployment of data-wiping WhisperGate malware, CISA issued guidance on how
companies can maximize resilience against similar incidents.

To better understand how WhisperGate malware operates, CrowdStrike Intelligence recently
performed a technical analysis of the malicious bootloader and how the destructive wiping
operation occurs.
The Falcon platform uses machine learning and behavior-based detections to provide
continuous protection from threats — including data-wiping malware — and deliver real-time
visibility across workloads.

A Primer on Destructive Malware
Destructive malware includes threats that render compromised systems inoperable by
deleting or wiping critical data instead of making it inaccessible through encryption.
In 2017, two destructive ransomware outbreaks — NotPetya and WannaCry — leveraged
the EternalBlue vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to quickly spread
and infect vulnerable systems worldwide.
The NotPetya ransomware outbreak started in Ukraine, and shortly after security
researchers found that a faulty encryption routine made file recovery impossible regardless
of whether victims paid. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak that followed also made data
recovery impossible, as the ransomware could not tie payment to a particular victim
machine.
The recent WhisperGate threat targeting Ukraine features no decryption or data-recovery
mechanism, and only performs destructive wiping operations on the infected host’s hard
drives. While the threat attempts to masquerade as genuine modern ransomware operations,
it irrevocably corrupts the affected host’s data. The CISA alert urges companies to
immediately implement cybersecurity measures to protect their infrastructures.

Gain Visibility and Stop Threats with the Falcon Platform
The Falcon platform offers unified visibility, threat detection and continuous monitoring and
compliance for any environment, enabling security teams to reduce the time it takes to detect
and mitigate security risks.
The Falcon sensor employs behavior-based detections using indicators of attack (IOAs) and
on-sensor and in-the-cloud machine learning to identify and block threats while incorporating
intelligence derived by continuously monitoring tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
related to threats and threat actors.
Data-wiping threats, including the recent WhisperGate, perform destructive operations on the
infected host’s hard drive, making data unrecoverable. CrowdStrike Intelligence performed
an analysis on the malicious bootloader, but WhisperGate also uses a downloader to retrieve

the final data-wiping payload. The Falcon platform uses on-sensor machine learning to
detect and prevent the downloader before fetching the data-wiping component, as seen in
the screenshot below.

The data-wiping payload reads the file name and adds a random integer at the end of file. It
then replaces the 0x100000 bytes of the file with hex 0xcc and renames the file, making the
data unrecoverable, as seen in Figure 2.

The Falcon platform automatically detects and prevents the final data-wiping payload, using
machine learning and behavior-based detection. Figure 3 reveals that the Falcon sensor
immediately detects and protects from any data-wiping activity.

By accurately identifying malicious activity, gaining visibility into suspicious behaviors and
prioritizing threats, the Falcon platform eliminates noise and reduces alert fatigue, allowing
organizations to respond faster to potential threat incidents and gain deep visibility of
potential security blind spots.

Maximize Resilience
Organizations that face risk from cyber incidents, including data-wiping threats, are strongly
encouraged to take appropriate measures to protect their business from any significant
impact on their operations.
CISA recommends that organizations take cyber risk and operational resilience seriously and
take steps to reduce potential damages, detect intrusions and respond to potential threats.
The Falcon platform protects customers against sophisticated adversaries and sophisticated
threats, accelerating response and offering visibility into the overall security posture of the
organization. Organizations leveraging the power of the Falcon platform can detect and
protect themselves from ransomware, data-wiping malware and other sophisticated threats
and adversaries.
