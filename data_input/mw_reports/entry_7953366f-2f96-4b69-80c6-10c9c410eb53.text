EtterSilent: the underground’s new favorite maldoc
builder

The cybercrime underground often mimics behaviors that we see in everyday facets of life.
Intel 471’s latest discovery is an example of one of these patterns: when a product takes off in
the marketplace, users will rush to obtain it and find unique ways to use it in order to fit their
needs.
The latest “product” is a malicious document builder, known in the underground as
“EtterSilent,” that Intel 471 has seen leveraged by various cybercrime groups. As it has grown
in popularity, it has constantly been updated in order to avoid detection. Used in conjunction
with other forms of malware, it’s a prime example of how ease of use and a concentration of
skill sets leads to a commoditization of the cybercrime economy.

How it works
First advertised on a well-known Russian cybercrime forum, the seller offered two types of
weaponized Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) to users: one that exploits a known
vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-8570) and another that uses a malicious macro.
To our knowledge, the maldoc with the macro is the more popular choice, possibly due to
lower pricing and higher compatibility when compared to the exploit.
The malicious document, when opened, shows a template that poses as DocuSign, the
popular software that allows individuals and organizations to electronically sign documents.
The maldoc then leverages Excel 4.0 macros stored in a hidden sheet, which allow an
externally-hosted payload to be downloaded, written to disk and executed using regsvr32 or
rundll32. From there, attackers can follow up and drop other assorted malware.

A cybercrime extravaganza
Ettersilent is being used in many malware campaigns, many of which will be familiar to most
cybersecurity experts.
It was used in a recent spam campaign to drop an updated version of Trickbot. The maldoc
was attached in an email that pretended to be from a well-known multinational appliance
manufacturer, claiming to be a payment invoice.
On March 19, 2021, EtterSilent was used as part of a Bazar loader campaign. The analyzed
maldoc did not use a DocuSign template, but the main Excel sheet was named “DocuSign®.”
The maldoc downloads the Bazar payload, which in turn connects to another URL that
downloads the related Bazar backdoor.

Everyone needs hosting
Three banking trojans — BokBot, Gozi ISFB and QBot —have also used EtterSilent in
conjunction with their schemes. However, what makes these campaigns stand out is their
reliance on bulletproof hosting, which is needed to stand up their schemes. All three
campaigns use services run by Yalishanda, one of the world’s most notorious BPH providers.
Intel 471 tracked a particular campaign tied to BokBot that had numerous distribution URLs
embedded in the EtterSilent maldocs. As of the time this blog was published, all of those
domains resolved to one particular IP address. That address is tied to bulletproof
infrastructure provided by Yalishanda. The usage of Yalishanda’s BPH service specifically for
the delivery URL is reminiscent of years worth of Hancitor campaigns observed by Intel 471.
We have written extensively how bulletproof hosting works hand-in-glove with cybercrime
for decades, supplying criminals with the infrastructure they need to carry out their crimes.
EtterSilent’s attachment to Yalishanda is another example of that notion.

A piece in a bigger puzzle
The widespread use of EtterSilent shows how commoditization is a big part of the cybercrime
economy. Different players specialize in their respective area, whether that be robust hosting,
spam infrastructure, maldoc builders, or malware as a service, and find ways to leverage each
other’s products in services by working together. A better understanding of not only the
malware being used, but how the cybercrime economy works and who the major players are,
helps defenders focus on the threats most relevant to our organizations.
