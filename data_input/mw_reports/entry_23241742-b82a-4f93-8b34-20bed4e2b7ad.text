Hackers targeted cybersecurity researchers and developers this week in a sophisticated
malware campaign distributing a malicious version of the dnSpy .NET application to install
cryptocurrency stealers, remote access trojans, and miners.
dnSpy is a popular debugger and .NET assembly editor used to debug, modify, and
decompile .NET programs. Cybersecurity researchers commonly use this program when
analyzing .NET malware and software.
While the software is no longer actively developed by the initial developers, the original
source code and a new actively developed version is available on GitHub to be cloned and
modified by anyone.

Malicious dnSpy delivers a cocktail of malware
This week, a threat actor created a GitHub repository with a compiled version of dnSpy that
installs a cocktail of malware, including clipboard hijackers to steal cryptocurrency, the
Quasar remote access trojan, a miner, and a variety of unknown payloads.
This new campaign was discovered by security researchers 0day enthusiast and
MalwareHunterTeam who saw the malicious dnSpy project initially hosted at
https://github[.]com/carbonblackz/dnSpy/ and then switching to
https://github[.]com/isharpdev/dnSpy to appear more convincing.

The threat actors also created a website at dnSpy[.]net that was nicely designed and
professional-looking. This site is now down, but you can see a screenshot of the archived
version below.

To promote the website, the threat actors performed successful search engine optimization
to get dnSpy[.]net listed on the first page of Google. This domain was also listed
prominently on Bing, Yahoo, AOL, Yandex, and Ask.com.
As a backup plan, they also took out search engine ads to appear as the first item in search
results, as shown below.

The malicious dnSpy application looks like the normal program when executed. It allows
you to open .NET applications, debug them, and perform all the normal functions of the
program.

However, when the malicious dnSpy application [VirusTotal] is launched, it will execute a
series of commands that create scheduled tasks that run with elevated permissions.
In a list of the commands shared with BleepingComputer by MalwareHunterTeam, the
malware performs the following actions:
Disables Microsoft Defender
Uses bitsadmin.exe to download curl.exe to %windir%\system32\curl.exe.
Uses curl.exe and bitsadmin.exe to download a variety of payloads to the C:\Trash
folder and launch them.
Disables User Account Control.

The payloads are downloaded from http://4api[.]net/ and include a variety of malware listed
below:
%windir%\system32\curl.exe - The curl program.
C:\Trash\c.exe - Unknown [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\ck.exe - Unknown
C:\Trash\cbot.exe - Clipboard Hijacker [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\cbo.exe - Unknown [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\qs.exe - Quasar RAT [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\m.exe - Miner [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\d.exe - Legitimate Defender Control application to disable Microsoft
Defender. [VirusTotal]
C:\Trash\nnj.exe - Unknown
The clipboard hijacker (cbot.exe) uses cryptocurrency addresses used in previous attacks
with some success. The bitcoin address has stolen 68 bitcoin transactions totaling
approximately $4,200.
The cryptocurrency addresses used as part of this campaign are:

At this time, both the dnSpy[.]net and the GitHub repository used to power this campaign
are shut down.
However, security researchers and developers need to constantly be on the lookout for
malicious clones of popular projects that install malware on their devices.
Attacks on cybersecurity researchers and developers are not new and are increasingly
becoming more common to steal undisclosed vulnerabilities, source code, or gain access to
sensitive networks.
Last year, Google and security researchers discovered that state-sponsored North Korean
hackers targeted vulnerability researchers using a variety of lures. These lures included
fake Visual Studio projects, Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerabilities, malicious
cybersecurity companies, and malicious IDA Pro downloads.
