Introduction
June ended as the month of #PrintNightmare, and the critical vulnerability impacts many
organizations. Many of the (nation-state) threat actors will likely abuse this flaw if they were
not already abusing it. Like last month, an overview of this month’s observed cyber
operations was shared by security researchers via Twitter. Where applicable, I will briefly
describe the geopolitical tension between states. In this month’s overview, IOC’s from nationstate threat actors were selected that presumably originate from actors from Vietnam, China,
India, and Pakistan, by basically searching for the keywords “apt“ and “c2:” or “c2” over the

1/9

collected Twitter data from June 2021. The reported IOC’s have not been examined yet and
are therefore weakly anchored with evidence. But let’s see what has been shared by security
researchers for June 2021.

Middle East

Gaza
In June, the following campaign was shared via Twitter by the alleged Palestinian threat
actor dubbed APT-C-23 or Desert Viper.

Some other malware samples were also shared on Twitter:

Some researchers on Twitter refer that the above samples might indicate that EgyptAir might
be a target of the actor.

"New sample seems used by #APT-C-23. Once it gets executed, a document relating to
infomation about #EgyptAir is shown to confuse the victim and meanwhile #RAT is
executed to perform remote control.

Iran
I will not go into disputes with other countries because there are many tensions between
Iran's neighbors or the United States. Iran as a country is protected by mountains that are
natural borders and is one of the highly populated and educated countries in the region.
Therefore also a force to reckon with. There a multiple alleged nation-state actor groups that
originate from Iran. For an overview of actors, visit the threat actor card maintained by the
Thai Cert. This month the following activity was observed of APT34 or Oilrig. One of the
actor groups which is held responsible for the Shamoon attacks in 2012.

Figure 2: Dam tensions in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam

Vietnam
China is building multiple dams on the Mekong river. This also impacts the water flow
downstream and impacts the irrigation of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Since
the building of the damns by China, geopolitical tensions are growing. Water is the new oil,
and whoever controls it gains power. This, among other disputes, brings tensions in the
South China Sea. Multiple threat actors are tracked from this region. One of them originates
from Vietnam and is dubbed OceanLotus or APT32.
The following samples of APT32 were collected during June via Twitter.

China has a tremendous amount of nation-state actor groups. One of them has been dubbed
by Crowdstrike as Mustang Panda and targets aviation, Government, NGOs, Think Tanks
worldwide.

APT41
Although no direct indicators were shared on Twitter, AirIndia was compromised by an actor
called APT41, according to threat intelligence company Group-IB. According to FireEye,
APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage
activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control. The
group targets the following sectors worldwide: Construction, Defense, Education, Energy,
Financial, Government, Healthcare, High-Tech, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Media, Oil and
Gas, Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical, Retail, Telecommunications, Transportation, Online
video game companies.
The analysis of Group-IB was called the “Big Airline Heist.” Their report contains many
indicators of compromise. Their tweet is shared below.
"New Group-IB #ThreatIntelligence blog is live!
Group-IB team attributed #AirIndia incident with moderate confidence to Chinese
nation-state TA #APT41.
The campaign was codenamed #ColunmTK

Also, in June, the alleged nation-state actor that belongs to Pakistan Transparent Tribe or
APT36 has been very active.
For example, in June 2021, the following campaigns were shared on Twitter.
"Today our researchers have found sample which belongs to #TranSparentTribe #APT

Lastly, a new Pakistani APT, dubbed ReverseRat, was reported by Lumen in June, targeting
medical and energy corporations in India. Indicators are listed below.

Conclusion
Twitter continues to be a valuable source to share threat intelligence on ongoing nation-state
operations. In June 2021, many potential campaigns from different nation-state actors were
reported on Twitter by security researchers or threat hunters in areas with high geopolitical
tensions. A brief overview of some of these actors for June was outlined. Further research
needs to be conducted if these IOCs can indeed be anchored to these aforementioned
nation-states and understand more about their operations and victims. In the next article, I
will further assess one or two potential interesting TransparentTribe malware samples

8/9

covered in this article to determine if tracking for such an actor can be improved or to gain a
better understanding of their operations. Until next time and sharing is caring!
