On 2024-04-22, the @malware_traffic posted on their Twitter handle that the epoch4 Emotet server started spamming
and delivering zipped .lnk files to its victims through spam email, as shown in Figure 1. The .lnk file further executes
VBScript or PowerShell script to download the Emotet payload in the victims’ machine. The use of a .lnk file and
PowerShell or VBScript is a new combination that has not been used by the Emotet before.

The Cyble Research Labs has already published a blog about Emotet TTPs in February 2022. During this time, the
Emotet was delivered to users with a spam email containing an MS excel attachment.

The initial infection starts when the user extracts the password-protected zip file and executes the link file in the
machine. Upon execution, the .lnk file has commands to drop a malicious VB script file in the Temp location of the
target machine, as shown in the below figure.

Figure 2 – Command to Drop VBScript

The dropped VB script further executes with the help of WScript.exe, downloads the Emotet payload from the remote
server, and executes it using regsvr32.exe. The payload URLs are encoded using base64 and decoded during
runtime for downloading the Emotet payload. The below Figure shows the VBS file.

On 2024-04-26, the Emotet campaigns started using .lnk and PowerShell combinations for delivering the payloads. In
this campaign, the .lnk file drops a PowerShell file in the Temp folder, which further downloads the Emotet payload
from the remote server and executes it using regsvr32.exe. The below Figure shows the PowerShell command used
by the malware.
