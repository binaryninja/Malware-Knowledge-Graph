Today, BleepingComputer discovered a new variant of the CryptoMix ransomware that
appends the .WORK extension to encrypted files and changes the contact emails used by the
ransomware.
In this article I will provide a brief summary of any changes that have occurred in this new
variant. As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and
decide to pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can
also discuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated
Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.

Changes in the WORK Cryptomix Ransomware Variant
While the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some slight
differences. The ransom note is still named _HELP_INSTRUCTION.TXT, but now uses
the worknow@keemail.me, worknow@protonmail.com,
worknow8@yandex.com, worknow9@yandex.com, and worknow@techie.com
emails for a victim to contact for payment information.

WORK CryptoMix Ransom Note

The next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version,
when a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the
.WORKextension to encrypted file's name. For example, a test file encrypted by this variant
has an encrypted file name of 0D0A516824060636C21EC8BC280FEA12.WORK.

As this is just a cursory analysis of this new variant, if anything else is discovered, we will be
sure to update this article.

How to protect yourself from the WORK CryptoMix Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from ransomware, it is important that you use good computing
habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested
backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware
attack.
You should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat
ransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft AntiMalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent
many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases
are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.

3/5

Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral
detections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your
willing to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
