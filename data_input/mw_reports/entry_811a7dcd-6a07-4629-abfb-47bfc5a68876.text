The infamous Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Poison Ivy (hereafter referred to as PIVY) has
resurfaced recently, and exhibits some new behaviors. PIVY has been observed targeting a
number of Asian countries for various purposes over the past year. Palo Alto Networks’ Unit
42 recently blogged about a new Poison Ivy variant targeting Hong Kong activists dubbed
SPIVY that uses DLL sideloading and operates quite differently from a variant recently
observed by ASERT that has been active for at least the past 12 months.

The PIVY variant that ASERT has observed has exhibited some newer behavior that we have
not seen discussed previously. The samples drop a decoy doc – usually hinting clearly at the
target, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll and the PIVY shellcode ﬁle as Active.dat. The
ActiveUpdate.dll and Active.dat ﬁles are created in a directory that follows the format
ActiveUpdate_ [0-9]{3}. The executable copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and then
executes the new ﬁle with the path to the DLL and installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk
in the Windows Startup folder. ESET identiﬁed these samples as “Win32/Korplug.I[F-I]
variant“, possibly due to the appearance of the malware using DLL sideloading with rundll32
to load the dropped DLL and perform its malicious actions. This deployment tactic dates well
into last year (and possibly before) using different executable names for the rundll32 copy and
the base directory name, however this post will only cover a subset of the variant using
“ActiveUpdate”.

The compile times on these binaries also closely correlate to the times they were ﬁrst
observed in-the-wild and some samples contained timestamp-like entities in the various
campaign IDs ﬁelds in the malware conﬁguration.
The decrypted conﬁguration appears to be slightly modiﬁed in such a way as to confuse
some publicly available tools that parse the conﬁguration data. The campaign ID is not fully
null-padded – there is now one null-byte and a string of repeating “x” characters that will
cause confusion for some scripts. Additionally, the C2s are no longer null-padded – each
hostname ends with a null-byte that is then followed by a string that will look something like
“0.1127.0.0.1127.0.0.100000”. This string will change slightly with each Command & Control
(C2) server – the portions that start with “1” will change to 2 for the second C2, 3 for the third,
etc. These values end up being present elsewhere in memory without the extra items and only
small tweaks are needed to ﬁx the parsing.
The hostname webserver.servehttp[.]com is observed in a number of PIVY samples, some
of which are covered in this post. Additionally, the IP resolved to by this hostname
overlapped with ﬁleshare.serveftp[.]com which was used in an earlier and
seemingly unrelated PIVY sample.

A number of PIVY samples were observed to be targeting Myanmar and several other
countries in Asia. While the exact targets and delivery methods are not known to ASERT at
this time, the documents and submission sources provide strong hints as to the motivations
and potential targets of these exploitation campaigns. The sample described in the previous
section – a7d206791b1cdec616e9b18ae6fa1548ca96a321 – was observed to be targeting
Myanmar in late November 2015. The compile timestamp on the sample was November 2,

n

d

2015, the apparent timestamp in the ﬁlename appears to be referencing a report that was
released on November 25, 2015 and it was ﬁrst seen late evening in the US on November 24,
2015 which would equate to November 25 in Myanmar. The document was dropped as “STEP
Democracy Year 1 Acheivements_25112015.docx” and was also dropped by SHA1
724166261e9c2e7718be22b347671944a1e7fded with the name
“Year1achievementsv2.docx“, but that sample uses a different communications password
over the same set of C2s. The documents may be drafts of a ﬁnal report released in
December by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), a
part of the STEP Democracy initiative. The IDEA is “part of the European Union-funded
project Support to Electoral Processes and Democracy (STEP Democracy)” whose goal is to
support democracy worldwide. The IDEA has been working with Myanmar before and after
their recent election to ensure “peaceful, transparent and credible elections.” Part of this work
includes publishing reports and drafts such as those referenced above. In this case, the bait
ﬁle document metadata contains a company name of “IDEA” with an author of “Sophia” –
possibly referencing a current member of the organization and a last edited date of November
20, 2015. The content of the document details a debate around the democratic elections in
Myanmar. This timeline would put the targeting past the elections that occurred in early
November, but appears to still be focused on individuals interested in democracy inside of
Myanmar. The targeting of the post-election Myanmar appears to be following the same style
as what was mentioned in the “Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger” paper by ASERT. In
this case however it appears that threat actors began using references to the STEP
organization to continue their likely spearphish tactic by leveraging content relevant to postelection Myanmar. A possible connection exists given that the C2 for these samples –
jackhex.md5c[.]com – resolved to an IP contained within 103.240.203.0/22 as did a 9002
RAT sample in the Seven Pointed Dagger exploitation campaign. A “LURK0” Gh0strat and
another PIVY domain were also observed to have resolved to IPs contained within this range,
making this subnet more suspicious from a targeted attack perspective.

Dropped document referencing Myanmar’s democratic process
A number of documents that appear to be economically focused were also observed recently
and one of these samples also references Myanmar. This sample used a campaign ID of
“mm20160405” and dropped a document named “Chairman’s Report of the 19th ASEAN

Regional Forum Heads of Defence Universities, Colleges, Instiutions Meeting, Nay Pay
Taw, Myanmar.doc” that references an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
meeting that took place in Myanmar in September of 2015. The timing of this sample is quite
different from the earlier sample and seems to suggest at least a followup campaign due to
the malware compilation timestamp of March 28, 2016, combined with an apparent timestamp
value in the campaign ID of April 5, 2016 and the fact that the binary was ﬁrst observed in the
wild on April 11, 2016. The mutex speciﬁed in the conﬁguration – 20150120 – is the same
mutex used in the earlier sample that dropped a document referencing the STEP program, but
this mutex is also used in many other PIVY samples that use the “ActiveUpdate” directory
structure and is likely not useful for identifying the campaign or a relationship between
samples outside of possibly sharing a similar version. The C2 used in this sample –
admin.nslookupdns[.]com – resolved to an IP contained in the subnet 118.193.218.0/24.
Similar to the previous sample discussed, ASERT has observed an overlap between many
other malware families including Nitol, Gh0strat, and another PIVY sample that
uses “ActiveUpdate“. This sample’s C2 domain is news.tibetgroupworks[.]com which
provides an obvious suggestion at targeting dynamics, however no decoy documents were
dropped and no further information was discovered to help support the targeting hypothesis.

Dropped document referencing ASEAN meeting in Myanmar
Continuing on with the theme of campaigns targeting ASEAN, sample
31756ccdbfe05d0a510d2dcf207fdef5287de285 drops a decoy document named “Robertus
Subono-REGISTRATION_FORM_ASEAN_CMCoord2016.docx” that references an ASEAN
Humanitarian Civil Military Coordination meeting that took place in Bangkok between March
28 and April 1 2016. The document purports to be a registration form for an attendee from

Indonesia and is supposed to be sent to a Thailand Ministry of Defense email address. The
sample has a compilation date of March 10, 2016, was ﬁrst observed by ASERT on March 20,
2016 and also contains an invalid digital signature claiming to be signed by Google. Coupling
the campaign ID of “modth” with the purpose and location of the meeting and the email
address this form is supposed to be mailed to, a possible target of this sample could be
Thailand’s Ministry of Defense. The C2s used by this sample overlap with the prior sample
that references the ASEAN meeting in Myanmar nearly perfectly – the ﬁrst C2 uses port 80,
whereas the prior sample used 81 and they both use the same mutex and password. This
overlap suggests a possible ongoing targeting towards ASEAN members and meetings that
they hold.

ec646c57f9ac5e56230a17aeca6523a4532ff472 was also interesting in that it was not in
English like the other two observed documents – Google Translate identiﬁes the language in
the document as Mongolian.

The decoy document 1.docx that is dropped by
f389e1c970b2ca28112a30a8cfef1f3973fa82ea shows as corrupted when executed in
a sandbox, but manual recovery yielded a document in Korean with a malware campaign ID
of kk31. The document appears to reference Korean language schools abroad and the
telephone number present yields an afﬁliation with the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but
the intended target is unclear at this time.

Korean language decoy document dropped by
Sample f389e1c970b2ca28112a30a8cfef1f3973fa82ea dropped a decoy document named
“Commission on Filipinos Overseas & Dubai.doc“, but this document did not render
correctly in a malware sandbox or manually. VirusTotal revealed a sample from the Philippines
which suggests that they, not Dubai / UAE, were the targets. The C2s for this sample
used webserver.servehttp[.]com, also exhibited by many of the recent samples which
suggests the same actor may be involved in this campaign activity.

As this post and other recent posts detail, PIVY continues to evolve and be used in a myriad
of targeted exploitation campaigns – not unlike many other targeted malware families such as
PlugX or the Dukes. This will certainly not be the last evolution of PIVY, and ASERT continues
to monitor these threats as they are discovered. I would also like to say thank you to Curt
Wilson of ASERT for his assistance with research covered in this post.
