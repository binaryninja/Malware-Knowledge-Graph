free decryptions

March 17, 2021

A member of the cybercriminal community has discovered and disclosed a bug in the LockBit
ransomware that could have been used for free decryptions.
The bug impacts LockBit, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that launched in
January 2020 and through which the LockBit gang rents access to a version of their
ransomware strain.
Customers of the LockBit RaaS, also known as ‚Äúaffiliates,‚Äù execute intrusions into corporate
networks, where they deploy the ransomware to encrypt files and demand a ransom from
victims to provide a decryption key that unlocks their files.
Through a ransom note left on their desktop, LockBit victims are told to access a dark web
portal where they can negotiate the ransom payment. This ‚Äúpayment‚Äù portal also allows
victims access to a one-time free decryption operation, so victims can confirm that the
hackers have a legitimate and working copy of the decryption key.

In a message posted on an underground cybercrime forum today, a threat actor has posted
details about a bug in LockBit‚Äôs one-time free decryption mechanism that could have been
abused for unlimited free decryptions.

Giving legitimacy to the disclosure, the bug was made public by Bassterlord, a suspected
Russian-speaking threat actor who previously served as an affiliate for the LockBit
ransomware gang, but also other rival RaaS operations, such as REvil, Avaddon, and
RansomExx.
With details about the bug being posted in such a public manner, Bassterlord‚Äôs actions have
also sparked a discussion among security professionals about the proper way of reporting
bugs in ransomware strains.
John Fokker, Head of Cyber Investigations & Principal Engineer at security firm McAfee,
told The Record that the proper way would be to report any ransomware-related bugs to a
security vendor or the No More Ransom project.
Both security vendors and the No More Ransom project have well-established mechanisms
in place to take advantage of this information and help ransomware victims without alerting
the ransomware authors, Fokker said.

The McAfee exec said the advice applies to both independent security researchers but also
underground threat actors looking to sabotage their rivals.

Bug expected to be patched
Just like in previous instances when a bug in ransomware code was exposed, the LockBit
gang is now expected to patch the issue within days, making future free decryption
operations impossible. The LockBit portal was also conspicuously down all day today,
suggesting that fixes are possibly being implemented, Marcelo Rivero, a Malware
Intelligence Analyst at security firm Malwarebytes told The Record.
In addition, several other members of the security community have also told The Record that
the LockBit bug was something they were not aware of and which could have been very
useful.

It may not have been possible to decrypt large batches of files at once without alerting the
LockBit crew, but the bug could have been used to decrypt selected sensitive files for which
backups did not exist.
Currently, the LockBit ransomware is one of the most active ransomware groups today.
Security firm Coveware listed the LockBit ransomware as one of the top 15 ransomware
strains in Q4 2020.
According to data provided by the ID-Ransomware platform, the LockBit operation still infects
tens of victims every week.
