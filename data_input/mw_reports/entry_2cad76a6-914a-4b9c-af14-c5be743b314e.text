Counter Threat Unit Research Team

Summary
In 2017, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers continued to track GOLD
SKYLINE, a financially motivated Nigerian threat group involved in business email
compromise (BEC) and business email spoofing (BES) fraud. During the investigation,
1/17

CTU™ researchers discovered a previously unidentified BEC group that they have named
GOLD GALLEON.
Unlike other BEC groups, GOLD GALLEON does not target a wide range of businesses but
appears to focus solely on global maritime shipping businesses and their customers. CTU
researchers estimate that between June 2017 and January 2018, GOLD GALLEON
attempted to steal a minimum of $3.9 million U.S. dollars from maritime shipping businesses
and their customers. The threat actors' theft attempts average $6.7 million per year.
BEC is a social engineering scheme where threat actors gain access to a business's email
account. The actors typically use spearphishing emails with attached malicious payloads to
steal the email credentials of individuals responsible for handling business transactions.
Once the threat actors have obtained these credentials, they can intercept emails between
the two parties involved in a transaction and modify financial documents to direct funds to
attacker-controlled bank accounts. BEC and BES scams might seem unsophisticated, but
they continue to account for significant losses globally. For example, the FBI reported that
BEC and BES accounted for estimated losses of $5.3 billion between October 2013 and
December 2016.

Key points
GOLD GALLEON is a BEC threat group likely based in Nigeria.
The group targets maritime shipping organizations, including companies that provide
ship management services, port services, and cash to master[1] services.
Companies involved in shipping industries are typically globally dispersed and operate
in different time zones, meaning that they are often entirely reliant on email for
conducting business transactions. Some maritime shipping businesses are therefore
susceptible to BEC fraud methods.
The group uses a range of commodity remote access tools that have keylogging and
password-stealing functionality to steal email account credentials.
The group routinely tests malware on its own systems and tracks detection rates via
online virus scanners (e.g., NoDistribute).
As of this publication, CTU researchers have helped to interrupt multiple GOLD
GALLEON fraud attempts, averting losses of more than $800,000.

Who is GOLD GALLEON?
Over the course of the investigation into GOLD GALLEON, CTU researchers have been able
to develop unique and detailed insight into the threat group: how it operates, where it is
based, and its likely affiliations. GOLD GALLEON is a collection of at least 20 criminal
associates that collectively carry out BEC campaigns. The group appears to specifically
target maritime organizations and their customers. CTU researchers have observed GOLD
2/17

GALLEON targeting firms in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Norway, U.S.,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia. The threat actors leverage tools, tactics, and procedures
(TTPs) that are similar to those used by other BEC/BES groups that CTU researchers
previously investigated (e.g., GOLD SKYLINE). The groups have used the same caliber of
publicly available malware (inexpensive and commodity remote access trojans (RATs)),
crypters, and email lures.
The group appears to have a loose organizational structure, with activities coordinated by
several senior individuals. Tasks are allocated to individuals in the group; for example, one
group member may have responsibility for obfuscating the group's RATs with crypters, while
others are tasked with monitoring victims' email for business transactions that are about to
be invoiced. Some senior members often handle the purchasing of malware, crypters, and
infrastructure, and they frequently experiment with alternative tools. CTU researchers also
observed senior members coaching and mentoring less-experienced group members and
liaising with external providers of related criminal services (e.g., suppliers of mule accounts
for transferring stolen funds and crypter sellers; see Figure 1).

GOLD GALLEON uses the Hide My Ass! (HMA) proxy and similar privacy services to
disguise its origin. Several data points identified by CTU researchers suggest that it is highly
likely that GOLD GALLEON is based in Nigeria:
Visibility of the actors' systems suggest that many were regularly connecting to the
Internet via Nigeria-based infrastructure.

3/17

The GOLD GALLEON crewmembers communicate regularly using instant messenger
services such as Skype. Observed conversations between crewmembers were in
Nigerian Pidgin English (see Figure 2). Pidgin is a simplified form of speech that is
usually a mixture of two or more languages, has a rudimentary grammar and
vocabulary, and is used for communication between groups speaking different
languages. Appendix A shows additional examples of Nigerian Pidgin phrases
commonly used by GOLD GALLEON.

CTU researchers' visibility of the group's usernames, passwords, and other artifacts
suggest a strong link between members of GOLD GALLEON and a popular fraternity in
Nigeria dubbed the Buccaneer Confraternity (see Appendix B).

4/17

Links to the Buccaneer Confraternity
Many of the GOLD GALLEON conversations observed by CTU researchers used phrases,
usernames, and passwords that linked to the Buccaneer Confraternity group. Keywords such
as "awumen," "alora," "Sealords," and "1972buccaneer" in context reference the
confraternity. One GOLD GALLEON actor also used a Buccaneers Confraternity logo on an
online account (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Variant of the Buccaneers Confraternity logo. (Source: Secureworks)
The Buccaneers Confraternity was originally established to support human rights and social
justice in Nigeria. Reports suggest that a small subset of the group (often referred to as a
cult) may engage in criminality, which offers a potential explanation for GOLD GALLEON's
apparent links to the Buccaneer Confraternity movement.

How does GOLD GALLEON operate?
GOLD GALLEON displays similar tradecraft to other Nigerian-based BEC groups observed
by CTU researchers. The group follows a common operational pattern often relying on lowtier, free, or inexpensive tools. What it lacks in technical prowess is made up for in social
engineering, agility, and persistence. Despite technical challenges and minimal investments
in cybercrime tools, infrastructure, and automation, the group's profit margins are orders of
magnitude greater than its initial investment.

Reconnaissance

5/17

CTU researchers assess that GOLD GALLEON identifies target email addresses by
conducting reconnaissance of publicly available contact information (e.g., a company's
website). The actors may leverage commercially available marketing tools that scrape email
addresses from company websites (e.g., Email Extractor, BoxxerMail). CTU researchers
found evidence that suggests these threat actors occasionally purchase email lists of target
businesses. In order to acquire new victims after gaining entry into a target's inbox, the threat
actors use a free tool called EmailPicky to extract the target's contacts from their address
book, as well as every email address with which the target has had an exchange. Many of
the harvested contacts are in the maritime shipping industry, so this tactic can be extremely
fruitful for the threat actors.

Attacker TTPs/attribution
Similar to other BEC threat groups, GOLD GALLEON uses spearphishing emails with
malicious attachments to compromise its victims (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. GOLD GALLEON crewmember crafting a phishing email. (Source: Secureworks)
The spearphishing emails are created with the intended recipient in mind, in this case
focusing on shipping topics. When opened, attachments deploy a RAT that has keylogging
and password-stealing functionality. Tools deployed by GOLD GALLEON include the
Predator Pain, PonyStealer, Agent Tesla, and HawkEye keyloggers. All of the malware
leveraged by GOLD GALLEON is readily available from online hacking markets. For
example, the cost for the Agent Tesla RAT is between $12 and $69, depending on the
support levels provided (see Figure 5).

Actions on objectives
Once the GOLD GALLEON crew compromises the business email accounts of a company's
employees, crewmembers monitor the employees' inboxes to identify emails for ongoing
business transactions. In a typical BEC scam (see Figure 6), an attacker compromises a
seller's email account to position themselves as a "man-in-the-middle" between the seller
and a buyer in an existing business transaction. The threat actor then uses their control of
the seller's account to passively monitor the transaction. When it is time for payment details
to be relayed to the buyer via an invoice, the threat actor intercepts the seller's email and
changes the destination bank account on the invoice to the attacker's money mule account. If
the revised payment account does not appear to be suspicious, the buyer will likely submit
the payment.

7/17

CTU researchers observed GOLD GALLEON threat actors successfully submitting
fraudulent invoices to buyers while a business transaction was in progress. The altered
invoices were modified from genuine versions created by the seller that were available in the
seller's email account. The threat actors were in control of the seller's email account and
were monitoring email traffic, but the buyer was not likely to question the invoice because it
appeared to contain correct and familiar information. Only the bank details where the money
was to be wired were changed.
Cloned domains and look-alike email addresses

8/17

In order to impersonate a buyer or seller in a particular transaction, GOLD GALLEON and
other BEC groups have purchased domains that closely resemble the buyer or seller's
company name, also known as "cloning." CTU researchers have also observed BEC threat
actors registering email accounts that contain a variation of the target's name (e.g., john .
doe @ gmail . com or jdoe @ gmail . com. With these look-alike domains and/or email
addresses in hand, the cybercriminals can impersonate either party.

Disrupting the adversary — Incident case studies
The cybersecurity industry clearly has a role to play in disrupting these threats. While
investigating the activities of GOLD GALLEON and another BEC group conducting fraud
against the shipping industry, CTU researchers were able to interrupt dozens of BEC fraud
attempts. Victim notifications prevented some fraudulent transfers, and identification of
attacker-controlled accounts enabled banks to stop fraudulent use.
The following case studies offer additional insight into GOLD GALLEON's methods and also
highlight some of the challenges when disrupting these threats.

Case study 1: Thanks, but we already know… we just don't know how.
One of the companies that GOLD GALLEON compromised was a shipping company based
in South Korea. The threat actors were able to steal credentials for eight different email
accounts, including an account for one of the company's accountants. With this access,
GOLD GALLEON targeted all of the company's clients. The threat actors monitored the
South Korean company's business email day and night and became very familiar with the
company's billing cycles, clients, and various business deals.
Not long after CTU researchers began tracking GOLD GALLEON, the threat actors were
monitoring a business transaction where the South Korean shipping company was
requesting "cash to master" (CTM) services for a ship arriving in the U.S. The South Korean
company sent an email to the U.S.-based CTM organization requesting delivery of the
approximately $50,000 in crew's wages and clarification of the total payout fee (see Figure
7).

To insert themselves into the transaction, GOLD GALLEON threat actors set up an Outlook
email account using the name of an employee working for the CTM company and sent a
fraudulent email. The message requested that the South Korean company submit payment
to the CTM's "subsidiary [bank] account," because the CTM was purportedly working to
resolve an issue with their regular bank regarding extra fees (see Figure 8). The provided
account details were for a mule account used by GOLD GALLEON.

Korean ship management company into diverting funds to the attacker-controlled bank
account. (Source: Secureworks)

10/17

Aware that the South Korean company was potentially about to send $50,000 to the threat
group and not to the intended provider of ship services, CTU researchers notified the U.S.
company as quickly as possible. Separately, the South Korean shipping company had been
in touch with the U.S. shipping agent to verify that the subsidiary account payment details
were correct, so the U.S. shipping agent was already aware of the fraud attempt. However,
the agent did not know how the South Korean company had received the altered bank
account details. CTU researchers were able to complete the picture for them.

Case study 2: If at first you don't succeed…
When CTU researchers detected the GOLD GALLEON crew attempting to defraud another
one of the South Korean company's clients for $325,585, they notified the potential victim.
The client, a large Japanese company with clients in the Far East and the Southeast Asian
regions, provides marine transportation of petroleum products, chemicals, and other liquids.
CTU researchers notified the Japanese company and explained the ongoing fraud attempt.
The company was aware of the situation, as they judged that the payment request was
suspicious. Despite the failed attempt, the GOLD GALLEON actors repeated their attempt
using a forged invoice on the South Korean company's letterhead.
This was a common tactic the GOLD GALLEON crew used to try and fool the clients of the
South Korean shipping company. The GOLD GALLEON threat actors were able to obtain a
copy of the Korean shipping company's corporate letterhead by impersonating the Japanese
marine transportation company. They stated in their email request that they needed to
present it to their bank to process payment for the South Korean company's services (see
Figure 9). The South Korean company obliged and sent them an electronic copy, which the
threat actors continued using for future spoofed correspondence with many of the company's
clients.

Case study 3: Third time's a charm
A week after the fraud attempt on the Japanese marine transportation company, CTU
researchers detected GOLD GALLEON attempting to steal $234,834 owed to the South
Korean shipping company by another client: a large multinational Japanese conglomerate. In
response, CTU researchers notified both parties, as well as the bank where the mule
account due to receive the stolen funds was located.
GOLD GALLEON had used the spoofed email address of the South Korean company's
accountant and sent a request to the Japanese conglomerate on the company letterhead to
remit payment of the $234,834 to the attacker-controlled bank account. In this particular
instance, the Japanese conglomerate was suspicious when they received the request to
change payment to an alternate bank account. However, only with the additional context
provided from the CTU researchers' notification were they able to understand the full nature
of the risks they were facing.
Additionally, CTU researchers reached out to the South Korean CERT (KN-CERT) so it in
turn could notify the South Korean company of the nefarious activity and help them mitigate
the threat on their network. KN-CERT also helped the South Korean shipping company
implement security measures to monitor and help protect their business email from being
compromised in a similar way in the future.

Conclusion

12/17

By disclosing details of the GOLD GALLEON threat, its capabilities, and its approach to
conducting BEC-related fraud, CTU researchers are trying to provide a greater
understanding of the BEC threat and why these campaigns continue to be so lucrative. As
evidenced in this report, the monetary losses can be significant to the victims and the
affected businesses. In some cases, the victims are unaware of what is happening until it is
too late. Organizations in some industries (in this case shipping) may be exposed to
heightened risk as threat actors focus their attempts toward industries that are more
susceptible to these techniques. CTU researchers encourage organizations to evaluate the
BEC threat in the context of their own systems and consider the following steps to mitigate
the risks associated with BEC:
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for corporate and personal email. Small and
medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are popular targets for BEC groups because SMBs
typically have limited security budgets. Most BEC threat actors rely on remote access
to a company's email via commodity webmail programs, so 2FA would deter all but the
most sophisticated attackers.
Inspect the corporate email control panel for suspicious redirect rules. An unexplained
redirect rule that sends incoming email from specific addresses to third-party systems
could indicate a compromise and should trigger an organization's incident response
process.
Carefully review wire transfer information in suppliers' email requests to identify
suspicious details.
Always confirm wire transfer instructions with designated suppliers using a previously
established non-email mode of communication, such as a fax number or phone
number. Establish this communication channel using a method other than email.
Require multiple approvals for wire transfers, and ensure this procedure is difficult for
cybercriminals to discover.
Question any changes to typical business practices and designated wire transfer
activity (e.g., a business contact suddenly asking to be contacted via their personal
email address or a change to an organization's designated bank account information).
Be suspicious of pressure to take action quickly and of promises to apply large price
discounts on future orders if payment is made immediately.
Thoroughly check email addresses for accuracy and watch for small changes that
mimic legitimate addresses, such as the addition, removal, substitution, or duplication
of single characters in the address or hostname (e.g., username@example.com versus
username@ examp1e.com).
Create detection rules that flag emails with extensions that are similar to company
email addresses (e.g., abc_company versus abc-company).
Limit the information that employees post to social media and to the company website,
especially information about job duties and descriptions, management hierarchy, and
out-of-office details.
Consider adopting the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) standards to
deter money laundering and fraudulent wire transfers.
13/17

Consider using the free pdfxpose tool that CTU researchers developed to help detect
wire-wire fraud. CTU analysis of GOLD SKYLINE activity revealed that the threat
actors edited PDF invoice files by redacting the original payment details with a white
opaque rectangle and then overlaying it with the money mule account information. This
tool searches for sub-page-sized opaque rectangles with text overlays and adjusts the
opacity and color to reveal potentially suspicious edits.

Appendix B — The Buccaneers Confraternity
The Buccaneers Confraternity is a descendant of the Pyrates Confraternity group (also
known as the National Association of Seadogs). According to historical records, the Pyrates
Confraternity was founded in 1952 by Nobel-prize winning author Wole Soyinka and six of
his friends (see Figure 13). The first chapter was formed on the campus of University College
Ibadan, a prestigious institution and one of the oldest universities in Nigeria. The
confraternity was conceived as a response to class privilege, elitism, and other perceived
social injustices against poorer students at the university. Membership was open to male
16/17

students who were academically bright, regardless of their tribe or religion. The antiestablishment group adopted the motto "Against all conventions" and the classic Jolly Roger
skull and crossbones pirate flag as its logo. Members went by names such as "Cap'n Blood"
and "Long John Silver." The organization's ceremonies and customs revolve heavily around
pirate symbology. The Pyrates Confraternity became the only confraternity on Nigerian
campuses for almost 20 years.

Figure 13. The "Original Seven" founding members of the Pyrates Confraternity in pirate
costumes. (Source: https://www.nas-int.org/about-nas/history)
In 1972, a schism took place when Pyrate Bolaji Carew led a "mutiny" against the
confraternity. Dissatisfied with the conduct of the organization, he and several other
members formed a rival group known as the Buccaneers Confraternity, borrowing many of
the structures, ceremonies, and symbology from the Pyrates Confraternity. Because of this
fracture, the Pyrates registered the name "National Association of Seadogs," while the
Buccaneers refer to themselves as "Sea Lords."
Over the years, infighting led to further factions and spin-off groups, resulting in dozens of
organizations. While some of the older confraternities focus on humanitarian efforts,
subsequent splinter groups have strayed from those traditional values. The groups are often
referred to as "campus cults," and students are warned about the dangers of joining them.
Many exhibit gang-like activity and align with local militant groups. They have engaged in
armed robbery, kidnapping, operating prostitution rings, and cybercrime.

[1] Cash to master services involve a representative from a cash to master company meeting
a ship upon its arrival into its destination port and paying the ship's captain, who then pays
crewmembers their wages, historically in cash accompanied by armed guards. In exchange,
the cash to master company receives a service fee.
