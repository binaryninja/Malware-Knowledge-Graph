SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM

i

INTRODUCTION
The Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) June
2016 announcement attributing its network breach
to the Russian Government triggered an international
debate over Russia’s sponsorship of information
operations against the U.S.
At issue is the question of proof: did the Russian Government direct the group
responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter
of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the DNC breach part
of a concerted effort by the Russian Government to interfere with the U.S.
presidential election?
Unfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will
Russia continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks,
to undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the Russian Government
perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims?
Our visibility into the operations of APT28 - a group we believe the Russian
Government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government’s
targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.
We have tracked and profiled this group through multiple investigations, endpoint
and network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28’s
operations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group’s
malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical
to protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening
our confidence in attributing APT28 to the Russian Government.

OVERVIEW
On December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis
Report confirming FireEye’s long held public assessment that the Russian
Government sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged
in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests.
The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and prolific
set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on
defense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily
targeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former
Soviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches,
media entities, and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian
Government.
Over the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged
APT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader
strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization,
APT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political
narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included
the conflict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee
and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete
doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored
hacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This report details our observations of APT28’s
targeting, and our investigation into a related
breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the
group’s tool development and use, and summarize
the tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims.

APT28 TARGETING AND
INTRUSION ACTIVITY
In October 2014, FireEye released APT28: A Window into
Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized
APT28’s activity as aligning with the Russian Government’s
strategic intelligence requirements. While tracking APT28,
we noted the group’s interest in foreign governments and
militaries, particularly those of European and Eastern
European nations, as well as regional security organizations,
such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), among others. Table 1 highlights
some recent examples of this activity.

Since 2014, APT28 network activity has likely supported
information operations designed to influence the domestic
politics of foreign nations. Some of these operations have
involved the disruption and defacement of websites, false flag
operations using false hacktivist personas, and the theft of
data that was later leaked publicly online.

Table 2 highlights incidents in which victims suffered
a compromise that FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence, other
authorities, or the victims themselves later attributed to the
group we track as APT28. All of these operations have aimed
to achieve a similar objective: securing a political outcome
beneficial to Russia.

SEPTEMBER 2016

On September 13, WADA confirmed that APT28
had compromised its networks and accessed
athlete medical data. 8

On September 12, 2016, the “Fancy Bears’ Hack Team” persona
claimed to have compromised WADA and released athletes’
medical records as “proof of American athletes taking doping.” 9

APRIL –
SEPTEMBER 2016

The DNC announced it had suffered a network
compromise and that a subsequent investigation
found evidence of two breaches, attributed to
APT28 and APT29. FireEye analyzed the malware found on DNC networks and determined
that it was consistent with our previous observations of APT28 tools.10,11

In June 2016, shortly after the DNC’s announcement, the Guccifer 2.0 persona claimed responsibility for the DNC breach
and leaked documents taken from the organization’s network.
Guccifer 2.0 continued to leak batches of DNC documents
through September.12,13

MARCH –
NOVEMBER 2016

Investigators found that John Podesta, Hillary
Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, was
one of thousands of individuals targeted in a
mass phishing scheme using shortened URLs
that security researchers attributed to APT28.14

Throughout October and into early November, WikiLeaks published 34 batches of email correspondence stolen from John
Podesta’s personal email account. Correspondence of other
individuals targeted in the same phishing campaign, including
former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Clinton campaign
staffer William Rinehart, were published on the
“DC Leaks” website.15

U.S. Democratic
Congressional Campaign
Committee (DCCC)

MARCH OCTOBER 2016

In July, the DCCC announced that it was investigating an ongoing “cybersecurity incident” that
the FBI believed was linked to the compromise
of the DNC. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
later confirmed that the DCCC had suffered a
network compromise. Investigators indicated
that the actors may have gained access to DCCC
systems as early as March.16,17,18

In August, the Guccifer 2.0 persona contacted reporters covering U.S. House of Representative races to announce newly
leaked documents from the DCCC pertaining to Democratic
candidates. From August to October, Guccifer 2.0 posted several additional installments of what appear to be internal DCCC
documents on “his” WordPress site.19,20

TV5Monde

FEBRUARY 2015,
APRIL 2015

In February, FireEye identified CORESHELL
traffic beaconing from TV5Monde’s network,
confirming that APT28 had compromised TV5Monde’s network.

In April 2015, alleged pro-ISIS hacktivist group CyberCaliphate
defaced TV5Monde’s websites and social media profiles and
forced the company’s 11 broadcast channels offline. FireEye
identified overlaps between the domain registration details of
CyberCaliphate’s website and APT28 infrastructure. 21

Ukrainian officials revealed that the investigation
into the compromise of the CEC’s internal network identified malware traced to APT28. 22

During the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, purported
pro-Russian hacktivists CyberBerkut conducted a series of malicious activities against the CEC including a system compromise,
data destruction, a data leak, a distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack, and an attempted defacement of the CEC website with fake election results. 23

FROM OLYMPIC SLIGHT TO DATA LEAK:

Investigating APT28 at the World Anti-Doping Agency
As news of the DNC breach spread, APT28 was preparing for another set
of operations: countering the condemnation that Russia was facing after
doping allegations and a threatened blanket ban of the Russian team
from the upcoming Rio Games. Russia, like many nations, has long viewed
success in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft
power on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban
from the Games further ostracized Russia, and likely provided motivation
to actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping
agencies and policies. Our investigation of APT28’s compromise of
WADA’s network, and our observations of the surrounding events reveal
how Russia sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize
the institutions leveling criticism.

CONCLUSION
Since releasing our 2014 report, we continue to assess that
APT28 is sponsored by the Russian Government. We further
assess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network
compromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities
related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. These
breaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails
– that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums
and propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly
intended to advance particular Russian Government aims. In
a report released on January 7 2017, the U.S. Directorate of
National Intelligence described this activity as an “influence
campaign.”
This influence campaign - a combination of network
compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely
with the Russian military’s publicly stated intentions and
capabilities. Influence operations, also frequently called
“information operations,” have a long history of inclusion
in Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally
developed, deployed, and modernized with the advent of
the internet. The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of
many instances of Russian Government influence operations
conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it
will not be the last. As the 2017 elections in Europe approach
- most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands - we
are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts.

APPENDIX:

APT28’s Tools, Tactics, and Operational Changes
In our 2014 report, we identified APT28 as a suspected Russian
government-sponsored espionage actor. We came to this conclusion
in part based on forensic details left in the malware that APT28 had
employed since at least 2007. We have provided an updated version of
those conclusions, a layout of the tactics that they generally employ,
as well as observations of apparent tactical shifts. For full details,
please reference our 2014 report, APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber
Espionage Operations?
APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group’s
plans for continued operations, as well as the group’s access to resources
and skilled developers.
Key characteristics of APT28’s toolset include:
• A flexible, modular framework that has allowed APT28
to consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007.
• Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop
tools, allowing the group to create and deploy custom
modules within its backdoors.
• Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including
runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated
strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused
machine instructions to slow analysis.
• Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow
time zone and within a Russian language build environment.

APT28’S OPERATIONAL CHANGES SINCE 2014
APT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and refine its tactics
in what is almost certainly an effort to protect its operational
effectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and
scrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group’s
first stage tools, we have also noted APT28:
• Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player,
Java, and Windows, including CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2015-2424,
CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-3043, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE2015-7645.
• Using a profiling script to deploy zero-days and other
tools more selectively, decreasing the chance that researchers
and others will gain access to the group’s tools.
• Increasing reliance on public code depositories, such
as Carberp, PowerShell Empire, P.A.S. webshell, Metasploit
modules, and others in a likely effort to accelerate their
development cycle and provide plausible deniability.
• Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google
App authorization and Oauth access requests that allow
the group to bypass two-factor authentication and other
security measures.
• Moving laterally through a network relying only
on legitimate tools that already exist within the victims’
systems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the
duration of the compromise.

These changes are not only indicative of APT28’s skills,
resourcefulness, and desire to maintain operational
effectiveness, but also highlight the longevity of the
group’s mission and its intent to continue its activities
for the foreseeable future.

APT28 TACTICS
We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting
to compromise intended targets. These include sending spear-phishing
emails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto
a user’s systems, or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the
recipients’ email credentials and provide access to the their accounts.
APT28 has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites
intending to infect site visitors, and has gained access to organizations by
compromising their web-facing servers
