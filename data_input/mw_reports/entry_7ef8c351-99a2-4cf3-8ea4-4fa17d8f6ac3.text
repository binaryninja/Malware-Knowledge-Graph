Research by Ashwin Vamshi and Abhijit Mohanta
Quick-Look Summary:
IcedID appears to be taking the place of Emotet, based on a significant influx of
samples in our threat intelligence systems
A majority of these IcedID samples are distributed via xlsm files attached to emails
We’ve identified three ways these Excel 4 Macros are evading detection
Uptycs’ threat research team has observed an ongoing IcedID campaign heavily using
Microsoft Excel xlsm documents with Excel 4 Macros and techniques to hinder analysis.
Xlsm supports the embedding of Excel 4.0 Macros formulas used in Excel spreadsheet cells.
Attackers leverage this functionality to embed arbitrary commands, which usually download a
malicious payload from the URL using the formulas in the document.
In this piece, we’ll provide an analysis on our discovery of the ongoing campaign via Uptycs’
threat intelligence.

IcedID
IcedID, also known as BokBot, is a modular banking trojan that targets user financial
information and is capable of acting as a dropper for other malware. In a three month span,
we have observed over 15,000 HTTP requests from malicious documents, the majority of
which were Microsoft Excel spreadsheets carrying an extension. Based on this increasing
trend, we believe that IcedID will emerge as an incarnation of Emotet after its disruption.
IcedID has also been recently reported to deploy ransomware operations, moving towards a
malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model to distribute malware.

Threat Intelligence Analysis
Our in-house threat intelligence systems provide us intelligence on the latest threats, threat
actors and campaigns through an osquery-based sandbox. The threat research team
regularly monitors these systems to ensure robust coverage, also ingesting the latest
intelligence and indicators into our integrated Threat Intelligence provided in the Uptycs
Security Analytics Platform.
From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, we identified over 15,000 HTTP requests
from over 4,000 similar malicious documents (see Figure 1).

Figure 1: Threat Intelligence system HTTP requests cluster. (Click to see larger version.)
93% of these malicious office documents belong to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file
carrying extensions xls or xlsm (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Malicious document types.
The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files (.xlsm, xls) were carrying the names:
overdue
claim
calculation
inform
refusal
complaint and compensation claim
These files appeared with randomly appended names like
Claim_331903057_03292021.xlsm.
The http request of the malicious documents consisted of a second stage executable file (PE
- EXE/DLL) with a fake extension dat, jpg and gif (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Second stage PE file with fake extensions like dat,gif and jpg.
The fake extensions were the second stage payload of Qakbot and IcedID malware families.
Qakbot and IcedID are generally distributed via email lures containing malicious office
documents as an attachment. The next stage executables (PE - EXE/DLL) are downloaded
via compromised websites with fake extensions.

Technical Analysis: XLSM files Excel 4.0 Macros
A majority of these Microsoft Excel spreadsheet documents were in xlsm format. One such
xlsm document that recently hit our in-house osquery-based sandbox was titled,
“Claim_331903057_03292021.xlsm” (Hash 43226874cd34010fa7c8286974174b5e261677ed0b48ed0632903112f68720a8).
Upon execution, the xlsm file presented a message to enable content to view the message.

larger version.)
Enabling the content allows the embedded Excel 4 macro formulas to execute. Upon
investigation we identified three interesting techniques used to hinder analysis:
1. Hiding macro formulas in three different sheets
2. Masking the macro formula using a white font on white background
3. Shrinking the cell contents and making the original content invisible

Upon unmasking the anti-analysis techniques, the Excel 4 macro formula used for
downloading the IcedID loader payloads was revealed.

Figure 6: Unhidden XLM 4 macros - the IcedID payload URL’s. (Click to see larger version.)
The macros which are distributed across various cells download three DLL files with the .dat
extension from the command-and-control (C2) servers to “C:\Users\Admin” - Hodas.vyur,
Hodas.vyur1 and Hodas.vyur2. These DLL files are executed using - "rundll32 DllName,
DllRegisterServer".
The IcedID loader then retrieves information about the victim PC and sends it over the C2
server in an encoded form, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.

The http headers translate to the following:
_gat= NativeSystemInfo
_u= UserName
_gid= AdaptersInfo
__io=AccountName
Uptycs’ EDR capabilities detected this attack with a threat score of 10/10 as shown in the
figure below.

7/9

Given our recent observations, we believe that IcedID will emerge as an incarnation of
Emotet, moving towards a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model to distribute malware. We
recommend the following measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify and
protect against such attacks:
Deploy a multi-layered and real-time detection solution to label, classify, score and
prioritizes incidents.
Regularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned on
the execution of any suspicious documents arriving from untrusted sources.
Always be cautious in opening documents from unknown or untrusted sources.
Keep systems updated with the latest releases and patches.
