TA575 Uses ‘Squid Game’ Lures to Distribute Dridex malware

2/7

October 28, 2021 Axel F and Selena Larson
Proofpoint identified the large cybercrime actor TA575 distributing Dridex malware using Squid
Game lures. The threat actor is purporting to be entities associated with the Netflix global
phenomenon using emails enticing targets to get early access to a new season of Squid Game or to
become a part of the TV show casting.
On October 27, 2021, Proofpoint observed thousands of emails targeting all industries primarily in the
United States. The emails used subjects such as:
Squid Game is back, watch new season before anyone else.
Invite for Customer to access the new sesason. [sic]
Squid game new season commercials casting preview
Squid game scheduled season commercials talent cast schedule

show or show commercials
The emails tell the victim to fill out either an attached document to get early access to the new season
of the show or a talent form to become part of the background casting. The attachments are Excel
documents with macros that, if enabled, will download the Dridex banking trojan affiliate id “22203”
from Discord URLs. Dridex is a prolific banking trojan distributed by multiple affiliates that can lead to
data theft and installation of follow-on malware such as ransomware.

TA575 is a Dridex affiliate tracked by Proofpoint since late 2020. This group distributes malware via
malicious URLs, Microsoft Office attachments, and password-protected files. On average, TA575
sends thousands of emails per campaign impacting hundreds of organizations. TA575 also uses the
Discord content delivery network (CDN) to host and distribute Dridex. Discord, a communications
platform with consumer and enterprise uses, is an increasingly popular malware hosting service for
cybercriminals.
TA575 themes generally include invoicing and payments, but occasionally include popular news,
events, and cultural references. Cybercriminal threat actors in general have pounced on Squid Game
as a popular lure and malware theme. This makes sense; as Squid Game is Netflix’s “biggest ever”
series, the pool of potential victims who would inadvertently interact with malicious content associated
with it is higher than a general lure theme. TA575 is betting the invitation to be part of the upcoming
season will entice more users to interact with the malicious Microsoft Excel file.
