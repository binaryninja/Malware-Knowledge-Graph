November 18, 2021

Ever wonder what happens when some of yesterday’s most crippling ransomware or RAT
attacks evolve? That’s what we unpack in this month’s Cybersecurity Threat Spotlight. Our
three cyberattacks wreak havoc by borrowing some of the most effective techniques and
tools formerly used by DarkSide, REvil, LockBit, and the PlugX RAT.
We break down this evolution in today’s blog, and discuss the ways in which you can protect
your network in an on-demand webinar.

Threat Name: BlackMatter
Threat Type: Ransomware
Attack Chain:

1/8

Description: BlackMatter ransomware is both a ransomware variant and a ransomware-asa-service, borrowing techniques and tools from DarkSide and REvil RaaS platforms and from
LockBit 2.0 ransomware. One interesting change in BlackMatter from similar variants is that
it will encrypt Russian systems.
First appearing in July, 2021, BlackMatter appears to be the next generation of DarkSide,
REvil, and LockBit 2.0, using the best techniques from each to be more effective at achieving
its goals. The name BlackMatter applies to its operators, its use as a Ransomware-as-aService (RaaS), and the artifacts used in infections.
The operators have a presence on TOR, where they claim transparency with victims,
recovery companies, and journalists while providing a list of verticals they do not target.
Many similarities between BlackMatter, DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit 2.0 exist. These include
being provided as RaaS, multi-threading, in-place file encryption, and similar ransom desktop
wallpaper on victim machines. Some of the notable differences with BlackMatter include a
larger encryption size of 1,024 KB and the fact that it will encrypt Russian-language systems.
The ransom notes are similar to what has been observed in DarkSide infections in regard to
file size, image format, and appearance. BlackMatter uses Initial Access Brokers, individuals
or groups who are willing to sell access to compromised networks while also recruiting
affiliates to deliver ransomware for a portion of the ransom payments. Variants exist for
Windows and Linux, affecting Windows Server 2003 and later and Windows 7 and later on
x86 and x64 architectures. Affected Linux versions include VMWare ESXI, Ubuntu, Debian,
and CentOS.
Initial access is via compromised remote desktop, phishing, the use of stolen credentials, or
exploitation of vulnerabilities in web browsers or operating systems. When a system is
infected with BlackMatter, the privilege of the current user is verified and an attempt to
escalate occurs. Processes are terminated to close any running programs that might prevent
encryption of files, shadow volume copies are deleted, data is exfiltrated, and the files on the
system are encrypted. During encryption, files are opened, checked to determine if they were
already encrypted, renamed with a new extension, and partially encrypted. Then, data to
indicate the file was encrypted is added and the file is closed. Access permissions for
encrypted files are changed to ‘All’. Victims who choose to pay the ransom to recover files

are unable to restore the original access permissions. If unable to run due to endpoint
protection, BlackMatter will reboot a Windows system in safe mode. To inhibit analysis, string
information in malware artifacts are encrypted and only decrypted while running in memory.

Threat Name: LockBit
Threat Type: Ransomware
Attack Chain:

Description: LockBit ransomware was first seen in 2019. A second version, called LockBit
2.0, appeared in July, 2021 and operates as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). It shares
features with Ryuk and Egregor ransomware families, such as Wake-on-LAN and Print
Bombing (sending the ransom note to connected printers). LockBit operators use doubleextortion methods and attempt to recruit affiliates from within the targeted organizations.
Automatic encryption on victim systems occurs across Windows domains by abusing Active
Directory policies. LockBit uses multithreading for encryption and only partially encrypts files
to increase speed.
Originally known as the .abcd virus, the first version of LockBit was able to self-replicate,
performed host discovery using ARP tables, and would move laterally by exploiting SMB on
Windows systems. It would spread via PowerShell and avoided encrypting Russianlanguage systems.
A new version of LockBit, called LockBit 2.0, began appearing in late 2019. The wallpaper
that was set on victim systems would attempt to recruit internal affiliates or members of the
victim organization to help further the infection and provide additional data for exfiltration in
exchange for payment. LockBit 2.0 also attempted to recruit outside affiliates by advertising
faster encryption speed than the first version of LockBit as well as other Ransomware

4/8

variants. Delivery is typically via phishing, where a dropper is installed. C2 communication
begins shortly after and additional tools are downloaded. Data exfiltration then occurs,
followed by data encryption.
Once LockBit is installed on a system, Cobalt Strike and remote access tools are also
installed. Some of these tools are legitimate, which helps to avoid detection. Data is then
exfiltrated for additional ransom if payment is not made. LockBit 2.0 samples employ antianalysis techniques similar to BlackMatter, where strings are encrypted until runtime.
Shadow volume copies are deleted on victim systems prior to encryption. When encrypting
files, the extension is changed to .lockbit and a custom icon is set to display for that file type.
It then looks for connected drives and network volumes, creates a ransom note in all
directories, encrypts the files, and changes the desktop background to a ransom message.
One of the final steps is to print the ransom note to any connected printers.

Threat Name: THOR
Threat Type: RAT
Attack Chain:

Description: THOR is a variant of the PlugX Remote Access Tool (RAT). PlugX RATs have
been in use since 2008 and have the ability to upload, download, and modify files, perform
keystroke logging, webcam control, and provide access to a remote shell. THOR is unique
from previous PlugX variants in that it changed the word ‘PLUG’ to ‘THOR’ in its source
code. It is further differentiated from past PlugX RATs by its use of modified payload delivery
mechanisms and the use of trusted binaries on a victim system to accomplish its goals. It
first appeared in March, 2021 as part of an attack on Exchange Servers via CVE-202126855 and CVE-2021-27065.

6/8

THOR Spotlight: THOR is a new variant of the PlugX malware, which has been involved in
targeted attacks and intrusions since 2008. PlugX is often installed as a second-stage
implant following the initial infection. It’s built for modular use, allowing the use of plug-ins to
achieve specific objectives. Delivery is via malicious documents in phishing emails and C2
communication occurs after infection. Additional components may be downloaded after
communication begins.
In March of 2019, two zero-day exploits (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065) were
discovered affecting Microsoft Exchange Servers. These exploits were used to upload a
webshell to a publicly accessible web directory, allowing code execution, the ability to write
malicious files to any path, run commands, escalate privilege, and allow remote access. In
the attacks, a variant of PlugX was being used to install a remote access tool. This variant
had a modification in its source code, changing a well-known variable name from PLUG to
THOR.
When run, a legitimate Windows binary is used to download a dropper, which is designed to
remain undetected and can only be run with a specific loader. All variants of PlugX require
the use of DLL side-loading to run. The downloaded dropper has its first 1000 bytes filled
with random padding until it has a NULL byte, signaling the beginning of the file. When
loaded into memory, the code unpacks and communication with a command and control (C2)
server begins.
When running, THOR behaves the same as previous PlugX variants, decrypting hard-coded
and embedded configuration settings. Communication with the C2 server is over ports 80,
443, 53, and 8000 using UDP and TCP. While the first handshake with the C2 looks like
HTTP data, it is made of random bytes with variable lengths. If the return value from the C2
is the correct length, actual HTTP communication between the victim and C2 starts. Various
values in the C2 traffic are hard-coded, such as the user-agent and a known PlugX constant.
When installation is complete, a Windows system service named HP Digital Image is created
and system events are logged to a hidden file labeled NTUSER.dat. The MZ and PE headers
of the running module are removed and replaced with ROHT, which is THOR written
backwards.
The primary goals of THOR and other PlugX variants are to monitor, make changes, and
interact with the system, as well as to install additional malware.
