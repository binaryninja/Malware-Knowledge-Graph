Multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop ransomware cartel have been detained in
Ukraine this week after a joint operation from law enforcement agencies from Ukraine, South
Korea, and the US.
The arrests, reported today by the Ukraine National Police and the country’s Cyber Police
division, come after authorities conducted searches at 21 residences in Kyiv, the country’s
capital, and nearby regions.
Following the operation, authorities reported that they successfully shut down server
infrastructure used by the gang members to launch past attacks.
Computers, smartphones, and server equipment were seized, together with 5 million
Ukrainian hryvnias ($185,000), which authorities believe were obtained from ransoming
companies across the world.

Several expensive cars, such as Tesla, Mercedes, and Lexus models, were also seized from
the gang members’ homes.

Authorities said they arrested six members of the Clop group, but did not expand on their
role in the overall Clop gang structure. If found guilty, the suspects face up to eight years in
prison.

A short history of Clop
Prior to today’s arrests, incidents with the Clop ransomware have been documented as early
as February 2019.
The gang is what security researchers would call a “big-game hunter,” a term that describes
ransomware groups that go only after large IT networks rather than home consumers.
Across its more than two years of activity, the Clop gang has breached many large
corporations and demanded payments of up to tens of millions of US dollars per victim.
If companies refused to pay, the Clop gang would resort to a double-extortion tactic and
threaten to leak victims’ data on a dark web “leak portal.” The leak site is still up and running
at the time of writing.

A November 2020 Fox-IT report claimed the Clop gang had close ties to a malware
distribution group known as TA505, which would often allow the gang’s members to deploy
Clop ransomware strains on computers previously infected with the SDBbot malware.
A February 2021 FireEye report also claimed the Clop gang appears to have struck a deal
with the FIN11 cybercrime group, allowing FIN11 operators to list data the group previously
stole from hacked Accellion FTA file-sharing devices.

Clop’s South Korean victims get their revenge
The arrests come in investigations that started back in 2019 when the Clop ransomware
gang breached four South Korean companies and encrypted their files, asking for huge
payouts.
Sources close to the investigation have told The Record that South Korean police ramped up
its investigation into the gang last year after the Clop gang infected the network of South
Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November 2020, forcing the Korean company to close
almost have of its stores.
In a rare practice, South Korean police officers were physically present during the raids on
Clop suspects this week, something that is customarily left to local law enforcement
agencies.
