Mamba Ransomware Weaponizing DiskCryptor
Summary
Mamba ransomware has been deployed against local governments,
public transportation agencies, legal services, technology services,
industrial, commercial, manufacturing, and construction businesses.
Mamba ransomware weaponizes DiskCryptor—an open source full
disk encryption software— to restrict victim access by encrypting an
entire drive, including the operating system. DiskCryptor is not
inherently malicious but has been weaponized. Once encrypted, the
system displays a ransom note including the actor’s email address,
ransomware file name, the host system name, and a place to enter the
decryption key. Victims are instructed to contact the actor’s email
address to pay the ransom in exchange for the decryption key.

Technical Details
The ransomware program consists of the open source, off-the-shelf, disk encryption software
DiskCryptor wrapped in a program which installs and starts disk encryption in the background using
a key of the attacker’s choosing. The attacker passes the encryption key via the command-line
parameter: [Ransomware Filename].exe <password>. The ransomware extracts a set of
files and installs an encryption service. The ransomware program restarts the system about two
minutes after installation of DiskCryptor to complete driver installation. The encryption key and the
shutdown time variable are saved to the configuration file (myConf.txt) and is readable until the
second restart about two hours later which concludes the encryption and displays the ransom note.
If any of the DiskCryptor files are detected, attempts should be made to determine if the myConf.txt
is still accessible. If so, then the password can be recovered without paying the ransom. This
opportunity is limited to the point in which the system reboots for the second time.

Recommended Mitigations
• Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data
resides.
• Implement network segmentation.
• Require administrator credentials to install software.
• If DiskCryptor is not used by the organization, add the key artifact files used by DiskCryptor to
the organization’s execution blacklist. Any attempts to install or run this encryption program
and its associated files should be prevented.
• Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage
device, the cloud).
• Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are
released.
• Use multifactor authentication where possible.
• Regularly, change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing passwords
for different accounts. Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
• Disable unused remote access/RDP ports and monitor remote access/RDP logs.
• Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least
privilege in mind.
• Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
• Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using
a VPN.

• Consider adding an email banner to messages coming from outside your organizations.
• Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
• Focus on awareness and training. Provide users with training on information security
principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities
(i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).
Reporting Notice
The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It
may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors
to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI
understands that when victims are faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to
protect shareholders, employees and customers. Regardless of whether your organization decided
to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime
Complaint Center (IC3) (https://ic3.gov). Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed
to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them
accountable under U.S. law.
