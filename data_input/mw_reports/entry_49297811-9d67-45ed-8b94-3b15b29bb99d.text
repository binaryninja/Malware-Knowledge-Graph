INTRODUCTION
Dragos is excited to present the fifth year of the annual Dragos
Year In Review report on Industrial Control System (ICS)/
Operational Technology (OT) cyber threats, vulnerabilities,
assessments, and incident response observations. The ICS/
OT* community has long suffered from more anecdotes on
security than insights driven from data and real-world cases
given the sensitivity of the subject. A lack of insights into
the ICS/OT threat landscape and state of security prevent the
community from having meaningful discussions on how to
address today’s challenges. The Dragos Year in Review report
was launched with the intent to add ground-truth reality into
the discussion as an attempt to move the conversation and
security efforts forward.
In 2021, the industrial community attracted high-profile
attention. Headlines range from the compromise of a water
treatment facility with intent to poison its community, to a
ransomware attack against a pipeline operator that disrupted
gas supplies to the southeastern United States. These reports
underscored the potentially devastating outcomes a security
breach of infrastructure could have on communities and
a country’s economy. Beyond these public examples, there
are numerous other matters that were never made public.
Industrial organizations are becoming aware that they no
longer fully understand the security risks surrounding their
most important assets – their ICS/OT environments.
This report captures how a portion of the industrial
community is performing and progressing, and highlights
the areas that need improvement to provide safe, reliable
operations into 2022 and beyond.

*

The terms “ICS” and “OT” will be used interchangeably for the purpose of this report. These terms are used differently in different communities.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
ACTIVITY GROUPS

RANSOMWARE FINDINGS

65%
KOSTOVITE

PETROVITE

Manufacturing
accounted for 65%
of all ransomware
attacks.

ERYTHRITE

Dragos discovered three new activity
groups with the assessed motivation
of targeting ICS/OT.

51%

Two ransomware
groups caused 51
percent of attacks
(Lockbit 2.0 and
Conti).

Two of the groups have achieved Stage 2 of
the ICS Cyber Kill Chain showing their ability
to get access directly to ICS/OT networks.**

SERVICE ENGAGEMENT FINDINGS

86% of service
engagements
have a lack of
visibility across
OT networks —
making detections,
triage, and
response incredibly
difficult at scale.

70% of service
engagements
included a finding
of external
connections from
OEMs, IT networks,
or the internet to
the OT network.

44% of service
engagements
included a finding
about shared
credentials in OT
systems, the most
common method of
lateral movement
and privilege
escalation.

The ICS Cyber Kill Chain breaks intrusions into Stage 1 and Stage 2 operations. Stage 1 are IT network compromises where the adversary
appears to have a goal of getting into the ICS/OT networks of the company but has not achieved this yet. Stage 2 operations are those
where the adversary has gained access to ICS/OT networks. At the completion of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain an adversary conducts disruptive or
destructive operations. The paper can be found here.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
VULNERABILITY ADVISORY FINDINGS

More than twice
as many common
vulnerabilities and
exposures (CVE)
were published in
2021 than in 2020.

38% of ICS
vulnerability
advisories
contained errors
that would make it
difficult to prioritize
mitigations.

Dragos provided
mitigation advice
that was missing
for 69% of
advisories.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

35% of the

IN THE HEADLINES
When
OT Cyber
Disruption
Leads to Panic
and Economic
Shutdown

The DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline
highlighted the impact of an attack on pipelines to
the broader public. Colonial Pipeline is the largest fuel
pipeline in the U.S. and delivers approximately 45
percent of the gasoline consumed on the U.S. East Coast.
Colonial Pipeline halted its pipeline operations to contain
the ransomware attack to its IT operations and ensure
the safety of the public. The resulting shutdown caused
gas shortages and panic-buying by the public, and the
Transportation Security Agency (TSA) introduced new
regulations for the pipeline community.
With Colonial Pipeline’s billing system compromised, the
decision to shut down the entire pipeline was made to
isolate and contain the attack and help ensure the adversary
did not spread to the Operational Technology (OT) network
controlling pipeline operations. This was an appropriate
and safety-focused decision. Greater visibility into the OT
networks would have better armed Colonial Pipeline in their
decision-making process, but their actions ensured that no
one was hurt.

FRONTLINE PERSPECTIVE

77%
of oil & gas architectures had
external connections to OT
segments.

66%
of oil & gas potential process
impacts involved a loss
of availability (through
ransomware or other means).

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

Colonial Pipeline engaged the FBI and Mandiant for the
IT efforts and Dragos for the OT security work to ensure
Colonial would be in a good place in the future. Lessons
learned for organizations include: Ensure that key incident
response questions and answers are identified before a
security incident to determine if the organization will be
comfortable continuing operations. Questions and answers
on OT security efforts, incident response planning, and data
collection strategies will drive preparedness.
For governments, lessons learned from the regulation should
be that the wholesale adoption of IT security controls into
OT environments can be ill-suited at best and disruptive at
worst. The TSA regulations included some requirements
that would not reduce the risk of cyber threats to pipeline
infrastructure and, if followed completely, would likely result
in outages. Governments and regulators should work closely
with the asset owner and operator community, as well as
industry subject matter experts to ensure that the security
controls put forward are tailored to the risks and appropriate
for industrial automation environments.

When
Ransomware
Attacks
Endanger
the Nation’s
Food Supply

In May 2021, the ransomware group REvil breached the
computer networks of JBS Foods, one of the largest beef
suppliers in the world with meatpacking facilities in the
U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and Mexico. According to
reports, the ransomware was detected in JBS’s Sao Paulo
operation, targeting critical infrastructure within the
organization. In recent years, REvil has attacked multiple
organizations by encrypting their files and demanding
Bitcoin payments in exchange for decryptors and the
assurance they will not leak stolen information.
After the attack, JBS Foods shut down many of its
operations and then paid $11 million in Bitcoin ransom.
Externally, Dragos uncovered and enumerated the
networks associated with more than a dozen JBS facilities
worldwide. Dragos found what appeared to be the
exfiltration of gigabytes of data on the popular file storage
service Mega from a network associated with the JBS’s
office in Brisbane, Australia.
Dragos uncovered that this exfiltration tactic is consistent
with previous reports of ransomware operators that
use the open-source transfer tool Rclone, combined
with Mega, to stage its stolen data. Dragos observed test
connections to Mega on March 4 and 5, 2021, with a large
upload on March 7. The next batch of multiple gigabytes
took place on April 9. The final batch was uploaded on
May 30, the same day that JBS reported the cyber attack.
The crucial ability to detect an adversary’s exfiltration
activities can disrupt the encryption phase of such
ransomware attacks.

When you consider that JBS supplies almost a quarter of the U.S. with its meat products,
there are important lessons to learn from this cyber attack:
• In-depth knowledge of how IT and OT infrastructure overlaps and is connected will
enable teams to quickly identify and isolate infected systems.
• Identifying the strain of the malware and how it is impacting systems will help prevent
further spread.
• Identifying the data that was compromised during an attack is critical for determining
its value to the organization, as well as the dependencies to the data that may impact
operations.
• A robust backup plan is key for disaster recovery efforts. With JBS, they shut down
operations to contain the attack and decrease the overall damage.

The cyber attack on the Oldsmar water system in
Florida on February 5, 2021, demonstrated the potential
risks to municipal water systems throughout the
world. During a press conference, the City of Oldsmar
announced there was an unlawful intrusion into the
City’s water treatment system and that an adversary
attempted to poison the water supply.

a significant increase from the
normal amount of 100 ppm. The operator saw the remotely
controlled mouse movements on the HMI and acted quickly.
The actions of the operators and personnel at Oldsmar were
commendable and prevented any risk to the public. However,
organizations will not always be lucky enough to observe
overt actions by adversaries. Historically, many industrial
organizations have invested heavily in prevention. They
must also invest heavily in the ability to detect, respond,
and recover with technology and personnel. Unfortunately,
for many smaller utilities, such as some municipal water
systems, economics can prevent such investments. It is not
uncommon for smaller utilities to share their IT staff or have
contractors versus a full-time cybersecurity staff.
Until the economic conditions change, such as government
financial support, the cybersecurity maturity of the smaller
utilities is unlikely to change.

IN THE HEADLINES
When the
U.S. Food
Supply Chain
Became a
Target

In mid-September 2021, the ransomware group
BlackMatter attacked New Cooperative, an association
of Iowa corn and soybean farmers, and demanded a $5.9
million ransom payment for a decryptor. The attack
was more evidence that infrastructure and the U.S. food
supply chain had become targets. New Cooperative
claimed that the breached software governed the feeding
schedules of 11 million farm animals and 40 percent of
their grain production. Blackmatter, the ransomware
group previously known as Darkside, had claimed that
they would “avoid targeting critical infrastructure,” yet
their actions did not reflect their public statements.
New Cooperative, its 60+ locations, and other U.S.
farming and grain co-ops found themselves the target
of ransomware groups. Dark web forums suggested that
adversaries had exfiltrated 1000 GB of New Cooperative’s
data; however, Dragos could not identify that exfiltration
of data from New Cooperative’s network had occurred as
the adversary claimed. On September 23, the Minnesotabased Crystal Valley Cooperative announced it was also hit
with ransomware, which forced the company offline and
disrupted its business operations.
Later in October, the ransomware group BlackByte allegedly
attacked a second Iowa cooperative called Farmer’s
Cooperative Elevator Co. The threat group threatened to
release 100 gigabytes of data that included financial, sales,
and accounting information if the ransom was not paid.
Historically, it is unusual for adversaries to target farmer
co-ops. This series of attacks illustrates that industrial
targets like farmer co-ops, once thought of as unlikely
victims, can become prime targets without notice. U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has urged cooperatives
to strengthen their defenses against cyber attacks to avoid
disruptions to the nation’s harvest.

2021 Threat
Activity

Key Updates on Activity Groups
During 2021, cyber risk to industrial sectors grew and accelerated, largely led
by ransomware. Dragos emphasizes the importance of understanding how
adversaries gain access and steal information to better prepare for threats
in the future. Adversaries tend to build their operations and capabilities
methodically over time; their previous efforts often determine their future
success.
Dragos tracks threats, also identified as activity groups, which show the
intent, opportunity, or capability of impacting industrial operations. Some
of these threats have shown the intent and capability to disrupt operations
and even cause destructive effects. These threats may be in the early
stages of their journey, and have only shown the intent to target industrial
organizations by attempting to gain access to ICS/OT networks or collecting
organizational information.
Dragos tracks a number of groups that have targeted industrial networks,
but do not show the intention of disrupting them—this is much more
common in reality than is publicly reported. Adversaries may do this for
intellectual property theft, capability development for future attacks, or simply
gaining and maintaining access for future undetermined needs. In some
cases, adversaries gain access to the IT networks of an organization or its
supply chain to get information about the ICS of the target. As an example,
engineering drawings are useful in both intellectual property theft and
disruptive capability development but would not usually be stored in the ICS
networks of the company. These drawings would more likely be stored in the
IT networks of that company’s integrator. Although not every compromise
will relate to an impact today, many can inform the attacks of the future.
Currently, Dragos tracks 18 worldwide threat groups, with three of the newest
groups discovered during 2021. Two of the new Activity Groups, KOSTOVITE
and ERYTHRITE, demonstrate Stage 2 ICS Cyber Kill Chain1 intrusions with
a focus on access operations and data theft over disruption. This shows
that adversaries are willing to spend time, effort, and resources targeting,
compromising, and harvesting information from ICS/OT environments for
future purposes.

Updates on Previously
Known Activity Groups
Throughout 2020, the Activity Groups identified prior to 2021
remained active against industrial organizations. While already
covered in previous Year in Review reports, the following key
activities occurred in 2021 that are worth noting:

STIBNITE
From late 2019 through early 2020, the Activity Group STIBNITE emerged with
its first phase of Stage 1 industrial infrastructure intrusions. STIBNITE initially
focused on IT intrusion and information gathering on wind turbine companies
that generate electric power in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is near the Caucasus
region, an area that is a significant source of energy for Europe.
In February 2021, STIBNITE targeted Azerbaijani environmental science,
technology, and industrial engineering experts, researchers, and practitioners
interested in technical conferences. STIBNITE sent victims spear-phishing
emails about such events as a first lure and attempt at installing a new version
of PoetRAT written in .NET. A month later, STIBNITE used a State Oil Company
of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) spear-phishing lure targeting the Azerbaijan
Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The STIBNITE spear-phishing
emails all contained a downloadable document with a macro that when
executed would drop a new version of PoetRAT written in Python.

STIBNITE continues to target entities in Azerbaijan and uses infrastructure overlapping with its previous
intrusions to make updates to PoetRAT. There does not appear to be motivation or active operations that
should be of concern to global ICS owners outside of Azerbaijan, although global operators can learn from
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of STIBNITE to enhance their defenses against adversaries
leveraging similar tactics. However, STIBNITE has demonstrated an explicit and calculated interest in
targeting Azerbaijani wind generation capabilities while it is still in its infancy. In addition, STIBNITE has
shown a repeated interest in targeting entities related to Azerbaijani renewable energy projects. It is likely
STIBNITE will gain initial access to these projects as they reach operational maturation by masquerading
as related and trusted entities, which STIBNITE has demonstrated in the past.
Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that Azerbaijani asset owners and
operators related to renewable energy interests should anticipate activities from
STIBNITE as more renewable asset projects reach commercial operation in the future.

WASSONITE
In late October 2019, Dragos identified the adversary WASSONITE targeting
the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) nuclear facility in India.
Subsequent intelligence research combined with public announcements
from KKNPP confirmed that adversaries had breached its IT network. In
addition, Dragos identified a pattern of activity associated with the same
tactics, tools, and techniques spanning multiple ICS entities that included
electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and space-centric
research sectors.

Dragos has determined that WASSONITE has operated since at least

Malware
as Kimsuky.2,3 The WASSONITE activity group leverages spear phishing
DTrack variant
as their initial infection vector. WASSONITE uses malware with
customization for specific internal networks in their targeting of ICS
verticals. WASSONITE’s geographic targeting has focused on Asian
entities, including India and possibly Japan and South Korea. WASSONITE
operations represent Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain intrusions. Intrusion activity consisted
of known malware leveraged in enterprise systems used for data theft and reconnaissance,
known credential harvesting tools, and use of Windows system tools for file transfer and lateral
movement.

On April 17, 2020, Dragos identified a variant of DTrack malware with technical overlaps to
previously observed samples associated with WASSONITE. This DTrack variant included specific
hardcoded ports and internal IP addresses targeting the Fujitsu Systemwalker distributed
computing and data center management software.
In July 2021, Dragos discovered multiple victims in the oil & gas, electric, and component
manufacturing industries communicating with a WASSONITE command and control server (C2)
server associated with the Appleseed backdoor. The Appleseed backdoor is a multi-component
backdoor that can take screenshots, log keystrokes, and collect removable media information and
specific victim files. It can also upload, download, and execute follow-on commands from the C2
server.4,5
While it is unknown if the Appleseed backdoor was deployed within an OT environment, the
screenshot functionality is valuable for use against the victim’s system operator or Human
Machine Interface (HMI) as a form of recon or data exfiltration to further understand the industrial
process.

Dragos assesses that WASSONITE will continue to target ICS entities in the electric
generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and space-centric research sectors with
their demonstrated intent and capabilities, with subsequent access sufficient in many cases to
execute follow-on attacks.

KAMACITE
Since 2014, the activity group KAMACITE has had a long-running and
consistent pattern of targeting critical infrastructure and industrial
verticals. KAMACITE has repeatedly targeted U.S. electric utilities, oil and
gas, and other industrial firms since as early as 2017 and has had additional
operations throughout Europe and North America. KAMACITE also has
extensive activity targeting the Ukraine electricity sector.
KAMACITE has technical overlaps with the group identified as Sandworm,
which multiple government and third-party entities have linked to the
Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the
Russian Federation, abbreviated as G.R.U. and commonly known as GRU.6
Many aspects of KAMACITE’s operations and tradecraft have remained
remarkably similar during the past six years. Dragos assesses that
KAMACITE serves as ELECTRUM’s access team, focusing on gaining
footholds in target networks. Although KAMACITE has not directly caused
an ICS disruptive event according to Dragos analysis, the group is responsible
for enabling other adversaries, such as ELECTRUM, to deliver ICS-specific
disruption with access operations.

Malware
BLACKENERGY 2/3,

Dragos has determined that KAMACITE has facilitated ICS-specific operations leveraging its
BLACKENERGY2 malware. BLACKENERGY malware first emerged in 2007 and subsequently
inspired or provided the foundation for three malware families: BLACKENERGY2, BLACKENERGY3,
and GREYENERGY. Of these, BLACKENERGY2 is one of a few malware samples to be publicly
identified with built-in ICS capability. Though BLACKENERGY2 had ICS capabilities it was
BLACKENERGY3 which served as the access tool to the IT networks that allowed the adversary to
pivot to OT networks and orchestrate the 2015 cyber attack on Ukraine’s electric system.
In 2021, Dragos uncovered two new GREYENERGY dropper variants in the wild: one in March of 2021,
and another in August 2021.
Dragos’s continual discovery of new GREYENERGY files in the wild demonstrates
that KAMACITE continues its development of GREYENERGY to further its operations.
KAMACITE may be using all GREYENERGY components in conjunction with other actions and tools
to facilitate more disruptive ICS attacks. ICS asset owners and defenders should view all components
of GREYENERGY as possible mechanisms with the ability to enable an ICS-focused attack.

KOSTOVITE uses dedicated operational relay
infrastructure against targets to obfuscate the origin of
its activities to obtain legitimate account credentials.
With this, KOSTOVITE then uses the stolen account
information to move laterally and gain access to the OT
environments. Once past the perimeter ingress,
KOSTOVITE used only what is referred to as the target’s
organic infrastructure, meaning no tools or code from
outside the target’s network, to move laterally across
target infrastructure.

.001

The Dragos investigation for KOSTOVITE’s target
showed that KOSTOVITE reached Stage 2 of ICS Kill
Chain capabilities with confirmed access into the OT
networks and devices. In early 2021, when KOSTOVITE
compromised the perimeter of the firm’s ICS/OT
network and devices, it exploited a vulnerability in their
remote access solution. This is consistent with
KOSTOVITE’s known tactics of also leveraging zero-day
vulnerabilities against VPN solutions including Ivanti
Connect Secure, formerly known as Pulse Secure.
KOSTOVITE is an adversary with significant tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTP) and technical overlaps
with the threat group known as UNC26307. UNC2630 is a
group with a history of access operations and data theft
and is associated with the use of 12 malware families
deployed exclusively on Ivanti VPN appliances.

Ransomware and Industrial Infrastructure
2021 was a pivotable year for ransomware gangs and their affiliates, with ransomware becoming
the number one cause for compromises in the industrial sector. Of all the industrial sectors in 2021,
ransomware groups targeted the manufacturing industry more than any other, nearly twice as
much as the other industrial groups combined.
THE UNINTENDED AND INTENDED RANSOMWARE THREATS TO OT
In many industrial sector compromises, weak boundaries between OT and IT, and poorly
understood interactions between these systems, coupled with the rise in remote access (as
more organizations rely on their work-from-home staff), have increased the overall risk. While
ransomware mainly targets enterprise IT systems, there are a number of instances when it does
impact OT directly and in integrated IT and OT environments.
Some ransomware adversaries indirectly impact OT when attacking enterprise IT. Once
adversaries achieve initial access, they can execute ransomware to gain a foothold in critical
enterprise IT systems and potentially move laterally into OT systems. After compromising an
organization, they demand ransoms that require victims to pay for the keys to decrypt their files.
Often targets have little recourse to restore functionality to their systems.
Conversely, some ransomware groups specifically target OT systems. EKANS is a specific ICStargeted ransomware that in 2020 targeted companies across electric, oil and gas, medical and
pharmaceutical manufacturing, and automotive sectors. Dragos analyzed multiple variants
of EKANS malware and discovered that the EKANS variant has the ability to stop ICS-related
Windows processes before initiating encryption.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY RANSOMWARE TRENDS
Analyzing industrial security trends during 2021,
Dragos compiled data on these ransomware sectors:
Manufacturing accounted for 65%, with Food & Beverage
coming in second (11%), and Transportation third (8%).
When analyzing manufacturing subsectors, Dragos
found that Metal Components (17%), Automotive (8%), and
Technology (6%) were the most common.
These are troubling trends when paired with the Dragos
services team finding that the manufacturing sector is
often the least mature in their OT security defenses.

RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS BY GROUP: CONTI AND LOCKBIT 2.0
Two ransomware groups, Conti and Lockbit 2.0, caused 51 percent of the total
ransomware attacks, with 70 percent of their malicious activity targeting
manufacturing. Conti dates to 2020, with recent confirmed attacks targeting CS
Energy and Shutterfly. In June of 2021, Lockbit 2.0 retooled and now focuses on
stealing data and extorting victims for financial gain by threatening publication
of exfiltrated data if victims do not pay the ransom. In 2021, Lockbit 2.0 claimed to
possess the data of energy equipment supplier Schneider Electric, according to a
post on Lockbit 2.0’s dark web forum. The compromise was never confirmed, and
the posted Schneider Electric data appears to have come from a previous attack on
Vestas, a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

26

WHY WERE RANSOMWARE GANGS SO SUCCESSFUL IN 2021?
This spike in ransomware attacks can be attributed to the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
phenomena. However, another key factor is the digital transformation of the industrial sectors and
the increased connectivity between IT and OT. Ransomware gangs like Conti and Lockbit 2.0 have
mobilized an underground marketplace where their developers outsource operations to affiliates
who execute the attacks. Affiliates do not require high-level technical expertise because the
ransomware software has been developed and they can purchase access to systems and hackers
for hire, which significantly lowers barriers to entry.
THE GROWING MATURITY OF RANSOMWARE AS A BUSINESS
With ransomware actors having fewer barriers to entry the financial impacts are becoming higher
for the industrial sectors. Typically, ransomware groups threaten to release exfiltrated corporate
and personal information before encrypting the target filesystems, then dump the information
on dark web leak sites. During the first half of 2021, the average remediation costs of ransomware
attacks against ICS sectors continued to rise from downtime, staffing, disruption to device and
network operations, lost business opportunities, and paid ransoms.
DarkSide (now rebranded as REvil) offered customer service with real-time chat support and
brought in at least $60 million before it announced it was closing its operations. Investing in
their business, ransomware gangs are funding research and development, which is fueling their
industry as their extortion methods become more extreme.
Ransomware trends are likely to continue shifting as groups reform, reprioritize, and law
enforcement pursues them and takes them offline. As groups disband and reform, there is a
blending of ransomware strains, and a greater likelihood that more strains with ICS/OT capabilities
will be developed in 2022.
LOOKING AHEAD INTO 2022
Dragos assesses with high confidence that ransomware will continue to disrupt
industrial operations and OT environments, whether through the integration
of OT kill processes into ransomware strains, the existence of flattened networks to prevent
ransomware from spreading into OT environments, or through operators shutting down OT
environments as a precaution while they attempt to stop IT ransomware from spreading to OT
systems.
Dragos assesses with low confidence that state-sponsored adversaries may leverage ransomware
to mask their alternate operations, for theft of intellectual property (including key OT schematic
details), for reconnaissance of target networks, and for other Stage 1 components of the ICS Cyber
Kill Chain.
Finally, Dragos assesses that ransomware actors’ extortion techniques will continue to grow
in severity and intensity as adversaries deploy any means available to pursue their ransom
payments.

Lessons Learned from Incident Response
A cybersecurity incident is a crisis for any organization. However, cyber
attacks targeting industrial organizations, including ransomware, have the
potential to disrupt operations and pose safety risks if not swiftly mitigated.
Incident response is rarely an inexpensive endeavor in terms of money, people,
operational disruption, or time.
The Dragos Incident Response team helps organizations prepare for, respond
to, and recover from cyber incidents in industrial environments. Our team of
experienced incident responders have consulted on numerous cases where
significant time and resources could have been saved with preparation. As an
example, many of the questions that organizations want answered are best
answered through network traffic analysis that cannot be obtained after the
attack if the environment was not configured to collect that data or tools used to
provide those insights had not been deployed prior to the incident. A key point is
that while preparation ahead of an incident is always core in IT or OT incident
response it is much more important in OT incident response because of the
unique nature of the environments and questions to be answered.
The following topics showcase some lessons learned from our field engagements
in 2021 that may help organizations avoid some of the most common issues
that increase the time, personnel, downtime, and expense of managing a
cybersecurity incident.

Lessons Learned from
the SolarWinds Compromise
In December 2020, the SolarWinds Orion breach
was reported. Initially, it was not clear how the
SolarWinds breach affected ICS/OT environments. It
is common knowledge that SolarWinds Orion is an
IT infrastructure monitoring platform. It was not well
understood, however, that several Managed Service
Providers (MSPs) also use the tool to monitor their
customer ICS/OT environments. Additionally, many
industrial OEMs embed the software as part of their
management offerings and some of the largest OEMs
use the tool to monitor service and maintenance
access. As a result, many ICS/OT environments were
compromised directly with the software installed in
their environments or indirectly through their thirdparty agreements despite not directly installing
SolarWinds in their own environment.
Both detection and documentation are crucial
to incident response. The sooner an incident is
detected, the sooner you can stop an adversary
from accomplishing their objectives–which often
includes severe financial damage to the target
organization. Documenting an incident improves
incident response workflows as well as the effective
remediation and lessons learned afterward. If
organizations do not properly document incidents
and findings, they cannot learn from these events
and will continue to make the same mistakes.

Beginning in January
2021, the Dragos
incident response
team responded to
several SolarWinds
compromise cases.

these cases the lessons
learned were consistent

The Value of Root Cause Analysis
In 2021, Dragos responded to a few incidents that resulted from malfunctioning
equipment or software, rather than adversaries. In each case, the impacted
organization made the right call by activating their incident response plans and
identifying possible root causes that may have impacted plant processes. These
engagements all proved the importance of analyzing the network traces caused
by malicious activities with awareness of the OT protocols used and the industrial
processes controlled by the systems investigated. The collaboration between internal
security and operations teams, external responders, and in some instances ICS
vendors is key to a successful root cause analysis (RCA).

Who Changed the Setpoints?
In one case, Dragos responded after an electric power transmission site observed
an unauthorized setpoint change that resulted in a limited impact on operations
and was quickly remediated. The command resembled a global test command run
annually, but there was no test at the time. Because the edge devices used at the
site are radio-controlled, it was feared that the unauthorized command might have
been sent via a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The organization did the right thing and
launched an official investigation of the incident and retained Dragos to help with
incident response and root cause analysis of the event.
The team of incident responders deployed the Dragos Platform to collect network
telemetry to monitor for potential, ongoing malicious activities. The incident
response team identified identical commands issued to the edge devices. As the
Dragos Platform captured the traffic, responders were able to identify the host
responsible for issuing the commands and proceeded to collect forensic data and
perform analysis. The team discovered that the command was issued by the actual
control software after the server rebooted. They contacted the OT vendor to help
investigate the root cause and the vendor found a programming error caused by an
edge-case configuration. Within two weeks from the point of contact, the vendor
had a fix for the software issue and deployed it to the customer environment
shortly thereafter.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

31

While this event was not a security breach, it highlights the value of network
security monitoring and root cause analysis beyond the cybersecurity use case.
A complex issue was detected and the root cause was determined in a matter of
days. However, if the monitoring had been in place at the affected site prior to the
incident, the resolution would have come more quickly.
This case also demonstrates the value of strong relationships with your most
important OEMs and third-party vendors. The positive relationship between the
client, the OEM of the affected equipment, and Dragos enabled the joint team to
quickly identify the root cause and identify and implement a solution.
NEED FOR MONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS
Had this been an actual cyber attack, the setpoint changes could have had more
devastating effects. Because of a lack of monitoring network traffic, the point of
origin from which the setpoints were changed would not have been identified and
would have to have been tediously hunted for using host forensic analysis. In most
cases, the collection of forensic artifacts from hosts in ICS environments is a manual
process that requires you to weigh the potential impact of this process against the
downtime of systems that control important physical processes.
Because the safety and reliability of ICS operations is the priority, forensic data
collection often takes place over an extended period of time. As a result, some
important data may be overwritten, which is another reason why continuous
network monitoring is so important in ICS operations. Monitoring that is aware of
the industrial protocols that are used in a specific environment allows defenders to
make sense of interactions of the IT layer and with the physical layer of operations,
such as the industrial process itself.

The Ghost in the Power Generator
In another case, Dragos was called in for an incident that was also deemed to be
operations related with no adversary involvement. One night, unexpectedly, the gaspowered turbines at a peak power generation site suddenly turned on and went into
idle. The SCADA operations had not issued the command for the site to go online. The
company appropriately activated its incident response retainer and Dragos personnel
immediately went to the site. Because no ICS network monitoring was in place at
the site, Dragos responders had to rely on logs and host data. Working with the local
operations crew, our response team conducted a walkthrough inspection of the site.
The determination was made that the commands to activate the control loop to start the
generator most likely came from the HMI housed in a small shed-like facility. There were
no remote connections, so the team considered direct action. However, security cameras
did not show anyone approaching the HMI or the shed. The Dragos incident response
team did identify moisture on the HMI and noticed it was a touch screen that was also
set to be abnormally bright.
Because of compliance and warranty concerns no non-native tools were allowed
to be used on the HMI. Therefore, the Dragos incident response team improvised by
deploying MS Paint on the system as it is a native and signed binary. The team left
the system running overnight and in the morning was able to identify large brushlike movements on the HMI. The responders were able to use MS Paint to confirm
that the moisture was causing “clicks” on the touchscreen HMI that resulted in
kicking off the control loop while the generator was down for maintenance.
Had ICS network monitoring been in place at the site, malicious activity could have
been ruled out as a root cause much faster by confirming or ruling out any remote
access to the HMI, potentially enabling the local operations team to identify the
actual cause without having to call in external responders. Further, the commands
from the HMI would have been immediately observed by the operations staff leading
to less lost time and quicker root cause analysis on an operations issue.
This case also shows the importance of being on site during ICS incident response
to accurately assess the environment and understand the situation. This awareness,
combined with experience and out-of-the-box thinking, can lead to the quick resolution
of a case versus relying only on logs and forensic data.

Never Let an Incident Response Team’s
First ICS Be Your ICS!
An electric operator contacted Dragos to conduct an incident
analysis after they experienced a ransomware attack on a control
center for renewable energy. Dragos was the second team retained
to respond to the case, after the first analysis left many questions
unanswered.
The adversary leveraged an internet-connected SCADA server
listed on Shodan.io, harvested credentials on this system, and
then moved laterally through the environment. Because of
a weak security posture and no network segmentation, the
adversary gained access to the domain controller and other key
systems at the plant. After manually exploring the environment
and manipulating some systems to facilitate data infiltration
and exfiltration, the adversaries went silent. A week later, the
adversary executed the ransomware attack where they deployed
scripts and tools to weaken the company’s defenses, such as
Microsoft Defender, and deployed ransomware through the Group
Policy, WinRM, and PSExec-as-a-service to most systems on
the network. The adversary also performed some anti-forensics
measures by clearing the Windows event logs and disabling
further logging. While they took their time initially exploring and
mapping out the environment, the actual attack of manipulating
its defenses to deploying and executing the malware happened in
about an hour.
The organization immediately realized something was wrong
when applications failed and computer systems stopped
responding. They quickly called in an incident response
provider who did not have experience in ICS incident response.
The provider ran antivirus programs on the affected systems,
which deleted data that would have facilitated root cause
analysis and did not result in recovering any data encrypted
by the ransomware. They additionally spent time performing
vulnerability scans across the environment which can be
extremely risky in ICS/OT networks.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

In this and similar
engagements, the key
takeaways are:
Ensure you have
separate Incident
Response Plans (IRPs) in place for
IT and ICS/OT.
Set up incident
response retainers
as part of your IRPs.
Engaging outside help during an
incident could cause you to select
inadequate support when you
need it fast.
When interacting
with an OT
environment,
comprehensive knowledge of
industrial control systems is a
must. For example, pausing or
even fully stopping or removing
computer systems from an
OT environment could impact
the safety and reliability of the
operations.
Do not run
antivirus programs
on industrial
control systems to “remove” a
malware infection. The antivirus
malware deletion attempts
result in incomplete removal
of the malware and files for
essential OT operations could
be deleted. Systems must be in
a verifiable good state for safe,
reliable operation of the ICS.
Compromised computer systems
in an ICS/OT environment should
always be rebuilt from known
good backups or golden images.

In April 2021, Dragos identified the compromise of an industrial Managed Service
Provider (MSP) and OT software vendor based in South Asia with a worldwide customer
base. The MSP was compromised by multiple persistent Shadowpad malware infections
on multiple internet egress points used by the MSP. The Shadowpad malware C2 was
associated with an adversary that had infrastructure overlaps with a threat group
tracked by another company labeled as RedEcho.11
Dragos observed in internet telemetry that this MSP had ongoing VPN tunnels with
multiple prominent electric and water utility customers in the United Kingdom. Dragos
confirmed that the VPN connections were legitimate tunnels used by the South Asian
MSP to provide contracted service for their utility customers. These VPN connections
were temporally correlated with, and using the same network egress points, as the
Shadowpad malware C2 traffic.
While Dragos could not confirm that the adversary had direct access to the MSP’s UK-based
electric and water utility customer networks through the VPN tunnels, the C2 malware
activity on the same MSP networks as the VPN connections to the MSP utility customers
clearly represented increased risk to UK critical infrastructure. Dragos notified the MSP
and the affected MSP customers via the national CERTs. Initially the MSP downplayed the
compromise, stating it was likely incidental malware that already had been removed.
After more discussion where the Dragos Intel team explained that the indicators and
behaviors identified matched those of an ongoing threat group, the MSP contacted Dragos to
share they hired an incident response provider to perform analysis and mitigation. During
the conversation, Dragos learned that the incident response was limited to identifying
the systems actively communicating with the adversary’s C2 infrastructure and the
remediation efforts focused on removing malware with antivirus software. Unsurprisingly,
more Shadowpad C2 communication from the MSP reappeared just a few weeks later.

35

In the third quarter of 2021, Dragos observed the MSP shut down three of its
broadband network connections affected by the Shadowpad malware, representing
some 762 static internet IP addresses directly allocated to the MSP. The MSP
moved services including the website and one of three previous firewalls to a
different network with only a few dynamic IP addresses. Dragos assesses with low
confidence that the network abandonment and migration by the MSP is related to
the MSP discovering or understanding the extent of compromise.

Key Takeaways
When performing incident response, following a proper process is important. Whether you are relying on
an external incident response provider or have an internal team, always ensure they:
• Determine the root cause of the intrusion into the OT environment.
• Develop a recommended course of action for the OT operations team to contain,
mitigate, and eradicate.
• During all steps, ensuring the OT environment remains in a safe and reliable state is
imperative. Running antivirus software on OT computer systems with the intent to remove
malware neither helps to effectively analyze a threat nor reliably removes it.
At best, this approach will remove malware partially from a system and will delete valuable
forensic data while inspiring a false sense of security. The impacted network must be swept for
additional compromised systems and any affected system should be rebuilt from clean backups or
a golden image.
As an MSP, it is important to monitor all ingress and egress points on the network and monitor internal
network traffic for unusual lateral movement. By now it is an established fact that adversaries will target
MSPs to leverage trusted access to the adversary’s advantage. Monitoring for any unusual activities
is an important security measure to keep customers safe. Any access that can be switched to multifactor authentication (MFA) should be addressed. Considering the operational constraints of an MSP,
MFA might be difficult to implement at best and impossible at worst. As it is one of the most effective
defensive controls, implementing MFA at least on all MSP-owned systems should be considered.
As an MSP customer, you should monitor all network segments and systems accessed by an MSP for
any unusual activity such as administrative access outside of maintenance windows or access to systems
that are not managed by the MSP. Dragos realizes this is easier said than done. At minimum, perform risk
assessment when considering tasking to an MSP and establish that OT security monitoring is an effective
method to minimize risk that needs to be factored into the business case.

The Complexity of Remote Access
in OT Environments
OT Watch is an optional subscription to the Dragos Platform that
enables our global hunt team to find unknown threats from our
customers ICS/OT environments, gain additional visibility and
insights, and provide guidance on vulnerability management.

When the attack on the Oldsmar water treatment facility went public, the Dragos OT Watch team
began a series of threat hunts looking for other unauthorized access from legitimate remote access
solutions. Over the course of the threat hunt, the OT Watch team documented the following remote
access solutions to shed light on what remote access looks like in OT and how that can cause a
breach similar to Oldsmar and why remote access continues to be a security risk.

We have classified remote access
into the following two categories:
OEM AND VENDOR
REMOTE ACCESS SOLUTIONS:
Remote access solutions are a key component
of modern OT equipment solutions, particularly
during the pandemic when most organizations
had to quickly shift to a remote workforce.
Both standardized reference architectures and
consistent remote access provide equipment to
vendors and ensure the equipment functions as
designed. Remote access solutions help provide
timely resolution of problems system users may
encounter and can increase the value of an asset
owner’s investment.
However, when implementing these types
of solutions it is critical that the asset owners
understand how each remote access method is
used and consider the security posture of the
asset that is being accessed.
USE CASE: First- and third-party connections
are used for operations (dispatch, control, etc.),
security services (monitoring, patching, antivirus,
and other updates), and maintenance and
diagnostics. These may be interactive access, are
often persistent, and could be both.
RISK: The main risk is the potential for supply
chain attacks that impact a considerable number
of a vendor’s customers where the service itself
becomes the attack vector.

FACILITY DEPLOYED
REMOTE ACCESS SOFTWARE
Another class of remote access solutions are oneoff solutions such as Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP), TeamViewer, VNC (Virtual Network
Computing), or PCAnywhere which are enabled
or installed by the facilities—often with little to
no oversight. Frequently this stems from groups
of stakeholders working on different projects or
acquiring new process assets through mergers,
acquisitions, or other business consolidation
events.
USE CASE: Allows both vendor and asset owner
access while onsite or offsite. Often a remote
access software solution like PCAnywhere is
used as an onsite tool to remotely connect to
systems in different buildings or rooms at the
same location.
RISK: Misconfiguration can change an ‘onsite’
remote access tool to become a rogue remote
access tool. Lack of oversight or documentation
leads to end-of-life software, vulnerabilities, and
unknown access methods.
STRATEGY: Monitor your east/west network
traffic in addition to your north/south network
traffic and be sure to enforce a remote access
strategy, focused on chokepoints where possible,
that enables staff to work safely.

STRATEGY: Trust, but verify. Monitor and log all
remote connections and have isolation playbooks
as a component to your incident response plans.
The critical take-away in our analysis of remote access solutions is to know what
methods are in use and by whom, and to routinely audit and review your access logs
for any irregularities. You should pay particular attention to remote access methods that do not have
specific use cases or are overly broad. Often, remote access to the OT environments is persistent and
there is no baseline understanding for what is and is not “normal vendor access.”

REMOTE ACCESS INTO OT ENVIRONMENTS
Many customers believe their OT networks are accessible only from their enterprise IT
environments, or they are completely separated. The data tells a different story.
The following diagram shows a complicated architecture where multiple network segments have
remote access to multiple network segments. Notably, the majority of remote access is not from the
“Internet to OT” connection, but the connections between internal OT to OT systems. That said, a
wide variety of sources and destinations exist between “IT to OT” and “OT to IT” connections.
The flows depicted in green are common and expected while the flows highlighted in
pink are more interesting and need additional monitoring and auditing to ensure they
are not being used improperly.

DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS FROM THE FIELD
The physical consequences and impacts of a cyber attack on OT systems are
exacerbated by the complex interdependencies between IT, OEM, and the cloud
connections that are deeply entwined within operations environments. The Dragos
team has been rank-stacking and comparing our findings year over year since 2017.
Our key take-away: Dragos’s new customers in 2021 had the same issues that our
new customers had in 2020, who also had the same challenges as customers in the
previous years. In some ways, this is good because it enforces that we understand
what the top challenges are for the industrial community.

During 2021, Dragos
uncovered that 86% of

Visibility is more than asset inventory. When customers only monitor
the IT to OT boundary without monitoring the activity inside the ICS
network, Dragos considers this limited visibility. Frequently, defenders
are blind to critical network traffic when they do not capture the OT
communication flows, or they capture these flows but do not utilize ICS
protocol dissection. Full visibility is achieved when network and device
logs are centralized and can correlate various segments with network
traffic analysis and asset inventories.
Defenders can see the full picture of what is occurring across their
industrial assets and sites only with full visibility. Full visibility
facilitates the identification of threats. Threat detection can come in
many forms, but its major purpose is to emphasize behaviors that the
human defender should be aware of such as ransomware, control
manipulation, and safety manipulation. Threat intelligence provides
the necessary context for threat detections so defenders can make
the best defensive decisions. Early detections, with the appropriate
context, enable defenders to rapidly execute response playbooks, which
expedite response, containment, and remediation efforts.

In 2021, 77% of Dragos
services engagements

(which is a slight
decrease from 2020).

CHANGE

-11

For the last two decades, OT asset owners have concentrated their
cybersecurity posture on prevention. Specifically, they rely on
segmentation, firewalls, and DMZs to isolate their operational networks
from the internet, corporate networks, and vendors. Yet, poor security
perimeters continue to be a major problem for most OT asset owners.
Dragos considered findings to be related to poor security perimeters if
they involved issues such as porous firewall rules, network boundary
bypasses, or flat networks. This includes instances where the only
segmentation is the initial firewall between the IT-OT boundary and
when there are unnecessary communication pathways to critical
assets within the network. While it is unlikely that an adversary could
cause an operational impact with access only to the corporate network,
poor perimeters between IT and OT often allow adversaries to pivot
from the corporate network to operational networks, where they can
cause ICS impacts. However, an OT interdependency on an IT asset,
such as a billing system that also performs scheduling or product
tracking, is one example of how an adversary could impact operations
from the corporate network.
Every OT asset owner needs a defensible architecture. A network
with weak borders, especially when combined with a lack of visibility,
is nearly impossible to defend from even a moderately motivated
adversary.

A major theme in the 2019 Year In Review report was the disconnect
between expectations and reality on fully segmented and air-gapped
systems. During 2020, there was a significant improvement in isolated
ICS environments (with a two-thirds drop in external routable network
connections). In 2021, external connections to OT spiked upwards, more
than doubling to 70%. Dragos assesses that this increase is due to the
high demand for remote access in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many OT environments appear fully segmented on paper, yet when
validated with the Dragos Platform analysis the Dragos team finds
that the environments often have many connections and are not as
segmented as originally believed. These environments may have
been initially designed and implemented as segmented, but over time
firewall exceptions and persistent vendor connections steadily bridged
the gap between IT and OT.
The most effective security control for reducing the cyber risks
associated with remote access is multi-factor authentication (MFA).
However, MFA cannot be implemented everywhere or in every
situation. Dragos recommends that vendor connections are enabled
upon request and then monitored to ensure they are used only when
authorized. And the ability to rapidly disconnect external connections
is essential for effective incident response.

For example, an organization may leverage the same credential
management on the IT network as it does on the Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ) and ICS network. This is yet another configuration that can lead
to a weakening of perimeters and may enable an adversary to easily
traverse to ICS assets using the credentials it obtained from IT accounts.
There is no question that reusing credentials may feel more efficient to
the endpoint administrators maintaining your operating environments.
However, frequently, this technique can allow an adversary to move
laterally across your operating environment. And, it may not raise
any alarms if the activity is not recognized as “new” in your operating
environment and lead to a security incident going unnoticed.

Cybersecurity Assessments Findings
In 2021, Dragos performed ICS cybersecurity assessments across nearly every OT
vertical. The data from these engagements enables Dragos to provide key insights on
the OT industry as well as provide specific findings for individual sectors. Dragos uses
a consequence-driven approach called the Crown Jewel Analysis (CJA) Model when
scoping and conducting these assessments. This approach helps bind the scope of
assessments while keeping the adversary mindset.
THE CROWN JEWEL ANALYSIS (CJA) MODEL
The Crown Jewel Analysis (CJA) Model is a repeatable scoping approach that helps
visualize how an attacker assesses a system to achieve a specific consequence.
CJA is visualized using a reverse pyramid. For each layer, the elements contributing
the most to functional output (primary purpose); functional dependencies (reliance on
other systems to fulfill functional output); and level of exposure must be analyzed and
understood before progressing to a lower layer. Adversaries and activity groups utilize a
similar process when identifying Crown Jewels to further their attack chain.

SYSTEM OWNER

Specific provider within an industry discipline, geographic region or demographic that
may be targeted

CRITICAL SYSTEM OR SUBSYSTEM

Collection of assets, facilities, networks and/or operators that provide a specific, collective
function and output (these determine your starting position within the organization)

CRITICAL FUNCTION
OR SUB-FUNCTION

Required principal tasks of a system, such as heating, cooling, exchanging, pumping,
separating, compressing, distributing, storing, etc.

CRITICAL COMPONENTS

Physical asset required to complete a system critical function (e.g. pumps, valves, motors,
piping, suction screens, inlets, etc.

CONTROLLERS

Represented by their direct interconnection between the cyber or logical realm and
the physical realm. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Remote Terminal Units
(RTUs) fall under this category

CROWN
JEWELS

Critical data, logical assets, communication paths and/or control interfaces required to
exercise control over components, and thus functions (including HMIs, engineering and
operator workstations, gateways, controllers, etc.)

Using CJA and credible threat intelligence, Dragos analyzes plausible attack pathways to
Crown Jewels in a bid to educate asset owners and operators on the potential exposure
to adversaries and activity groups and to better prioritize the findings and
recommendations in the reports. The scenarios illustrate realistic ways that an
adversary could achieve a desired impact to the process or facility, specific to that
facility’s physical equipment implementation and security posture.

A TTX is a training and planning readiness event
that uses a threat emulation scenario to challenge
and evaluate a client’s existing response plans,
practices, and capabilities. They include collaboration
between all stakeholders, including IT and OT security
teams and operations leaders to strengthen internal
communication strategies and develop relationships.
TTXs are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of
the client’s cybersecurity incident response plans, the
coordination of the plans with partners, capability and
resource employment, communication flow, and the
actions taken upon plan activation.
A Dragos TTX demonstrates how a realistic attack may
occur within a unique ICS environment based on the
organization’s most concerning risks. Dragos passively
researches and analyzes perceived cybersecurity risks
within the outward-facing network infrastructure. Any
risk that would allow the development of unauthorized
access to key OT assets is added to the exercise
scenario. Unique environmental information such as
asset types, vendors, personnel, partnerships, network
architecture, and models have been coupled with
specific threat behavior, real-world historical events,
and activity groups to generate a theoretical exercise

Vulnerabilities
2021 was a challenging year for ICS and OT vulnerabilities. There were
nearly double the published ICS and OT vulnerabilities in 2021 than 2020.
This year highlighted vulnerabilities range from the remote, persistent,
and nearly ubiquitous risks like Log4j, the Windows zero-day vulnerability
PrintNightmare, and industrial hardware rootkit-level vulnerabilities that
allow attackers to compromise exposed devices. These vulnerabilities
underscore the fast-growing universe of persistent threats that exist
across all layers of the Purdue Model. These vulnerabilities also highlight
the complex nature of connected and networked components in OT
environments and in ICS.
There continues to be a trend where the guidance in vulnerabilities is lacking
in context and details for operators to make risk-based decisions. Dragos

have sufficient mitigation advice in 2021.

Apache Log4j Vulnerability
WHAT IS IT?
Before the Alibaba Cloud Security team disclosed the Log4j vulnerability to Apache
in November of 2021, few people anticipated that a Java logging library could have
such negative far-reaching security impacts. The Log4j vulnerability (CVE-202144228) allows for remote code execution and access to servers and hardware that
use Java and that the Log4j framework can be exploited to take complete control of
a system.
Log4j is a frequently used logging solution that allows developers to monitor the
execution of their Java applications for errors and exceptions. Utilizing Log4j
was considered a best practice and is a commonly used design pattern within
enterprise Java development.
WHY ARE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS VULNERABLE TO LOG4J?
The exploitation of Log4j involves sending a specially designed request to the
target system. The request generates a log using Log4j and leverages the Java
Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup feature to perform a request to an
attacker-controlled server from where a malicious payload can be fetched and
executed. Industrial networks are among the systems that are vulnerable to the
Log4j Java logging library.
Dragos has observed both the attempted and successful exploitation of the Log4j
vulnerability in the wild. Based on these observations, on December 8, 2021, Dragos
coordinated a takedown of malicious domains used during the early exploitation
attempts. Dragos has also observed other intelligence organizations reporting
cyber criminals launching Log4j attacks to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons, malware,
cryptocurrency miners, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and other malicious programs.
Because Log4j has been a ubiquitous logging solution for Enterprise Java
development for decades, the vulnerability has the potential to persist within the
software and hardware of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) environments for years
to come. Log4j is found in open-source repositories used in numerous industrial
applications, such as Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC)
Foundation’s Unified Architecture (UA) Java Legacy. Adversaries also can leverage
Log4j in proprietary Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy
Management Systems (EMS), which use Java in their codebase.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

51

NEXT STEPS TO MITIGATE LOG4J
Major OT vendors have been disclosing the vulnerability’s impact on their software
and equipment. Dragos assesses additional disclosures will continue as more
vendors identify the use of Log4j across ICS product lines. Unfortunately, the nature
of the Log4j vulnerability makes it challenging to identify. Because of this, Dragos
assesses that Log4j will be a persistent vulnerability in ICS environments for years
to come.
OT networks that incorporate robust segmentation in their environments reduce
the risks from this vulnerability, but should be patched during the next turnaround
or operational shutdown. For ICS environments that lack segmentation or allow
direct internet access to ICS assets such as JAVA-based SCADA / HMI products /
hardware devices, Dragos recommends that organizations patch immediately and
strongly consider disabling internet access to all affected ICS/OT assets.

Windows Zero-Day
Vulnerability:
PrintNightmare
WHAT IS IT?
On June 29, 2021, security researchers at Sangfor Technologies accidentally
disclosed a Windows zero-day vulnerability nicknamed PrintNightmare in a
how-to-exploit guide published on a public GitHub repository. PrintNightmare is a
critical security vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Windows operating system.
The vulnerability occurs within the print spooler service and allows a remoteauthenticated adversary to execute malicious code at SYSTEM-level privileges.
This enables an adversary to create new users with full user rights, install
malicious software, and modify or delete data.

HOW ADVERSARIES GAIN ACCESS TO OT NETWORKS WITH PRINTNIGHTMARE
Adversaries can leverage PrintNightmare CVE-2021-34527, CVE-2021-34481, and
CVE-2021-36958 vulnerabilities to gain access to OT networks from IT networks
through OT DMZ remote access workstations or “jump boxes” if they are left
unpatched. Also, these vulnerabilities make an OT network’s unpatched Windows
assets susceptible to lateral movement and privilege escalation.
| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

52

The PrintNightmare vulnerability was first discovered in March 2021. Sangfor, a
network security and cloud computing solutions company, planned to share its
research at Black Hat that year. However, the proof-of-concept (POC) was released due
to confusion over another Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675, released on June
8, 2021). The researchers assumed the remote code execution (RCE) proof-of-concept
was the same method to exploit Windows Print Spooler CVE-2021-1675 and thus was
the same vulnerability. Because CVE-2021-1675 had already been patched, they saw no
harm in releasing details earlier than planned.
The exploitation of the PrintNightmare vulnerability can enable the compromise of a
desktop or server running the Print Spooler service and allows an adversary to obtain
SYSTEM-level privileges. On July 6, 2021, Microsoft began releasing unscheduled or
out-of-band patches to address the vulnerability, which resulted in some printers no
longer functioning – where after patching, only administrators could install printer
drivers to a Windows print server.
A third vulnerability was discovered on July 15, 2021, impacting the Windows Print
Spooler Service (CVE-2021-34481) that could also allow an adversary to perform remote
code execution at SYSTEM-level privileges. Microsoft addressed this third vulnerability
on August 10, 2021, with an out-of-band patch. A fourth vulnerability (CVE-2021-36958)
was then discovered on August 11, 2021, affecting the Windows Print Spooler Service
again with remote code execution (RCE) at SYSTEM-level privileges if exploited. This
fourth vulnerability was patched on September 14, 2021, during the September 2021
Microsoft Patch Tuesday security updates.

WHAT IS THE RISK OF PRINTNIGHTMARE TO OT ENVIRONMENTS?
Dragos has not observed any adversaries leveraging the PrintNightmare
vulnerability in OT network compromises. However, Dragos penetration
testers have successfully leveraged PrintNightmare to help clients enhance
their detections for it. For example, detections and preventions were in place
for blocking the binary and PowerShell script variants of the exploit in some
environments. Dragos demonstrated capabilities by executing the PowerShell
variant of PrintNightmare in memory and by leveraging PowerShell ISE to bypass
the prevention and detection mechanisms.
The vulnerabilities in the Print Spooler Service enable escalation of privileges
and freedom of movement within the OT network’s Windows assets. Windows
assets in an OT environment can serve many functions such as engineering
and remote access workstations, HMIs, historians, and multiple types of servers
providing basic networking and domain functions. Leaving these assets unpatched
allows even low-sophistication adversaries to have more options and methods for
compromising network assets.

PLC and Industrial Hardware
Rootkit-Level Vulnerabilities
THE LONG-TERM RISKS OF PERSISTENT ROOTKITS
Existing vulnerabilities in industrial equipment often allow threat groups to install
persistent rootkits when there are insufficient hardware protections in the equipment’s
original design. Most modern industrial hardware lacks the functionality needed
to securely boot the device, and often both modern and legacy hardware remain in
service for decades. This results in a class of vulnerabilities that do not disappear as
long as the hardware remains in service.
Rootkit-style vulnerabilities in the industrial space are not new. Specific research
examples go back more than a decade to 2009.13 Due to a rush to fix long-standing
insecurities in industrial products combined with existing industrial protocols, this
class or chain of vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Frequently
vendors add encryption features to the industrial protocols, while leaving the
underlying insecurity exposed. On the surface this strategy looks good to end users
because traffic is no longer in plain text, but this does not add much, if any, complexity
to the path to compromise that the adversary must follow or the defenses he must
surmount or circumvent.
As a result, it is more challenging to analyze traffic on the wire to determine if a device
is being compromised. For example, an attacker may need to circumvent a trusted
relationship between the engineering workstation and the PLC. Once that trusted
relationship is exploited, the controller may be permanently infected. Worse, if the
traffic is encrypted, it may be tough to determine that the infection took place.
There are many examples of firmware rootkits in the wild and many devices have a
series of vulnerabilities that can be used together to install rootkits.

WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF ROOTKIT VULNERABILITIES?
In 2021, Iranian researchers reported14 a rootkit they discovered in a server’s integrated
Lights Out peripheral (iLO) boards. The rootkit allowed the adversary to maintain
access to the individual board on the server hardware. From this point, the adversary
issued low-level commands to the computer hardware, including the ability to wipe
the server remotely and potentially install new software along with or in place of the
standard computer operating system.
In 2021, Siemens disclosed a vulnerability in its PLC, CVE-2020-15782,15 which can
allow an attacker to load malicious logic files into the PLC. This malicious logic can
circumvent memory protections in the PLC and may overwrite core PLC functions
with a rootkit. Dragos discovered similar problems with other PLC logic runtimes in
prior years. In 2019, Dragos demonstrated use of a ladder logic payload for developing
a rootkit in Phoenix Contact’s logic runtime, which is used by dozens of PLC vendors.16
Earlier research covered rootkits in another ladder logic runtime by 3S-Software.17
Triconex SIS was the victim of such an attack, which used CVE-2018-8872 and CVE2018-752218 to install additional functionality in the firmware. Dragos continued to
research the device and identified several other rootkit-style vulnerabilities19 in the
Triconex line, particularly in the network interface cards of the controller which could
be used for a similar purpose as the HP iLO rootkit.
Dragos has researched a number of industrial embedded products including
Emerson’s WirelessHART Gateway products,20 Tofino Xenon industrial hardware,21
Lilee Systems train communications gateways22 and GE MDS radio equipment.23
Vendors have been responsive to the issues reported. However, the designs of these
products mean that they can rarely be secured from the risk of rootkit installation.
Instead, Dragos advisories highlight which services allow for the potential
installation of a rootkit so that end users may restrict access to and monitor those
services for suspicious activity.

MITIGATING THE RISKS OF ROOTKIT VULNERABILITIES
Developing a full-fledged rootkit is not a simple task. Finding and chaining
the vulnerabilities together to allow firmware modification requires significant
research. Once installed, a rootkit may allow for intentional or unintentional
damage to the equipment. For example, a rootkit that does not properly sanitize or
bounds-check future attacker inputs can cause misoperation.
Dragos assesses that this was the case with the TRISIS rootkit, where after
installation the rootkit allowed for direct memory tampering. Dragos assesses
that an error in the memory tampering caused the safety system to trip the plant,
causing the discovery of the implant. This example highlights the need for the
attacker to test their rootkit on numerous revisions of the target system under
various configurations. Rootkits should not be considered the most likely problem.
However, vulnerabilities that present persistent access to embedded systems can
become a problem. The compromise of these devices can be challenging to detect
and root out of a network.
The best steps to mitigate the risks associated with rootkits include:
• Ask the vendor to implement the NULL CIPHER when adding security to
their protocols. This allows devices and users to mutually authenticate while
leaving the network traffic visible to inspection.
• Monitor embedded devices for unusual network traffic. For example, a VPN
appliance or PLC establishing or attempting to establish outbound network
connections is a cause for concern.
• Check all downloads with the vendor code signature to ensure it is legitimate
and unmodified software.
• Minimize network exposure of embedded products and monitor the network
traffic to and from such products. Remember that embedded devices are
complicated to analyze forensically because network traffic flows are often the
only practical way to analyze these devices without sending them back to the
factory.
Keeping these longstanding issues in mind when mitigating new device vulnerabilities is essential. It is crucial to be aware of rootkit vulnerabilities when exposing
devices. Even if a device “has all the patches applied,” it could still be susceptible to
vulnerability chaining or even abuse of features which could allow an attacker to
install a rootkit and compromise your system.

BY THE NUMBERS

Key ICS Vulnerability Trends
In 2021, the number of reported ICS vulnerabilities
continued to increase, which coincided with an
increase in vendors providing patches for disclosed
flaws in advisories. Dragos researchers analyzed
1703 ICS/OT common vulnerabilities and exposures
(CVE) during 2021, which is more than twice as last
year. For each CVE, Dragos independently assesses,
confirms, and often corrects the advisories and
describes any flaws in firmware or software.
Of the advisories that Dragos individually reviewed
in 2021, 38 percent contained errors in the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score associated
with the CVE. Asset owners should take this into
account when making patching and mitigation
decisions for their networks.

This includes engineering
workstations, PLCs, sensors,
and industrial controllers.

At the lower levels, adversaries would need access to a control
system network to exploit these vulnerabilities, making them more
difficult to exploit. Implementing proper network segmentation can
help mitigate these vulnerabilities, especially when combined with
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for remote sessions.

Loss of View, Loss of Control, or Both
Loss of control and loss of view are among the worst operations scenarios in an ICS environment.
In these conditions data continues to flow and the systems continue to operate, but they are no
longer operating as designed and the operator is typically unaware of the issue. In 2021, 35 percent
of the advisories that Dragos analyzed could cause both a loss of view and loss of control in an OT
system. The percentage is much smaller when looking at loss of one or the other, as shown below.

Many Advisories Lack Actionable Guidance
In 2021, 24 percent of advisories had no patch
when announced, while 76 percent had a
patch. Frequently, vendors do not provide
advice to asset owners and operators if they
are unable to patch the identified vulnerability.
Of the advisories that Dragos tracked in 2021
that did not initially have a patch, 19 percent
had no mitigation. Sixty-four percent of those
advisories that had a patch had no mitigation.
When a patch is unavailable from a vendor or
industrial organizations find that patching isn’t
feasible or is too expensive from an operational
standpoint, they look for alternative mitigation
as a substitute. In 2021, Dragos found that 96
percent of the patches that they analyzed had
no alternate mitigation.

vulnerabilities beyond what is included

of advisories that did not include this
information.

Correcting Vulnerability Severity Ratings
In addition to the lack of actionable information
for most ICS-related vulnerability advisories, many
advisories and individual vulnerabilities contained
errors that could inadvertently mislead practitioners
who use CVSS scores to triage for mitigation or
patching. These errors could cause asset owners and
operators to dedicate more resources to fixing the
vulnerabilities that represent a lower level of risk and
severity over those that might represent a higher level
of risk for their own ICS environments.
CVEs are scored using the InformaCVSS, which is a free
and open industry standard for assessing the severity of
computer system security vulnerabilities. The National
Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) launched the
CVSS scoring system in February 2005, with the goal
of providing “open and universally standard severity
ratings of software vulnerabilities.” CVSS scores are
calculated for each CVE based on a formula that depends
on several metrics that approximate ease-of-exploit and
the impact of exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with
10 being the most severe. CVSS was designed with IT
systems in mind, but it can be somewhat helpful in ICS/
OT environments as well.
Dragos provides corrected CVSS scores based on how
an adversary could leverage a vulnerability in ICS
environments in its WorldView threat intelligence
reports. The corrected information allows practitioners
to prioritize the CVEs that carry the most risk for their
own environments and to focus their resources on the
most severe issues first. However, CVSS scores can
be misleading and often do not accurately capture all
of the risk of a particular vulnerability. ICS security
professionals should not use them as the sole factor in
prioritizing vulnerabilities.
In 2021, Dragos gave a higher score to 52% of CVEs relating
to ICS/OT networks than what these CVEs had received at
publication. Forty-five percent of the severities that Dragos
analyzed had a lower severity score than at publication,
and three percent stayed the same.

Dragos works with the community to help vendors provide more
accurate, actionable, and easier-to-track advisories. In 2021, we
significantly enhanced the vulnerability management features offered
to customers through the Dragos Platform.
Dragos assesses vulnerabilities in our WorldView Intelligence reports
and in the Dragos Platform and categorizes them by threat levels:
“Immediate Action,” “Limited Threat,” “Possible Threat,” “No Action,
and “Hype.” Dragos also recommends four different responses to
those threats. Immediate action vulnerabilities require just that,
consideration within the environment and a priority for remediation.
These are network exploitable vulnerabilities that may have been
actively exploited in the wild or for which a public exploit is available
online. These flaws have a higher risk of impacting ICS networks and
generally apply to devices that can affect the industrial control process.
In 2021, four percent of vulnerabilities were in the “Remediate” category.
About half of the vulnerabilities fall into the “Limited Threat” category.
Dragos recommends defenders resolve these vulnerabilities through
proper network hygiene, segmentation, and network monitoring. A
common recommendation is to limit the potential communication
paths so that assets that need to communicate with each other are
the only assets that can communicate with each other over routable
protocols. This enables ICS security professionals to funnel ICS/OT risks
into focal points that they can monitor for threats so they can get their
teams back to intelligence-based decision making.

In the past year, Dragos found that the Dragos Platform could provide additional recommended
actions on top of the Now, Next, Never categories used in previous years. The focus is to highlight
the specific actions customers should take based on the risk level of the assessed vulnerabilities.
So, instead of discussing “Now, Next, Never” prioritization, Dragos now provides the recommended
actions: Remediate, Mitigate, Monitor, and Ignore.
Possible risks are often local threats which can coincide with adversaries living off the land. Dragos
recommends that ICS security professionals monitor these vulnerabilities for malicious activity. In 2021,
87 percent of the vulnerabilities that Dragos analyzed were in the “Mitigate” and “Monitor” categories.
Vulnerabilities in the “Ignore” category do not increase the level of risk to the process at all. The effort
it takes to mitigate these vulnerabilities is generally not a good use of the ICS security professional’s
time because adversaries are not as likely to exploit them. Only 9% of the vulnerabilities that Dragos
reviewed were in this category.

Mitigating Vulnerabilities in 2022
With security concerns growing and controls mandated in some industries, the benefits from the
level of effort spent on one security control over another are not always clear. In the realm of ICS/
OT vulnerabilities, it is important to focus and prioritize threats accurately and have clear actionable
mitigations that reduce the amount of downtime, while still protecting people and processes.
PUBLISHED VENDOR AND PUBLIC CERT ADVISORIES ALONE OFTEN DO NOT
PROVIDE ENOUGH DETAILS TO MITIGATE THE INHERENT RISKS AND BRIDGE
THE GAPS UNTIL IT IS TIME TO APPLY A PATCH.
While it is a positive action when a firmware or software patch is released with an
advisory, end users in industrial environments may still hesitate to apply the patch.
PATCHES ARE OFTEN SYNONYMOUS WITH DOWNTIME AND THERE ARE
MANY DOCUMENTED CASES WHERE THE ACT OF PATCHING HAS CAUSED
ISSUES OR PLANT FAILURES.
In a best-case scenario, applying a patch requires restarting software. This can be
challenging for a plant that operates 24/7. Even if a plant or manufacturing facility
runs a regular business workday, patching at any time introduces the risk of failure.
If applying a patch fails, the system may need to be re-installed or even restored from
a backup. This takes time and production may come to a halt.
OTHER ALTERNATE, LESS DISRUPTIVE MITIGATIONS CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS
RESTRICTING THE PORT NUMBERS FOR NETWORK-EXPOSED VULNERABLE
SERVICES.
A firewall can be used to restrict access to the affected service, reducing risk until a
patch can be applied. Other mitigations include implementing configuration changes
that disable a vulnerable feature, file extensions that make it possible to monitor
inbound email attachments, web proxy servers and file change permissions without
affecting the program functionality, or network monitoring for exploitation of the
vulnerabilities.

5 Security Controls for a WorldClass OT Cybersecurity Program
Five years ago, the Dragos YIR was designed to drive insights into where the ICS/OT community
defenses are and to better describe the threats and vulnerabilities that are unique to industrial
environments.
This multi-year data set and the findings from this year’s report point to clear security controls that
can put organizations on a path to a more safe and reliable industrial process. Dragos recommends
that organizations focus on key security controls that can be done well, as opposed to spreading the
focus across too many possibilities. There are many IT security controls that have a significantly
reduced value when applied to OT or can introduce risk to the OT environment. Taking this into
consideration, here are the five security controls that when implemented have the best value in
significantly enhancing ICS/OT networks against cyber threats.

A DEFENSIBLE ARCHITECTURE
Network architects can leverage traditional tools and concepts such as strong
segmentation, firewalls, or software defined networks to reduce cyber risk. This can
take a variety of forms such as IEC62443 zones and conduits, DMZs, jumphosts, etc.
A key component of a defensible architecture is the ability to add humans to make
it a defended architecture. As an example, unmanaged switches and flat networks
are an indefensible architecture in most cases due to the inability for defenders to
get the data they need to act. Infrastructure preparation and data gathering is a core
requirement to being able to defend a network.
ICS NETWORK MONITORING
Visibility gained from monitoring your industrial assets validates the security
controls implemented in a defensible architecture. Threat detection from monitoring
allows for scaling and automation for large and complex networks. Additionally,
monitoring can also identify vulnerabilities easily for action.
To gain the values of ICS network monitoring ensure that the organization can
monitor East/West traffic inside the ICS network and do so with an understanding
of the ICS protocols and what is happening within them. The unique system-ofsystems nature of ICS means there’s a higher emphasis on network monitoring than
on endpoint monitoring though both should be done when possible.

| ICS/OT CYBERSECURITY YEAR IN REVIEW 2021

REMOTE ACCESS AUTHENTICATION
The most effective control for remote access authentication is multi-factor
authentication (MFA). Where MFA is not possible, consider alternate controls such as
jumphosts with focused monitoring. The focus should be placed on connections in
and out of the OT network and not on connections inside the network.
KEY VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
The majority of vulnerabilities do not need to be addressed if you have a defensible
architecture. Dragos recommends defenders prioritize those that bridge IT and
OT over those residing deep within the OT network or those that fall into the
“Remediate” category in Dragos’s vulnerability analysis. In short, roughly 4% of
vulnerabilities this year met this qualification.
ICS INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN (IRP)
Lastly, Dragos recommends that industrial organizations have a dedicated incident
response plan (IRP) for their ICS/OT environments, and that these organizations regularly exercise the plan with cross-disciplinary teams (IT, OT, Executives, etc.).
One very effective way of utilizing an incident response retainer with a provider like
Dragos, or others, is to have a Tabletop Exercise against a real threat scenario the
organization is concerned about and use that to drive alignment across the organization. The scenario and TTX should also be used to identify use-cases and key tactics,
techniques, and procedures security operations personnel should be monitoring for
instead of expecting them to identify and analyze every anomaly that occurs.
