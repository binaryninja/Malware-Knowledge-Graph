Introduction
A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows the attacker (client) to gain
control of the target’s device (server) to remotely control it. RATs are one of the most
important threats nowadays since they are used as part of most attacks, from APTs to
Ransomware. It is not an easy task to detect RATs in the network traffic, especially when it
comes to Android RATs in phones. Why? The main problem is that there are no easy ways
to look at the network traffic on our mobile devices. Our phones are much harder to protect
than our computers. Even in cases where there are external network traffic analyzers, there
are no good RAT detectors. To approach the problem of the lack of Android RATs detection
in the network traffic, we want to help the community by creating the Android Mischief
Dataset, which contains network traffic from mobile phones infected with real and working
Android RATs.
The Android Mischief Dataset is part of the Civilsphere Project
(https://www.civilsphereproject.org/), which aims to protect the civil society at risk by
understanding how the attacks work and how we can stop them. Check the webpage for
more information.

The Android Mischief Dataset
The Android Mischief Dataset is a dataset of network traffic from mobile phones infected
with Android RATs. Its goal is to offer the community a dataset to learn and analyze the
network behaviour of RATs, in order to propose new detections to protect our devices. The
current version of the dataset includes 7 packet captures from 7 executed Android RATs.
The Android Mischief Dataset was done in the Stratosphere Laboratory, Czech Technical
University in Prague.

Execution Methodology
To create this dataset, we followed a methodology for each of the RATs. The methodology
consists of the following 4 steps: (i) Installation, (ii) Execution, (iii) Traffic Capture, and (iv)
Dataset Logging
1. Installation. This step consists of searching for the code of the RAT on the Internet,
downloading it, installing an appropriate virtual machine for execution of the RAT’s
controller, including all the library requirements on the virtual machine (e.g .NET
Framework, JRE), and finally preparing the physical phone or phone virtual emulator
as a victim to infect.
2. Execution. In this step we execute the downloaded RAT in these steps. First, use the
Builder app in the Windows VM to create and build a new APK file. Second, start the
RAT Controller in the Windows VM so it is ready to receive victims. Third, send the
APK to the phone
3. Traffic Capture. When performing actions in the controller and the server, we capture
the network traffic using our own VPN server, or in case of Android virtual emulator,
we can use the computer network interface.
4. Dataset Logging. When performing actions in the client and the server, we also write
a log file of the performed actions and take screenshots for each action in the
Controller and the phone. As a result, each RAT in the dataset includes an APK file, a
log file, screenshots files, a pcap file and a README.md.

Dataset files for each executed RAT
Each RAT of the dataset contains the following files:
1. README.md - This file is the generic description of the execution, containing the
name of the executed RAT, details of the RAT execution environment, details of the
pcap (client’s IP and server’s IP, time of start of the infection).
2. APK - The APK file generated by the RAT’s builder. Be aware that the APK was built
for our own servers, so it can not be used in a real attack.
3. log - very detailed and specific time log of all the actions performed in the client and
the server during the experiment, e.g “2020-08-11 10:20:21 controller: execute
command ‘Take Photo - Back Camera’”. The purpose of this log is to let the
researchers match the actions with the packets in the pcap.
4. pcap - network traffic of the whole infection. Sometimes captured on the host
computer running the controller VM, sometimes using the Emergency VPN software.

5. screenshots - a folder with screenshots of the mobile device and controller while
performing the actions on the client and the server.

Executed RATs and Download
The first version of the Android Mischief Dataset, v1, includes the following 7 RATs: Android
Tester v6.4.6, DroidJack v4.4, HawkShaw, SpyMax v2.0, AndroRAT, Saefko Attack Systems
v4.9 and AhMyth.
The Android Mischief Dataset can be downloaded in two ways, as one zip file containing all
the RATs together, or it can be downloaded each RAT individually.
