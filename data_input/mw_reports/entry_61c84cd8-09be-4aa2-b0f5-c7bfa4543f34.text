Introduction
Remcos RATs are delivered by phishing campaigns in form of Excel file and Word file, our
sample is word file. Which tries to trick the user to click Enable content which will load the
Macro code and then load the next stage. We start our analysis using REMnux. Download
the sample from MalwareBazaar

About MS word
We will talk about basic structure of Word file. Microsoft suite comes in two two structures.
Before 2007 , Microsoft used structured storage fromat in binary format which is
old format .doc , .xls , .ppt such as from Word 97 (released in 1997) through Microsoft
Office 2003. After 2007, Microsoft used office open XML format in Zip archive containing
XML .docx . For more info see here

Metadata
using exiftool to extract metadata about the sample which we are analyzing and get more
information about it such as filesize , filetype , Language Code , Comp Obj User
Type which shows the eddition of used Microsoft word, and Template . If there is
Normal.dotm which is an indicator of Macro inside the Doc file.

VBA extraction and analysis
Then we try to see if the Doc file has a Macros using oleid . If VBA Macros is set to
True as we see in next figure, then yes it has Macros and the Macro is not encrypted.

3/7

Figure(1): oleid output

Then we extract the We Then use oledump.py to see the content of the Doc file. The
number on the left called stream number and M indicated that there is Macro and code.

Figure(2): oledump.py output

We use olevba to extract Macros from the Doc file and analyze the VBA code. After
extraction open the file in VSCode . We can use oledump.py to do this as well, but
olevba summerize the important info for us.
olevba 3bd5892cdc82dc4576eaf2735edb57182ae8b91c8067be305d4e801197d390cc.doc
> vbacode.vba

The most important is the table which summerize the VBA code and extracts the important
code such as IoCs and suspicious functions such as AutoOpen() .

Figure(3): Extraction of the VBA code

But this is not enough. We will try to extract much info about the Doc by using oledump.py
and extract the content of all the streams but if you want to short your time extract only the
streams 9 and 10 .
oledump.py
3bd5892cdc82dc4576eaf2735edb57182ae8b91c8067be305d4e801197d390cc.doc -s 9 >
stream_9.vba
oledump.py
3bd5892cdc82dc4576eaf2735edb57182ae8b91c8067be305d4e801197d390cc.doc -s 10 >
stream_10.vba

Take your time to analyze the ASCII to extract more info from the next two figures. In this
figure, stream 9 IoCs which enables the Doc to launch the VBA code.

And in stream 10 which has less IoCs than stream 9 .

6/7

Figure(5): Analysis of the VBA code of stream 10

For more info you can use lazy office analyzer tool in Windows or open the malicious
word and see the Macro inside the Microsoft word application. I tried to use it but in this
sample gives no info.

IoCs
No.
