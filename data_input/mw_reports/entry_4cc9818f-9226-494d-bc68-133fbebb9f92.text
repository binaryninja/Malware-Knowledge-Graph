Threat Analysis
Wednesday, February 27, 2019 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team

Summary
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have tracked the activities of the BRONZE UNION threat group
(also known as Emissary Panda, APT 27, and LuckyMouse) since 2013. CTU™ analysis suggests that BRONZE UNION is
located in the People's Republic of China. The threat group has historically leveraged a variety of publicly available and
self-developed tools to gain access to targeted networks in pursuit of its political and military intelligence-collection
objectives.

Breathing new life into old tools
In 2018, CTU researchers identified evidence of BRONZE UNION leveraging tools that have been publicly available for
years. However, the variants used in 2018 included updated code.

ZxShell games
In mid-2018, CTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION deploying an updated version of the ZxShell remote access
trojan (RAT). ZxShell was developed in 2006 by the persona "LZX", who then publicly released the source code in 2007.
Although various threat actors have created different variations of the RAT, the version used by BRONZE UNION in 2018
contained some previously unobserved properties that suggest the threat group's capabilities continue to evolve:
The malware embedded the well-known HTran packet redirection tool.
The malware was signed with digital certificates that were signed by Hangzhou Shunwang Technology Co., Ltd
(Serial: 29 f7 33 6f 60 92 3a f0 3e 31 f2 a5) and Shanghai Hintsoft Co., Ltd. (Serial: 09 89 c9 78 04 c9 3e c0 00 4e 28
43). These certificates are not exclusively used by BRONZE UNION but may indicate BRONZE UNION activity.

ZxShell.

"You look like you've seen a Gh0st RAT"
Like ZxShell, publicly available Gh0st RAT source code led to the emergence of several different variants. In a 2018
campaign, BRONZE UNION likely deployed modified Gh0st RAT malware to multiple systems within a compromised
environment that were important to the threat actors' objective. When executed with administrator privileges, the Gh0st

RAT binary file was written to %System%\FastUserSwitchingCompatibilitysex.dll. The installer then created a Windows
service and associated service dynamic link library (DLL) chosen from the names listed in Table 1.

Table 1. Service names and DLLs used by Gh0st RAT.
This Gh0st RAT sample communicated with IP address 43 . 242 . 35 . 16 on TCP port 443, although the traffic is a custom
binary protocol and not HTTPS. The malware author also modified the standard Gh0st RAT headers to obfuscate the
network traffic (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Gh0st RAT network traffic. (Source: Secureworks)
Bytes 0-4, which are typically known as the Gh0st RAT "identifier," are randomized in this case. Bytes 5-8 indicate the
packet size, and bytes 9-12 indicate the zlib-decompressed packet size. In a departure from previous Gh0st RAT versions,
the five bytes at the end of this packet are an XOR key, which must be applied to the packet data before the zlib
decompression can be performed. The XOR key is different for each execution of the malware. Once the packet is
decoded and decompressed, the data shown in Figure 3 is visible.

Figure 3. Decoded Gh0st RAT check-in packet. (Source: Secureworks)
The first byte of Figure 3 shows the value 0x66, which is the Gh0st RAT code for "login". After sending the initial phonehome request, Gh0st RAT exchanges 22-byte 'command' packets with its command and control (C2) server. Once again,
the first five bytes are randomized and the zlib-compressed part of the packet is XOR-encoded, but the same identifiable
structure remains. In the example command packet shown in Figure 4, the first five bytes are the randomized header
and the next eight bytes show the compressed and uncompressed size of the data. The XOR key for this packet is 0x7c.

Creating custom solutions
In addition to publicly available tools, BRONZE UNION has also used proprietary remote access tools such as SysUpdate
and HyperBro since 2016. Despite self-developed tools generally benefitting from lower detection rates than publicly
available tools, the threat actors appear to use their own tools more sparingly after securing consistent network access.
SysUpdate is a multi-stage malware used exclusively by BRONZE UNION. It has been delivered by multiple methods. In
one instance observed by CTU researchers, it was downloaded by a malicious Word document using the Dynamic Data
Exchange (DDE) embedded command method. In another incident, the threat actor manually deployed SysUpdate via
previously stolen credentials after gaining access to the environment. In a third case, it was delivered via a redirect from
a strategic web compromise (SWC). Regardless of the delivery method, the payload is a WinRAR self-extracting (SFX) file
that installs the SysUpdate stage 1 payload.
The stage 1 payload is responsible for the following tasks:
installing the stage 1 malware through DLL search-order hijacking
setting up persistence by configuring either a registry Run key (see Figure 5) or an "Own Process" Windows service
depending on privileges available at the time of installation
contacting a C2 server to retrieve and install a second malware payload

SysUpdate stage 1 has no capability beyond downloading the second payload file, SysUpdate Main (see Figure 6).

Figure 6. SysUpdate stage 1 installation process. (Source: Secureworks)
SysUpdate Main employs HTTP communications and uses the hard-coded User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;
WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36". It downloads a file named
m.bin using the HTTP GET method and injects this file into a new svchost.exe process without saving the file to disk. After
performing this download, SysUpdate Main reverts to its binary protocol for any additional commands from the C2
server, beaconing every three minutes. The SysUpdate Main file analyzed by CTU researchers included remote access
capabilities such as managing files and processes, launching a command shell, interacting with services, taking
screenshots, and uploading and downloading additional malware payloads.
SysUpdate is flexible malware, as capabilities can be easily introduced and withdrawn by supplying a new payload file.
The operator could remove second-stage capabilities at any time and revert to the first stage by supplying a replacement
payload file. By withdrawing second-stage payloads when not in use, operators can limit exposure of their full
capabilities if the malicious activity is detected.

Conclusion

4/9

BRONZE UNION was one of the most prolific and active targeted threat groups tracked by CTU researchers in 2017 and
2018. The threat actors have access to a wide range of tools, so they can operate flexibly and select tools appropriate for
intrusion challenges. During complex intrusion scenarios, the threat actors leverage their proprietary tools, which offer
custom functionality and lower detection rates. They appear to prefer using widely available tools and web shells to
maintain access to networks over longer periods. After accessing a network, the threat actors are adept at circumventing
common security controls, escalating privileges, and maintaining their access to high-value systems over long periods of
time.
