The Evolving Threat Landscape in 2016

WHITE PAPER: NEW RULES: THE EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE IN 2016

The threat landscape is in a constant state of evolution and the arms race between cyber guardians and cyber
criminals has been heating up dramatically over the course of the last year. Over 20 billion devices are expected to
be connected in the next four years alone, forcing individuals and organizations to face an exponentially expanding
attack surface, bound to a borderless cyberspace. The consequences of falling behind in this arms race can be
catastrophic and have elevated the discussion of cybersecurity to the boardroom. This is a complex scenario, and
complexity is the enemy of security.
These predictions will provide an historical overview of the evolving threat landscape, reveal the new trends and
strategies that Fortinet researchers anticipate cyber criminals will employ in the year to come, and demonstrate how
Fortinet is proactively positioned to change the way businesses look at their security strategy going into the new year.

20 billion+

devices are expected to be
connected in the next four years
Prediction #1: The Rise of Machine to Machine Attacks
The Threat: The exponential increase of unmanaged, “headless devices” driven by the Internet of Things will make these types of
devices a tempting target for hackers looking to secure a beachhead into more traditional devices and corporate infrastructures. We
will see a rise in the number of attacks that exploit flaws in trusted machine to machine (M2M) communication protocols.

Background:
nn2015 was the first year that IoT device attacks rose into

FortiGuard’s top 10 threat list.
nnPoint of Sale (PoS) malware also entered the top 10 list in

Japan.
nnResearchers Miller and Valasek demonstrated flaws enabling

them to compromise and control a connected vehicle in
motion and estimate that there are 471,000 vehicles that could
be vulnerable to attack.
nnFortiGuard threat research has seen a significant increase

in attacks that target connected consumer devices like IP
Cameras.
nnGartner predicts that there will be more than 20 billion IoT

devices by 2020.

Future Outlook:
nnExploits and malware will be developed that target trusted

communication protocols and APIs: Bluetooth, RFID, NFC,
Wi-Fi, Zigbee, etc.
nnLand and Expand tactics start further away from defensive

core as lucrative corporate networks implement better
cyber defenses. Hackers will target devices further into their
employees’ personal technology ecosystems to establish an
initial beachhead.
nnConnected medical devices and their host applications are

a high-value target as the industry moves to adopt new
technologies like medicine pumps, hospital bed sensors, smart
blood pressure cuffs and others.
nnExploits in connected home automation devices like smart

TVs, cameras, smart locks, lights, etc. will be used as
an entryway into personal data and used as a vector to
compromise corporate-issued devices. Home routers and
networking continue to be highly targeted by hackers.

Prediction #2: Headless Worms Target Headless Devices
The Threat: Related to the rise in machine to machine attacks, the “headless devices” driven by the Internet of Things will also
become a focus of worms and viruses that are designed to independently target and automatically propagate to other devices via
trusted communication protocols. These viruses could be designed to cause the systematic failure of devices and the damages would
be far more substantial as the numbers of IoT devices grows into the billions.
Background:
nn1971: The Creeper Virus was the first worm in history and was

a proof of concept of a virus autonomously spreading through
the TENEX Operating System.
nn1989: The Morris worm was designed to propagate through

Unix operating systems and resulted in an estimated
$100,000-$10,000,000 in damages. The first CERT team was
established to combat this threat.
nnOther notable worms: ILOVEYOU (2000), Anna Kournikova

(2001), Slammer & Blaster (2003).
nnThere are various worms today that are designed to infect

embedded devices such as home routers, but these have
User Interfaces and connectivity features that allow them to be
managed and infections remediated. Two examples of similar
types of worms are “TheMoon” (2014) and “Moose” (2015)
worms that exploit vulnerabilities in specific consumer routers.

Future Outlook:
nnThe Morris worm struck at a time where there were only

60,000 devices connected to the internet and estimates put
the number of infected devices at around 6,000 or 10%. This
number becomes far more substantial for popular devices like
fitness trackers that currently have tens of millions of devices
sold and in use.
nnFortiGuard’s research shows that it is possible to infect

headless devices with small amounts of code. Exploits like
these could lead to device to device propagation of worms,
i.e. smartwatch to smartwatch malware, that spread through
trusted communication protocols.

Prediction #3: Jailbreaking the Cloud
The Threat: As adoption of virtualization and cloud strategies increases, hackers are developing strategies to break out of
hypervisors and infect the larger infrastructures and systems. Hackers will start targeting malware that exploits flaws in virtualization
protocols to jailbreak the cloud and gain access to wider infrastructure data.
Background:
nnAs adoption of cloud and virtualization strategies increases,

Future Outlook:
nnCloud and virtualization adoption rates are increasing, making

more and more systems are utilizing hypervisor processes to
monitor code within end user environments.

this the next big target for hackers looking to extract valuable
corporate data and personal information.

nnKnown strategies to break out of the hypervisors have existed

nnWe expect to see malware in the wild that is designed to break

since vmftp in 2007, along with KVM Virtunoid in 2011 and
others.

out of hypervisors and gain access to host systems in order to
infect wider corporate networks.

nn2015: A decade old vulnerability from 2004 known as Venom

nnHackers may attempt to build malware into mobile application

exploited floppy disk drivers to break out of a hypervisor and

downloads for devices like smartphones and tablets that are

gain access to host operating systems.

used to remotely access virtual environments and resources.

Prediction #4: Ghostware Conceals Indicators of Compromise
The Threat: As cybercriminals become the focus of investigation and prosecution in the criminal justice system, careful hackers will
develop a new variant of malware that is designed to achieve its mission and then erase all traces before security measures can detect
that a compromise has taken place. FortiGuard predicts that we will witness Ghostware in 2016, written to steal data and disappear to
conceal its creators.

WHITE PAPER: NEW RULES: THE EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE IN 2016

Background:

Future Outlook:

nnCriminal Justice agencies are doubling down on investigation,

nnNew variants of Blastware will persist in targeted attacks,

attribution and prosecution of the perpetrators of cybercrimes.

primarily utilized in acts of hacktivism or state-sponsored
cybercrime.

nnHackers will take a page from popular identity and content

protection services like Snapchat, developing Ghostware that
achieves a mission and then erases all traces of its existence.
nnFortinet predicted the rise of Blastware, first surfacing in the

form of Rombertik, which performs checks once it has been
installed to determine if it has been detected, self-destructing
and permanently crashing the host system to avoid detection.

nnGhostware will emerge that can exploit a system or

infrastructure to extricate valuable data, then erase itself while
leaving the host system intact.
nnGhostware attacks will enable hackers to cast a wider net for

infection while attempting to avoid identification and attribution
for the crimes.

Prediction #5: Two-Faced Malware
The Threat: Malware has been continually evolving features to avoid detection as security measure like sandboxing become more
prevalent. As Sandboxing become more resistant to these countermeasures, we anticipate the development of Two-Faced Malware
designed to execute an innocent task to avoid detection and then execute the malicious process once it has cleared security protocols.

Background:

Future Outlook:

nn2011: The Unitrix exploit executes various benign Unicode

nnNew malware will be written that employs multiple code

features to mask itself from detection engines.

execution paths that are designed to execute a benign
process while under inspection and then execute its malicious
process once clear.

nn2014: The Neutrino Botnet utilized various anti-detection

strategies to avoid being discovered by antivirus and
sandboxing features.

nnTwo-faced Malware will be engineered to deliver counter threat

nnMany sandbox solutions utilize a rating system based on

the observed behavior of the files they are monitoring. If the
sandboxes observe benign and typical behaviors, they will
assign “innocent” ratings that can be reported back through
a security vendor’s threat intelligence system. This could
effectively enable an “all clear” that lets future versions of the
files through deterrents like sandboxes.

intelligence and exploit the rating systems used by sandboxes
and antivirus solutions. This counter threat intelligence can
enable future variations of malware to bypass advanced
security protection systems.
nnThese malware types will require stronger scrubbing and

verification systems on the security vendor end. This could
impact network performance and decrease the rate of
adoption for more advanced security solutions.
