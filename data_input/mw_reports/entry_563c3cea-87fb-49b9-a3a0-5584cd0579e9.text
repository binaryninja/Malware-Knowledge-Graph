PhishLabs is monitoring the increasing number of mobile applications targeted by the
relatively new Alien Mobile Banking Trojan. Alien, a fork of Cerberus, continues to evade
Google’s malware detection and is targeting a broad spectrum of both financial and nonfinancial apps. So far, Alien has been connected with 87 new brands previously not targeted
by Cerberus.

Cerberus versus Alien Brands Targeted
Prior to its decline, Cerberus operators dominated the mobile malware landscape both in
functionality and attacks. Cerberus was a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and targeted 139
known brands during its life.
Since January 2020, Alien has been observed targeting 226 different brands. Alien’s high
volume of targets may be attributed to its adoption by a growing number of threat actors
eager to take advantage of desirable enhancements that increase the success of executing
fraud. It also uses a MaaS approach with built-in features that can achieve a wide range of
objectives.
Specifically, Alien has capabilities not previously seen with Cerberus, such as the ability to
install and navigate Android’s TeamViewer. Using TeamViewer gives the operator full remote
control access to the infected device, as well as the ability to change device settings, interact
with applications, and monitor user behavior.
Alien authors have also incorporated a notification sniffer that allows access to all new
updates on infected devices. This includes the ability to steal tokens from Google’s
Authenticator application, enabling actors to bypass two-factor authentication security
measures.
Alien does possess the features originally associated with Cerberus, including keylogging,
SMS harvesting, and dynamic overlays.

Financial Institutions versus Non-Financials Targeted by Alien
Notably, we continue to observe Alien being used to target an increasing number of nonfinancial institutions compared to other mobile and desktop malware. This approach boosts
the effectiveness of Alien distribution by taking advantage of how individuals may be less
vigilant when interacting with non-financial applications not traditionally associated with
fraud.
While there is inherent value in capturing email credentials, Alien operators are using custom
overlays with dynamic targeting to increasingly capture financial credentials from nonfinancial apps. Operators are able to pick their desired targets from a list of installed apps
sent by the infected device, then supplant the actual application on the screen with an
overlay. This overlay is customized HTML code that resembles the target app and elicits
payment or identity verification from the victim.
Below is an example of Alien operators impersonating a popular video streaming service to
steal both email and credit card information.

Fake Credit Card Entry
Alien’s enhanced features and broader targeting capabilities appear to be making it the
mobile MaaS of choice for threat actors. As long as it continues to evade Android’s security
controls, we expect adoption of Alien to continue increasing.
