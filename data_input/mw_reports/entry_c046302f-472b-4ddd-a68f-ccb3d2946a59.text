This is a case i started investigating in March 2019 after one of my VT hunting rules raised
an alarm of a newly submitted file, matching my generic search pattern for ATM malware. An
interesting case with a very unlikely ATM malware and a bad opsec during the IR process
which made it possible for me to restruct a lot of details about this cyber heist.
