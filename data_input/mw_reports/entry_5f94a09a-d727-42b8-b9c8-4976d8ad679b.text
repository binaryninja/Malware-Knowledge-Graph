Abstract
SectorJ04 is a Russian-based cybercrime group that began operating about ﬁve years ago and
conducted hacking activities for ﬁnancial proﬁt using malware such as banking trojans and
ransomware against national and industrial sectors located across Europe, North America and
West Africa.
In 2019, the SectorJ04 group expanded its hacking activities to cover various industrial sectors
located across Southeast Asia and East Asia, and is changing the pattern of their attacks from
targeted attacks to searching for random victims. This report includes details related to the major
hacking targets of the SectorJ04 group in 2019, how those targets were hacked, characteristics of
their hacking activities this year and recent cases of the SectorJ04 group’s hacking.

SectorJ04 group activity range and hacking methods
The SectorJ04 group has maintained the scope of its existing hacking activities while expanding
its hacking activities to companies in various industrial sectors located in East Asia and Southeast
Asia. There was a signiﬁcant increase in their hacking activities in 2019, especially those
targeting South Korea. They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their backdoor to the infected
system that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s server.

Main countries and sectors targeted
The SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were ﬁnancial institutions located in countries such as
North America and Europe, or general companies such as retail and manufacturing, but they
recently expanded their areas of activity to include the medical, pharmaceutical, media, energy
and manufacturing industries. They do not appear to place much restrictions on the sectors
targeted. The following are the sectors and countries under which SectorJ04 group was found in
2019.

Hacking Techniques
The SectorJ04 group mainly utilizes a spear phishing email with MS Word or Excel ﬁles attached,
and the document ﬁles downloads the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation ﬁle from the attacker
server and uses it to install backdoor on the infected system. As anti-virus programs have
recently begun to detect MSI ﬁles, in some instances macro scripts contained in the malicious
documents would install backdoors directly onto infected systems without using MSI ﬁles.

Malicious documents used for hacking are mainly written as themes related to MS Ofﬁce, and the
same themes are often used several times, with only language changes depending on the
victim’s language.
In addition, the MSI ﬁles backdoor used by SectorJ04 mostly had valid digital signatures, and
most of their malware were signed just days before they were found.

Main Malware Used
The SectorJ04 group mainly used their own backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT, for
hacking. They also used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) RAT, a legitimate remote
management software created in Russia. Backdoors are installed in infected systems and they
also distributed email stealers, botnet malware and ransomware through those backdoors.
They were recently conﬁrmed to use additional backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi, which
is used to install other backdoor such as FlawedAmmy RAT on behalf of the MSI ﬁle, or to collect
system information and send it to the attacker’s server.

Backdoor installed in the infected system distributed additional botnet malware, ransomware and
email stealers. The email stealer collects connection protocol information and account
information, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, which are stored in the registry by Outlook and
Thunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a speciﬁc format.

An email stealer may also have a ﬁle collection function to collect email information that is
recorded in the metadata of the ﬁle corresponding to the hard-coded extension. In addition, the
malware eventually creates and executes a batch ﬁle for self-delete, removing the execution
traces from the infected PC.

Characteristics of hacking activities of SectorJ04 group in 2019
The following are the features of the ﬁrst half of 2019 activities identiﬁed through the analysis of
the SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities.
Increased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia
Changes in spam email format and hacking methods
Changes in targets of hacking from speciﬁc organizations and industry groups to large
number of irregular ones

SectorJ04 Group’s Increased Activity in 2019 – ThreatRecon

Although the SectorJ04 group mainly targeted countries located in Europe or North America, it
has recently expanded its ﬁeld of activities to countries located in Southeast Asia and East Asia.
In particular, the frequency of hacking attacks targeting South Korea has increased, and spam
emails targeting China were found in May.
The changes could also be seen in attachments to spam emails used by attackers. Existing spam
emails used attachments in the form of malicious documents, but attachments with HTM and
HTML extensions were also found and the text included links to download malicious documents
directly.
The SectorJ04 group’s initial spam emails had no mail content or only short sentences, but the
latest spam emails found were elaborately written and included images. A new type of backdoor
called AdroMut and a new malware called FlowerPippi was also found coming from SectorJ04.
Prior to 2019, the SectorJ04 group conducted large-scale hacking activities for ﬁnancial gain
using exploit kits on websites to install ransomware, such as Locky and GlobeImporter, along with
its banking Trojan, on its victims computers. But after 2019 the group has changed its hacking
strategy to attack using spam email. In particular, a number of remote control malware are utilized
to gain access to resources such as email accounts and system login information from the
infected machine to send more spam emails and distribute their malware.

Increased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia
The hacking activities of SectorJ04 group, which targeted South Korea in the ﬁrst half of 2019,
have been continuously discovered. The emails found were written in relation to invoice and tax
accounting data, and were attached the MS Word or Excel ﬁles with malicious macros inserted.
Malicious documents written in Korean have the same characteristics as other language hacking
activities under the theme of MS Ofﬁce.
Figure 10 Spear phishing emails
disguised as order sheets
In June 2019, continuous hacking
activities targeting South Korea were
found again and spam emails were
written with various contents,
including transaction statements,
receipts and remittance cards. During
that period, a number of spam emails
disguised as remittance cards of the
same type were found.

The SectorJ04 group has carried out large-scale hacking activities targeting South Korea, while
also expanding the ﬁeld of attacks to Southeast Asian countries such as Taiwan and the
Philippines. Spam emails and attachments written in Chinese were found in May, and the
SectorJ04 group at that time targeted industrial sectors such as electronics and
telecommunications, international schools and manufacturing.

Changes in spam email format and hacking methods
In June, SectorJ04 group conducted hacking using spam emails written in various languages,
including English, Arabic, Korean and Italian, and the emails were written with various contents,
including remittance card, invoice and tax invoice.
Along with the existing method of using MS Word or Excel ﬁles as attachments, they used HTML
ﬁles to download malicious documents as attachments, or included links to download malicious
documents directly in the text.
In the past, the emails used in attacks had little or no content, but the latest ones use elaborated
spam emails for hacking, such as using images.

Changes have also been found in the hacking method of the SectorJ04 group. In addition to their
preexist backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmy, they have also been conﬁrmed to use the
backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi.
AdroMut downloads the malware (ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT) used by the SectorJ04
group from the attacker server and simultaneously performs the functions of a backdoor.
FlowerPippi collects infection system information, such as the domain of the infected system,
proxy settings, administrator rights, and OS version, and performs functions such as executing
commands received, downloading and executing DLL and EXE ﬁles.

Figure 17 RC4 key with hard-coded view from the FlowerPippi back door
The SectorJ04 group is believed to have developed and used malware that functions as a
downloader for the purpose of installing or downloading malware to replace the MSI installation
ﬁles that they have used for hacking for more than six months as the detection rate of security
solutions increased.

Figure 18 Some of the digital certiﬁcate information identiﬁed in the corresponding hacking activity
The SectorJ04 group, which has been utilizing the same pattern of infection and the same
malware for more than six months, is believed to be attempting to change its infection methods
such as downloading malware directly from malicious documents without using MSI installation
ﬁles, changing their spam email format and using new types of backdoor.

Changes in hacking targets from speciﬁc organizations and industries
to random ones
Until 2019, SectorJ04 group had carried out massive website-based hacking activities that mainly
utilize ransomware and banking trojans for ﬁnancial proﬁt, and has also been carrying out
information gathering activities to secure attack resources such as email accounts and system
login information from users since 2019.
This allows them to expand their range of targets of hacking activities for ﬁnancial proﬁt, and in
this regard, SectorJ04 group has been found to have hacked into a company’s internal network
by using a spear phishing email targeting executives and employees of certain South Korean
https://threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/08/29/sectorj04-groups-increased-activity-in-2019/
companies around February 2019.

They eventually hacked the Active Directory (AD) server and took control of the entire corporate
internal network, and then distributed the Clop ransomware on the AD server. From the hacking
activity, we also found malware for collecting email information and “AmadeyBot”, a botnet
malware that which has its source code available in Russia’s underground forums.

National Tax Service in May to install
FlawedAmmy RAT in the infected
system, during which the Clop
ransomware was found using the
same certiﬁcate as the FlawedAmmy
RAT executable ﬁle.

changed from targeted attacks to a
large-scale distribution of spam.

Major Malware Installation Types
The following describes three types of backdoor infections that are installed from malicious
documents identiﬁed in the SectorJ04 group-related hacking cases that occurred during the ﬁrst
half of 2019.

Type 1 – Using encoded executable ﬁle
SectorJ04 group carried out intensive hacking on various industrial sectors, including South
Korea’s media, manufacturing and universities, around February and March 2019. They used the
spear phishing email to spread malicious Excel or malicious Word ﬁles, and downloaded the MSI
ﬁles from the attacker’s server when the malicious documents were run.

The MSI ﬁle installs a downloader that downloads FlawedAmmy RAT encoded in the infection
system from the attacker server, and the downloaded FlawedAmmy RAT registers an automatic
execution under the name “wsus.exe.”

Figure 21 Type of backdoor installation to install encoded executable ﬁle Type 1
FlawedAmmy RAT performs remote control functions in the infected system and decodes
encoded executable ﬁles downloaded from the attacker server using certain hard-coded strings. It
also has a function to check if a particular process is running to determine whether their malware
should be executed.

SectorJ04 group conducted hacking activities targeting ﬁnancial institutions located in India and
Hong Kong around April 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear phishing email
downloaded the MSI ﬁle, which forwards the NSIS Installer to the infected system. The NSIS
script executes the ﬁnal payload, ServHelper, in the DLL ﬁle format, using “rundll32.exe”.
Note that NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a script-based installation system for
Windows and is a lightweight installation system supported by Nullsoft.

Figure 24 Backdoor installation type utilizing NSIS Installer Type 2
Decompressing the NSIS installer installed by the MSI ﬁle shows that it consists of an NSIS script
with an NSI extension, a ServHelper in the DLL ﬁle format, and a “ncExec.dll,” the normal DLL
required to run the NSIS.

Figure 25 Uncompressed NSIS installer

Figure 26 Part of the NSIS script for running ServHelper in the DLL ﬁle format
ServHelper performs the function of the backdoor in the infection system and sends speciﬁc types
of responses to C2 servers using delimiters such as “key,” “sysid,” and “resp”. Different types of
delimiters are sometimes found depending on malware.

SectorJ04 group carried out hacking activities targeting ﬁnancial institutions located in Italy and
other countries around May 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear phishing
email pass MSI ﬁles to the infection system, and MSI ﬁles download the executable selfextracting ﬁle (SFX). When the SFX ﬁle is executed, another SFX ﬁle inside is executed and the
ﬁnal payload, RMS RAT, is delivered to the infected system.

Figure 28 Backdoor installation type utilizing SFX executable ﬁles Type 3
Within the ﬁrst SFX ﬁle to be downloaded by the MSI ﬁle, there are four ﬁles. When executing an
SFX ﬁle, it uses a command to change the extension of the SFX ﬁle (“kernel.dll”) of the DLL
extension to EXE and decompress it using a hard-coded password. The ﬁles that make up the
SFX ﬁle vary from malware to malware.

SectorJ04 Group Activity in South Korea
The following is about the activities of the SectorJ04 group found in South Korea in July and
August 2019.

Hacking activities disguised as electronic tickets by large airlines
In late July, SectorJ04 group used FlawedAmmy RAT to carry out hacking attacks on companies
and universities in sectors such as education, job openings, real estate and semiconductors in
South Korea. Spam emails targeting email accounts used in the integrated mail service of public
ofﬁcials were also found in the hacking activity.

They used spam emails disguised as those sent by large South Korean airlines and used ISOformat ﬁles as attachments. The group used the same body contents of the email to deliver spam
emails to multiple hacking targets.
Decompressing the ISO ﬁle attached to the spam email would show an SCR ﬁle disguised as a
“.pdf” extension exists, which is a .NET executable ﬁle that downloads an MSI ﬁle. The ISO ﬁles
sometimes contain LNK ﬁles, which, like the malware written in .NET, download an MSI ﬁles from
a remote location.

Hacking activity using same email content as the past
In early August, the SectorJ04 group carried out extensive hacking activities targeting the users
around the world, including South Korea, India, Britain, the United States, Germany, Canada,
Argentina, Bangladesh and Hong Kong.
Their activities were particularly heavy in healthcare-related areas such as healthcare,
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare-wage management, as well as energy-related
companies such as gas and wind power. Also, they continued their attacks on preexisting hacking
target areas such as manufacturing, distribution and retail.
The contents of the text written in French and English were found in the spam email, and an MS
Word ﬁle with random numbers was used as an attachment. All emails found in the hacking
activity had the same text content.
Figure 39 Spear phishing emails written in French and English
Spam emails in Korean were also identiﬁed in the hacking activity, indicating that the contents of
the text of the email used in the hacking activity were reused in June. Attached ﬁle is an MS Word

Conclusion
The SectorJ04 group’s range of targets increased sharply in 2019, and they appear to be striving
to carry out elaborated attacks while at the same time targeting indiscriminately. They are one of
the most active cyber crime groups in 2019, and they often modify and tweak their hacking
methods and perform periodic hacking activities.
The SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities are expected to continue to increase, and the
ThreatRecon team will continue to monitor the attack activity against the group.
