2013 Internet Crime Report
Executive Summary
Now in its 14th year of operation, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has firmly established its role as a
valuable resource for both victims of Internet crime and law enforcement agencies investigating and prosecuting
these crimes. For the victims, the IC3 provides a convenient and easy-to-use reporting mechanism that alerts
authorities to suspected criminal violations. For law enforcement agencies, the IC3 serves as a conduit to receive
Internet-related complaints, to conduct research related to them and to develop analytical reports for state, local,
federal, tribal or international law enforcement and regulatory agencies. These agencies then develop
investigations based on the forwarded information as appropriate. In 2013, the IC3 received 262,813 consumer
complaints with an adjusted dollar loss of $781,841,6111, which is a 48.8 percent increase in reported losses since
2012 ($581,441,110). The IC3 continues its efforts to inform the general public about online scams by publishing
public service announcements and providing tips for Internet consumers.
The IC3’s success attracts international interest. Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany use the IC3 as a
model for similar cybercrime centers. In furtherance of its continuing support of foreign law enforcement, the IC3
prepared dozens of country-specific statistical reports and disseminated hundreds of complaint referrals to FBI
legal attaché offices throughout the world. In 2014, the IC3 continues to pursue its mission to serve both the
online public and law enforcement and regulatory agencies throughout the entire global community.

Method of evaluating loss amounts: FBI IC3 Unit staff reviewed for validity all complaints that reported a loss of more than
$100,000. Analysts also converted losses reported in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. The final amounts of all reported
losses above $100,000 for which the complaint information did not support the loss amount were excluded from the statistics.

Project Partners
As a threat-based and intelligence-driven national security organization, the
mission of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is to protect and defend
the United States against terrorist and foreign intelligence threats, to uphold and
enforce the criminal laws of the United States and to provide leadership and
criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal and international agencies
and partners.

The mission of the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) is to provide
training, investigative support and research to agencies and entities involved
in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic and high-tech
crime. While the NW3C has no investigative authority itself, its job is to help
law enforcement agencies better understand and utilize tools to combat
economic and high-tech crime. The NW3C has other sections within its
organization, including Training (in Computer Crime, Financial Crime and
Intelligence Analysis), Research and Investigative Support Services. The
NW3C is funded by an annual Congressional appropriation through the
Bureau of Justice Assistance.

The IC3
The IC3 is a valuable resource for both victims of Internet crime and the law enforcement agencies identifying,
investigating and prosecuting these crimes. For the victims, the IC3 provides a convenient and easy-to-use
reporting mechanism that alerts authorities to suspected criminal violations. For law enforcement agencies, the
IC3 serves as a conduit to receive Internet-related complaints, to conduct research related to them and to develop
analytical reports based on them for state, local, federal, tribal or international law enforcement and regulatory
agencies. These agencies then develop investigations based on the forwarded information, as appropriate.

262,813
Complaints Reported
to the IC3 in 2013

How it Works
Victims file complaints with the IC3, which go into an extensive database. The IC3’s analysts review individual
complaint data, identifying and grouping complaints with similar information. These complaints are collated and
referred to state, local, federal, tribal and international law enforcement for potential investigation. Analysts also
collect relevant case information from both open and closed
sources. The IC3 analysts use automated matching systems to
identify links and commonalities between numerous complaints
and combine the respective complaints into referral groups for law
enforcement. Of the 262,813 complaints received in 2013, 45.5
percent (119,457) reported financial loss.
The IC3 offers remote access capability, making data available to
law enforcement anywhere. This Web-based access provides users
the ability to aggregate victims and losses to substantiate criminal
activity within the agency’s area of jurisdiction and to enhance
development of cases. Although the IC3 may not immediately
build all complaints into referrals, all complaints are helpful in
identifying trends and building statistical reports. These trends are
posted on the IC3’s website (www.ic3.gov) as public service
announcements in a continuing effort to educate the general public on constantly evolving cyber scams and crime.
The IC3 encourages victims of Internet crime to report all incidents to the IC3 – whether or not an actual dollar
loss is involved – due to the broad dissemination and varied uses of the data gathered from the complaints.

Internet Scams Reported to the IC3
The IC3 continues to receive a wide variety of complaints on a multitude of crime schemes. The true volume and
scope of cyber crime is unknown. What is known is that criminals continue to use a variety of scams to defraud
Internet users. These schemes range from simple frauds to complex hacking and malicious software or malware
scams. Some recurring and common crime schemes include:

Auto-Auction Fraud – The IC3 has received a significant number of complaints regarding Internet auction fraud
involving the sale of automobiles. Many of these listings are for vehicles located outside the United States. In
most cases the criminal attempts to sell vehicles they do not own. Criminals create attractive deals by advertising
vehicles at prices below book value. Often criminals claims they must sell the vehicle because they are moving or
being relocated for work. Due to the pending move, the criminals often refuse to meet with potential buyers or
allow vehicle inspections and ultimately try to rush the sale. In an attempt to make the deal appear legitimate, the
criminal often instructs victims to send full or partial payments to third-party agents via wire transfers and to fax
their payment receipt to the seller as proof of payment. Once payment is made, the criminal pockets the money
and the victim never receives the vehicle.

Romance Scams – The IC3 continues to receive complaints of romance scams in which scammers target

individuals searching for companionship or romance online. Victims believe they are “dating” a good
and honest person without ever physically meeting them. The online contact is often a criminal sitting in a
cyber café with a well-rehearsed script used to repeatedly and successfully scam others. Perpetrators of these
scams search chat rooms, dating sites, and social networking sites looking for potential targets. Although all
demographics are at risk, the group targeted the most appears to be people aged 40 years and older, divorced,
widowed, disabled, and often elderly.
Romance scammers use poetry, flowers, and other gifts to draw in their victims. They continuously declare their
“undying love” for victims. These criminals also use stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies, family deaths,
injuries to themselves, or other hardships to keep their victims concerned and involved in their schemes.
Scammers also ask victims to send money to help overcome alleged hardships.

FBI Scams – Perpetrators attempt to intimidate victims in emails by purporting to be high ranking government
officials. Many scams exploit the FBI name or the names of FBI executives such as the current FBI Director,
James Comey, and FBI former Director Robert Mueller, both of which had terms as the FBI’s Director during
2013. There were 4,391 complaints reported to the IC3 in 2013 that referenced both FBI Directors. The FBI
specific schemes typically remain the same as scammers just update their scam verbiage to reflect the current FBI
Director’s name. FBI impersonation schemes pose a viable threat to national security by undermining public trust
that directly impacts law enforcement’s ability to do its job. Government agencies do not send unsolicited e-mails
of this nature. While FBI, Department of Justice and other United States government executives are briefed on
numerous investigations, they do not personally contact consumers regarding such matters. United States
government agencies use the legal process to contact individuals. These agencies do not send threatening letters or
e-mails to consumers demanding payments for Internet crimes. The total FBI related scams reported to the IC3
during 2013 is represented in the chart below.

Hit Man Scam – The IC3 continues to receive reports about a hit man/extortion e-mail scheme. The scheme has
been around for several years but the content used in the e-mailed messages changes. The ultimate goal is for the
perpetrators to defraud people through disturbing e-mails. The scam originated as a person sending an e-mail
portraying himself as a hit man hired to kill the victim. The e-mail instructs the recipient to pay a fee to remain
safe and avoid having the hit carried out. Although the e-mail content is disturbing, the IC3 has not received any
reports of the loss of life.

Ransomware/Scareware Scams – The IC3 has received multiple complaints surrounding ransomware /scareware
schemes. These schemes are used to target and extort funds from victims by intimidating them. These scams
began years ago with false claims in which the perpetrators pretended to be federal government officials who
were watching or monitoring the victims’ Internet usage. Schemes continue to change and some of the most
reported schemes involve those discussed below.


Cryptolocker Ransomware – The IC3 became aware of the CryptoLocker scheme in October 2013. It
spreads via e-mail and propagates rapidly. The virus encrypts various file types and then a pop-up
window appears on victims’ computer that states their data has been encrypted. The only way to get it
back is to send a specified monetary payment to the perpetrator. This ransomware provides the victim
with a timeline to pay via a displayed countdown clock. If victims do not pay on time, they lose the
ability to pay and risk having their data permanently encrypted and rendered unusable. Perpetrators are
demanding a $300 to $700 payment sent to the perpetrator using various methods.



Child Pornography Scareware – This scareware is transmitted when computer users visit an infected
website. The victim’s computer locks up and displays a warning that the user has violated U.S. federal
law. Child pornography is either embedded in a banner image that appears on the victims’ screen or
revealed via an automatic browser redirecting them to a child pornography website. The scareware is used
as an extortion technique by threatening prosecution for visiting or viewing these images. The victim is
also informed that they have been recorded using audio, video and other devices. The only way to unlock
the computer is to pay the fine, usually between $300 and $5,000.



Citadel Ransomware – The Citadel ransomware, named Reveton, displays a warning on the victims’
computer purportedly from a law enforcement agency claiming that their computer had been used for
illegal activities, such as downloading copyrighted software or child pornography. To increase the
illusion they are being watched by law enforcement, the screen also displays the victim’s IP address and
some victims even report activity from their webcam. Victims are instructed to pay a fine to the U.S.
Department of Justice to unlock their computer. Many were told to pay the fines via prepaid cash
services such as Ucash or Paysafecard. In addition to installing the ransomware, the Citadel malware
continues to operate on the compromised computer to collect sensitive data that could potentially be
used to commit a variety of financial frauds.



Fake or Rogue Anti-Virus Software – In this scheme victims are scared into purchasing anti-virus
software that would allegedly remove viruses from their computers. A pop-up box appears that informs
users that their computers are full of viruses and need to be cleaned. The pop-up message has a button
victims can click to purchase anti-virus software that supposedly can immediately get rid of these viruses.
If the victims click the pop-up to purchase the anti-virus software, they are infected with malware. In
some instances, victims have been infected regardless of clicking on the pop-up box.

Real-Estate Rental Scams – Perpetrators search websites that list homes for sale and take information from
legitimate ads and post it with their own e-mail addresses on online advertising sites. The houses are usually listed
with below-market rental rates to immediately attract potential victims. Those interested contact the perpetrator
via e-mail. The perpetrator usually tells some story about having to leave the area quickly due to employment or
volunteer work. Many claim they left the United States for missionary or contract work in Africa. Victims are
usually instructed to send money overseas—enough to cover the first and last month’s rent—via a wire transfer
service. In some cases the perpetrators require potential renters to fill out credit applications so they can obtain
personal information, e.g., credit history, employment history, Social Security number and any number of other
crimes.

Grandparent Telephone Scams – Perpetrators target elderly individuals by claiming to be a grandson,
granddaughter, or other relative in desperate need of legal or financial assistance. Most schemes involve claims of
being arrested or in some type of accident. The callers create a sense of urgency and make desperate pleas for
money. The caller begs the grandparents not to tell the parents while often crying to help prevent the potential
victims from discovering the scam. Once potential victims appear to believe the caller, they are provided
instructions to wire money to an individual, often referred to as a bail bondsman, for their grandchild to be
released by law enforcement. Investigations have determined potential victims were identified via mass-produced
lead lists that target specific demographics. Perpetrators were identified using telephone numbers generated by
free apps to make the phone calls. This seems to be an added attempt to convince the grandparents the call is
legitimate (by displaying a recognizable number on the caller ID) and an attempt to mask the real telephone
number they are using to make it harder for law enforcement to investigate.
Timeshare Marketing Scams – Timeshare owners across the country are being scammed out of millions of dollars
by unscrupulous companies that promise to sell or rent their properties. In the typical scam, timeshare owners
receive unexpected telephone calls or e-mails from criminals posing as sales representatives for timeshare resale
companies. The representatives promise quick sales, often within 60 to 90 days. The sales representatives
frequently use high-pressure sales tactics to add a sense of urgency to the deal. Some victims have reported that
sales representatives pressured them by claiming they already had a buyer waiting, either on another line or even
in their office. Timeshare owners who agree to sell are told they are required to pay an up-front fee to cover

anything from listing and advertising fees to closing costs. These costs are usually paid via credit card and range
from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Once the fee is paid, timeshare owners report that the company becomes
evasive as calls go unanswered, numbers are disconnected and websites are inaccessible. In some cases, timeshare
owners who have been defrauded by a timeshare sales scheme have been subsequently contacted by an
unscrupulous timeshare fraud recovery company as well. The representative from the recovery company promises
assistance in recovering money lost in the sales scam. Some recovery companies require up-front fees as well for
services rendered. The IC3 has identified some instances in which people involved with the recovery company
also have a connection to the resale company, raising the possibility that timeshare owners are being scammed
twice by the same perpetrators.
Work-at-Home (Employment) Scams – Work-at-home scams continue to be very successful as more and more
people turn to the Internet to look for jobs. Poor economic conditions lead people in financial hardships to accept
any job they are offered. Although many work-at-home victims are unwitting in their participation in these scams,
others are witting participants. Regardless, these individuals can face criminal charges and, potentially,
prosecutions. Victims of work-at-home scams are often recruited by organized cyber criminals through
newspaper ads, online employment services, unsolicited e-mails or “spam,” and social networking websites.
Victims of work-at-home schemes become “mules” for cyber criminals who use their financial accounts to steal
and launder money.
Software Company Telephone Scams – Victims of these telephone scams began receiving calls from individuals
allegedly claiming to be from legitimate, well-known software companies. The victims are advised that malware
detected on their computer poses an impending threat. The fraudsters tried to instill a feeling of urgency so
victims would take immediate action and log in to their computers. Once the victims did so, the fraudsters
directed them to the utility area of the computers, where they appeared to demonstrate how the computers were
infected. The fraudsters offered to rid the computers of the malware for fees ranging from $49 to $450. When the
victims agreed to pay the fees, they were directed to a website where they entered a code or downloaded a
software program that allowed the fraudsters remote access to their computers.
Payday Loan Scams – In the payday loan scam or loan intimidation scam, the perpetrator relentlessly attempts to
contact victims via their home, cell and work phone numbers. Victims are told they are delinquent on a payday
loan and must repay the loan to avoid legal consequences. The caller fraudulently impersonates being a
representative of the FBI, Federal Legislative Department, law firms, or other legitimate-sounding agencies. They
claim to be collecting debts for companies such as United Cash Advance, U.S. Cash Advance, U.S. Cash Net, and
other Internet check-cashing services. They refuse to provide the victim with any details of the alleged payday
loans and often become abusive when questioned. The callers threaten victims with legal actions, arrests and, in
some cases, physical violence if they refuse to pay. In many cases, the callers even resort to harassment of
victims’ relatives, friends, and employers. What makes these schemes so successful is the perpetrator’s use of
accurate information about the victims, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, employer
information, bank account numbers, names and sometimes even telephone numbers of relatives and friends. How
the fraudsters obtain the personal information is unclear, but victims often relay that they had completed online
applications for other loans or credit cards before the calls began.
Loan Modification Scams – A loan modification scam often starts when a bogus loan company contacts a
distressed homeowner via phone, e-mail or mailing, and offers them a loan modification plan. In some cases the
victim may have initiated the contact by reaching out to these companies after seeing an advertisement. The loan
modification typically includes a lower interest rate, an extension in the length of the loan term, a change in the
type of loan or any combination of the three.
As a part of this scam, the company instructs the homeowner to cease all communication with lenders and stop
making mortgage payments until the loan modification process is complete. The homeowner is required to send
money to cover “processing fees” and “closing costs” for the new loan to be processed and approved. After the
homeowner sends the money, the loan modification company stops its communications with victims, leaving the
homeowner behind on actual mortgage payments and unable to recover funds sent to the bogus company.
Sextortion Scams – Perpetrators of these scams often initiate conversation via social media websites and/or online
dating websites. Once a rapport has been established, victims are asked to engage in video chats in which they are
manipulated to expose themselves in sexually compromising situations, while their images are secretly recorded.
2013 Internet Crime Report

12

Subjects then threaten to make the videos available to all the victims’ social networking friends and other online
contacts unless funds, ranging in the amounts of $50 to $300, are wired to various destinations.
Gun Sale Scams – Fraudsters begin this scam by enticing victims into purchasing firearms by advertising them
below market value. They post advertisements using photos and bogus descriptions lifted from legitimate firearm
ads. Most complaints reported to the IC3 involved the sale of rifles or long guns. The perpetrators normally ask
the victim to e-mail or fax them a copy of a photo ID to make the sale appear more legitimate. The scammers
seem to know gun transfer procedures because they obtain federal firearm license transfer information from the
victim and pretend to set up the transfer. The victim purchases the gun but never receives it. Victims have lost
hundreds to thousands of dollars with this scam to date.
Fraudulent Tech Support Call Scams – Perpetrators of these scams contact victims via phone and impersonate
tech support employees from various legitimate companies (e.g., Dell, Microsoft, Western Union, etc.). In some
cases the company name is displayed on the victims’ caller ID. The callers usually instruct the victims to get
online to visit specified web sites the scammers controls. Many ask victims to download files or run various
applications that either provide the caller with remote access to the victims’ computer or infect it with malware. If
remote access is established, the victims are instructed to open and log-in to various accounts to allow the caller to
update the system. The victims are then told to turn off their monitors to avoid interference with the update. The
victims later discover that the subjects have made wire transfers out of their accounts.
Photo and Mug Shot Scam – Scammers post photos or mug shots of individuals to extort money. Some victims
have reported they were juveniles at the time of the arrest and the information should be sealed, while others
complain the information is fakery or completely made up. Regardless, the photos and information are posted to
sites
such
as
www.bustedmugshots.com,
www.mugshots.com,
www.justmugshots.com,
or
www.unpublishmugshots.com. Complainants who request to have their mug shot removed must provide a copy of
their driver’s license, court record and other personal identifying information. This provides the perpetrator with
information they can use for a variety of other crimes. Other complainants have paid removal fees but
unfortunately never had their mug shots deleted. If they were removed, the mug shots appeared on similar
websites.
College and University Scams – The IC3 has identified two scams involving college or universities. In the first
scam the perpetrators register domains similar to domains owned by well-known colleges and universities. Once
similar domains are registered, they establish an e-mail address that appears to be from the purchasing department
of a legitimate institution. Using logos and information obtained from the home page of the legitimate school, the
fraudsters create fake purchase orders or requests for quotations and place orders with various merchants for items
such as routers, toner, or hard drives. The merchandise is shipped to various locations so that other scam
participants can re-package and re-ship items to overseas locations, usually Nigeria. The second scam involves
spear-phishing e-mails that are sent to university employees to dupe them into giving up their log-in credentials to
the schools’ websites. Once the fraudsters access the website, they can click on an online airline ticket booking
tool to purchase airline tickets with compromised credit cards or use credit cards already set up for that account.
Itinerary receipts are e-mailed to Yahoo!/Google/Hotmail accounts rather than the accounts with “.edu”
extensions.
SIM Card Swap Scam – Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) swap fraud occurs when an individual
compromises or steals the SIM card from a cell phone. This card can provide perpetrators with personal
identification, cell phone information (number, provider, etc.), and the ability to contact the carrier to request a
new SIM card. When the perpetrator receives and activates the new SIM card, the victim’s card is deactivated.
Victims may notice their phone will no longer transmit messages or calls. All alerts, payment confirmations, and
other various messages are then transmitted to the fraudster. SIM swapping is sometimes the second phase of the
scam. Initially, the perpetrator will send phishing emails to obtain credit card or bank account information. If the
perpetrator receives enough information, he/she can wipe out bank accounts, run up credit cards, and even open
new accounts or create fraudulent identification documents.
The scams above are just some of the Internet fraud schemes the IC3 received in 2013. This is by no means a
comprehensive list of Internet crimes, but it provides information on some of the most common schemes
criminals are using to defraud the public. A detailed list of common schemes is available at
http://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx. The IC3 also regularly posts fraud alerts detailing newly identified scams

reported to IC3 by law enforcement, industry and online complainants. These alerts are available at:
http://www.ic3.gov/media/default.aspx.

IC3 Case Highlights
Grand Theft: Polk County Florida Sheriff’s Office
The IC3 provided complaints to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office in December 2009. The monetary losses totaled
$15,114. In January 2010, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office advised the IC3 that its agency initiated an
investigation against Jack Loftin. The complainants advised they purchased concert tickets from the subject, but
never received them or a refund of their monies. Most of the victims established initial contact with the subject
through an eBay auction website. Many of the victims utilized PayPal as the medium for payment. An affidavit
released by the Office of the State Attorney, 10th Judicial Circuit stated the subject tricked people into thinking he
had VIP tickets for performers like Jimmy Buffet, Miley Cyrus or Aerosmith. The subject was charged with
pocketing $92,000 from victims across the country and not providing tickets or refunds. Loftin pleaded guilty to
24 counts of grand theft in November 2012 and was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment and ordered to pay
$87,000 in restitution on Jan. 18, 2013. He was also sentenced to 13 years probation during which time all
restitution to victims must be paid.

“Your agency provided crucial information that was utilized to locate the
victims exploited by Jack Loftin. Because of your assistance, our office was
able to have a successful prosecution which resulted in a state prison
sentence and an order of restitution to the victims in this case.”

Wire Fraud: United States Secret Service (USSS)
The IC3 has been working with USSS in Springfield, Ill., since March 2008 regarding a subject in a wire fraud
investigation. The subject, Chris Sours, advertised Internet-based businesses for sale, collected large sums of
money but did not provide legitimate websites to his customers. According to the USSS, victims have sent
amounts ranging from $2,000 to $45,000. The IC3 found related complaints from October 2005 to February 2012.
Total dollar loss from these complaints was $257,966. On November 13, 2012, Chris Sours was arrested, pled
guilty, and was indicted. On April 13, 2013, Chris Sours was sentenced to 60 months incarceration and ordered to
pay $343,233 in restitution in the Central District of Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois.
High Yield Investment Fraud: FBI, Southern District of Florida
The IC3 provided multiple complaints with a monetary loss of $390,889 to various FBI field offices in July 2007.
The complainants reported that Kerry Deevy and his co-conspirators fraudulently induced purchasers to buy into
fake business opportunities. Kerry Deevy and his co-conspirators purported to sell vending machines and greeting
card businesses, including assistance in establishing, maintaining and operating such businesses. The companies
were operating as Cards-R-Us, Premier Cards Inc., and Nation West. These business opportunities cost thousands
2013 Internet Crime Report

14

of dollars, and most victims paid at least $10,000 each. Kerry Deevy used various means to make it appear these
companies were located in the United States, including registering the corporations and renting office space to
make the scheme more authentic. In reality, the subject was operating from Costa Rica.
On April 11, 2013, the subject pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to 13
counts of an indictment, charging him with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud.
The subject was charged in connection with the operation of a series of fraudulent business opportunities after
being indicted in November 2012 by a federal grand jury. Following his arrest, the subject was extradited to the
United States for prosecution. The subject was sentenced to 60 months in prison and five years’ supervised
release on Aug. 13, 2013 and ordered to pay $4,541,914 in restitution.
Nigerian Romance Scam: Colorado Attorney General’s Office
Between March 2010 and October 2011, the IC3 received complaints from individuals who reported they were
defrauded via the Internet by Karen and Tracy Vasseur, a mother-daughter pair. The victims established
relationships with the subjects through online dating services and social networks. Often the subjects purported to
be overseas for military service. After trust had been built, the subjects began asking for funds to aid in
purchasing better cellular phones and technology. Funds were also supposedly being used for leave or military
time-off travel. Although funds were sent via MoneyGram and direct bank wires, the relationships were not
maintained as promised. Victims reported a combined monetary loss of $34,670.
The Colorado Attorney General’s Office opened a case in February 2012. Subsequent searches of the IC3
complaint database revealed an additional 126 complaints for a combined monetary loss of $130,673. It is
believed that Karen and Tracy Vasseur collected funds, kept a percentage, and then wired the remainder to
unknown Nigerian bosses. On Aug. 28, 2013, the subjects were sentenced for convictions stemming from a
“Nigerian Romance Scam.”
Counterfeit Check Scheme: Federal Law Enforcement
The IC3 received several hundred complaints related to a scheme in which law firms were the targets of a
counterfeit check scheme. The victims of the scam received e-mails that requested the law firms’ assistance for
debt collection. The victims received checks from the alleged debtor and were given instructions to wire the
collected funds minus attorney fees. In most cases, the funds were wired to banks in Korea, China, Ireland and
Canada. In all cases, the checks were returned as counterfeit. The IC3 first provided information to various field
offices and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) regarding this scheme in October 2008. The IC3 supported
many field offices with research and complaints as the scheme evolved.
In 2009, the IC3 obtained information that identified a major West African scammer in the Ontario area that has
been connected to the collection scam affecting law firms in the U.S. and Canada. As the IC3 obtained more
intelligence and conducted additional research, a nexus was established with FBI Birmingham, the USPIS, and
the U.S. Secret Service case against Emmanuel Ekhator, a Nigerian national. The IC3 supported Birmingham with
complaints, research, and produced public service announcements related to the subject’s fraudulent activity. In
2010, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania charged the subject for his crime and in
August 2011, he was extradited from Nigeria to the United States. The subject was ultimately sentenced in 2013
to 100 months in federal prison and a three-year term of supervised release for his role in a multi-national scheme
that deceived victims of more than $70 million and ordered to pay $11,092,028 in restitution and serve a threeyear term of supervised release following incarceration.

New Initiatives
In 2013, the FBI launched Operation Wellspring, an initiative by which the FBI, through the IC3, provides casespecific tactical intelligence and expert analysis to state and local law enforcement agencies engaged in
investigating Internet crime. Through Operation Wellspring, the IC3 sends targeted intelligence and fraud
packages to participating state, local and tribal law enforcement who successfully leverage FBI resources in
developing successful cases. Meanwhile, the participating law enforcement agencies reciprocate by providing the
IC3 with a continual flow of information and updates which, ultimately, will help other federal, state, and even
2013 Internet Crime Report

15

international law enforcement agencies realize success in developing effective investigations and prosecuting
perpetrators of Internet crime.
Based on this initiative, as of April 2014, the IC3 had referred out dozens of case referrals representing more than
900 victim complaints with total reported losses over $3.5 million. The FBI and Utah’s Cyber Task Force
successfully prosecuted two of these cases. The first case involved Darrell Cooper, who pled guilty to felony
theft, for stealing hundreds of DVDs from a grocery store rental kiosk and another case involving Shane Call,
who pled guilty to communications fraud for his involvement in selling counterfeit jerseys online.

Protecting the Public
The IC3 understands the importance of informing the public about the dangers of cybercrime. The IC3’s public
service announcements (PSAs) and scam alerts are posted online and distributed to law enforcement and various
media outlets. The PSAs keep consumers informed on the latest cyber trends and keep industry partners up-todate about Internet fraud. The scam alerts are based upon information from law enforcement and complaints
submitted to the IC3. These reports detail recent cybercrime trends and new twists to previously existing cyber
scams.
The IC3 maintains the website www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.com, an educational site developed by a joint federal
law enforcement and industry task force. This site gives consumers an opportunity to submit and review
testimonials. Testimonials include stories in which consumers were defrauded by a scam, or they did not fall
victim to a scam, and how they avoided becoming a victim. The PSAs, scam alerts and forms are all found on the
IC3’s website, www.ic3.gov.

Conclusion
This report details the IC3’s efforts to prevent and reduce the prevalence and impact of the crimes highlighted.
Throughout 2013, the IC3 has supported law enforcement officers in their investigations of Internet-related
crimes. In 2013, the IC3 processed 262,813 complaints, representing more than $781 million in losses. In
accordance with its mission, the IC3 referred complaints to state, local, federal, tribal and international law
enforcement agencies and interacted with these agencies’ personnel to support ongoing investigative initiatives
and to develop new ones as the cyber-crime landscape evolves. The IC3’s support led to numerous investigations
that resulted in arrests, seizures, convictions and restitution, among other actions. The IC3 also produced monthly
trend analysis reports, public service announcements, scam alerts, and other publications to alert law enforcement
and the general public about the pervasiveness of online crime. The IC3 continually reviews its services and
analytical tools to incorporate the latest advances in technology and ensure law enforcement needs are met.

Appendix I:
Online Crime Prevention
Every day the IC3 receives complaints from victims who clicked links in an e-mail or paid up-front fees for a
product or service only to be conned out of their hard-earned money. Based on the type of scam, there are a
number of things a consumer can do to avoid becoming a victim (information from

Phishing/Spoofing
•

Avoid filling out forms in e-mail messages that ask for personal information.

purports to be from a bank or credit card provider or the statements you receive.

Spam
•

Do not open spam. Delete it unread.

•

Never respond to spam as this will confirm to the sender that it is a “live” e-mail address.

Have a primary and secondary e-mail address: one for people you know and one for all other
purposes.

•

Avoid giving out your e-mail address unless you know how it will be used.

•

•

Do not accept packages you did not order.

•

If you receive packages you did not order, either refuse delivery or contact the company that
sent the package.

•

Be suspicious of any unsolicited e-mail requesting personal information.
