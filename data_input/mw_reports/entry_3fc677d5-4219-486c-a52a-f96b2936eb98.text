Confucius APT deploys Warzone RAT

Research by Abhijit Mohanta and Ashwin Vamshi
Uptycs' threat research team published a piece about Warzone RAT and its advanced
capabilities in November 2020. During the first week of January 2021, we discovered an
ongoing targeted attack campaign related to Confucius APT, a threat actor / group primarily
targeting government sectors in South Asia. This attack was identified by our in-house
osquery-based sandbox that triggered a detection on Warzone RAT activity.
Based on our threat intelligence systems, we were able to confirm that the threat actor is
trying to circumvent attacks with decoys that deliver the next stage payload via the template
injection technique and a short C2 TTL (Time to Live).

Technical analysis
Our in-house sandbox, which uses Uptycs EDR for detection, detected a Warzone RAT
payload in the attack kill chain of the decoy document “China Cruise Missiles CapabilitiesImplications for the Indian Army.docx” (hash:
b9b5a9fa0ad7f802899e82e103a6c2c699c09390b1a79ae2b357cacc68f1ca8e).
This attack document was crafted by the attacker group to entice the victims or targets into
opening a file related to the ongoing India China border tension.

Army.docx" decoy.
We believe the decoy lure must have been copied from this PDF, which contains a study by
Kartik Bommakanti for the Observer Research Foundation (ORF).

Attack kill chain
The decoy lure was a 16-page document that would have skipped the eye of static heuristic
engines because they generally scan suspicious files based on the number of pages
(malicious documents are usually one page).
Upon execution, the document used template injection to download the next stage RTF
exploit that downloaded the final stage Warzone payload using a DLL embedded in the RTF
exploit. The attack kill chain of the different phases of the attack is detailed in figure 2, below.

Figure 2: Attack kill chain of the different phases of the attack.
The various phases of the attack are as follows:
Victim opens the Word document
Document downloads template RTF
Exploit in RTF is triggered and bing.dll is dropped and executed
Bing.dll downloads Warzone RAT
Using the template injection technique, the next stage payload is downloaded via the
word/_rels/settings.xml.rels file present in the document structure as shown in figure 3,
below.

The downloaded template (hash:

file containing exploit code for the old vulnerability “CVE-2018-0802” in the Microsoft
3/9

equation editor (EQNEDT32.exe). This is evident from the CLSID present in the RTF file
“7b0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046,” which is related to the equation editor. The
RTF contains a DLL embedded in an OLE object as shown in figure 4, below.

The embedded DLL file, bing.dll (SHA-256:
07277c9f33d0ae873c2be3742669594acc18c7aa93ecadb8b2ce9b870baceb2f), which is
executed upon successful exploitation, contains an export “mark” that is responsible for
downloading the Warzone payload. Figure 5, below, shows the code that downloads the
Warzone payload.

The Warzone payload is saved to the %ProgramData% folder as update.exe (SHA-256:
4500851dad1ac87165fc938fe5034983c10423f800bbc2661741f39e43ab8c8d) as shown in
the above figure. In order to maintain persistence, an LNK file named update.lnk pointing to
update.exe is dropped to startup folders - “%AppData%Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup”.
Warzone RAT was caught by Uptycs in November. It has capabilities to log keystrokes, steal
passwords, capture the webcam, and it has the ability to bypass UAC on Windows 10. You
can read more details about Warzone RAT in our blog post.

Similar themed attacks delivering Warzone RAT
We identified three similar DLL files in our threat intelligence systems with the same
imphash: 58f8f4bdb6d7059247f4fe90a8ba9477. Using this data, we identified three more
decoy documents most likely used for different targets using these DLL files as the next
stage payloads.
The first decoy document was observed in October 2020.
File name: Testing.docx
Hash: a3cd781b14d75de94e5263ce37a572cdf5fe5013ec85ff8daeee3783ff95b073
RTF hash:
686847b331ace1b93b48528ba50507cbf0f9b59aef5b5f539a7d6f2246135424
DLL hash: 1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126
PDB path: C:\Users\admin\Documents\dll\linknew\Release\linknew.pdb
C2: recent[.]wordupdate[.]com
The decoy’s subject focused on China preparing for war in the Taiwan Strait—a topic sure to
attract attention

The second decoy was observed in November 2020. Interestingly, this decoy had the same
hash of the next stage RTF and the DLL payloads used in the first decoy document.
File name: Suparco Vacancy Notification.docx
Hash: 59ccfff73bdb8567e7673a57b73f86fc082b0e4eeaa3faf7e92875c35bf4f62c
RTF hash:

DLL hash: 1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126
PDB path: C:\Users\admin\Documents\dll\linknew\Release\linknew.pdb
C2: recent[.]wordupdate.com
This decoy posed as a job application form for the Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere
Research Commission (SUPARCO).

Also in November 2020, we identified another highly targeted decoy:
Hash: 59cd62ad204e536b178db3e2ea10b36c782be4aa4849c10eef8484433a524297
RTF hash: 3ce48f371129a086935b031333387ea73282bda5f22ff78c85ee7f0f5e4625fe
DLL hash: ea52d6358d53fc79e1ab61f64cb77bb47f773f0aa29223b115811e2f339e85f5
PDB path: C:\Users\admin\Documents\dll\linknew\Release\linknew.pdb
C2: recent.wordupdate.com
This decoy focused on another attention-grabbing topic—what to expect from Joe Biden, the
new president of the United States, related to top nuclear weapons issues. The DLL file
connected to the same C2 and contained the same PDB path in the above two documents.

Based on the decoys and the topics, we believe the campaign is ongoing with selected
targets. As the C2 TTL is short lived, we believe the threat actor is tailoring the attacks to
selected targets and taking down their attack elements.
Targeted attacks will always try to leverage the latest news with high media attention to tailor
attacks. The Warzone RAT was deployed as the final stage payload to monitor and carry
surveillance on the victim's machine. While traditional solutions have a detection stance
against such threats, it is always recommended to have a layered security approach that has
advanced analytics and granular visibility of targeted attacks and the next stage payloads
used in their attack kill chains.
