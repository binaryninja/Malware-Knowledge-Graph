Introduction
In our previous research we investigated a ransom cartel, and then we conducted a study
on ransomware gangs and their links to Russian intelligence organizations. Now, we are
conducting a use case into one of the world’s most notorious ransomware gangs, REvil. This
particular case is fascinating because the gang has existed for several years, conducted
many high-profile attacks, inspired several spin-off gangs, and in the end, caused major
turmoil among partnering hackers who supported them. While many researchers and
media organizations have produced reports on REvil, most of the accounts detail specific
attacks, telling only part of REvil’s story. The purpose of this white paper is to provide a
“big picture” assessment of the REvil crime organization by presenting a “cradle to grave”
evaluation of actors behind it and their operations over time. Additionally, there are
lessons we can learn from a criminal organization that, for the most part, had success
where others failed. Overall, we think REvil presents an opportunity for analysts and
defenders to learn from.

Goals
Analyst1 conducted research to address the following goals:
1. Show an inside view of REvil, their affiliates, and the “human” side of their operation
through their own words and actions within the underground criminal community.
2. Profile REvil, their significant events, and the impact each event caused.
3. Identify REvil affiliates and detail how they integrate and operate within ransomware
operations.
4. Identify areas of success and failure which eventually led to REvil’s demise and how it
impacted the ransomware community.

Executive Overview
The REvil gang is an organized criminal enterprise based primarily out of Russia that runs
a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation. The core members of the gang reside and
operate out of Russia. REvil leverages hackers for hire, known as affiliates, to conduct
the breach, steal victim data, delete backups, and infect victim systems with ransomware
for a share of the profits. Affiliates primarily stem across eastern Europe, though a small
percentage operate outside that region. In return, the core gang maintains and provides
the ransomware payload, hosts the victim data leak/auction site, facilitates victim
communication and payment services, and distributes the decryption key. In simpler
terms, the core gang are the service provider and persona behind the operation, while
the affiliates are the hired muscle facilitating attacks.
REvil is known for its high-profile attacks. The attacks range from Grubman Shire Meiselas
& Sacks, an entertainment law firm associated with many celebrities and political figures,
from then-President Donald Trump to Kaseya, a Managed Service Provider which REvil
leveraged to compromise nearly 1,500 companies, among many others.1 These are only
two of many high-profile victims attacked by REvil over the lifetime of their activity. Like
many ransomware attackers, in addition to encrypting their target’s data, REvil often
stole and copied victim data to further extort the target. If the victim refused to pay, REvil
leaked or sold their data to other criminals.
Nevertheless, while it is clear REvil savored the spotlight, their greed led to their downfall.
In July of 2021, as a direct result of the Kaseya attack, the United States government
began taking action against REvil. REvil’s actions eventually led to discussions between
two of the most powerful leaders in the world, resulting in US federal indictments and
arrests of REvil members by Russian authorities. Yet the most significant cause leading
to REvil’s downfall resulted from their own actions when they betrayed the criminal
community which supported them.
In the rest of this white paper, we detail REvil’s origin story, significant events, and the
dramatic twists and turns from one of the most interesting criminal stories we have seen
to date. Then, we provide a detailed assessment showing the impact to the ransomware
community after both the US and Russian governments acted against REvil.
Based on the analysis and research presented in this white paper, we have two significant
findings which affect the ransomware community:

4

1. The United States will likely never prosecute REvil or other Russian-based ransomware
criminals in their own court of law. However, US actions have psychologically impacted
the Russian ransomware community and directly affected their criminal operations.
2. Ransomware groups are changing their day-to-day operating procedures and have
new significant concerns about their operational security due to recent interference
of government and law enforcement agencies. Analyst1 identified evidence
demonstrating recent actions against the REvil crime ring that caused distrust and
paranoia, directly affecting key players in the ransomware community.

The Prequel:
REvil’s Origin
Story

The Prequel: REvil’s Origin Story
One aspect of REvil we found interesting is the group’s availability to both media and
security researchers. The gang built its brand on its name and used it as a persona to
conduct interviews and release statements publicly. For example, Tomas Meskauskas,
a security researcher from PCrisk, first communicated with the attacker through their
own chat portal on May 1, 2019, when the gang first started.2 Meskauskas captured their
conversation in his blog, describing his interactions with the attacker. In the conversation,
Meskauskas asked their name and told the adversary they were being called Sodinokibi
by security researchers.3 Interestingly, REvil was unaware and asked him to point out
where this information came from, which Meskauskas did. REvil was at a loss as they did
not have a name at the time but did not like Sodinokibi and told him to give them a few
days and they would come up with a name. This event initiated the attacker to brand
themselves “REvil.” Below is the screenshot provided by PCrisk and Tomas Meskauskas
displaying his conversation with REvil:

Figure 1: Chat between REvil operator and Tomas Meskauskas as posted on the PCrisk blog4
7

Later, in October 2020, we learned more about the meaning of the name REvil when one
of the group’s operators took part in an interview in which they discussed their origin and
aspects of their attacks.5 In the interview,6 the REvil operator stated the gang’s name is a
combination of the terms “Ransom” and “Evil” (REvil) and was inspired by “Resident Evil,”
a popular video game.7
However, the story behind the gang’s name is interesting because before its operations
started in April 2019, the individuals behind REvil began their criminal careers under
another ransomware operation. It was this early activity where the gang gained
experience in conducting ransomware attacks. The men who ran the operation named
both their gang and their ransomware payload “GandCrab.” Initially, GandCrab conducted
their own attacks. However, the gang evolved, and similar to REvil, GandCrab began
relying on affiliates to assist in their attacks.
GandCrab ransomware operations took place from January 2018 until June 20198 when
they allegedly retired and shut down the RaaS program. Figure 2 below shows Gand
Crab’s retirement message posted to an underground forum.

Figure 2: GandCrab retirement statement (translated from Russian) posted on 31 May 20199

At the time, we had no real insight into the actual people behind GandCrab. When the gang
retired in 2019, REvil emerged. Due to this and other associations, we initially believed
the individuals behind the GandCrab gang simply rebranded as REvil. We believed this
for several reasons.

8

First, the REvil payload shares similar development techniques and functionality with
GandCrab ransomware. For example, both ransomware variants share the same string
decoding functionality. The cybersecurity firm Secureworks noted the similarity and
used the code to “fingerprint” the REvil payload.10 Using this “fingerprint,” they created
a signature and explored malware repositories
to identify other samples in the wild. Due to the

GandCrab.

Second, the Sodinokibi payload used a similar method/
function as GandCrab to facilitate the affiliate ID and sub-ID, which map the individual
payload to the affiliate and its corresponding campaign.11 Third, in the first version of REvil
ransomware, a debug path, “D:\\gc6\\core\\src\\common\\debug.c”, exists. Note that the
path includes the characters “gc6.” GandCrab produced several updates/versions to their
ransomware over its lifespan. The last iteration was GandCrab version 5 (GC5), leading
researchers to speculate Sodinokibi is the next generation of GandCrab ransomware,
version 6.12, 13
Further, most GandCrab affiliates transitioned to the REvil operation, dispersing the
REvil payload on victim systems once GandCrab exited, further supporting the link
between the two gangs. For these reasons, we believed the entity behind REvil were
the same individuals behind GandCrab. Instead, based on information provided in both
REvil interviews and supporting evidence found in a US indictment, it appears we got this
partially wrong.
Based on the earlier interview with a REvil operator, the individuals behind it were
actually affiliates of the GandCrab gang and not the core gang itself. According to a REvil
operator, when GandCrab retired, the affiliate, which evolved into REvil, approached
the GandCrab gang and purchased its ransomware source code.14 It is not clear if REvil
purchased GandCrab v5 source code and used it to develop Sodinokibi or if GandCrab
created it and sold it to the REvil gang.
Either way, someone repurposed, modified, and developed it, or parts of it, into the
Sodinokibi Ransomware payload. It’s important to note that Sodinokibi and GandCrab
ransomware are not the same source code. Still, they appear to share the same developer
and use some of the same code logic to achieve similar functionality, as we discussed in
the earlier example. REvil used this new (at the time) payload, Sodinokibi, throughout
their operation.

9

We questioned REvil’s claims surrounding their origin. It’s possible REvil rebranded
themselves from GandCrab and lied about their history. However, the REvil operator
admits to conducting illegal ransomware and hacking activities supporting the GandCrab
gang. To us, it seems illogical for REvil to lie about their affiliation to GandCrab yet admit
to conducting the crimes behind its operation. For these reasons, we believe REvil’s
affiliation claim is likely accurate. If REvil operators are GandCrab affiliates and not its
core members as initially thought, the obvious question is who was behind GandCrab.
While this question is outside the scope of this white paper, it has never been answered.
On April 25, 2019, over a month before GandCrab’s retirement, REvil conducted its
first of many attacks. In the early attack, REvil took advantage of a zero-day, exploiting
a vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server.15, 16 After initial access, REvil enumerated the
environment, identified domain controllers, and staged their payload in an attempt to infect
the victim and encrypt their data. However, interestingly, in this first attack, REvil used
both their new Sodinokibi payload and GandCrab ransomware on systems throughout
the target environment. We don’t know why the attacker used both payloads, but the
time frame and access to both ransomware variants further support the relationship
between the two gangs.

Affiliate Recruitment
For a RaaS program to succeed, there must be a solid provider to support operations and
even stronger affiliates to compromise targets efficiently. If either is weak or inefficient,
so will the rest of the operation. For example, if you have a strong affiliate program that
is exceptional at compromising victims, but the provider cannot negotiate with victims or
launder the proceeds, the program will fail. Since REvil themselves began as an affiliate,
they knew they needed to recruit the most qualified hacker teams to breach targets. To
do so, REvil began posting recruitment ads to the same underground forums in which
GandCrab previously participated.
REvil needed experienced affiliates and wanted to ensure the affiliates who supported
GandCrab moved to their program. To demonstrate they were a serious RaaS provider
and show affiliates there was money to be made, REvil first deposited $130,000 worth
of bitcoin across two underground forums where they conducted recruiting.17 Money
deposited to the forum can be used to purchase malware and services. REvil claimed to
pay up to 70% of the profit earned from victim ransom payments in their recruiting posts.
Initially, REvil only sought to partner with five affiliates:

10

“Five affiliates more can join the program, and then we’ll go under the radar. Each
affiliate is guaranteed USD 10,000. Your cut is 60 percent at the beginning, and
70 percent after the first three payments are made. Five affiliates are guaranteed
[$]50,000 in total. We have been working for several years, specifically five years in
this field. We are interested in professionals.” — REvil
REvil also refused to work with mediocre hackers still learning their trade and considered
only sophisticated and proven affiliates. Additionally, candidates for the affiliate program
had to be native Russian speakers.
Note: Similar to other Russian-based ransomware attackers, REvil prohibits its
affiliates from attacking countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), which formerly made up the Soviet Union. REvil also configured the Sodinokibi
ransomware to check systems for languages used in CIS-based countries. If the
ransomware detects a CIS language used on the target system, the payload will
not execute.
Further, to filter out law enforcement and researchers posing as candidates, REvil would
ask questions based on local traditions or myths they believed could be known only to
Russian and Ukrainian nationals.18 To facilitate candidate interviews, REvil used qTox, an
encrypted peer-to-peer chat, voice, and video communications client that functions over
the Tor network.19 Interviews involve the candidate and multiple REvil operators who
communicate in the chat session. Candidates are interviewed and, if accepted, placed on
an affiliate team comprised of four to five team members. The affiliate percentage of the
profit, allegedly 70%, must be divided and shared among the members of the affiliate team.

Part I: REvil Awakens
By June 2019, GandCrab closed down its RaaS program, released a decryptor key, and
went dark. REvil and their affiliates quickly filled the gap left by GandCrab’s departure.
However, REvil added a new component to their attack playbook. In addition to encrypting
victim data, REvil began stealing it as a second method to extort its target further. Now, if
the victim chooses not to pay, REvil threatens to release or sell the victim’s data to other
criminals. REvil was the first gang to use this tactic in attacks. REvil used the data as a
double extortion tactic to demand higher ransom amounts from the victim. Today, most
ransomware attackers have adopted this technique.
Once REvil affiliates complete the attack phase, the victim’s data is encrypted, and a
ransom note, such as the one shown in Figure 3, is presented to the victim.

Figure 3: REvil ransom note dropped by the Sodinokibi payload

The victim then uses the key included in the ransom note, which is specific to their
organization, to log in to REvil’s chat/support portal and data leak site, displayed in Figures
4 and 5:
13

Figure 4: REvil Chat Support used to communicate and negotiate with victims

Figure 5: REvil’s “Happy Blog” data leak website

Additionally, each entry provided has its own countdown timer. REvil gives the victim
a limited time frame to pay the ransom. During this time, REvil begins posting a small
percentage of the data onto their leak/auction site with a brief description of each data
archive that anyone can download and access.

Figure 6: Countdown timer indicating how long a victim has to pay the ransom

14

The longer it takes a victim to pay, the more of their data is exposed. If the victim refuses
to pay and time runs out, REvil auctions their data to the highest criminal bidder. While
the purpose of the leak site is to entice the victim to pay, essentially, it is an online auction,
and if the victim does not pay for their data, someone else, a criminal, usually will.

REvil Operations 2019
With REvil, it’s all about the money, and they will use various methods to generate income
from a target or its data. For example, a unique tactic seen in REvil’s early operations
involved Point of Sale (PoS) systems. In addition to their normal ransom activities, REvil
attempts to compromise PoS terminals and steal sensitive data, such as credit card
information.20 This tactic is primarily used when the victim is in the retail industry.
In REvil’s first few months of operations, a managed service provider (MSP) became one
of REvil’s initial victims between June and July 2019. Interestingly, GandCrab conducted
a similar attack on another MSP only four months prior, in February 2019. Perhaps, as a
former GandCrab affiliate, REvil knew an MSP would be a lucrative target. MSPs support
and can access their customer’s environments, which is likely why REvil chose them as a
target.21 REvil leveraged this access, compromised the MSP’s downstream customers, and
used TrickBot malware to spread and infect them with Sodinokibi ransomware. In total,

gangs.
Note: While researching the attacks, we realized REvil and GandCrab compromised
three major US MSPs and their customers between February 2019 and July 2021.
We will discuss the 2021 MSP breach further in this report. Yet, MSPs continued to
be targeted by ransomware attackers, as did their customers. To be fair, some of the
compromised downstream MSP customers could have protected themselves if they
had patched their software with updates offered by the MSP provider. Based on this
historical reoccurring pattern of attacks on MSPs, we believe they will likely continue
to be targeted by ransomware gangs looking for an easy target with deep pockets to
pay out their ransom.

In late August 2019, REvil affiliates conducted reconnaissance on one of the largest banks
in Chile, BancoEstado, identifying public and private email addresses used by employees
for day-to-day business purposes. REvil crafted phishing emails using the target list that
instructed the bank’s employee to open a weaponized office document. However, the
document silently installs a backdoor on the bank system once opened. Fortunately
for the bank, the initial breach provided REvil with access to only the bank’s corporate
network used to facilitate day-to-day business, not the operational network used to
facilitate financial transactions.
Once in the environment, REvil enumerated the bank’s network and identified highvalue systems such as domain controllers and file servers. Next, REvil used publicly
available hacktools, such as Mimikatz, to steal passwords from privileged users. With
administrative privileges, REvil invoked Vssadmin to delete shadow copies necessary
to restore data and executed scripts that disabled various security products that might
identify their ransomware payload.
In the early hours of Saturday, September 6, 2019, with
the environment primed for the attack, REvil used PsExec,

the bank’s corporate data useless. When employees came into
work a few hours later, they found their files encrypted and a
ransom note displaying instructions to contact REvil and arrange payment in exchange
for the decryption key. The bank had no choice but to close operations while dealing with
the breach. Analsyt1 could not confirm if REvil stole bank data in addition to encrypting
it; however, based on previous attacks, we believe it is likely. It is also worth noting that,
based on attack data analyzed, a pattern exists in which REvil often conducts the ransom
execution phase of their attacks on weekend evenings when most organizations are
closed, similar to the BancoEstado incident.
While not the only method, up to this point, the attacker primarily relied on phishing
emails to infect targets. However, shortly after the BancoEstado breach, REvil altered its
tactics for the initial breach and increased its use of “for sale” malware known as the RIG
exploit kit. RIG’s attack chain primarily relies on “drive-by” infections, delivered through a
malvertizing campaign in which a victim’s browser gets redirected to a website implanted
with the Exploit kit’s malicious code.25
While drive-by infections are the most popular with exploit kits, it is not the only method
effective at compromising targets. REvil used both drive-by attacks and phishing emails

16

in their attacks involving the exploit kit. REvil likely chose RIG due to its ability to provide
various exploits, effective against many software vulnerabilities, increasing the likelihood
of a successful infection. When a potential victim browses to a REvil-hosted malicious
website, RIG provides an à-la-carte variety of exploit options, which the attacker relies
on to identify and compromise a vulnerability in the target’s system, such as unpatched
software. If successful, RIG then installs a backdoor or other malware used to further the
attack and provide REvil access to the target’s system and environment.
REvil used the RIG exploit kit as early as June but still relied more on spam campaigns and
other infection vectors. That, in addition to REvil’s targeting, changed in November 2019.
At that time, REvil began to use RIG to target Asia-based organizations heavily.26 In the
campaign, targeted organizations spanned several Asian countries, including Malaysia,
Vietnam, and Korea.27 REvil’s most prevalent use of RIG was to exploit the victim and
run code that downloads a malicious VBScript, giving the attacker the ability to install
backdoors as well as their Sodinokibi payload.
On December 4, 2019, REvil compromised CyrusOne,28 a

managed service customers, including financial and brokerage
firms. At the time, CyrusOne stated they did not intend to pay
the ransom. CyrusOne knew they could be a target for ransomware attacks as a data
center provider. The company listed ransomware as one of its biggest risks in an annual
report to the Securities and Exchange Commission about a year before the attack.31
Admirably, CyrusOne claims they would not and did not pay the ransom. Fortunately, it
appears the organization still had backups of their data, allowing them to restore their
environment and assist customers affected by the attack. However, that only addresses
the data REvil encrypted, not what they stole. It is unclear if REvil auctioned off the stolen
data as they typically do when a victim does not pay. Additionally, CyrusOne stated they
worked with law enforcement and cooperated with the investigation.
Like the June 2019 attack against an MSP, in this attack, REvil continued to show its
targeting choices involve supply chain organizations. From an attacker’s perspective, this
makes sense. They breach one organization and gain access to its downstream customers,
who trust the initial target, further maximizing their opportunity to generate ransombased revenue.

New Year is one of Russia’s most celebrated holidays. Russians officially celebrate for
ten days between December 30 and January 8. However, while the rest of the world
celebrated New Year’s Eve on December 31, 2019, REvil was hard at work to compromise
Travelex, a foreign currency exchange, which at the time was REvil’s most significant target.
While REvil conducted the ransomware execution phase of their attack on December 31,
the earlier stages of the attack began much earlier.
BBC, a news and media organization reporting on the story, reached out to REvil on the
gang’s chat support page.32 Surprisingly, REvil responded to their questions. According
to REvil, the attack began six months prior, in June 2019. Most enterprise ransomware
attacks range from three to twenty-one days. It’s doubtful an attacker would risk getting
caught by sitting in a target environment for six months. Regardless of the time frame,
REvil not only encrypted Travelex data, but it also claimed to have stolen a database
containing Personal Identifiable Information (PII) on Travelex customers, such as names,
dates of birth, and credit card numbers.

Travelex

(GDPR). Making matters worse, Travelex outright lied to both
their customers and business partners who relied on their services, claiming the outage
was due to “planned maintenance.” Travelex likely did not count on REvil posting messages
and data related to the attack on its data leak site, let alone speaking to reporters. Further,
due to the global outage of services, Travelex asked customers to go into branches in
person where “pen and paper” transactions took place. Obviously, this response could
not scale Travelex’s global operations, making it clear REvil’s claims were true.
Ironically, Travelex could and should have easily avoided the entire incident. According
to Travelex revenue reporting, the company reported nearly a billion dollars in revenue
in 2018, a year before the ransomware incident. Despite its deep pockets, Travelex
cut corners and did not secure its infrastructure, making the initial breach extremely
easy. REvil gained initial access and administrative privileges into Travelex systems by
taking advantage of a vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510) in the company’s VPN software.
Ironically, Pulse Secure, the VPN software provider, patched the vulnerability in April
2019, eight months prior to the breach.33, 34 If Travelex simply applied the patch to its
Pulse Secure VPN servers, REvil could not have exploited it. This vulnerability received a
lot of media attention since it required little technical expertise to render the exploit and
the extremely high level of risk associated with the vulnerability. Unfortunately, much like
18

their response to the breach, Travelex handled their security and vulnerability patching
very poorly.
At the time, Travelex was not only REvil’s most prominent target, but it was also their most
lucrative endeavor. REvil demanded a ransom of $6 million worth of bitcoin in exchange
for the decryption key and a promise to delete and not sell their customers’ data (fingers
crossed). In the end, Travelex made a $2.3 million ransom payout to REvil. Unfortunately,
Travelex never truly recovered from this attack. Due to the breach, Travelex shut down
business operations to include its websites, used by their customers, in over 30 countries
globally. By August 2021, the firm ceased operations in the United States and was forced
into Bankruptcy.35

REvil Operations 2020
Since the beginning, REvil has continuously made headlines with its attacks. However, REvil
became known far outside the cybersecurity community when they took down Travelex.
A little over a month after the Travelex attack, in February 2020, REvil compromised and
extorted the clothing manufacturer and designer, Kenneth Cole Productions.36 Then,
in May 2020, REvil compromised Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks, a New York-based
entertainment law firm. A law firm may not seem as notable as Travelex or Kenneth Cole.
However, this particular firm had well-known political and celebrity clients. REvil stole
756GB of sensitive data pertaining to various legal contracts and negotiations involving
celebrity clients which the firm represented.37
Making the situation worse, the firm’s high-profile clients were at risk of blackmail, in
addition to the $21 million ransom demand between REvil and Grubman Shire Meiselas
& Sacks directly. In an attempt to apply pressure, REvil began to leak the firm’s data on
their data leak (auction) site.

Figure 7: REvil’s auction of Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks on their data leak/auction site
19

The initial data leak included confidential legal information and contracts for celebrity
clients such as Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Christina Aguilera. When the firm still refused
to pay, REvil doubled the ransom, now demanding a $42 million ransom payment.38
Additionally, according to a post from a known REvil persona on a Russian-speaking
underground forum, if not paid, REvil would release data on then-President Donald
Trump:

“There’s an election race going on, and we found a ton of dirty laundry. Mr. Trump,
if you want to stay president, poke a sharp stick at the guys; otherwise, you may
forget this ambition forever, and to you voters, we can let you know that after such
a publication, you certainly don’t want to see him as president. Well, let’s leave out
the details. The deadline is one week.” — REvil
Now, you have to remember, while REvil had sensitive data between the law firm and
their clients, that does not mean the information was actually as damaging as they
claimed. For example, while sensitive, the celebrity data leaked was far from damaging
or embarrassing, as the gang suggested. Instead, they were simply contracts with various
entertainment and concert venues. More importantly, President Trump’s representatives
stated the President was not a client of the law firm. Taking a page from their home
countries’ government tactics, REvil may have taken valid stolen data and put a spin on
it to make it appear far more damaging than it was. While REvil can hack some of the
world’s most prestigious organizations, it failed to post 1GB of data containing a trove of
documents related to the firm’s celebrity clients. REvil tried to post the data to a publicly
available file upload service to make it more accessible to the average Joe. However, the
provider immediately terminated their account and disabled the download, making REvil
look foolish.
To try and save face, REvil posted 169 emails associated with or involving businesses
surrounding President Trump.39 However, the emails were meaningless and did not
provide “dirt” on President Trump. Instead, the effort showed REvil for what they are,
lying criminals that steal and extort legitimate individuals and businesses.
In the end, REvil continued to release data until their auction countdown ran out. Taking
advantage of the media attention this attack drew, REvil made a spectacle of selling
the data to the first criminal willing to pay the $1.5 million price tag. However, to their
embarrassment, no one bought the data when the auction ended, once again leaving
REvil to look silly. This embarrassment is important to note, as REvil began to significantly
target larger, more noteworthy targets after this attack in a likely effort to reclaim their
credibility after such a public failure.

20

Following the failed extortion attempt against the US law firm, REvil conducted attacks
against a major ISP in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), and the largest telecom in
Argentina, Telecom Argentina, between May and June 2020. The attack in Sri Lanka
failed, leaving only a small subsection of the company’s infrastructure exposed to REvil,
who tried to deploy Sodinokibi throughout their environment. Fortunately, the Sri Lanka
telecom identified actors in their network and mitigated the threat before REvil could
complete the attack, and neither operating services nor customer data were affected.40
Telecom Argentina, however, was not as lucky. REvil attackers gained administrative
privileges early in the attack and quickly stole and encrypted data on almost
18,000 systems within the provider’s infrastructure.41 Still, REvil failed to affect customer
services such as internet connectivity in this attack. Instead, systems and data relating
to the ISP’s call center took the most damage. REvil demanded Telecom Argentina pay
$7.5 million to restore systems and prevent stolen data from being sold at their criminal
auction. Showing their greed, REvil threatened to double the price to $15 million if
not paid within three days. The telecom claims they did not pay the ransom. Since no
customer-facing operational services were affected, and business continued as usual,
it seems likely they did not. Additionally, REvil did not remove the telecom from their
auction site, indicating the ransom was never paid. Despite their initial success, this was
another example of a string of failures in which REvil put in the time and effort to reach a
target but failed to generate income for their actions.
Note: We are calling out a string of failed ransom attempts by REvil. However,
there are other breaches during this time that did result in a ransom payment.
Nevertheless, the string of very public failed attempts involving high-profile targets
likely embarrassed REvil and demonstrated a trend that we believe led REvil to invest
in themselves and further develop their operation.

Part II: REvil Advances
Several months after the public embarrassment of REvil’s failed attempt to extort
celebrities, the US president, and several global telecom/ISPs, REvil made a significant
move to improve their operation. On September 27, 2020, REvil reinitiated its efforts
to recruit the best ransomware affiliates. In an effort to draw affiliates away from
other RaaS providers, REvil deposited 99 bitcoins, valuing $1 million at the time, to an
underground hacker forum, demonstrating there was money to be made with their
partnership.42 The public embarrassment and failure to monetize the data stolen from
Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks likely contributed to REvil’s increased effort to grow
their operational efficiency. As a result, REvil hired more skilled hacker affiliates and
initiated new campaigns against even bigger targets. Figure 8 shows REvil’s recruitment
ad posted to an underground Russian-speaking forum:

Figure 8: Ransom-based recruitment ad (translated from Russian)

A second recruitment ad showed REvil was looking for a negotiator and a “tier 1 network
provider.” From the post, you can see some of the differences in skill sets desired compared
to earlier efforts discussed. For example, the negotiator must speak English, which is likely
due to the high number of US targets and the ability/experience in communicating with
media, recovery, and insurance companies — all of which could play a role in negotiating
ransom payments. We found it interesting that REvil sought individuals who could use
“VoIP technology with voice scrambling” to conduct negotiations “both in text and
verbally.” This is interesting since we are unaware of an incident in which REvil conducted
negotiations over the phone and have only observed negotiations through the gang’s chat
portal hosted on their infrastructure or by email.
Furthermore, note that REvil calls out targets in the government sector and defense
systems. Again, in the tier 1 network provider role, REvil seeks candidates who have
experience exploiting technologies such as Citrix, SolarWinds, and BlueGate, which are
23

all critical technologies seen compromised in ransomware attacks. The recruitment post
can be seen below in Figure 9:

Figure 9: REvil recruitment ad (translated from Russian)

As mentioned earlier, REvil enjoys the spotlight and has conducted interviews over the
lifespan of its operations. Before October 2020, REvil’s communications took place on their
chat portal, email between themselves and select reporters, and posts to underground
forums. In October, that changed when YouTube channel Russian OSINT conducted a
lengthy interview with one of REvil’s core operators.43 The interview is in Russian, but
researcher @Sapphirex00 translated and posted an English version here. The interview
provided insight into REvil’s mindset and details about their origin. The interview revealed
interesting information. For example, REvil claimed it makes $100 million annually and
relies on ten developers internally to maintain and upgrade the Sodinokibi payload.44
As discussed earlier, REvil disclosed their background prior to becoming REvil and the
significance of their name, among other interesting details.
A few weeks later, on November 16, 2020, REvil attacked Managed.com, a websitehosting provider. The attack resulted in both service downtime and likely a loss in
customers who could not risk having their websites offline. After the attack, the websitehosting provider took down their entire hosting infrastructure globally to prevent further
damage. In the end, REvil demanded a 500K ransom that would double if not paid before
the auction timer on REvil’s data leak site expired. Again, note REvil’s trend in attacking
organizations with relationships and access to many other organizations through their
services and infrastructure.45
24

While not a ransomware attack, another significant event took place in November
when REvil purchased the source code for KPOT 2.0, an information-stealing malware
variant. KPOT is used to steal usernames and passwords from “web browsers, instant
messengers, email clients, VPNs, RDP services, FTP apps, cryptocurrency wallets, and
gaming software.46, 47 REvil purchased KPOT for $6,500 from its author who was moving
on to other projects. Its developer decided to sell KPOT on an auction on a dark web
forum. REvil purchased the malware to add to its toolbox to leverage in attacks against its
targets. It’s unclear how long it took REvil to further develop and integrate KPOT into its
attacks. However, shortly after its purchase, in December 2020, the gang compromised
another significant target — “The Hospital Group,” a large plastic surgery chain known
for its celebrity clients.48 REvil did not learn its lesson after failing to extort public
figures when they previously compromised the entertainment law firm. Similar to other
incidents, REvil conducted their typical attack chain of stealing and then encrypting the
plastic surgeon’s data. REvil threatened to release intimate patient photos such as their
“before and after” pictures if the organization did not pay the ransom.
It was over the next few months when REvil’s endeavor to advance their effort and recruit
more experienced and advanced affiliates finally paid off. First, on January 14, 2021,
Pan-Asian Group “Dairy Farm,” a retailer with over ten thousand locations throughout
Asia, became one of the year’s first victims.49, 50 Unfortunately, the Dairy Farm Group did
not understand the full magnitude of the breach. According to early reports, Dairy Farm
believed the attacker impacted only a small portion of their network. Additionally, Dairy
Farm did not believe REvil stole their data or had access to their network.
The Dairy Farm Group either did not want to disclose the full impact
of the attack or was truly unaware of how bad things were about to

infrastructure for future phishing campaigns. While we cannot confirm
if this ever came to fruition, it is an interesting play by the attacker,
who could leverage the access acquired in the initial Dairy Farms attack to infect their
customers and partners via Dairy Farms’ own infrastructure.51 Making things more
alarming, REvil demanded Dairy Farm pay $30 million, the highest ransom demanded by
any ransomware gang, at the time. However, the record ransom lasted for only a short
time.

25

On March 14, 2021, REvil attacked the Taiwanese computer manufacturer Acer and
demanded $50 million, which would increase to $100 million if not paid at the termination
of the data auction.52 Acer unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a $10 million payment, which
the attacker rejected. While Acer did not pay the $50 million ransom, on April 18, 2021,
REvil continued their pursuit with another high-profile target, Quanta Computers, asking
for the same amount. Similar to other attacks, in addition to exposing Quanta, REvil also
threatened to expose data associated with their customers. Except this time, REvil had
far more leverage since Quanta manufactured laptops for the computer and phone giant
Apple. Now, REvil threatened to release sensitive blueprints associated with Apple’s
new laptop and smartwatch.53 Quanta denied the severity of the breach publicly, but the
leaked data made it clear REvil was not bluffing.54, 55 When Quanta chose not to pay, REvil
threatened Apple directly:

“Drawings of all Apple devices and all personal data of employees and customers
will be published with subsequent sale.” — REvil
Then, on April 20, while Apple announced new products at a live online sales event, REvil
leaked additional data to include schematics of Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptop. REvil
also threatened to release additional data every day until the action ran out or Apple paid
the ransom. However, REvil terminated their auction early, removed Apple data from
their leak site, and made no further threats or ransom demands to Apple. Usually, this
only happens if a victim pays. It would appear REvil’s attempt to hire highly skilled hackers
as affiliates after several failed attempts finally paid off for a big payout.

Give Your Self to

27

Part III: Give Yourself to the DarkSide
Have you ever seen a fictional movie where the villain has an overzealous sidekick or
protégé that screws everything up? If this were one of those stories, that protege would
be DarkSide. DarkSide was another RaaS provider that conducted attacks from August
2020 through May 2021. DarkSide was a well-versed and sophisticated attacker, but
they were too ambitious for their own good. Like REvil, DarkSide started as an affiliate
supporting another RaaS provider. You likely guessed that provider was REvil.56
Several ties exist between the two gangs to support this theory. DarkSide’s ransomware
shared similar code found only in REvil’s Sodinokibi payload. REvil controls Sodinokibi and
its source code, which is not publicly available. It is unlikely the REvil gang would share it
unless a trusted relationship existed between both parties. We believe the individuals
behind DarkSide likely knew or, at a minimum, associated closely with REvil operators.
Further, both REvil and DarkSide operators participate in the same underground Russianspeaking forums and post within the same threads. Making the tie stronger, REvil has
posted messages publicly on behalf of the DarkSide gang. Next, we discuss DarkSide’s
final operation in detail. This is important to our story because it starts a series of events
that lead to REvil’s demise.

DarkSide’s Blunder
On May 7, 2021, the DarkSide gang attacked Colonial Pipeline, the organization
responsible for distributing fuel across the entire east coast of the United States. The
impact of the attack forced Colonial to shut down pipeline operations. As a result, a fuel
shortage ensued. Many Americans across the east coast could not obtain fuel for their
vehicles. More importantly, concern grew that emergency services could be affected by
the fuel shortage.
The attack caused unease among the population. US citizens wanted answers about how
cybercriminals could disrupt a significant element of US critical infrastructure. The US
government saw this as an aggression against national security, questioning if a criminal
organization could have conducted the attack on its own or had help from a foreign
government. Further, the Biden administration received criticism as fear grew that the
fuel shortage would impact emergency services and critical infrastructure.
Due to the impact and criticism, President Biden addressed the situation, stating the
United States would go after whoever was behind the attack. He also planned to address

28

the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two met the following month.
Shortly after the statement, DarkSide posted the following message to the “press” section
of their data leak site:

“We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with
a defined government and look for other our motives,” the group wrote in a recent
statement on its dark web site. “Our goal is to make money and not creating
problems for society. From today, we introduce moderation and check each
company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the
future.” — DarkSide
Based on their statement, DarkSide realized they went too far and gained the attention
they had not expected from the US government. The following day, DarkSide’s payment
portal, leak site, and content delivery network (CDN) went offline.57
With the US government in pursuit and the loss of operating resources, DarkSide
made one final post on an underground forum declaring they were shutting down their
operation. Intel471, a cyber intelligence company, translated the post, which they detail
in their blog here. Also, DarkSide stated they intended to pay their affiliates money owed
and provide decryption keys necessary to decrypt data should existing victims decide
to pay.
On May 14, 2021, seven days after the pipeline attack, the administrators on the affiliate
recruitment forums banned future discussions about ransomware, aka “lockers.” It was
wise to restrict the topic to stay in business and keep US intelligence and law enforcement
agencies from interfering with their operations. Administrators likely knew the same
attention would fall on their forums should it continue to support ransomware operations.

Figure 10: Ransomware ban posted by administrators on a dark web forum (translated from Russian)

Further, administrators banned DarkSide and took their bitcoin deposit for themselves.58
A few weeks later, in early June, the Department of State announced they “seized
63.7 bitcoins currently valued at approximately $2.3 million” from the DarkSide attacker.59
Strangely, while taking responsibility for the seizure of funds, the United States claimed

29

they were not behind the infrastructure takedown. Nonetheless, it’s widely speculated
the takedown effort was, in fact, the work of the United States Cyber Command.60
This would not be the first time the US government conducted a “takedown” operation
to remove assets used by cyber adversaries. However, it is the first time we have seen
such a large amount of cryptocurrency taken from a crypto wallet unbeknownst to its
legitimate owner.
Still, DarkSide obtained far more in ransom payments over the lifetime of their operation
than they lost in the seizure of funds. Yet, despite promising to pay their affiliate partners,
DarkSide left many of their peer criminals unpaid after the takedown. As a result, they
trashed their reputation in the Russian criminal community, and several affiliates filed
arbitration claims against them for millions of dollars’ worth of owed money.
Note: Russian-based criminals who support ransomware operations rely on the
criminal court system, known as arbitration, to recover unpaid funds for work
conducted on another criminal’s behalf. For additional information, see our blog
“Dark Web – Justice League,” which details the underground arbitration process.
Now, DarkSide was hiding from the US government and the criminals they owed money
to. Due to their absence, REvil acted as a spokesman on DarkSide’s behalf. In a public
statement posted to a Russian OSINT telegram channel, REvil provided details confirming
the takedown of DarkSide’s infrastructure and loss of funding.61
After disappearing, many researchers wondered if DarkSide would stop their criminal
activity or rebrand and return with a new online persona. While outside the scope of
this report, researchers Fabian Wosar and Brett Callow of Emsisoft found evidence to
support DarkSide may have returned later that summer as the BlackMatter ransomware
gang.62 You can find additional information in their blog covering their findings.
Shortly after speaking for DarkSide, while the United States’ response took place in May,
REvil conducted another high-profile attack. This time, the victim was JBS USA Holdings,
Inc., a Brazilian-based meat processing and distribution company. JBS processed and
distributed one-fifth of the meat distributed throughout the United States. Due to the
attack, JBS shut down parts of its operation, resulting in meat shortages across the
United States. To address the situation, JBS decided to pay the $11 million ransom to bring
services back online quickly. While the impact was not as bad as it could have been, fear
and concern among the US population rose. In the same month, ransomware attackers
impacted both fuel and food resources across the country. DarkSide may have run, but
REvil stood its ground, taunting the United States.

30

The Double-Cross
In May, while the Colonial Pipeline and JBS attacks were occurring, an affiliate opened an
arbitration case. This complaint, however, was against REvil, not DarkSide. The affiliate
claimed REvil owed them over $14 million for work they did to breach and extort a large
“holding company.” The affiliate said they negotiated the ransom with an employee
named William. Apparently, the affiliate and negotiator agreed on a ransom amount the
victim would pay in exchange for the decryption key. However, they needed a few days
to allocate the funds and transfer them to bitcoin. Time passed, and the affiliate had not
received payment from William. Finally, several days later, William responded with one
final message:

Figure 11: Victim message (email) to REvil affiliate as posted as evidence in their arbitration case

In the complaint, the affiliate continued to prove his case to the arbitrator. He stated that
only the provider, REvil, had the decryption key, which he believed William obtained.
The affiliate believed REvil double-crossed them and made the deal to provide the key
to William themselves. The affiliate provided logs and emails of their negotiation with
William to support their claim. The logs supported that the affiliate did indeed conduct the
breach, deploye the ransomware, and negotiate with William. Still, they could not prove
that REvil made contact or received a payment from the victim. The affiliate believed
that REvil interfered with the negotiation and made a deal without them, taking all the
proceeds. Further, only four days later, REvil deposited $1 million in bitcoin to the same
forum in which arbitration took place and began recruiting other affiliates. Based on the
deposit made to the forum, REvil may have influenced the arbitrator’s decision. While
the deposit funds are not intended to benefit the forum administrator, they have direct
access to the money itself and can (and have) confiscated funds from users who have been
banned. The arbitrator refused to award compensation to the complainant without proof
of payment. Some individuals on the forum were also displeased the complainant provided
so much information and evidence at the public level. They were concerned researchers,
like us, who would write about it. Others, like LockBit, a competing ransomware gang,
claimed they had heard similar claims about REvil from other affiliates. For now, it was the

31

affiliate’s word against REvil’s and, unfortunately, had little impact on REvil’s ransomware
business or their ability to recruit affiliates at that time.

Part IV:
Good vs. REvil
33

Part IV: Good vs. REvil
On June 16, 2021, both Russian and US presidents met in Geneva as planned. Both
administrations had a full schedule of issues and topics prepared for the meeting. However,
ransomware dominated the discussion. President Biden requested help from the Russian
government to deter criminals and warned if the attacks continued, the United States
would “respond in kind.”63 If the attack against US critical infrastructure by the Russianbased DarkSide attacker did not occur, it’s unlikely the two world leaders would even
have discussed ransomware. Now, it was the focus of their first meeting.
You would expect an adversary like REvil, who tries so hard to portray themselves as
an elite attacker, would have the sense to lay low until the storm passed. Instead, again
in June, REvil posted another message to the Russian OSINT Telegram channel they
previously used to discuss DarkSide after the pipeline attack. This time, they directed
their declaration directly to the United States government. REvil stated they were “not
afraid of being labeled a cyber-terrorist group” and “in light of US actions and posturing
to retaliate for the JBS Foods attack, the group will now lift the restriction on attacking
US targets.”64 Just a few weeks later, REvil made good on their threat and conducted their
most significant attack yet.
On July 2, 2021, REvil executed an attack against Kaseya, the US-based MSP we
discussed at the start of this white paper. REvil began with a SQL attack to exploit a zeroday vulnerability (CVE-2021-30116) in Kaseya’s Virtual System Administrator (VSA)
servers. As an MSP, one of Kaseya’s business practices is to push software updates to its
clients, ensuring downstream customers maintain and stay current with its software.65
REvil leveraged Kaseya’s patching process and client-trusting infrastructure to push a
weaponized update, infecting 1,500 companies across 22 countries.66 On a good note,
Kaseya was transparent about the attack and its impact, unlike many of REvil’s previous
victims. They also reacted quickly, turning off vulnerable VSA servers, which prevented
REvil from infecting additional customers.
The United States government took note of the aggression. Shortly after Kaseya reported
the incident, President Biden addressed reporters at a press conference. He was “still
gathering information to the full extent of that attack” and that he had just “received an
update from (his) national security team” and would “have more to say about this in the
next several days,” but he felt “good about our ability to be able to respond.”67
Additionally, the White House put out an official statement about the Kaseya attack:
“Yesterday, President Biden directed the full resources of the government to investigate

34

this (Kaseya) incident.”68 REvil was now the focus of interest for US national security
resources, such as Cyber Command, CISA, DIA, and other US intelligence agencies with
more significant resources than law enforcement alone.69
Despite the United States’ response, REvil demanded $70 million, one of their highest
ransom demands to date, in exchange for a universal decryption key that Kaseya victims
could use to restore their data. Further taunting the United States, REvil added an entry
to their website naming Kaseya as their latest victim.

Figure 13: REvil Happy Blog post for Kaseya

Eleven days after attacking Kaseya, in the early hours of the morning on July 13, 2021,
REvil’s infrastructure used to leak and auction victim data, as well as their payment portal,
mysteriously went offline.70 This included both REvil infrastructure hosted on the dark
web and sites accessed from the traditional internet. We do not know if REvil willingly
took its infrastructure down or if it went offline as part of a covert government operation.
However, several sources, including other Russian ransomware gangs such as the LockBit
gang, claimed on underground forums that REvil took down their infrastructure due to
pending government actions with their site-hosting providers.
Alternatively, the US government may have conducted a hostile takedown of REvil’s
sites. In our opinion, the government would take credit and highlight the takedown as
a victory in its new, very public war on ransomware. Remember, several embarrassing
attacks occurred earlier that year in which the United States had no recourse before its
response against DarkSide. We think they would want to make a public example if they
were behind the takedown. Realizing this, we agree REvil decided to delete their virtual
footprint and remove all their infrastructures to prevent the United States from using it
against them in their pending operations.
REvil talked a big game. Yet only a month after taking a bold stance against the United
States, the individuals hiding behind the REvil persona were quiet as a mouse. There
were no more threats, no more grandstanding, and, most importantly, no more attacks. It
would seem no one wanted anything to do with REvil, including the forums in which they
35

frequented. The administrators of the top two underground forums banned the account
REvil used to recruit and communicate with the criminal underground.
REvil may have vanished, but Kaseya and its customers still faced the challenge of decrypting
their data. Many of Kaseya’s customers affected by the attack were upset because they
no longer had an option to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. However, on
July 22, 2021, things took an unexpected twist. A “trusted third party” provided Kaseya
and its customers with the decryption key necessary to unlock their data.71 Normally, only
REvil could access and provide the key. Remember, REvil demanded $70 million for the
key, so they would unlikely give it away for free.
The obvious questions: who was the third party and how did it obtain the decryption
key. We know this was not a “back-alley deal” because the third party required victims to
sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). An NDA would be useless if the third party were
a criminal. However, it would be helpful if the third party were the US government and
did not want to disclose how they obtained the key. The problem was, some customers
paid the ransom weeks prior, and others already spent considerable time and money in
rebuilding their infrastructure.72 If the US government had released the key, they should
have kept the victims abreast of the effort before victims spent millions to recover. As news
of the key began to circulate, media organizations began to report the key originated from
the Russian government. According to Bleeping Computer, Russian intelligence may have
obtained the key directly from REvil and provided it to the United States. This theory is
plausible since the United States asked Russia to intervene during the Putin/Biden meeting.
Several weeks later, on August 5, 2021, a user named “Ekranoplan” posted a message on
one of the underground forums with a link to a GitHub page that included a screenshot of
the decryption key.73, 74
It is impossible to validate, but the individual behind the post claimed they obtained the
key from their “parent company.”

Figure 14: Forum post about REvil decryption key

Part V:
Deliver Us
from REvil
37

Part V: Deliver Us from REvil
Almost two months passed in which the world had not heard from REvil. Then on
September 7, 2021, REvil’s infrastructure came back online. Their data leak/auction site
and payment portal were suddenly up and running. Previous victims who had not paid
their ransom had new auction timers set. A few days later, REvil created new accounts on
the same underground forums that previously banned their accounts.
Further, Bleeping Computer published screenshots of a recent conversation between
REvil and a security researcher.75 In the discussion, REvil stated they had taken a break.
Again, of the possible theories, we think it is likely REvil realized a takedown operation
was underway and took their own infrastructure offline. We know we cannot trust REvil.
Eventually, the FBI acknowledged they were the “trusted third party” who provided
victims with the encryption key. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, other law
enforcement agencies involved in the investigation were to blame for the delayed release
of the key and lack of transparency.76 Unfortunately, he did not state how they acquired
the key.
If you recall, an affiliate had a dispute with REvil earlier that year in May 2021. This incident
was far more significant than anyone comprehended at the time. The affiliate had opened
an arbitration case claiming that REvil deceptively took over the negotiation process and
never paid them. You see, what we did not know then was that the accusations were not
only accurate, but they were part of a much larger plot. Now, in September, researchers
at AdvIntel found evidence proving REvil had built in a backdoor allowing them to cheat
their criminal business partners.
Specifically, AdvIntel found evidence that REvil used the backdoor to establish a second
chat session with victims, unbeknownst to the affiliate.77 Affiliates relied on an admin
console to manage the attack and communicate with the victim. The “double chat”
capability allowed REvil to monitor these conversations. If the conversation went well and
REvil believed the victim would pay, they would make it appear to the affiliate the victim
had a change of heart and terminate the discussion. Then, secretly, they (REvil) negotiate
with the victim directly. To the affiliate, it would appear the victim simply decided not to
pay and disappeared. In reality, REvil finished the negotiation independently and collected
the ransom. Based on promises in their recruitment ads, REvil would have to share 70%
of the profit. Now they kept all of it for themselves.
Affiliates and other criminals across the Russian forums quickly began to turn on REvil
as the news spread. However, the loudest voice came from the affiliate, whose post
38

we discussed earlier. The news validated his claims. Now there was no question, REvil
were deceptive liars that even criminals could not trust. Figure 15 displays the affiliate
complaint:

Figure 15: Signature’s post following news of REvil’s double-cross

Still, REvil tried to conduct damage control and defend their actions. Using their two new
forum accounts, they responded to the allegations. REvil responded to other criminals
on the forums, which discussed their actions. Nevertheless, no one believed them. One
user took REvil’s Sodinokibi code and directly pointed out binary evidence in a detailed
analysis directed at REvil. Still, REvil was adamant that they had not double-crossed
their partners.

39

Figure 16: Forum post analyzing the Sodinokibi payload and pointing out the backdoor found in its
code (translated from Russian)

Another forum member also challenged REvil directly and wanted to know how they
could trust them. REvil obviously thought they could talk their way out of the situation
because they continued to post and defend themselves rather than close their account
and disappear. However, the damage was done. Figure 17 shows an affiliate challenging
REvil’s (0_newday) previous post in which they attempt to portray themselves as a “victim
of slander.”

Figure 17: Forum post challenging REvil’s trustworthiness in relation to their hidden backdoor used to
double-cross affiliates (translated from Russian)

As you can see, REvil destroyed its own reputation, losing credibility with affiliates across
the ransomware scene.
It seemed like things could not get much worse for REvil. However, on October 16, 2021,
it did. Someone sabotaged REvil’s infrastructure and secretly took control of their Tor
servers. The attacker could have taken REvil’s servers offline. Instead, they left it up and
running, appearing exactly as it did under REvil’s control. Unfortunately, due to their
paranoia, REvil identified the compromise immediately.

41

Realizing what happened, REvil made their final post to the underground Russian forum.
In their post, REvil stated “the server was compromised” and that someone “deleted the
path to my hidden service in the torrc file and raised their own so that I would go there.

Figure 18: REvil post claiming their infrastructure was compromised (translated from Russian)

While REvil identified the operation against them, it still resulted in a positive outcome.
With affiliates turned against them and a third party infiltrating their internal servers,
REvil decided to close its ransomware operation. After more than two years of wreaking
havoc, REvil ran away embarrassed and defeated. Still, you have to wonder, who was
behind the sabotage operation?
Affiliates and criminals closest to REvil discussed two theories on the underground
forums. The first was that another REvil operator who had previously been the group’s
voice had gone rouge and attempted to take over their servers. We don’t feel this theory
is likely. There is little benefit in sabotaging a dying operation. The second theory, which
we believe to be accurate, is that the US government was behind the operation to hijack
and compromise REvil’s infrastructure. The US government had the motivation and ability
to conduct the operation.
Remember, this was an offensive strike, but the attacker did not intend to result in a loss
of services forcing REvil to stop their operation. Instead, the attacker intentionally tried
to go unnoticed, hoping REvil would continue business as usual. Then, the entity behind
the attack could quietly observe REvil’s actions, collect evidence, and gather intelligence
on the gang itself and the affiliates who support them. We believe the operation was the
work of US intelligence agencies who were fed up with REvil and building a case against
them. While Russia historically has protected ransomware criminals, the genius of this
operation is that, despite this, it resulted in the demise of REvil. Further, it most certainly
had a psychological effect on both REvil and affiliates. They likely wondered if the United
States could infiltrate REvil’s operation; what else did they know.

42

Faces of REvil
On November 8, 2021, the US government answered this question publicly. The United
States issued indictments against two men whom they claimed supported REvil and took
part in the attack against Kaseya.78 The first indictment was against Yaroslav Vasinskyi,
22, a Ukrainian national, and Yevgyeniy Polyanin, a Russian citizen. Additionally, the US
Department of Justice stated two other Sodinokibi/REvil affiliates in Romania were also
under arrest. The United States seized over $6 million in bitcoin currency from a REvilowned digital wallet.
Vasinskyi was arrested in Poland and is awaiting extradition to the United States. He
shockingly had poor OSINT practices. While only his first name, we found it odd for a
cybercriminal to use any part of their actual name in their online identities, but he did. He
used the online monikers “Yarik45,” and “Yaroslav2468.” Yaroslav used the same handles
across numerous forums and social media websites, creating a large online footprint.
Yaroslav also registered email addresses on some of these sites, making it easy to pinpoint
his identity once you knew he associated with REvil. The second individual indicted,
Yevgyeniy Polyanin, is also believed to be an affiliate who supported REvil operations.
Specifically, the United States believes he took part in the attack against Kaseya.
Below you can see images of both men. Figure 19 displays the FBI wanted poster for
Polyanin. The second image, Figure 20, displays Vasinskyi as seen on social media.

The real question is, did Vasinskyi’s parents sign his field trip form the day this photo was
taken? We may never know. Regardless, the indictment certainly sent a message that the
United States could identify individuals behind REvil attacks. However, its impact was
minimal, and the men named were only REvil affiliates and not core members of the gang
itself. Still, the United States continues to pursue REvil, offering millions for information
leading to the arrest of the gang’s leadership. The US Department of State released the
following statement regarding REvil members still at large:

“The Department of State is offering a reward of up to $10,000,000 for information
leading to the identification or location of any individual holding a key leadership
position in the Sodinokibi ransomware variant transnational organized crime group.
In addition, the Department is offering a reward offer of up to $5,000,000 for
information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual
conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a Sodinokibi variant
ransomware incident.” — US Department of State80
We thought this was the end of REvil’s story. However, on January 14, 2022, Russian
authorities conducted night raids, kicking in doors and taking 14 individuals into custody.
Allegedly, the individuals include the gang’s ringleaders and not affiliates alone, like the
previous arrests in Ukraine. According to a press release on the Russian FSB website, the
raid was a joint operation between the Russian FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs

44

(MVD) conducted at the request of the United States. Russia also stated they kept US
authorities informed of the outcome of the operation.

Figure 21: FSB Press release about raids on members of REvil81, 82

The REvil members arrested were apprehended in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and in the
regions of Leningrad and Lipetsk. As of this writing, the FSB has not released the identities
of the men arrested. However, a Russian court identified two of the men as Roman
Muromsky and Andrei Bessonov and placed them in custody for two months while they
are tried for their crimes.83
Additionally, while arresting REvil’s members, the FSB confiscated nearly $7 million (in
total), 20 “premium cars,” and computer equipment. A camera crew present during the
operation recorded footage as the FSB raided several of the accused men’s homes.84
The arrests will make a significant impact on ransomware criminals. More importantly,
this is where REvil’s story ends.

Assessment:
Beyond Good
and REvil

Assessment: Beyond Good and REvil
It is too early to tell if Russia will continue to hold ransomware criminals accountable
despite the arrests. In recent months, Russia has been posturing troops along the border
of Ukraine in what many believe is the early stages of a military invasion. The cooperation
may only be an effort to build a stronger relationship with the United States, hoping
it will not interfere should a military conflict ensue. Suppose the United States does
interfere or attempt to enforce additional sanctions against Russia, which seems likely.
In that case, the cooperation will likely cease, and ransomware criminals will once again
be protected by the Russian government as long as they do not target organizations in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Another concern is history will repeat
itself, and Russian Intelligence will recruit cybercriminals, such as REvil operators, to
support their needs. In our previous report, Nation-State Ransomware, we describe
several past instances where this exact scenario occurred.86 Regardless of the arrests,
we do not believe REvil could continue to operate based on the distrust and loathing the
ransomware community has for the gang.

Impact
Russia is not charging members of REvil with computer crimes, among other charges they
would face in the United States. Russia is charging REvil only with committing crimes “under
Part 2 of Art. 187 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation” (“Illegal circulation of
means of payment”).87 In the past, sentencing guidelines in Russia show criminals found
guilty of the same charge were imprisoned for no more than seven to ten years. While
this is a long time, it certainly does not seem to fit the crimes REvil committed in their
lifetime of attacks.
Prior to the arrests, Russian ransomware criminals within dark web communities had little
to no fear of repercussions for their actions. Based on conversations over the past several
years on these forums, ransomware criminals believed they were untouchable. The only
concern commonly discussed by forum members were arrests should they leave Russia.
Based on REvil’s story and events that have been detailed in this paper, we wanted to
address how, if at all, the events have changed the mindset and/or operational lifecycle of
ransomware attacks.
To answer these questions, we looked to the members of the underground criminal
community that REvil used for affiliate recruitment themselves. Shortly after news broke

48

of Russia’s cooperation with the United States, leading to the REvil arrests, several of the
community’s members began to discuss the topic, as displayed in Figure 23 below.

Figure 23: Messages on Russian underground forum used by REvil that discuss the fallout of the
January 2022 REvil arrests (translated from Russian)

We were surprised to see the tone in the conversation change. Of course, some criminals
will stand by their original viewpoint on the topic. Yet this is the first time we have seen
broad concern regarding ransomware attacks. While the United States may never
prosecute REvil or other Russian-based ransomware criminals in their own court
of law, they have psychologically impacted the Russian ransomware community.
Honestly, we did not think the day would come where criminals would make statements
like “the balance has changed” and be concerned they could “go to jail.” These are only a
few examples of many similar concerns voiced in the ransomware community over the
past 48 hours since the arrests. Initially, this may sound like a small win, but in our opinion,
this is a huge accomplishment and the first significant step to thwart future ransomware
attacks. Getting into the head of your adversary could undoubtedly impact its future
actions.
Next, we want to access how this affects ransomware gangs from an operations
perspective. This time, we wanted to look to other well-known ransomware service
49

providers to see if there was evidence of them making changes to how they conducted
their day-to-day criminal activities. One of the prominent gangs known to voice their
opinion within the ransomware community is the LockBit gang, whom we assessed in our
previous reporting. At that time, LockBit was a bold and highly intuitive gang that often
developed new methods and techniques to compromise targets. Unlike REvil, LockBit is
straightforward in its communications on the underground forums, has a good reputation,
and keeps its word with affiliates, making them a viable information source.
Historically speaking, LockBit has always been critical of REvil and suspected that they
were untrustworthy, even before evidence had surfaced. However, at the time, we
believed it was simply their bias since they directly compete with REvil for affiliates within
the ransomware space. When affiliates began to complain, LockBit quickly criticized REvil,
making comments REvil could not be trusted.
LockBit was also one of the first to accuse REvil of working with the United States, once
the FBI released REvil’s decryption key to Kaseya victims. In a conversation on the forum,
LockBit challenged REvil to explain how the key leaked. REvil told the LockBit operator
that one of their developers “misclicked and generated a universal decryptor.” LockBit
was not buying the story or letting REvil off the hook with their explanation. He pointed
out how careful the group operated and how convenient the timing of the leaked key
correlated with the US/Kaseya incident.

Figure 24: REvil forum post responding to LockBit (translated from Russian)

You could see things beginning to unravel. LockBit began posting messages about not
trusting anyone and claimed “snitches are everywhere.” In another post, LockBit called
for new vetting procedures in which trusted forum members could review code and
ensure its developers do not install backdoors into their ransomware payloads.

50

Figure 25: LockBit post calling for better operational security and vetting of both ransomware code
and the developers who create it

Further, LockBit wanted the developers themselves to be “vetted” to ensure they were
not secretly working with the FBI, as it believed REvil did. In short, LockBit believed
REvil was compromised and working with the FBI, which it repeats in several other posts
between September 2021 and January 2022.
In January, after news of the arrests in Russia, LockBit posted a private conversation,
something rarely done, that it had with a REvil operator who used the alias “REvil 0neday.”

51

Figure 26: Post of private conversation between REvil and LockBit operators

The issue was the REvil operator disappeared in November 2021, shortly after their
conversation. LockBit believed another individual he referred to as “RED \ KAJIT” was to
blame. LockBit stated KAJIT was an administrator on another underground forum and
was working with the FBI. In November, administrators took the forum down for several
days before the REvil operator’s disappearance. If LockBit is correct, KAJIT may have
provided the FBI with information or possibly access to all its members and back-end
data, which is how the FBI could get to REvil and potentially other ransomware affiliates.

Conclusion

53

Conclusion
REvil’s narrative sounds more like fiction than reality. Their story includes:
• Multi-million-dollar ransom schemes
• Meetings between world leaders
• Secret government operations
• Hidden backdoors and betrayal
• Night raids and arrests
The only thing missing is a good car chase. While REvil’s story is fascinating, it also
provides us with a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of organized criminal
ransomware gangs. As defenders and researchers, we often focus on technical details
and rarely get insights into the human aspect of attacks. Between research reports,
government indictments, video footage, and several years of conversations and
discussions on underground forums, we feel REvil’s account provides the most in-depth
use-case to date on a ransomware gang and their criminal operation. It is also the first
time we have captured the entire life cycle, from the cradle to the grave, of a ransomware
gang and their operation.
REvil’s biggest mistake was their ego, which led to their downfall. Had they targeted
smaller, non-essential organizations and not betrayed their own people, they would
likely still operate their crime syndicate instead of facing prison. While REvil is unlikely
ever to show its face again, ransomware will continue to be a problem. However, with
governments increasingly taking this problem head-on, dedicating vast resources
to mitigate the problem, we hope to see attacks decrease. We also believe Russia’s
involvement in this problem is critical to reducing or mitigating ransomware attacks. If the
Russian government falls back to its long-standing practice of protecting cybercriminals,
it’s unlikely we will resolve the ransomware problem anytime soon.
