BianLian: New Ransomware variant on the rise

GoLang-based Ransomware targets multiple industries
Cyble Research Labs has observed that malware written in the programming language “Go” has recently
been popular among Threat Actors (TAs). This is likely due to its cross-platform functionalities and the
fact that it makes reverse engineering more difficult. We have seen many threats developed using the Go
language, such as Ransomware, RAT, Stealer, etc.
During our routine threat-hunting exercise, we came across a Twitter post about a ransomware variant
written in Go named “BianLian,” which was first identified halfway through July 2022.
The ransomware has targeted many well-known organizations (9 victims so far) across several industry
sectors such as Manufacturing, Education, Healthcare, BFSI, etc. In the figure below, we have prepared
a breakdown of the industries targeted by the BianLian ransomware.

Technical Analysis
We have taken the below sample hash for the purposes of this analysis:
(SHA256), eaf5e26c5e73f3db82cd07ea45e4d244ccb3ec3397ab5263a1a74add7bbcb6e2, which is a 64bit GoLang binary executable.
The unique build ID of the GoLang ransomware is shown below.

Figure 2 – Go Build ID
Upon execution of the ransomware, it attempts to identify if the file is running in a WINE environment by
checking the wine_get_version() function via the GetProcAddress() API.

Then, the ransomware creates multiple threads using the CreateThread() API function to perform faster
file encryption, making reverse engineering the malware more difficult. The below figure shows the
multiple threads created by the ransomware.

Figure 4 – Multiple Thread Creation
Next, the malware identifies the system drives (from A:\ to Z:\) using the GetDriveTypeW() API function
and encrypts any files available in the connected drives. Then, the malware drops a ransom note in
multiple folders with the file name “Look at this instruction.txt.”
The ransomware creates a ransom note with the content shown below.

Figure 5 – Malware Writing Ransom Notes
After dropping the ransom note, the malware searches files and directories for encryption by enumerating
them using the FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW() API functions.
The ransomware excludes the below file extensions and file/folder names from encryption.
File extension

.exe, .dll, .sys, .txt, .lnk and .html

File names

bootmgr, BOOTNXT, pagefile.sys, thumbs.db, ntuser.dat and swapfile.sys

Folder names

Windows, Windows.old

The ransomware usesGoLang Packages such as “crypto/cipher,” “crypto/aes” and “crypto/rsa” for file
encryption on the victim machine.

GoLang Packages
For encryption, the malware divides the file content into 10 bytes chunks. First, it reads 10 bytes from the
original file, then encrypts the bytes and writes the encrypted data into the target file. Dividing the data
into small chunks is a method to evade detection by Anti-Virus products.
The figure below shows the code snippet of the encryption loop and the original and infected file content
before and after encryption.

In the next step, the malware renames the encrypted files with the “.bianlian” extension and replaces
them with the original file using the MoveFileExW() API function, as shown below.

Figure 8 – MoveFileExW() API
Finally, the ransomware deletes itself using the following command line, leaving only the encrypted files
and the ransom note on the victim’s machine.
cmd /c del C:\Users\<Admin>\Desktop\new_one.exe
The below figure shows the BianLian ransomware encrypted files and ransom note text file after the
successful infection of a victim’s machine.

Figure 9 – Files encrypted by BianLian Ransomware
In the dropped ransom note, victims are given instructions on how they can contact the TAs to restore
their encrypted files.
The TAs threaten their victims, stating that their important data, such as financial, client, business,
technical, and personal files, has been downloaded and will be posted on their leak site if the ransom is
not paid within ten days.
The ransom note also contains the ID of TOX Messenger for ransom negotiations and the Onion URL of
the leak site page – shown in the figure below.

contact details for ransomware data recovery.

Conclusion
Ransomware is becoming an increasingly common and effective attack method that affects organizations
and their productivity. BianLian is GoLang-based ransomware that continues to breach several industries
and demand large ransom amounts. The TAs also use the double extortion method by stealing an
affected organization’s files and leaking them online if the ransom is not paid on time.
TAs write their ransomware in GoLang for various reasons; the language enables a single codebase to
be compiled into all major operating systems. The TAs behind BianLian are constantly making changes
and adding new capabilities to avoid detection.
Cyble Research Labs will continue to monitor BianLian and other similar Ransomware groups’ activities
and analyze them to better understand their motivations.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Safety Measures Needed to Prevent Ransomware Attacks
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
Users Should Take the Following Steps After the Ransomware Attack
Detach infected devices on the same network.
Disconnect external storage devices if connected.
Inspect system logs for suspicious events.
