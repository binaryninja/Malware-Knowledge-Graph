While Splunk was not impacted by the ransomware attack, as a security leader we want
to help the industry by providing tools, guidance and support. If you want to see how to find
Kaseya REvil specifics skip down to the “Detecting REvil Ransomware Kaseya in
Splunk” sections. Otherwise, read on for a quick breakdown of what happened, how to
detect it, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.

Introduction
When Splunk told me we would have a “breach holiday” theme for the summer, I didn’t think
it would be quite so on the nose… For those of you who have been working on this Kaseya
REvil Ransomware incident over the weekend, I salute you. We’ve been doing the same. As
usual, my team here at Splunk likes to make sure that we have some actionable material
before posting a blog, and this time is no different. In the sections below, you will see that we

1/18

break this out into a little bit of a different format than usual. We first discuss what happened
and what you need to know if you are actively hunting/looking for REvil ransomware via the
Kaseya VSA. We then discuss the work done by Splunk's Threat Research Team regarding
a deep dive on REvil, which you can read here. This deep dive will complement our
significant, existing body of content focused on helping organizations detect any and all
strains of ransomware. Heck, we even did a write-up talking about the Executive Order and
memo on ransomware from the US Federal government.
Finally, we will talk about the future; what we have in store to help you train and better
prepare for events like this before they happen again. Not to mention how to think about your
software supply chain. Why? Because like your alarm clock blasting “I’ve got you babe”
every morning at 6 AM, this will happen again. Our recent “State of Security” report showed
that 78% of security and IT leaders fear that a SolarWinds-style attack will hit them.
Guess what? This is one of them. As always, remember that this is a breaking news event,
and while every effort has been made, some of our recommended searches may not be as
accurate or performant as we desire.

What You Need to Know
On Friday afternoon, July 2nd, 2021, in what is becoming entirely too familiar a scenario,
internet rumors of a "supply-chain ransomware" attack began circulating on Reddit. As
reports of more systems becoming encrypted surfaced, the "rumors" were confirmed:
Kaseya VSA, remote monitoring management (RMM) software heavily used by managed
service providers (MSP), was compromised by REvil, and being used to distribute
ransomware to its on-premises customers. Since VSA requires elevated permissions to
execute, an adversary was able to use it to disable Microsoft Defender and efficiently
distribute ransomware via endpoint agents. Its compromise led to a cascading effect of
encrypted machines at the MSP customers. Eventually, organizations that don't even use
Kaseya were being infected with ransomware. As this is an ongoing incident, we'll provide
updates and content as we collect more data.

Worried about Today, Tomorrow, and Beyond?
Unpacking this latest incident shows three significant security areas to address. We’ll be
releasing content to help in each of these areas, so stay tuned.
Ransomware is one of the biggest security threats to most organizations today The frequency and severity of ransomware attacks are increasing, as are the blogs and
guidance we release to help net defenders maintain their organization's security
posture.
Operational supply chain compromises and their impacts - The diversity and
complexity of interconnected services we rely on daily - a fancy way of saying if a cog
in that technical or service wheel gets stuck (or… encrypted) - uhoh, trouble.

2/18

Your software supply chain - The Kaseya incident very much has shades of
PHP/SolarWinds activity, showing how destructive unauthorized modifications to
software packages can be. If you are a software developer or a user of the software, it
has become increasingly apparent that organizations need to have a better
understanding of the processes involved in updating or developing software that they
use or sell.
If you are a Kaseya VSA on-prem customer, drop down to the “Detecting REvil
Ransomware Kaseya in Splunk” section to immediately assess your environment using
Splunk or take a peek at the wealth of content in the MITRE ATT&CK section where we pull
every Splunk security search we have that maps to REvil TTPs via the MITRE ATT&CK
method.

Detecting REvil Ransomware Kaseya in Splunk
As many of you know, the primary challenge in detecting ransomware is the speed with
which ransomware can impact systems. With a rapid response, the spread of ransomware
can be limited. Unfortunately, in most cases, by the time an attack is detected, files are
already encrypted. That said, we want to provide some insight into detections that provide
awareness of these activities happening (as well actions one can take to mitigate the risk of
attacks like this).

3/18

With that in mind, we are providing a set of indicators and Splunk searches to help uncover
Kaseya in your environment. If you use Enterprise Security and other Splunk products, take
a look at the “Know thy self” section below for how to scan and determine your networks
susceptibility to this specific attack.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Sophos and Cado Security have both published IOCs for Kaseya. Throw them into a Lookup
table or ES threat intel framework, and off you go! We have converted these indicators into a
simple CSV format to use them as lookup tables - they are posted here.
Additionally, Cado Security has published a sample packet capture (PCAP) file on their
Github repository covering SSL/TLS connections to some of the domains contained in the
IOC data above.

Searches
Huntress has done great work detailing activities that the ransomware code performs, and
we will highlight some of this in our detection searches. From a Splunk detection perspective,
here are some data sets that we always suggest collecting:
Process execution logs from our favorite Windows Security 4688 events, or Sysmon
EventCode 1, or any commercial EDR, are crucial to detecting the processes involved
in actions on intent and lateral movement, amongst other activities.
PowerShell Script Block Logging is also critical to detect certain modules being used
where you don’t expect and the use of encoded PowerShell.
One of its initial endpoint actions is to disable a litany of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
technologies when the ransomware runs. A litany, you say? It will disable accurate time
monitoring, IPS, cloud lookup, script scanning, controlled folder access, network protection,
and stop cloud sample submissions.
It accomplishes this by issuing a PowerShell command to turn these all off, so if you are
monitoring PowerShell scripting, this could be a quick hit if you see all of these protections
being disabled concurrently.
The detection search below requires a configuration in your inputs.conf file to monitor
WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational on the client where your Splunk
Universal Forwarder is installed.
We are only including two of the Defender technologies being turned off in the same
command line for this search. A single technology being turned off could create false
positives by authorized users, but the chances that a second technology being turned off
simultaneously is unlikely to be benign. Notice the wildcards in the Message field so that the
search would still return results in case the order of the technologies is different. One other
4/18

comment here, keep in mind that certain values can be shortened in scripts as well. For
example, -drtm can be used in place of -disablerealtimemonitoring, so flexibility in searches
is key!
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational"
| search Message="*Set-MpPreference -Disable* $true* -Disable* $true*"
| table _time, host, Message

If we wanted to use the specific command found in the ransomware, we could use the
following search instead. This would have the benefit of creating an exact match but
potentially risk missing variants that reorder the technologies in the command itself.
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational"
| search Message="*Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*"
| table _time, host, Message

But wait! I don’t have PowerShell logging set up today. Are there other options to detect this
behavior? Of course! Microsoft Sysmon, Event Code 1 for Process Creation, and Windows
Security Event Code 4688, A new process has been created, are great to use as well.
Here is what the Sysmon Event Code 1 search would look like. Depending on your
configuration, the source and sourcetype might vary slightly. This same logic can be applied
to your EDR platform of choice.

5/18

source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1
cmdline="*powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*"
| table _time, host

Similarly, if you look at process creation in Windows Event logs, your search would look like
this. Depending on your configuration, the source and sourcetype might vary slightly.
source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4688 Process_Command_Line="*powershell.exe
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem
$true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*"
| table _time, host

Windows Defender status is logged to the Application folder in Windows Event Viewer. A
search of the Event Code 15 and the message in the search will indicate when Defender
real-time monitoring has been turned off in the manner of this ransomware. Just because
you see these events does NOT mean you have been infected, but it does indicate that
Defender real-time was turned off, and if the other search options above are not available to
you, this might be a place to start.
source="WinEventLog:Application" EventCode=15 Message="Updated Windows Defender
status successfully to SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED."
| table _time host Message

On the outside chance that you are sending Microsoft-Windows-Windows
Defender/Operational events to Splunk, a search like this will return events from the
Defender application, and the details in the events will show when configurations of these
technologies are changed.
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational" EventCode IN
(5001, 5004, 5007)
| table _time host Message

Along with disabling Defender, an older version (circa 2014) of msmpeng.exe (Defender) is
being used to sideload REvil into the Kaseya agent software. The hash of this older
executable is included in the Github IOC repository listed above.
If you have Sysmon EventCode 7, Image Loaded events, the following search could be
helpful to detect this side-loading of malicious DLLs as well.

6/18

source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=7
Image="*MsMpEng.exe" ImageLoaded="*mpsvc.dll" SHA256 IN
(e2a24ab94f865caeacdf2c3ad015f31f23008ac6db8312c2cbfb32e4a5466ea2,
8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd)

Moving into other process execution activity within the ransomware, GossiTheDog shared a
specific process command line. Here is what that search looks like in both Sysmon and
Window Events, with the same caveats mentioned above.
source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=1
cmdline="c:\\kworking\\agent.exe*"
| table _time, host, cmdline
source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4688
Process_Command_Line="c:\\kworking\\agent.exe*"
| table _time, host, Process_Command_Line

Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk SOAR, and Enterprise Security
Content Updates (ESCU)
Know Thyself
While we have spent some time explaining this attack and effort needs to be put toward
investigating this, it is also important to remember that the foundational elements of cybersecurity, such as asset management, are as crucial as ever. When performed well via your
asset and identity framework, you can quickly identify where your vulnerable systems reside.
Running regular vulnerability scans that integrate into Splunk will display which systems are
vulnerable and can help you prioritize your patching schedule and better focus your detection
efforts. In the case of ransomware, knowing which assets to protect or are impacted as
quickly as possible can be key to your defense strategy.
While the details of the vulnerability in the Kaseya software have not been detailed, it
appears that the CVE-2021-30116 will be utilized, and as vulnerability assessment solutions
update their platforms, searching for this vulnerability will be essential to understand future
exposure to this attack vector.

MITRE ATT&CK
After reviewing dozens of blogs and reviewing the MITRE ATT&CK team’s review of REvil
we pulled all of our content that maps to the MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and listed them in a nice
table below. Be aware; these searches are provided as a way to accelerate your hunting. We
recommend you configure them via the Splunk Security Essentials App. You may need to
modify them to work in your environment! Many of these searches are optimized for use with
the tstats command. Some of these are so new they are coming straight out of the Splunk
Threat Research Team’s repo! Please note that not all of these will be 100% relevant to
Kaseya or REvil, but more information is better than none. For detailed information on
detecting REvil, make sure to read the upcoming Splunk Threat Research Team’s blog on
REvil ransomware.
Finally, as more information becomes available, we will update these searches if more
ATT&CK TTPs become known. Pay special attention to the Splunk searches that are
BOLDED and have (NEW) with them… the STRT freshly creates these to help you with
REvil. For our complete reading list, check our bibliography at the end of the blog)

rcanary is a little something extra...
In an attempt to get my boss off my back, I told James Brodsky that he should “create a TA
that detects files being encrypted.” Of course, he took me seriously and went off and created
“TA-rcanary.” This TA uses fschange, a deprecated feature of the Splunk UF (which still
works), to monitor a single randomly named .docx file in a hidden directory on the Windows
filesystem. Upon the first run, the .docx file is created in this directory. Then, a fschange entry
is added to the inputs.conf, and every 15 seconds, this file is monitored for any changes. If
any changes occur to it (copy of it, delete it, rename it, etc.), an event is generated and
indexed in Splunk, as shown below. Keep in mind that this is a very new TA and will probably
need some changes, but if it helps, you have “Splunkspiration” and detects some encrypted
files… all the better!

Conclusion
We know that many of you are coming to this blog not because you were impacted directly
by the Kaseya ransomware incident but because you are worried that you might be affected
in the future. Hopefully, the content above will provide you with searches that give you the
ability to have more visibility into your environment and detect (and we hope it never does) a
ransomware outbreak in your network. If they don’t work perfectly, think of them as
“SplunkSpiration” :-).

15/18

We will update this blog and add new content as needed over the next week, but keep your
eyes peeled for the upcoming publication on REvil ransomware by the Splunk Threat
Research team. Furthermore, Splunk will be developing significantly more content this month
around ransomware. Workshops, webinars, Twitter Spaces, and much more, so watch out
for those coming soon.
Finally, even though this blog primarily focused on ransomware, the more significant concern
is that this attack appears to be propagated via the software supply chain of the victims. We
recognize what a big deal this is and have dedicated sessions at October’s .conf21 around
this very topic. If you are new to Supply Chain attacks and want to learn how to defend your
org against things like SolarWinds or Kaseya, consider attending my talk with Marcus
LaFerrerra, “Hunting the known unknown: Supply Chain Attacks” (SEC-1745). If you are a
defender whose company builds software, I’d suggest attending “Securing the software
factory with Splunk” (SEC-1108) by Dave Herrald and Chris Riley. No matter what you do, I
hope that you could get some enjoyment this weekend and weren’t chained to the desk like
we were. As always, happy hunting :-)
And one more thing: As we’ve stated before, this blog ain’t the first time we’re covering our
