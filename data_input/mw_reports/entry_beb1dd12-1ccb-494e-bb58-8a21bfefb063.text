ServHelper is a recently discovered backdoor associated with TA505. A veteran threat group
that has also been associated with the infamous Dridex banking malware, the
GlobeIimposter ransomware, and other high-profile malware campaigns.
Deep Instinct Threat Research unit has recently discovered a new variant of ServHelper that
employes an Excel 4.0 macro Dropper. A legacy mechanism still supported by Microsoft
Office, and an executable payload signed with a valid digital signature.
Since this vector came to light it has gained some traction, although it is still not widespread
and is used by only a handful of threat actors.

Attack Flow
Once the malicious Excel sheet is opened the Excel 4.0 macro is executed and msiexec.exe
is called in order to download and execute the payload.

ServHelper’s payload, an NSIS Installer signed with a valid digital signature (further details
on the certificate ahead), is downloaded by msiexec.exe to its temporary folder
(C:\Windows\Installer\MSI[4-charachter-string].tmp) and executed.
Once the dropped payload is executed, it will drop a DLL file contained in the installer to
\%TEMP%\xmlparse.dll, and use rundll32.exe to call the DLL’s exported function “sega”.

xmlparse.dll’s exported functions,

functions 1-3 are Delphi compiler artifacts, function 4 is not currently used.[/caption]
The malware will then write a base64 encoded PowerShell script (which is contained in
xmlparse.dll as a resource) to \%TEMP%\enu1.ps1 and execute it. The script, intended for
reconnaissance purposes, checks if a machine is part of a domain and if the user has Admin
privileges or is part of the Admin Group.

This information is then reported back to ServHelper’s Command & Control server and if the
user is part of a domain, the Command & Control server will also instruct the malware to
gather a list of other users in the domain.

Command & Control server

response with command to gather a list of users in the domain[/caption]
ServHelper can receive several types of commands from its Command & Control server,
including:
shell – execute a shell (cmd.exe) command and return its output
loaddll –download a DLL file and load it using rundll32.exe
persist – write an auto-run registry entry at
HK_CU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ as “Intel Protect”, returns
“persistence established” if successful.
slp – enter sleep mode

selfkill – remove the malware from the infected machine

Signed Payload and Core
Both the NSIS Installer payload and ServHelper’s core DLL are, at the time of writing, signed
using a valid signature.

ServHelper signed using a valid

signature[/caption]
The certificate used to sign the malware was issued to “MASLAK LTD” of Uxbridge, Great
Britain.
While this appears to be a legitimately registered company, further investigation is required to
determine the validity of the certificates or whether they have been compromised and the
possibility of MASLAK being a shell company.
Our analysis of “MASLAK LTD” certificates reveals another certificate issued by them that
was previously used to digitally sign malware, although it has since been revoked (certificate
details are provided in the IOCs section).
Conclusion
TA505 is a highly advanced global threat actor. It employs a vast array of sophisticated,
constantly developed malware for different purposes, for which it exploits the most recently
discovered and publicized weak points.
5/7

This, factually, pays off for TA505. The evasive and legitimatizing factors described above,
whereby a dropper employs a lesser known and poorly detected old-school technique
combined with a validly signed payload and malware core, all contribute to its evasiveness.
When this variant first appeared on VirusTotal it was almost completely undetected. Below
are links to each component’s initial detections at time of upload:

Deep Instinct Threat Research contacted DigiCert (who operate Thawte CA), and was
notified that an investigation into the malicious certificate has been initiated.
Deep Instinct’s customers are fully protected against ServHelper’s activity based on D-Brain
– Deep Instinct’s Deep Learning security solution.
Update (4/4/19):
Following conclusion of our initial analysis of the described ServHelper variant, Deep Instinct
has noticed an uptick in ServHelper’s activity, with new droppers and infection URLs
appearing in the wild, a new mildly modified payload and core signed with the same
certificate, and an additional Command & Control domain (new indicators have been
updated in IOC section).
Deep Instinct has been notified by DigiCert that following Deep Instinct’s report, the
certificate used in this ServHelper campaign has been revoked.
