BRATISLAVA, BUENOS AIRES – ESET researchers have recently discovered a previously
undocumented botnet named VictoryGate. It has been active since at least May 2019, and
is composed mainly of devices in Peru, where over 90% of the infected devices are located.
The main activity of the botnet is mining Monero cryptocurrency. The victims include
organizations in both public and private sectors, including financial institutions. Thanks to
data obtained during this research and shared with the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation,
at least a portion of the botnet operation has been disrupted.
ESET researchers have been “sinkholing” several domain names that control the botnet’s
actions, replacing them with machines that do not send the botnet’s slave computers the
commands they expect, but simply monitor botnet activity. Based on this data and ESET
telemetry, ESET estimates that at least 35,000 devices became infected with VictoryGate at
one point or another during this campaign.
The only infection vector used for spreading VictoryGate is via removable devices. “The
victim receives a USB drive that at some point was connected to an infected machine. It
seemingly has all the files with the same names and icons that it contained before being
infected. Because of this, the content will look almost identical at first glance. However, all
the original files were replaced by a copy of the malware,” says ESET researcher Alan
Warburton, who investigated the botnet. “When an unsuspecting user attempts to open one
of these files, the script will open both the file that was intended and the malicious
payload.”
Warburton also warns about the impact on victims’ machines: “There is very high resource
usage by the botnet, resulting in a constant 90% to 99% CPU load. This slows down the
device and can cause overheating and possible damage.”
According to ESET research, VictoryGate has made a much greater effort to avoid
detection than in previous, similar campaigns observed in the Latam region. And, given the
fact that the botmaster can update functionality of the payloads that are downloaded and

executed on the infected devices from cryptomining to any other malicious activities at any
given time, this poses a considerable risk. This is particularly true since many of the victims
identified were in either the public sector or in financial institutions.
If you suspect your device may have been infected with this malware, you can use our
