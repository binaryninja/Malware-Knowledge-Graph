BELLEVILLE, Wis. — Drive past the dairy farms, cornfields and horse pastures here and you
will eventually arrive at Cate Machine & Welding, a small-town business run by Gene and
Lori Cate and their sons. For 46 years, the Cates have welded many things — fertilizer
tanks, jet-fighter parts, cheese molds, even a farmer’s broken glasses.
And like many small businesses, they have a dusty old computer humming away in the back
office. On this one, however, an unusual spy-versus-spy battle is playing out: The machine
has been taken over by Chinese hackers.
The hackers use it to plan and stage attacks. But unbeknown to them, a Silicon Valley startup is tracking them here, in real time, watching their every move and, in some cases,
blocking their efforts.
“When they first told us, we said, ‘No way,’” Mr. Cate said one afternoon recently over pizza
and cheese curds, recalling when he first learned the computer server his family used to
manage its welding business had been secretly repurposed. “We were totally freaked out,”
Ms. Cate said. “We had no idea we could be used as an infiltration unit for Chinese attacks.”

On a recent Thursday, the hackers’ targets appeared to be a Silicon Valley food delivery
start-up, a major Manhattan law firm, one of the world’s biggest airlines, a prominent
Southern university and a smattering of targets across Thailand and Malaysia. The New York
Times viewed the action on the Cates’ computer on the condition that it not name the targets.
The activity had the hallmarks of Chinese hackers known as the C0d0s0 group, a collection
of hackers for hire that the security industry has been tracking for years. Over the years, the
group has breached banks, law firms and tech companies, and once hijacked the Forbes
website to try to infect visitors’ computers with malware.
There is a murky and much hyped emerging industry in selling intelligence about attack
groups like the C0d0s0 group. Until recently, companies typically adopted a defensive
strategy of trying to make their networks as impermeable as possible in hopes of repelling
attacks. Today, so-called threat intelligence providers sell services that promise to go on the
offensive. They track hackers, and for annual fees that can climb into the seven figures, they
try to spot and thwart attacks before they happen.
These companies have a mixed record of success. Still, after years of highly publicized
incidents, Gartner, a market research company, expects the market for threat intelligence to
reach $1 billion next year, up from $255 million in 2013.
Remarkably, many attacks rely on a tangled maze of compromised computers including
those mom-and-pop shops like Cate Machine & Welding. The hackers aren’t after the Cates’
data. Rather, they have converted their server, and others like it, into launchpads for their
attacks.
These servers offer the perfect cover. They aren’t terribly well protected, and rarely, if ever,
do the owners discover that their computers have become conduits for spies and digital
thieves. And who would suspect the Cate family?
Two years ago, the Cates received a visit from men informing them that their server had
become a conduit for Chinese spies. The Cates asked: “Are you from the N.S.A.?”

One of the men had, in fact, worked at the National Security Agency years before joining a
start-up company, Area 1, that focuses on tracking digital attacks against businesses. “It’s
like being a priest,” said Blake Darché, Area 1’s chief security officer, of his N.S.A.
background. “In other people’s minds, you never quite leave the profession.”
Mr. Darché wanted to add the Cates’ server to Area 1’s network of 50 others that had been
co-opted by hackers. Area 1 monitors the activity flowing into and out of these computers to
glean insights into attackers’ methods, tools and websites so that it can block them from

hitting its clients’ networks, or give them a heads-up days, weeks or even months before they
hit.
The Cates called a family meeting. “People work really hard to make products, and they’re
getting stolen,” Ms. Cate said. “It seemed like the least we could do.” Area 1 paid for the
installation cost, about $150.
Shortly after installing a sensor on the machine, Mr. Darché said his hunch was confirmed:
The sensor lit up with attacks. Area 1 began to make out the patterns of a familiar adversary:
the C0d0s0 group.
Area 1 was founded by three former N.S.A. analysts, Mr. Darché, Oren Falkowitz and Phil
Syme. The three sat side by side at Fort Meade, tracking and, in some cases, penetrating
adversaries’ weapons systems for intelligence. A little over two years ago, they decided to
start their own company and raised $25.5 million in funding from major venture capitalists
and security entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, including Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers and
Cowboy Ventures, and security veterans like Ray Rothrock, the chief executive of RedSeal,
and Derek Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security.
Area 1 is a new player in threat intelligence, a nascent subsector of the security business
that includes companies like iSight Partners and Recorded Future that track attackers in
underground web forums and on social media, gleaning intelligence about them.
Threat intelligence is still more art than science. The jury is still out on whether companies
are equipped to use that intelligence to thwart hackers. Area 1 claims that it can head off
attacks through the compromised servers it is tracking. It can also use its vantage point to
see where attackers are setting up shop on the web and how they plan to target their
intended victims.
A handful of Area 1 customers confirmed that its technology had helped head off attackers.
One client, a chief information security officer at a large health care provider, said the health
care sector had been slammed by digital criminals and governments in recent years. He
asked that the company not be named, to avoid becoming a more visible target.
He credited Area 1’s sensors with blocking several attacks on his network, helping his
company avoid the fates of the health insurer Anthem, which was breached by Chinese
hackers last year, and a growing number of hospitals hit by attacks that have forced them to
pay a ransom to get important information back.
Mr. Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security, said Area 1 gave his company warning of
three attacks before they happened, providing time to block them. Mr. Smith said he was
impressed enough that he made a small investment in Area 1.

“Many of these mom-and-pop shops are ambivalent because the attacks don’t directly
impact their business and revenue,” he said. “Meanwhile, they unwittingly operate this attack
infrastructure.”
But Area 1’s business model can pose ethical dilemmas. What does the company do when it
sees attacks against prominent companies and government agencies who are not Area 1
customers?
“We think of ourselves as a bodyguard, not a police force that runs around telling everyone
they’re a victim,” said Mr. Falkowitz, Area 1’s chief executive. “We’re in the business of preemption.”

They do warn some victims, he said. For instance, they tipped off a law firm, a manufacturer,
a financial services firm and electronics company that were attacked via the Cates’ server
after they saw the C0d0s0 hackers make off with their intellectual property. Some of those
victims, including the law firm, later signed up for Area 1 services.
Not all companies heed the warning. A security consultant for one victim, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements, said that his client chose not
to act on a tip from Area 1 last year out of concern that a scandal over a successful online
attack against the company would jeopardize its recent acquisition. It figured its acquirer
would not have been thrilled to learn that the start-up’s proprietary technology was now in
Chinese hacker’s hands.
Posted on the wall of Area 1’s headquarters in a historic house in Redwood City, Calif., is a
list titled “45 Things That Are Harder Than Cybersecurity.” It includes flight, solar power, the
flu vaccine, brain surgery, the internet, heart transplants, skyscrapers, the Thermos and the
Q-tip.
Mr. Falkowitz disagrees with a growing concern that it is too difficult or impossible to stop
online attacks. As attackers have grown more sophisticated, many security companies have
stopped believing they can block attacks with traditional defenses like antivirus software.
Instead, many focus on trying to detect an intrusion “in real time,” to catch hackers before
they steal too much.
Eighty percent of the time, victims learn they have been breached only when law
enforcement or someone else shows up with their stolen data, according to Verizon, which
tracks breach data.
At the N.S.A., Mr. Falkowitz had worked with teams that detected North Korean missile
launches. Much of that early work was done with satellites that would look for sudden heat
blasts.

Eventually, Mr. Falkowitz’s team tried a more proactive approach. If they could hack the
computers that controlled the missile launch systems, they could glean launch schedules.
Area 1 is now taking a similar approach to digital attacks, tapping into the attackers’
launchpads, as it were, rather than waiting for them to attack.
Hackers don’t just press a big red “attack” button one day. They do reconnaissance, scout
out employees on LinkedIn, draft carefully worded emails to trick unsuspecting employees to
open them and click on links or email attachments that will try to launch malicious attacks.
Once they persuade a target to click — and 91 percent of attacks start this way, according to
Trend Micro, the security firm — it takes time to crawl through a victim’s network to find
something worth taking. Then they have to pull that data off the network. The process can
take weeks, months, even years and leaves a digital trail.
Area 1 watches for this kind of activity and then teams up with firms like Blue Coat, a web
security company, to build what it has learned into security software that can try to block
attacks when they come.
The owners of Cate Machine & Welding say that living with Chinese attackers in your office
can be a strange feeling. Recently, Area 1 executives visited the shop and showed them
some of what they had learned from watching their computer. The C0d0s0 group had used
their server to pilfer a law firm’s due diligence on an impending acquisition, a financial
services firm’s confidential trading plans, a mobile payment start-up’s proprietary source
code, some blueprints and loan applications at a mortgage company.
Hearing that, Mr. Cate expressed pride — and maybe even a hint of schadenfreude. For
years, the welding business that is his family’s bread and butter has been migrating to China.
Now his family is helping American businesses fight back.
“We want to do the right thing for these businesses,” Mr. Cate said, “For our country.”
