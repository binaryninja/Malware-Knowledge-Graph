DarkSide Group Background
DarkSide is an emerging RaaS (ransomware as a service) criminal group. The group may be organized by other former branches of
ransomware activities. According to the attack rules announced by the group, the group only target The medical, government, education, nonprofit organizations, and organizations outside the funeral and interment industry launched blackmail attacks. The ransomware family first
appeared in August 2020, up to now, 81 companies have been publicly attacked by the ransomware family.

Related important attacks
On April 20, 2021, the DarkSide group issued an announcement on its dark web site, claiming that it invaded many companies listed on the
Nasdaq and other stock exchanges, and encrypted the core data of related companies. If the related companies refuse to pay the ransom, The
group is preparing to publish the stolen data and make a profit from the short-selling options of related companies.

On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline provider in the United States, encountered a targeted attack by the DarkSide
group, forcing it to shut down the key fuel network that supplies fuel to the densely populated eastern states of the United States.

Technical characteristics of the attack
According to the analysis of the historical attack data of the DarkSide group, the attack characteristics of the group are different from other
ransomware groups. A large amount of data will be stolen before the ransomware attack is released and installed against related
organizations. It also created a distributed storage system in Iran, which is used to store victim data.

The main attack features of the Darkside Group:
Ransomware mainly targets Windows systems, but there are also variants for Linux systems;
Use a large number of penetration testing tools to perform vulnerability scanning and intrusion penetration against the external network
systems of relevant organizations;
After entering the intranet of the relevant organization, it will attack the Windows domain controller in an attempt to control the entire
enterprise intranet;
The core data of the stolen organization will be uploaded to the private cloud distributed storage system;
After controlling the core assets of the organization, the installation of the ransomware attack was finally carried out.
Darkside’s extortion notice is tailored specifically for companies, and will specifically target companies’ accounting data, execution data, sales
data, customer support data, marketing data, and other core value data for stealing and extorting attacks.

Core Ransomware Analysis
The DarkSide ransomware virus will check to see if the current user is an administrator when it is first launched:

After starting to run, an icon will be released in the AppData\Local directory as the icon of the encrypted file. At the same time, the file name of
the icon is also the file suffix added after the ransomware encrypted file (each sample is different, the current sample is “.82a71c82”)

2/6

The virus will inject the current user name, computer name and other information encrypted and sent to the C2 server. The URL during the test
is:
hxxp://securebestapp20.com/mhzPjMHjEl

Call system powershell to execute commands:
powershell -ep bypass -c “”(0..61)|%{$s+=[char][byte]
(‘0x’+’4765742D576D694F626A6563742057696E33325F536861646F77636F7079207C20466F72456163682D4F626A656374207B245F2E44656
“”

After unpacking the string, the actual command is to delete the Windows system shadow operation:
Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}
After the preparation work is completed, the virus starts two threads to encrypt files in a loop.

3/6

The ransomware uses the Salsa20 algorithm to encrypt the victim’s data, and then uses the RSA-1024 algorithm to encrypt the Salsa20 key
and put it at the end of the file.

In the end, the virus will modify the user’s desktop background and leave a blackmail message asking the victim to contact himself to pay the
ransom.

Group association traceability analysis
DarkSide group members once posted DarkSide-related ransomware information on well-known Russian forums.

The ransomware virus will determine the default language of the system. If it is a Russian language, it will not encrypt system files.

Judging from the comprehensive technical characteristics and historical activities, the gang is a typical RaaS (Extortion as a Service) criminal
gang, and a large number of Russian-speaking personnel are suspected.
Security Advices to Enterprise Customers
The processing flow after the ransomware attack is discovered:
1. If an infected machine is found, its network and the computer should be shut down immediately. Closing the network can prevent the
ransomware from spreading laterally on the intranet, and shutting down the computer can prevent the ransomware from continuing to
encrypt files in time;
2. Contact security vendor to investigate and deal with the internal network;
3. The passwords of all machines in the company should be changed. You cannot be sure how many passwords of the machines inside the
company are mastered by the hacker.
Protective measures after being attacked by ransomware:
1. Contact the security vendor to investigate and deal with the internal network;
2. The login password should be of sufficient length and complexity, and the login password should be changed regularly;
3. The shared folder of important information should be set to access permission control and be backed up regularly;
4. Regularly detect security vulnerabilities in the system and software, and apply patches in time;
5. The login password should be of sufficient length and complexity, and the login password should be changed regularly;
6. The shared folder of important information should be set to access permission control and be backed up regularly;
7. Regularly detect security vulnerabilities in the system and software, and apply patches in time.
