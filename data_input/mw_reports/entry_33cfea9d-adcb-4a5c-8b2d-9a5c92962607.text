resources. Phosphorus typically attempts to compromise the personal (not work) accounts of th
targeted individ al through a technique known as “spear phishing ” Spear phi hing attack
conducted in the following fashion: After researching a victim organization the spear phisher

‘Il identify individuals associated with that organization throu h gathering publicly available

ensuing communications exchanges are used to social engineer information identify additional

created fake social networking profiles to carry out such an attack

Another technique utilized by Phosphorus is to send a targeted individual an emai

Phosphorus can also download a copy of the victim address book to be used for future targeting

Customers expect Microsoft to provide safe and trustworthy products and services There 1s a
great risk that Microsoft’s customers both individuals and the nterprises for which they work
may incorrectly attribute these problems to Microsoft’s products and services, thereby dilutin
and tarnishing th value of these trademarks and brands.

Phosphorus sends these emails from a variety of online email services. As
discussed above there are multiple Phosphorus created domain mimicking Microsoft brands
and those domains are clearly designed to be included in spear phishing emails as links to

ebsites that Phosphorus ha up in advance and which they control. When a victim click on
he link in the email his or her computer is connected with the Phosphorus-controlled websit  |
