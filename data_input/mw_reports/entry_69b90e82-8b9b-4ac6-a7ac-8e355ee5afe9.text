Exposing and Analyzing Negotiations with the CONTI Group and Wallets
Associated with the Ransomware
Preface
During our routine monitoring of ransomware groups, we detected a sample of the CONTI ransomware uploaded to
Virus Total from Canada. ClearSky and Whitestream were able to access the entire negotiation process between the
company and the extortion group in real time by analyzing the sample. Furthermore, we succeeded in following the
ransom payment, tracking all of the involved bitcoin blockchain transactions. The revealed bitcoin transactions
allowed us to associate CONTI with Wizard Spider, as Ryuk was previously associated with the group. This association
confirms the common theory that CONTI and Ryuk are connected. Following the negotiations closely assists in learning
how to properly engage with the attackers, managing the most sensitive part of a ransomware attack.

Short Background on the Conti Ransomware Group
Originated by the ‘Wizard Spider’ Russian hacking group, CONTI ransomware is an evolution of one of the group’s most
successful ransomware – Ryuk. CONTI is a more accessible version of Ryuk, built for distribution by affiliates in a
‘Ransomware as a service’ model. CONTI ransomware was first spotted by cybersecurity teams in May 2020 and claim
to have over 150 successful extortion attacks by the end of 2020, with at least $20M in revenues paid by the victims.

During our routine monitoring of ransomware groups, we detected a sample of CONTI ransomware uploaded to Virus
Total from Canada. From analyzing the sample, we were able to track all negotiations between the company and the
extortion group. Furthermore, we succeeded in following the bitcoin transactions of the paid ransom.

We estimate that during the coming months many companies will be targeted by this group, suggesting that analyzing
the negotiations, as an indication to CONTI’s behavioral patterns, should prove beneficial when facing future attacks.
Analyzing the sample allowed us to reach CONTI’s website, in which the attackers were negotiating with a victim in real
time (a Canadian energy company).
This article surveys and analyses the correspondence, providing insights regarding some of the negotiation methods
employed. It is apparent that the Canadian company was initiated represented by an executive, who was replaced
after approximately 6 days by a professional negotiator who led the communication towards an agreement.
We have several insights from the correspondence. We want to thank Moty Cristal from NEST, who reviewed and added
insights:
-

The blackmailer uses service-oriented rhetoric, attempting to create a false pretense of a supplier and
customer debating a legitimate deal: the attacker addresses the victim as “customer”, and themselves as
“support”. The attacker presents the attack as an issue that arose regardless of their illegitimate involvement,
with them offering security and decryption services. The attacker leads the victim to a user interface that seems
professionally established for customer management and support.

-

Clear negotiation rhetoric: both the attacker and the victim are skilled and professional negotiation personnel,
exhibiting experience in engaging with this sort of correspondence. Both sides speak “negotiations” fluently
while respecting the conversation’s limits and rules. The negotiations language is completely businessoriented, aiming to close a deal expeditiously. A pattern which is commonly seen by “Ivy league” attack groups:
structured, reputational, technologically advanced and ransom-industry oriented.

-

The necessity of haggling: like in other businesses, the attacker sets a nigh-impossible payment (“anchoring”)
requirement as negotiations initiate. However, during the correspondence the attacker lowers the price,
showing flexibility towards the victim. It is safe to assume that the attackers know what the organization can
afford before negotiations begin, considering the extent of intelligence gathering that commonly precedes
targeted ransomware attacks (including the organization’s size and income). As the correspondence begins, it
is apparent that the negotiator representing the victim is aware of the attackers’ methods, as they request the
documents used to calculate the ransom. It is inevitable that in this case the CONTI team has chosen, for certain
reasons, the “haggling” method, rather than using a “take-it-or-leave-it” method, which characterizes less
sophisticated threat actors.

-

At this point, it appears that patience pays off: the negotiations were initiated in 30.12.2020, lasting up until
19.01.2021: the holiday season in the Western world as well as in the Christian Orthodox cultures. A factor that
added to the morale of both sides. Both sides exhibit patience while conducting the correspondence. It
appears that the nature of the stolen files and the level by which the organization was disabled are the main
causes for the exhibited patience.

Locating and Accessing the Negotiations
Background
During January 21, a CONTI sample was detected by us in VirusTotal. The sample was detected and signed by
numerous AV engines:

One of the associated files was the ransom message, ordering the company to enter the contirecovery[.]best website
and establish communications with the attacker. The message entails a unique victim identifier.

A message containing a unique identifier is routine in ransomware proceedings. We entered CONTI’s website to identify
the victim, which displayed an interface requesting the ransom message to begin communicating with the attackers.

Analyzing the Correspondence
The correspondence is conducted between the ransomware operators (referring to themselves as “Support”) and the
victim company’s appointed negotiation handler (referring to themselves as “Amy Lynn”). The full correspondence is
added at the end of this document.
The conversation begins with a generic-seeming message from “Support” in which they define their demands and the
rules of the negotiations directly. Their upfront statement: “Are you ready to negotiate?” serves as a undoubtable
invitation to a “haggling game”. The attackers explains that the victim’s stolen and encrypted files will only be
decrypted if the $8.5 million ransom is paid in full. The attacker continues to state that they will release their hold of
the organization once the ransom is paid, adding security advice to better protect the organization in the future. The
attackers threaten to leak the stolen files publicly in the ransom is not paid.

The victim expresses surprise when confronted with the high ransom demand, doubting the attackers’ credibility. Using
an authentic language of “That’s a crazy price”, could hint that the first handler of these negotiations on behalf of the
victim is not a professional negotiator.
The attackers offer to decrypt two files free of charge to prove their intentions. Following this, the attacker provides the
company’s income report for 2020 to justify the ransom amount. The victim explains that the company’s income does
not represent its profits, invalidating the ransom calculation.

As the correspondence continues the victim requests proof for several random files to further prove the attackers’
credibility. Once the attacker provides the files, they also send a list of all the stolen files, implying their credibility by
offering the victim to choose any file for decryption.

The victim attempts to verify the attacker’s credibility even further, requesting that the attackers share the method by
which they stole over 1TB from the organization. The attacker succinctly explains the compression system that allowed
them to compress the stolen information by more than 95%. Quickly changing the subject, the attacker returns to
negotiate, and states that if the victim pays the ransom, an explanation as to preventing this sort of attack will be
provided. The victim tests the attackers limits again by asking for proof that the information will not be sold after the
ransom is paid.

One of the correspondence segments entails the attacker explaining that refraining from upholding the agreed upon
conditions contrasts their interests, as their reputation will be harmed (also harming future negotiations), an argument
commonly used by “leading members” in the ransomware industry.

Once the victim is convinced, they explain that the company does not possess the funds to pay the demanded ransom.
The attacker suggests that the victim takes a loan. The victim, probably at that point led by a professional negotiator,
explains that the company does not require decryption, and as a negotiation tactic “frames” a possible deal and
“anchors-back” for $250,000 solely to prevent information leakage.

The next morning, at 11:00 AM, the attacker replies. They are prepared to lower the initial blackmail demand by 70%,
to $2,125,000. The conversation enters another hiatus.

The conversation is renewed as the weekend ends. The victim informs the attacker that the possible damage that may
be caused by the stolen documents in not estimated by millions of dollars. The victim’s negotiator states that the

company cannot pay the demanded ransom and maintain the haggling dance by stating that they are prepared to
immediately transfer $400,000 if the attackers will compromise further. The attackers “consult with their bosses” and
informs the victim that the group decided to lower the ransom to $600,000, providing insights regarding the breach,
deleting the files from the attackers’ network, and potentially uploading the encrypted files to mega.nz.

The negotiations are somewhat derailed as the victim requests confirmation that a decryption key will be provided
alongside the agreed upon terms. The attacker explains that maybe they have misunderstood, but the conversation
thus far concluded that the victim does not need to decrypt their files.
The victim attempts to facilitate another decrease of the ransom, which the attacker apparently does not appreciate.
The attackers’ tone changes, seemingly becoming more aggressive, stating that the victim’s “tricks” will not succeed.
The attackers advise avoiding basing terms on previously reported deals with the CONTI group, as 75% of their
transactions were not reported publicly. The attackers set an ultimatum – the victim has one day to decide whether
they want to pay $600,000 for the files, or a higher price for the entire package.

It appears that the victim realizes that they crossed a line in attempting to decrease the price further. Despite this, they
insist on $450,000 as the final amount, explaining that they are unable to pay more. Using professional communication
methods the negotiator manages to successfully convey the message that this $450,000 is an authentic “reservation
value”. A number beyond which the victim prefers the “no-deal” alternative.
The attackers agree to a final act of compromise, stating that they will consult with their “boss” once again to attempt
and convince them to include file decryption in the $600,000 offer. The victim emphasizes that an offer including
decryption will be seriously considered.

In 20/1/21 450,000 US$ were paid to Conti.

Blockchain Analysis
Analysis of the CONTI Ransomware’s Affiliate Bitcoin Wallet
Tracking the $450,000 ransom payment on the Blockchain indicates that the CONTI’s affiliates deposited some of their
funds to Binance.com digital currency exchange, and to Rocketr.net, a Bitcoin payments platform. Another significant
amount was transferred to one of Wizard Spider’s main Bitcoin wallets, probably as part of the revenue sharing frame.

Blockchain analysis reveals the connection between CONTI and Ryuk.
Analyzing the ‘Wizard Spider’ group Bitcoin wallets indicated that several Bitcoin addresses serve as a major hub in
collecting the ransom payments from the victims. Ransom payments from Both Ryuk and CONTI victims were delivered
to the same Bitcoin wallets that are managed by the ‘Wizard Spider’ group during the last three years.

excessive for this type of data and we don't have much need for a decryptor. Our proposal is
$250,000.
06/01/2021, 21:48:08

Support: That is way lower than your abilities and not as relevant to our expectations as we
thought. Although I will pas your offer to my boss and get back to you.

to work this through and the fact that you don't need the decryption tool I've managed to
convince my boss to provide you the huge discount by going down to $2125000 (70%
discount). If we close the deal this way we have to intention to sell or publish your data of
course.

Amy Lynn: We're connecting on this topic later today and tomorrow morning. We may be able
to increase the dollar amount.

12/01/2021, 10:45:38

Support: Ok, will be waiting for further details

13/01/2021, 00:32:48

Amy Lynn: We have reviewed the data and while the files contain company information, they
will not cause millions in damage. Even if they did, we'd have to live with that because we are
on a tight budget in 2021. However, we think there is some value with your cooperation and
we're prepared to pay $400,000 immediately. We can work out the details if you want to make
a profit. Otherwise, we may be out of opportunities.

13/01/2021, 01:38:56

Support: We will discuss internally and get back to you soon.

13/01/2021, 10:13:13

Amy Lynn: great, ok thank you.
Support: We've discussed, despite the fact that my boss considers our last offer reasonable I
managed to convince him to review it. He agreed to go down to $600k if the deal will be closed
by the end of this week. Once the transfer is made you will be provided with security
recommendations on network improvement, breach details, all you files will be completely
wiped from our servers once and for all. Also we can upload your files to mega.nz secure share
and provide you with full access to it. That's a fair offer and I did everything possible to make
it work. Hope you appreciate.

13/01/2021, 12:58:09

Amy Lynn: We do appreciate that but we'll need to discuss since it's more money than what
we have at the moment. Before we discuss, can you also confirm that we would receive a
decryption tool in addition to the above deliverables?

Support: As I remember you do not need a decryption tool. Am I mistaken? Most of the
discount was provided based on the fact that you do not need the decryption.

13/01/2021, 22:08:47

Amy Lynn: There are some files that would save us time. $400,000 is not a small amount.

13/01/2021, 22:16:03

Support: That is way below our offer. Yes, surely the decryptor would save you some time, and
time means money. The $600k offer was for the data we hold. As you must understand we
have some experience in negotiations, and you are trying to put us in the position that you
think we accept, based on the basic information that is in the the press about usual sum we
get. Relying on the press or public opinion is a mistake. About 75% of our deals are never
leaked to the public or revealed. We will be waiting for your decision by tomorrow. $600k for
the files or something better for full pack.

13/01/2021, 22:27:04

Amy Lynn: Yes, we know you are very experienced. We can sense it. All we're doing is seeing
how much money we can spend, and $400,000 is an large sum. If we go down this path, then
we certainly want all of the items that are available.

14/01/2021, 00:28:14

Amy Lynn: We've read about you in the press but we have no idea about the usual sum that
you get. No one here wants to play games, and that's why we're trying to finalize the
deliverables in advance. We want a solution and we assume you want to get paid. But
$400,000 is only available if we can get everything. How else can we afford to pay that much?

14/01/2021, 00:30:33

Support: The $400k is too low anyways. I will talk to my boss and try to get an offer for $600k
that will contain the decryptor. Give me few hours.

14/01/2021, 07:24:58

Amy Lynn: Alright - your best offer that includes the decryptor will be taken under very serious
consideration. Thank you.

14/01/2021, 09:58:23

Support: Talked to my boss. When he heard about the decryption tool being needed, at first
he was ready to move back to the previous offer or at least move to 1.2mil (x2 from the data
offer), but we've decided not too be hard on you and are ready to stay at $750k. Take this to
the management and let me know what they decide.

14/01/2021, 15:57:30

Amy Lynn: I appreciate you trying. We have a lot of money set aside for this but $750,000 just
won't be possible. If the price was $600,000 then we may have been able to push closer to
that. But at $750,000, it is just so far...

14/01/2021, 17:02:47

Support: We can leave it $600k if the transfer will be done today or tomorrow.

14/01/2021, 17:05:00

14/01/2021, 17:10:31

Amy Lynn: Let me discuss with the team. This is still above our budget but we can try to work
towards it quickly. Thanks.

15/01/2021, 00:51:32

Amy Lynn: We took this management and discussed. They were certainly appreciative of you
being able to include the decryptor in the $600,000 price. While the price itself is still high for
us, we feel more confident in being able to move past this with you. We may be paying more
than the value, but want to keep the positivity in our discussions. As a result, we can increase
our offer to $450,000 and can begin the transfer soon if you are with us. Thank you.
Support: $600k. take it back.

15/01/2021, 02:23:42

Support: And the sum will be increased if we will not receive the funds within mentioned time
frames.

15/01/2021, 02:24:47

Amy Lynn: Well, increasing the sum is not going to get us any closer. I will get back to you in a
bit.

15/01/2021, 09:44:07

Amy Lynn: We had an early morning call. $450,000 is our limit and this is more than what we
anticipated paying. We can start the payment process soon if you can agree. Otherwise, this
may not be the ending we had hoped for.

15/01/2021, 15:06:43

Amy Lynn: We know you worked hard to make this work and we appreciate it. It's just that
we're at our limit.

15/01/2021, 15:11:35

Support: You still have a little time to conclude an agreement on the terms above. Then the
price will increase.

15/01/2021, 19:48:18

Amy Lynn: We have worked day and night to make this work and we understand you're doing
the same. If the price goes up then there is no way we can pay. All we ask is for a little help so
that we can get the cash in your hands. $450,000 is not a small amount for us.

15/01/2021, 19:51:22

Support: I'm sorry. I'll talk to the boss today, but I'm afraid he'll stand his ground.

15/01/2021, 19:53:04

Amy Lynn: Thank you. That would be helpful

15/01/2021, 20:16:59

Amy Lynn: Did you talk to your boss today?

16/01/2021, 10:28:15

Support: Not yet, will update you as soon as he replies.

16/01/2021, 18:11:58

16/01/2021, 18:25:54

Support: we can upload on mega. yes.

16/01/2021, 18:41:15

Amy Lynn: Ok, we'll be in touch. It may be hard since this is a holiday weekend but we'll send
an update

16/01/2021, 18:45:20

Amy Lynn: We're hoping to pay by tomorrow, since today is a holiday. Ok?

18/01/2021, 15:59:59

Support: Yes. Let me know as soon as the transfer is made.

18/01/2021, 17:06:36

Amy Lynn: Still here? Can you confirm the wallet for $450,000?

19/01/2021, 16:04:16

Support: Yes, just a minute.

19/01/2021, 16:14:23
