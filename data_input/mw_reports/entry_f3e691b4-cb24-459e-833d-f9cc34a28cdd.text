return of fake UPS cannot deliver malspam with an updated nemucod ransomware and
Kovter payload

The UPS failed to deliver messages have come back with a vengeance yesterday. I haven’t seen them in UK for a while now , but it looks like
the Kovter gang have taken advantage of the Petya outbreak to add to the mix. They have updated the nemucod ransomware version to make
it, on first look, impossible to decrypt at this time without paying the ransom
Update 12 July 2017: Decryptor now available Download HERE
Thanks to the wonderful and dedicated techs at Emsisoft. There is now a decryptor for this ransomware. You can find a clear, easy to follow
set of instructions on how to use the decryptor at Bleeping Computer
Important Notice: With this Nemucod Ransomware version your files get encrypted without changing file names or file extensions. The victim
only knows his or her files are definitely gone when they try to open them or see the changed desktop background and ransom message. If an
antivirus kicks in & removes the malware files and the desktop warning which frequently happens, then the victim only knows his or her files
are definitely gone when they try to open them.
I recently came across ( off line) a couple of examples where a victim asked for help with image files they could not open. On careful
examination we saw their anti-malware tool had kicked in, removed ( or blocked the creation of ) the .hta file which displayed the “your Files
are encrypted” message and the original .js file, but had not detected or removed most of the other files that actually do the encryption, so the
victim did not know that their problem was caused by ransomware.
Update 2 July 2017: now also using FedEx and delivering Kovter & Cerber ransomware, while the UPS continues simultaneously delivering
Nemucod ransomware and Kovter
Update 7 July 2017: slight change to the js file in the emails that delivers the ransomware and Kovter payloads (See below)
Update 19 July 2017: I am informed that for the last couple of days these are only distributing the Nemucod php Ransomware not Kovter. (
Kovter is still on the compromised download sites and manually available for download, although an older well detected version). I have seen
this before on odd occasions when the malware bad actors are in process of adding or changing one or more of the malware downloads. I
would not be surprised to see a different ransomware and backdoor payload being distributed in the next few days. Especially now there is a
publicly available decoder / decryptor so income for this gang will stop or vastly reduce with present versions.
Update 23 July 2017: a change in the ransom note see below
Update 30 July 2017: another change in js file see below
Update 16 August 2017: there has been a 2 week break from these, but this morning they are starting to trickle in again. see below
Update 19 August 2017: A change in behaviour today. They have switched back to using Locky ransomware as the payload ( see below) I
haven’t seen Locky ransomware delivered by these fake UPS delivery emails for over 6 months.
Update 20 August 2017: yet another change today. now a html file attachment that pretends to be a word on line word document that cannot
be read in your browser so you need to download & run the plug in to make it work See below

1/11

Thanks to Michael Gillespie a well known anti-ransomware campaigner for his assistance and pointing me in the right direction about the new
nemucod ransomware version. If I hadn’t seen his tweet asking for samples, I would probably just ignored this as a recurrence of the usual
“failed to deliver” spam, scam messages pretending to come from all major delivery companies and added a foot note to one of the other
hundreds of posts on this blog about this persistent malware spreading method.
If you get infected by this or any other ransomware please check out the ID Ransomware service which will help to identify what ransomware
you have been affected by and offer suggestions for decryption
The emails are the same as usual ( you only have to look through this blog and search for UPS or FedEx or USPS and see hundreds of
different examples and subjects)

Another researcher has created a video showing the infection chain with this ransomware. It clearly shows that the files get encrypted without
changing file names or file extensions. The victim only knows his or her files are definitely gone when they try to open them or see the
changed desktop background and ransom message.
And this video also created by the same researcher with the newly updated version of the js file ( 7 July 2017 ). This video shows word being
opened but no doc appearing, just garbled plain txt. while all the action happens in the background while your attention is on the fake word
doc. It clearly shows the encryption happening before the hta file that creates and displays the ransom note is dropped and the desktop
changed and ransom notes created.
We have been hearing about some antiviruses block .hta file creation or delete them as soon as they are created before they can display the
ransom note. But not recognize or block the actual .js file and the subsequent php files from running, so allow the ransomware to work.
Because there is no displayed note or background change the victim doesn’t realise their files have been encrypted until they go to use them.
but there is a difference in the .js files that are coming in the zips.
The initial js looks very similar to previous but has much longer vars ( var zemk) that is used to download the other files. This file looks like

2/11

as usual you take the first site name in var x and add /counter/? and then var zemk to get the counter.js. these download counter.js. ( if the
first site is not responding, it moves on to the other sites in the list). The first smaller counter.js is downloaded when you use internet explorer
to download it or an IE user agent in Wget. The second larger counter.js is only delivered when the js from the email is allowed to download it,
or you use a “null” user agent via browser or wget or use Chrome or Firefox browser.
the small one looks like

The downloaded counter needs to be deobfuscated by using the specific var ruxk in the original js file not the var zemk as in previous versions
giving

3/11

The larger counter (1) which is a transformed to the ( drops the embedded) php file ( only a part shown in screenshot)

which is decoded using the same vars as in earlier example to

4/11

Which in turn needs further decoding to make a working php file that actually does the encryption, which I decoded using the online php
decoding service http://www.unphp.net/decode/519e3ad90af1d2854b014a259e079e98/ giving something more readable to humans
Where I am told the relevant part for our purposes is:

Showing a high level of encryption that at this time appears unable to be decrypted without paying the ransom.
This ransom note ( or something similar with different links gets displayed on the victim’s desktop

The original js downloads 4 files via the counter file1 is Kovter as usual, the second is unknown and there is a massive 6.7mb php
interpreter. The 2nd file won’t run without the php interpreter. It looks like it also belongs to PHP and both php files together are needed to run
the downloaded php counter files to encrypt the computer
You get 3 identical named files, with different file extensions in THIS example from 4 July 2017 we got
162citM2mvkp8bEpsLyUchneaUyauzndYZ.doc which appears to be data and not a word doc that is somehow involved in the ransomware

5/11

162citM2mvkp8bEpsLyUchneaUyauzndYZ.php ( VirusTotal)
162citM2mvkp8bEpsLyUchneaUyauzndYZ.exe which is a genuine php interpreter file ( VirusTotal)
All 3 work together to do the ransomware and need to be called and run from the original js file and needs all files to be downloaded to the
correct places on the victim’s computer otherwise you don’t get ransomed
then we got the Kovter malware payload as well from winnicemoldawii.pl/counter/?2 ( VirusTotal)
For some reason a manual download using Internet Explorer browser or Wget with an IE User Agent of the URL in the emailed .js file will
give a cut down version of the counter file which only gives Kovter & the innocent PHP files not the ransomware, but using a null user agent or
Firefox or Chrome gives the full counter as shown and made available in the PayloadSecurity report which contains the embedded php
ransomware file in encoded/obfuscated form. I suppose that this is intended to fool or create confusion for researchers who tend to use an IE
user agent in Wget, because so much malware wants to use IE as a downloader because that is the default browser on many susceptible
victim’s computers.

None of the online sandboxes were able to show encryption in action although they do show all the downloaded files ( I don’t think any of the
sandboxes are set to act on all retrieved files only .exe files). All the sandboxes did show error messages about missing files and missing
dependencies, that doesn’t happen on the majority of real computers.

The Kovter download looks like it works separately to the ransomware but might actually be involved somewhere along the line.

Update 7 July 2017: new sites include : ( still older sites being used as well ) But there is a slight change to the js file in the email zip. I think it
is basically a change in the order the instructions & vars are laid out rather than any major functional change. They still download counter.js
which contains an embedded php file which performs the ransomware attack along with multiple other associated files and of course Kovter

Update 30 July 2017: Over the last week we have noticed most zips have contained a 0 byte .js file. Then on Saturday 29 July 2017, they
started to reuse several of the very old sites from 1 month ago, most of which are cleaned up and no malware on them. Then today Sunday 30
July 2017 emails coming with several new sites and another slight change in the .js files, where several of the var & function names have
changed and an extra layer of obfuscation applied. Still same onion site for payments. We are also noticing a slight change in some of the
delivery emails. Instead of a generic Dear customer, they are inserting Dear < recipient’s first name> but only where the recipient has a
definitely recognisable human name. emails sent to recipients such as info@, help@, customerservice@, scanner@, Xerox994@ etc all still
get Dear customer.

It looks like the Payload Security reports are showing a false positive ( along with VirusTotal ) on some sites on the same IP numbers as the
malware sites. In particular the Russian Red Cross Site is being flagged as malicious. I cannot see any suspicious content on the links but it
might be worth the Red Cross webmaster investigating, just in case

Update 16 August 2017: there has been a 2 week break from these, but this morning they are starting to trickle in again. The js attachment
and the resulting nemucod ransomware look functionally identical to the previous ones. Several of the sites are the same as the 30 July list

we are seeing a change today and although the original .js inside the zip is downloading a counter file from the compromised sites, this doesn’t
appear to be nemucodaes ransomware today. It is still downloading the PHP interpreter and other php files but also a new file that has poor
VirusTotal detections. It appears to be Locky ransomware with a C2 185.75.46.193

Update 20 August 2017:
Yet another change to the delivery method this afternoon/evening
Emails are still functionally similar but the attachment is now a html file that when opened pretends to be a word on line word document that
cannot be read in your browser so you need to download & run the plug in to make it work. The plugin is a js file that is exactly the same as
yesterday’s files with the same sites hard coded in it
Email looks like:

10/11

The html file when opened looks like this in chrome browser. The link won’t work to download the zip file in Internet explorer because it uses
data:application/zip;base64, which IE will not allow to open from a browser. Chrome & Firefox do open them. This eventually delivers the
same locky ransomware file that has been used for the last couple of days
