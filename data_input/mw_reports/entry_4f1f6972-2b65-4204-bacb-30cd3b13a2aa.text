Yanluowang is a type of targeted ransomware discovered by the Symantec Threat Hunter
team as they were investigating an incident on a large corporate network. Kaspersky experts
have found a vulnerability in the Yanluowang encryption algorithm and created a free
decryptor to help victims of this ransomware with recovering their files.

Yanluowang description
The ransomware is relatively recent, its name a reference to the Chinese deity Yanluo Wang,
one of the Ten Kings of Hell. Unfortunately, we do not know much about the victims.
According to Kaspersky Security Network data, attacks have been carried out in the United
States, Brazil, Turkey and a few other countries. The low number of infections is due to the
targeted nature of the ransomware: threat actors prepare and implement attacks on specific
companies only.

In the ransom note, the cybercriminals demand not to contact law enforcement and not ‘keep
them for fools’:

The ransomware program has the functionality to terminate virtual machines, processes and
services. This is necessary to make files used by other programs available for encryption.
The main parts of stopped services and processes include databases, email services,
browsers, programs for working with documents, security solutions, backups and shadow
copy services.

Lists of stopped services and processes
According to public information about the ransomware, it is only used in targeted attacks
rather than in other RaaS families. Yanluowang itself needs parameters to be executed in the
system, meaning it will be executed either manually or through a combination of scripts in the
compromised system. The available syntax in the ransomware is:
1

encrypt.exe [(-p,-path,--path)<path>]

The Sosemanuk stream cipher is used to encrypt files, its key then encrypted using the RSA1024 asymmetric algorithm. The RSA public key itself is embedded in the program but
additionally encrypted with the RC4 stream cipher whose key is a string and also embedded
in ransomware. Files before and after encryption:

Yanluowang divides files into big and small along a 3 GB threshold. Small files are encrypted
completely from beginning to end, big files are encrypted in stripes: 5 megabytes after every
200 megabytes.

The encryption code for big files
After a file is encrypted, an RSA-encrypted Sosemanuk key is written to the end of it. The
encrypted endfile block has a size of 1024 bytes.

Files decryption
Kaspersky experts have analyzed the ransomware and found a vulnerability that allows
decrypting files of affected users via a known-plaintext attack. All that was required for this to
work was added to the Rannoh decryption tool.
To decrypt a file, you should have at least one original file. As mentioned earlier, the
Yanluowang ransomware divides files into big and small files along a 3 gigabyte threshold.
This creates a number of conditions that must be met in order to decrypt certain files:
To decrypt small files (less than or equal to 3 GB), you need a pair of files with a size of
1024 bytes or more. This is enough to decrypt all other small files.
To decrypt big files (more than 3 GB), you need a pair of files (encrypted and original)
no less than 3 GB in size each. This will be enough to decrypt both big and small files.
By virtue of the above points, if the original file is larger than 3 GB, it is possible to decrypt all
files on the infected system, both big and small. But if there is an original file smaller than 3
GB, then only small files can be decrypted.

Indicators of Compromise
Kaspersky solutions detect and protect against this ransomware, detecting it as TrojanRansom.Win32.Yanluowang with File Threat Protection and proactively as
PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic with Behavior Detection.

Piece of advice
Still, it is important for a company to have a security solution that would enable instant
response to such ransomware threats in order to avoid large financial losses. Yanluowang
was deployed in targeted human-operated attacks. As usual in such cases, we would like to
remind you that a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is required to protect against this
type of threats.
Here are Kaspersky’s recommendations for staying safe from ransomware attacks:
Do not expose remote desktop services (such as RDP) to public networks unless
absolutely necessary, and always use strong passwords.
Promptly install available patches for commercial VPN solutions that provide access for
remote employees and act as gateways to your network.
Always keep software up to date on all your devices to prevent ransomware from
exploiting vulnerabilities.

Focus your defense strategy on detecting lateral movement and data exfiltration to the
Internet. Pay special attention to outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals’ connections.
Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access your backups in an
emergency.
To protect the corporate environment, educate your employees. Dedicated training
courses can help, such as the ones provided on Kaspersky Automated Security
Awareness Platform.
Use the latest Threat Intelligence information to stay on top of actual TTPs used by
threat actors.
Use solutions like Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response and Kaspersky
Managed Detection and Response service which help to identify and stop an attack in
the early stages, before attackers can achieve their objectives.
Use a reliable endpoint security solution, such as Kaspersky Endpoint Security for
Business, that is powered by exploit prevention, behavior detection and a remediation
engine capable of rolling back malicious actions. KESB also has self-defense
mechanisms that can prevent its removal by cybercriminals.
