SMART MEDICINE BREACHES ITS “FIRST DO NO HAR…

#TheSAS2017 presentation: Smart Medicine Breaches Its “First Do No
Harm” Principle
At last year’s Security Analyst Summit 2017 we predicted that medical
networks would be a titbit for cybercriminals. Unfortunately, we were
right. The numbers of medical data breaches and leaks are increasing.
According to public data, this year is no exception.
For a year we have been observing how cybercriminals encrypt medical
data and demand a ransom for it. How they penetrate medical networks
and exﬁltrate medical information, and how they ﬁnd medical data on
publicly available medical resources.

Journal)

Opened doors in medical
networks
To ﬁnd a potential entry point into medical infrastructure, we extract the
IP ranges of all organizations that have the keywords “medic”, “clinic”,
“hospit”, “surgery” and “healthcare” in the organization’s name, then we
start the masscan (port scanner) and parse the specialized search engines
(like Shodan and Censys) for publicly available resources of these
organizations.

Masscan report extract
Of course, medical perimeters contain a lot of trivial opened ports and
services: like web-server, DNS-server, mail-server etc. And you know
that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The most interesting part is the nontrivial ports. We left out trivial services, because as we mentioned in our
previous article those services are out of date and need to be patched. For
example, the web applications of electronic medical records that we
found on the perimeters in most cases were out of date.
The most popular ports are the tip of the iceberg. The most interesting
part is the non-trivial ports.

The most popular opened ports on medical perimeters (18,723 live hosts;
27,716 opened ports)
Using ZTag tool and Censys, we identify what kinds of services are hidden
behind these ports. If you try to look deeper in the embedded tag you will
see diﬀerent stuﬀ: for example printers, SCADA-type systems, NAS etc.

Top services on medical network perimeters
Excluding these trivial things, we found Building Management systems
that out of date. Devices using the Niagara Fox protocol usually operate
on TCP ports 1911 and 4911. They allow us to gather information remotely
from them, such as application name, Java version, host OS, time zone,
local IP address, and software versions involved in the stack.

Example of extracted information about Niagara Fox service
Or printers that have a web interface without an authentication request.
The dashboard available online and allows you to get information about
internal Wi-Fi networks or, probably, it allows you to get info about
documents that appeared in “Job Storage” logs.

Shodan told us that some medical organizations have an opened port
2000. It’s a smart kettle. We don’t know why, but this model of kettle is
very popular in medical organizations. And they have publicly available
information about a vulnerability that allows a connection to the kettle to
be established using a simple pass and to extract info about the current
Wi-Fi connection.

Medical infrastructure has a lot of medical devices, some of them
portable. And devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors
support the MQTT protocol to communicate with other devices directly.
One of the main components of the MQTT communication – brokers (see
here for detailed information about components) are available through
the Internet and, as a result, we can ﬁnd some medical devices online.

Not only Smart Home components, but also medical devices are available
via MQTT Spirometer

Threats that aﬀect medical
networks
OK, now we know how they get in. But what’s next? Do they search for
personal data, or want to get some money with a ransom or maybe
something else? Money? It’s possible… anything is possible. Let’s take a
look at some numbers that we collected during 2017.
The statistics are a bit worrying. More than 60% of medical organizations
had some kind of malware on their servers or computers. The good news
is that if we count something here, it means we’ve deleted malware in the
system.

Attacks detected in medical organizations, 2017
And there’s something even more interesting – organizations closely
connected to hospitals, clinics and doctors, i.e. the pharmaceutical
industry. Here we see even more attacks. The pharmaceutical industry
means “money”, so it’s another titbit for attackers.

Attacks detected in pharmaceutical organizations, 2017
Let’s return to our patients. Where are all these attacked hospitals and
clinics? Ok, here we the numbers are relative: we divided the number of
devices in medical organizations in the country with our AV by the
number of devices where we detected malicious code. The TOP 3 were
the Philippines, Venezuela and Thailand. Japan, Saudi Arabia and Mexico
took the last three spots in the TOP 15.
So the chances of being attacked really depend on how much money the
government spends on cybersecurity in the public sector and the level of
cybersecurity awareness.

Attacked devices in medical organizations, TOP 15 countries
In the pharmaceutical industry we have a completely diﬀerent picture.
First place belongs to Bangladesh. I googled this topic and now the stats

look absolutely ok to me. Bangladesh exports meds to Europe. In
Morocco big pharma accounts for 14% of GDP. India, too, is in the list, and
even some European countries are featured.

Attacked devices in pharmaceutical organizations, TOP 15 countries
On one in ten devices and in more than 25% of medical and 10% of
pharmaceutical companies we detected hacktools: pentesting tools like
Mimikatz, Meterpreter, tweaked remote administration kits, and so on.
Which means that either medical organizations are very mature in terms
of cybersecurity and perform constant audits of their own infrastructure
using red teams and professional pentesters, or, more likely, their
networks are infested with hackers.
Hacktools: Powerpreter, Meterpreter, Remote admin, etc.

APT
Our research showed that APT actors are interested in information from
pharmaceutical organizations. We were able to identify victims in South
East Asia, or more precisely, in Vietnam and Bangladesh. The criminals
had targeted servers and used the infamous PlugX malware or Cobalt
Strike to exﬁltrate data.
PlugX RAT, used by Chinese-speaking APT actors, allows criminals to
perform various malicious operations on a system without the user’s
knowledge or authorization, including but not limited to copying and
modifying ﬁles, logging keystrokes, stealing passwords and capturing
screenshots of user activity. PlugX, as well as Cobalt Strike, is used by
cybercriminals to discreetly steal and collect sensitive or proﬁtable
information. During our research we were unable to track the initial attack

vectors, but there are signs that they could be attacks exploiting
vulnerable software on servers.
Taking into account the fact that hackers placed their implants on the
servers of pharmaceutical companies, we can assume they are after
intellectual property or business plans.

How to live with it
Remove all nodes that process medical data from public
Periodically update your installed software and remove unwanted
applications
Refrain from connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN of
your organization
