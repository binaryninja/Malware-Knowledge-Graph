"Operation Newscaster", as labelled by American firm iSIGHT Partners in 2014, is a cyber
espionage covert operation directed at military and political figures using social networking,
allegedly done by Iran. The operation has been described as "creative",[1] "long-term" and
"unprecedented".[2] According to iSIGHT Partners, it is "the most elaborate cyber espionage
campaign using social engineering that has been uncovered to date from any nation".[2]

On 29 May 2014, Texas-based cyber espionage research firm iSIGHT Partners released a
report, uncovering an operation it labels "Newscaster" since at-least 2011, has targeted at
least
[2][3] 2,000 people in United States, Israel, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The victims who are not identified in the document due to security reasons, are senior U.S.
military and diplomatic personnel, congresspeople, journalists, lobbyists, think tankers and
defense contractors, including a four-star admiral.[2][3]
The firm couldn’t determine what data the hackers may have stolen.[3]
According to the iSIGHT Partners report, hackers used 14 "elaborated fake" personas
claiming to work in journalism, government, and defense contracting and were active in
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube and Blogger. To establish trust and
credibility, the users fabricated a fictitious journalism website, NewsOnAir.org, using content
from the media like Associated Press, BBC, Reuters and populated their profiles with
fictitious personal content. They then tried to befriend target victims and sent them "friendly
messages"[1] with Spear-phishing to steal email passwords[4] and attacks and infecting them
to a "not particularly sophisticated" malware for data exfiltration.[2][3]
The report says NewsOnAir.org was registered in Tehran and likely hosted by an Iranian
provider. The Persian word "Parastoo" (‫ ;ﭘﺮﺳﺘﻮ‬meaning swallow) was used as a password for
malware associated with the group, which appeared to work during business hours in
Tehran[2] as they took Thursday and Friday off.[1] iSIGHT Partners could not confirm whether
the hackers had ties to the Iranian government.[4]

Analysis
According to Al Jazeera, Chinese army's cyber unit carried out scores of similar phishing
schemes.[4]
Morgan Marquis-Boire, a researcher at the University of Toronto stated that the campaign
"appeared to be the work of the same actors performing malware attacks on Iranian
dissidents and journalists for at least two years".[4]
Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the EastWest Institute and a founding member of the
Worldwide Cybersecurity Initiative, stated that “They’re not doing this for a quick buck, to
extrapolate data and extort an organization. They’re in it for the long haul. Sophisticated
human engineering has been the preferred method of state actors”.[4]
