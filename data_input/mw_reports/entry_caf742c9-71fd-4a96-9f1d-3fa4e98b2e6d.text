Introduction
In the past couple years, Palo Alto Networks reported on the “Prince of Persia” malware
campaign which is believed to be of Iranian origin and ongoing for more than 10 years. The
original research, published in 2016, called the malware Infy and their second report,
published in 2017, named the upgraded malware Foudre. The name “Foudre” comes from a
string in the binary used to check if the computer is already infected. At the time of their
blog post, Palo Alto Networks stated the version of Foudre they observed were versions 1
and 2. We have found new evidence of the Prince of Persia campaign active by finding a
new version of the Foudre malware, version 8.

In this blog post, we are only going to focus on the new, unique, interesting features of the
new version of Foudre, and its related campaign

(Internal version name of Foudre v8)
No to The Forced Hijab
Similarly to the samples noted in previous reports, this new malware also comes packaged
in a WinRAR SFX archive including multiple malicious binaries and a media file. The media
file in this case is a video in the MP4 format showing a woman in Iran walking around and at
the end pulling off her hijab. In the video, there is text written in Farsi with a hashtag, ‫ﺑﻨﻪ ﺑﻪ‬
‫ﺣﺠﺎب اﺟﺒﺎری‬#, literally translating to “no to the forced hijab.” This hashtag is in reference to
protesters in Iran who are protesting the mandatory use of the hijab for women and the
video is meant to distract the victim while the Foudre malware gets installed in the
background.

(Screenshot from the video bundled in the malware)
Foudre is a remote access tool and has the ability to remotely execute commands, steal
information about the infected target (such as keystrokes, process information, etc), and
auto-update itself. Most of the code and functionality from the previous versions of Foudre
and Infy was reused and can be read about in the reports linked above, so we are only
going to focus on the new, unique, interesting features and the linkage of code reuse from
previous versions.
Code Reuse
After uploading the WinRAR SFX to Intezer Analyze™, the files inside were statically
extracted which reveals 3 binaries, a lockbox3 signature, and the video mentioned above.

Using our new Show Code feature, we can see code overlapping with Foudre and Infy.

New Features/Changes
First of all, the main binary of the upgraded Foudre malware is mostly undetected on
VirusTotal with only 3/67 detections.

(VirusTotal)
In the latest version of Foudre, there are 2 modules. One of the modules (i7234.dll) has the
export “D1” and the other module (d388) exports “D2” as a function. We are going to refer to
the different binaries based on their exports, D1 and D2. The third binary never gets
launched and is still under investigation. We will release more details about it on a further
date. The WinRAR SFX and D1 module only get executed once. The following
features/changes are spread across the WinRAR SFX, D1, and D2:
WinRAR SFX Dropper
1. WinRAR SFX has icon of girl with hijab from video
2. Extracts files
3. Launches D1 ( i7234.dll) with rundll32 and executes export D1
D1
1. D1 executes the mp4 file
2. Checks if finds a window “TNRRDPKE2” means it’s already running
3. Copies D2 and key to %APPDATA% with filenames a.n and p.k and creates a shortcut
in the folder named “an.lnk” C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe a.n D2 838238125

4. Deletes these files from TEMP folder
5. Stores name of D2 (a.n) in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\temp in key called
“ran2”
6. Checks HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
for SnailDriver
7. Creates autorun for an.lnk
8. Checks for %PROGRAMFILES%\Kaspersky Lab
9. Launches D2 with rundll32 “C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe a.n D2 838238125”
D2 has mostly the same features as reported in the older versions of Foudre but this table

Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)
The DGA used by version 8 of Foudre has only changed slightly from the previous versions.
In the previous versions, the DGA algorithm was calculated by the following algorithm
(credit to Esmid Idrizovic):
ToHex(CRC32(“NRV1” + year + month + week_number)) + (“.space”|”.net”|”.top”)
There are two minor differences now when calculating the C2. NRV1 was replaced with
NRTV1 and .dynu.net was added as suffix to the domain making the algorithm now:
ToHex(CRC32(“NRTV1” + year + month + week_number)) +
(“.space”|”.net”|”.top”|”.dynu.net”)

6/8

A few of the calculated domains were added to the bottom of the report in the IoCs section.
The domains up to week of September 9, 2018 (week 35) have been registered in Panama
and resolve to the same IP address 185[.]61[.]154[.]26. The oldest domain using this
algorithm we could find that was registered was registered for the week of November 5,
2017.

Conclusion
Due to the content of the video and the information from the reports on previous versions of
Foudre, we believe the targets are mostly Iranian citizens. We have registered some of the
future generated domains to prevent the attack, and will update the post with information in
regards to the infected victims.
