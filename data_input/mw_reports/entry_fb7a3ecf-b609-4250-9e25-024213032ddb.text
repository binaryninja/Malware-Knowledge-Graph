Vulnerabilities in the kernel mode component have serious implications on endpoint security.
Operating systems and independent software vendors have been improving the security of
code for years, but what happens if an endpoint is still using a kernel mode driver designed
and implemented 10 years ago?
CrowdStrike reached out to Dell reporting a driver vulnerability (CVE-2021-21551)
affecting the dbutil_2_3.sys kernel mode driver found in Dell’s system update software
used to update the BIOS. After establishing communication and receiving confirmation on
the vulnerability, Dell publicly disclosed the issue on May 4, 2021, in a coordinated effort with
other security researchers who reported the same issue to minimize disruptions for
potentially impacted endpoints.
What makes this vulnerability stand out in dbutil_2_3.sys is that drivers are legitimately
signed and can remain unpatched “in the wild” for years, significantly increasing the attack
surface for adversaries.

1/5

With a CVSS base score of 8.8, its potential weaponization could impact Dell enterprise
systems around the world for years. While Dell has released a security bulletin
acknowledging the 10-year driver issue, CrowdStrike Falcon® customers are protected
against an attempt to exploit it.

User Land Is Good, Kernel Mode Is King
Adversaries are constantly updating their tactics and techniques to maximize their efficiency
in compromising targets while flying below the defenders’ radar. The DSA-2021-088 (CVE2021-21551) vulnerability could potentially be one such tool that once added to the
adversary’s toolset would allow for kernel-mode privilege escalation.
Vulnerabilities in kernel drivers can be the holy grail of adversarial tactics as they enable
privilege escalation to the point where adversaries can make system changes ranging from
deactivating security measures to stealing user credentials and pivoting laterally across the
infrastructure.

The Dell Driver Vulnerability
DSA-2021-088 pertains to the vulnerability in Dell’s dbutil_2_3.sys kernel mode driver. This
driver is used by Dell’s system update software to update BIOS, for example, and is
embedded into, extracted from and loaded by the BIOS update executables, such as
LatitudeXXXX.exe.
The issue with this driver is that it exposes multiple IOCTLs that let non-administrators
perform operations that would typically require administrator privileges. As such, it allows
local privilege escalation (LPE).
Some examples include but are not limited to:
0x9B0C1EC8 and 0x9B0C1EC4 allow arbitrary kernel memory write and read
0x9B0C1F44 and 0x9B0C1F40 allow arbitrary physical memory write and read
0x9B0C1F80, 0x9B0C1F84, 0x9B0C1F88, 0x9B0C1F8C and a few others allow
access to arbitrary IO ports
All of these are LPEs for non-administrators. While there is no publicly available exploit of
which we are aware as of this writing, some of these vulnerabilities are exploitable in
practice. Below is an example exploitation of 0x9B0C1EC4 reading contents of kernel
memory address from a non-administrator user.

Adding to the complexity of the issue, this driver can be automatically loaded if the endpoint
has already installed Dell’s system update programs and has been configured to check
updates automatically. This means that an attacker would not need to drop the
dbutil_2_3.sys file, elevate itself to the administrator and load the driver. All it would take is to
execute a program that issues IOCTL as non-administrator, which is substantially harder to
detect compared with the former scenario.

CrowdStrike’s Protection
The CrowdStrike Falcon platform provides visibility into these issues and has protected
endpoints from exploitation of vulnerable drivers through Additional User-Mode Data
(AUMD). For more information on this, read Detecting and Preventing Kernel Attacks, which
provides details on CrowdStrike coverage and additional examples.
Specifically for DSA-2021-088 (CVE-2021-21551), we provide — for endpoints with Falcon
6.18 and above — visibility against some of the above IOCTLs that are most likely to be
abused in the real world. If one of those IOCTLs is exploited, it would show up in the Falcon
Host UI as a high-severity detection as shown below, even if an attacker avoided the driver
installation steps outlined above.

In addition to the protections against IOCTLs, Falcon provides users with access to Event
Search, which can identify with this query how widely the vulnerable driver is loaded within
the organization.
event_simpleName=DriverLoad SHA256HashData IN
(0296e2ce999e67c76352613a718e11516fe1b0efc3ffdb8918fc999dd76a73a5,
87e38e7aeaaaa96efe1a74f59fca8371de93544b7af22862eb0e574cec49c7c3) | dedup aid

Falcon users can also query processes that initiated the loading of the driver and/or issued
some of the vulnerable IOCTLs that might warrant deeper investigation, through
DriverLoaded and UmppcDetectInfo events as follows:
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
[ search event_simpleName=DriverLoad SHA256HashData IN
(0296e2ce999e67c76352613a718e11516fe1b0efc3ffdb8918fc999dd76a73a5,
87e38e7aeaaaa96efe1a74f59fca8371de93544b7af22862eb0e574cec49c7c3)
| where isnotnull(RpcClientProcessId_decimal)
| rename RpcClientProcessId_decimal as TargetProcessId
| fields TargetProcessId, aid
]
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
[ search event_simpleName=UmppcDetectInfo DeviceName="\\Device\\DBUtil_2_3"
| rename ContextProcessId as TargetProcessId
| fields TargetProcessId, aid
]

CrowdStrike will monitor the active exploitation of the driver and enhance detection as we
observe more cases in the wild. In the meantime, we strongly recommend making an
inventory of the hosts that load the driver and remediate the issue according to the guide
provided by Dell.
We would like to thank Dell for addressing the issue, as well as all community members who
helped Dell to make the fix happen.
