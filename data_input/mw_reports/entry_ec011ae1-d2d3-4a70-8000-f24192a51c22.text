Remote access trojan exploits Telegram communications to steal
data from victims and update itself to perform additional malicious
activities
Research by: Omer Hofman
Telegram, the cloud-based IM platform has enjoyed a surge in popularity this year because
of controversial changes to its rival, WhatsApp’s privacy settings. Telegram was the most
downloaded app worldwide for January 2021 with more than 63 million installs, and has
surpassed 500 million monthly active users. This popularity also extends to the cybercriminal community. Malware authors are increasingly using Telegram as a ready-made
command and control (C&C) system for their malicious products, because it offers several
advantages compared to conventional web-based malware administration.
In this blog, we’ll explore why criminals are increasingly using Telegram for malware control,
using the example of a new malware variant called ‘ToxicEye’ that we have recently
observed in the wild.
Why hackers are turning to Telegram for malware control
The first use of Telegram as the C&C infrastructure for malware was the ‘Masad’ infostealer back in 2017. The criminals behind Masad realized that using a popular IM service
as an integral part of their attacks gave them a number of operational benefits:

1/8

Telegram is a legitimate, easy-to-use and stable service that isn’t blocked by
enterprise anti-virus engines, nor by network management tools
Attackers can remain anonymous as the registration process requires only a mobile
number
The unique communications features of Telegram mean attackers can easily exfiltrate
data from victims’ PCs, or transfer new malicious files to infected machines
Telegram also enables attackers to use their mobile devices to access infected
computers from almost any location globally.
Since Masad became available on hacking forums, dozens of new types of malware that
use Telegram for C&C and exploit Telegram’s features for malicious activity, have been
found as ‘off-the-shelf’ weapons in hacking tool repositories in GitHub.
ToxicEye, a new remote access trojan
Over the past three months, Check Point Research (CPR) has seen over 130 attacks using
a new multi-functional remote access trojan (RAT) dubbed ‘ToxicEye.’ ToxicEye is spread
via phishing emails containing a malicious .exe file. If the user opens the attachment,
ToxicEye installs itself on the victim’s PC and performs a range of exploits without the
victim’s knowledge, including:
stealing data
deleting or transferring files
killing processes on the PC
hijacking the PC’s microphone and camera to record audio and video
encrypting files for ransom purposes
ToxicEye is managed by attackers over Telegram, communicating with the attacker’s C&C
server and exfiltrating data to it.
ToxicEye’s infection chain
The attacker first creates a Telegram account and a Telegram ‘bot.’ A Telegram bot account
is a special remote account with which users can interact by Telegram chat or by adding
them to Telegram groups, or by sending requests directly from the input field by typing the
bot’s Telegram username and a query.
The bot is embedded into the ToxicEye RAT configuration file and compiled into an
executable file (an example of a file name we found was ‘paypal checker by saint.exe’).
Any victim infected with this malicious payload can be attacked via the Telegram bot, which
connects the user’s device back to the attacker’s C&C via Telegram.
In addition, this telegram rat can be downloaded and run by opening a malicious document
seen in the phishing emails called solution.doc and by pressing on “enable content.”

Telegram RAT functionality
Obviously, every RAT using this method has its own functionality, but we were able to
identify a number of key capabilities that characterize most of the recent attacks we
observed:
Data stealing features – the RAT can locate and steal passwords, computer
information, browser history and cookies.
File system control – Deleting and transferring files, or killing PC processes and taking
over the PC’s task manager.
I/O hijacking – the RAT can deploy a keylogger, or record audio and video of the
victim’s surroundings via the PC’s microphone and camera, or hijack the contents of
the clipboard.
Ransomware features – the ability to encrypt and decrypt victim’s files.

How to spot if you’ve been infected and tips to remain protected
1. Search for a file called C:\Users\ToxicEye\rat.exe – if this file exists on your PC,
you have been infected and must immediately contact your helpdesk and erase this
file from your system.
2. Monitor the traffic generated from PCs in your organization to a Telegram C&C –
if such traffic is detected, and Telegram is not installed as an enterprise solution, this
is a possible indicator of compromise
3. Beware of attachments containing usernames – malicious emails often use your
username in their subject line or in the file name of the attachment on it. These
indicate suspicious emails: delete such emails, and never open the attachment nor
reply to the sender.
4. Undisclosed or unlisted recipient(s) – if the email recipient(s) has no names, or the
names are unlisted or undisclosed – this is a good indication this email is malicious
and / or a phishing email.

5. Always note the language in the email – Social engineering techniques are
designed to take advantage of human nature. This includes the fact that people are
more likely to make mistakes when they’re in a hurry and are inclined to follow the
orders of people in positions of authority. Phishing attacks commonly use these
techniques to convince their targets to ignore their potential suspicions about an email
and click on a link or open an attachment.
6. Deploy an automated anti-phishing solution – Minimizing the risk of phishing
attacks to the organization requires AI-based anti-phishing software capable of
identifying and blocking phishing content across all of the organization’s
communication services (email, productivity applications, etc.) and platforms
(employee workstations, mobile devices, etc.). This comprehensive coverage is
necessary since phishing content can come over any medium, and employees may
be more vulnerable to attacks when using mobile devices. Check Point email security
solution will help you prevent the most sophisticated phishing and social engineering
attacks, before they reach users.
Conclusion
The developers who publish these tools disguise their true purpose by defining them as
“Remote Administration Tool” or “for educational purpose only”, although some of their
characteristics are often found in malicious Trojans.
Given that Telegram can be used to distribute malicious files, or as a C&C channel for
remotely controlled malware, we fully expect that additional tools that exploit this platform
will continue to be developed in the future.
