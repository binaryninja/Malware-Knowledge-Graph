TFW Ransomware is only your side hustle...

Wed 31 July 2019 in Ransomware
and you constantly have to apply for jobs. A partial analysis of the "GermanWiper"
Ransomware
Today someone posted about a Ransomware attack on the local chat plaform Jodel (don't
judge please, as you know the sketchy corners of the web get you the best samples :D)
which instantly peaked my interest. What I got was this email and the two attached files.

The two attached files Applicant Name - Lebenslauf Aktuell.doc.lnk and Applicant Name Arbeitszeugnisse Aktuell.doc.lnk are made to look like Microsoft Office Documents but are
actually just Windows File Shortcuts and can easily be parsed with the LNK Parser @
Google Code. The output looks like this:

1/9

The person who provided me with this data was kind enough to also include the ransom
note, which is, unlike most ransomware strains out there in the wild wild cyber west, not a txt
File but rather a HTML file. It includes links to bitcoin exchanges, a hardcoded wallet address
and asks for 0.15038835 BTC as a ransom. Just like the E-Mail it is written in spotless
german but without Umlauts (ä,ö,ü). A cleaned sample can be found here Communication
with the attacker's server at 173.33.106.120 (hosted at OVH) is done via a php script at the
bottom of the ransom note. Since the server was not reachable at the time of analysis I could
not take a closer look at neither the script nor the dropped .hta file that is run via the
powershell command in the .lnks.

The most worrying thing about this sample is the "encryption" though. Every file touched by
GermanWiper is overwritten with zeros. A list of file extensions used by the wiper can be
found on pastebin. Because of this behaviour the malware was dubbed "GermanWiper" by
Michael Gillespie (@Demonslay335). The BleepingComputer Forum post discussing this
strain can be found here.

A not-so-Happy Ending: Encrypted files will not be recoverable and if you are a victim please
spend your money somewhere else and not on the ransom.

Update: A look at the dropped executable

3/9

As a first step I like to run my samples through "Detect it easy" to get a first look at what to
expect. Not a huge discovery, but it interesting none the less that the executable was likely
compiled with Visual Studio 2010.

4/9

Let's check the entropy of the sample to see if it is packed. Heavy obfuscation is a rare sight
for ransomware, but running your executable through a packer or crypter of some sort might
avoid detection through already existing signatures and ransom campaigns often ship more
than one version of their executable.

5/9

A quick test to see how much effort the attackers have put into it is to try to unpack it with
upx, but no such luck in this case:

I'm not quite sure why, but the attackers set an Amazon Logo as a file icon for the malware.
Maybe to lure the victim into clicking on it ?
With
this sample we also get to see a new domain for a control server at
expandingdelegation[.]top (8.208.13.24) in the ransom note, so this sample might already be
part of a second wave since it was still dropping the executable today (02.08.2019).

6/9

A couple of noteworthy events after running the sample in a virtual machine: The
Ransomware runs vssadmin.exe to delete system restore points and shadow copies.
Furthermore this command will disable recovery options at system startup, but not without
first asking the victim for their approval first (how nice of them).

The seemingly arbitrary

process description of the GermanWiper process might be a handy string to keep in mind for
identification of samples in the future.

To display the ransomnote after system startup it creates two entries in the start menue..

..and an entry to open the html

Ransom-File in the msconfig autostart.

Thanks again to @Demonslay335, @James_inthe_box and all the other researchers who
contributed to the anlysis of this threat. This article has also been mentioned in this excellent
ZDNet Article, which is quite an honor, thanks :D
