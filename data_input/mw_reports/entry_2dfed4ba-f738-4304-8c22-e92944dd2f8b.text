In May, we reported a spike in cyber security incidents which had caused a significant impact
on organisations already dealing with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many of these incidents were the result of ransomware attacks and some of them had been
accompanied by data breaches.
Since then, analysis by our Threat Intelligence team has shown that the pace and frequency
of ransomware attacks have risen. In this update, we take a closer look at the trends driving
the growth in these incidents.

The number of ransomware actors is increasing...
There has been a sharp increase in the number of ransomware operations this year,
following a trend already established in 2019. This is likely the result of the high profile of
ransomware incidents and, in cases where details of ransom payments have entered the
1/5

public domain, the perceived profitability of human-operated ransomware attacks. This is
attracting new players into the market. Recent arrivals include the ransomware systems
Avaddon, Darkside, Smaug and SunCrypt.
The growth in ransomware operations is not confined to new actors. Many established
criminal groups have already added ransomware to their portfolios. Banking trojans such as
Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot are now more commonly used as the initial delivery mechanism
in highly targeted ransomware attacks. The latest threat actor to make this switch is QakBot,
which since March 2020 has been used in the delivery of ProLock and DoppelPaymer
ransomware.
The shift by established criminal actors towards ransomware is likely driven by opportunity
costs. Successful online banking attacks rely on complex money laundering operations to
receive stolen funds and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts under criminal control. The
specialist criminals who provide money laundering services demand high commissions,
whereas ransom payments are usually direct to cryptocurrency wallets already controlled by
the attackers. As a consequence, ransomware operations are almost certainly more
profitable than online banking attacks.

...because the barriers to entry are dropping
Ransomware operations can be grouped into three broad categories: private schemes,
affiliate programmes and builders.
Private schemes
Affiliate programmes
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)

Private schemes
We assess that several of the most significant ransomware threats, including Ryuk/Conti and
WastedLocker, are run privately. They are operated by criminal enterprises whose leadership
has been active for over a decade and which comprise many of the most sophisticated and
experienced criminal actors we currently track.
These actors are largely secretive and do not participate in the criminal forums or
marketplaces frequented by less-established actors; instead, they either have all of the
resources they need in-house, or where they do need to bring in external expertise, they
employ private communication channels to do so.

Affiliate programmes
Ransomware operators such as Sodinokibi, NetWalker and Nefilim are run as affiliate
programmes. The threat actors are responsible for the development and management of the
malware. They provide access to the ransomware to their affiliates whose role is to conduct
2/5

attacks.
The funds extorted from victims are divided between the ransomware operators and their
affiliates in pre-agreed, profit-sharing arrangements. This enables actors with network
intrusion and exploitation skills to acquire access to ransomware capabilities they could not
easily develop themselves, reducing the barriers to entry.

Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
In RaaS schemes, the developer sells access to the malware for a one-off fee. The products
are usually marketed as “builders”, in that the purchaser can configure the ransomware
through a graphic user interface (GUI) which then compiles the malware into a working
binary. In addition to a one-off fee, some RaaS schemes offer a subscription service which
provides users with “rebuilds” to reduce antivirus detections and/or updates when new
features become available.

RaaS schemes are sold on criminal marketplaces and many are marketed as a better
alternative to affiliate programmes: after the initial purchase is made, the actor keeps 100%
of any revenue generated from their attacks. RaaS schemes have all but removed the entry
bar to ransomware operations as all that is required to obtain a working malware package is
the funds to make the purchase and access to the criminal marketplaces where they are
sold.
In general, RaaS actors tend to target SMEs, whereas affiliate programmes and private
ransomware operations are more likely to attack larger organisations. This is because RaaS
customers often do not possess the requisite skills needed to attack and exploit large,
complex networks.

Ransomware operations are scalable
The arrival of new ransomware groups, the proliferation of RaaS schemes and the fact that
established criminal actors have added ransomware operations to their activities have all led
to an increase in attacks. But another key factor is that many ransomware operations are
inherently scalable. High-profile affiliate programmes like Sodinokibi and NetWalker have
actively recruited new partners.
The income of affiliate programmes and the amount of attacks they are able to sustain are a
function of the number and effectiveness of the affiliates that threat actors have recruited.
This has introduced a degree of competition between rival affiliate programmes, as they try
3/5

to attract high-quality candidates to expand their operations. For example, the threat actor
controlling Sodinokibi expects to retain 30-40% of the revenue generated by its affiliates,
whereas a selling point of the NetWalker scheme is that successful partners can retain 8090% of the proceeds of their attacks.

Established players are raising their game
Two of the most established and prominent ransomware threat actors have upgraded their
systems in 2020. BitPaymer, a ransomware variant operated by the threat actor with the selfstyled name “Evil Corp” (a.k.a. the Dridex Group), was first introduced in 2017. Although the
threat actor added some incremental improvements to the code, the core system has
remained largely unchanged since its introduction. In 2020, “Evil Corp” launched a new
ransomware project known as WastedLocker, which was responsible for high profile attacks
from the outset. Unlike BitPaymer, which was partially derived from the source code for the
Dridex banking trojan, WastedLocker has been written from scratch.
Ryuk, one of the most serious ransomware threats to organisations, was first introduced in
2018. Ryuk operations were at a high tempo throughout 2019 which continued into Q1 of
2020. Since then, a new ransomware variant known as Conti has emerged. Like
WastedLocker, Conti has been written from scratch, but based on coding similarities and the
naming conventions used in files and commands, we assess it has been written by the threat
actor in control of Ryuk.
We don't know why these high-level threat actors have introduced completely new systems,
but it is likely that the rapid growth in ransomware threats has resulted in some potential
targets having a better awareness of, and preparedness for, attacks. The threat actors have
therefore modernised their toolsets in an attempt to retain the initiative.

Data leaks have grown exponentially
As we noted in May, the actors in control of Maze ransomware began a trend by creating a
site where they posted data stolen from victims prior to the encryption of their files. The
purpose of the leak site was to increase the level of coercion on new victims by making an
example of those who refused to pay Maze’s ransom demands.
Since then, the number of actors with currently active leak sites has risen to 15 (or 18 if
discontinued leak sites are also counted), including those in control of private ransomware
systems such as DoppelPaymer, Conti and CL0P. The rate and frequency of leaks has
grown rapidly, with 80% of data leaks occurring since the beginning of May.
There are risks associated with attempting to assess the level of threat posed by different
ransomware actors purely on the level of activity on their leak sites:

4/5

Leak sites normally only display data on victims who have refused to accede to the
attacker’s ransom demands, so it is impossible to gauge how successful individual
actors are in coercing payments from victims;
Some key ransomware actors, for example WastedLocker, do not use leak sites at all,
preferring to operate beneath the radar. Others, such as ProLock are known to
exfiltrate data but do not operate a leak site. However, some of these actors are likely
to sell stolen information that can be used for identity theft or card fraud on specialist
criminal marketplaces; and
Attackers do not always succeed in exfiltrating data from their victims but have still
encrypted their victim’s files.
Nevertheless, the quantity and rate at which data is posted to leak sites may provide some
insight into the scale and tempo of different ransomware operations. It is notable that Maze
accounts for almost 40% of all data leaks and that they have posted data continuously since
February this year. The actors in control of Conti began leaking data no earlier than the end
of July, but in a little over six weeks have accounted for 13% of all leaks by ransomware
actors.

Conclusion
Ransomware attacks affect practically every business sector and are growing in intensity.
This is fuelled by an influx of new ransomware actors, the expansion of existing affiliate
schemes and the pursuit of improved revenues by established cyber crime actors. The
barriers to entry into ransomware operations have been lowered by RaaS schemes which
means that SMEs are as much at risk from a ransomware attack as large organisations,
despite high profile incidents by “big game hunters” such as WasteLocker and
DoppelPaymer grabbing the headlines.
