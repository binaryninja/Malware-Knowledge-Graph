Indictment of China-Based Cyber Actors
Associated with APT 41 for Intrusion Activities
Summary
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted five cyber actors based in the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) for computer intrusions affecting more
than 100 victim companies and organizations in the United States and
abroad, as well as multiple foreign governments. The actors, Zhang Haoran
and Tan Dailin, collaborated with Chengdu 404 Network Technology
company employees Qian Chuan, Fu Qiang, and Jiang Lizhi to conduct
computer network exploitation (CNE) operations originating from China.
These China-based cyber actors targeted victims in the following industries:










education;
computer hardware;
software, including video gaming;
government;
healthcare;
hospitality;
social networking;
non-governmental organizations;
telecommunications

Threat
This sophisticated hacking group located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PRC, has been active since at least
2011. The group conducted numerous computer intrusions as well as criminal for-profit computer fraud on a
global scale. The group used sophisticated tradecraft against a variety of targets, such as compromising
legitimate software for supply chain intrusions, using custom malware, deploying ransomware, and engaging
in crypto-jacking attacks. Observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the group can
be mapped to the MITRE1 Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK2) for Enterprise
framework, Version 7.0.
Technical Details
Capabilities:
The group uses a wide range of tactics in order to gain Initial Access [TA0001]. Spearphishing emails with
malicious files [T1566.001] is a common tactic for the actors. Spearphishing themes frequently target HR
departments with malicious archive files masqueraded [T1036.002] as applicant resumes. The group
historically used Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) [T1218.001] files within their spearphishing
messages. In addition, the group conducted supply chain compromises resulting in the victimization of thirdparty customers throughout the world [T1195.002]. .
These actors typically obtain means of identification, such as login credentials belonging to individuals with
administrative access to victim computer networks, to expand their unauthorized access. Additionally, the
actors may deploy legitimate third-party VPN software such as SoftEther on victim networks to facilitate
follow-on access to the victim network. The group has also deployed “Skeleton Key” malware to create a
master password that will work for any account in the domain.
During early 2020, the group conducted a massive campaign to rapidly exploit publicly identified security
vulnerabilities. This technique allowed the group to gain access into victim accounts using publicly available
exploit code against VPN services [T1133] or public facing applications [T1190] – without using their own
distinctive or identifying malware – so long as the group acted before victim companies updated their
systems. This campaign targeted organizations that did not yet patch against security vulnerabilities such as
CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-2019-1652/CVE-2019-1653, and
CVE-2020-10189. These compromises typically resulted in the installation of widely available remote access
tools like Cobalt Strike. In all cases in this campaign, the exploit code used by the group was typically several
months old.

The group has used the following malware: gh0st, 9002, Zxshell, HK Door, XSLCMD, PlugX/Sogu, Derusbi,
HiKit, Crosswalk/ProxIP, Winnti/Pasteboy/Stone/Treadstone, Azazel, PoisonPlug/Barlaiy/ShadowPad,
metasploit-meterpreter, and Cobalt Strike. The group also uses numerous webshells including China
Chopper.
One common persistence technique the group has used is DLL side-loading [T1574.002]. The group
frequently implanted malware in “%WINDIR%\Windows\System32\wbem\loadperf.dll” to side-jack of the
proper "loadperf.dll" file located in the "%WINDIR%\Windows\System32\" directory. This abuse of the
loadperf DLL used the “WMI Performance Adapter Service” (wmiAPSrv). A similar technique is used with the
“winmm.dll” file when it is not in “%WINDIR%\System32\winmm.dll”. This technique has been used to
launch HK Door, Crosswalk, and other malware.
Infrastructure:
The cyber actors typically conducted their intrusions by accessing compromised servers called hop points
from numerous China-based IP addresses resolving to different Chinese internet service providers (ISPs).
These cyber actors used US-based and foreign-based email, social media, and other online accounts to
develop online personas in order to interact with the group, other conspirators, ISPs, web hosting providers,
and victim companies.
The actors obtained the use of servers, typically by leasing remote access to them, directly or indirectly from
hosting providers. They used these servers to register and access operational email accounts, host command
and control (C2) domains, and interact with victim networks. The actors used these hop points as an
obfuscation technique when interacting with victim networks.
The actors registered and used malicious domains that mimic prominent companies in order to deceive
targeted victims, cybersecurity professionals, and cybersecurity systems into identifying Internet traffic
associated with those domains as legitimate or benign. These socially engineered domain were usually used
as C2 domains.
These actors also created “C2 dead drops” (C2DD) [T1102.001], whereby they programmed their malware to
contact these C2DD accounts on publicly available web pages. The C2DD pages were encoded with the IP
addresses of C2 servers. Specifically, C2DD pages included what might appear to be random strings of text,
with the relevant malware programmed to recognize the text strings—which typically started and/or ended
with a pre-programmed “anchor text”—converting them into actor-controlled IP addresses or C2 domains.
For example, PlugX/Sogu/Fast malware used by the group used encoded text sandwiched between “DZKS”
and “DZJS”. The malware would then cause the victim computers to communicate with the servers hosting
those IP addresses or C2 domains.

Recommended Mitigations
Patch and Vulnerability Management:






Install vendor-provided and verified patches to all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely
patching of Internet-connected servers for known vulnerabilities and software processing Internet data,
such as web browsers, browser plugins, and document readers.
Ensure proper migrating steps or compensating controls are implemented for vulnerabilities that cannot
be patched in a timely manner.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Recommend that organizations routinely audit their configuration and patch management programs to
ensure they can track and mitigate emerging threats. Implementing a rigorous configuration and patch
management program will hamper sophisticated cyber threat actors’ operations and protect
organizations’ resources and information systems.

Protect Credentials:








Strengthen credential requirements and implement multi-factor authentication to protect individual
accounts, particularly for webmail and VPN access and for accounts that access critical systems. Regularly
change passwords and do not reuse passwords for multiple accounts.
Audit all remote authentications from trusted networks or service providers.
Detect mismatches by correlating credentials used within internal networks with those employed on
external-facing systems.
Log use of system administrator commands, such as net, ipconfig, and ping.
Audit logs for suspicious behavior.
Enforce principle of least privilege.

Network Hygiene and Monitoring:










Actively scan and monitor internet-accessible applications for unauthorized access, modification, and
anomalous activities.
Actively monitor server disk use and audit for significant changes.
Log DNS queries and consider blocking all outbound DNS requests that do not originate from approved
DNS servers. Monitor DNS queries for C2 over DNS.
Develop and monitor the network and system baselines to allow for the identification of anomalous
activity. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
Use whitelist or baseline comparison to monitor Windows event logs and network traffic to detect when
a user maps a privileged administrative share on a Windows system.
Leverage multi-sourced threat-reputation services for files, DNS, URLs, IPs, and email addresses.
Network device management interfaces, such as Telnet, SSH, Winbox, and HTTP, should be turned off for
WAN interfaces and secured with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Identify and suspend
access of users exhibiting unusual activity.
When possible, segment critical information on air-gapped systems. Use strict access control measures
for critical data.
