Defender Control is a free software utility we’ve come across in various intrusions. The
creators describe it by saying the following:
What is certain however is that it [Windows Defender] will annoy users who want to
disable it permanently on the computer they are working on. Defender Control is a
small Portable freeware which will allow you to disable Windows Defender in Windows
10 completely.
While we have not seen this in many of our recent intrusions with big game ransomware, it is
common among the smaller players. Those like Dharma, Phobos, and Crysis. In our
experience, these groups’ main point of entry tends to be exposed RDP. After gaining
access, these threat actors often do not take the time or effort to fully scope, or compromise
a domain before ransoming, usually a single system. We’ve seen these threat actors get
blocked by Defender and then minutes later Defender Control gets copied over and run.
Defender Control is two files, which are a portable executable and a configuration file.

Defender Control can be run via GUI or command line
