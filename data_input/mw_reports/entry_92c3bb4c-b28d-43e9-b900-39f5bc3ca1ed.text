Numerous public proof-of-concept exploits reveal that the noPac vulnerabilities (CVE-202142278 and CVE-2021-42287) are trivial to exploit and lead to privilege escalation. Friday,

While the focus in mid-December 2021 has been on Log4j vulnerabilities, two weaponized
Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287) also
pose a serious risk to organizations. These vulnerabilities, which are collectively referred to
as noPac, enable a threat actor to gain control over a domain controller in matter of minutes.
CVE-2021-42287 is a privilege escalation vulnerability associated with the Kerberos Privilege
Attribute Certificate (PAC) in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). CVE-2021-42278 is
a Security Account Manager (SAM) spoofing security bypass vulnerability. Threat actors
could leverage these flaws to escalate to domain administrator privileges from a standard
user account.

Gaining domain administrator access
NoPac relies on changing the SamAccountName of a computer account to the name of a
domain controller. By default, every authenticated user can add up to ten computers to the
domain. The exploitation process includes the following steps:
1. Create a new computer account in Active Directory (AD) with a random name, and then
rename it to one of the domain controllers without the trailing $ (see Figure 1).

2. Request a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for the created computer account from
step one. Once the ticket is granted, change the name of the computer account back to
its original value (see Figure 2).

3. Request a Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) for the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) service using the TGT from step two with the name of the spoofed
domain controller from step one. Because there is no longer an account with that
name, TGS chooses the closest match and appends an $. Access to the service is
granted, and domain administrator access is acquired (see Figure 3).

Timing is everything
Secureworks® researchers confirmed that exploitation of the noPac vulnerability can be
accomplished in as little as 16 seconds. The following video demonstrates real-time domain
administrator access.

Potential precursor to ransomware infections
After gaining domain access, a threat actor’s ability to deploy additional malware, including
ransomware, is virtually unlimited. AD abuse is involved in most ransomware incidents
Secureworks researchers investigate. Threat actors typically leverage misconfigurations to
escalate privileges within AD. In this case, AD design flaws create the escalation path.

Conclusion
Organizations should immediately apply the applicable Microsoft patches to all domain
controllers in their environments. These patches include the November 9, 2021 releases for
CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287, as well as the November 14 out-of-band update. If
one domain controller is overlooked, the domain remains vulnerable. Organizations should
also follow Microsoft guidance to phase updates for CVE-2021-42287 and restrict users’
ability to join workstations to a domain. As of December 17, Secureworks researchers have
not observed noPac exploitation in the wild but recommend that organizations remain
vigilant.
