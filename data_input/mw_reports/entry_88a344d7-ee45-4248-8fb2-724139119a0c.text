DarkSky Botnet

Radware’s Threat Research has recently discovered a new botnet, dubbed DarkSky.
DarkSky features several evasion mechanisms, a malware downloader and a variety of
network- and application-layer DDoS attack vectors. This bot is now available for sale for
less than $20 over the Darknet.
As published by its authors, this malware is capable of running under Windows XP/7/8/10,
both x32 and x64 versions, and has anti-virtual machine capabilities to evade security
controls such as a sandbox, thereby allowing it to only infect ‘real’ machines.

Background
Radware has been monitoring this malware since its early versions in May, 2017. Developers
have been enhancing its functionality and released the latest version in December, 2017. Its
popularity and use is increasing.

On New Year’s Day, 2018, Radware witnessed a spike in different variants of the malware.
This is suspected to be the result of an increase in sales or testing of the newer version
following its launch. However all communication requests were to the same host
(“http://injbot.net/”), a strong indication of “testing” samples.

Infection Methods
Radware suspects the bot spreads via traditional means of infection such as exploit kits,
spear phishing and spam emails.

Capabilities
1. Perform DDoS Attack:
The malware is capable of performing DDoS attacks using several vectors:
DNS Amplification
TCP (SYN) Flood
UDP Flood
HTTP Flood

The server also has a “Check Host Availability” function to check if the DDoS attack
succeeded. When the malware performs HTTP DDoS attack, it uses the HTTP structure
seen below. In the binaries, Radware witnessed hard-coded lists of User-Agents and
Referers that are randomly chosen when crafting the HTTP request.

1. Downloader
The malware is capable of downloading malicious files from a remote server and executing
the downloaded files on the infected machine. After looking at the downloaded files from
several different botnets, Radware noticed cryptocurrency-related activity where some of the
files are simple Monero cryptocurrency miners and others are the latest version of the
“1ms0rry” malware associated with downloading miners and cryptocurrencies.

1. Proxy
The malware can turn the infected machine to a SOCKS/HTTP proxy to route traffic through
the infected machine to a remote server.

Malware Behavior
The malware has a quick and silent installation with almost no changes on the infected
machine. To ensure persistence on the infected machine it will either create a new key under
the registry path “RunOnce” or create a new service on the system:
1. HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\Registry Driver
2. HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Icon Codec Service\

Communication
When the malware executes, it will generate an HTTP GET request to “/activation.php?key=”
with a unique User-Agent string “2zAz.” The server will then respond with a “Fake 404 Not
Found” message if there are no commands to execute on the infected machine.

Communication Obfuscation Example
The GET request param value is base64 encrypted.

The final readable string contains infected machine information as well as user information.
When a new command is sent from the server “200 OK,” a response return is executed with
the request to download a file from the server or execute a DDoS attack (see Figure below).
Evasion
When the malware executes it will perform several anti-virtual machine checks:
1. VMware:
1. Dbghelp.dll
2. Software\Microsoft\ProductId != 76487-644-3177037-23510

5/7

2. Vbox:
1. VBoxService.exe
2. VBoxHook.dll
3. Sandboxie
1. SbieDll.dll
It will also look for the Syser kernel debugger presence searching for the following devices:
1. \\.\Syser
2. \\.\SyserDbgMsg
3. \\.\SyserBoot
