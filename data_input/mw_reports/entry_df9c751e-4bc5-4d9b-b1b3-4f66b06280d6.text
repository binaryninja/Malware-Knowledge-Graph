Over the last several days, TrustedSec has received queries on the best ways to contain,
eradicate, and remediate the SolarWinds backdoor (aka #solarigate aka Sunburst). The
TrustedSec Incident Response team has put together a playbook of recommended actions to
provide some level of assurance that your organization is no longer affected by the backdoor.
This is almost the worst-case scenario for many organizations: an advanced, statesponsored actor (may have) had an undetected backdoor into your network for months. Even
worse, the system(s) that backdoor was on had full access to your environment. Due to this,
as many others in the industry have stated, organizations have to assume they have been
fully breached. Therefore, the following playbook operates under this assumption.
Two (2) notes before we get started:
1. Even if you have already taken steps to respond, we recommend looking through this
list. There may be something you did not think of.
2. Do not blindly take all the actions below. Every organization must perform their own
due diligence of determining what the effects of the actions below are and to ensure
that the organization is OK with those effects.

1/5

Investigation
The investigation should take place concurrent to the containment, eradication, and recovery
processes. SolarWinds Orion servers should be forensically preserved, if possible, to allow
forensic examination. This includes:
Obtaining live response data, including RAM
Imaging and hashing the disk
Saving any network logs (e.g., firewall, NetFlow) of the servers before they are rolled
out
Exporting any centralized logs from the servers before they are rolled out
Since every organization’s internal visibility is different, rather than providing a list of tasks to
perform when investigating, we have compiled a list of questions that should be answered.
For any questions that cannot be answered, organizations should determine what can be put
in place in the future to sufficiently answer those questions. Timeframes for all questions
should be for as long as your organization has had SolarWinds Orion deployed, going back
to March 2020.

User Activity
The accounts mentioned below include both accounts used by SolarWinds Orion to perform
its monitoring and management, which are stored within SolarWinds, and local accounts in
the Orion server operating system.
Did accounts authenticate (successful or failed) to any systems or applications that
they should not have?
If you do not have logs that go back that far, you will have to perform a search
across locally stored logs in your environment.
Did accounts receive authentication attempts (successful or failed) from external
locations, especially those they have not logged in from before (e.g., on the VPN)?
Have accounts set off impossible travel alerts?
Are any suspicious OAUTH applications allowed Mail.Read or Mail.ReadWrite
permissions (or excessive permissions) within Office 365?

Network Activity
Have any systems connected to known command and control (C2) domains or IP
addresses?
Have any systems connected to the DNS sinkhole IP address (20.140.0.1)?
Have the servers connected to any other external domains or IP addresses?
Have the servers connected to any internal systems they should not have?
Have the servers connected to any internal systems at odd times or days?
Have any new federation trusts been added to existing Azure tenants?

2/5

Endpoint Activity
Is the backdoor Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) still present on the Orion servers?
Is the backdoor DLL on any other servers? (Hint: Use FireEye Yara signatures or
hashes of DLLs to search.)
Is there any indication of suspicious activity on the Orion servers?
Is there any indication of suspicious activity on any systems/applications whose
credentials were held within the Orion servers?
Are there any suspicious ASEPs on the servers or remote access software?
Were any accounts added or reenabled on the Orion servers or any systems or
applications to which Orion had administrative access?
Have all network device configuration files to which Orion had access been validated?
Have security software (anti-virus, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)) detected
any suspicious activity or malware on systems?

Post-Exploitation Activity
Has any post-exploitation activity been detected on any system?
FireEye reports state that Cobalt Strike has been used as a post-exploitation
payload. (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attackerleverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)
Known files include c:\windows\syswow64\netsetupsvc.dll.
Has your organization’s domain been leaked in RDP SSL certificates online? (Hint:
Check Shodan.)

Containment
Containment is the process of stopping the spread of or preventing further damage from an
attack.
1. Quarantine the SolarWinds Orion servers that have the backdoor DLL so they cannot
communicate with any other network or system. Possible options include:
1. NULL-routing their IP addresses
2. Placing the Orion servers in their own network with no access to any other
systems or the Internet
3. Utilizing EDR to contain the systems
4. Shutting down the servers
If you go this route, be sure to grab live response forensic data first—it is
better to have it and not need it than vice versa.

3/5

2. Disable any accounts utilized by SolarWinds Orion to access other devices or
communicate in your network. These include:
1. Orion platform service account
2. SQL database service account
3. Any accounts used for application/system/WMI monitoring from Orion
4. Accounts used by Orion to email/send alerts
5. SNMP community strings
3. Block network communication to the known C2 domains and IP addresses for all
systems. Possible options include:
1. DNS sinkhole domains
2. Block IP addresses at firewalls
3. Block domains and IP addresses in proxy servers
4. Turn on Sunburst-related IPS signatures
4. Block all Internet access for SolarWinds Orion servers.
5. Configure alerting for any system accessing known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) of
Sunburst or the use of any user ID that has been disabled. This should be done for
both endpoint and network monitoring.

Eradication
Eradication is the process of removing an attacker or affected system from an environment.
1. Change passwords for any account used by SolarWinds Orion. User sturdyerde posted
an excellent method to do this on SolarWinds’ community forum.
(https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/NPM-Discussions/When-you-have-to-change-allpasswords-for-the-Orion-monitoring/td-p/613340)
2. Change any shared passwords for accounts that were on the SolarWinds Orion
servers. This includes shared local account passwords or service accounts on the
system.
3. Change the passwords or community strings that are stored within Orion to perform
monitoring.
4. If this was not done in the containment phase, remove the Orion servers from the
network.

Note that instead of changing passwords for accounts, some reports have suggested that it
is faster and easier to create new accounts and remove the old accounts used in and by
SolarWinds Orion.

Recovery
Recovery is the act of bringing systems back to normal operations.

4/5

1. Back up the SolarWinds configuration and database.
1. Information on how to do this should be in the SolarWinds Orion documentation.
2. Rebuild the operating system from a known good golden image.
3. Install SolarWinds version 2020.2.1 HF 2.
(https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory)
4. Ensure security and endpoint visibility onto the server.
5. Restore the data from the backed-up configuration and database.
6. Verify the cryptographic hashes of the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll file
installed to ensure that the backdoor DLL is no longer present.
1. Hashes can be found in the Microsoft customer guidance.
Alternatively, it may not be possible to completely rebuild the server from scratch, although
this is our preferred and recommended method. If you cannot do this, perform the following:
1. Back up the SolarWinds configuration and database.
2. Install the hotfix for SolarWinds Orion 2020.2.1 HF 2.
3. Ensure security and endpoint visibility into the servers.
4. Verify the cryptographic hashes of the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll file
installed to ensure that the backdoor DLL is no longer present.
If you take the restore approach rather than the rebuild approach, you still need to perform
containment and eradication procedures!
Regardless of which approach is taken, the following recovery activities also need to occur:
1. Remove any temporary containment measures that were put into place.
2. Ensure endpoint and network alerting is configured for the following:
1. Presence of any known IoCs
2. Use of accounts in a suspicious manner (e.g., a SolarWinds service account
trying to log in to the VPN)
3. Ensure all network and endpoint security software is up to date on signatures, including
those related to Sunburst.
