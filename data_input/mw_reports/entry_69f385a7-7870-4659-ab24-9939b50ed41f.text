DarkSide Ransomware Victims Sold Short

May 14, 2021

Over the past week we have seen a considerable body of work focusing on DarkSide, the
ransomware responsible for the recent gas pipeline shutdown. Many of the excellent
technical write-ups will detail how it operates an affiliate model that supports others to be
involved within the ransomware business model (in addition to the developers). While this
may not be a new phenomenon, this model is actively deployed by many groups with great
effect. Herein is the crux of the challenge: while the attention may be on DarkSide
ransomware, the harsh reality is that equal concern should be placed at Ryuk, or REVIL, or
Babuk, or Cuba, etc. These, and other groups and their affiliates, exploit common entry
vectors and, in many cases, the tools we see being used to move within an environment are
the same. While this technical paper covers DarkSide in more detail, we must stress the
importance of implementing best practices in securing/monitoring your network. These
additional publications can guide you in doing so:

DarkSide Ransomware: What is it?
As mentioned earlier, DarkSide is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that offers high
returns for penetration-testers that are willing to provide access to networks and
distribute/execute the ransomware. DarkSide is an example of a RaaS whereby they actively
invest in development of the code, affiliates, and new features. Alongside their threat to leak
data, they have a separate option for recovery companies to negotiate, are willing to engage
with the media, and are willing to carry out a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
against victims. Those victims who do pay a ransom receive an alert from DarkSide on
companies that are on the stock exchange who are breached, in return for their payment.
Potential legal issues abound, not to mention ethical concerns, but this information could
certainly provide an advantage in short selling when the news breaks.
The group behind DarkSide are also particularly active. Using MVISION Insights we can
identify the prevalence of targets. This map clearly illustrates that the most targeted
geography is clearly the United States (at the time of writing). Further, the sectors primarily
targeted are Legal Services, Wholesale, and Manufacturing, followed by the Oil, Gas and
Chemical sectors.

Coverage and Protection Advice
McAfee’s market leading EPP solution covers DarkSide ransomware with an array of early
prevention and detection techniques.
Customers using MVISION Insights will find a threat-profile on this ransomware family that is
updated when new and relevant information becomes available.

Early Detection
MVISION EDR includes detections on many of the behaviors used in the attack including
privilege escalation, malicious PowerShell and CobaltStrike beacons, and visibility of
discovery commands, command and control, and other tactics along the attack chain. We
have EDR telemetry indicating early detection before the detonation of the Ransomware
payload.

Prevention
ENS TP provides coverage against known indicators in the latest signature set. Updates on
new indicators are pushed through GTI.
ENS ATP provides behavioral content focusing on proactively detecting the threat while also
delivering known IoCs for both online and offline detections.
ENS ATP adds two (2) additional layers of protection thanks to JTI rules that provide attack
surface reduction for generic ransomware behaviors and RealProtect (static and dynamic)
with ML models targeting ransomware threats.

Technical Analysis
The RaaS platform offers the affiliate the option to build either a Windows or Unix version of
the ransomware. Depending on what is needed, we observe that affiliates are using different
techniques to circumvent detection, by masquerading the generated Windows binaries of
DarkSide. Using several packers or signing the binary with a certificate are some of the
techniques used to do so.
As peers in our industry have described, we also observed campaigns where the affiliates
and their hacking crew used several ways to gain initial access to their victim’s network.
1. Using valid accounts, exploit vulnerabilities on servers or RDP for initial stage
2. Next, establish a beachhead in the victim’s network by using tools like Cobalt-Strike
(beacons), RealVNC, RDP ported over TOR, Putty, AnyDesk and TeamViewer.
TeamViewer is what we also see back in the config of the ransomware sample:

4/10

The configuration of the ransomware contains several options to enable or disable system
processes, but also the above part where it states which processes should not be killed.
As mentioned before, a lot of the current Windows samples in the wild are the 1.8 version of
DarkSide, others are the 2.1.2.3 version. In a chat one of the actors revealed that a V3
version will be released soon.
On March 23rd, 2021, on XSS, one of the DarkSide spokespersons announced an update of
DarkSide as a PowerShell version and a major upgrade of the Linux variant:

In the current samples we observe, we do see the PowerShell component that is used to
delete the Volume Shadow copies, for example.
1. Once a strong foothold has been established, several tools are used by the actors to
gain more privileges.
Tools observed:
Mimikatz
Dumping LSASS
IE/FireFox password dumper
Powertool64
Empire
Bypassing UAC
1. Once enough privileges are gained, it is time to map out the network and identify the
most critical systems like servers, storage, and other critical assets. A selection of the
below tools was observed to have been used in several cases:
BloodHound
ADFind
ADRecon
5/10

IP scan tools
Several Windows native tools
PowerShell scripts
Before distributing the ransomware around the network using tools like PsExec and
PowerShell, data was exfiltrated to Cloud Services that would later be used on the DarkSide
Leak page for extortion purposes. Zipping the data, using Rclone or WinSCP are some of the
examples observed.
While a lot of good and in-depth analyses are written by our peers, one thing worth noting is
that when running DarkSide, the encryption process is fast. It is one of the areas the actors
brag about on the same forum and do a comparison to convince affiliates to join their
program:

DarkSide, like Babuk ransomware, has a Linux version. Both target *nix systems but in
particular VMWare ESXi servers and storage/NAS. Storage/NAS is critical for many
companies, but how many of you are running a virtual desktop, hosted on a ESXi server?
Darkside wrote a Linux variant that supports the encryption of ESXI server versions 5.0 – 7.1
as well as NAS technology from Synology. They state that other NAS/backup technologies
will be supported soon.
In the code we clearly observe this support:

6/10

Also, the configuration of the Linux version shows it is clearly looking for Virtual Disk/memory
kind of files:

Although the adversary recently claimed to vote for targets, the attacks are ongoing with
packed and signed samples observed as recently as today (May 12, 2021):

Conclusion
Recently the Ransomware Task Force, a partnership McAfee is proud to be a part of,
released a detailed paper on how ransomware attacks are occurring and how
countermeasures should be taken. As many of us have published, presented on, and
released research upon, it is time to act. Please follow the links included within this blog to
apply the broader advice about applying available protection and detection in your
environment against such attacks.
