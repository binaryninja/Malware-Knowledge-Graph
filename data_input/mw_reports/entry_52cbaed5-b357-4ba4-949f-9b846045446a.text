Threat actors pivot their tactics to exploit perceived COVID-19 information vacuums,
increased reliance on remote conferencing platforms, and victims’ fears. Wednesday, April 8,

The ongoing COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic is creating challenges for
organizations and individuals around the world. Most organizations have implemented
remote working for their employees where possible. This transition changes how employees
access data and communicate with colleagues and customers. That change creates an
opportunity for threat actors who seek to exploit the situation for financial gain or intelligence
gathering.
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers are tracking multiple coronavirusthemed campaigns across customer telemetry and third-party reporting. As of this
publication, there has not been a noticeable increase in detections across customers’
managed security controls since the beginning of 2020. However, there is clear evidence of
well-established cybercriminal and government-sponsored threat actors leveraging general
interest in COVID-19 to entice victims to open malicious links and attachments. CTU™
researchers have observed government-sponsored hackers weaponizing coronavirusthemed Office documents and sophisticated criminal operators targeting critical infrastructure
and organizations in areas hit hard by the pandemic.
The international response to the pandemic will be the subject of intelligence focus for some
countries, as they seek to understand what other countries and international organizations
are doing, saying, and thinking beyond public statements. This focus has likely shifted
targeting requirements for some intelligence agencies and their associated cyberespionage
operations. For example, Iranian government-sponsored threat actors reportedly attempted
to infiltrate the World Health Organization.
Meanwhile, traditional cyberespionage activity continues. There have been many examples
of government-sponsored actors incorporating the COVID-19 situation into their standard
targeting operations:

Word documents using Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and English language coronavirusthemed lures in February and March have been attributed to BRONZE PRESIDENT
(also known as Mustang Panda).

CTU researchers analyzed a malicious RTF document in February linked to threat
actors suspected to be based in China. This purported update from the Mongolian
Ministry of Health on the global COVID-19 situation (see Figure 1) dropped the
PoisonIvy remote access trojan.

The Pakistan-based COPPER FIELDSTONE threat group (also known as APT36)
reportedly leveraged the coronavirus pandemic in a lure document supposedly from the
government of India. The document dropped the threat group’s signature CrimsonRAT
malware.
In March, a file named “COVID-19 and North Korea.docx” was uploaded to the
VirusTotal analysis service and was observed contacting a command and control (C2)
domain associated with the North Korean NICKEL KIMBALL threat group (also known
as Kimsuky).
On April 3, researchers noted a COVID-themed malicious document (maldoc) that
used a C2 domain linked to the TILDEN threat group (also known as Gamaredon).
CTU researchers assess that TILDEN may be associated with Russian intelligence
services.

Well-resourced cyberespionage groups can rapidly adapt their targeting to take advantage of
emerging opportunities. Due to public interest in COVID-19, spearphishing attacks using this
theme are more likely to be successful. It is highly likely that threat groups will also explore
their targets’ increased attack surface as employees transition to working from home and the
uptake in remote access and conferencing solutions continues.
Although hostile foreign intelligence services might not factor into every organization’s threat
model, all organizations should consider risks posed by financially motivated cybercriminals.
Those groups have also quickly pivoted to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic:

The Italian government implemented quarantines in Lombardy and 14 other affected
provinces on March 8 and then extended the lockdown nationwide on March 10 in
response to rising numbers of infections. On March 2 and 3, when it was clear that Italy
was facing a challenge in containing the spread of the disease, several high-volume
Italian-language spam campaigns began distributing the TrickBot malware. On March
13, CTU researchers observed Italian banks being added to TrickBot web inject
configurations. This timing could be a coincidence, or GOLD BLACKBURN could have
recognized that social isolation might result in an increased dependency on online
banking.
In late February, REvil ransom notes containing the names of Italian manufacturing
companies began to appear. It is possible that one or more REvil affiliates are
deliberately targeting organizations that might be more susceptible to extortion
because they are already facing an extremely challenging economic outlook.
A legitimate coronavirus tracking map was weaponized with the AZORult informationstealing malware and sold on underground forums.
The LokiBot information stealer has been dropped via a maldoc that uses a World
Health Organization theme.
An email sent in March claiming to provide tips on how to avoid COVID-19 scams
delivered the Gozi ISFB (also known as Ursnif) banking trojan.
Threat actors have purportedly attempted to brute force Linksys routers so they could
modify DNS records to redirect network traffic to a coronavirus-themed malicious
website delivering the Oski stealer malware.
The corona live 1.1 app claims to track the coronavirus but actually delivers the
commercially available SpyMax spyware in a campaign targeting Libyans.

The fundamental business model and revenue generation of these sophisticated criminal
groups does not really change as a result of the global pandemic. But fear, uncertainty, and a
thirst for information about the current situation increases the number of potential victims and
the likelihood of successful attacks.

Some threat actors have granted the healthcare sector a partial reprieve from this activity.
GOLD VILLAGE, which operates the Maze ransomware, stated on March 18 that it would no
longer target healthcare. However, the threat actors subsequently advertised compromised
healthcare organizations. Since March 24, the GOLD TAHOE threat group, which operates
the Clop ransomware, has included a message on its public name-and-shame website that
the group will not target healthcare. It is perhaps too early to determine if there is some
honor among thieves.
The activity receiving the most public attention includes spoofed domains, disruptive acts
targeting remote conferencing services, and other scams. Unlike some of the threats
discussed earlier in this blog post, the challenge for security teams in these incidents is
identifying the malicious activity amid the noise.

Over 90,000 coronavirus-themed domains that included terms such as covid, corona,
chineseflu, and wuhan were created between January 1 and April 1. The vast majority
of these domains will not be linked to active cybercrime or targeted activity, but some
undoubtedly will be.
Threat actors are taking advantage of increased teleconferencing use, spoofing
legitimate applications to deliver malware and creating malicious domains imitating
platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Hangouts.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of teleconferencing services
being hijacked (also known as Zoom-bombing), noting incidents in two U.S. schools. A
significant proportion of activity targeting remote conferencing services will be
opportunistic and intended to cause minor disruption. However, sophisticated threat
actors will try to find and exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in those platforms.
Threat actors created sextortion emails that threaten to infect the victim’s family
members with coronavirus if a payment of $4,000 USD is not received. While these
threats cannot be fulfilled, they may be convincing enough to scare victims.
The FBI identified an SMS phishing (smishing) campaign that appeared to be a
message from consumer products wholesaler Costco. The message offered money for
completing a survey, but the survey is hosted on a malicious website.
Alleged government-funding opportunities have been advertised through Facebook
Messenger. These scams instruct the recipient to pay $20 USD for shipping of a “grant”
check that never arrives.

CTU researchers recommend that organizations apply the following mitigations for
coronavirus-themed threats. Many of these security practices protect organizations against
other threats as well.
Train employees to recognize and report phishing and other scams. These attempts
could leverage via email, phone, social media, SMS (text), or other messaging
applications.

Conduct regular vulnerability scans, particularly of Internet-facing infrastructure. Ensure
that devices and applications are centrally managed, are installed from known-good
media, and are regularly patched.
Use multi-factor authentication where possible. Requiring additional authentication
elements makes it difficult for threat actors to gain access using stolen user credentials.
Implement endpoint and network monitoring controls to detect malicious activity. Focus
on detecting and investigating unusual activity from weaponized files, such as
launching PowerShell, WMI, WScript, or unusual network communications.
Where possible, require users to connect through corporate resources such as virtual
private networks (VPNs) and DNS servers to access the Internet. This approach
provides additional monitoring opportunities if user endpoints are compromised.
Consider the organization’s security requirements when selecting a remote
conferencing tool and vendor to ensure that the tool allows for an appropriate level of
protection for conversations and data.
Issue guidance to employees regarding proper use of remote conferencing services.
Use passcodes or other authentication features, and do not publicly disclose meeting
IDs where possible.
Review incident response plans to ensure that remain appropriate for the modified
work environment. Consider how to test those plans without adding unnecessary stress
to the organization.
Select a full-service threat intelligence provider, or several complementary ones, that
offers coverage to support the organization’s threat model and that reduces the
potential of internal security teams spending their time chasing false leads.
