Although there continues to be an overall decrease in EK activity I’m still seeing a decent
amount of malvertising leading to EKs. One campaign that I run into a lot is Seamless. It’s
like other malvertising campaigns in that much of the traffic originates from streaming video
sites. These kinds of sites make good targets for threat actors as they get a lot of traffic and,
more importantly, they often have poor advertising standards. The site I used for this infection
chain is in Alexa’s top 900 global sites and top 800 for the United States. Further analysis
reveals that the site received an estimated 13,970,000 visits over the last 30 days. That’s a
lot of potential victims.
Below is a very basic flowchart of the infection chain:

Below is a breakdown of each of the events leading to the Seamless campaign and then to
RIG EK.

2/16

Syndication.exdynsrv.com returns a 302 Found and points to a new location
at tqbeu.voluumtrk.com. This subdomain uses Voluum’s
web analytics system to collect statistical data.
We then see a GET request for a resource located at tqbeu.voluumtrk.com. The server
responds with 302 Found and points to the Seamless infrastructure at 194[.]58[.]38[.]50/usa:

194[.]58[.]38[.]50/usa redirects to 194[.]58[.]38[.]50/usa/:

JavaScript gets the time zone information from the user:

Time zone information is POSTed back to the server. The server responds with script that
redirects the host back to another resource located at tqbeu.voluumtrk.com:

4/16

Traffic is being filtered at this point, with unwanted traffic being redirected to benign sites that
break the infection chain.
Continuing with the infection chain we see tqbeu.voluumtrk.com redirect to
tqbeu.redirectvoluum.com:

This time the URL contains some Base64 encoded data, which decodes to the Seamless
gate:

The Seamless gate returns an iframe containing the location of the RIG EK landing page:

Seamless continues to drop Ramnit (qzsn3aad.exe found in %TEMP%) via RIG EK. Postinfection Ramnit traffic shows DNS queries for DGA domains:

Active C2 traffic via TCP port 443:
185.118.65.143 – hdyejdn638ir8.com
46.17.44.131 – eppixrakqeueuttiuvi.com
185.159.129.127 and 194.58.112.174 – tmgmgjcvt.com
After the initial malware payload dropped I decided to restart my host and noticed additional
downloads for “satbin.exe” (AKA V3.exe and javasch.exe), “AU2_EXEsd.exe” and
“Loader.exe” (AKA Lw321.exe), which were all located at steelskull[.]com.

Steelskull.com, created on 11/16/2015, appears to be a hacked site that sells steel Biker jewelry in the
shape of skulls.

Below is an image of the GET and POST requests associated with the malvertising
chain, RIG EK activity, additional downloads, and the post-infection traffic:

6/16

The first GET request for additional files after I restarted my host was for satbin.exe. Running
satbin.exe (AKA V3.exe and javasch.exe) generated POST requests to
103.253.27.234/teststeal/gate.php. The User-Agent used during these POST requests
was “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET
CLR 2.0.50727).” We can also see it using api.ipify.org to grab the host external IP address.

Further research shows that satbin.exe (AKA V3.exe – found in %LOCALAPPDATA% and
javasch.exe – found in %APPDATA%) dropped javasch.js in %APPDATA%:

Opening javasch.js.txt in Notepad++ shows a lot of garbage, however, switching the
language to JavaScript quickly reveals the real code:

The second GET request for additional files after I restarted my host was
for AU2_EXEsd.exe, which was identified by @Antelox (thanks again!) as AZORult Stealer.

Post-infection traffic caused by AZORult shows POST requests to parkingservices.us/gate.php, which currently resolves to 185.100.222.41.

The third download was for Loader.exe (AKA Lw321.exe), which was identified by HybridAnalysis and @Antelox as Smoke Loader. Post-infection traffic from this sample shows
POST requests to zabugrom.bit/smk2/ – resolving to 109.169.89.50.
