On December 13th, 2020, FireEye, Microsoft, and SolarWinds announced the discovery of a
large, sophisticated supply chain attack leveraging Orion IT, an infrastructure monitoring and
management platform by SolarWinds.
Many publications have followed up on this major incident and the research is still ongoing.
While technical details of the SunBurst backdoor embedded into SolarWinds have already
been described and second-stage tools are being discovered, the scale of the attack and the
interest of the actor behind the attack are still being investigated. It has been officially
confirmed that about 18,000 users may have installed backdoored versions of SolarWinds.
Still, there is limited information on the number of organizations where the attack has evolved
and second-stage tools may have been deployed, though there are some speculations on
the actor’s interest based on an analysis of the historical C2 DNS response (see here and
here).

We were specifically interested in analyzing how many industrial organizations used
backdoored SolarWinds versions and fell victim to the attack. The results of the analysis are
below.
First of all, we analyzed all available decoded internal domain names obtained from DNS
names generated by the SunBurst DomainName Generation Algorithm using some publicly
available lists and third-party lists. The final list of readable and attributable domains
consisted of nearly 2000 domain names and information on the industries in which possibly
compromised industrial organizations operate is provided below:
The overall percentage of industrial organizations among all organizations on the list is
estimated at 32.4%.

We also analysed user information from our telemetry where the backdoored SolarWinds
applications were installed and distinguished over 20 organizations in the industrial sector:
manufacturing

8

transportation & logistics

6

utilities

4

construction

4

mining

3

The geographical distribution of the industrial organizations is broad and includes the
following countries and territories: Benin, Canada, Chile, Djibouti, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Uganda,
and the USA. At the same time, the geography of all victims covers almost the entire world,
from North America to APAC.
The SolarWinds software is highly integrated into many systems around the globe in different
industries. We currently have no evidence that any of the industrial organizations in our
telemetry had an escalation from the attackers. Truesec provided a list of possible secondstage victims, which included several industrial organizations headquartered in different
countries, based on responses received from a server used by the threat actor. Thus, we
shouldn’t rule out the possibility of wider activity in some of the industrial networks if it is in
line with the actor’s interests.
Here are our recommendations for possible victims of the SolarWinds compromise:
1. Check whether backdoored SolarWinds versions are installed. Known affected versions
include software builds 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no hotfix installed, and 2020.2 HF1.
2. Check for known indicators of compromise (IOCs). CISA has published Alert AA20-35A
with an extensive list
3. If you have detected a compromised SolarWinds installation or related IOCs, initiate a
security incident investigation and launch an incident response procedure, considering
all possible attack vectors:
1. Isolate assets that are known to be compromised, while keeping the system
operable
2. Prevent IOCs that could be useful for the investigation from being deleted
3. Check all network logs for suspicious network activity
4. Check system logs and journals for illegitimate user account authentication
5. Locate suspicious process activity, investigate memory dumps and associated
files
6. Check historical command-line data associated with suspicious activity
4. If you consider yourself a victim of the SolarWinds compromise, you can reach us at

Update 28.01.2021
Netresec has pointed out the fact that the TrueSec list of possible second-stage victims is
incorrect due to their methodology and provided its own list based on updated information
on the C2 logic of picking 2nd stage victims. The Netresec list also contains several
industrial-related victims.
