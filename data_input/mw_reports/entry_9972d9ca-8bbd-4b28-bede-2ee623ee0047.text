Tor
Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet
communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.

3/8

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download
the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X
and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.
Tails
If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the
submission system through a secure operating system called Tails. Tails is an operating
system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer
is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will
require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop
computer.

Tips
Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also
take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines.
1. Contact us if you have specific problems
If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a highrisk source, please contact us. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom
solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.
2. What computer to use
If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation,
consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use Tails to
help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.
3. Do not talk about your submission to others
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it
is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise
to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.
How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After Submitting

1. Do not talk about your submission to others

is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise

4/8

2. Act normal
If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which
might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and
behaviour.
3. Remove traces of your submission
If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or
uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you
format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.
In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital
forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data
even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to
destroy the media.
If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the
clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.
4. If you face legal action
If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations
that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the
protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at https://www.couragefound.org.

Submit documents to WikiLeaks
WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or
otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.
The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your
documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor.
(See our Tor tab for more information.) We also advise you to read our tips for sources
before submitting.
http://ibfckmpsmylhbfovflajicjgldsqpc75k5w454irzwlh7qifgglncbad.onion
If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements,
WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. Contact us to discuss how to proceed.

Vault 8
Source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7
series.

5/8

This publication will enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public
to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.
Source code published in this series contains software designed to run on servers controlled
by the CIA. Like WikiLeaks' earlier Vault7 series, the material published by WikiLeaks does
not contain 0-days or similar security vulnerabilities which could be repurposed by others.

Hive
9 November, 2017
Today, 9 November 2017, WikiLeaks publishes the source code and development logs to
Hive, a major component of the CIA infrastructure to control its malware.
Hive solves a critical problem for the malware operators at the CIA. Even the most
sophisticated malware implant on a target computer is useless if there is no way for it to
communicate with its operators in a secure manner that does not draw attention. Using Hive
even if an implant is discovered on a target computer, attributing it to the CIA is difficult by

6/8

just looking at the communication of the malware with other servers on the internet. Hive
provides a covert communications platform for a whole range of CIA malware to send
exfiltrated information to CIA servers and to receive new instructions from operators at the
CIA.
Hive can serve multiple operations using multiple implants on target computers. Each
operation anonymously registers at least one cover domain (e.g. "perfectly-boring-lookingdomain.com") for its own use. The server running the domain website is rented from
commercial hosting providers as a VPS (virtual private server) and its software is customized
according to CIA specifications. These servers are the public-facing side of the CIA back-end
infrastructure and act as a relay for HTTP(S) traffic over a VPN connection to a "hidden" CIA
server called 'Blot'.

The cover domain delivers 'innocent' content if somebody browses it by chance. A visitor will
not suspect that it is anything else but a normal website. The only peculiarity is not visible to
non-technical users - a HTTPS server option that is not widely used: Optional Client
Authentication. But Hive uses the uncommon Optional Client Authentication so that the user
browsing the website is not required to authenticate - it is optional. But implants talking to
Hive do authenticate themselves and can therefore be detected by the Blot server. Traffic

7/8

from implants is sent to an implant operator management gateway called Honeycomb (see
graphic above) while all other traffic go to a cover server that delivers the insuspicious
content for all other users.
Digital certificates for the authentication of implants are generated by the CIA impersonating
existing entities. The three examples included in the source code build a fake certificate for
the anti-virus company Kaspersky Laboratory, Moscow pretending to be signed by Thawte
Premium Server CA, Cape Town. In this way, if the target organization looks at the network
traffic coming out of its network, it is likely to misattribute the CIA exfiltration of data to
uninvolved entities whose identities have been impersonated.
The documentation for Hive is available from the WikiLeaks Vault7 series.
