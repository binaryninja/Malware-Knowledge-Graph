Key Findings
An anonymous author on the hydra[.]expert domain claimed to have uncovered the
true identities of the individuals running the Hydra marketplace, one of the largest
Russian-language dark web markets for drugs. Gemini has translated and analyzed
this investigation, although we have not confirmed the entirety of the evidence.
The anonymous author alleges that Bogdan Koliesniev and Alexander Dyriavin, both
Ukrainian citizens, are responsible for Hydra’s operations. Gemini has confirmed only
some of the author’s findings.

This anonymous post began with the author purporting to have attempted to blackmail
these individuals for monetary gain. According to the author, these individuals did not
pay, so the author decided to reveal their identities. Telegra.ph forum user “monarkhov,”
who claims to be Bogdan Koliesniev, denied his connection to Hydra.
Based on an analysis of the anonymous author’s investigation, Gemini Advisory
assesses with moderate confidence that Bogdan Koliesniev is likely one of the
perpetrators behind the Hydra dark market due to significant evidence pointing to this
individual related to shared infrastructure and linked contact information. However,
Gemini assesses with low confidence that Alexander Dyriavin may be involved with
Hydra, although likely at a lower level with indirect contributions to their operations.

Background
Gemini analysts have found a post by an anonymous author on the hydra[.]expert domain
claiming to have uncovered the true identities of the individuals running Hydra, one of the
largest Russian-language dark web marketplaces for drugs. While formerly part of Hydra’s
infrastructure, hydra[.]expert now appears to be solely dedicated to identifying Hydra’s
operators. Gemini has translated and analyzed the investigation pointing to the identities of
Hydra’s alleged operators, although we have not confirmed the entirety of the evidence. The
post circulated among multiple dark web channels, including an anonymous image forum
and a Telegram channel. It has also reached Russian-language media
Hydra
Hydra was founded in 2015, and gradually conquered the market for illegal goods. The
platform has become one of the largest in the world and is the single largest platform for the
sale of drugs in the Former Soviet Union (FSU). It serves as an intermediary between sellers
and buyers; while it mainly focuses on the sale of drugs, it also has a section on counterfeit
bank notes, hacking services, counterfeit documents, and other prohibited items. As of this
writing, there are 2.5 million accounts registered on the platform and the number of accounts
grows every month.

In-Depth Analysis
OperationsBlockchain analysis company Chainalysis examined the Bitcoin wallets
associated with this market and estimated that over the lifetime of the shop, there were at
least $3.4 billion worth of transactions. The Hydra market has also had $1,260,875 in
transactions with three crypto currency exchanges. While only about $430,000 in direct
exposure could be confirmed with one large international exchange, its indirect sending
exposure was much larger – $1,875,000 USD. Such activities could indicate that the
market’s operators were using legitimate exchanges to launder some of the illicit profits.

The Investigation
According to the post on hydra[.]expert, Bogdan Koliesniev (Kolesnev) and Alexander
Dyriavin (Daryavin), both citizens of Ukraine, are responsible for Hydra’s operations. The
post’s author claims to have conducted an analysis after a distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack hit Hydra, and purportedly uncovered JavaScript code installed on the
marketplace. The author’s investigation included the following key points, only some of which
Gemini has confirmed:
The JavaScript code was connected to the domain name z[.]team.
Analysis of z[.]team subdomain qp[.]z[.]team revealed a .json file. The analysis of this
file revealed that it was created by “Askold Monarkhov,” and also included the email
address. Analysis of the subdomain git[.]z[.]team revealed another name, Alexander
Dyriavin.
A search for the above email address led to the GitHub page of “ASKOLDEX,” which
also displays the name of Bogdan Kolesnev as an event bug fixer.
A search for ASKOLDEX reveals a YouTube page that has video tutorials on creating
Telegram bots and the management of QIWI panels, as well as other videos.
Additional searches revealed a VK social media page for Askold Monarkhov.
A Whois record search for the above email indicated that it was used to register the
domain name monarkhov[.]pro with the registration name is Bogdan Koliesniev.
Additional personally identifiable information (PII) was obtained on Bogdan Kolesnev,
such as his passport number and telephone number.

A search for Alexander Dyriavin revealed a profile for an individual with the same name
on GitHub. Their Github profile page also indicated that Dyriavin worked with
ASKOLDEX.
Additional searches revealed Alexander Dyriavin’s email address, social media
accounts, and other PII.
The post noted additional links between uncovered IP addresses and various domains,
and various directory name overlaps.

Blackmail
It is worth pointing out that this anonymous post began with the author claiming to have
attempted to blackmail these individuals for monetary gain. According to the author, these
individuals did not pay, so the author decided to reveal their identities. It is also worth noting
that according to WaybackMachine, in 2018 hydra[.]expert used to be a mirror domain of the
Hydra market on the surface web, however, it remains unclear if this was the official mirror of
the actual Hydra market, which was primarily hosted in the dark web. Furthermore, according
to Whois records, the domain hydra[.]expert was recently purchased, which could indicate
that it was purchased for the sole purpose of posting this research.
It Wasn’t Me
On the same day as this post, on Telegra.ph, which is a Russian-language forum for
anonymous posts, user “monarkhov” created a post claiming to be Bogdan Koliesniev
(hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Kak-ya-stal-razrabotchikom-Gidry-bez-registracii-i-sms-02-19). The user
monarkhov indicated that the investigation’s findings were incorrect and that they have
nothing to do with Hydra. User monarkhov claimed that they create the framework for making
Telegram bots and create admin panels to control Qiwi wallets. Additionally, monarkhov
claimed that many of their source codes are available on Github and that anyone could have
used them. This purportedly explains why Hydra used infrastructure linked to Koliesniev,
although it does not explain why Hydra specifically chose Koliesniev’s code.

Conclusion
Based on an analysis of the anonymous author’s investigation, Gemini Advisory assesses
with moderate confidence that Bogdan Koliesniev is likely one of the perpetrators behind the
Hydra dark market due to significant evidence pointing to this individual related to shared
infrastructure and linked contact information. However, Gemini assesses with low confidence
that Alexander Dyriavin may be involved with Hydra, although likely at a lower level with
indirect contributions to their operations.
