May 24, 2021

The ASEC analysis team has recently found out that the Vidar info-stealer malware is
abusing a game matching program named Faceit to create C&C server URL. Vidar is
malware that has been steadily distributed from the past disguised as spam mail, PUP, and
KMSAuto authentication tool.
Before it performs info-stealing activities, it connects to C&C server to receive commands
and download additional DLL files to collect user information. In the past, the malware simply
connected to C&C server and received commands and additional files like other malware.
Yet the recent Vidar abuses online gaming platforms to actually create C&C server.
Faceit is a platform which supports game matching for online game users. It supports various
online games such as PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS, DOTA 2, and Counter
Strike: Global Offensive.

List of games supported by Faceit
As for Vidar abusing the platform, it first creates an API URL for faceit.com before
communicating with the C&C server. The URL created by the routine shown below is as
follows: ‘sslamlssa’ is the attacker’s Faceit ID.
– hxxps://api.faceit[.]com/core/v1/nicknames/sslamlssa

2/6

Routine for

creating C&C URL
When Vidar requests HTTP GET for the URL shown above, it receives the json format data
from faceit.com. The malware parses the ‘about’ part in the data, which is the actual URL for
the C&C server.
– hxxp://188.34.193[.]205

Data received from faceit.com

API result for the malicious user

When logged in to faceit.com, the malware’s C&C server address is shown in the ABOUT
part of the profile page of the user ‘sslamlssa’.

Malicious user’s profile
If the attacker edits the About part and enters another address, the Vidar info-stealer will
connect to the changed C&C server and continue to perform malicious activities. If Faceit’s
attacker account is not blocked, the attacker can repeatedly edit the C&C server to make the
same malware connect to different C&C servers. It is likely that the attacker is using the
method to bypass network detection for the C&C URL.
Vidar connects to the actual C&C servers established and receives DLL files needed for
commands and info-stealing, and ultimately sends the stolen information to the C&C server.
See the data sent below, which shows that Vidar’s version is v38.6.

Vidar’s network behavior
When a suspicious-looking email arrives, users should not open the attachment file, try to
use a genuine software at all times, and refrain from using suspicious websites and P2P.
Also, update V3 to the latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.
AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware using the following
aliases:
