Human-operated ransomware attacks: A preventable
disaster

March 5, 2020

Human-operated ransomware campaigns pose a significant and growing threat to
businesses and represent one of the most impactful trends in cyberattacks today. In these
hands-on-keyboard attacks, which are different from auto-spreading ransomware like
WannaCry or NotPetya, adversaries employ credential theft and lateral movement methods
traditionally associated with targeted attacks like those from nation-state actors. They exhibit
extensive knowledge of systems administration and common network security
misconfigurations, perform thorough reconnaissance, and adapt to what they discover in a
compromised network.

services; here’s how to reduce risk

These attacks are known to take advantage of network configuration weaknesses and
vulnerable services to deploy ransomware payloads. And while ransomware is the very
visible action taken in these attacks, human operators also deliver other malicious payloads,
steal credentials, and access and exfiltrate data from compromised networks.
News about ransomware attacks often focus on the downtimes they cause, the ransom
payments, and the details of the ransomware payload, leaving out details of the oftentimes
long-running campaigns and preventable domain compromise that allow these humanoperated attacks to succeed.
Based on our investigations, these campaigns appear unconcerned with stealth and have
shown that they could operate unfettered in networks. Human operators compromise
accounts with higher privileges, escalate privilege, or use credential dumping techniques to
establish a foothold on machines and continue unabated in infiltrating target environments.
Human-operated ransomware campaigns often start with “commodity malware” like banking
Trojans or “unsophisticated” attack vectors that typically trigger multiple detection alerts;
however, these tend to be triaged as unimportant and therefore not thoroughly investigated
and remediated. In addition, the initial payloads are frequently stopped by antivirus solutions,

1/20

but attackers just deploy a different payload or use administrative access to disable the
antivirus without attracting the attention of incident responders or security operations centers
(SOCs).
Some well-known human-operated ransomware campaigns include REvil, Samas,
Bitpaymer, and Ryuk. Microsoft actively monitors these and other long-running humanoperated ransomware campaigns, which have overlapping attack patterns. They take
advantage of similar security weaknesses, highlighting a few key lessons in security, notably
that these attacks are often preventable and detectable.
Combating and preventing attacks of this nature requires a shift in mindset, one that focuses
on comprehensive protection required to slow and stop attackers before they can succeed.
Human-operated attacks will continue to take advantage of security weaknesses to deploy
destructive attacks until defenders consistently and aggressively apply security best
practices to their networks. In this blog, we will highlight case studies of human-operated
ransomware campaigns that use different entrance vectors and post-exploitation techniques
but have overwhelming overlap in the security misconfigurations they abuse and the impact
they have on organizations.

PARINACOTA group: Smash-and-grab monetization campaigns
One actor that has emerged in this trend of human-operated attacks is an active, highly
adaptive group that frequently drops Wadhrama as payload. Microsoft has been tracking this
group for some time, but now refers to them as PARINACOTA, using our new naming
designation for digital crime actors based on global volcanoes.
PARINACOTA impacts three to four organizations every week and appears quite resourceful:
during the 18 months that we have been monitoring it, we have observed the group change
tactics to match its needs and use compromised machines for various purposes, including
cryptocurrency mining, sending spam emails, or proxying for other attacks. The group’s goals
and payloads have shifted over time, influenced by the type of compromised infrastructure,
but in recent months, they have mostly deployed the Wadhrama ransomware.
The group most often employs a smash-and-grab method, whereby they attempt to infiltrate
a machine in a network and proceed with subsequent ransom in less than an hour. There are
outlier campaigns in which they attempt reconnaissance and lateral movement, typically
when they land on a machine and network that allows them to quickly and easily move
throughout the environment.
PARINACOTA’s attacks typically brute forces their way into servers that have Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposed to the internet, with the goal of moving laterally inside a
network or performing further brute-force activities against targets outside the network. This
allows the group to expand compromised infrastructure under their control. Frequently, the

2/20

group targets built-in local administrator accounts or a list of common account names. In
other instances, the group targets Active Directory (AD) accounts that they compromised or
have prior knowledge of, such as service accounts of known vendors.
The group adopted the RDP brute force technique that the older ransomware called Samas
(also known as SamSam) infamously used. Other malware families like GandCrab,
MegaCortext, LockerGoga, Hermes, and RobbinHood have also used this method in
targeted ransomware attacks. PARINACOTA, however, has also been observed to adapt to
any path of least resistance they can utilize. For instance, they sometimes discover
unpatched systems and use disclosed vulnerabilities to gain initial access or elevate
privileges.

Figure 1. PARINACOTA infection chain

3/20

We gained insight into these attacks by investigating compromised infrastructure that the
group often utilizes to proxy attacks onto their next targets. To find targets, the group scans
the internet for machines that listen on RDP port 3389. The attackers do this from
compromised machines using tools like Masscan.exe, which can find vulnerable machines
on the entire internet in under six minutes.
Once a vulnerable target is found, the group proceeds with a brute force attack using tools
like NLbrute.exe or ForcerX, starting with common usernames like ‘admin’, ‘administrator’,
‘guest’, or ‘test’. After successfully gaining access to a network, the group tests the
compromised machine for internet connectivity and processing capacity. They determine if
the machine meets certain requirements before using it to conduct subsequent RDP brute
force attacks against other targets. This tactic, which has not been observed being used by
similar ransomware operators, gives them access to additional infrastructure that is less
likely to be blocked. In fact, the group has been observed leaving their tools running on
compromised machines for months on end.
On machines that the group doesn’t use for subsequent RDP brute-force attacks, they
proceed with a separate set of actions. This technique helps the attackers evade reputationbased detection, which may block their scanning boxes; it also preserves their commandand-control (C2) infrastructure. In addition, PARINACOTA utilizes administrative privileges
gained via stolen credentials to turn off or stop any running services that might lead to their
detection. Tamper protection in Microsoft Defender ATP prevents malicious and unauthorized
to settings, including antivirus solutions and cloud-based detection capabilities.
After disabling security solutions, the group often downloads a ZIP archive that contains
dozens of well-known attacker tools and batch files for credential theft, persistence,
reconnaissance, and other activities without fear of the next stages of the attack being
prevented. With these tools and batch files, the group clears event logs using wevutil.exe, as
well as conducts extensive reconnaissance on the machine and the network, typically
looking for opportunities to move laterally using common network scanning tools. When
necessary, the group elevates privileges from local administrator to SYSTEM using
accessibility features in conjunction with a batch file or exploit-laden files named after the
specific CVEs they impact, also known as the “Sticky Keys” attack.
The group dumps credentials from the LSASS process, using tools like Mimikatz and
ProcDump, to gain access to matching local administrator passwords or service accounts
with high privileges that may be used to start as a scheduled task or service, or even used
interactively. PARINACOTA then uses the same remote desktop session to exfiltrate
acquired credentials. The group also attempts to get credentials for specific banking or
financial websites, using findstr.exe to check for cookies associated with these sites.

4/20

Figure 2. Microsoft Defender ATP alert for credential theft
With credentials on hand, PARINACOTA establishes persistence using various methods,
including:
Registry modifications using .bat or .reg files to allow RDP connections

Setting up access through existing remote assistance apps or installing a backdoor

5/20

Creating new local accounts and adding them to the local administrators group

To determine the type of payload to deploy, PARINACOTA uses tools like Process Hacker to
identify active processes. The attackers don’t always install ransomware immediately; they
have been observed installing coin miners and using massmail.exe to run spam campaigns,
essentially using corporate networks as distributed computing infrastructure for profit. The
group, however, eventually returns to the same machines after a few weeks to install
ransomware.
The group performs the same general activities to deliver the ransomware payload:
Plants a malicious HTA file (hta in many instances) using various autostart extensibility
points (ASEPs), but often the registry Run keys or the Startup folder. The HTA file
displays ransom payment instructions.
Deletes local backups using tools like exe to stifle recovery of ransomed files.
Stops active services that might interfere with encryption using exe, net.exe, or other
tools.

6/20

Figure 3. PARINACOTA stopping services and processes
Drops an array of malware executables, often naming the files based on their intended
behavior. If previous attempts to stop antivirus software have been unsuccessful, the
group simply drops multiple variants of a malware until they manage to execute one
that is not detected, indicating that even when detections and alerts are occurring,
network admins are either not seeing them or not reacting to them.
As mentioned, PARINACOTA has recently mostly dropped the Wadhrama ransomware,
which leaves the following ransom note after encrypting target files:

7/20

Figure 4. Wadhrama ransom note
In several observed cases, targeted organizations that were able to resolve ransomware
infections were unable to fully remove persistence mechanisms, allowing the group to come
back and deploy ransomware again.

Figure 5. Microsoft Defender ATP machine view showing reinfection by Wadhrama

8/20

PARINACOTA routinely uses Monero coin miners on compromised machines, allowing them
to collect uniform returns regardless of the type of machine they access. Monero is popular
among cybercriminals for its privacy benefits: Monero not only restricts access to wallet
balances, but also mixes in coins from other transactions to help hide the specifics of each
transaction, resulting in transactions that aren’t as easily traceable by amount as other digital
currencies.
As for the ransomware component, we have seen reports of the group charging anywhere
from .5 to 2 Bitcoins per compromised machine. This varies depending on what the attackers
know about the organization and the assets that they have compromised. The ransom
amount is adjusted based on the likelihood the organization will pay due to impact to their
company or the perceived importance of the target.

Doppelpaymer: Ransomware follows Dridex
Doppelpaymer ransomware recently caused havoc in several highly publicized attacks
against various organizations around the world. Some of these attacks involved large
ransom demands, with attackers asking for millions of dollars in some cases.
Doppelpaymer ransomware, like Wadhrama, Samas, LockerGoga, and Bitpaymer before it,
does not have inherent worm capabilities. Human operators manually spread it within
compromised networks using stolen credentials for privileged accounts along with common
tools like PsExec and Group Policy. They often abuse service accounts, including accounts
used to manage security products, that have domain admin privileges to run native
commands, often stopping antivirus software and other security controls.
The presence of banking Trojans like Dridex on machines compromised by Doppelpaymer
point to the possibility that Dridex (or other malware) is introduced during earlier attack
stages through fake updaters, malicious documents in phishing email, or even by being
delivered via the Emotet botnet.
While Dridex is likely used as initial access for delivering Doppelpaymer on machines in
affected networks, most of the same networks contain artifacts indicating RDP brute force.
This is in addition to numerous indicators of credential theft and the use of reconnaissance
tools. Investigators have in fact found artifacts indicating that affected networks have been
compromised in some manner by various attackers for several months before the
ransomware is deployed, showing that these attacks (and others) are successful and
unresolved in networks where diligence in security controls and monitoring is not applied.
The use of numerous attack methods reflects how attackers freely operate without disruption
– even when available endpoint detection and response (EDR) and endpoint protection
platform (EPP) sensors already detect their activities. In many cases, some machines run

9/20

without standard safeguards, like security updates and cloud-delivered antivirus protection.
There is also the lack of credential hygiene, over-privileged accounts, predictable local
administrator and RDP passwords, and unattended EDR alerts for suspicious activities.

Figure 6. Sample Microsoft Defender ATP alert
The success of attacks relies on whether campaign operators manage to gain control over
domain accounts with elevated privileges after establishing initial access. Attackers utilize
various methods to gain access to privileged accounts, including common credential theft
tools like Mimikatz and LaZagne. Microsoft has also observed the use of the Sysinternals
tool ProcDump to obtain credentials from LSASS process memory. Attackers might also use

10/20

LSASecretsView or a similar tool to access credentials stored in the LSA secrets portion of
the registry. Accessible to local admins, this portion of the registry can reveal credentials for
domain accounts used to run scheduled tasks and services.

Figure 7. Doppelpaymer infection chain
Campaign operators continually steal credentials, progressively gaining higher privileges
until they control a domain administrator-level account. In some cases, operators create new
accounts and grant Remote Desktop privileges to those accounts.
Apart from securing privileged accounts, attackers use other ways of establishing persistent
access to compromised systems. In several cases, affected machines are observed
launching a base64-encoded PowerShell Empire script that connects to a C2 server,
11/20

providing attackers with persistent control over the machines. Limited evidence suggests that
attackers set up WMI persistence mechanisms, possibly during earlier breaches, to launch
PowerShell Empire.
After obtaining adequate credentials, attackers perform extensive reconnaissance of
machines and running software to identify targets for ransomware delivery. They use the
built-in command qwinsta to check for active RDP sessions, run tools that query Active
Directory or LDAP, and ping multiple machines. In some cases, the attackers target highimpact machines, such as machines running systems management software. Attackers also
identify machines that they could use to stay persistent on the networks after deploying
ransomware.
Attackers use various protocols or system frameworks (WMI, WinRM, RDP, and SMB) in
conjunction with PsExec to move laterally and distribute ransomware. Upon reaching a new
device through lateral movement, attackers attempt to stop services that can prevent or stifle
successful ransomware distribution and execution. As in other ransomware campaigns, the
attackers use native commands to stop Exchange Server, SQL Server, and similar services
that can lock certain files and disrupt attempts to encrypt them. They also stop antivirus
software right before dropping the ransomware file itself.
Attempts to bypass antivirus protection and deploy ransomware are particularly successful in
cases where:
Attackers already have domain admin privileges
Tamper protection is off
Cloud-delivered protection is off
Antivirus software is not properly managed or is not in a healthy state
Microsoft Defender ATP generates alerts for many activities associated with these attacks.
However, in many of these cases, affected network segments and their associated alerts are
not actively being monitored or responded to.
Attackers also employ a few other techniques to bypass protections and run ransomware
code. In some cases, we found artifacts indicating that they introduce a legitimate binary and
use Alternate Data Streams to masquerade the execution of the ransomware binary as
legitimate binary.

12/20

Figure 8. Command prompt dump output of the Alternate Data Stream
The Doppelpaymer ransomware binary used in many attacks are signed using what appears
to be stolen certificates from OFFERS CLOUD LTD, which might be trusted by various
security solutions.
Doppelpaymer encrypts various files and displays a ransom note. In observed cases, it uses
a custom extension name for encrypted files using information about the affected
environment. For example, it has used l33tspeak versions of company names and company
phone numbers.
Notably, Doppelpaymer campaigns do not fully infect compromised networks with
ransomware. Only a subset of the machines have the malware binary and a slightly smaller
subset have their files encrypted. The attackers maintain persistence on machines that don’t
13/20

have the ransomware and appear intent to use these machines to come back to networks
that pay the ransom or do not perform a full incident response and recovery.

Ryuk: Human-operated ransomware initiated from Trickbot
infections
Ryuk is another active human-operated ransomware campaign that wreaks havoc on
organizations, from corporate entities to local governments to non-profits by disrupting
businesses and demanding massive ransom. Ryuk originated as a ransomware payload
distributed over email, and but it has since been adopted by human operated ransomware
operators.
Like Doppelpaymer, Ryuk is one of possible eventual payloads delivered by human
operators that enter networks via banking Trojan infections, in this case Trickbot. At the
beginning of a Ryuk infection, an existing Trickbot implant downloads a new payload, often
Cobalt Strike or PowerShell Empire, and begins to move laterally across a network,
activating the Trickbot infection for ransomware deployment. The use of Cobalt Strike
beacon or a PowerShell Empire payload gives operators more maneuverability and options
for lateral movement on a network. Based on our investigation, in some networks, this may
also provide the added benefit to the attackers of blending in with red team activities and
tools.
In our investigations, we found that this activation occurs on Trickbot implants of varying
ages, indicating that the human operators behind Ryuk likely have some sort of list of checkins and targets for deployment of the ransomware. In many cases, however, this activation
phase comes well after the initial Trickbot infection, and the eventual deployment of a
ransomware payload may happen weeks or even months after the initial infection.
In many networks, Trickbot, which can be distributed directly via email or as a second-stage
payload to other Trojans like Emotet, is often considered a low-priority threat, and not
remediated and isolated with the same degree of scrutiny as other, more high-profile
malware. This works in favor of attackers, allowing them to have long-running persistence on
a wide variety of networks. Trickbot, and the Ryuk operators, also take advantage of users
running as local administrators in environments and use these permissions to disable
security tools that would otherwise impede their actions.

14/20

Figure 9. Ryuk infection chain
Once the operators have activated on a network, they utilize their Cobalt Strike or
PowerShell tools to initiate reconnaissance and lateral movement on a network. Their initial
steps are usually to use built-in commands such as net group to enumerate group
membership of high-value groups like domain administrators and enterprise administrators,
and to identify targets for credential theft.
Ryuk operators then use a variety of techniques to steal credentials, including the LaZagne
credential theft tool. The attackers also save various registry hives to extract credentials from
Local Accounts and the LSA Secrets portion of the registry that stores passwords of service
accounts, as well as Scheduled Tasks configured to auto start with a defined account. In
15/20

many cases, services like security and systems management software are configured with
privileged accounts, such as domain administrator; this makes it easy for Ryuk operators to
migrate from an initial desktop to server-class systems and domain controllers. In addition, in
many environments successfully compromised by Ryuk, operators are able to utilize the
built-in administrator account to move laterally, as these passwords are matching and not
randomized.
Once they have performed initial basic reconnaissance and credential theft, the attackers in
some cases utilize the open source security audit tool known as BloodHound to gather
detailed information about the Active Directory environment and probable attack paths. This
data and associated stolen credentials are accessed by the attacker and likely retained, even
after the ransomware portion is ended.
The attackers then continue to move laterally to higher value systems, inspecting and
enumerating files of interest to them as they go, possibly exfiltrating this data. The attackers
then elevate to domain administrator and utilize these permissions to deploy the Ryuk
payload.
The ransomware deployment often occurs weeks or even months after the attackers begin
activity on a network. The Ryuk operators use stolen Domain Admin credentials, often from
an interactive logon session on a domain controller, to distribute the Ryuk payload. They
have been seen doing this via Group Policies, setting a startup item in the SYSVOL share,
or, most commonly in recent attacks, via PsExec sessions emanating from the domain
controller itself.

Improving defenses to stop human-operated ransomware
In human-operated ransomware campaigns, even if the ransom is paid, some attackers
remain active on affected networks with persistence via PowerShell Empire and other
malware on machines that may seem unrelated to ransomware activities. To fully recover
from human-powered ransomware attacks, comprehensive incident response procedures
and subsequent network hardening need to be performed.
As we have learned from the adaptability and resourcefulness of attackers, human-operated
campaigns are intent on circumventing protections and cleverly use what’s available to them
to achieve their goal, motivated by profit. The techniques and methods used by the humanoperated ransomware attacks we discussed in this blog highlight these important lessons in
security:
1. IT pros play an important role in security
Some of the most successful human-operated ransomware campaigns have been against
servers that have antivirus software and other security intentionally disabled, which admins
may do to improve performance. Many of the observed attacks leverage malware and tools

16/20

that are already detected by antivirus. The same servers also often lack firewall protection
and MFA, have weak domain credentials, and use non-randomized local admin passwords.
Oftentimes these protections are not deployed because there is a fear that security controls
will disrupt operations or impact performance. IT pros can help with determining the true
impact of these settings and collaborate with security teams on mitigations.
Attackers are preying on settings and configurations that many IT admins manage and
control. Given the key role they play, IT pros should be part of security teams.
1. Seemingly rare, isolated, or commodity malware alerts can indicate new attacks
unfolding and offer the best chance to prevent larger damage
Human-operated attacks involve a fairly lengthy and complex attack chain before the
ransomware payload is deployed. The earlier steps involve activities like commodity malware
infections and credential theft that Microsoft Defender ATP detects and raises alerts on. If
these alerts are immediately prioritized, security operations teams can better mitigate attacks
and prevent the ransomware payload. Commodity malware infections like Emotet, Dridex,
and Trickbot should be remediated and treated as a potential full compromise of the system,
including any credentials present on it.
1. Truly mitigating modern attacks requires addressing the infrastructure weakness that
let attackers in
Human-operated ransomware groups routinely hit the same targets multiple times. This is
typically due to failure to eliminate persistence mechanisms, which allow the operators to go
back and deploy succeeding rounds of payloads, as targeted organizations focus on working
to resolve the ransomware infections.
Organizations should focus less on resolving alerts in the shortest possible time and more on
investigating the attack surface that allowed the alert to happen. This requires understanding
the entire attack chain, but more importantly, identifying and fixing the weaknesses in the
infrastructure to keep attackers out.
While Wadhrama, Doppelpaymer, Ryuk, Samas, REvil, and other human-operated attacks
require a shift in mindset, the challenges they pose are hardly unique.
Removing the ability of attackers to move laterally from one machine to another in a network
would make the impact of human-operated ransomware attacks less impactful and make the
network more resilient against all kinds of cyberattacks. The top recommendations for
mitigating ransomware and other human-operated campaigns are to practice credential
hygiene and stop unnecessary communication between endpoints.
Here are relevant mitigation actions that enterprises can apply to build better security posture
and be more resistant against cyberattacks in general:

17/20

Harden internet-facing assets and ensure they have the latest security updates. Use
threat and vulnerability management to audit these assets regularly for vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and suspicious activity.
Secure Remote Desktop Gateway using solutions like Azure Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA). If you don’t have an MFA gateway, enable network-level
authentication (NLA).
Practice the principle of least-privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use
of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Enforce strong randomized, just-in-time
local administrator passwords. Use tools like LAPS.
Monitor for brute-force attempts. Check excessive failed authentication attempts
(Windows security event ID 4625).
Monitor for clearing of Event Logs, especially the Security Event log and PowerShell
Operational logs. Microsoft Defender ATP raises the alert “Event log was cleared” and
Windows generates an Event ID 1102 when this occurs.
Turn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security
services.
Determine where highly privileged accounts are logging on and exposing credentials.
Monitor and investigate logon events (event ID 4624) for logon type attributes. Domain
admin accounts and other accounts with high privilege should not be present on
workstations.
Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission on Windows
Defender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to
quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.
Turn on attack surface reduction rules, including rules that block credential theft,
ransomware activity, and suspicious use of PsExec and WMI. To address malicious
activity initiated through weaponized Office documents, use rules that block advanced
macro activity, executable content, process creation, and process injection initiated by
Office applications. To assess the impact of these rules, deploy them in audit mode.
Turn on AMSI for Office VBA if you have Office 365.
Utilize the Windows Defender Firewall and your network firewall to prevent RPC and
SMB communication among endpoints whenever possible. This limits lateral movement
as well as other attack activities.

On endpoints, Microsoft Defender ATP provides unified protection, investigation, and
response capabilities. Durable machine learning and behavior-based protections detect
human-operated campaigns at multiple points in the attack chain, before the ransomware
payload is deployed. These advanced detections raise alerts on the Microsoft Defender
Security Center, enabling security operations teams to immediately respond to attacks using
the rich capabilities in Microsoft Defender ATP.
The Threat and Vulnerability Management capability uses a risk-based approach to the
discovery, prioritization, and remediation of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities on
endpoints. Notably, it allows security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate
seamlessly to remediate issues. For example, through Microsoft Defender ATP’s integration
with Microsoft Intune and System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), security
administrators can create a remediation task in Microsoft Intune with one click.
Microsoft experts have been tracking multiple human operated ransomware groups. To
further help customers, we released a Microsoft Defender ATP Threat Analytics report on the
campaigns and mitigations against the attack. Through Threat Analytics, customers can see
indicators of Wadhrama, Doppelpaymer, Samas, and other campaign activities in their
environments and get details and recommendations that are designed to help security
operations teams to investigate and respond to attacks. The reports also include relevant
advanced hunting queries that can further help security teams look for signs of attacks in
