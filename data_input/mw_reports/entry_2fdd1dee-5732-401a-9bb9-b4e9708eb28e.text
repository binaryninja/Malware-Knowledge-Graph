Summary
Description

This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S
partners, DHS and FBI identified a malware variant used by the North Korean government. This malware has been identified as ELECTRICFISH.
Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA ac
https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.
DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.
This MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use
administrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CIS
Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.
This report provides analysis of one malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be
between a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designa
which allows either side to initiate a tunneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and passwor
allows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system’s required authentication
outside of the network.

Description

This file is a malicious Windows 32-bit executable. The application is a command-line utility and its primary purpose is to tunnel traffic between tw
The application accepts command-line arguments allowing it to be configured with a destination IP address and port, a source IP address and por

reach the destination IP address. A configured proxy server is not required for this utility.
--Begin Example Usage-Source IP/Port: 192.0.2.1:92
Dest IP/Port: 198.51.100.1:92
Proxy IP/Port: 203.0.113.1:92
Proxy User Name: test
Proxy Password: testpw
a12.exe -s 192.0.2.1:92 -d 198.51.100.1:92 -p 203.0.113.1:92 -u test -pw testpw
--End Example Usage-After the malware authenticates with the configured proxy, it will immediately attempt to establish a session with the destination IP address, locate
target network and the source IP address. The header of the initial authentication packet, sent to both the source and destination systems, will be
two random bytes. Everything within this 34-byte header is static except for the bytes 0X2B6E, which will change during each connection attempt.
below (and displayed in Figure 7) is the packet header.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
