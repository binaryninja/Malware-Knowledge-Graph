Weekly TrickBot Analysis - End of w/c 22-Jan-2018 to
1000119
escinsecurity.blogspot.de/2018/01/weekly-trickbot-analysis-end-of-wc-22.html

Here are the results of my analysis of TrickBot Banking Trojan mcconfs shared up to the end
of the week commencing 22nd January 2018. This analysis covers 1,302 unique C2 IP
addresses used in 255 mcconfs across 118 versions, with a highest version of 1000119.
The following graph shows the rate of discovery of TrickBot versions in the wild, based on
shared mcconfs. (Note: The flatter the line, the more frequently versions are discovered.)
Seven versions were discovered in the week commencing 22th January 2018 (A-1000116,
A-1000117, A-1000118, A-1000119, B-1000027, B-1000028, and B-1000029), two the week
before, and four the week before that. Four of the discovered versions extend the original
iteration of version numbers (which I refer to as iteration A), taking this to 1000119. Three
shared versions extend the six repeats from the last two months, where low (1000021 to
1000026) version numbers are reused. (I track these as part of a new, distinct iteration,
iteration B, of the version numbers.)

The following graph shows the number of server entries using ports:
443 (HTTPS);
445 (IBM AS Server Mapper) -- INACTIVE;
449 (Cray Network Semaphore Server); and
451 (SMB) -- INACTIVE.

This week's iteration A configs increased the count of C2 server entries back to a level last
seen at the start of January. The iteration B configs seen continue the low C2 server count
which has typified iteration B.

The following table shows the top 25 servers (of 1,302 unique) used within the 118 versions.
This table changes for the first time in five weeks with the introduction of
94[.]127[.]111[.]14[:]449 into the top 25 due to its use between versions 1000109 and
1000116.

The following table shows the breakdown of detected TrickBot campaign 'gtag' (group tags)
values used in the 255 mcconfs analysed.

97 C2 servers were used in the mcconfs from this week, of which 84 (87%) were new. The
BGP prefix registrations for the C2 server IP addresses continue to be heavily biased to ASN
routed through RU (and so the graph below's Y-axis is cut short to allow clearer viewing of
other country counts). The new servers' IP addresses are associated with ASN routed to:
64xRU, 10xNL, 3xIN, 3xLU, 2xPL, 1xCH, and 1xUS.

The following map shows the geographical location of 85 (scanned by Shodan) of the 97 IP
addresses used in the analysed configs.
Five of these servers are MikroTik devices (historically a favourite of TrickBot), one is an
ER-X and one is a NanoStation Loco M5.
49 are running OpenSSH, 25 are running nginx, 16 are running Apache, eight are
running Exim, eight are running Postfix, four are running MySQL, four are running
ProFTPD, one is running ARK, one is running Dropbear SSH, one is running IIS, one is
running Squid Proxy -- with some servers running as many as four of these products.

The following table shows the BGP allocations of C2 servers' IP addresses to country by
TrickBot version.

Finally, the following table shows the top 25 BGP prefixes used by TrickBot for C2 servers.
