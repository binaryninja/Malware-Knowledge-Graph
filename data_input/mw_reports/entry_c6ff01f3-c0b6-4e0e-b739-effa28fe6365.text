APT Cyber Tools Targeting ICS/SCADA Devices
cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a

Summary
Actions to Take Today to Protect ICS/SCADA Devices:
• Enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access to ICS networks and devices
whenever possible.
• Change all passwords to ICS/SCADA devices and systems on a consistent schedule,
especially all default passwords, to device-unique strong passwords to mitigate password
brute force attacks and to give defender monitoring systems opportunities to detect common
attacks.
• Leverage a properly installed continuous OT monitoring solution to log and alert on
malicious indicators and behaviors.
The Department of Energy (DOE), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn that certain advanced
persistent threat (APT) actors have exhibited the capability to gain full system access to
multiple industrial control system (ICS)/supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
devices, including:
Schneider Electric programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and
Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.
The APT actors have developed custom-made tools for targeting ICS/SCADA devices. The
tools enable them to scan for, compromise, and control affected devices once they have
established initial access to the operational technology (OT) network. Additionally, the actors
can compromise Windows-based engineering workstations, which may be present in
information technology (IT) or OT environments, using an exploit that compromises an
ASRock motherboard driver with known vulnerabilities. By compromising and maintaining full
system access to ICS/SCADA devices, APT actors could elevate privileges, move laterally
within an OT environment, and disrupt critical devices or functions.
DOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI urge critical infrastructure organizations, especially Energy
Sector organizations, to implement the detection and mitigation recommendations provided
in this CSA to detect potential malicious APT activity and harden their ICS/SCADA devices.

Technical Details
1/9

APT actors have developed custom-made tools that, once they have established initial
access in an OT network, enables them to scan for, compromise, and control certain
ICS/SCADA devices, including the following:
Schneider Electric MODICON and MODICON Nano PLCs, including (but may not be
limited to) TM251, TM241, M258, M238, LMC058, and LMC078;
OMRON Sysmac NJ and NX PLCs, including (but may not be limited to) NEX NX1P2,
NX-SL3300, NX-ECC203, NJ501-1300, S8VK, and R88D-1SN10F-ECT; and
OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.
The APT actors’ tools have a modular architecture and enable cyber actors to conduct highly
automated exploits against targeted devices. The tools have a virtual console with a
command interface that mirrors the interface of the targeted ICS/SCADA device. Modules
interact with targeted devices, enabling operations by lower-skilled cyber actors to emulate
higher-skilled actor capabilities.
The APT actors can leverage the modules to scan for targeted devices, conduct
reconnaissance on device details, upload malicious configuration/code to the targeted
device, back up or restore device contents, and modify device parameters.
In addition, the APT actors can use a tool that installs and exploits a known-vulnerable
ASRock-signed motherboard driver, AsrDrv103.sys, exploiting CVE-2020-15368 to
execute malicious code in the Windows kernel. Successful deployment of this tool can allow
APT actors to move laterally within an IT or OT environment and disrupt critical devices or
functions.
APT Tool for Schneider Electric Devices
The APT actors’ tool for Schneider Electric devices has modules that interact via normal
management protocols and Modbus (TCP 502). Modules may allow cyber actors to:
Run a rapid scan that identifies all Schneider PLCs on the local network via User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) multicast with a destination port of 27127 (Note: UDP 27127
is a standard discovery scan used by engineering workstations to discover PLCs and
may not be indicative of malicious activity);
Brute-force Schneider Electric PLC passwords using CODESYS and other available
device protocols via UDP port 1740 against defaults or a dictionary word list (Note: this
capability may work against other CODESYS-based devices depending on individual
design and function, and this report will be updated as more information becomes
available);
Conduct a denial-of-service attack to prevent network communications from reaching
the PLC;
Sever connections, requiring users to re-authenticate to the PLC, likely to facilitate
capture of credentials;

2/9

Conduct a ‘packet of death’ attack to crash the PLC until a power cycle and
configuration recovery is conducted; and
Send custom Modbus commands (Note: this capability may work against Modbus other
than in Schneider Electric PLCs).
Refer to the appendix for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this
tool.
APT Tool for OMRON
The APT actors’ tool for OMRON devices has modules that can interact by:
Scanning for OMRON using Factory Interface Network Service (FINS) protocol;
Parsing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response from OMRON devices;
Retrieving the media access control (MAC) address of the device;
Polling for specific devices connected to the PLC;
Backing up/restoring arbitrary files to/from the PLC; and
Loading a custom malicious agent on OMRON PLCs for additional attacker-directed
capability.
Additionally, the OMRON modules can upload an agent that allows a cyber actor to connect
and initiate commands—such as file manipulation, packet captures, and code execution—via
HTTP and/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).
Refer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.
APT Tool for OPC UA
The APT actors’ tool for OPC UA has modules with basic functionality to identify OPC UA
servers and to connect to an OPC UA server using default or previously compromised
credentials. The client can read the OPC UA structure from the server and potentially write
tag values available via OPC UA.
The threat from this tool can be significantly reduced by properly configuring OPC UA
security. Refer to the Mitigations below for more information.
Refer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.

Mitigations
Note: these mitigations are provided to enable network defenders to begin efforts to protect
systems and devices from new capabilities. They have not been verified against every
environment and should be tested prior to implementing.
DOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI recommend all organizations with ICS/SCADA devices
implement the following proactive mitigations:
3/9

Isolate ICS/SCADA systems and networks from corporate and internet networks using
strong perimeter controls, and limit any communications entering or leaving
ICS/SCADA perimeters.
Enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access to ICS networks and devices
whenever possible.
Have a cyber incident response plan, and exercise it regularly with stakeholders in IT,
cybersecurity, and operations.
Change all passwords to ICS/SCADA devices and systems on a consistent schedule,
especially all default passwords, to device-unique strong passwords to mitigate
password brute force attacks and to give defender monitoring systems opportunities to
detect common attacks.
Ensure OPC UA security is correctly configured with application authentication enabled
and explicit trust lists.
Ensure the OPC UA certificate private keys and user passwords are stored securely.
Maintain known-good offline backups for faster recovery upon a disruptive attack, and
conduct hashing and integrity checks on firmware and controller configuration files to
ensure validity of those backups.
Limit ICS/SCADA systems’ network connections to only specifically allowed
management and engineering workstations.
Robustly protect management systems by configuring Device Guard, Credential Guard,
and Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI). Install Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
solutions on these subnets and ensure strong anti-virus file reputation settings are
configured.
Implement robust log collection and retention from ICS/SCADA systems and
management subnets.
Leverage a continuous OT monitoring solution to alert on malicious indicators and
behaviors, watching internal systems and communications for known hostile actions
and lateral movement. For enhanced network visibility to potentially identify abnormal
traffic, consider using CISA’s open-source Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol
Parsers (ICSNPP).
Ensure all applications are only installed when necessary for operation.
Enforce principle of least privilege. Only use admin accounts when required for tasks,
such as installing software updates.
Investigate symptoms of a denial of service or connection severing, which exhibit as
delays in communications processing, loss of function requiring a reboot, and delayed
actions to operator comments as signs of potential malicious activity.
Monitor systems for loading of unusual drivers, especially for ASRock driver if no
ASRock driver is normally used on the system.
