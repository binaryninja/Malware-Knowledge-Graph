Attackers are actively scanning for exposed Docker APIs on port 2375 and use them to
deploy a malicious payload which drops a Dofloo Trojan variant, a malware known as a
popular tool for building large scale botnets.
The Dofloo (aka AESDDoS) malware was first detected in 2014 [1, 2, 3, 4] and it is known for
allowing hackers to quickly assemble vast numbers of compromised machines used to
create botnets that can launch DDoS attacks and — in the case of some variants — to load
cryptocurrency miners to the infected machines.
Misconfigured Docker services being abused is a known trend given that they have been
under constant attack since early-2018 after coinminer campaigns started spreading to the
cloud following the drop in activity seen by ransomware operations after the end of 2017.

Attacks, infection, and abuse
In the campaign observed by Trend Micro, misconfigured APIs of the Docker EngineCommunity DevOps utility that allow external access to the communication ports are abused
by attackers making it possible to infiltrate misconfigured servers.

"Allowing external access — whether intentionally or by misconfiguration — to API ports
allows attackers to gain ownership of the host, giving them the ability to poison instances
running within it with malware and to gain remote access to users’ servers and hardware
resources," says Trend Micro.

all available containers
The attacks begin with an Internet scan for vulnerable Docker hosts by sending TCP SYN
packets to port 2375 — the Docker daemon communication port which allows for
unencrypted and unauthenticated communication— using an open source SYN/TCP port
scanner, with the bad actors connecting to all live host they found and asking for running
containers.
The Dofloo botnet malware is subsequently "deployed using the docker exec command" to
all discovered containers says Trend Micro's research, executing the malware that will
enable the "attackers to launch several types of DDoS attacks, such as SYN, LSYN, UDP,
UDPS, and TCP flood."
System information is also collected by the Trojan after execution, with the data being
packed and sent to its command-and-control (C&C) server allowing its masters to decide
what the next course of action will be depending on the hardware configuration of the
compromised machine.

Trend Micro's research team provides a list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) containing
hashes of malware samples used during these attacks at the end of the report.

Previous Dofloo and Docker attacks
Dofloo was previously detected while being dropped by a malicious campaign that exploited
a critical server-side template injection Atlassian Confluence Server and Data
Center vulnerability to compromise Linux and Windows servers in late April.
Exposed Docker APIs were abused by other malicious campaigns, with one being detected
in March by Imperva while exploiting the CVE-2019-5736 runc vulnerability disclosed one
month earlier allowing attackers to overwrite the host runc binary and gain root-level code
execution privileges.
Cryptojacking operations have also actively targeted misconfigured Docker services in
November 2018 as unearthed by Juniper Networks researchers, with cybercriminals adding
their own containers which executed Monero mining scripts.
Further back, in October 2018 and March 2018, other campaigns have also been observed
while scanning the Internet for easy to infiltrate Docker hosts and deploy containers that
would download and execute coin miners.

Securing Docker servers
While Docker Engine API abuse is not something new, it keeps being an issue because
administrators do not know how to properly secure their systems.
To make sure that their Docker hosts are secured against this types of attacks, admins
should be using adequate security controls that allow only trusted sources to access the
Docker API as explained in the Securing Docker remote daemon chapter available on the
Docker documentation website.
