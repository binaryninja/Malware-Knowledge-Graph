The Jamf Threat Labs team has recently identified changes to the UpdateAgent malware
dropper. These changes primarily focus on new executables written in Swift that reach out to
a registration server to pull down a new set of instructions in the form of a bash script.
Perhaps one of the most identifiable features of the malware is that it relies on the AWS
infrastructure to host its various payloads and perform its infection status updates to the
server. The continued development of this malware shows that its authors continue to remain
active, trying to reach as many users as possible.

Dropper and Initial Instructions
The newly discovered Swift-based dropper exhibits many of the characteristics of typical
dropper malware, including some minor system fingerprinting, endpoint registration and
persistence. The second stage download and execute the functionality of droppers, in
general, represent a risky class of malware that support a number of second-stage attacks
— from malware to spyware, to adware.

In this case, Jamf Threat Labs was tipped by an increase in adware/malware threat
preventions that appeared to be a part of the same family. Additionally, each instance was
traced to an executable named PDFCreator. This executable was unsigned and running from
the “/Library/Application Support” directory. Upon further inspection, the executable was
determined to be written in Swift, containing suspiciously obfuscated (base64) strings.
At the time of discovery, this binary had zero hits from antivirus vendors in VirusTotal.

When executed, this binary is responsible for reaching out to a registration server and setting
up persistence on the system on which it runs.
When this executable runs, the following command is run to gather the machine hardware id
in order to use it as a unique identifier moving forward.
The executable then uses the following curl command to reach out to a server to register the
device and acquire a bash script to be executed.
The execution of this bash script is the mach-O executable’s primary task. After pulling it
from the URL, it runs directly from the Swift dropper without hitting the hard drive. During our
analysis, the script contents were uploaded to VirusTotal and can be seen here.

Based on the results we are seeing, we suspect this bash script is likely built dynamically as
machines are registered. This script performs a large number of actions. Below are just
some of the interesting variables that are used which we’ve labeled with comments.
Additionally, another variable titled “URL” was set. However, it was obvious that at the time of
investigation the link meant to provide this URL value was currently down or unattainable as
the $URL variable was set to a “File not found” type error.
However, other samples of this malicious script can be found on VT that appear to have
URLs pointing to AWS S3 buckets. AWS has been made aware of the specifics.

Dropped Malware
When the URL variable is accurately set by the server, it gets used to download a stage-2
disk image (DMG) to the endpoint. Below, we’ve again commented on the code to describe
what's happening.
In cases where the $URL is active, the downloaded DMG contained an application. The
application file name held within the DMG appears to have been created by combining a few
random words together. This application is then copied to the /tmp directory. A handful of the
ones we’ve seen are as follows:
The path to the newly created application is then stored within the $TMPFILE variable
created earlier.
One interesting trick that this malware uses is that it modifies the /etc/sudoers file with the
following command:
This command makes it so that the basic user can execute the script ($TMPFILE) as root
without requiring a password. This modification to the sudoers file is only possible if
UpdateAgent is already running as root.
The malware then creates a user-level LaunchAgent by running a series of PlistBuddy
commands. Here’s an example of a resulting launch agent:
Both the editing of the sudoers file and the creation of persistence using the PlistBuddy
command align with past workflows done by UpdateAgent according to previous findings
from Microsoft.
When this plist loads at runtime, it will execute the temporary application. Even though it runs
as a user LaunchAgent it is able to escalate to root without a password due to the previously
mentioned modification made to the /etc/sudoers file.

3/5

After the LaunchAgent is loaded, the malicious bash script sleeps for a short period of time
and then performs cleanup by unmounting the DMG file and removing the changes it made
to the sudoers file.

Other Executables
In many circumstances, we see yet another plist and binary combination being dropped by
PDFCreator called“ActiveDirectory”.

Once again, in the VirusTotal screenshot above, this binary is seen as clean.
After close examination, we noted that this executable is almost identical to the PDFCreator
executable. The primary difference is that it reaches out to a different URL from which it
should load a bash script.
In the cases that we observed, this downloaded bash script would send a simple check-in
event to the cloud. If the contents of this URL change, the victim computer can perform any
given instructions when it checks in next.

Conclusion
The authors of the UpdateAgent malware remain vigilant in keeping it up to date. It is known
for having a well-built backend that allows itself to be easily updated, and although we’ve
only seen adware families dropped by it, security experts are concerned that there might be
other malicious plans for the future with such a well-built infrastructure.
Jamf Protect users are covered against the known, existing families of this malware,
including various different detection surrounding suspicious behaviors and potentially
unwanted applications, thanks to the frequently updated behavioral analytics.

4/5

Threat actors and malware authors are savvy to updating their toolsets to
continue compromising endpoints.
So, why not rely on a solution, like Jamf Protect, that is consistently updated and has the
strength of the Jamf Threat Labs behind it to prevent the latest threats?
