Trends in the Recent Emotet Maldoc Outbreak
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/Trends-in-the-recent-emotet-maldoc-outbreak
April 18, 2022

Emotet is a malware family that steals sensitive and private information from victims'
computers. The malware has infected more than a million devices and is considered one of
the most dangerous threats of the decade.
In addition to analyzing threats, FortiGuard Labs also focuses on how malware spreads. We
have observed that the recent Emotet outbreak is being spread through a variety of
malicious Microsoft Office files, or maldocs, attached to phishing emails. Once a victim opens
the attached document, a VBA Macro or Excel 4.0 Macro is used to execute malicious code
that downloads and runs the Emotet malware.
In this blog, we will focus on what these malicious documents look like and how they drop
Emotet malware onto a victim's local disk. We will first look at the samples captured in this
campaign and then examine their propagation trends.

Affected Platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users
Impact: Controls victim's device and collects sensitive information
Severity Level: Critical

Phishing Emails with Malicious Attachment
The recent Emotet outbreak uses phishing emails combined with social engineering to trick
victims into loading the malware onto their devices. These emails often include "Re:" or "Fw:"
in the subject line, as shown in Figure 1 and 2, to disguise the email as a reply or forwarded
message to help convince the target that the email is legitimate.

Figure 3 showcases another technique, where the malicious document is packed into a ZIP
archive with a password that is attached to an email, with the password included in the body
of the text.

Examining the Malicious Excel Files and Word Documents
The attached Excel files and Word documents contain malicious macros. Once opened, they
display an image requesting the victim to click the "Enable Content" button in the security
warning bar. This enables the malicious macro to be executed.
The images below show the techniques used to trick victims into clicking the "Enable
Content" button in the Excel files and Word documents used in this campaign. Figure 4
shows screenshots of an opened Word document and Figure 5 is of the opened Excel file.

Analyzing the Malicious Macros and their Behaviors
Macros in Microsoft Office files are usually written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). In
this case, the Word documents contain malicious VBA code while the Excel files use Excel
4.0 Macro in addition to VBA Macro.
We captured five different samples connected with this Emotet campaign that contain
differences in the macro code and execution flow. For identification purposes, we have given
each sample a tag name, which is from when the sample first appeared. The tag name
2/8

consists of two parts, the year prefix and a suffix with the week of the month, connected by
an underscore.
The first sample appeared in the third week of November 2021 and its tag name is
"2021_NovW3". It is an Excel file or Word document with VBA Macro. The second is an
Excel file using Excel 4.0 Macro. It appeared in the fourth week of November 2021 with the
tag name "2021_NovW4". The third sample is a Word document with a VBA Macro with the
tag name of "2021_DecW2". The fourth sample is an Excel file with an Excel 4.0 Macro. Itâ€™s
tag name is "2021_DecW4". The fifth sample is an Excel file with a VBA Macro and the tag
name of "2022_FebW2".

Below is an analysis of the malicious macro component of each captured sample.

2021_NovW3:
This sample has a VBA function called "Workbook_Open()" or "Document_Open()" that is
executed automatically when the file is opened. It then calls another function to write script
data to a VBS file and save it in the "C:\ProgramData\" folder. Next, it uses "Wscript.exe" to
execute the VBS file.

In the VBS file it generates a PowerShell code snippet to download the Emotet malware dll
into the "C:\ProgramData\" folder and then execute it using "regsvr32.exe".

2021_NovW4:

3/8

This is an Excel file that uses formulas on an Excel 4.0 Macro sheet instead of a VBA Macro
to execute malicious code. As shown in Figure 8, some sheets are hidden, including the one
that contains the malicious formulas. Cell A1 in sheet "FEGFL" is named "Auto_Open" and
includes a built-in macro that automatically runs the formula from that cell once the file is
opened.
This macro sheet includes formulas that call the API "URLDownloadToFileA" to download the
Emotet malware from different URLs. It attempts to download the Emotet malware from the
URL in each formula until a download is successful. The Emotet malware is a dll file saved
with an .ocx file extension and executed using "regsvr32.exe".
Figure 8: The Macro Sheet is hidden and cell A1 is named "Auto_Open"

2021_DecW2:
This VBA code includes a function called "AutoOpen()" that automatically runs a macro when
the document is opened. In this function, it saves itself as an HTA (HTML Application) file in
text format, as shown in Figure 9. At the same time, script data is displayed in the content
text area below the picture that is hidden with a minimum font size and white font color (the
font color has been changed to red in Figure 9 for easier viewing). Since the HTA file is in
text format, the script data in the content text area is the only part included in the file. To
execute the HTA file, "explorer.exe" on Windows system is used in the VBA Macro.
Figure 9: VBA code to save ActiveDocument as HTA file
Figure 10: VBA code to execute the dropped HTA file
Script code in the HTA file extracts JavaScript code to download the Emotet malware. The
Emotet malware is saved to the "C:\Users\Public" folder as a JPG file, but it is actually a dll
file. In the end, the Emotet malware dll is executed with "rundll32.exe".
Figure 11: Script code in the HTA file

2021_DecW4:
In the hidden macro sheet "Macro1", cell F1 is named "Auto_Open" to automatically run the
formula when the file is opened. There is normal text in the cells below cell F1 until cell F18,
which contains the formula to execute. The simple formula, shown in Figure 12, uses
"mshta.exe" to execute an HTML URL. The web page of HTML URL is protected by HTML
Guardian, a tool that encrypts source code.
Figure 12: Formula and "Auto_Open" in macro sheet
After decrypting the HTML source code, there is a VBScript code snippet obfuscated by the
string "{GOOGLE}", as shown in Figure 13. It runs a PowerShell code snippet to download
and execute script from a PNG URL. The PNG URL is not an image file but a PowerShell
4/8

script file that contains multiple URLs to download Emotet malware. Finally, the Emotet
malware is saved as a dll file in the "C:\Users\Public\Documents\" folder and executed using
"rundll32.exe".

2022_FebW2:
This sample has the same code and execution flow as "2021_DecW4". But instead of using
an Excel 4.0 Macro, it uses a VBA Macro to execute its malicious behaviors. Figure 14
shows the content in the autorun function "AutoOpen()". Although there are lots of
comments, the VBA code is very simple, using "mshta.exe" to execute an HTML URL. As the
script code and subsequent process in the HTML URL is identical to the contents in
"2021_DecW4", we can look at it for more details.

Attack Trends in the Latest Emotet Campaign
Emotet was first discovered in 2014 and continues to attack victims. The latest Emotet
campaign broke out in mid-November of 2021 and is spread using malicious documents
attached to phishing emails. FortiGuard Labs has been tracking these malicious documents
as well as the number of variants used to evade detection in this campaign. Figure 15 shows
the daily timestamps for Emotet maldocs used from mid-November 2021 to March 2022. All
the samples mentioned in the previous section emerged during this period.
The first attack appeared on November 16, 2021. After that, it spread different types of
malicious documents every week until the Christmas break. Once the break ended on
January 12, it surged with more frequent and consistent attacks, releasing a large number
and variety of malicious documents. From the end of February through the end of March, it
turned to using the same type of malicious document (2021_NovW4) with different phishing
picture templates. After February 28th, new malicious documents appeared every day except
for weekends, with only one or two days off.

Conclusion
In the previous section, we showed that some types of malicious documents have more
timestamps on the timeline than others. The pie chart in Figure 16 is based on the
occurrence frequency of timestamps, showing the usage rate of each malicious document in
this campaign. According to this chart, "2021_NovW4" has been the most active, involving
more than 50% of the malicious documents discovered. The second most is "2021_NovW3",
consisting of 27% Excel files and 6% Word documents. It is worth mentioning that Excel files

5/8

accounted for 93% of all malicious documents, much higher than Word documents at only
7%. One of the possible reasons is that the Excel 4.0 Macro only works with Excel files.
Because if this, users should be especially cautious about suspicious emails with an
attached Excel file from an unknown sender.

FortiGuard Labs also collected the Emotet malware payloads during this period. Figure 17
shows the weekly counts of Emotet malware, with timestamps for each Emotet maldoc in the
timeline displayed below the bar chart. Weeks with high counts match when malicious
documents appeared, while those without malicious documents were almost silent.
Figure 17: Count of Emotet malware per week
The graph also shows that all malicious documents detected after Christmas were Excel
files. Using an Excel file is more flexible because its macro type can be VBA Macro, Excel
4.0 Macro, or both. One of the benefits is that Excel 4.0 Macro, an older technique, bypasses
antivirus detection more easily than a VBA Macro.
As shown in the timeline, Emotet malware has primarily been spread since March 2022
through the malicious Excel file "2021_NovW4", which uses the Excel 4.0 Macro. We believe
that the authors prefer to use Excel files with Excel 4.0 Macro for malicious documents to
reduce detection by antivirus engines.
