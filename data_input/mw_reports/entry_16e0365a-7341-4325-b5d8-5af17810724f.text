Introduction
Last week FireEye shared that they experienced unauthorized access and theft of their offensive
security tools used by their red team, by a sophisticated state-sponsored adversary. Although the theft of these
sophisticated tools will have an impact on future attacks carried out by the adversary, how they accessed the tools
was a much bigger problem. Over the weekend FireEye shared more details of their compromise and broke the
news that they fell victim to a supply-chain attack involving the IT services company SolarWinds. FireEye reported
the SolarWinds Orion software update had a backdoor injected into its code, which SolarWinds believed to have
been included in updates released between March and June 2020. It should be noted, however, that some
researchers have reported seeing activity as early as late 2019. The backdoor was dubbed SUNBURST by
FireEye.

This supply-chain attack still has an unknown impact. According to SolarWinds’ website their
customers include many U.S. Government agencies, as well as a significant percentage of the Fortune
500. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) it is estimated that at
least 18,000 installed the malicious update.
Due to the nature of the attack, including the supply-chain compromise, the actor’s extreme attention to detail and
operational security, as well as the high-profile targets who were successfully compromised as a result of the
attack, it is suspected that it was conducted by a nation-state sponsored
group. Volexity researchers have attributed this attack to a threat actor under the name of Dark Halo, whom they
have been tracking since late 2019.
SUNBURST, the implant delivered via the backdoored SolarWinds Orion update, was found in one of the DLL files
contained in the update, specifically “SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll”. According to FireEye, the
backdoor has a dormant period of up to two weeks, and then will attempt to resolve a subdomain
of avsvmcloud[.]com, which will return a DNS CNAME record pointing to a command and control (C2) domain. We
go into detail on the functionality of SUNBURST in our Cyborg Labs Threat Hunt Deep Dive, in which we review
the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise, and examine the SUNBURST implant and how it behaves in an
environment.

UPDATE: 17 December 2020
We are releasing 3 threat detection packages that will allow organizations to detect SUNBURST activity in their
environment.

Cyborg Security’s research and development team has built dozens of threat detection packages for the
SUNBURST implant and additional malicious behaviours described by FireEye. These packages come tailored to
your unique environment and can be immediately downloaded and deployed.
You can find these detections, in addition to all known indicators of compromise (IOC), on the HUNTER platform.
