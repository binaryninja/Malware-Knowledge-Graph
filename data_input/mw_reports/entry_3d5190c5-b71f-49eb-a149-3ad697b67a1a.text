Overview
OceanLotus is an APT Group with alleged Vietnamese background. The group was ﬁrst
revealed and named by SkyEye Team in May 2015. Its attack activities can be traced
back to April 2012. The targets include China's maritime institutions, maritime
construction, scientiﬁc research institutes and shipping enterprises.

In fact, according to reports of various security vendors, OceanLotus also attacked
several countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, even some victims in Vietnam,
like opinion leaders, media, real estate companies, foreign enterprises and banks.

RedDrip Team (formerly SkyEye Team) has been to OceanLotus to keep track of high
strength, groupactivity, found it in the near future to Indochinese Peninsula countries
since 2019 the latest attack activity used in the initial launch load ﬁles and attack using
the technology, and combined with the QiAnXin threat intelligence data, associated with
a series of attacks.
In this report, we share our summary of the latest attack techniques, attack payloads and
related attacks of the OceanLotus, hoping that we can jointly improve understanding of
OceanLotus group, an extremely active APT group.

Attacks on Countries
The following is a list of typical cases of attacks against some countries on Indochinese
Peninsula since the end of 2018. For other unmentioned samples, please refer to the
IOC list at the end of this report.

Vietnam
Bait Compression Files
On April 1, 2019, RedDrip discovered a Vietnamese ﬁle name "Hop dong sungroup.rar"
in the process of daily monitoring the attack activities of the OceanLotus.
The English version is "Sun Group contract". The compressed package contains
winword.exe which is renamed as “Noi dung chi tiet hop dong sungroup can chinh sua”.

In addition, we are also associated with another package decoy
SUN_GROUP_CORPORATION that translates as "Sun Group Corporation". The ﬁle
name in the zip package is as follows:
Noi dung can xac thuc va sua GUI den CONG TY CO PHAN TAP DOAN MAT TROI Bo
Tai chinh. exe

It turned out that Sun City Group was actually one of the largest real estate developers
in Vietnam.

Both samples were uploaded by Vietnam. Therefore, we speculate that the OceanLotus
Group in the Sun City internal staff ﬁshing attacks.
In addition to targeting the Vietnamese real estate industry, we also found that the group
would conduct phishing attacks against the national bank of Vietnam:
The compressed package of the related samples is called cplh-nhnn-01-209.rar. The
corresponding date of the samples is January 22, 2019, and the attack is most likely to
occur in a similar period.

The Chinese name of the compressed package is: "national bank of Vietnam -- 01209.rar";The winword. Exe in the package was renamed "chiphilienhoannhnnbc209.exe", which translated as "state bank of Vietnam sbv-bc 209.exe".
SBV refers to Vietnam's central bank, the state bank of Vietnam (SBV), while BC actually
refers to B2C, or third-party payment.

This attack is likely to be launched against the bank's internal staff, similar to the
document transmission process disguised as a third-party payment within the bank.
In addition, there are anti-virus software related information through the disguise of
ﬁshing.

Compressed package name: "Gui lai cho MS.MAI post content kaspersky. Rar" (return
MS.MAI post content kaspersky)

We also see oil as a theme for ﬁshing:
"Tinh dau can mua" (essential oil required), the PE ﬁle in the package is called "details
about purchase and purchase"

Bait Documents
The above compression package contains the Kaspersky name bait, and there is also a
similar name "Content marketing kaspersky.doc" in the bait document. After opening the
document, it will be shown as follows, enabling the macro attack method for the
Vietnamese version of the induced click.

In addition, we also found a large number of OceanLotus disguised as a resume attack
ﬁshing activities, we internally named it OceanCV activity, and this activity will directly
OceanLotus commonly used three macro attack means all exposure.
First of all, we analyze the sample names. It can be seen that the sample names all start
with CV and have the characteristics of naming. There are three main types:
1, CV- name (e.g., cv-nguyenquynhchi.docx)
2. CV- name - position (e.g. CV-AnthonyWei- customerservice. docx)
3. CV- random number + English (e.g. Cv-103237-ewqdsd.doc)
It is worth noting that some samples will show the identity indicating the need to enable
macro after opening:

However, when you pull down the progress bar, you will ﬁnd resumes written in
Vietnamese, which is true for most of the samples in the series of activities, and the
resumes are inconsistent.

And these sample phishing resumes use different methods.Some use the OceanLotus
MSO macro (RedDrip internally named MSOMacro)

Some use template injection techniques:

奇安信威胁情报中心

Some use the technique of converting macro code to a 1-pound font hidden in a
document (later upgraded to a white 1-pound font, internally named OHNMacro for
RedDrip).

In the following sections we will examine each of these three macro usage analyses in
detail.
According to this batch of resume samples, we conducted homologous sample
correlation for these three macro documents, combined with various dimensions, and
ﬁnally found a large number of exclusive malicious macro samples of OceanLotus.
Please refer to the relevant section of Ofﬁce samples for details.

Exploit Vulnerabilities of Eternal Blue
We also found that OceanLotus used the "Eternal blue" series of vulnerabilities to target
companies in Vietnam that provided software to the government.
Website: https://www.tandan.com.vn/portal/home/default.aspx
TAN DAN JSC for Vietnam's software company.

The company will provide the government with mail servers, ofﬁcial gazette
database systems, citizenship management systems and more.

After the attack is successful, it will distribute Trojan horses. In the report "suspected" of
"OceanLotus" organization's early attack activities against domestic colleges and
universities "compiled by us last year, the Trojan horses used eternal blue to attack
colleges and universities are consistent.

In addition to traditional malicious payloads that take advantage of black and white
mechanisms, malicious payloads that inﬁltrate tweets and websites, OceanLotus also
takes advantage of the latest Winrar vulnerability to launch attacks against Vietnam.Here
is one of the cases we captured:
The package name is "tut_photoshop_scan_bank_id.rar"

From the sample trigger vulnerability extract ﬁle, its name is called CocCocUpated. Exe

COCCOC is a Vietnam was founded in 2013 as a new technology company, provides
online Internet search engine services and browsers, the main language used in
Vietnamese and English, the search service is Vietnam's most mature, browser is based
on Google Chromium development, support Windows, iOS platform.

Through analysis, we found that it was the early Trojan framework of OceanLotus, and
we also put it in the section of sample analysis for separate analysis.
Bait, of course, in addition to the above, we also found that the OceanLotus will use
compressed package embedded MP4 way exploit, compressed package name
translated roughly "Cho exclusive blockbuster movie" Ray hospital, including Cho Ray
refers to ho chi minh city, Vietnam water wok hospital (ChợRẫy), ho chi minh city,
Vietnam's largest general hospital.

The package contains two MP4 ﬁles, one of which is identical to the package name, and
a video translated as "the team began stafﬁng after the exclusive stroke press release.

Similarly, released for coccocupdate.exe

And its distribute means is the way that USES network dish to undertake putting
however.

This new Trojan horse will be analyzed in detail in the section of sample analysis.

MAC Backdoor
In addition to targeting Vietnam on the Windows platform, OceanLotus also attacks
Vietnamese users on the MacOS platform. The following samples are typical of recent
launches, which use such means as browser update, Flash installation update package,
font installation package, disguised as a document to actually attack the installer.

Interestingly, when we were analyzing the samples disguised as Firefox, it would show
the interface of installing Firefox after opening. Double-click the icon of Firefox, and the
Trojan horse would be executed:

When you click on the update, even if you are disconnected from the Internet, the
download progress bar will appear.

This is the fake interface the attacker drew:

Similarly, in the following chapters, this batch of MacOS samples targeted at Vietnam
were extended for analysis.

Cambodia
Here is this year's latest attack on Cambodia by OceanLotus, called "report-no.0162(02
Pages).doc."

It is named Form_Provisional Agenda of the ASEAN Senior Ofﬁcials Preparatory
Meeting.
Actually, the meeting was successfully held in Thailand on April 6, 2019. From the
creation time and upload time of the document (2019-03-22), it can be seen that
OceanLotus has a strong ability to obtain current affairs and a long preparatory cycle.

The second document, Program Retreat, may target the military, but the broader
meaning of the name does not make the attacker's heart sink.
Besides, the document contents of the two ﬁles in the above table are the same. The
following is the screenshot after restoring the shellcode font in the document:

It also USES OHN macros.

Sample Analysis
MSO Macro Documents
The "MSO macro" of OceanLotus has commonality. We analyzed one sample, and it can
be seen that the extracted macro code is as follows:
First it adds the Data through the Data variable, and then after base64 decryption,
decrypts the VBS code, releases it into the msohtml.log, and copies wscript. Exe into
Windows \SysWOW64\msohtml.exe:

Execute the msohtml.log script by copying msohtml.exe (that is, wcript.exe), as shown in
the ﬁgure below:

And create scheduled tasks:

The contents of the msohtml.log script are as follows. It will execute the data in the cs
array after xor 518:

The decrypted script, as shown in the ﬁgure, will execute the malicious code after the
elements in the cs array xor 415:

OHN Macro Documents
Extract the macro code from the sample, open the word document, it will prompt to
enable the macro, after enabling the macro will execute this function:

Then it will copy its ofﬁce document to temp and name it random, as shown in the ﬁgure:

Then modify the security of the registry macro:

Take the data in the last ﬁve paragraphs of the total number of paragraphs (5
paragraphs in total, 2 blank lines, 3 with hex data), convert it from hex to bin, add it to
the macro code of the new ﬁle, and then set the x_N0th1ngH3r3 method to execute the
macro code after 1 second:

This is the way that shellcode is loaded with three macros, mostly to combat shellcode
static killing.

Template Injection Documents
The template injection class document of OceanLotus has universality, after the
document starts, it will load XXX.XXX/XXX. PNG
And do the following.

To give an example of one of these attacks, fdsw.png is an ofﬁce compound document:
(d497bd06b34a046841bb63d3bf20e605)

If SysWOW64\cmd.exe ﬁle exists, the system is either 32-bit or 64-bit.

Depending on the system, the ﬁle is taken out of the cell, base64 decoded, and dropped
to: %appdata% main_background-png:

The hijacked csids are "{2dea658f-54c1-4227-af9b-260ab5fc3543}".

According to this CSID, it is the CSID of the DLL that is hijacked:
%SystemRoot%\System32\ playsndsrv.dll

This DLL is used to play sound.
The extraction content of base64 content in the cell is as follows:

Base64 decodes one of the 32-bit PE, Dllmain will apply 0x34aca byte memory space,
and then write the shellcode at 0x10012760 into memory, and execute it through the
thread:

Shellcode goes to the pointer at offset 0xfc8 when the parameter is passed to the
function of sub_160018:

According to the table comparison, the command line of the ﬁrst sample is different from
other samples. It can be known that it should be the sample of different attacks. This
sample is the annotated version, which will load shellcode in memory in the same way.

The PE included in the ﬁle is found in a hacker's toolkit. The ﬁle name is CMD [w7][x64].
The function of this sample is to execute the McOds. Exe (this is the exe ﬁle name of the
white utility program used by OceanLotus) through the CMD [w7][x64]. Exe contained in
the ﬁle, while the McOds. Exe should be the ﬁle released by the dropper before.

The upload place of this sample is VN, the upload time is July 31, and the ﬁle name is

Through the analysis and comparison of these samples, we can know that these
samples should be used to speciﬁcally execute exe ﬁle in memory, and pass command
line parameters of the Loader program, is the last six months to use the new malicious
code framework, speciﬁcally used to develop against static kill.
It is found that two samples are 10M, and the end is ﬁlled with 0x20 (space), which is
ﬁlled into a large ﬁle to avoid being uploaded:

And the way shellcode is loaded for these samples is a little different:
1. Most samples are executed shellcode by creating threads

2, compile the earliest version of the sample, in the form of services, with comments, in
serviceMain create thread execution shellcode

3. A small part of samples execute shellcode directly on the main thread

If it is encrypted by the original Dropper, it will read the randomly generated 128-bit key
from the "DB99050C" environment variable, decrypt the code at 0x40e000, and then
decrypt one more layer and decompress one more layer, because the code has one
layer of encryption and compression in the original Dropper:

A comparison between this version of Dropper and the 2015 version of Dropper:
1. The Dropper in 2015 is to pass the randomly generated decryption key through the
command line parameter, while the Dropper in this version is to pass the key through the
environment variables between the process chains (API is SetEnvironmentVariableW
and GetEnvironmentVariableW).
2, the presence of the 2015 version of the detection virtual machine, this version does
not exist in the detection virtual machine.

Many of the internal strings are encrypted. The following is where the encryption function
is used:

The message distribution function of remote control is as follows: different operations will
be performed according to its own token in the ﬁrst place. The following is the operation

The key used for data transmission is different from the key used for decryption string.
The following is the encryption key for data transmission:

It is worth noting that some of the recent Mac samples of hibiscus were found to have
signatures. After deduplication, we found two commonly used ones:
Melinda Cline (P74QRJXB2F)

Ofﬁce Documents
Through correlation analysis, it is found that the macro document sample and a large
number of samples have the same origin.
As can be seen from the comparison case below, the content of the document was
created at the same time and by the same author.

After analyzing the bait names of these samples, each has its own characteristics
1, the name has political characteristics: arrested activists list

Include resume trolls

3. There are some documents showing the startup of the induction macro, which are
inconsistent with the previous induction interface.

In addition, historical samples are also different from the latest sample technology. As
shown below, some historical samples do not use template injection technology, but use
direct macro code execution method, and the code to be executed is shown in the
document content, namely the OHN macro code mentioned in the section of sample
analysis.

After correlation analysis of the macro samples mentioned above, it can be found
that the earliest such attack was in 2017. The bait document uploaded by Vietnam
was a test sample with a high probability from the ﬁle name.
SAMPLES 08 _11__12_2017 (317).

Compression Files
In the process of analyzing a Thu moi 209.rar sample of OceanLotus, we found that the
generation time of the sample was suspected to be a custom suspect

As seen from the upload time of the sample, the upload time to VT is March 1, 2019, and
the time difference in the compressed package is too large.

Therefore, after correlation capture of this time, we found multiple correlation samples of
OceanLotus.

Therefore, it can be further conﬁrmed that the OceanLotus group will customize the
sample generation time, and batch generation of samples for delivery.

This report covers a large number of attacks on Indochinese Peninsula countries and the
resources used by the OceanLotus Group, revealing its endless history of attacks,
extremely wide range of targets and very creative technical means. In attacks, the group
was always changing baits, payloads, AV evasion techniques, even domain names
assets are constantly evolving, reﬂects a very strong ability to ﬁght and attack will.
Therefore, when we are tracking the attack activities of OceanLotus against China, we
extend our understanding of the TTP of this notorious group. This process will never
end.
