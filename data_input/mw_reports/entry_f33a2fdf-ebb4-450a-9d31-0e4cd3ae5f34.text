LookBack Malware Targets the United States Utilities Sector with Phishing Attacks Impersonating Engineering Licensing
Boards

2/8

August 01, 2019 Michael Raggi and Dennis Schwarz with the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team
Overview
Between July 19 and July 25, 2019, several spear phishing emails were identified targeting three US companies in the
utilities sector. The phishing emails appeared to impersonate a US-based engineering licensing board with emails
originating from what appears to be an actor-controlled domain, nceess[.]com. Nceess[.]com is believed to be an
impersonation of a domain owned by the US National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. The emails
contain a malicious Microsoft Word attachment that uses macros to install and run malware that Proofpoint researchers
have dubbed “LookBack.” This malware consists of a remote access Trojan (RAT) module and a proxy mechanism used
for command and control (C&C) communication. We believe this may be the work of a state-sponsored APT actor based
on overlaps with historical campaigns and macros utilized. The utilization of this distinct delivery methodology coupled
with unique LookBack malware highlights the continuing threats posed by sophisticated adversaries to utilities systems
and critical infrastructure providers.
Delivery
Emails delivered on July 19 and July 25 purported to be a failed examination result from the NCEES (National Council of
Examiners for Engineering and Surveying) and fraudulently utilized the NCEES logo. The email sender address and
reply-to fields contained the impersonation domain nceess[.]com. Like the phishing domain, the email bodies
impersonated member ID numbers and the signature block of a fictitious employee at NCEES. The Microsoft Word
document attachment included in the email also invoked the failed examination pretense with the file name “Result
Notice.doc.”

All emails originated from the IP address 79.141.168[.]137, which appears to be an actor-controlled IP utilized to host the
phishing domain nceess[.]com. An examination of passive DNS and domain registration history for this domain identified
additional domains that appeared to be actor registered, which also impersonated engineering and electric licensing
bodies in the US. Among these domains, only nceess[.]com was observed in active phishing campaigns targeting utility
companies.
Exploitation
The phishing messages were found to contain a Microsoft Word document attachment that uses VBA macros to
install LookBack malware. When the attachment is executed, the malicious VBA macro within the Microsoft Word
attachment drops three Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files to the host: tempgup.txt, tempgup2.txt, and tempsodom.txt.
Additionally, the file Temptcm.tmp, which is a version of certutil.exe, is dropped to decode the PEM files
using Temptcm.tmp. The macro next creates a copy of the decoded PEM files restoring their proper file extensions with
the Windows essentuti.exe. tempgup.txt becomes GUP.exe, which impersonates the name of an open-source binary
used by Notepad++; tempgup2.txt becomes libcurl.dll, a malicious loader DLL file; and tempsodom.txt
becomes sodom.txt, which contains command and control configuration data utilized by the malware. Finally, the macro
launches GUP.exe and the libcurl.dll loader separately, resulting in the execution of LookBack malware.
LookBack Malware
LookBack malware is a remote access Trojan written in C++ that relies on a proxy communication tool to relay data from
the infected host to a command and control IP. Its capabilities include an enumeration of services; viewing of process,
system, and file data; deleting files; executing commands; taking screenshots; moving and clicking the mouse; rebooting
the machine and deleting itself from an infected host. The malware consists of the following components:
A command and control proxy tool (referred to as GUP)
A malware loader comprised of a legitimate libcurl.dll file with one export function modified to execute shellcode.
A communications module (referred to as SodomNormal) which creates a C&C channel with the GUP proxy tool.

A remote access Trojan component (referred to as SodomMain), which is delivered following decoding the initial
beacon response received via the GUP proxy tool and the SodomNormal local host proxy module.
GUP Proxy Tool
The GUP command and control proxy tool may impersonate the name of a piece of legitimate opensource software
available at wingup[.]org, which is used by Notepad++. In historic campaigns by APT adversaries, legitimate GUP.exe
versions were utilized that were digitally signed by Notepad++. In this campaign, files appeared to impersonate the
GUP.exe file name rather than being a legitimate signed binary. The function of this tool is to set up a TCP listener on a
localhost, receive encoded data via requests from the SodomNormal localhost module, and to forward this data to the
command and control IP via HTTP. The GUP Proxy Tool has a hardcoded configuration which is included as both strings
and integers. The following configuration data was identified from the analyzed sample.
GUP[.] exe|368ae77c829c29db2c3e719ce423104db86165422391403ad0483944aa287c20
Listener address: 127.0.0.1
Listener port: 9090
C&C host: 103.253.41[.]45
C&C URL format: http://%s/status[.]gif?r=%d
Observed URL: http://103.253.41[.]45/status.gif?r=1564065990
Libcurl.dll Malware Loader
This dynamic link library appears to be a legitimate version of libcurl.dll except for a single exported function, which is
referred to as ordinal #52 and curl_share_init in the analyzed sample. This function has been modified by threat actors to
extract a resource contained within libcurl.dll, decrypt malicious data included in that resource, and load the resulting DLL
to execute a malicious function. When this function is executed, the SodomNormal communications module begins
running within Libcurl.dll. In addition to loading the communications module, the initial macro described above configures
a persistence mechanism for this malware loader by setting up a Registry Run key. The non-concatenated command
included in the macro that establishes persistence for Libcurl.dll and the hash for this sample are included below.
cmd /c reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v CurlUpdate /f /d rundll32.exe
C:\Users\Public\libcurl.dll,#52
Libcurl.dll| cf57eb331b09cb2bc8992ea253d301161f1fa38583cba0733ea6dc2da2bdf740
SodomNormal Communications Module
The SodomNormal Communications module runs within the libcurl.dll loader as a loaded DLL. Its primary function is to
communicate data gathered by the SodomMain remote access Trojan module with the GUP Proxy Tool. It attempts to
acquire an existing configuration from the file sodom.ini. However, it appears the configuration is dropped in the file
sodom.txt instead. If that configuration is not available, it utilizes a hardcoded configuration in the binary. An example of
this hardcoded configuration has been included below. The tool uses a custom binary protocol over sockets for its
command and control communication with the GUP Proxy Tool and all transferred data is encrypted using a modified
version of RC4 encryption. It has limited functionality which includes an initial beacon, an initial beacon response that
includes encoded data containing the SodomMain RAT, and a command poll which passes header and decrypted data in
an exported function enabling the SodomMain RAT to run. The hash for this sample is included below.

SodomMain Remote Access Trojan Module
The SodomMain module is LookBack malware’s remote access Trojan module that can send and receive numerous
commands indicative of its function as a RAT. The malware is delivered within the encoded data that is received by
the SodomNormal module as part of its initial beacon response. It then runs within the SodomNormal module and uses
its “send_data” function for C&C communications. The data is ultimately relayed to the GUP Proxy Tool and the C&C IP.
Noteworthy malware commands include:
Get process listing
Kill process
Executes cmd[.] exe command
Gets drive type
Find files
Read files
Delete files
Write to files

Notes on Attribution

6/8

Analysts identified similarities between the macros utilized in this campaign and historic APT campaigns targeting
Japanese corporations in 2018 [1]. Moreover, LookBack utilizes an encoded proxy mechanism for C&C communication
that resembles a historic TTP utilized in those campaigns. However, analysts note that the LookBack malware has not
previously been associated with a known APT actor and that no additional infrastructure or code overlaps were identified
to suggest an attribution to a specific adversary.
In the attachments identified as part of the July 2019 campaigns, threat actors appeared to utilize many concatenation
commands within the macro to obfuscate the VBA function. It is possible these concatenations were an attempt to evade
static signature detection for the macro strings while maintaining the integrity of the installation mechanism, which had
been historically been used to target different sectors and geographies. The below comparison indicates the shared
macro content which appears to have been rewritten.

Conclusion
The detection of a new malware family delivered using phishing tactics once used by known APT adversaries highlights a
continuing global risk from nation-state actors. While definitive attribution in this instance requires further study of
infrastructure, toolsets, and methodologies, the risk that these campaigns pose to utilities providers is clear. The profile of
this campaign is indicative of specific risk to US-based entities in the utilities sector. Phishing emails leveraged the
knowledge of the licensing bodies utilized within the utilities sector for social engineering purposes that communicated
urgency and relevance to their targets. Persistent targeting of any entity that provides critical infrastructure should be
considered an acute risk with a potential impact beyond the immediate targets. Since so many other individuals and
sectors rely on these services to remain operational safeguarding them is paramount. Analysts continue to monitor key
entities in the utilities sector to identify and prevent these and similar attacks in the hopes of preventing any intended
impact to critical infrastructure.
