A new data wiper and info-stealer called ThiefQuest is using ransomware as a decoy to
steal files from macOS users. The victims get infected after downloading trojanized
installers of popular apps from torrent trackers.
While not common, ransomware has been known to target the macOS platform in the past,
with KeRanger, FileCoder (aka Findzip), and Patcher being three other examples of
malware designed to encrypt Mac systems.
ThiefQuest was first spotted by K7 Lab malware researcher Dinesh Devadoss and analyzed
by Malwarebytes' Director of Mac & Mobile Thomas Reed, Jamf Principal Security
Researcher Patrick Wardle, and BleepingComputer's Lawrence Abrams, who found an
interesting twist.

Installs a keylogger and opens a reverse shell

Devadoss discovered that ThiefQuest includes the capability to check if it's running in a
virtual machine (more of a sandbox check according to Wardle), and it features anti-debug
capabilities.
It also checks for some common security tools (Little Snitch) and antimalware solutions
(Kaspersky, Norton, Avast, DrWeb, Mcaffee, Bitdefender, and Bullguard) and opens a
reverse shell used for communication with its command-and-control (C2) server as VMRay
technical lead Felix Seele found.
The malware will connect to http://andrewka6.pythonanywhere[.]com/ret.txt to get the IP
address of the C2 server to download further files and send data.
"Armed with these capabilities the attacker can maintain full control over an infected host,"
Wardle said.

Distributed as pirated apps on torrent sites
As Reed found after examining the ransomware, ThiefQuest is dropped using infected
installers wrapping legitimate software including but not limited to Little Snitch, Ableton, and
Mixed in Key.
Even though the malicious .PKG installers downloaded from popular torrent sites are code
signed and look just as any legitimate installer would when launched, they are distributed as
DMG files and don't have a custom icon, a warning sign that something is not quite right for
many macOS users.
Reed also found that, in the case of one of the ThiefQuest samples analyzed, the packages
of compressed installer files include the pirated apps' original installers and uninstallers,
together with a malicious patch binary and a post-install script used to launch the installer
and launch the malware.

ThiefQuest also copies itself into ~/Library/AppQuest/com.apple.questd and creates a
launch agent property list at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.questd.plist with a
RunAtLoad key set to true to automatically get launched whenever the victim logs into the
system.
After gaining persistence on the infected device, ThiefQuest launches a configured copy of
itself and starts encrypting files appending a BEBABEDD marker at the end.

Unlike Windows ransomware, ThiefQuest has issues starting to encrypt files. When it does,
it isn't picky.
It seems to be locking files randomly, generating various issues on the compromised
system from encrypting the login keychain to resetting the Dock to the default look, and
causing Finder freezes.

"Once file encryption is complete, it creates a text file named READ_ME_NOW.txt with the
ransom instructions," Wardle added, and it will also display and read a modal prompt using
macOS' text-to-speech feature letting the users know that their documents were encrypted.
The victims are asked to pay a $50 ransom in bitcoins within three days (72 hours) to
recover their encrypted files and are directed to read a ransom note saved on their
desktops.

Suspiciously, ThiefQuest is using the same static Bitcoin address for all victims and does
not contain an email address to contact after payment has been made.
This makes it impossible for the attackers to identify victims who paid the ransom, and for a
victim to contact the ransomware operators for a decryptor.
Combining a static Bitcoin address with a lack of contact methods is a strong indication that
the ransomware is a wiper instead.
Wipers, though, are usually used as a cover for some other malicious activity.

Wiper malware used for data theft
After the malware was analyzed by BleepingComputer's Lawrence Abrams, we believe that
the ransomware is simply a decoy for the true purpose of this malware.
That is to search for and steal certain file types from the infected computer.
When the malware is executed on a Mac, it will execute shell commands that download
Python dependencies, Python scripts disguised as GIF files, and then run them.

Executed shell commands
Source: BleepingComputer
The tasks conducted by the above command are:
Delete the /Users/user1/client/exec.command and /Users/user1/client/click.js files.
Download and install PIP
Install the Python 'requests' dependency
Download p.gif, which is a Python file, and execute it.
Download pct.gif, which is another Python file, and execute it.
The p.gif file is a heavily obfuscated Python script, and we have not been able to determine
what its functionality is.

Heavily obfuscated Python script

Of particular interest in the above file is the comment:

5/12

# n__ature checking PoC
# TODO: PoCs are great but this thing will
# deliver much better when implemented in
# production

The pct.gif file is not obfuscated and is clearly a data exfiltration script that steals files under
the /Users folder and sends it to a remote URL.

Data exfiltration script
Source: BleepingComputer
When executed, this script will search for any files under the /Users folder that contain the
following extensions
.pdf, .doc, .jpg, .txt, .pages, .pem, .cer, .crt, .php, .py, .h, .m, .hpp, .cpp,
.cs, .pl, .p, .p3, .html, .webarchive, .zip, .xsl, .xslx, .docx, .ppt, .pptx,
.keynote, .js, .sqlite3, .wallet, .dat

For any files that matches the search criteria, it will base64 encode the contents of the file
and send it and the path of the file back to the threat actors Command & Control server.
These files include text files, images, Word documents, SSL certificates, code-signing
certificates, source code, projects, backups, spreadsheets, presentations, databases, and
cryptocurrency wallets.
To illustrate how this may look on the other end for the threat actor, BleepingComputer
created a proof-of-concept script that accepted the requests from the above data-stealing
script.

PoC of receiving of stolen files
Source: BleepingComputer
While our PoC only logs the contents of a file to our log file, it could have written each file to
a folder matching the victim's IP address.
One interesting feature of this script is that it will not transfer any files greater than 800KB in
size.
Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, who BleepingComputer shared the script with, agreed with
our findings and pointed out that many of the searched file types are generally over 800KB
in size.

What victims should do?
As you can see, the ThiefQuest wiper is much more damaging than first thought, as not
only will data be encrypted, but it may not even be decryptable if a victim pays.
To make matters worse, the malware will steal files from your computer that contain
sensitive information that could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including
identity theft, password harvesting, stealing of cryptocurrency, and stealing private security
keys and certificates.
If you were infected with this malware, you should assume any files that match the listed
extensions have been stolen or compromised in some manner.
While it is not known if a decryptor can be made, users can install Wardle's free
RansomWhere utility, which detects ThiefQuest's attempts to gain persistence and allows
them to terminate it once it starts locking their files.
Reed also says that Malwarebytes for Mac is capable of detecting this new macOS
ransomware as Ransom.OSX.ThiefQuest and will remove it from infected Macs.
At the moment, researchers are still looking into what encryption ThiefQuest uses to encrypt
its victims' files and if there are any weaknesses in the encryption.

Update July 02, 09:00 EDT: We updated the title and the article to reflect the malware's
name change to ThiefQuest from EvilQuest (a name used by Chaosoft Games Xbox 360
and PC video game since 2012.)

YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ARE ENCRYPTED
Many of your documents, photos, videos, images and other files are no longer
accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to
recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your file without
our decryption service.
We use 256-bit AES algorithm so it will take you more than a billion years to break
this encryption without knowing the key (you can read Wikipedia about AES if you
don't believe this statement).
Anyways, we guarantee that you can recover your files safely and easily. This will
require us to use some processing power, electricity and storage on our side, so
there's a fixed processing fee of 50 USD. This is a one-time payment, no additional
fees included.
In order to accept this offer, you have to deposit payment within 72 hours (3 days)
after receiving this message, otherwise this offer will expire and you will lose
your files forever.
Payment has to be deposited in Bitcoin based on Bitcoin/USD exchange rate at the
moment of payment. The address you have to make payment is:
13roGMpWd7Pb3ZoJyce8eoQpfegQvGHHK7
Decryption will start automatically within 2 hours after the payment has been
processed and will take from 2 to 5 hours depending on the processing power of your
computer. After that all of your files will be restored.
THIS OFFER IS VALID FOR 72 HOURS AFTER RECEIVING THIS MESSAGE

The fix for wipers and ransomware is obvious
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should formally designate
Apple and Microsoft Operating Systems as national security threats to the integrity of
U.S. communications networks or the communications supply chain.
Easy Peasy
LoL
We can ask nicely for physical write protect switches on our drives and SSD's for
another 40 years to protect our backups from malware but we ain't getting them are
we?
My backups are on write protected Blu-Ray Optical Discs!
Where's yours?

vuksha_xc60 - 1 year ago

Maybe it's better to use SD cards for that purpose instead of Blueray discs.

10/12

Some-Other-Guy - 1 year ago

Definitely not!
SD cards are normally rated to retain your data for 12-18 months
Blu-Ray retains data for several years
(over 1000 years for M-Disc)
SD cards cost much more than Blu-Ray discs
SD write protection can be defeated easily
Blu-Ray protection cannot
and lets not forget labelling....
Ever try finding the right backup on hundreds of SD cards?
It is much easier to read the contents of a properly labelled optical disc

As we're talking about personal backups, you can create a single container backup
using 7zip or something, dump all the stuff in there and manually change the
extension to something ransomware ignores and is not conspicuous. If that container
is big enough, there's a good chance it will be unattractive for encryption or
exfiltration. For example, some custom game archive extensions can be pretty big in
size, so use one of those, why not? Heck, you can even use a ransomware extension!
