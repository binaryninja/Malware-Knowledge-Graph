Severe Vulnerability Uncovered in Major Taiwan Financial Software
Taipei, Taiwan — 22 February 2022 — CyCraft, a leading managed detection and response
(MDR) provider based in Taiwan, uncovered intelligence regarding the November 2021
cyberattacks targeting the Taiwan financial and securities trading sector; CyCraft further
attributed the cyberattacks to — a China state-sponsored hacker group widely believed to be
associated with the Chinese Intelligence Agency, the .
The November 2021 attacks were originally attributed to password mismanagement;
however, following a security incident response (IR) investigation conducted by CyCraft into
the second wave of February 2022 attacks, new evidence uncovered the exploitation of a
severe vulnerability in commonly used financial software aided by a newly identified hacking
technique, .

These attacks are the latest in a series of attack campaigns against Taiwan by China-based
threat groups. In early 2020, CyCraft curtailed a year-long attack campaign targeting
Taiwan’s semiconductor ecosystem; this attack was attributed to another China-based threat
group, Chimera. Again, in April 2020, a CyCraft incident response (IR) investigation into a
government agency breach uncovered Waterbear malware — malware designed and
distributed by the China-based threat group BlackTech.
The frequency of cyberattacks targeting Taiwan institutions surged by 38% in 2021,
reaching an average of 2,644 attacks per week, Taiwan News reports. The global average is
925 attacks per week. This disparity is due to Taiwan’s unique geopolitical situation, hightech economy, and mature communications infrastructure.

First Attack Wave, November 2021
At 5:27 p.m. on Thursday, November 25 of last year, a number of Taiwan financial institutions
and securities traders informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE) and the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) that they would be suspending online transactions
due to suspicious behavior — large, unusual purchases of Hong Kong stocks on consumer
trading accounts — as a result of a cyberattack.
After several weeks, the IR investigations theorized that the November attacks were most
likely due to password mismanagement and credential stuffing; however, the findings were
not conclusive and suggested there may have been other causes.
Credential stuffing attacks leverage poor cyber hygiene habits (i.e., users reusing the same
username/password combinations across multiple platforms and websites). Several security
countermeasures were taken, including forced password updates and multi-factor
authentication.

Second Attack Wave, February 2022
Once again, in mid-February 2022, a number of Taiwan financial institutions and securities
traders were targeted — some being victims of the November 2021 attacks and others
CyCraft customers. CyCraft MDR/EDR cybersecurity solutions observed suspicious files and
login events on customer servers and immediately began investigating. After three days,
CyCraft completed their IR investigations.

CyCraft’s three-day IR investigation uncovered that neither the February 2022 nor the
November 2021 attacks were solely a direct result of credential stuffing. A more thorough
investigation revealed evidence suggesting credential stuffing was purposely left behind by
APT10 — credential stuffing was just a smokescreen.
Both attacks were the result of a supply chain attack targeting specific financial
software. A vulnerability existing in financial software with a majority market share among
Taiwan securities traders was exploited by the attackers, granting them high-level access to
multiple firms. Further investigation showed that what was initially presumed to be two
separate waves of cyberattacks was actually one prolonged attack campaign in which the
attackers leveraged advanced obfuscation techniques not previously observed.
This isn’t the first “smokescreen attack” by a China-based threat group. In April 2020,
CyCraft observed a China-based threat group use ransomware as a smokescreen for a
targeted attack on the CPC Corporation, as reported by CyCraft and Bloomberg.
“For more than a decade, Chinese hackers have waged a persistent cyber offensive
against Taiwanese government, non-government and corporate targets. Taiwan also
happens to be home to some of the electronics, semiconductor, and military
technology that China desperately wants to get its hands on.”

Attack Attribution
Analysis of the attacker C2 domain, the Quasar backdoor malware, and the attacker
behavior used in the attacks has led to a high degree of confidence in attributing the attacks
to a Chinese threat actor. In the second wave of attacks observed by CyCraft, there is a
medium degree of confidence in the attribution of APT10 — a China-based threat group.

The objective of these attacks does not appear to have solely been financial gain but
rather the exfiltration of brokerage information, the scraping of high-value PII data,
damaging the reputation of Taiwan financial institutions, and the disruption of investor
confidence during a period of economic growth for Taiwan.
One of the many attack techniques utilized by APT10 was the new technique “Reflective
Code Loading”, which was incorporated into the MITRE ATT&CK framework just last
October.

ABOUT APT10
This Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), known as APT10 by MITRE ATT&CK nomenclature,
has been active since at least 2006. Common targets of APT10 include healthcare, defense,
finance, maritime, biotechnology, energy, and governmental organizations, with an emphasis
on targets in Japan and Taiwan. APT10 is believed to be associated with the Chinese
Intelligence Agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two members of APT10, Zhu Hua and
Zhang Jianguo, with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire
fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The Department of Justice charges that these
individuals acted in association with the Tianjin State Security Bureau and had been
engaging in global computer intrusions for more than a decade.
