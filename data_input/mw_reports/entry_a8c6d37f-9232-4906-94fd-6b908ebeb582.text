CHINA

“Beijing One Pass” Employee
Benefits Software Exhibits
Spyware Characteristics

July 29, 2021

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Executive Summary
A Recorded Future client provided information to
Insikt Group relating to a potential security incident
triggered by a software application called “Beijing One
Pass”. This Chinese government-backed application
enables access to state benefits information and was
downloaded by employees of the Recorded Future
client after they were informed that paper copies of the
information would no longer be available.
Insikt Group independently verified that the installed
application exhibits characteristics consistent with
potentially unwanted applications (PUA) and spyware.
The software is associated with the Beijing Certificate
Authority (北京数字认证股份有限公司), which is a Chinese
state-owned enterprise (BJCA, www.bjca[.]cn).
Some notable suspicious behaviors relate to several
dropped files and subsequent processes initiated from
the primary application. These behaviors include a
persistence mechanism, the collection of user data such
as screenshots and keystrokes, a backdoor functionality,
and other behaviors commonly associated with malicious
tools, such as disabling security and backup-related
services.

Whatever the motive, installing such software
on devices that have access to sensitive data is not
advised. Recorded Future recommends that companies
with China-based employees who need access to state
benefit information using “One Pass” software not use
it on devices with access to sensitive corporate data.

Analysis
During preliminary analysis, Insikt Group found that
the “Beijing One Pass” PC client exhibits behaviors
similar to spyware applications. The software contains
built-in functionality that, taken in aggregation, raise
considerable suspicions about the implication of its data
collection capabilities:
• Ability to autorun at Windows startup to ensure
persistence
• Checking periodically for human interaction with
the operating system as the file is run
• Attempting to read, create, or modify system
registry ROOT certificates
• Disabling security and backup services on the
host device
• Allowlisting domains for ActiveX use, which
potentially allows it to connect to additional
internet resources
• Reading data from the clipboard

We cannot confirm the intent behind Beijing One
Pass’s containing spyware-like capabilities; however,
the presence of software with similar spyware-like
functionality, developed by at least one other Chinese
region, the Shaanxi CA, is notable. These capabilities
could be evidence of a deliberate attempt to gain access
to devices (such as in support of China’s Cybersecurity
Law that allows security organizations to inspect
corporate networks remotely), the result of lax security
practices by the certificate authorities (CA) and
developers, or features designed to comply with Chinese
laws and regulations.

There is also some indication that the file contains
backdoor functionality to open a port and listen for
incoming connections. This functionality is present in
a driver that accompanies the CertAppEnv installation
called “wmControl.exe”. We also observed anti-analysis
capability within the application, which is typically
associated with malware.

Based on data provided by the Recorded Future client, the
“Beijing One Pass” application requires the installation of the
“Certificate Application Environment” software. This software
appears to be developed by the Chinese state-owned enterprise
Beijing Certificate Authority (北京数字认证股份有限公司). Upon
installation of the One Pass PC client, the subsequent process
tree that is spawned is detailed in Figure 1 and was investigated
further by Insikt Group analysts.

Stage 1 — Services.exe
The parent process, services.exe, is a benign executable
found on Windows machines that launches the Services Control
Manager, responsible for starting, interacting with, and ending
services. Common processes such as svchost.exe and taskhost.
exe are often spawned by services.exe. This particular version
of services.exe was first released by Microsoft on April 13, 2021,
in a Windows 10 security update (KB5001337), indicating that
the One Pass process infection chain may have been adapted
since then to include this file as the initial loader.

Three separate files, all tagged as malicious by AV engine
vendors, had also dropped the same BJCAUpdate.exe file
previously:
• BJCAUpdateSetup.exe
• Certappenv_setupv3.3.01.19082.exe
• BJCAV2.14.exe
BJCAUpdateSetup.exe, flagged as adware by AV engines,
drops several additional temporary files that attempt to call out
to update.bjca.org[.]cn, tied to the BJCA certificate authority.
Several subdomains associated with bjca.org[.]cn have been
flagged in public sandboxing services and open source material
as being affiliated with malicious potentially unwanted application
(PUA) activity, including in an application called BjTax analyzed
by Sophos.

File BJCAV2.14.exe is picked up by Microsoft as a PUA, labeling
the file as PUA:Win32/ZfkeyMonitoring. This “ZfkeyMonitoring”
signature is likely linked to the “zfkeymonitor.exe” file, which
open source information indicates could be a signed loader used
to deploy malware onto networks.

Stage 3 — CertAppEnv_UpdateV2.14.2toV2.14.3.exe

Other suspicious characteristics of the process include
installing itself to autorun at Windows startup to ensure
persistence and checking for human interaction with the
operating system as the file is run. The process also attempts
to connect to domain time.bjca[.]org[.]cn due to the presence
of the BJCA code signing certificate in the file.

Pivoting through malware multiscanner repositories,
it is clear that there are dozens if not more versions of both
“BJCAUpdate.exe” and “CertAppEnv_Update” in circulation.
While some appear to be benign based on clean verdicts from AV
engines, a significant proportion trigger AV for PUA or spyware
applications based on behavioral malware analysis of the files.
The varying AV detections for different versions could be due
to inconsistent overly restrictive signaturing methods or could
indicate that certain functionality was introduced into updated
software versions that forced the AV engine detections.

Outlook
It remains to be seen if this new policy change is corroborated
by other international companies based in China, but the potential
ramifications of having employees install state-backed software
that exhibits spyware-type characteristics raise concern.
Given the exceptional circumstances brought about by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the need for governments to devise
new policy and benefit programs to support their citizens during
lockdowns, introducing digital platforms to manage state benefits
is a reasonable step to reduce inefficiencies. However, Recorded
Future’s analysis of “Beijing One Pass” and associated software
intrinsically tied to Provincial/Municipality certificate authorities
in China highlights suspicious spyware-like functionalities that
include a persistence mechanism, collection of user data such as
screenshots and keystrokes, backdoor functionality, and other
behaviors commonly associated with malicious tools, such as
disabling security and backup-related services.
While we cannot confirm the intent behind Beijing One Pass
containing spyware-like capabilities, installing such software
on devices that have access to sensitive data is not advised.
Recorded Future recommends that companies with Chinabased employees who need access to state benefit information
using “One Pass” software not use it on devices with access to
sensitive corporate data.

Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy
Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat
actors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China,
Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals —
individuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China,
Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and
where possible, attributing them to nation state government,
organizations, or affiliate institutions.

ADVERSARY

Our coverage includes:
•

•

Government organizations and intelligence
agencies, their associated laboratories, partners,
industry collaborators, proxy entities, and
individual threat actors

INFRASTRUCTURE

Recorded Future-identified, suspected nationstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,
RedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many
other industry established groups

•

Cybercriminal individuals and groups established
and named by Recorded Future

•

Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,
persistent commodity malware

CAPABILITY

VICTIM

Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group
or campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically
have data corresponding to at least three points on the
Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium
confidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity
using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21
where the activity is new and significant but doesn't map
to existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged
into an established activity group. We tie this to a threat
actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,
or organization responsible. We will write about the activity
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary
data. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a
particular group when the public body of empirical evidence
is clear the activity corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet
naming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups
or campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that
nation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be
added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt
Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the
Greek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity
connected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate
country color, and where that group may be tied to a specific
government organization, tie it to that entity specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming
newly identified malware.
