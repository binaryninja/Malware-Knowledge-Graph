2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of
COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president
election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping
numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) .
In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities.
Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them
are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our
observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.
In this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:
Evolution of APT tactic

Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks
COVID-19 driven cyber attacks
We will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view,
which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion
and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.

Evolution of APT tactic
In 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several
energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized
campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political
deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it
has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed
Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but
the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.
Another cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS
platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with
attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors
abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5
intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese
APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also
verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack. We consider both events to
be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not
observed in the past.

Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks
Supply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and
TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the
most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500
companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the
scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar
attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to
infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau
(MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be

even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private
corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct
China nexus group were involved in these operations.

COVID-19 driven cyber attacks
Another interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the
outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence
for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing
COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In
Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure
theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend
will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.
TeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in
2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and
attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are
active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of
Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information
Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a
dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of
threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be
good hopping points by actors to access various industries.
The third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at
least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to
control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime.
Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they
tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision
makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor
industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered
by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was
also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also
two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph,
COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we
would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which
we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related
entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from
this specific group.

2020 APT target industries distribution
TeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China.
HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their
attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost
all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs
were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse,
BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are
quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial
entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their
footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this
group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility
from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and
take control of them in case of emergency status.
AMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and
IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft.
But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what
they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code
names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years.
Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT
group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their
spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID4/6

19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last
interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a
notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the
victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But
the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their
government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese
bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still
exist in Taiwan.

Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020

Conclusion
The purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of
Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective
defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex
and impossible for a security product to defend. TeamT5 has a cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
centered solution, ThreatVision, and we rely on a dedicated team of security experts to keep
us steps ahead of threat actors. Feel free to contact TeamT5 in case you want to know more
