BrushaLoader still sweeping up victims one year later

July 22, 2019 Kafeine and the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team
Overview
BrushaLoader is one of a growing group of downloaders frequently employed by threat actors to profile infected
PCs and then load more robust payloads on devices of interest. Malware like BrushaLoader contributes to the
ongoing trend of “quality over quantity” infections and enables threat actors to better stay under the radar than they
can with highly disruptive infections like ransomware or when distributing massive malicious spam campaigns with
high-profile malware as their primary payload. At the same time, these loaders can also deliver those same
disruptive infections if threat actors choose to load ransomware as secondary payloads, a scenario we have
observed on multiple occasions recently.
BrushaLoader itself first appeared in June 2018 [1]. Now, just over a year later, we have observed the loader in a
number of campaigns by prominent threat actors. We derived the name for this VisualBasic/JavaScript/PowerShell
loader from the “Rusha” author of the command and control (C&C) panel.

Analysis
Immediately after executing, BrushaLoader receives a PowerShell script called "PowerEnum" [5] (Figure 2).

here); captured February 7, 2019

PowerEnum performs extensive fingerprinting on infected devices and sends the data back to the C&C. This
communication occurs over a raw TCP "parallel" channel to BrushaLoader. PowerEnum is also used to send
tasks, which were originally stored on Dropbox [2][3], and more recently were hosted on Google Drive
[4].PowerEnum is integral to BrushaLoader and shares the same C&C infrastructure. Interestingly, we also
observed PowerEnum as a Fallout EK payload delivering Danabot Affid "4" (Figure 3)

and a BackConnect Socks.dll
Payloads
BrushaLoader is strongly connected to the Danabot banking Trojan Affid "3". However, this connection is not
exclusive as we have observed it in conjunction with other malware as well (Figure 4).

The C&C panel
Early in its distribution, we observed the BrushaLoader C&C panel and were surprised by the success of a “basic”
campaign using compressed-VBS attachments. Despite requiring several user interactions, the actors were able to
ensnare more than 4,000 computers in 36 hours (Figures 5 and 6).

Conclusion
Though one of many downloaders in regular use, BrushaLoader has emerged in connection with numerous
secondary payloads such as DanaBot and prolific actors including TA544. We have observed it in multiple
geographies and a variety of campaigns. Moreover, insights from the command and control panel suggest high
infection success rates for the loader, enabling deployment of a range of payloads by actors using the malware.
While loaders fail to garner headlines like high-profile ransomware attacks, they have emerged as a key element
of many threat actors’ toolkits. We will continue to monitor trends around this malware family and BrushaLoader in
particular.
