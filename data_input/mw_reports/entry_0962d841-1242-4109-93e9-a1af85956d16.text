APT Cyber Tools Targeting ICS/SCADA Devices
SUMMARY
The Department of Energy (DOE), the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National
Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity
Advisory (CSA) to warn that certain advanced
persistent threat (APT) actors have exhibited the
capability to gain full system access to multiple
industrial control system (ICS)/supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) devices, including:




Schneider Electric programmable logic
controllers (PLCs),
OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and
Open Platform Communications Unified
Architecture (OPC UA) servers.

Actions to Take Today to Protect
ICS/SCADA Devices:
● Enforce multifactor
authentication for all remote
access to ICS networks and
devices whenever possible.
● Change all passwords to
ICS/SCADA devices and
systems on a consistent
schedule, especially all default
passwords, to device-unique
strong passwords to mitigate
password brute force attacks
and to give defender monitoring
systems opportunities to detect
common attacks.

The APT actors have developed custom-made tools for

actors can compromise Windows-based engineering
workstations, which may be present in information technology (IT) or OT environments, using an
exploit that compromises an ASRock motherboard driver with known vulnerabilities. By compromising

and maintaining full system access to ICS/SCADA devices, APT actors could elevate privileges,
move laterally within an OT environment, and disrupt critical devices or functions.
DOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI urge critical infrastructure organizations, especially Energy Sector
organizations, to implement the detection and mitigation recommendations provided in this CSA to
detect potential malicious APT activity and harden their ICS/SCADA devices.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
APT actors have developed custom-made tools that, once they have established initial access in an
OT network, enables them to scan for, compromise, and control certain ICS/SCADA devices,
including the following:




Schneider Electric MODICON and MODICON Nano PLCs, including (but may not be limited
to) TM251, TM241, M258, M238, LMC058, and LMC078;
OMRON Sysmac NJ and NX PLCs, including (but may not be limited to) NEX NX1P2, NXSL3300, NX-ECC203, NJ501-1300, S8VK, and R88D-1SN10F-ECT; and
OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.

The APT actors’ tools have a modular architecture and enable cyber actors to conduct highly
automated exploits against targeted devices. The tools have a virtual console with a command
interface that mirrors the interface of the targeted ICS/SCADA device. Modules interact with targeted
devices, enabling operations by lower-skilled cyber actors to emulate higher-skilled actor capabilities.
The APT actors can leverage the modules to scan for targeted devices, conduct reconnaissance on
device details, upload malicious configuration/code to the targeted device, back up or restore device
contents, and modify device parameters.
In addition, the APT actors can use a tool that installs and exploits a known-vulnerable ASRocksigned motherboard driver, AsrDrv103.sys, exploiting CVE-2020-15368 to execute malicious code in
the Windows kernel. Successful deployment of this tool can allow APT actors to move laterally within
an IT or OT environment and disrupt critical devices or functions.

APT Tool for Schneider Electric Devices
The APT actors’ tool for Schneider Electric devices has modules that interact via normal management
protocols and Modbus (TCP 502). Modules may allow cyber actors to:






Run a rapid scan that identifies all Schneider PLCs on the local network via User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) multicast with a destination port of 27127 (Note: UDP 27127 is a standard
discovery scan used by engineering workstations to discover PLCs and may not be indicative
of malicious activity);
Brute-force Schneider Electric PLC passwords using CODESYS and other available device
protocols via UDP port 1740 against defaults or a dictionary word list (Note: this capability may
work against other CODESYS-based devices depending on individual design and function,
and this report will be updated as more information becomes available);
Conduct a denial-of-service attack to prevent network communications from reaching the PLC;

TLP:WHITE




Sever connections, requiring users to re-authenticate to the PLC, likely to facilitate capture of
credentials;
Conduct a ‘packet of death’ attack to crash the PLC until a power cycle and configuration
recovery is conducted; and
Send custom Modbus commands (Note: this capability may work against Modbus other than
in Schneider Electric PLCs).

Refer to the appendix for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this tool.

APT Tool for OMRON
The APT actors’ tool for OMRON devices has modules that can interact by:







Scanning for OMRON using (Factory Interface Network Service (FINS) protocol;
Parsing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response from OMRON devices;
Retrieving the media access control (MAC) address of the device;
Polling for specific devices connected to the PLC;
Backing up/restoring arbitrary files to/from the PLC; and
Loading a custom malicious agent on OMRON PLCs for additional attacker-directed
capability.

Additionally, the OMRON modules can upload an agent that allows a cyber actor to connect and
initiate commands—such as file manipulation, packet captures, and code execution—via HTTP
and/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).
Refer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.

APT Tool for OPC UA
The APT actors’ tool for OPC UA has modules with basic functionality to identify OPC UA servers and
to connect to an OPC UA server using default or previously compromised credentials. The client can
read the OPC UA structure from the server and potentially write tag values available via OPC UA.
The threat from this tool can be significantly reduced by properly configuring OPC UA security. Refer
to the Mitigations below for more information.
Refer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.

MITIGATIONS
Note: these mitigations are provided to enable network defenders to begin efforts to protect systems
and devices from new capabilities. They have not been verified against every environment and should
be tested prior to implementing.
DOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI recommend all organizations with ICS/SCADA devices implement the
following proactive mitigations:


Isolate ICS/SCADA systems and networks from corporate and internet networks using strong
perimeter controls, and limit any communications entering or leaving ICS/SCADA perimeters.



Enforce multifactor authentication for all remote access to ICS networks and devices
whenever possible.
Have a cyber incident response plan, and exercise it regularly with stakeholders in IT,
cybersecurity, and operations.
Change all passwords to ICS/SCADA devices and systems on a consistent schedule,
especially all default passwords, to device-unique strong passwords to mitigate password
brute force attacks and to give defender monitoring systems opportunities to detect common
attacks.
Ensure OPC UA security is correctly configured with application authentication enabled and
explicit trust lists.
Ensure the OPC UA certificate private keys and user passwords are stored securely.
Maintain known-good offline backups for faster recovery upon a disruptive attack, and conduct
hashing and integrity checks on firmware and controller configuration files to ensure validity of
those backups.
Limit ICS/SCADA systems’ network connections to only specifically allowed management and
engineering workstations.
Robustly protect management systems by configuring Device Guard, Credential Guard, and
Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI). Install Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions
on these subnets and ensure strong anti-virus file reputation settings are configured.
Implement robust log collection and retention from ICS/SCADA systems and management
subnets.
Leverage a continuous OT monitoring solution to alert on malicious indicators and behaviors,
watching internal systems and communications for known hostile actions and lateral
movement. For enhanced network visibility to potentially identify abnormal traffic, consider
using CISA’s open-source Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP).
Ensure all applications are only installed when necessary for operation.
Enforce principle of least privilege. Only use admin accounts when required for tasks, such as
installing software updates.
Investigate symptoms of a denial of service or connection severing, which exhibit as delays in
communications processing, loss of function requiring a reboot, and delayed actions to
operator comments as signs of potential malicious activity.
Monitor systems for loading of unusual drivers, especially for ASRock driver if no ASRock
driver is normally used on the system.
