APT36 ( a.k.a Transparent Tribe / Mythic Leopard / PROJECTM/ TEMP ) is a
prominent group believed to be operating on behalf of Pakistan state and conducting
espionage with great interests in a very specific set of countries specially India, widely
since 2013.
Most frequent target sectors include:
Military organizations
Government entities

Example honey trap lure template

Cyberstanc's very own threat research team have been tracking APT36's activities
and we would like to provide you an insight into their tradecraft specially their main
malware dubbed "Crimson RAT".

Analysis:
We won't be laying emphasis on individual samples rather we would be randomly
covering samples and variants to provide better insights

Payload Delivery:
Transparent Tribe employees multitude of tactics from the old books of espionage 101
for dummies for example honey-trapping army personals however frequent payload
delivery methods constitutes of usually the following:
1/10

Malicious Documents / Excel sheets
Compressed archived files
Waterholing attack
Basic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual
instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide
information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow
you to produce simple network signatures.
Filename : Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx
File Type : MS Word Document
File size 300.00 KB (300000 bytes)
Stage 1 (Macro enabled document dropper) :

Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx

Kashmir_conflict_actions.docx contains a macro which in turn makes a remote
SQL query to C2 server (Datroapp[.]mssql.somee.com) and writes the second
stage payload to "\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\Trayicos.exe" and launches the payload

Stage 2 (Dropper) :
Basic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual
instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide
information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow
you to produce simple network signatures.
Filename : TrayIcos.exe
File Type : PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit
File size : 2.4 MB (2519552 bytes)
MD5 : 18ACD5EBED316061F885F54F82F00017
Signature : Microsoft Visual C++ 8
Initial looks at the PE file straight up looks like a payload loader of some sorts specially
looking at the resource section of the file we can see a data blob with bigger size than
usual and an exceptionally high entropy value.

Pestudio resource viewer

Further analysis indicates the same with a import chain of :
FindResource -> LoadResource -> LockResource -> SizeofResource -> FreeResource

Getting 3rd stage payload from resource

We can clearly conclude the encrypted data block located in the resource section is the
3rd stage payload.
After some dynamic analysis we are able to decrypt the 3rd stage payload. However
we are not finished yet ! Once the 3rd stage payload is decrypted which in turn is
revealed as a .NET assembly its loaded in the memory space of the same unmanaged
process "TrayIcos.exe" .

Managed payload method called from unmanaged parent dropper

Stage 3 (Third stage dropper):
Basic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual
instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide
information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow
you to produce simple network signatures.
Filename : Random.dll
File Type : C# dynamic link library / .Net Assembly
File size : 2.3 MB (2441216 bytes)
MD5 : 4A22A43CCAB88B1CA50FA183E6FFB6FA
Signature : Microsoft Visual C# v7.0 / Basic .NET
We get a unpacked / obfuscated C# assembly which we dumped during the dynamic
analysis of the 2nd stage dropper.
The functionality of the dropper is pretty straight forward payload from resource and
then execute entrypoint of the payload.

3rd stage dropper

Stage 4 (Crimson RAT):
Final stage includes execution of our crown king Crimson Remote Access Trojan.
Basic static analysis consists of examining the sample without viewing the actual
instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide
information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow
you to produce simple network signatures.
Filename : TrayIcos.exe
File Type : PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit
Mono/.Net assembly

File size : 2.2 MB (2295808 bytes)
MD5 : 5A27D092E4A87554206F677B4EADC6F5
Signature : Microsoft Visual C# v7.0 / Basic .NET
Packer : .Net Reactor
Crimson RAT supports basic functionalities a remote access trojan should have like
screen capture, screen size enumeration, commands execution, process list, process kill,
etc.
However the functionalities differ from variant to variant and are stripped in many
samples however the complete list of all functionalities supported by the framework are
listed below :

Command parser and functionalities of crimson rat

Persistence mechanism is the least notable and extremely basic in nature

HKCU Run key persistence

C2 communication is implemented using simple TCP protocol with no added
encryption / encoding even which is highly disappointing.

C2 connection using TCP

Verdict:
Overall Transparent Tribe's tradecraft might seem lackluster but since their inception in
2013 they have been quite successful according to statistics in executing their plans and
conducting espionage campaigns on daily basis. However our customers are protected
against this threat. Additionally, Scrutiny Anti Malware properly files used by
Transparent Tribe as malicious.
