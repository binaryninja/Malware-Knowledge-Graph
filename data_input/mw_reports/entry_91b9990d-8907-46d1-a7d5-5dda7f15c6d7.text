In April 2017, ShadowBrokers published their well-known ‘Lost in Translation’ leak, which,
among other things, contained an interesting script that checked for traces of other APTs in
the compromised system.

In 2018, we found an APT described as the 27 th function of this script, which we call
‘DarkUniverse’. This APT was active for at least eight years, from 2009 until 2017. We assess
with medium confidence that DarkUniverse is a part of the ItaDuke set of activities due to
unique code overlaps. ItaDuke is an actor known since 2013. It used PDF exploits for
dropping malware and Twitter accounts to store C2 server urls.

Technical details
Infection vector
Spear phishing was used to spread the malware. A letter was prepared separately for each
victim to grab their attention and prompt them to open an attached malicious Microsoft
Office document.
Each malware sample was compiled immediately before being sent and included the latest
available version of the malware executable. Since the framework evolved from 2009 to
2017, the last releases are totally different from the first ones, so the current report details
only the latest available version of the malware used until 2017.
The executable file embedded in the documents extracts two malicious files from itself,
updater.mod and glue30.dll, and saves them in the working directory of the malware –
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Reorder.
After that, it copies the legitimate rundll32.exe executable into the same directory and uses
it to run the updater.mod library.

The updater.mod module
1/7

This module is implemented as a dynamic-link library with only one exported function,
called callme@16. This module is responsible for such tasks as providing communication
with the C2 server, providing the malware integrity and persistence mechanism and
managing other malware modules.
The persistence mechanism is provided by a link file, which is placed by updater.mod into
the startup folder, ensuring malware execution after a reboot. If the link file becomes
corrupted, the updater.mod module restores it.

Communication with C2
In this campaign the C2 servers were mostly based on cloud storage at mydrive.ch. For
every victim, the operators created a new account there and uploaded additional malware
modules and a configuration file with commands to execute it. Once executed, the
updater.mod module connected to the C2 and performed the following actions:
downloaded the command file to the working directory;
uploaded files collected and prepared by additional malicious modules (if any) to the
C2. These files were located in a directory called ‘queue’ or ‘ntfsrecover’ in the working
directory. Files in this directory could have one of two extensions: .d or .upd
depending on whether they had already been uploaded to the server or not.
downloaded additional malware modules:
dfrgntfs5.sqt – a module for executing commands from the C2;
msvcrt58.sqt – a module for stealing mail credentials and emails;
zl4vq.sqt – legitimate zlib library used by dfrgntfs5;
%victim_ID%.upe – optional plug-in for dfrgntfs5. Unfortunately, we were unable
to obtain this file.
All malware modules are encrypted with a custom algorithm:

The credentials for the C2 account are stored in the configuration that is placed in the
registry, but the updater.mod module also stores a copy as an encrypted string in the
executable file. Also, the configuration specifies how often updater.mod polls the C2,
supporting both an active mode and a partly active mode.

Malware configuration in the registry
The malware configuration is stored in the registry in the
SOFTWARE\AppDataLow\GUI\LegacyP entry. Different values are detailed in the following
table:

Value
name

Description

C1

C2 domain.

C2

C2 domain path.

C3

C2 credential username.

C4

C2 credential password.

install

1 if malware is installed.

TL1

DESACTIVAR | HABILITAR – specifies whether msvcrt58 and glue
libraries are active.

TL2, TL3

If TL1 is not NULL, it specifies time bounds when TL1 option is applied.

“kl”

If 1, updater.mod should download msvcrt58.sqt from C2 again.

“re”

If 1, updater.mod should download dfrgntfs5.sqt from C2 again.

“de”

If not 0, framework should uninstall itself.

“cafe”

REDBULL | SLOWCOW specifies how often updater.mod polls C2.

“path”

Path to the folder from which files are being sent to C2.

Modules glue30.dll and msvcrt58.sqt
The glue30.dll malware module provides keylogging functionality. The updater.mod module
uses the Win API function SetWindowsHookExW to install hooks for the keyboard and to
inject glue30.dll into processes that get keyboard input. After that, glue30.dll loads and
begins intercepting input in the context of each hooked process.
The msvcrt58.sqt module intercepts unencrypted POP3 traffic to collect email conversations
and victims’ credentials. This module looks for traffic from the following processes:
outlook.exe;
3/7

winmail.exe;
msimn.exe;
nlnotes.exe;
eudora.exe;
thunderbird.exe;
thunde~1.exe;
msmsgs.exe;
msnmsgr.exe.
The malware parses intercepted POP3 traffic and sends the result to the main module
(updater.mod) for uploading to the C2. This is done by hooking the following networkrelated Win API functions:
ws2_32.connect;
ws2_32.send;
ws2_32.recv;
ws2_32.WSARecv;
ws2_32.closesocket.

The dfrgntfs5.sqt module
This is the most functional component of the DarkUniverse framework. It processes an
impressive list of commands from the C2, which are listed in the following table.

Command

Description

VER

Sends malware version to server.

DESINSTALAR

Uninstalls itself.

PANTALLA

Takes screenshot of the full screen and saves it to the \queue
folder.

CAN_TCP,
CAN_HTTP,
CAN_HTTPS

Injects a shellcode into IE that establishes a direct connection
with the C2, downloads additional code, sends info about the
download results to the C2 and executes the downloaded code.

MET_TCP,
MET_HTTPS

Also injects a shellcode into IE. The only difference with the
previous command set is that in this case the shellcode doesn’t
send any additional info to the C2 – it only establishes the
connection, downloads additional code and executes it.

4/7

CAN_HTTP_LSASS

Injects the same shellcode as in the case of CAN_HTTP into the
LSASS.exe process.

SCAN/STOPSCAN

Starts/stops network scan. Collects lots of different info about
the local network.

Victimology
We recorded around 20 victims geolocated in Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, Ethiopia,
Sudan, Russia, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates. The victims included both civilian and
military organizations. We believe the number of victims during the main period of activity
between 2009 and 2017 was much greater.

Conclusions
DarkUniverse is an interesting example of a full cyber-espionage framework used for at
least eight years. The malware contains all the necessary modules for collecting all kinds of
information about the user and the infected system and appears to be fully developed from
scratch. Due to unique code overlaps, we assume with medium confidence that
DarkUniverse’s creators were connected with the ItaDuke set of activities. The attackers
were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full lifecycle of their
operations, so the observed samples from 2017 are totally different from the initial samples
6/7

from 2009. The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the ‘Lost in
Translation’ leak, or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern
approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations.
