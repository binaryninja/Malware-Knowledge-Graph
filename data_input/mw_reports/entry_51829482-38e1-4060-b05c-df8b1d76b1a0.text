Introduction
Agent Tesla is a Windows-based keylogger and RAT that commonly uses SMTP or FTP to
exfiltrate stolen data. This malware has been around since 2014, and SMTP is its most
common method for data exfiltration.
Earlier today, I reviewed post-infection traffic from a recent sample of Agent Tesla. This
activity revealed a change in Agent Tesla's SMTP data exfiltration technique.
Through November 2021 Agent Tesla samples sent their emails to compromised or possibly
fraudulent email accounts on mail servers established through hosting providers. Since
December 2021, Agent Tesla now uses those compromised email accounts to send stolen
data to Gmail addresses.

Shown above: Flow chart of recent change in Agent Tesla SMTP data exfiltration.
SMTP exfiltration before the change
Agent Tesla is typically distributed through email, and the following sample was likely an
attachment from malicious spam (malspam) sent on 2021-11-28.

Any.Run analysis from 2021-11-29: link
The packet capture (pcap) from Any.Run's analysis shows a typical SMTP data exfiltration
path. The infected Windows host sent a message with stolen data to an email address, and
that address was on a mail server established through a hosting provider.

Shown above: TCP stream of SMTP traffic shows stolen data sent to the compromised
email account.
Example after the change
The following Agent Tesla sample was likely an attachment from malspam sent on 2021-1201.

Any.Run analysis from 2021-12-01: link
The pcap from Any.Run's analysis of this malware sample shows a new data exfiltration
path. The infected Windows host sent a message with stolen data to a Gmail address using
a compromised email account from a mail server established through a hosting provider.

Shown above: Traffic from the Any.Run analysis filtered in Wireshark.

5/7

Shown above: TCP stream shows stolen data sent to Gmail address using the compromised
email account.
Final words
The basic tactics of Agent Tesla have not changed. However, post-infection traffic from
samples since 2021-12-01 indicates Agent Tesla using STMP for data exfiltration now sends
to Gmail addresses. Based on the names of these addresses, I believe they are fraudulent
Gmail accounts, or they were specifically established to receive data from Agent Tesla.
