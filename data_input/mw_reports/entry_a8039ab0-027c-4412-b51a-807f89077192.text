A number of Symantec customers affected by wide-ranging trawl for
potential targets of interest.
UPDATE December 16 2020: Our blog has been updated with analysis of the Teardrop
second-stage malware and an example of the post-compromise attack chain. We have also
provided clarification on the use of Symantec’s name in a certificate used to sign the
SolarWinds software.
Thousands of organizations have been affected by a supply chain attack that compromised
the update mechanism for SolarWinds Orion software in order to deliver a backdoor Trojan
known as Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst) (aka Solorigate).
Details on the attacks were disclosed yesterday (December 13) by the security firm FireEye.
SolarWinds has also published a security advisory for its customers.
The campaign has been underway since at least March 2020. Any Orion user who
downloaded an update in this period is likely to have been infected with Sunburst. According
to FireEye, the attackers conducted further malicious activity on a subset of victim
organizations that were of interest to them.
By their nature, supply chain attacks are indiscriminate and will infect any user of the
compromised software. They are carried out in order to provide the attacker with access to a
large number of organizations, a subset of which will be identified as targets of interest for
further compromise.
The Trojanized software was signed by a certificate marked as being issued by Symantec.
Symantec sold its certificate authority business to Digicert in 2018. The certificate in question
was a legacy certificate still using the Symantec brand name. Symantec has contacted
Digicert, which has confirmed that it is investigating the issue.
Symantec has identified more than 2,000 computers at over 100 customers that received
Trojanized software updates. We have found a small number of organizations where a
second stage payload (Backdoor.Teardrop) was used.

Sunburst analysis
An existing SolarWinds DLL called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll was modified
by the attackers to include an added class.
The malware is designed to remain inactive for a period after installation. It will then attempt
to resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The DNS response will deliver a CNAME
record that directs to a command and control (C&C) domain.

In
SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.BackgroundInventory.InventoryManager.RefreshInterval()
code is added to call OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize().
OrionImprovementBusinessLayer is a malicious class added by the attacker. It has the
following functionality:
Terminates the backdoor thread
Set delay time before execution
Collect and upload system information including:
Domain
SID of administrator account
Hostname
Username
Operating system version
Path of system directory
Days elapsed since the system started
Information on network adapters, including:
Description
MACAddress
DHCPEnabled
DHCPServer
DNSHostName
DNSDomainSuffixSearchOrder
DNSServerSearchOrder
IPAddress
IPSubnet
DefaultIPGateway
Download and run code
Iterate the file system
Create and delete files
Calculate file hashes
Read, write, and delete registry entries
Reboot the system

Second-stage payload: Teardrop
A second stage payload, a backdoor called Teardrop, is deployed against a targets of interest
to the attackers. Symantec has observed two variants of Teardrop, both of which behave
similarly and are used to deliver a further payload – the Cobalt Strike commodity malware.
The first variant (SHA256:
b820e8a2057112d0ed73bd7995201dbed79a79e13c79d4bdad81a22f12387e07) is a DLL.
The malicious code is contained in the export Tk_CreateImageType, ordinal 209. When

executed, that malicious code reads a file named upbeat_anxiety.jpg from the current
directory and ensures it has a jpg header. It will also check that the registry key
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\CTF exists. An embedded copy of Cobalt Strike is then extracted
and executed. That CobaltStrike sample connects to infinitysoftwares[.]com for command
and control.
The second variant
(SHA256:1817a5bf9c01035bcf8a975c9f1d94b0ce7f6a200339485d8f93859f8f6d730c) is
similar, except that the file it loads is called festive_computer.jpg. The embedded
CobaltStrike payload connects to ervsystem[.]com for command and control.

Post-compromise attack chain
The post-compromise attack chain for one computer investigated saw the initial Sunburst
malware, a modified solarwinds.orion.core.businesslayer.dll, installed through the Orion
update process on the victim computer on the 7th of the month.
On the 28th of the month, 21 days later, the legitimate executable
solarwinds.businesslayerhost.exe, which loads the malicious DLL, created a copy of
Teardrop in a file called cbsys.dll, in the c:\windows\panther folder. This filename and path
appear to be unusual since most instances of Teardrop were created in a file called
netsetupsvc.dll in the c:\windows\syswow64 folder, as documented by FireEye.
The Backdoor.Teardrop sample is a DLL with malicious code contained in the export
Tk_CreateImageType. When executed, that export reads a file named upbeat_anxiety.jpg
from the current directory and ensures it has a jpg header. It will also check that the registry
key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\CTF exists. An embedded copy of Cobalt Strike is then
extracted. That CobaltStrike samples connects a C&C server - infinitysoftwares[.]com.
At this point, the attackers launch WMI to execute rundll32.exe to load another malicious DLL
called resources.dll in the path csidl_windows\desktoptileresources\. Resources.dll attempts
to obtain credentials by accessing lsass.exe using similar techniques to Mimikatz, a widely
used credential dumping tool.
Adfind, a tool that is able to query Active Directory, is then introduced to the system as
searchindex.exe and then executed (cmd.exe /c SearchIndex.exe -sc u:<removed> > .\h.txt).
Results are saved in the file h.txt. Using this information, the attackers are attempting to gain
elevated privileges (e.g. domain administrator) to access the domain or laterally traverse the
environment.

Recommended actions
Orion users should update to Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 2.
Orion users should check their networks for indications of post-compromise activity,
including:
Use of Teardrop in-memory malware to drop Cobalt Strike Beacon.
6/8

Command and control (C&C) infrastructure leaks the configured hostname in RDP SSL
certificates. Scanning for your organization’s hostnames can uncover malicious IP
addresses used by the attackers, indicating post-compromise activity.
Geolocation of IP addresses used for remote access may reveal if a compromised
account is being simultaneously used by a legitimate user and the attackers.
The attackers use multiple IP addresses per VPS provider. If a malicious login from an
unusual ASN is identified, other logins from that ASN may also be malicious.
Logs for SMB sessions may show access to legitimate directories and follow a deletecreate-execute-delete-create pattern in a short period of time.
It should be borne in mind that although there may be some commonalities in postcompromise activity, each victim is likely to see different patterns in activity. That activity is
likely to involve heavy use of living-off-the-land techniques to minimize the likelihood of being
detected, something the attackers seem to be prioritizing based on how they conducted the
first stages of the attack.

Protection/Mitigation
Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running
Symantec Endpoint products.
