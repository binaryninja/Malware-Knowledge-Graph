Executive Summary
Code signing certificates have been used since Stuxnet incident (2011) as of today. Malware
using code signing certificate is classified as highly reliable software and is less likely to be
detected by Anti Virus (AV). It is known that attackers prefer code signed certificates as the

most of current Internet and security systems are oriented toward trust and reputation
dependent models.
Code signing certificates began to be sold on the dark web from around 2015 to 2016, and
are mostly spotted on Russian speaking forums. Until recently, code signed certificates are
being sold by various sellers on the forums and prices ranging from $400 to $3500
depending on the grade of the certificate.
It is important to consider the fact that this criminal ecosystem being active is that sellers
have been constantly supplying certificates of legitimate companies, which can be seen that
those of companies and developers‚Äô lack of security awareness and negligence of
management provided the cause of hacking code signing certificates processing servers.
Most of the code signing certificate issues had already been a big issue in the past, so many
people regard this issue as just an old case. However, attackers are still interested in code
signing certificate servers and still being traded on the dark web or via hidden channels.

According to the seller, it can issue a certificate of global brand C that issues SSL
certificates. And the price ranges from $500 to $2600.
If you develop a software without code signing, the biggest difference is in the User Account
Control (UAC) part when executing the software.

CodeSigning vs SSL Certificate

As can be seen from above diagram, the main difference between SSL certificate and code
signing certificate is whether you own a website or you publish downloadable software,
applications, etc.
If so, let‚Äôs have a look how the EV is different in the code signature.

Code Signing vs Code Signing EV
3/13

The code signing EV mentioned by seller means Extended Validation (EV) code signing
certificates, which differs from the general code signing certificate in that the private key is
stored in a separate hardware token in the case of EV. The most noticeable difference when
running the software is that the Windows Smart Screen Filter warning does not appear when
using EV code signing certificates.

Because of this, many cybercriminals use code signed certificate to increase the success
rate of attacks when creating malwares.
However, the certificate cannot be issued by anyone, it is required to submit documents such
as business registration certificate, tax payment certificate, and etc. to authorities and go
through examination process. Therefore, attackers directly steal the code sign certificate by
compromising legitimate company‚Äôs certification server, or purchase it from the dark web
sellers.
Then, let‚Äôs take a look at how many sellers are still active on the dark web forums.

Conclusion
Malware signed with stolen certificates have been found constantly. As mentioned earlier, the
reason why the criminal ecosystem is still active today is that there is an abundance of
supply chains in which hackers constantly bringing legitimate companies‚Äô certificates.
It is difficult for general companies to cope with malicious code signed with legitimate
companies certificates. Therefore, the most fundamental solution is to raise the security
awareness of companies and developers for the code signing certificate server and manage
them in cautious manner.
