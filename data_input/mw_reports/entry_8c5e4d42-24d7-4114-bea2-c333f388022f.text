Executive Summary
SentinelLabs has identified a new cluster of threat activity targeting Russian organizations.
We assess with high-confidence that the threat actor responsible for the attacks is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber
espionage group, as also recently noted by Ukraine CERT (CERT-UA).
The attacks use phishing emails to deliver Office documents to exploit targets in order to deliver their RAT of choice, most
commonly Bisonal.
SentinelLabs has also identified associated activity targeting telecommunication organizations in Pakistan leveraging
similar attack techniques.

Overview
On June 22nd 2022, CERT-UA publicly released Alert #4860, which contains a collection of documents built with the Royal
Road malicious document builder, themed around Russian government interests. SentinelLabs has conducted further analysis
of CERT-UA’s findings and has identified supplemental Chinese threat activity.
China’s recent intelligence objectives against Russia can be observed in multiple campaigns following the invasion of Ukraine,
such as Scarab, Mustang Panda, ‘Space Pirates’, and now the findings here. ​Our analysis indicates this is a separate Chinese
campaign, but specific actor attribution is unclear at this time.
While the overlap of publicly reported actor names inevitably muddies the picture, it remains clear that the Chinese intelligence
apparatus is targeting a wide range of Russian-linked organizations. Our findings currently offer only an incomplete picture of
this threat cluster’s phishing activity, but they serve to provide perspective into an attacker’s ongoing operational objectives and
a framework for our ongoing research.

Malicious Documents Targeting Russia

1/7

On June 22nd , Ukraine’s CERT-UA reported several RTF documents containing malicious code exploiting one or more
vulnerabilities in MS Office. CERT-UA assessed that the documents, “Vnimaniyu.doc”,
“17.06.2022_Protokol_MRG_Podgruppa_IB.doc”, and “remarks table 20.06.2022_obraza”, were likely built with the Royal Road
builder and dropped the Bisonal backdoor. Royal Road is a malicious document builder used widely by Chinese APT groups,
while Bisonal is a backdoor RAT unique to Chinese threat actors.
The CERT-UA advisory followed public reporting by our colleagues from nao_sec and Malwarebytes, who identified some of
the first indicators and shared related samples and C2 servers. Building off this initial intelligence, SentinelLabs discovered a
further related cluster of activity.

Timeline of Royal Road Malicious Documents
As we have observed over the years, Royal Road documents follow content themes relevant to their targets. Following that
practice, it’s reasonable to assume that the targets in this recent cluster of activity are likely Russian government organizations.
One example of this cluster (f599ed4ecb6c61ef2f2692d1a083e3bb040f95e6) is a fake document mimicking a RU-CERT memo
on increased phishing attacks.

The example documents shown above both exploit CVE-2018-0798, a remote execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office to
install the embedded malware.

Attribution to Chinese Threat Groups
The collection of files and infrastructure noted above could be considered related to the Tonto Team APT group (aka
“CactusPete”, “Earth Akhlut”), a Chinese threat group that has been reported on for nearly ten years. However, we assess that
link with only medium confidence due to the potential for shared attacker resources that could muddy attribution based on the
currently available data. Known targets span the globe, with a particular interest in Northeast Asia, including governments,
critical infrastructure, and other private businesses.
The attacker continues their long history of Russian targeting; however, the rate of Russian and Russia-relevant targets in
recent weeks may indicate increased prioritization.
There are multiple connections of this activity to Chinese threat actors. As noted above, the documents are built with a
commonly known malicious document builder used widely by Chinese APT groups, the shared toolkit often referred to as the
“Royal Road” or the “8.t” builder.
These documents often contain metadata indicating the document creator’s operating system was using simplified Chinese, a
trait we observed in our previous analysis of Scarab APT activity.
The malicious documents are generally used for the delivery of custom malware, such as the Bisonal RAT, which as noted by
CERT-UA, is unique to Chinese groups, including Tonto Team. Bisonal has a uniquely long history of use and continued
development by its creators, such as expanding features for file searching and exfiltration, anti-analysis and detection
techniques, and maintaining generally unrestricted system control.
Additionally, the collection of C2 infrastructure associated with these various samples fall under a larger umbrella of known
Chinese APT activity.

Related Activity of Interest

5/7

It’s also worth noting that there are still ongoing related attacks focused on non-Russian organizations, such as those against
Pakistan.
For example, one file uploaded to VirusTotal (91ca78231bcacab0d5e6194041817b96252e65bf) from Pakistan is a May 2022
email message file to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, sent from a potentially compromised account in the Cabinet
Division of the Pakistani government. This email contains the Royal Road attachment “Please help to Check.doc”
(f444ff2386cd3ada204c3224463f4be310e5554a), dropping 85fac143c52e26c22562b0aaa80ffe649640bd29 and beaconing
outbound to instructor.giize[.]com (198.13.56[.]122).

Phishing email containing malicious document

Conclusion
We assess with high confidence that the Royal Road-built malicious documents, delivered malware, and associated
infrastructure are attributable to Chinese threat actors. Based on our observations, there’s been a continued effort to target
Russian organizations by this cluster through well-known attack methods– the use of malicious documents exploiting n-day
vulnerabilities with lures specifically relevant to Russian organizations. Overall, the objectives of these attacks appear
espionage-related, but the broader context remains unavailable from our standpoint of external visibility.
