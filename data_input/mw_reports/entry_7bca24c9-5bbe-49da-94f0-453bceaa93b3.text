By Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C. Chen (Threat Researchers)
We recently discovered a new campaign that we dubbed “Operation Overtrap” for the numerous ways it can infect or trap
victims with its payload. The campaign mainly targets online users of various Japanese banks by stealing their banking
credentials using a three-pronged attack. Based on our telemetry, Operation Overtrap has been active since April 2019 and has
been solely targeting online banking users located in Japan. Our analysis found that this campaign uses three different attack
vectors to steal its victims’ banking credentials:
By sending spam emails with a phishing link to a page disguised as a banking website
By sending spam emails asking victims to run a disguised malware’s executable downloaded from a linked phishing
page.
By using a custom exploit kit to deliver malware via malvertising

This blog will discuss how we discovered the campaign and introduce the brand-new banking trojan Cinobi. Meanwhile, a
detailed look at the different attack vectors associated with this campaign, and a more in-depth analysis of dropped
conﬁguration ﬁles as well as Cinobi’s features, are discussed in our technical brief.

Technical Analysis
Discovering Operation Overtrap
We ﬁrst discovered the campaign in September 2019 using a then-unidentiﬁed exploit kit. Based on our data, Operation
Overtrap has been using spam emails to deliver its payload to victims as early as April 2019.
In mid-September, we observed a signiﬁcant number of victims being redirected to the exploit kit, which targeted Internet
Explorer, after they have clicked on links from social media platforms. It should be noted, however, that the way the victims
received the links has not been identiﬁed. It is also worth mentioning that Operation Overtrap only seems to target Japanese
online banking users; it redirects victims with other geolocations to a fake online shop.
Upon analysis, we saw that the exploit kit only dropped a clean binary that does not perform malicious activities on a victim’s
device. It also immediately closes after infection. It is still unclear why the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap initially
delivered a clean binary ﬁle; it’s possible that they were testing their custom exploit kit during this stage of the campaign’s
development.

Operation Overtrap’s Custom Exploit Kit: Bottle Exploit Kit
On September 29, 2019, we observed that the exploit kit ceased to drop a clean ﬁle, and instead, delivered a brand-new
banking trojan that we dubbed “Cinobi.” We also noted that the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap have stopped
redirecting victims from social media and began to use a Japan-targeted malvertising campaign to push their custom exploit
kit.
Another researcher later discovered the custom exploit kit, which was named the Bottle Exploit Kit (BottleEK). It exploits
CVE-2018-15982, a Flash Player use after free vulnerability, as well as CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript remote code execution
vulnerability. Victims will be infected with BottleEK’s payload if they access this particular exploit kit’s landing page with
unpatched or outdated browsers. Our telemetry shows that BottleEK was the most active exploit kit detected in Japan in
February 2020.

Network™)

Brand-new banking malware: Cinobi
Operation Overtrap used a new banking malware we’ve decided to call Cinobi. Based on our analysis, Cinobi has two versions
— the ﬁrst one has a DLL library injection payload that compromises victims’ web browsers to perform form-grabbing.
This Cinobi version can also modify web trafﬁc sent to and received from targeted websites. Our investigation found that all
the websites that this campaign targeted were those of Japan-based banks.
Aside from form-grabbing, it also has a webinject function that allows cybercriminals to modify accessed webpages. The
second version has all the capabilities of the ﬁrst one plus the ability to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C)
server over the Tor proxy.

Cinobi’s four stages of infection
Each of Cinobi’s four stages contains an encrypted position-independent shellcode that makes analysis slightly more
complicated. Each stage is downloaded from a C&C server after certain conditions have been met.

First stage
The ﬁrst stage of Cinobi’s infection chain, which has also been analyzed by another cybersecurity researcher, starts by calling
the “GetUserDefaultUILanguages” function to check if the infected device’s local settings are set to Japanese.

Figure 5. Screengrab of Cinobi’s check to determine the device’s language settings using “GetUserDefaultUILanguages”
Cinobi will then download legitimate unzip.exe and Tor applications from the following locations:
ftp://ftp[.]cadwork.ch/DVD_V20/cadwork.dir/COM/unzip[.]exe
https://archive[.]torproject[.]org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/8.0.8/tor-win32-0.3.5.8[.]zip
After extracting the Tor archive into the “\AppData\LocalLow\” directory, Cinobi will rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe and
execute it. It will also run tor.exe with custom torrc ﬁle settings.
“C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\<random_name>\Tor\taskhost.exe” –f
“C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\<random_name>\torrc”
It will download the second stage of the malware payload from a .onion C&C address and save it in a randomly named .DLL
ﬁle within the “\AppData\LocalLow\” folder. The ﬁlename of the ﬁrst stage downloader is saved into a .JPG ﬁle with a random
name.

After this, Cinobi will run the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine.

Figure 7. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi running the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine

Second stage
Cinobi will connect to its C&C server to download and decrypt the ﬁle for the third stage of its infection chain. We observed
that the ﬁlename of the third stage starts with the letter C, followed by random characters. Afterward, it will download and
decrypt the ﬁle for the fourth stage, which has a ﬁlename that starts with the letter A, followed by random characters.
After these, Cinobi will download and decrypt a conﬁg ﬁle (<random_name>.txt) that contains a new C&C address.
Cinobi uses RC4 encryption with a hardcoded key.

Next, Cinobi will run the downloaded third stage infection ﬁle using the UAC bypass method via the CMSTPLUA COM
interface.

Third stage
During the third infection stage, Cinobi will copy malware ﬁles from “\AppData\LocalLow\” to the “%PUBLIC%” folder. It
will then install the fourth stage of the downloader (which was downloaded during the second stage) as Winsock Layered
Service Provider (WSCInstallProviderAndChains).

Figure 9. Screengrab of code showing the installation of the infection’s fourth stage on the victim machine as
“WSCInstallProviderAndChains”
Cinobi will then perform the following actions:
Change spooler service conﬁg to “SERVICE_AUTO_START”
Disable the following services:
UsoSvc
Wuauserv
WaaSMedicSvc
SecurityHealthService
DisableAntiSpyware
Copy and extract Tor ﬁles to “%PUBLIC%” folder
Rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe
Create torrc in “%PUBLIC%” with the content “DataDirectory C:\Users\Public\<random_nam>\data\tor”
Create .JPG ﬁle with the original dropper name
Remove ﬁles from “\AppData\LocalLow\,” remove original dropper ﬁle

Fourth stage
Cinobi will call the WSCEnumProtocols function to retrieve information about available transport protocols. It will also call
the WSCGetProviderPath function to retrieve the DLL path of the original transport provider. This function is called twice.
The ﬁrst call will return the malicious provider (as the fourth stage of the malware has already been installed during the third
stage of infection). The second call will return the original transport provider (“%SystemRoot%\system32\mswsock.dll”) and
resolve and call its WSPStartup function. Cinobi will then check the name of the process in which the malicious DLL provider
gets injected. In practice, Cinobi should be injected into all processes that make network connections using Windows sockets.

Best practices against spam and vulnerabilities
Operation Overtrap uses a variety of attack vectors to steal banking credentials. Users and organizations need to adopt best
practices to protect their systems against messaging-related threats and avoid malicious advertisements. An example of a best
practice is to have a central point for reporting suspicious emails. Organizations, through their IT teams, need to have a

centralized information gathering system, and all employees must be aware of the reporting procedure for suspicious emails.
Meanwhile, users can avoid malicious advertisements by avoiding clicking on suspicious links or pop-ups and updating
software via ofﬁcial channels.
Organizations will beneﬁt from regularly updating systems (or use virtual patching for legacy systems) to prevent attackers
from taking advantage of security gaps. Additional security mechanisms like ﬁrewalls and intrusion detection and prevention
systems will help thwart suspicious network activities such as data exﬁltration or C&C communication.
