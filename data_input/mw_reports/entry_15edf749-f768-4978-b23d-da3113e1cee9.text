This blog was made possible through contributions from Fred Chidsey and Joseph Lozowski.
The 2023 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index shows that vulnerability discovery has rapidly
increased year-over-year and according to X-Force’s cumulative vulnerability and exploit
database, only 3% of vulnerabilities are associated with a zero day. X-Force often observes
zero-day exploitation on Internet-facing systems as a vector for initial access however, XForce has also observed zero-day attacks leveraged by attackers to accomplish their goals
and objectives after initial access was obtained.
In this post, X-Force will detail an investigation associated with a zero-day attack that
occurred less than 24 hours after the release of the zero day — one of the fastest adoption
times for financially motivated cybercriminals identified by X-Force since 2020. This incident
is connected to a recent mass ransomware attack, which takes advantage of a vulnerability
in Forta’s file-transfer tool, GoAnyWhere.
This blog will also explore the relationship between ransomware attack paths and the
adoption of zero days by cybercriminals: by analyzing the most commonly used zero-day
exploits by cybercriminals observed by X-Force over the last three years, we’ve found that
the ransomware attack lifecycle is a key driver behind zero-day adoption for cyber criminals.

GoAnyWhere But Laterally
In February 2023, X-Force responded to an incident where a client had received alerts from
their security tooling regarding potential lateral movement originating from a server within
their network. The client’s security team discovered an authorized user account operating on
a GoAnyWhere MFT server. Through analysis of existing security telemetry and forensic
evidence, X-Force identified evidence of post-exploitation activity and exploitation of CVE2023-0669 on the GoAnyWhere MFT server.
X-Force uncovered exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 through timeline analysis indicating a
common post-exploitation command to download a file from a remote IP address was
executed on the GoAnyWhere server at the same time a GoAnyWhere license error log was
written referencing the same remote IP address. Upon first exploitation, the attacker
attempted to download and execute a malicious payload which would have established a
command and control (C2) channel via a Cobalt Strike but the security tooling on the
GoAnyWhere server detected and removed the malicious payload. X-Force recovered
similar evidence indicating that the attacker attempted to execute Mimikatz through the
exploitation of the vulnerability and was prevented.
With security tooling blocking the execution of remote post-exploitation commands, the
attacker pivoted to interactive access via remote desktop protocol (RDP) by leveraging the
vulnerability to create a new user account and then accessing the server via RDP. With
interactive access to the server via RDP, the attacker continued with credential harvesting
operations by accessing credential data using Task Manager to dump the contents of the
LSASS process.
Following the credential harvesting operations, the attacker began internal reconnaissance
focusing on Active Directory using CSVDE and scanning for accessible SMB shares.
Comma Separated Value Directory Exchange (CSVDE) is Microsoft Windows utility that
enables the user to import and export objects into or from Active Directory.
The attacker pivoted C2 channels by uploading a web shell to the GoAnyWhere server and
began executing point-exploitation commands focused on reconnaissance and user account
creation. When the web shell was detected and contained, the attacker returned to the
server through RDP and performed more credential harvesting activities and leveraged
SharpHound to perform additional Active Directory data collections. SharpHound is a
component of BloodHound which is an Active Directory reconnaissance tool designed to
enumerate and analyze Active Directory relationships and attack paths.
With an understanding of the attacker’s access and scope of the incident in place,
containment actions were taken to remove the attack from the network completely. Further
intelligence gathering of the data collected from the incident indicates that the attacker was a
financially motivated attacker focused on ransomware attacks to extort payment.

Detecting CVE-2023-0669
CVE-2023-0669 is a remote code injection vulnerability impacting Fortra’s GoAnyWhere MFT
file transfer software. The vulnerability enables a remote attacker with access to the
administrative console to inject pre-authentication commands in the License Response
Servlet. Exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 occurs when a remote attacker sends a specially
crafted request to the URI “/goanywhere/lic/accept” to take advantage of an insecure
deserialization flaw in the License Response Servlet class. Due to the use of hard-coded
keys within the source code of the GoAnyWhere functions, a remote attacker can encrypt
and encode arbitrary commands for execution on the target system within the Bundle
parameter which is processed by the License Server Servlet without authentication. It is
important to note that this exploit requires that the administrative interface for the
GoAnyWhere server is accessible to the attacker. At the time of writing this post, X-Force
detected over 700 GoAnyWhere servers available on the Internet with nearly 100
GoAnyWhere servers with the default license management ports exposed.

As detailed by security researcher, frycos, a payload to exploit the vulnerability can be
created using ysoserial and the hardcoded secret keys. Ysoserial, created by frohoff, is a
collection of utilities discovered in common java libraries that can exploit Java applications
vulnerable to unsafe deserialization of objects.

Detection Opportunity Via Process Execution
Invoking Process = <GoAnyWhereInstallDir>/GoAnywhere/jre/bin/java
Process Name = command interpreters or LOLBins (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, certutil.exe,
wmic.exe, whoami.exe, python, perl, bash, whoami, etc.)

Detection Opportunity Via Log Monitoring
Log file = %GoAnyWhereInstallDir%\userdata\logs\goanywhere.log
String Match = “request URI ‘/goanywhere/lic/accept/’ from ip address” AND “HTTP status
code is ‘500’”

Detection Opportunity Via Network Traffic
POST or GET to URI “<MFTServer>/goanywhere/lic/accept?bundle=” and URI contains
“bundle=” FROM Untrusted Hosts

Threat Driven Approach to Zero Days

5/9

During this incident, the time between the security advisory and the exploitation of CVE2023-0669 was less than 1 day making it one of the fastest adoption time frames by finically
motivated attackers observed by X-Force since 2020. The X-Force Vulnerability and Exploit
Database, which has been curating vulnerability and exploit data since 1993 shows that the
number of zero days released is increasing year over year, but X-Force observes just a
handful of zero days rapidly adopted by cyber criminals each year. It begs to question, “why
are some zero days rapidly and widely adopted for criminal operations and others not?”.
Based on the data from the X-Force database and incident response engagements, it
appears that that not every zero day is created equal. While every zero day is important and
organizations should still devote efforts to patching zero days once a patch is released, there
are characteristics of certain zero days that make them more likely to be rapidly and widely
adopted by cyber criminals.
The following CVEs were the most rapidly and widely adopted zero days by cyber criminals
observed by X-Force since 2020:
CVE-2020-1472 (ZeroLogon)
CVE-2021-26855 (ProxyLogon)
CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207 (ProxyShell)
CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare)
CVE-2022-26925 (PetitPotam)
CVE-2023-0669 (GoAnyWhere)
In 2021 X-Force released a blog detailing “How Ransomware Attacks Happen” and it turns
out that the attack path detailed in that post has a direct relationship with zero day adoption
by cyber criminals. Analyzing the most widely used zero days, what an attacker can achieve
through exploitation, and the incidents in which they were used, indicates that the zero days
that enable ransomware operators to quickly and easily obtain their goals and objectives are
more likely to be used “in the wild”.
ZeroLogon — Allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to a domain controller
to exploit a NetLogon session and gain domain administrator privilege.
PrintNightmare — Is a vulnerability affecting the Windows Print Spooler service that enables
an attacker to escalate privileges either locally or remotely by loading a malicious DLL which
will be executed as SYSTEM.
PetitPotam — Is a NTLM relay attack that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to take
control of an Active Directory domain by triggering a domain controller to relay its credentials
to a system controlled by the attacker. With the domain controller NTLM credentials, the
attacker can relay them to Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to obtain a DC
certificate. The attacker can use the DC certificate request a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)
and take control of the entire domain through Pass-The-Ticket attacks.

6/9

Because ZeroLogon, PrintNightmare, and PetitPotam allow an attacker to obtain privileged
access to Active Directory without credential harvesting or lateral movement, it significantly
simplifies the ransomware attack path and as such X-Force observed their use on multiple
ransomware attacks.
ProxyShell and ProxyLogon are vulnerabilities that affect on-premises Microsoft Exchange
that enable a remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on
vulnerable servers. Microsoft Exchange is an attractive target for attackers because they
host business email which can enable internal phishing as well as but also given the tight
integration between Exchange and Active Directory, it can also be exploited to move laterally
to other high-value systems or access privileged account credentials. According to Microsoft,
“If compromised, Exchange servers provide a unique environment that could allow attackers
to perform various tasks using the same built-in tools or scripts that admins use for
maintenance.”
X-Force has observed ProxyShell and ProxyLogon leveraged in multiple ransomware attacks
where the attacker was able to obtain domain administrator privileges, exfiltrate sensitive
business data, and deploy ransomware directly from the Exchange servers.
Regarding GoAnyWhere, X-Force’s observations are that the servers that are exploited tend
to be domain-joined Microsoft Windows system that enable the attacker to immediately
obtain an opportunity to gain access to high-value systems within Active Directory.
A notable absentee from the widely adopted zero-day list was Log4J. While Log4J gained
widespread media attention, X-Force did not respond to many serious finically motivated
incidents where Log4J was exploited. It is possible that organizations did a heroic job of
patching vulnerable systems, however, given the number of systems still vulnerable to CVE2021-44228 it appears that cyber criminals have not adopted it as widely for another reason.
One interesting data point that may explain why Log4J has not been observed in as many
incident response engagements is that based on X-Force vulnerability data, the majority of
vulnerable Log4J systems are running Linux. Pivoting from Linux to Microsoft Active
Directory requires more knowledge, capabilities and falls outside of the normal ransomware
attack lifecycle further indicating that the ransomware attack lifecycle is driving zero-day
adoption for cyber criminals.

A Path Forward: Understanding the Attackers
The path forward for zero-day preparation and management requires organizations adopt a
threat driven approach. It’s critical that organizations understand which attackers are most
likely going to target them, what the attackers’ goals and objectives are, and how the
attackers going about accomplishing them. With this knowledge, organizations will be better
prepared to identify which vulnerabilities and zero days are most likely going to be adopted.
But prevention alone is no longer enough. It’s equally important today to focus on detection

engineering – finding new ways to lengthen attack lifecycles and making it harder for threat
actors to execute their objectives. By improving detection and response capabilities,
businesses can make it more difficult for attackers to complete their goals even if they are
able to gain access through vulnerability exploitation.
