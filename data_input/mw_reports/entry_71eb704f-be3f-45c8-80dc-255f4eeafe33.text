The Rise of Dridex and the Role of ESPs
govcert.admin.ch/blog/28/the-rise-of-dridex-and-the-role-of-esps

Last week, we have warned Swiss citizens about a new malspam run targeting exclusively
Swiss internet users. The attack aimed to infect them with Dridex. Dridex is a sophisticated
eBanking Trojan that emerged from the code base of Bugat / Cridex in 2014. Despite
takedown attempts by the security industry and several arrests conducted by the FBI in
2015, the botnet is still very active. In 2016, MELANI / GovCERT.ch became aware of a
handful of highly sophisticated attacks against small and medium businesses (SMB) in
Switzerland aiming to steal large amounts of money by targeting offline payment software.
During our incident response in 2016, we could identify Dridex to be the initial infection
vector, which had arrived in the victim’s mailbox by malicious Office Word documents, and
uncovered the installation of a sophisticated malware called Carbanak, used by the attacker
for lateral movement and conducting the actual fraud. Between 2013 and 2015, the
Carbanak malware was used to steal approximately 1 billion USD from banks worldwide.

The Traditional Dridex Spam Runs
Dridex’s main infection vector is malspam. But unlike most of the spam that arrives at
internet users’ mailbox every day, spam mails distributing Dridex don’t originate from
compromised machines – so called spambots –, but rather from infrastructure rented by the
attackers themselves for the exclusive purpose of sending out their malspam mails. As the
IP addresses and domain names used to distribute Dridex are under control of the
attackers, all state-of-the-art methods are available to ensure the infrastructure as well as
the distributed spam emails look legit and therefore bypass common spam filters. For
example, Dridex spam usually originates from IP space of hosting companies with a valid
rDNS record which matches the sender’s domain name (from and envelope-from). In
addition, the sending domain names all have a valid SPF record (Sender Policy
Framework) matching the senders IP address. Nevertheless, spam filter- and DNSBL
provider did catch up in the recent weeks, doing a better job in detecting mails distributing
Dridex, marking them as spam. Therefore, we have seen less Dridex malspam emails being
delivered to the internet users’ mailboxes recently than we did before.

The Role of ESPs
In the past weeks, we could lean back a bit and watch common spam filters doing a good
job identifying and blocking Dridex spam campaigns that are being sent to Swiss internet
users every Tuesday – Thursday. However, on Wednesdays February 15, 2017, the game
changed.

1/16

Shortly after noon, we have seen a huge spike in emails being delivered to our spamtraps.
The emails looked like this:

A first glance at the sender email doesn’t reveal it as spam. Even looking at the email’s
header wrongly supports the same: The email has been sent out by SendGrid. SendGrid is
a well-known Email Service Provider (ESP) offering email marketing and transactional email
service. Many big companies and brands rely on ESPs to ensure that their emails are being
2/16

delivered to their customer’s mailboxes smoothly. As many of the fortune 100 companies
are using an ESP, IP addresses associated which such are often whitelisted at common
email servers and DNSBL providers. The reason for this is simple: You can’t blacklist an IP
address associated with an ESP as much as you can’t blacklist IP addresses associated
with Google or Outlook.com. Otherwise you might end up blocking thousands of legitimate
emails coming from Uber, Spotify, Airbnb and any other brands that are using the ESP’s
infrastructure to send emails.

The Spam Email
The emails we have seen hitting our traps on February 15, 2017 pretended to come from
Swisscom. Swisscom is Switzerland’s biggest telecommunication provider. It is a brand that
is known to every Swiss citizen. The mails claim to be an e-bill (Rechnung), which isn’t
uncommon as Swisscom is indeed sending out e-bills via email. But why would Swisscom
send an e-bill to our spam traps? And why not just one, but rather thousands within just a
couple of minutes? This made us suspicious, so we decided to take a closer look at these
emails. The attackers have prepared the spam emails very well. Below is a screenshot of a
legit e-bill that Swisscom usually sends out to their customers, and the fake one spammed
out by the offenders:

3/16

Fake Swisscom e-bill compared to a real one (click to enlarge)
The emails look very similar, but they aren’t identical. The reason for this is simple: The
spam email on the left side pretends to be an e-bill from Swisscom to an enterprise
customer (SME), while the one on the right side is a legit e-bill sent out by Swisscom to a
home user (SOHO), because we don’t have a legitimate SME type e-bill available. The left
(fake) one pretends to come from sme.contactcenter@bill.swisscom.com, while the right,
legit one has been sent from contact.center@bill.swisscom.com. As the spam emails are
apparently targeting enterprise customers (SME), the invoice total is much higher than what
a home user expects to be billed.
Looking at one of these emails for a second time, it appears that the the diacritical
characters ä/ö/ü, which are very common in German, are completely missing and replaced
by a/o/u. Secondly, the hyperlink “Rechnung einsehen” that the user should click (which
means “review bill”) does not point to a domain name owned by Swisscom, but to
Microsoft’s Sharepoint service. Analyzing all of such emails we got, we were able to collect
the following URLs:

Following these links reveal them to serve a ZIP archive called Rechnung.zip containing a
JavaScript file with the matching name Rechnung.js. So, is Swisscom sending out
JavaScript files to their customers? Not really – we became suspicious.

The JavaScript
Having a look at the JavaScript confirms our suspicion that these emails can’t be legit: The
JavaScript files are highly obfuscated:

After deobfuscation, the purpose of the script becomes clear:

Once executed, the script will download a windows binary from Sharepoint online and
execute it:

docid=0ce03b9fd12d949cf91f56a7d1fbf4b93&authkey=ASOCPusN_QaBSXcCPxEkT9s

The Payload
The JavaScript drops the following windows executable from the said Sharepoint URLs:
Filename: line.registr
MD5 hash: 20e10d0c6828e6df0882c043113285d6
SHA256 hash: e01c0ba8b8e3ad5735bdd15bda5bf449ec9c6167badd7173fca04eb6b41570e2

Doing a quick analysis of the payload reveals the distributed malware as Dridex (version
4.23).
Dridex is using different botnets (botnetid). Each botnet has its own configuration file and is
targeting a specific country or a set of countries. The Dridex payload we have observed in
this campaign could be associated with botnetid 2144, which is known for attacking
customers of financial institutions in Switzerland.

6/16

Once executed, an infected computer is going to call out to six different IP address that all
act as botnet command&control server (C&C) for the Dridex malware. Each of these IP
addresses belongs to a compromised server in the internet and is forwarding the botnet
traffic from Dridex infected machines to a tier-2 infrastructure:
198.167.136.139:443
159.226.92.9:4431
136.243.209.34:443
109.235.76.95:1843
209.20.67.87:5353
194.150.118.25:3101

A Dridex bot will contact any of these IP address and will try to get an updated configuration
from the botnet masters. An updated configuration file will contain a new set of botnet
controllers, a list of financial institutions in Switzerland for which Dridex redirects the traffic
(online fraud), as well as a list of offline payment software (offline fraud).
Dridex also sends out a list of installed software to the botnet C&C. If that list includes
offline payment software or software that could potentially be used to transfer payment
instructions (such as FTP clients), the infected machine (bot) will get flagged and the C&C
might deliver Carbanak. Otherwise, a full-featured version of Dridex is installed.
The Dridex configuration files we received can be downloaded at the links below:

Summary of Infection Chain
The following graphic summarizes the events that lead up to the infection with Dridex and/or
Carbanak:

Detection of Dridex
Dridex infections are hard to detect and to clean, as the malware usually only resides in
memory. Dridex is only written to disk upon shutdown, which it knows about from hooking
Window’s shutdown API calls. We learned about several cases where Dridex infections
were allegedly cleaned up by professional IT services, because they did not find traces of
Dridex on disk or startup entries related to Dridex. We recommend that infected systems
are reimaged (reinstalled), or at least cleaned after booting from a rescue stick.

8/16

A promising way to detect current or former infections of Dridex is to look at the registry.
Dridex stores its configuration in multiple registry keys of the format:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID\
{GUID}\ShellFolder

{GUID} is the textual representation of an id that varies between infected clients. The data is
stored as binary data under a name which is also formatted like a GUID. The following
screenshot shows the registry for an infected system:

A clean system, on the other hand, has fewer (usually one or two) entries that match the
pattern. None of the keys should have a GUID-like name or contain binary data:

Screenshot of the Registry on a clean computer (click to enlarge)
We wrote a small Powershell-Script (dridexregistry.ps1) that checks the registry for potential
Dridex entries. The script also checks the Appdata/Local and Appdata/LocalLow for binaries
that match the pattern of Dridex. As clarified above, these files do not usually exist even on
infected systems.

9/16

Filename: carbanaktargets.ps1
MD5 hash: 04a98c92a8b943ee90b6bda921abe0f0
SHA256: a2b667ccb014ba732e1ad337a582f8aa464b5fa7913ebd8034fe8b6bc6d6009a
Filename: dridexregistry.ps1
MD5 hash: d155bf49b289f14047b97b16d9a2a207
SHA256: 8cdcad2546fd943fabe2e98de33f69ae6e8ea08eca5b5dadfc5f1a7cc90c3c1a

The script exports the registry key. You may send these exports along to incident response
or law enforcement agencies. On an infected system, the output of the script might look as
follows:
PS C:\Users\victim> dridexregistry.ps1
!!! Host is was/is almost certainly infected by Dridex
There are 14 config folders, of which 4 are filled.
Written hkcu:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID to
C:\Users\victim\_out\registry.reg
Found no Dridex binaries
Written Report to C:\Users\victim\_out

We also wrote a PowerShell script (carbanaktargets.ps1) that compares the list of installed
applications against the 360 products that Dridex looks for to determine if it wants to deliver
Carbanak:
PS C:\Users\victim> carbanaktargets.ps1
Your system has 'CuteFTP 9' installed, which could trigger Carbanak
Your system has 'SeaMonkey 2.46 (x86 en-US)' installed, which could trigger Carbanak
Your system has 'StarMoney' installed, which could trigger Carbanak
Your system has 'StarMoney 9.0 ' installed, which could trigger Carbanak
Your system could be the target of Carbanak

Doing Incident Response
As a first reaction to the massive spam campaign, we have contacted SendGrid, kindly
asking them to stop the associated email campaign. In addition, we have asked them to
explain to us from whom they received the authorization to send on behalf of
swisscom.com. We were very surprised not to receive any response from SendGrid for 24
hours. We therefore tried to reach them via a phone call (land line), but this turned out to be
a dead end too (“you have reached us outside business ours”). Another 24 hours passed
without any response from SendGrid, so we decided to reach out to them via Twitter. On
Twitter, we finally managed to get a life sign from SendGrid. Unfortunately, it appears that
SendGrid was having trouble to locate our abuse report.

Five more days passed since we have sent our initial abuse report to SendGrid. As of today,
we are still waiting for official feedback from SendGrid.

Conclusion
Dridex is a sophisticated threat. While it has been around for more than two years, the
detection rate by antivirus software is still quite low compared to other threats. The reason
for this can be found in the local distribution of the malware – in our case, the focus was on
Swiss internet users – and its absence on disk while the computer is running (file-less):
Dridex operates exclusively in the memory when the computer is running. So there is no
way for Antivirus programs to detect Dridex on disk.
We have also learned that Email Services Providers (ESPs) are representing an emerging
risk: Many postmasters, spam filter vendors and DNSBL providers trust email traffic coming
from ESPs, by either completely whitelisting them, or a applying a significant negative score
(which reduces the chances that an email from an ESP is being classified as spam). Botnet
operators know this and are abusing ESP’s infrastructure to send their malspam
campaigns. This way, miscreants are able to bypass common spam filters and deliver their
spam email directly to the victim’s mailbox. The following chart shows the success of
abusing an ESP’s infrastructure by the fraudsters.
The chart below shows the number of user submissions on our phishing reporting platform
antiphishing.ch over the past two months:

12/16

Number of submissions to antiphishing.ch (click to enlarge)
On Feb 15, 2017, we have received over 8 times more submissions from users than we
usually did on average days. This impressively documents how efficient the use of
SendGrid was for the miscreants to send out their emails. We believe that almost all emails
passed spam filters and made it into the recipient’s inbox, resulting in a high infection rate
with Dridex across the Swiss internet.
We believe that it is an ESP’s duty to detect and block such malspam campaigns on their
infrastructure in a timely manner. We therefore recommend to postmasters, spam filter
vendors and DNSBL providers to review their position with regards to ESPs, reevaluating
their assessment and take action against ESPs failing to mitigate abuse from their service
in time and/or ignoring abuse reports from 3rd parties.

Recommendations
Dridex might be more sophisticated than average malware. However, there are still a few
things you can do to protect yourself.
In general:
You can spot many of these spam mails by simply watching out for Umlauts (äöü). If
you receive an email that pretends to be from your bank or telecom provider and that
contains no Umlauts, but rather the plain letters (aou), you should be careful.
Some of the spam mails contain ß instead of ss. Please consider that it is very
unlikely that a native Swiss German speaker is using ß.
13/16

If you are unsure whether the email you have received is legit or not, call the sender
or contact him via email to verify the purpose of the email.
Never execute macros in office documents you have received via email, even when
the sender asks you to do so. Macros may harm your computer!
Use a dedicated computer for ebanking (no matter if you use traditional online
banking or an offline payment solution) and do nothing else than ebanking on this
computer.

For private users:
Always keep your Antivirus software up to date. If you use a non-free Antivirus, make
sure that your Antivirus is licensed and if not, renew it or switch to a free Antivirus
software to receive full protection. Otherwise the virus protection will expire and will no
longer protect you against new threats.
Don’t rely on your Antivirus software alone – while it is indispensable, Antivirus can’t
protect you from everything and does not free you from being careful.
Regularly make a backup of your data. The backup should be stored offline, i.e. on an
external medium, such as an external hard disk. Make sure that the medium, where
the backup is saved onto, is disconnected from the computer after the backup
procedure is complete. Regularly test your backups.

For enterprises:
For payments or wire transfer issued via ebanking, make use of collective contracts.
By using collective contracts, every wire transfer needs to be signed and
authenticated by a second ebanking contract / login. Ask your bank about the use of
collective ebanking contracts.
If you use a hardware token (e.g. SmartCard, USB-Dongle) for authentication or
transaction signing, remove it from your device while you are not doing ebanking /
payments.

14/16

Block the acceptance of dangerous email attachments on your email gateway. These
include among others:
.js (JavaScript)
.jar (Java)
.bat (batch file)
.exe (Windows executable)
.cpl (Control Panel)
.scr (screen saver)
.com (COM file)
.pif (program information file)
.vbs (Visual Basic Script)
.ps1 (Windows PowerShell)
.wsf (Windows Script File)
.docm (Microsoft Word with macros)
.xlsm (Microsoft Excel with macros)
.pptm (Microsoft PowerPoint with macros)
In addition, all email attachments containing macros (e.g. Word, Excel or PowerPoint
attachments) should be blocked on the email gateway as well.
Make sure that such dangerous email attachments are also blocked if they are sent to
recipients in your company in archive files such as ZIP, RAR or even in encrypted
archive files (e.g. by blocking password-protected ZIP files completely)
You can obtain additional protection against malware for your IT infrastructure by
using the Windows AppLocker. This tool allows you to specify which programs are
allowed to be run on the computers in your company
Block the download of archives (such as ZIP or RAR) that contain JavaScript code on
your web gateway (Web-Proxy)
Evaluate the SPF record (Sender Policy Framework http://www.openspf.org/) for
domain names that intend to send emails to your users. Reject emails whose sender
IP address does not match the sending domains SPF record (inbound mail)
Implement an SPF record for your own domain name(s) to prevent miscreants from
spoofing emails pretending to come from your domain (outbound mail)
Use DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) for in-bound spam filtering (inbound mail)
Sign outgoing emails from your network to the internet with DKIM and DMARC (outbound mail)

Further information and mitigation strategies can be found on our website.
