The operators of the DoppelPaymer Ransomware have launched a site that they will use to
shame victims who do not pay a ransom and to publish any files that were stolen before
computers were encrypted.
A new extortion method started by the Maze Ransomware is to steal files before encrypting
them and then use them as leverage to get victims to pay the ransom.
If a ransom is not paid, then the ransomware operators release the stolen files on a public
'news' site to expose the victim to government fines, lawsuits, and the risk of the attack being
classified as a data breach.
Soon after starting this tactic, other ransomware families including Sodinokibi, Nemty, and
DoppelPaymer have stated that they would begin this practice as well.

DopplePaymer launches public leak site
Today, the operators of the DoppelPaymer Ransomware have followed in Maze's footsteps
and launched a site called 'Dopple Leaks' that will be used to leak files and shame nonpaying victims.

DoppelPaymer is an enterprise-targeting ransomware that compromises a corporate
network, eventually gains access to admin credentials, and then deploys the ransomware on
the network to encrypt all devices. As these attacks encrypt hundreds, if not thousands, of
devices, they tend to have a huge impact on operators and the attackers demand a very
large ransom.
The ransomware operators state they have created this site as a threat to victims that if they
do not pay, their data and names will be leaked by the attackers.

The 'Dopple Leaks' Site
The ransomware operators have told BleepingComputer that this new site is in "test mode"
and is currently being used mostly for shaming their victims and to publish a few files that
were stolen from victims.

Pemex information on the DoppelPaymer site
Currently listed on this page are four companies that DoppelPaymer claims to have
encrypted and who did not pay the ransom.
Other than Pemex, BleepingComputer will only share descriptions of the other listed
companies and the demanded ransoms that were shared with us by the DoppelPaymer
operators.
A merchant account company based out of USA with a ransom amount of 15 bitcoins
(~$150K).
A French cloud hosting and enterprise telecommunications company with a ransom of
35 bitcoins (~$330K)
A logistics & supply chain company based out of South Africa was encrypted on
January 20th, 2020 with a ransom amount of 50 bitcoins (~$500K).
Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex was attacked by DoppelPaymer on
November 10th, 2019. The attackers demanded 568 bitcoins ($4.9 million at the
time) for a decryptor.
Of all the sites, DoppelPaymer told us that they only stole a large amount of "still unsorted"
files from Pemex.
For the other three companies, they only stole a few files because there was "nothing
interesting" or because "it was not our goal".

They stated that they do plan on performing more data exfiltration now that this site has been
created.

Treat ransomware attacks like data breaches!
BleepingComputer has repeatedly stated that ransomware attacks have to be treated like
data breaches.
For years, it is has been a well-known secret that ransomware attackers are looking through
and stealing victim's files before encrypting computers and then threatening to release them.
It was not until recently, though, that ransomware operators have followed through with their
threats.
Now that they are doing so and more ransomware operators are getting on board,
companies need to be transparent about the data theft and treat these attacks like data
breaches.
This is because it is not only corporate data being stolen, but also vendor and client data and
the personal information of employees.
Transparency is more important now than ever and hiding these attacks is putting their
employees at long-term risk as their data is exposed to identity theft and fraud.
