Introduction
As I have previously described in the article about hunting for geopolitical tensions, the time
has come to provide you a small overview of some interesting cyber operations observed
and shared by security researchers via Twitter during May 2021. In this monthly overview, I
will briefly describe the geopolitical tension between states and the reported cyber
campaigns by the alleged nation-states by sharing actionable indicators of compromise
(IOC’s). In this month’s overview, IOC’s from nation-state threat actors were selected that
originate from Palestine, India, and Pakistan, by basically searching for the keywords “apt“

2/6

and “c2:” over the collected Twitter data from May 2021. The reported IOC’s have not been
examined yet and are therefore weakly anchored with evidence. But let’s explore the Twitter
threat intelligence a bit further.

Middle East

Figure 1: Israel and its direct neighbors
At the beginning of May 2021, escalations between Israel and Palestine (Hamas) resulted in
more than 3,440 rockets were fired towards Israeli cities. The dispute resulted in multiple
casualties on both sides. The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) reported that it also disrupted
Hamas cyber capabilities. As every physical dispute also has its cyber counterpart, the
following campaign was observed by the alleged Palestinian threat actor dubbed APT-C-23
or Desert Viper by Kaspersky.

India

Figure 2: India and China clash at the border June 15, 2020 (graphic NYT)
Since last year the geopolitical border escalations between India and China resulted in high
tensions with many trade issues and banning certain Chinese apps in India. As India is also
a growing power in the Asia-Pacific region, they have also matured their cyber operations in
the past years. The following nation-state cyber actor groups are alleged to be Indian and
have been detected by security researchers in May 2021.

Sidewinder APT group
The Sidewinder APT group has been observed since 2012 and targets mainly military
targets.

Bitter APT Group
The Bitter APT group leveraged a zero-day exploit this year and targeted China, Pakistan,
and Saudi Arabia in different market sectors.

Pakistan

Figure 3: Pakistan and its neighbors (graphic courtesy Publicintelligence)
Pakistan and India have many geopolitical issues together, many also originating from the
disputed region of Kashmir or the known Mumbai terrorist attack from 2008. From a cyber
perspective, the alleged nation-state actor that belongs to Pakistan is dubbed Transparent
Tribe or APT36. The group has been observed in campaigns against Indian diplomatic and
5/6

military resources. Cisco’s Talos threat intelligence unit also shared an in-depth analysis of
the TransParentTribe group in May. They shared that the group leveraged a new malware
capability called ObligueRat, besides the already known CrimsonRat malware.
For example, in May 2021, the following campaigns were shared on Twitter.

Conclusion
Twitter seems a valuable source leveraged by security researchers to share threat
intelligence on ongoing nation-state operations. In May 2021, many potential campaigns
from different nation-state actors were reported on Twitter by security researchers or threat
hunters in areas with geopolitical tensions. A brief overview of some of these actors for May
was outlined. Further research needs to be conducted if these IOCs can indeed be anchored
to these aforementioned nation-states and understand more about their operations and
victims. In the next article, I will further assess one or two potential interesting malware
samples covered in this article to determine if tracking for such an actor can be improved or
to gain a better understanding of their operations. Until next time and sharing is caring!
