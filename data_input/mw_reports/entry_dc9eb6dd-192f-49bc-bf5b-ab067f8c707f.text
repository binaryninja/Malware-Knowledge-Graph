Trucking and freight logistics company Forward Air has suffered a ransomware attack by a
new ransomware gang that has impacted the company's business operations.
Forward Air is a leading trucking and air freight logistics company based out of Tennessee,
USA. The company generated $1.4 billion in revenue for 2019 and employs over 4,300
people.
Last week, FreightWaves reported that Forward Air suffered a cyberattack that forced them
to take their systems offline to prevent the attack's spread. Forward Air later confirmed this
attack in a statement to BleepingComputer.
"On December 15, Forward Air detected an IT security incident that impacted the
functionality of certain computer systems. Per our information security protocols, we
immediately took our systems offline, notified law enforcement and engaged several third-

1/5

party experts to assist us in conducting an internal investigation. Our IT team is working
diligently to restore the affected systems and services and bring them back online as soon
as possible," Forward Air shared in a statement to BleepingComputer.
According to FreightWaves, the attack has led to business disruption as the paperwork
required to release freight from customs was stored on the shutdown systems and is not
available.
At this time, Forward Air's website is down and just displays a message about the "IT
security incident" and that the site is down while they restore affected systems.

New Hades ransomware operation is responsible.
Sources have told BleepingComputer today that Forward Air suffered a cyberattack by a
new ransomware operation known as Hades.
Update 12/21/20 6:37 PM EST: After we published our story, Forward Air filed a Form 8-K
with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing that they suffered a ransomware
attack.
"On December 15, 2020, Forward Air Corporation (the “Company”) detected a ransomware
incident impacting its operational and information technology systems, which has caused
service delays for many of its customers. Promptly upon its detection of the incident, the

2/5

Company initiated response protocols, launched an investigation and engaged the services
of cybersecurity and forensics professionals. The Company has also engaged with the
appropriate law enforcement authorities," the Form 8-K states.
The Hades ransomware gang behind this attack began operating about a week ago in
human-operated attacks against the enterprise.
When encrypting a victim, it will create a ransom note named 'HOW-TO-DECRYPT[extension].txt' that resembles notes used by the REvil ransomware group, as can be seen
below.

Enclosed in the ransom notes is a Tor site URL that is unique to each victim. This URL
brings you to a Tor site containing information about the attack and a Tox messenger
address that victims can use to contact the attackers, which is the same for all victims.

When we reached out via Tox to the ransomware actors, they were unwilling to provide any
information about their attacks. They did, though, share a Twitter account whose name
indicates they will use it to leak files stolen during attacks.
It is not known how much money is demanded to recover files, and a sample of the
ransomware has not been found.
