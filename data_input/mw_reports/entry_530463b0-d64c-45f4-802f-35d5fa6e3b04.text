XRAT Malware Tied to "Xsser/MRAT" Surveillance
blog.lookout.com/xrat-mobile-threat

Lookout researchers have identified a mobile trojan called xRAT with extensive data
collection functionality and the ability to remotely run a suicide function to avoid detection.
The malware is associated with the high-profile Xsser / mRAT malware, which made
headlines after targeting both iOS and Android devices of pro-democracy Hong Kong
activists in late 2014.
Lookout continues to regularly acquire new Android-variant samples of mRAT from multiple
sources, and we have seen detections that show it has been live on Android devices in
recent months. The frequency with which these samples are being deployed in the wild
suggests that this family is still under continual development and actively used in various
campaigns.
Lookout identified xRAT due to a combination of suspicious capabilities it uses, such as
dynamically loading additional code, executing native libraries, using specific ciphers, and
accessing sensitive user information. Samples from both mRAT and xRAT families have an
almost identical code structure, make use of the same decryption key, share certain
heuristics and naming conventions, and interestingly contain anti-debugging techniques that
cause the a frequently-used malware researcher tool, the dex2jar decompiler, to crash.
These many similarities strongly suggest that mRAT and xRAT have been developed by the
same threat actor.

The command and control servers for xRAT are also linked to Windows malware, indicating
that the malicious actors behind this threat are conducting multi-platform attacks against the
PCs and mobile devices of targeted groups.

What it does
The discovery of xRAT and continued improvements to both xRAT and mRAT clearly
demonstrate that threat actors are capable of deploying sophisticated tools to retrieve
intelligence from mobile endpoints. Like mRAT, xRAT supports an impressive set of
capabilities that include flexible reconnaissance and information gathering, detection
evasion, specific checks for antivirus, app and file deletion functionality, and other
functionality listed below. It also searches for data belonging to popular communications
apps like QQ and WeChat. The threat actors themselves are able to remotely control much
of its functionality in real time (e.g., which files to retrieve and what the settings of its
automatic file retrieval module should be).
Listed below are the types of data gathered by xRAT and features that enable it to perform
reconnaissance, run remote code, and exfiltrate data from Android devices:
Browser history
Device metadata (such as model, manufacturer, SIM number, and device ID)
Text messages
Contacts
Call logs
Data from QQ and WeChat
Wifi access points a device has connected to and the associated passwords
Email database and any email account username / passwords
Device geolocation
Installed apps, identifying both user and system applications
SIM Card information
Provide a remote attacker with a shell
Download attacker specified files and save them to specified locations
Delete attacker specified files or recursively delete specified directories
Enable airplane mode
List all files and directories on external storage
List the contents of attacker specified directories
Automatically retrieve files that are of an attacker specified type that are between a
minimum and maximum size
Search external storage for a file with a specific MD5 hash and, if identified, retrieve it
Upload attacker specified files to C2 infrastructure
Make a call out to an attacker specified number
Record audio and write it directly to an already established command and control
network socket

Executes attacker specified command as the root user
Instructs an infected device to repeatedly download, and then delete, large files exhausting a user's mobile data.

xRAT runs a suicide function to avoid detection
xRAT also contains suicide functionality. When triggered, xRAT will clean out its installation
directory before issuing a package manager command to uninstall itself. The developers
behind xRAT created an alert system, flagging to the malware operator if any of the following
antivirus applications are present on a compromised device.

Our analysis found xRAT contains a robust file deletion module, capable of removing large
portions of a device or attacker-specified files. xRAT can be remotely instructed to perform
the following deletion operations:
Remove images from certain directories on the SDCard
Remove audio files from certain directories on the SDCard
Wipe a device, removing large portions; including all files from the SDCard, all apps
and data that exists under the path /data/data/, and all system apps installed under the
path /system/app/.
Remove specific input method editors (IME). This includes
com.htc.android.htcime,
HTC_IME.apk, com.samsung.inputmethod,
SamsungChineseIME.apk,
com.tencent.qqpinyin,
com.sohu.inputmethod.sogou,
com.iflytek.inputmethod,
com.google.android.inputmethod.pinyin, com.tencent.qqpinyin-1.apk,
com.sohu.inputmethod.sogou-1.apk,
com.google.android.inputmethod.pinyin-1.app,
com.iflytek.inputmethod-1.apk, and
other generic instances of IME apps.
Removes messaging applications from a compromised device. This includes
com.tencent.mm,
3/14

im.yixin, com.tencent.mobileqq,
com.whatsapp, and
other messaging applications that may have a similar package name.
These features further highlight the considerable amount of control xRAT operators have
over a compromised phone, allowing it to evade detection by covering its tracks and deleting
entire sections of a device.

Command and control infrastructure
The majority of command and control servers used by xRAT in the past have been based in
China with some appearing in Hong Kong. After analyzing recently acquired samples, we
further identified attacker infrastructure on the East Coast of the United States. This may
indicate an expansion in deployment from the actor behind this family as they've previously
used servers geographically close to regions where their tooling is being deployed.

4/14

Interestingly, the adversary infrastructure has Windows malware associated to it. One
particular malicious executable is named MyExam, indicating that the actors behind this
family may be continuing to target students, similar to how attackers used mRAT during the
protests in 2014.

Data compromise via xRAT highlights valuable data on mobile
devices
xRAT appears to specifically target political groups, but it's also a good example of how
much data can be compromised via a mobile device.
Enterprises must be prepared for these types of threats that compromise contacts,
messaging app conversations, email, Wi-Fi passwords, SIM card information, audio, and text
messages. Data compromise via mobile presents a significant risk to company-confidential
data, and can risk an enterprise's compliance standing, potentially resulting in hefty fines.
This is particularly concerning for businesses who will be subject to GDPR come May 2018,
which demands enterprises protect personal information for anyone it interacts with or sends
to the European Union. Enterprises should invest in a mobile threat detection solution to

6/14

complement EMM/MDM technologies, providing invaluable visibility into threats and risks to
enterprise data via mobile devices.
Lookout is continuing to investigate the actor behind xRAT, its supporting infrastructure, and
the evolving capabilities of the surveillanceware itself.
