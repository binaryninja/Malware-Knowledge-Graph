White Paper

Revealed: Operation Shady RAT
By Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President, Threat Research, McAfee

An investigation of targeted intrusions into
more than 70 global companies, governments,
and non-profit organizations during the last
five years

Version 1.1

White Paper

Revealed: Operation Shady RAT

For the last few years, especially since the public revelation of Operation Aurora, the targeted successful
intrusion into Google and two dozen other companies, I have often been asked by our worldwide
customers if they should worry about such sophisticated penetrations themselves or if that is a concern
only for government agencies, defense contractors, and perhaps Google. My answer in almost all cases
has been unequivocal: absolutely.
Having investigated intrusions such as Operation Aurora and NightDragon (the systemic long-term
compromise of Western oil and gas industry), as well as numerous others that have not been disclosed
publicly, I am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and
valuable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly), with the great
majority of the victims rarely discovering the intrusion or its impact. In fact, I divide the entire set of
Fortune Global 2,000 firms into two categories: those that know they’ve been compromised and those
that don’t yet know.
Lately, with the rash of revelations about attacks on organizations such as RSA, Lockheed Martin,
Sony, PBS, and others, I have been asked by surprised reporters and customers whether the rate
of intrusions is increasing and if it is a new phenomenon. I find the question ironic because these
types of exploitations have occurred relentlessly for at least a half decade, and the majority of the
recent disclosures in the last six months have, in fact, been a result of relatively unsophisticated and
opportunistic exploitations for the sake of notoriety by loosely organized political hacktivist groups
such as Anonymous and Lulzsec. On the other hand, the targeted compromises we are focused
on — known as advanced persistent threats (APTs) — are much more insidious and occur largely without
public disclosures. They present a far greater threat to companies and governments, as the adversary
is tenaciously persistent in achieving their objectives. The key to these intrusions is that the adversary is
motivated by a massive hunger for secrets and intellectual property; this is different from the immediate
financial gratification that drives much of cybercrime, another serious but more manageable threat.
What we have witnessed over the past five to six years has been nothing short of a historically
unprecedented transfer of wealth — closely guarded national secrets (including those from classified
government networks), source code, bug databases, email archives, negotiation plans and exploration
details for new oil and gas field auctions, document stores, legal contracts, supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) configurations, design schematics, and much more has “fallen off the truck”
of numerous, mostly Western companies and disappeared in the ever-growing electronic archives of
dogged adversaries.

What is happening to all this data — by now reaching petabytes as a whole — is still largely an open
question. However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor
at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team’s playbook), the loss represents a massive
economic threat not just to individual companies and industries but to entire countries that face the
prospect of decreased economic growth in a suddenly more competitive landscape and the loss of
jobs in industries that lose out to unscrupulous competitors in another part of the world. And let’s not
forget the national security impact of the loss of sensitive intelligence or defense information.
Yet, the public (and often the industry) understanding of this significant national security threat is
largely minimal due to the very limited number of voluntary disclosures by victims of intrusion activity
compared to the actual number of compromises that take place. With the goal of raising the level
of public awareness today, we are publishing the most comprehensive analysis ever revealed of victim
profiles from a five-year targeted operation by one specific actor — “Operation Shady RAT,” as I have
named it at McAfee (RAT is a common acronym in the industry that stands for remote access tool).
This is not a new attack, and the vast majority of the victims have long since remediated these specific
infections (although whether most realized the seriousness of the intrusion or simply cleaned up the
infected machine without further analysis into the data loss is an open question). McAfee has detected
the malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic
BackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may
recognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel
to the infected machine).
McAfee has gained access to one specific command and control (C&C) server used by the intruders.
We have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log
collection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time, but that
is the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were
standard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit
is sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit, when opened,
on an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute
and initiate a backdoor communication channel to the C&C web server and interpret the instructions
encoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code. This will be quickly followed by
live intruders jumping on to the infected machine and proceeding to quickly escalate privileges and
move laterally within the organization to establish new persistent footholds via additional compromised
machines running implant malware, as well as targeting for quick exfiltration the key data they came for.
After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim
organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from
explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names
is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization,
but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they
are the United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national
Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.

Revealed: Operation Shady RAT

The interest in the information held at the Asian and Western national Olympic Committees, as well
as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency in the lead-up and
immediate follow-up to the 2008 Olympics was particularly intriguing and potentially pointed a finger
at a state actor behind the intrusions, because there is likely no commercial benefit to be earned from
such hacks. The presence of political non-profits, such as a private western organization focused on
promotion of democracy around the globe or a US national security think tank is also quite illuminating.
Hacking the United Nations or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat is also not
likely a motivation of a group interested only in economic gains.
Another fascinating aspect that the logs have revealed to us is the changing tasking orders of the
perpetrators as the years have gone by. In 2006, the year that the logs begin, we saw only eight
intrusions: two on South Korean steel and construction companies and one each on a Department
of Energy Research Laboratory, a US real estate firm, international trade organizations of Asian and
Western nations and the ASEAN Secretariat. (That last intrusion began in October, a month prior to the
organization’s annual summit in Singapore, and continued for another 10 months.) In 2007, the pace
of activity jumped by a whopping 260 percent to a total of 29 victim organizations. That year we began
to see new compromises of no fewer than four US defense contractors, Vietnam’s government-owned
technology company, US federal government agency, several US state and county governments, and
one computer network security company. The compromises of the Olympic Committees of two nations
in Asia and one Western country began that year as well. In 2008, the count went up further to 36
victims, including the United Nations and the World Anti-Doping Agency, and to 38 in 2009. Then the
number of intrusions fell to 17 in 2010 and to 9 in 2011, likely due to the widespread availability of the
countermeasures for the specific intrusion indicators used by this specific actor. These measures caused
the perpetrator to adapt and increasingly employ a new set of implant families and C&C infrastructure
(causing activity to disappear from the logs we analyzed). Even news media was not immune to the
targeting, with one major US news organization compromised at its New York headquarters and Hong
Kong bureau for more than 21 months.
The shortest time that an organization remained compromised was less than a single month; nine
share that honor: International Olympic Committee (IOC), Vietnam’s government-owned technology
company, a trade organization of a nation in Asia, one Canadian government agency, one US defense
contractor, one US general government contractor, one US state and one county government, and
a US accounting firm. I must, however, caution that this may not necessarily be an indication of the
rapid reaction of information security teams in those organizations, but perhaps merely evidence that
the actor was interested only in a quick smash and grab operation that did not require a persistent
compromise of the victim. The longest compromise was recorded at an Olympic Committee of a nation
in Asia; it lasted on and off for 28 months, finally terminating in January 2010.

Below are the complete timelines for each year of intrusion activity. It could be an interesting exercise to
map some of these specific compromises to various geopolitical events that occurred around these times.
(The gaps in the timelines for continuous infections aimed at specific victims may not necessarily be an
indication of a successful cleanup before a new reinfection, but rather an artifact of our log collection
process that did not mark every activity that occurred on the adversary’s infrastructure, potentially
leading to these gaps in the data)

Although Shady RAT’s scope and duration may shock those who have not been as intimately involved in
the investigations into these targeted espionage operations as we have been, I would like to caution you
that what I have described here has been one specific operation conducted by a single actor/group. We
know of many other successful targeted intrusions (not counting cybercrime-related ones) that we are
called in to investigate almost weekly, which impact other companies and industries. This is a problem
of massive scale that affects nearly every industry and sector of the economies of numerous countries,
and the only organizations that are exempt from this threat are those that don’t have anything valuable
or interesting worth stealing.

Update: As we’ve worked further with the Korean Government on this investigation, we have come
to a conclusion that a Korean Government agency was most likely not a victim of these intrusions.
We are still working to determine the identity of the victim organization
