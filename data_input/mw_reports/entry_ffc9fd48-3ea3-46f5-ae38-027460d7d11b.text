Executive Summary
Spook Ransomware is an emerging player first seen in late September 2021
The operators publish details of all victims regardless of whether they pay or not
Targets range across several industries with an emphasis on manufacturing
Analysis shows a significant degree of code sharing between Spook and the
Prometheus and Thanos ransomware families

Overview
Spook ransomware emerged onto the scene in late September 2021 and follows the multipronged extortion model that is all too common these days. Victims are hit with the threat of
data destruction as well as public data leakage and the associated fallout. In this report, we
explore how the malware shares certain similarities with earlier ransomware families, and
describe its main encryption and execution behaviour.

Spook and Prometheus
1/13

There is some indication that Spook is either linked to, or derived from, Prometheus
ransomware. Prometheus is itself an evolution of Thanos ransomware. However, it is
important to note that since Thanos ransomware had a builder which was leaked, any real
attempts at attribution based solely on the malware’s code is somewhat futile. Even so, there
are a few notable similarities between Spook, Prometheus, and ultimately Thanos.
The .NET binary in the following sample, first seen in VirusTotal on 02 October, provides a
glimpse into some of these similarities, with artifacts from the Thanos builder also apparent.

Shared code block with Thanos

Our analysis suggests that there is an overlap of between 29-50% of shared code between
Spook and Prometheus. Some of this overlap is related to construction of the ransom notes
and key identifiers.

Ransom note similarity example (Prometheus vs Spook)
In addition to shared code artifacts, there are similarities with regards to the layout and
structure of the Spook and Prometheus payment portals.
Below are the similarities between the leak data URLs hosted by both the groups

Offline Encryption and Process Manipulation
Spook, mirroring the manifestos of others, boasts “very strong (AES) encryption” along with
the threat of leaking victim data to the public. The malware has the ability to encrypt target
machines without requiring internet connectivity. Encryption of a full disk can occur within just
a few minutes, at which point the ransom note is displayed on the desktop
( RESTORE_FILES_INFO.HTA ) along with numerous other system notifications.
The malware also makes a number of changes to ensure that the ransom notifications are
displayed prominently after reboot (via Start Menu lnk, Reg).
WinLogon is modified (via registry) to display the Ransom Note text upon login:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
Str Value: LegalNoticeCaption/Text

3/13

Registry Modifications for Persistence
Ransom notes are also displayed upon login via a Shortcut placed in the Startup directory

Startup Folder Shortcut
In addition, Spook will attempt to terminate processes and stop services of anything that may
inhibit the encryption process.
Here again there is overlap between Spook, Prometheus, and Thanos with regards to
process discovery and manipulation, especially with regards to checking for and killing the
Raccine anti-ransomware process that some organizations deploy in an effort to protect
shadow copies.
TASKILL.EXE is used to force the termination of the following processes if found:

The Raccine product is specifically targeted with regards to disabling the products’ UI
components and update features. These are carried out via basic OS commands such as
reg.exe and schtasks.exe .

6/13

taskkill.exe /F /IM RaccineSettings.exe
reg.exe (CLI interpreter) delete
"HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "Raccine Tray" /F
reg.exe (CLI interpreter) delete HKCU\Software\Raccine /F
schtasks.exe (CLI interpreter) /DELETE /TN "Raccine Rules Updater" /F

In addition, sc.exe is used to disable specific services and components:
sc.exe config Dnscache start= auto
sc.exe config SQLTELEMETRY start= disabled
sc.exe config FDResPub start= auto
sc.exe config SSDPSRV start= auto
sc.exe config SQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2 start= disabled
sc.exe config SstpSvc start= disabled
sc.exe config upnphost start= auto
sc.exe config SQLWriter start= disabled

With various processes out of the way and the system in an optimal state for encryption, the
malware proceeds to enumerate local files and folders, along with accessible network
resources.
Given the Thanos pedigree, specifics around encryption can vary. The samples analyzed
employ a random string at runtime as the passphrase for file encryption (AES). The string is
subsequently encrypted with the attacker’s public key and added into the generated ransom
note(s). Recovery of encrypted data is, therefore, not possible without the corresponding
private key.

Ransom Payment and Victimology
Upon infection, victims are instructed to proceed to Spook’s TOR-based payment portal.

7/13

Spook Ransom Demand
At the payment portal, the victim is able to interact with the attackers via chat to negotiate
payment.

8/13

Spook Payment Portal
Spook has been leveraging attacks against high-value targets across the globe, with little to
no discretion with regards to industry. Looking at the current cross-section of victims posted
on the group’s web site, however, the majority are in the manufacturing sector.
The public blog went live in early October 2021. At the time of writing, there are 17 victims
posted on the Spook site.

9/13

Some of the victims named on the Spook blog site
Spook actually lists all attacked companies, regardless of whether or not they pay the
ransom demand. Those victims that pay have their entry updated to indicate that the
company’s data is ‘not for sale’. Those that have not paid are listed as having data that is
“For Sale”, while some victim entries, presumably the most recent or those that are in the
process of negotiating, are listed as “Company Decides”.

10/13

Conclusion
As these attacks continue to escalate and become more egregious, the need for true attack
prevention is all the more critical. Spook’s tactic of public outing victims even if they pay
threatens reputational harm to any compromised company, even if they follow the attackers’
payment demands.
This only continues to illustrate the importance of preventing attacks in the first place.
Ransomware operators have moved beyond worrying about companies detecting after-thefact and attempting to recover encrypted data.
