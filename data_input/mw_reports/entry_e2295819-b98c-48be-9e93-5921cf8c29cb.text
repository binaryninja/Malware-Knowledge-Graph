100 more behind
cockroaches?
or how to hunt IoCs with OSINT

Hiroaki Ogawa & Manabu Niseki

Before Starting
●

English version is available for non-native Japanese folks :D

“For every cockroach you see there
are 100 more behind the walls”

Does it apply to cyber threats?

YES

We have to install traps!

Tracking Fingerprints
●

Attackers are good friends with bad habits.
○
○
○
○

●

Reusing infrastructures
Reusing components
Reusing SSL certificates
Reusing SSH host keys

Reusing something increases a possibility of tracking.
○
○

Let’s say it's a fingerprint of an attacker.
You can track him down based on his fingerprint.

Domain Fuzzing

Domain Fuzzing
●

Techniques to find typosquatting domains.
○
○
○

●

Converting 1 to 2 or q. (See your QWERTY keyboard)
Converting a to à, á, â, ã, ä, å, ɑ, ạ, ǎ, ă, ȧ or ą.
Converting a vowel(a, e, i, o or u) to another vowel.
■ e.g. example.com
● axample.com, ixample.com, oxample.com, uxample.com, ...
○ etc.
Domain fuzzing is useful for finding similar domains.
