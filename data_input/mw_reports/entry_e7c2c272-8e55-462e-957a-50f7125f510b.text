DoppelPaymer Ransomware Attacks on
Critical Infrastructure Impact Critical Services
Summary
Since late August 2019, unidentified actors have used DoppelPaymer
ransomware to encrypt data from victims within critical industries
worldwide such as healthcare, emergency services, and education,
interrupting citizens’ access to services. Since its emergence in June
2019, DoppelPaymer ransomware has infected a variety of industries
and targets, with actors routinely demanding six- and seven-figure
ransoms in Bitcoin (BTC). Prior to infecting systems with ransomware,
the actors’ exfiltrate data to use in extortion schemes and have made
follow-on telephone calls to victims to further pressure them to make
ransom payments.

Threat Details
DoppelPaymer ransomware attacks since June 2019 have negatively
impacted the provision of healthcare, emergency, and education
services to citizens worldwide.

Healthcare
In September 2020, a DoppelPaymer attack against an identified hospital in Germany left emergency
service personnel unable to communicate with the hospital. At least one individual requiring
emergency services was re-routed to a hospital 20 miles away. This individual later died, though
German authorities ultimately did not hold the ransomware actors responsible because the German
authorities felt the individual’s health was poor and the patient likely would have died even if they had
not been re-routed. After German authorities contacted the actors through the provided
communication accounts, the actors withdrew the extortion attempt and provided a digital decryption
key upon learning patients’ lives were endangered, according to open source reporting about the
German investigation.
In July 2019, DoppelPaymer actors infected 13 out of 380 servers used by an identified US medical
center with ransomware. The actors demanded a 50 bitcoin ransom, which, at the time of infection,
was worth approximately $600,000. The medical center required several weeks to restore their
systems from offsite backups following the ransomware attack.

Emergency Services
In September 2020, DoppelPaymer actors compromised an identified county’s E911 Center and made
changes, preventing officials from accessing the county’s computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. The
actors reset passwords, removed accounts from the domain administrators group, and created an
admin account called “AD.” In a separate attack on a different county, the actors encrypted servers
used by the county responsible for emergency dispatch, patrol, jail, and payroll departments.
In summer 2020, a DoppelPaymer attack disrupted police and emergency services as well as other
government functions for an identified US city, forcing them to revert to manual operations to
continue essential services to the community. The ransomware was introduced via an Internet
Explorer/Edge browser after an employee viewed a cryptocurrency website. The city’s system was
infected by a Dridex malicious advertisement campaign through the browser’s temporary internet files.
The ransomware was successful in encrypting files stored on the following platforms: Windows 7,
Windows 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, and Server 2016.

Educational Institutions
In September 2020, DoppelPaymer actors targeted an identified community college, resulting in school
officials’ limiting physical access to the campus for several days, impacting in-person classes. The actors
claimed to have exfiltrated files, and provided the victim a TOR site, contact email, and BTC wallet for

contact and payment. During remediation efforts, malicious file “rdel.exe” was found on multiple
machines. If the file were run in the command line with a corresponding CRC32 hash, the “rdel.exe” file
would execute.
In July 2020, DoppelPaymer actors infected networks used by a different identified community college.
Due to the infection, the college restricted network access to all but IT and maintenance staff. The
malware infected servers at three of the college’s campuses but did not infect cloud-based
applications.

Additional Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
Doppelpaymer is one of the first ransomware variants where actors have called the victims to entice
payments. As of February 2020, in multiple instances, DoppelPaymer actors had followed ransomware
infections with calls to the victims to extort payments through intimidation or threatening to release
exfiltrated data. In one case an actor, using a spoofed US-based telephone number while claiming to be
located in North Korea, threatened to leak or sell data from an identified business if the business did
not pay the ransom. During subsequent telephone calls to the same business, the actor threatened to
send an individual to the home of an employee and provided the employee's home address. The actor
also called several of the employee’s relatives.

Recommended Mitigations
The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden
adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the
distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee
that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced
with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders,
employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the
ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office or the FBI’s Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical information they need
to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent future attacks.


Ensure backups are secure and are disconnected from the network at the conclusion of each
backup session.



Audit user accounts regularly, particularly Remote Monitoring and Management accounts that
are publicly accessible. Patch operating systems, software, firmware, and endpoints.



Monitor inbound and outbound network traffic; set alerts for data exfiltration.



Apply two-factor authentication to user login credentials, receiving responses by text rather
than email as actors may be in control of victim email accounts.



Implement least privilege for file, directory, and network share permissions.
