Summary
Everyone likes a great deal, and the closer something gets to free, the more universal its
appeal. In the case of ZingoStealer, the lure of “free” seems to be successfully attracting
both predators and prey. Even those who make their living as a cybercriminal might still try
to keep their costs in check as they look to wreak havoc, but sometimes there are costs to
malware operators for “free” software that aren’t necessarily paid by the victim.
The ZingoStealer information stealer, also known as Ginzo, is malware targeting Windows®
systems that was first discovered in March 2022 being distributed by a Russian group
called the “Haskers Gang.” On March 4, they uploaded a video to YouTube showcasing the
infostealer, announcing that the malware is available for free to its members, distributed via
the Ginzo Telegram channel. An additional variant is available for US$3, which contains a
crypter malware called “ExoCrypt” that encrypts the threat to help the attacker evade
antivirus detection.

The “free” offer seems to be fueling a spike of adoption for the malware. The malware’s
victims, primarily home users, are lured in by the appeal of getting something for nothing –
in their case, it’s the promise of free access to “cracked” versions of popular video games
and software.
ZingoStealer instead steals sensitive user data such as login credentials and
cryptocurrencies. Stolen information is returned to the command-and-control (C2) server
and used for financial gain by the attacker. The malware also packs an additional punch,
delivering malicious payloads to the target machines. For example, in the binary analyzed in
this report, an XMRig cryptocurrency miner was dropped to the machine post-execution.
As it turns out, home users trying to score a free download are not the only ones who might
be getter somewhat more – or less – than they bargained for. Attackers making use of the
free malware could also be getting shortchanged on the “free” offer: As our analysis
reveals, the malware authors maintain access to all data stolen by their clients, and they
could well be profiting from it in addition to, or even in advance of, their clientele. Not so
“free,” after all.

Operating System

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
ZingoStealer is delivered as a highly obfuscated .NET executable. The initial file is
obfuscated using ConfuserEx, an open-source protector tool for .NET files. The file is
decrypted on the fly using the type initializer ".cctor," which causes error messages when
attempting to use automatic deobfuscation tools. This makes readable code more difficult to
obtain, providing the attacker with a means of impeding analysis.

Figure 1 – Obfuscated .NET ZingoStealer executable
When executed, the first thing the malware does is reach out to its C2 server to retrieve a
list of dependencies (also shown in Figure 2). These files are dropped into the directory
where the malware was initially executed.
BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll
DotNetZip.dll
Newtonsoft.json.dll
System.Data.SQLite.dll
SQLite.Interop.dll (x64 and x86)
The files are used by the malware to provide core functionality during the attack.

executed
The malware will then create a folder on the target machine in the directory
“User\AppData\Local\GinzoFolder.” This is where stolen information is stored. As shown in
Figure 3 below, three subdirectories are created within this folder using the following

names:
Browsers
Wallets
Desktop Files

Information Stealing
The malware begins its information heist by taking a screenshot of the victim’s screen
without their knowledge or consent. The screenshot is stored in the
%AppData%Local%GinzoFolder% directory as “Screenshot.Png.”
ZingoStealer also performs a fingerprint of the victim’s system, as seen in Figure 4,
gathering information about the target machine and storing it in a text file called
“system.txt,” in the %GinzoFolder% mentioned above. This information includes the
following:
Windows Version
AV Information
Username
CPU Name
GPU Name
RAM Amount
Public and Local IP Address and location
Screen Resolution

Browsers
ZingoStealer next scans the victim’s device in an effort to collect sensitive information
related to popular web browsers. The information gathered includes login data, cookies,
browser extensions, auto-fill information and any other sensitive data. The malware targets
the following browsers:
Google Chrome
Firefox
Opera and Opera GX

Cryptocurrency
One of the main functions of ZingoStealer is its cryptocurrency stealing ability. The malware
scours the target machine in search of any data associated with the crypto wallet
extensions seen below. A crypto wallet is an application used to both cold-store and retrieve
digital cryptocurrency assets.
Binance Wallet

Guarda

EQUAL Wallet

BitApp Wallet

iWallet

Wombat

Brave Wallet

Coinbase Wallet

MathWallet

MetaMask

Nifty Wallet

Tron Link

Bitcoin

Dash

Litecoin

5/12

ZingoStealer checks browser extensions for wallet credentials for popular cryptocurrency
services, such as Binance and Coinbase.
Additionally, the malware will search the %AppData% directory for any wallet data that is
related to the following cryptocurrencies:
Coinomi

Ethereum

Atomic

Exodus

Jaxx Liberty

Bytecoin

Guarda

Armory

Electrum

Zcash

Exfiltration
The malware will perform exfiltration of all gathered data from the target machine back to
the C2 server. In the case of the binary used in this analysis, it was hosted at
172[.]67[.]129[.]178. All information stored within the directory %GinzoFolder% is
compressed into “ginzoarchive.zip” as seen in Figure 5 and is sent back to the C2 server
via a POST request.

Figure 5 – Data is read from the Ginzo archive file and sent to the C2 server
The malware also stores a datetime value in a file called “ChromeUploadTime.txt” within the
%AppData%Local% directory. This value is used to ensure that the harvested data is not
being sent too frequently to the server. This helps the malware to stay under the radar and
evade detection.

Additional Payloads – XMRig Miner
Another functionality of ZingoStealer, which makes it more dangerous than your average
infostealer, is that it drops additional payloads to the victim’s machine. The payload dropped
by the malware varies depending on how it was set up by the malware operator. For
example, samples have been observed dropping copies of RedLine infostealer (previously
analyzed by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team) onto the target machine. Such
payloads provide additional monetization methods for the ZingoStealer authors and users.
In the instance of the sample analyzed in this report, an injector for the XMRig
cryptocurrency miner was dropped to the system. Cryptocurrency miners are used in
attacks to steal computing power to mine for coins; this process is also known as
cryptojacking.

The file for XMRig was dropped into the %AppData\%Local% directory, as shown in Figure
6. Its filename is generated using a random 6-digit hex number, in this case it was
“346590.exe.”

Figure 6 – Additional payload XMRig dropped to the AppData\Local directory
The file for XMRig is dropped and executed when the initial ZingoStealer file is launched.
ZingoStealer does this by utilizing its file “conhost.exe” to issue the command
"C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe" "C:\Users\
<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\346590.exe."
Once executed, the malware launches PowerShell to issue the base64-encoded command
seen in Figure 7 below.

Figure 7 – PowerShell launched and base64-encoded command executed utilizing the "EncodeCommand" option
Decoding this command reveals its functionality: It is used to create two exclusions in
Windows Defender to avoid being detected.
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath @($env:UserProfile,$env:SystemDrive) -Force
7/12

Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension @('exe','dll') -Force
The XMRig malware attempts to achieve persistence by creating a copy of itself in the
%AppData%Roaming%Chrome% directory under the filename “updater.exe,” as shown in
Figure 8. In addition to this, it creates a scheduled task to ensure that this executable runs
at system startup.

Figure 8 – Miner creates a copy of itself in the \Roaming\Chrome directory under the name
"updater.exe"
The newly created executable also drops a binary into the
%Roaming%Windows%Telemetry% directory called “sihost64.exe.” The XMRig miner is
then injected into the “explorer.exe” process where cryptocurrency mining operations begin.
The miner will periodically send beacon updates back to the C2 server, as seen in Figure 9.

server

Control Panel
The ZingoStealer malware provides a C2 Control panel for its users (the malware
operators) to login and access all harvested data. The panel is hosted at the address
“network[.]nominally[.]ru/admin/login.php.”
It is important to remember that all harvested data is being funneled to the threat actors’
servers. This means that they can also access any stolen data, and it would come as no
surprise if they were using data harvested by those malware operators for their own
monetary gain. After all, the malware is being offered for free!

Conclusion
ZingoStealer contains all the functionality expected from a typical infostealer. What sets it
apart from its peers within the malware landscape is its ability to deliver additional, and
potentially more dangerous, payloads. At present, the malware has been observed
delivering XMRig and RedLine. However, since the malware is available for free and offered
as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), it would come as no surprise to see these additional
payloads continue to vary in coming months.
ZingoStealer has experienced a rapid increase in popularity, considering it was first
discovered in March. At the time of writing this, a retrohunt was carried out on VirusTotal
using the YARA rule attached to this report. The results returned 950+ positive hits for
different binaries of the malware. As this threat’s popularity continues to rise, it will be
interesting to see how the malware operator’s choice of additional malicious payloads
bundled with the malware evolves.
9/12

As the malware seems to be primarily targeting home users, and is being spread by
masquerading as a “cracked” version of popular video games and software, people must be
extra vigilant when visiting websites to download new software. It’s important to only
download from trusted links provided by legitimate vendors, rather than third-party or
“pirate” websites. Also, for those who store cryptocurrencies on their devices, ensure you
have sufficient security measures in place around accessing and storing this information.
