Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a collection of utilities to simplify and automate the
process of gathering forensic traces helpful to identify a potential compromise of Android and
iOS devices.
It has been developed and released by the Amnesty International Security Lab in July 2021
in the context of the Pegasus project along with a technical forensic methodology and
forensic evidence.
Warning: MVT is a forensic research tool intended for technologists and investigators. Using
it requires understanding the basics of forensic analysis and using command-line tools. This
is not intended for end-user self-assessment. If you are concerned with the security of your
device please seek expert assistance.

non-consenting individuals. In order to achieve this, MVT is released under its own license.
