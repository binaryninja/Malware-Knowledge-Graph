The Esile targeted attack campaign targeting various countries in the Southeast Asian region has been
discussed in the media recently. This campaign – which was referred to by other researchers as Lotus
Blossom – is believed to be the work of a nation-state actor due to the nature of the stolen information,
which is more valuable to countries than either private companies or cybercriminals.

The Palo Alto Networks report discussed a targeted attack campaign that has been known to Trend
Micro researchers for some time. We noted in our earlier targeted attack trends report that this
particular campaign – which is known as the Elise/Esile campaign elsewhere – was already in use in

2012. Other researchers have noted that this campaign was active as early as 2007. This campaign
and the tools used are familiar to Trend Micro, and we have developed appropriate solutions for this
threat.
ESILE In A Nutshell
Our detection for the malware family used in the Elise campaign is BKDR_ESILE. Their arrival and
behavior patterns are quite consistent: they arrive via a malicious Office document sent through spearphishing. In many cases, these documents claim to be official government papers to make it more
attractive for users to open these files.

If the document is opened, an exploit is used to execute a dropper (SetElise) on the system. This
dropper is run and tries to establish persistence for the resident component (EliseDLL). It will first try to
create a Windows service to start EliseDLL. Failing that, it will drop a loader (LoadElise) and then add
an autorun registry entry to bring up the loader every time the system boots up.
The diagram below provides an overview of ESILE’s architecture:

The initial command-and-control server information is embedded within the dropper. The
string DA76C979 or DF72YR0V is used as a marker for this information, which is located 40 bytes after
the start of the tag. The file names of the loader and EliseDLL are also contained within the dropper.

Do We Fix It?

One unique attribute of ESILE is that it (poorly) attempts to randomize the properties of the dropped
files. Specifically, the created, last accessed, and last modified dates are all modified by the dropper.
The dates used are randomly generated based on the following algorithm:

Ransomware 101

1. The year for these dates is set to 2007.

2. The day/hour/minute/second/millisecond fields are set using a random number generator (RNG).
The seed for this RNG is set to the year of the dropper’s release – i.e., a 2012 dropper will use
2012 as the seed.

This infographic shows how ransomware
has evolved, how big the problem has
become, and ways to avoid being a
ransomware victim.

Because of the fixed seed, the properties of the dropped files are not actually random, although at first
glance they may appear to be. This may have been done to attempt to confuse security tools and
researchers.

Another unusual property of ESILE malware is that some versions contain strings in their resources
that, in effect, act as fingerprints that identify them as ESILE. These strings are:

As is generally the case with backdoors, ESILE contacts a command-and-control server in order to

uses a URL based on the MAC address of the infected machine’s network interface, as well as the
current time.

A variety of Trend Micro solutions are available to help protect users against this threat. Products with
the ATSE (Advanced Threats Scan Engine), such as Deep Discovery, have heuristic rules which are
capable of detecting attacks delivered via malicious attachments. These are detected
as HEUR_OLEXP.X and EXPL_MSCOMCTL. Endpoint products can also detect the malicious
attachments as TROJ_MDROP variants; the detection for the various ESILE components falls under
