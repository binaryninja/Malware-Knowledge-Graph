Spotted: JobCrypter Ransomware Variant With New
Encryption Routines, Captures Desktop Screenshots

A variant of JobCrypter ransomware was observed using new routines for encryption and
features the ability to send a screenshot of the victim’s desktop to an email address. Aside
from encrypting files twice, the ransom note is unconventionally found in the same encrypted
file. Trend Micro machine learning and behavioral detection technology has proactively
blocked this variant of JobCrypter at the time of discovery.
Routine
The new sample of JobCrypter (detected by Trend Micro as
RANSOM.WIN32.JOBCRYPTER.THOAAGAI) was observed in the wild, reportedly seen on
a suspected compromised website. While the malware's installation and launch procedures
are similar with the 2017 attacks, this sample adds a routine that sends a screenshot of the
victim’s desktop and system information to an email address via SMTP. It also deletes the
registry it created, HKCU\Software\MOI.

email address includes the system’s running processes, volume serial number, machine
name, and the 67-digit encryption/decrypter key.

The wallpaper of the infected machine changes to include the ransom note and a display box
for the cybercriminal’s ransom demand and instructions.

A display box also appears with a text box and a button that reads “Unblock my files,” as well
as a link that says “Don’t have a password? Click here.” When clicked, it opens
%Desktop%\Comment débloquer mes fichiers.txt via notepad. Should the user of the
infected machine have the decrypting key — found in the registry HKCU\Software\MOI
before deletion — the ransomware will use the input text to decrypt %User
Profile%\ntuser.ini.css. If successful, it will continue decrypting all the files with the .css
extension, delete the registries it created including the autostart registry, the files it dropped,
and the malware itself. If not, another message box will appear with the text “Mot de passe
invalide” or “Invalid password”.

Figure 5. The message displayed also says “All your files are encrypted. Don’t have a
password? Click here” and “Unblock my files” button.

This ransomware variant has a few unique routines. Once it finds a file, it encodes all the
file’s content to Base64 and encrypts the encoded content with Triple DES algorithm, and
then encodes the encrypted file again to Base64. It also prepends the ransom note with the
encrypted file instead of dropping another file in the system as most ransomware routines do
before it finally deletes the original file in the drive. All the encrypted files are changed to .css
extension.

Figure 8. The ransom note is found in the encrypted file, and the original file is deleted from
the drive.
The ransom note demands a payment of €1,000 within 24 hours to get the decrypter. The
key is made of 67 digits of random numbers between 0 to 9 – found in the registry and body
of the sent email – but is deleted by the malware itself during encryption of the files. Since
the key used in encrypting the files was in the system prior to deletion, decryption is possible.
Experienced cybersecurity practitioners will notice and know that while the routine is
unconventional, the ransom note always ends in “;” and is prepended before the encrypted
file content, making it possible to recover important data files.

JobCrypter was among the new ransomware families that affected thousands of businesses
and individuals in early 2017. We can expect cybercriminals to continue exploring and
combining new techniques with old malware and tools to infiltrate systems for profit. These
best practices can help defend against this threat:
Regularly download updates and patches from legitimate vendors.
Install a multi-layered security solution that can scan and block malicious URLs.
