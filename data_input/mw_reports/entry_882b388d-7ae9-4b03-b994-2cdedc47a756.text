REPORT

‘Ghostwriter’ Influence Campaign:
Unknown Actors Leverage Website Compromises and
Fabricated Content to Push Narratives Aligned with
Russian Security Interests

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Executive Summary
• Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tied together several information

operations that we assess with moderate confidence comprise part of a
broader influence campaign, ongoing since at least March 2017, aligned
with Russian security interests. The operations have primarily targeted
audiences in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with anti-North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) narratives, often leveraging website compromises or
spoofed email accounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified
correspondence from military officials.
• We have dubbed this campaign “Ghostwriter,” based on its use of inauthentic

personas posing as locals, journalists, and analysts within the target countries
to post articles and op-eds referencing the fabrications as source material to
a core set of third-party websites that publish user-generated content.
• In this report we outline the key tactics, techniques, and procedures we have

observed used in the Ghostwriter campaign and summarize incidents and
personas that we believe are part of the larger activity set. We continue to
investigate multiple other suspected Ghostwriter operations and personas
that are not detailed here.

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Threat Activity Overview
Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tied together several information operations
that we assess with moderate confidence comprise part of a broader influence
campaign, ongoing since at least March 2017, aligned with Russian security
interests. The operations have primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia,
and Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s
(NATO) presence in Eastern Europe, occasionally leveraging other themes such
as anti-U.S. and COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti-NATO
agenda. We have dubbed this campaign “Ghostwriter.”
Many, though not all, of the incidents we suspect to be part of the Ghostwriter
campaign appear to have leveraged website compromises or spoofed email
accounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified news articles,
quotes, correspondence and other documents designed to appear as coming
from military officials and political figures in the target countries. This falsified
content has been referenced as source material in articles and op-eds authored
by at least 14 inauthentic personas posing as locals, journalists, and analysts
within those countries. These articles and op-eds, primarily written in English,
have been consistently published to a core set of third-party websites that
appear to accept user-submitted content, most notably OpEdNews.com,
BalticWord.com, and the pro-Russian site TheDuran.com, among others, as well
as to suspected Ghostwriter-affiliated blogs.
Some of these incidents and personas have received public attention from
researchers, foreign news outlets, or government entities in Lithuania and
Poland, but have not been tied to a broader activity set. Others have received
little attention and remain relatively obscure. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has
independently discovered several Ghostwriter personas and identified additional
incidents involving some of those personas previously exposed. We believe
the assets and operations discussed in this report are for the first time being
collectively tied together and assessed to comprise part of a larger, concerted,
and ongoing influence campaign.

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Who is Conducting This Activity
and Why?
At this time, we do not attribute the Ghostwriter campaign
to a specific actor or group of actors. Instead, we refer to
Ghostwriter as an “activity set,” with various incidents tied
together by overlapping behavioral characteristics and
personas, rather than as an actor or group in itself. Our
moderate confidence assessment therefore corresponds to
the tying of individual incidents, personas, and other assets
to one another, and thus to the broader activity set, based
on their overlapping behavior and interactions. It appears,
based on the limited public information available regarding
the website compromises we have tied to Ghostwriter,
that the actors behind the campaign are relatively wellresourced, either directly possessing traditional cyber
threat capabilities themselves or having ready access to
operational support from others who do. It is plausible
that Ghostwriter operations are conducted by overlapping
actors or groups that are also behind other influence
campaigns or incidents of cyber threat activity.
Promoted Ghostwriter narratives have aligned with
Russian security interests, primarily seeking to foment
distrust of U.S. and NATO troops in Europe by portraying
their presence as aggressive and dangerous to local
populations and to undermine military relations between
NATO members. The narratives have focused heavily on
NATO military exercises in the region, including Saber
Strike 2018, ANAKONDA 2018, DEFENDER-Europe 20, and
Iron Wolf 2019. For example, recent Ghostwriter incidents
have included allegations that U.S. and NATO forces are
contributing to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe. Our
analysis of articles published this year by suspected
Ghostwriter personas on TheDuran.com, one of the thirdparty websites frequently leveraged in the campaign,
identified the most prevalent themes to be the impact
of COVID-19 on U.S. and NATO forces, general attempts
to discredit the U.S. and NATO, and strategic discussion
favoring Russia over other world powers. On several
occasions, news outlets and government agencies in

1

Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland have issued public statements
declaring content and narratives promoted as part of what
we identify as Ghostwriter to be untrue and have labeled
them to be “disinformation” or “fake news.”
On the surface, some aspects of Ghostwriter operations,
notably their occasional use of fabricated official
documents and correspondences, bear resemblance
to aspects of the ongoing suspected Russian influence
campaign referred to as “Secondary Infektion,” which was
first publicly exposed by the Atlantic Council’s Digital
Forensics Research Lab1 and which we have investigated
and reported on extensively. However, we treat Ghostwriter
and Secondary Infektion as two distinct activity sets given
notable differences in observed behaviors and tactics
between the two:
• Many Ghostwriter operations have leveraged

compromised websites, including legitimate news
websites, to publish fabricated content, or used spoofed
email accounts to engage in direct outreach and
dissemination of content to NATO itself and national
organizations and media outlets in the target countries.
We have not, at this time, observed the use of traditional
cyber threat activity in support of Secondary Infektion
operations.
• Multiple Ghostwriter operations have involved the

dissemination of articles and narratives by multi-use
inauthentic personas with developed histories, or single
use personas impersonating real individuals or behind
which at least some effort has been made to make them
appear authentic, on a specific set of core platforms.
By contrast, single-use burner accounts are almost
exclusively used to post Secondary Infektion content
across a variety of blogs, forums, and self-publishing
sites, with little effort put into making the accounts
appear authentic.

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Operations and Tactics
There is no modal Ghostwriter operation, with different
combinations of tactics being employed and the order
and nature of dissemination often changing from incident
to incident (Figure 1). In general, however, the first stage
of a Ghostwriter operation involves the creation of a
falsified narrative and, commonly, accompanying fabricated
“source” documentation such as fabricated quotes
attributed to government officials, altered images, or
falsified official correspondence or other documents such
as the following:
• Fabricated quotes have formed the basis of false

narratives pushed by Ghostwriter. For example, a quote
falsely attributed to the commander of the NATO eFP
Battle Group was used to push a narrative that Canadian
soldiers stationed in Latvia had been diagnosed with
COVID-19, stating “Yes, 21 soldiers have tested positive
for the virus. We have taken the necessary security
measures, but not everyone has the same immunity. All
necessary measures are being taken. The soldiers are
isolated.”2
• Fabricated documents, including falsified official

correspondence, have been used as source material
for Ghostwriter narratives. For example, a fabricated
letter presented as having been authored by NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was disseminated by
Ghostwriter personas to bolster a narrative suggesting
that NATO was planning to withdraw from Lithuania in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.3
Altered images have been used as evidence to support
Ghostwriter narratives. For example, one incident involved
the use of a photoshopped image of a Jewish cemetery
that was purported to have been desecrated by German
soldiers.4

6

One or more dissemination phases then occur, whereby
varying combinations and orders of tactics are used to
spread the false narratives, including placing articles
and any supporting fabricated documentation onto
compromised legitimate websites, using inauthentic
personas to post “news” articles and op-eds on regularly
leveraged third-party sites that appear to accept usersubmitted content, posting articles and content to blog
pages we suspect are directly affiliated with Ghostwriter,
and direct email dissemination of content and articles,
including to legitimate media outlets and government
officials.
• Multiple Ghostwriter operations appear to have

leveraged compromised websites, predominantly those
of news outlets, to post fabricated news articles or
documentation. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has not
independently confirmed these compromises and is
relying on reporting by government entities and media
outlets in the target countries. In some cases, only the
purported victim entity itself has publicly claimed to
have been compromised. However, in many cases we also
located archived copies of Ghostwriter articles posted
to the suspected compromised sites (Table 1). Public
reporting suggests that in at least some of these cases,
the fabricated articles were published using the sites’
content management systems (CMS) after obtaining
user credentials.5 Furthermore, it appears that rather
than creating new CMS entries, the actors may have
replaced existing legitimate articles on the sites with the
fabrications.6

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

-

In September 2019, for example, the local
Lithuanian news site kaunas.kasvyksta.lt was
reportedly compromised, and a false article
published claiming that German soldiers had
desecrated a Jewish Cemetery in Kaunas.7 We
independently observed an archived version of
that article having been posted to the site.8
One of the few non-news site compromises
involved the April 2020 compromise of the
Polish War Studies Academy website, on which
a fabricated letter presented as having been
authored by the Commander of the Academy
effectively called for Polish troops to fight
against “the American Occupation,” a reference
to the NATO exercise DEFENDER-Europe 20.9

• Inauthentic Ghostwriter personas post fabricated news

articles and op-eds that push the falsified narratives and
reference the fabricated source materials. These articles
have primarily been published in English on a small
core of sites that appear to allow for the submission of
user-generated content, most notably OpEdNews.com,
BalticWord.com, and the pro-Russia site TheDuran.com,
as well as occasionally on one of more than a dozen
other websites and platforms we have observed used by
Ghostwriter personas. Such articles also often reference
the articles or materials posted on the compromised
legitimate sites.
-

• On several occasions, Ghostwriter narratives and articles

have been directly disseminated over email, notably to
legitimate news organizations and government officials
in Lithuania and Poland, as well as NATO officials. Our
analysis of public reporting on individual incidents
suggests that in the majority of cases this direct email
outreach has been done using spoofed email addresses
presented as coming from various individuals, including
government and military officials and journalists. For
example, an email presenting as coming from a staffer at
the Lithuanian media outlet delfi.lt was reportedly sent
to various other media outlets in Lithuania and promoted
the narrative that U.S. soldiers had been involved in a
carjacking in that country.11
• Articles promoting Ghostwriter narratives have also been

posted to various blogs and pages on Wix, Blogspot, and
Wordpress that we suspect to be Ghostwriter-controlled.
For example, an article published on WordPress
promoted a false claim that a U.S. Army officer serving in
Lithuania had contracted COVID-19 and then interacted
with the local population.12 13
• In some instances, we have observed further

amplification of fabricated Ghostwriter articles on social
media by suspected inauthentic personas, though this is
not a primary vector of dissemination in the campaign.

For example, an article titled “US official had
no mercy for Polish soldiers!” authored by the
persona “Rod Renny” and posted to TheDuran.
com, directly referenced a falsified interview
posted to several reportedly compromised Polish
media sites.10

Table 1. Summary of fourteen suspected Ghostwriter operations, including core narratives and dissemination methods observed. Asterisks denote suspected, but unreported
potential website compromises. Limited indicators, including the appearance on these sites of Ghostwriter-linked articles at the same time that they were disseminated elsewhere by
Ghostwriter personas, as well as public reporting of previous compromises of these sites that were used to publish falsified articles, lead us to suspect that these sites may have been
compromised as part of the Ghostwriter incident in question. We independently confirmed using website archives and caches that Ghostwriter-linked articles did appear on these
sites at the same time as the broader related Ghostwriter activity, but could not confirm their compromise through third-party reporting.

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Inauthentic Personas
Multiple indicators suggest that at least
14 suspected Ghostwriter personas have
published articles promoting narratives
corresponding with at least 15 suspected
Ghostwriter operations since 2017 (Table
2). We have observed at least six of these
personas leveraged in multiple Ghostwriter
operations. The vast majority of the
personas use either Baltic- or Englishsounding names, some of which are
inconsistent with their supposed identity or
otherwise raise suspicions. Many claim to
be locals, journalists, or editors of the target
countries in biographies they have listed on
sites to which they contribute content.
We have observed indicators of
coordination between some of the
personas. For example, multiple identified
personas have “upvoted” one another’s
articles on TheDuran.com but have not
upvoted any other content on the site. For
instance, “Rod Renny” upvoted articles from
Belit Onay and “jonaskatinelis.” We have
also observed multiple personas publish
articles as part of the same operation(s).
For instance, both Belit Onay and Rod
Renny published falsified articles regarding
the alleged transportation of American
nuclear weapons from Turkey to Poland and
Germany. “Vilius Petkauskas” and “Jonas
Katinelis” both published falsified articles
alleging that NATO was withdrawing its
troops from Lithuania. In late April, “Vairis
Godmanis” and Edgars Palladis published
similar articles that included the same
fabricated quote falsely attributed to a
Canadian military officer alleging that
around 20 Canadian soldiers in Latvia were
diagnosed with COVID-19.

Figure 1. The Rod Renny persona upvoted articles from two other suspected
personas, Belit Onay and jonaskatinelis. Two of the upvoted articles pertain to
recent operations in which fabricated documents were disseminated through
compromised websites.

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Table 2 below lists 14 of the Ghostwriter personas we have identified. As mentioned previously, we have identified
numerous other personas not detailed here that we believe to be Ghostwriter-related and are continuing to investigate.

Table 2.
Fourteen identified Ghostwriter author personas primarily publish on a core set of “news” sites, including opednews.com, balticword.eu,
and theduran.com

REPORT | ‘GHOSTWRITER’ INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN

Outlook and Implications
The Ghostwriter campaign leverages traditional cyber threat activity and
information operations tactics to promote narratives intended to chip away at
NATO’s cohesion and undermine local support for the organization in Lithuania,
Latvia, and Poland. While the operations so far have targeted audiences in
this limited set of countries, we caution that the same tactics employed in the
Ghostwriter campaign can be readily repurposed and used against other target
geographies. Given the established history of cyber threat and information
operations tactics regularly migrating from targeting Eastern Europe to
targeting Western Europe and the U.S., this campaign may warrant special
attention, especially as elections near.
