cube0x0

A sharpen version of CrackMapExec. This tool is made to simplify penetration testing of
networks and to create a swiss army knife that is made for running on Windows which is
often a requirement during insider threat simulation engagements.
Besides scanning for access it can be used to identify vulnerable configurations and exfiltrate
data. The idea for the data exfiltration modules is to execute the least amount of necessary
code on the remote computer. To accomplish this, the tool will download all the secrets to the
loot directory and parse them locally.
You can specify if you want to use Kerberos or NTLM authentication. If you choose Kerberos,
the tool will create a sacrificial token and use Rubeus to import/ask for the ticket. If NTLM is
specified, the tool will use SharpKatz SetThreadToken or LogonUser impersonation.

Can be used to scan for admin access, accessible Smb shares, Smb version and relay
signing.

The beast. It has built-in Amsi bypass, JEA language breakout, JEA function analysis. Can
be used for code execution, scaning for PsRemote access, vulnerable JEA endpoints, and
data exfiltration.

Domain
Currently supports domain password spraying and to create a TGT for the current user that
can be used with the /ticket parameter to get the current context.

For easy or mass in-memory execution of C# assemblies

Kerberos password spraying then scanning for local admin access

This project supports scanning JEA endpoints and will analyze source code of non default
commands and check if the endpoint was not configured for no-language mode.

Discover local admin password reuse with an NT hash.

Mass dump Lsass process with built-in Microsoft signed DLL and saves it to the loot
folder

Executes in all delegation processes sorted by unique by users

Scan for SMB signing and SMBv1

And much more!
Some scenarios with Kerberos will require you to sync your clock with the DC and set the
