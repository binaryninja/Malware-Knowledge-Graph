Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers continually monitor the TrickBot
botnet operated by the GOLD BLACKBURN threat group. A key feature of TrickBot is its
ability to manipulate web sessions by intercepting network traffic before it is rendered by a
victim's browser. TrickBot has targeted hundreds of organizations, mostly financial

institutions, since it began widespread operation in October 2016. In August 2019, the
dynamic webinjects used by TrickBot were augmented to include the following U.S.-based
mobile carriers:
August 5: Verizon Wireless
August 12: T-Mobile
August 19: Sprint

When a victim navigates to the website of one of these organizations, the legitimate server
response is intercepted by TrickBot and proxied through a command and control (C2) server.
This C2 server injects additional HTML and JavaScript into the page, which is then rendered
in the victim's web browser. For all three carriers, injected code causes an additional form
field that requests the user’s PIN code, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.

The injected code shown in Figure 3 activates TrickBot’s record (rcrd) functionality. This
functionality creates an additional HTTP request containing the victim’s username, password,
and PIN that is transmitted to the TrickBot C2 server. These “recordings” are presented to
TrickBot operators as they browse through infected hosts in their web panel.

The targeting of mobile PIN codes by GOLD BLACKBURN, or by affiliated threat actors
using TrickBot, suggests an interest in perpetrating port-out or SIM swap fraud. This fraud
allows an attacker to assume control of a victim’s telephone number, including all inbound
and outbound text and voice communications. The interception of short message service
(SMS)-based authentication tokens or password resets is frequently used during account
takeover (ATO) fraud.
CTU™ researchers recommend that organizations use time-based one-time password
(TOTP) multi-factor authentication (MFA) rather than SMS MFA when feasible. Similarly,
telephone numbers should not be used as password reset options on important accounts.
Enabling a PIN on mobile accounts remains a prudent anti-fraud measure that requires an
attacker to possess an additional piece of information about their intended victim.

To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note
that IP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses may contain malicious content, so
consider the risks before opening them in a browser.
