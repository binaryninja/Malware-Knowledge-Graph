Unknown hackers compromised two NPM repositories that have been used by millions of
people in the past, trying to establish the foundation of a man-in-the-middle attack and
deploying a banking trojan.
We’re used to hearing about hackers compromising networks and apps, or simply deploying
malware through various other methods, but man-in-the-middle attacks might not seem all
that common. Unfortunately, just because they don’t often make the news doesn’t mean
they’re rare. Compromising libraries or apps before they reach consumers leaves few traces
and can take a long time before it’s discovered.
In this case, NPM issued an advisory warning people that a couple of libraries, ‘coa’ and ‘rc’
have been compromised and infected with malware.
“The npm package coa had versions published with malicious code. Users of affected
versions (2.0.3 and above) should downgrade to 2.0.2 as soon as possible and check their
systems for suspicious activity,” stated NPM on GitHub. A similar advisory is available for the
‘rc’ package.
“Any computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully
compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately
from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the
computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the
package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it,” NPM added.

The malware attackers deployed seem to be a DanaBot variant, allowing criminals to capture
and download information from victims’ devices.
Unlike typosquatting attacks, in which criminals create infected libraries with names very
similar to the official ones, the attackers managed to compromise the official repositories and
replace the files. That’s why the NPM team issued a statement on Twitter explaining what
likely happened.
“This morning we detected multiple versions of the “coa” package published with malicious
code due to a compromised account of a maintainer,” said the team. “We quickly removed
the compromised versions […] and the compromised account has been temporarily
disabled.”
They also advised other maintainers to enable multi-factor authentication as soon as
possible, indicating the likely path taken by attackers to compromise the repositories.
