HP WOLF SECURITY THREAT INSIGHTS REPORT

THREAT LANDSCAPE
Welcome to the Q3 2021 edition of the HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report. Here our security experts highlight malware trends
identified by HP Wolf Security from the third quarter of 2021, equipping security teams with the knowledge to combat emerging
threats and improve their security postures.1

NOTABLE THREATS
CVE-2021-40444 MSHTML exploit offers new way for attackers to run malicious code
On 7 September 2021, Microsoft released a bulletin for CVE-2021-40444, a high severity zero-day remote code execution vulnerability
in the MSHTML web browser engine in Windows.2 The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious Microsoft Office files, one
of the top ways threat actors spread malware. Its potential reach and impact are high because attackers do not need to significantly
change their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to use the exploit. In Q3 2021, Office documents and spreadsheets were the
second and third most popular file types used for delivering malware, accounting for 40% of threats isolated by HP Wolf Security.
Unlike documents containing malicious macros that require attackers
to trick users into running unsafe code, exploiting CVE-2021-40444
needs minimal user interaction because it can be triggered by simply
opening a document or previewing it in File Explorer. We expect threat
actors – hacktivist, criminal and nation state – to increasingly use this
exploit to gain initial access to systems because of its operational
advantages over other execution techniques and exploits widely used
today, such as CVE-2017-11882.
Once exploited, an attacker can run arbitrary code on the system,
for example, downloading and installing a backdoor giving them
persistent access. The foothold into the network may then be used to
achieve their objectives, such as stealing valuable data or holding an
enterprise to ransom in a human-operated ransomware attack.
The exploit works by loading an external resource, which causes the
document to run JavaScript code that exploits the vulnerability. In
samples analyzed by the HP Threat Research team, JavaScript was
used to download a cabinet (CAB) archive file from a remote server
containing a dynamic-link library (DLL). A path traversal vulnerability
was then used to run the DLL, with control.exe and rundll32.exe being
the executing processes.

Figure 1 – CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability timeline

Microsoft provided possible mitigations in the bulletin that disclosed the vulnerability, such as disabling ActiveX controls, before
releasing a patch on 14 September 2021. The first documented case of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, however, was
identified on 21 August 2021, leaving a 24-day window of vulnerability.3 The timeline in Figure 1 illustrates how the conventional
way software developers and users respond to vulnerabilities favors attackers because of the time lag between an attacker first
discovering a vulnerability and a user installing a patch.

HP WOLF SECURITY THREAT INSIGHTS REPORT

HP Sure Click’s threat containment technology eliminates the risk window of CVE-2021-40444 because the vulnerable MSHTML
component of Windows is isolated inside a micro-Virtual Machine, protecting the host system from infection.4 This removes the
need for network defenders to rely solely on detections and mitigations, which may be imperfect and become obsolete quickly as
the understanding of the scope of a vulnerability evolves. While patch management remains a critical activity for the security of
any network, threat containment can protect enterprises against unknown vulnerabilities and scenarios where a patch is yet to be
released – as was the case with CVE-2021-40444.

HP Wolf Security stops campaign masquerading as the Ugandan National Social Security Fund
On 31 August 2021, HP Wolf Security protected a user from a malware campaign that impersonated a legitimate quasi-governmental
organization, the Ugandan National Social Security Fund (NSSF). The attackers typosquatted the organization’s domain name by
registering a fake domain that closely resembled the real one.5

Figures 3 & 4 – WHOIS information showing the legitimate NSSF domain (left) and the malicious domain used in the August 2021 campaign (right)

The user received a link to the fake website, where they downloaded a malicious Word document pretending to be a member
statement (Figure 5). The document ran a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro which executed a PowerShell script.
The script first disables PowerShell script block logging to make an investigation of the host more difficult by preventing detailed log
evidence from being recorded.6 Afterwards, the script attempts to evade detection by bypassing the Antimalware Scan Interface
(AMSI) feature in Windows by setting the amsiInitFailed variable to False.7 The script then tries to download and run a second stage
payload, which is RC4 encrypted, using the .Net.WebClient class. This payload, however, was unavailable at the time of execution. To
make the download traffic blend in, the script sets the HTTP User-Agent header to match Internet Explorer 11. The script was almost
identical to the default stager of PowerShell Empire – a command and control (C2) framework that is often used by red teams as well
as cybercriminals. Indeed, the URI and User-Agent values matched PowerShell Empire’s default configuration.8

HP WOLF SECURITY THREAT INSIGHTS REPORT

Attackers use legal threats to spread NetWire RAT to Bulgarian users
In July 2021, HP Sure Click isolated a malicious spam campaign delivering NetWire,
a remote access Trojan (RAT) that targeted users in Bulgaria.9 The attackers
sent emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents purporting to be
civil enforcement claims from a private enforcement agent. The lure documents
contained a message requesting the reader to disable Word’s read-only mode
(Protected View) and to enable macros. Doing so causes a malicious VBA macro to
run, which downloads a NetWire executable to the victim’s %TEMP% directory and
then executes it.

89%

OF THREATS ISOLATED BY HP WOLF
SECURITY WERE DELIVERED BY
EMAIL IN Q3 2021. 11% WERE WEB
DOWNLOADS AND LESS THAN 1%
USED OTHER VECTORS.

Investigation by the HP Threat Research team found that the threat actor most
likely sought to target Bulgarian individuals. The web server hosting the payload
was geofenced so that only IP addresses in Bulgaria could download the malware.
The publisher metadata in the NetWire executable had also been copied from a legitimate Bulgarian software company. Finally, the
email lure was composed in Bulgarian and referenced a Bulgarian private enforcement agent. NetWire is a commercial RAT capable
of controlling a remote system without a user’s knowledge. Its capabilities include keylogging, stealing credentials stored in web
browsers and capturing screenshots.

TrickBot now being delivered via HTA files as well as Office documents
In July 2021, HP Wolf Security telemetry recorded an increase in TrickBot malware being distributed via HTML Application (HTA)
files sent as email attachments.10 Previously, TrickBot distributors preferred to use macros embedded in Office documents as the
initial infection vector. We last saw HTA files being used to distribute TrickBot at the end of 2020, followed by a switch back to Office
documents. The change reduces the user interaction required to infect a system because the recipient only needs to double click the
malicious HTA file to trigger the chain of infection.

HP WOLF SECURITY THREAT INSIGHTS REPORT

If opened, mshta.exe interprets the HTA file and executes an obfuscated VBScript. The script executes a PowerShell command using
cmd.exe, which downloads and runs another PowerShell script from a remote server. The second script downloads TrickBot in the
form of a DLL from another remote server, saves it in the user’s %TEMP% directory and then runs it using rundll32.exe. The Group
Tag (gtag) parameter of the TrickBot sample downloaded by the script in Figure 9 was rob112. After installation, the Trojan determines
the system’s public IP address using an external service, communicates with the botnet’s C2 infrastructure and performs initial
reconnaissance of the environment, before waiting for further commands.

Uptick in email-borne JavaScript malware
In Q3 2021, we detected a rise in JavaScript malware families spread through
email, including Vengeance Justice Worm (Vjw0rm).11 Vjw0rm is a RAT that has
worm-like capabilities, including the ability to spread to removable storage
devices. We often see obfuscated JavaScript malware attached to email as .JS files,
which are sometimes successful at bypassing email gateway scanners. Therefore
we recommend organizations enforce email policies that block attachment file
formats that are commonly abused by malware distributors, such as scripts and
executables.

In one case, VjW0rm was sent as a JS attachment to a Spanish construction
company but was isolated HP Sure Click. The email purported to be a forwarded
quote. When opened, the script decodes and attempts to runs the malware in the
user’s %APPDATA% directory. The malware beacons information about the infected system to a C2 server, storing the data in the
User-Agent and UA-CPU headers of an otherwise empty HTTP POST request. Vjw0rm listens for commands sent by the malware
operator and then runs them on the victim PC. The malware maintains persistence on the system by setting a Run registry key called
B02N3ZE1UL and creating a copy of the script in the Windows start-up folder so that the malware runs each time Windows starts.

Attackers use Microsoft tools and services to deliver GuLoader and Remcos RAT
In August 2021, HP Sure Click isolated a malware campaign that abused Microsoft tools and services to evade detection. The infection
chain began with an HTA file sent to the target by email. The file was minimally obfuscated and used the living off the land binary
bitsadmin.exe to download and run GuLoader malware on the system.12
GuLoader subsequently downloaded and ran Remcos RAT – a commercial RAT – which was hosted on Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud
storage service.13 Hosting malware on legitimate services increases the likelihood that the payload will evade network security controls
that rely on website reputation. The Remcos binary is never written to disk, a defense-evasion technique. Instead, it is executed in
memory, then injected into a newly started legitimate Windows process. Once the malware is installed on the computer, a connection is
established to the operator’s C2 server, through which the attacker gains full access to the infected system.

NOTABLE TRENDS
Discord and legitimate file-sharing services used to host malware
In Q3 2021, we saw more threat actors piggybacking off legitimate services that allow users to upload and share files to host malware.
This benefits attackers because it removes the need to set up or manage their own hosting infrastructure – bought or compromised.
Legitimate websites are also less likely to be blocked by network security controls, increasing the success rate of malicious
downloads. Since attackers only need their malware hosted long enough to be effective, service providers must respond quickly to
abuse reports to stand any chance of disrupting ongoing malware campaigns. Historically, less-resourced attackers tended to host
malware on file-sharing services, but in Q3 we noticed highly capable threat actors, such as those associated with the crimeware
Trojan Dridex, started following suit too. In total, the HP Threat Research team identified 10 malware families hosted on infrastructure
belonging to Discord, an instant messaging service: Dridex, Cobalt Strike, Agent Tesla, RedLine Stealer, njRAT, AsyncRAT, Android
Cerberus, Formbook, Guloader, and Lokibot.

NOTABLE TECHNIQUES
JavaScript Loader dispensing RATs in the wild
In Q3 2021, HP Wolf Security quarantined a JavaScript loader that was used to distribute eight RAT and information stealer malware
families. Analyzing the obfuscated JavaScript code revealed that the malware not only has the ability to download a payload from a
remote server, but also act as a dropper by embedding the payload within the script – removing the need to download the payload
altogether.
The HP Threat Research team performed a retrohunt over Q3 which identified eight malware families distributed using the loader,
almost half of which were STRRAT (Figure 17).15 One the drivers of information stealers and RATs is the value of access to systems and
compromised data. Q1 2021 saw a strong rise in the value of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, thereby incentivizing financiallymotivated threat actors to target cryptocurrency wallets and credentials to online currency exchanges.
