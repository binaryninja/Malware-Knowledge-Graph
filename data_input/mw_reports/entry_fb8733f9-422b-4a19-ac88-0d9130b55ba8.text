During my last investigation (here), I’ve found two RTFs malware documents with the same
techniques of exploitation of CVE-2017–11882:
A file 8.t in %TMP% with Package Ole Object
The same loop of decryption
The same runPE after overwriting in memory EQNEDT32.exe
But the payload is really different. It’s not a version of PlugX but a version of Sisfider studied
by Ncc group. https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-andevents/blogs/2018/june/cve-2017-8570-rtf-and-the-sisfader-rat/
With the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same interactions with
operating system than my last article and the paper of NCC Group.

1/10

Behaviour of malwares
The difference with the version studied by NCC Group is the Package Ole Object. In the
article of NCC Group, the researchers talk about a SCT File and many javascript
manipulations for dropping the RAT on the disk and to start it.
Here, the payload is encrypted in 8.t file
If we analyze EQNEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, we have the same
technics anti emulation with the same value.
In a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah.

Anti emulation tricks

Anti emulation tricks
The verification is calling GetMessage() and the value is stored in EAX in the function
sub_401A60.
3/10

The comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0.

Anti emulation tricks verification
Juste after we found again the loop of decryption for the config.

call to loop of decryption

4/10

Loop of decrypting config
It’s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key.
The mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just after dropping differents
files and a privilege escalation.

5/10

We found the same name of the dll files.

Persistence and loading agent
The malware overwrite the comobject
{9BA05972-F6A8–11CF-A442–00A0C90A8F39} to execute when this com object is called to
make a persistence

6/10

ComObject Adding
All evidences show is the same payload Sisfader RAT.
Threat Intel
The toolset for exploiting the module of equation is the same using of the compromission for
Vietnameses Officials used by Goblin Panda. (APT 1937CN)
If we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a
real good pivot. It makes the link with Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT.
And the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on three IPs:
122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200
Theses addresses can permit to found others domains:
Sd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new IP 1.188.233.201

7/10

Infrastructure
The Ip Address 103.255.45.200 has two domains:
www.36106g.com
36106g.com

Infrastructure
All infrastructure is based at Shanghai.
The victims are different than the Vietnameses campaign.

8/10

They targeted Telecom Firms pretending to be the Intelligence Service of Russia (FSB)

RTFs content
So Gobelin Panda targets like the report of CrowdStrike https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281OBQ-266/images/ReportGlobalThreatIntelligence.pdf he telecom industries in Russia.

Conclusion
Goblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian with the same
exploitation techniques for Vietnameses Officials. They updated theirs technics than the
report of NCC group.
