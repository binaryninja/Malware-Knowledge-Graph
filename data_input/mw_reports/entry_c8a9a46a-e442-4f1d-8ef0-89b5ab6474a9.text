Few cybercrime groups have gained as much notoriety—both for their actions and for their
mystique—as the Lazarus group. Since they ﬁrst emerged back in 2007 with a series of
cyberespionage attacks against the South Korean government, these threat actors have successfully
managed to pull off some of the most notable and devastating targeted attacks—such as the widelyreported 2014 Sony hack and the 2016 attack on a Bangladeshi bank—in recent history.
Throughout the Lazarus group’s operational history, few threat actors have managed to match the
group in terms of both scale and impact, due in large part to the wide variety of tools and tactics at
the group’s disposal.
The malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus’ arsenal. This malicious
software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent campaign targeting
ﬁnancial institutions using watering hole attacks. The variant used during these attacks
(TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and software
targeting banking systems. We analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL–
A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PE
executable form—a version that other researchers also recently identiﬁed.
We identiﬁed a number of servers Lazarus used as a backend system for temporarily holding stolen
data. We were able to access this backend, which provided us with valuable information about this
attack and its victims.
Around 55% of the victims of RATANKBA’s Powershell version were located in India and
neighboring countries. This implies that the Lazarus group could be is either collecting intelligence
about targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning. They could have also been
performing exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets.
The majority of the observed victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft
software. Less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users, which means that
currently, RATANKBA mostly affects smaller organizations or individual users, not larger
organizations. It’s possible that Lazarus is using tools other than RATANKBA to target larger
organizations.
Lazarus’ backend logs also record victim IP addresses. Based on a reverse WHOIS lookup, none of
the victims can be associated with a large bank or a ﬁnancial institution. However, we did manage
to identify victims that are likely employees of three web software development companies in India
and one in South Korea.
Infection Flow

Figure 1: RATANKBA Infection Flow
RATANKBA is delivered to its victims using a variety of lure documents, including Microsoft
Ofﬁce documents, malicious CHM ﬁles, and different script downloaders. These documents
contain topics discussing either software development or digital currencies. The growth of
cryptocurrencies may be a driving force behind the use of cryptocurrency-related lures.
An example of a lure used in a RATANKBA attack can be seen below:

Figure 2: Malicious CHM ﬁle used as RATANKBA lure
Once the lure’s recipient opens and executes the ﬁle, a backdoor will be dropped into the victim’s
system. This RATANKBA backdoor is what is used to communicate with RATANKBA’s
Command-and-Control (C&C) server. We have observed two initial conversations with the C&C
server (all are done via HTTP GET or POST to the server):
HTTP POST to {script}.jsp?action=BaseInfo&u=XXX: Sends the victim information to the
backend server
HTTP GET to {script}.jsp?action=What&u=XXX: Checks if there are any pending jobs for the
backdoor
This means that the backdoor is responsible for both uploading victim information, as well as
executing any tasks that the controller has assigned to it, which includes the following:
Killkill: Stops the backdoor’s activities
interval: Changes the interval in which the backdoor retrieves jobs; the default interval is set at 120
seconds
cmd: Executes shell commands
exe:Reﬂectively injects a DLL downloaded from a speciﬁc URL
In addition to the backdoor’s modus operandi, the attackers will use a Microsoft WMI commandline tool to list the compromised system’s running processes, which are sent to the C&C server:
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | ﬁndstr
SysWOW”
“C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” /c “wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | ﬁndstr
x86”
Technical Analysis

During our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware’s Lazarus Remote Controller
tool. The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send jobs to any
compromised endpoint. The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims’ host
by queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrieves
the collected information.

Figure 3: RATANKBA communication diagram
The RATANKBA malware has a control model that does not use real-time communication between
the backdoor and the attacker. Instead, both the remote controller and the backdoor connect to its
main communication control server to push or pull pieces of information. The controller uses a
graphical UI interface and can be used to push code to the server, while the backdoor regularly
connects to the server to check for pending tasks. The controller downloads the victim proﬁles from
the server. If the proﬁles are already downloaded by the controller, they are deleted from the server
side. The controller can post victim-speciﬁc tasks as well as global speciﬁc tasks to the server.
Below are the various functionalities of RATANKBA’s controller:

delete_inf
delete_con

Cmd
delete_cmd
broadcast_cmd:

Function
Retrieves the server time
Deletes the downloaded victim proﬁles
Deletes the connection log ﬁles if they were
already downloaded
Posts a job to kill the backdoor
Posts a job for DLL injection
Changes the sleep interval
Posts a job for command shell execution
Retrieves the job results and deletes the posted
job
Posts a job for all the backdoors connecting to
the server

RATANKBA’s controllers use the “Nimo Software HTTP Retriever 1.0” user-agent string for its
communication. The communication protocol format for the controller and backdoor is as follows:
<domain>/<jsp ﬁlename>.jsp?action=<corresponding actions plus additional needed
parameters>`
One of most notable changes on the new RATANKBA variant is that the new version was written
in Powershell, whereas the original variant was in PE form. The shift from PE to Powershell makes
it more difﬁcult for antivirus solutions to detect. The screenshot below shows the conversion from
C/C++ code to Powershell, while the protocol remained unchanged.

Proﬁle of the Attackers
While we do not have any knowledge of who the actual Lazarus attackers are, the data collected
from the backend systems gives us some insights into the internet usage patterns of systems likely
owned by Lazarus group members. Clues regarding the proﬁles of the attackers was also found,
including those connected to developers and at least one operator. All of them appear to be native
Korean speakers, or at least have Korean language proﬁciency that is at the near-native level. We
believe at least one of them also understands Chinese.
We also observed clues that the attackers are interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)
and Ant Share (NEO). One of them transferred shares of NEO at a good market price.

Defending against RATANKBA
Given Lazarus’ use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it’s reasonable to
assume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.
Overall, an organization will need multilayered security strategies, as Lazarus and other similar
groups are experienced cybercriminals who employ different strategies to get past organizational
defenses.
The impact of this malware can be mitigated with proven mitigation techniques such as routinely
scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and
spreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an
organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when
it comes to malicious attacks.
Other mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s
perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help
prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.
Trend Micro™ Deep Security™ and Vulnerability Protection provide virtual patching that protects
endpoints from threats such as malicious redirections to malware-hosting URLs as well as those
