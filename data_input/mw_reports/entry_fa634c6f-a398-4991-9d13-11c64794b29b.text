Undetected Golang-Based Stealer Emerges and Baffles Security Vendors
In recent years, macOS has become increasingly popular among users, largely due to its userfriendly interface, which is often commended for its simplicity and ease of use.
macOS is also often perceived as being more secure than other operating systems. Despite this,
Threat Actors (TAs) have continued to target macOS platforms. Previously, there have been several
cases where Threat Actors have targeted macOS users with various families of malware, including
MacStealer, RustBucket, DazzleSpy, etc.
Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) recently discovered a Telegram channel advertising a
new information-stealing malware called Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS). The malware is
specifically designed to target macOS and can steal sensitive information from the victim’s machine.
The TA behind this stealer is constantly improving this malware and adding new capabilities to make
it more effective. The most recent update to the malware was highlighted in the Telegram post on
April 25th, showcasing its latest features.
The Atomic macOS Stealer can steal various types of information from the victim’s machine,
including keychain passwords, complete system information, files from the desktop and documents
folder, and even the macOS password. The stealer is designed to target multiple browsers and can

extract auto-fills, passwords, cookies, wallets, and credit card information. Specifically, AMOS can
target cryptowallets such as Electrum, Binance, Exodus, Atomic, and Coinomi.
The TA also provides additional services such as a web panel for managing victims, meta mask
brute-forcing for stealing seed and private keys, crypto checker, and dmg installer, after which it
shares the logs via Telegram. These services are offered at a price of $1000 per month.

Technical Analysis

2/14

For our analysis, we have taken the sample hash (SHA256) of “Setup.dmg” as
15f39e53a2b4fa01f2c39ad29c7fe4c2fef6f24eff6fa46b8e77add58e7ac709, which is FUD (stands for
“Fully Undetectable”) on Virustotal at the time of writing this analysis.
The TAs use a ‘.dmg’ file to disseminate this malware, including a Mac OS X executable, located at
“/Setup.app/Contents/macOS/My Go Application.app” and is a 64-bit Golang executable file.

Figure 2 – Strings related to Go Source Files of Stealer
The Atomic macOS Stealer’s primary function encompasses all of its capabilities, including keychain
extraction, crypto wallet theft, stealing browser details, grabbing user files, collecting system
information, and sending all the stolen data to the remote C&C server.
The main functions of the stealer are depicted in the figure below.

Figure 3 – Stealer’s main function
Once a user executes the file, it displays a fake password prompt to obtain the system password, as
shown in the figure below.

Keychain Password Extraction
In addition to obtaining the system password, the malware also targets the password management
tool by utilizing the main_keychain() function to extract sensitive information from the victim’s
machine. Keychain is a macOS password management system that enables users to safely store
sensitive data such as website logins, Wi-Fi passwords, credit card details, and more.
The code snippet depicted in the figure below exhibits the main_keychain() function, implemented to
gather the user’s credentials.

Stealing Crypto Wallets

4/14

After that, the stealer begins to extract information related to crypto-wallets by querying and reading
files from specific directories using the function main_GrabWallets(). The stealer targets crypto
wallets such as Electrum, Binance, Exodus, and Atomic, as shown below.

Figure 6 – Targeted Crypto-wallets

Crypto Wallet Extension
The Atomic macOS stealer can also extract information from crypto wallet browser extensions.
These extensions are integrated into the stealer binary via hard coding, with over 50 extensions
being targeted thus far.
The table below highlights some crypto wallets with respective browser extension IDs targeted by
the malware.

Extracting Browser Information
After collecting wallet details, the malware queries the installed browsers’ directories on the victim’s
device and searches for particular browser-related files to extract confidential data, such as:
Autofills
Passwords
Cookies
Credit Cards
As depicted below, the malware can steal files from various browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Yandex, Opera, and Vivaldi.

Collecting System Information
Subsequently, the malware starts the process of obtaining further hardware-related information
regarding the system, such as the Model name, Hardware UUID, RAM size, the number of cores,
and serial number, among other information. This is illustrated in the figure below.

Command and Control (C&C)
Finally, the Atomic macOS stealer processes the stolen information by compressing into ZIP and
encoding it using Base64 format for exfiltration.
The stealer communicates with the below C&C server URL and sends the stolen information.

Conclusion
Due to its robust security features, macOS is the preferred operating system for numerous highprofile individuals. Targeting macOS is not a novel trend, and various malware families exist that
specifically aim to infiltrate this operating system.
Malware such as the Atomic macOS Stealer could be installed by exploiting vulnerabilities or hosting
on phishing websites. Threat Actors can use the stolen data for espionage or financial gain. While
not commonplace, macOS malwares can have devastating impacts on victims.
