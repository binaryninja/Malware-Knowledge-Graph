Lazarus backdoor

April 8, 2021

ESET researchers have discovered a previously undocumented Lazarus backdoor, which they have
dubbed Vyveva, being used to attack a freight logistics company in South Africa. The backdoor
consists of multiple components and communicates with its C&C server via the Tor network. So far,
we have been able to find its installer, loader and main payload – a backdoor with a TorSocket DLL.
The previously unknown attack was discovered in June 2020.
Although Vyveva has been used since at least December 2018, its initial compromise vector is still
unknown. Our telemetry data suggests targeted deployment as we found only two victim machines,
both of which are servers owned by a freight logistics company located in South Africa. The backdoor
features capabilities for file exfiltration, timestomping, gathering information about the victim
computer and its drives, and other common backdoor functionality such as running arbitrary code
specified by the malware’s operators. This indicates that the intent of the operation is most likely
espionage.
This blogpost provides the first public, technical analysis of Vyveva’s components.

Attribution to Lazarus
Vyveva shares multiple code similarities with older Lazarus samples that are detected by ESET
products as the NukeSped malware family. However, the similarities do not end there: the use of fake
TLS in network communication, command line execution chains, and the way of using encryption and
Tor services all point towards Lazarus; hence we can attribute Vyveva to this APT group with high
confidence.
An example of the numerous code similarities can be seen in Figure 1 – resolving uniquely named Tor
library exports.

Technical analysis
Up until now, we have managed to find three of the multiple components comprising Vyveva – its
installer, loader and backdoor. The installer is the earliest chronological stage found and since it
expects other components to be already present on the machine, it suggests the existence of an
earlier, unknown stage – a dropper. The loader serves to decrypt the backdoor using a simple XOR
decryption algorithm.
Figure 2 provides a closer look at the functionality of the installer, the backdoor, and the Tor library.

Figure 2. Overview of Vyveva components

Installer
The main purposes of the installer are twofold: it creates a service that ensures persistence of the
backdoor loader, and it stores the embedded, default backdoor configuration in the registry.

To create a legitimate-looking service, its attributes, such as service name and display name, are
formed using a combination of words from the attributes of existing services, which are randomly
selected. It is also possible to specify these attributes to the installer via command line parameters
-dll, -svc, -disp, -desc, and -group. We observed the following in the wild, with these parameters:
<SYSDIR>\powerctl.exe -svc powerctl -dll powerctl.dll
As for the latter task, the installer first sets the configuration infection ID, which uniquely identifies
each victim, to a randomly generated value, and then stores it in the registry, as shown in Figure 3.
[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectX]
UsageMask = <CONFIG_DATA>
Figure 3. Configuration registry value
One of the entries in the configuration is a list of encrypted C&C servers: for example, the installer
sample we analyzed is configured with the following C&Cs:
4bjt2rceijktwedi[.]onion:80
cwwpxpxuswo7b6tr[.]onion:80

Backdoor functionality
The backdoor, Vyveva’s main component, connects to C&C servers and executes commands issued by
the threat actors. It features 23 commands, some of which are asynchronous and executed in their
own threads. Most of them are ordinary commands for file and process operations or information
gathering, but there is also a less common command for file timestomping. It can copy
creation/write/access time metadata from a “donor” file to a destination file or use a random date in
the years 2000—2004.
Other noteworthy commands are Vyveva’s file upload command, and command 0x26. The file upload
command is capable of exfiltrating directories recursively and supports file extension filtering – for
example, Office documents only. As for command 0x26, it indicates the existence of another,
unknown component that we have not yet observed at the time of writing.
The full list of commands is shown in Table 1.

Of particular interest are the backdoor’s watchdogs, which can be optionally enabled or disabled.
There is a drive watchdog used to monitor newly connected and disconnected drives, and a session
watchdog monitoring the number of active sessions (i.e. logged-on users). These components can
trigger a connection to the C&C server outside the regular, preconfigured three-minute interval, and
on new drive and session events.

Configuration
The configuration of the backdoor, which is initially set by the installer, is read from the registry value
(shown in Figure 3). When the configuration is modified by a C&C command, the value stored in the
registry is updated. An example configuration and its structure are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Configuration structure and annotated example

The wait_minutes field specifies the time to wait before next connection to the C&C after a failed
connection attempt. If the execution of the backdoor needs to be delayed until a particular time and
date, it can be specified in the delay_until_time field. The encrypted_cncs field is an encrypted string,
which contains semicolon-separated C&Cs.

Tor library
Vyveva uses the Tor library, which is based on the official Tor source code, to communicate with a
C&C server selected at random from the configuration. It contacts the C&C at three-minute intervals,
sending information about the victim computer and its drives before receiving commands. The

backdoor’s export directory contains the TorSocket.dll with self-explanatory exports close_ch,
connect_ch, open_ch, read_ch, write_ch.

Conclusion
Vyveva constitutes yet another addition to Lazarus’s extensive malware arsenal. Attacking a company
in South Africa also illustrates the broad geographical targeting of this APT group.
