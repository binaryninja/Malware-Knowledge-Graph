Enemybot: A Look into Keksec's Latest DDoS Botnet
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/enemybot-a-look-into-keksecs-latest-ddos-botnet
April 12, 2022

In mid-March, FortiGuard Labs observed a new DDoS botnet calling itself “Enemybot” and
attributing itself to Keksec, a threat group that specializes in cryptomining and DDoS attacks.
This botnet is mainly derived from Gafgyt’s source code but has been observed to borrow
several modules from Mirai’s original source code.
It uses several methods of obfuscation for its strings to hinder analysis and hide itself from
other botnets. Furthermore, it connects to a command-and-control (C2) server that is hidden
in the Tor network, making its takedown more complicated.
Enemybot has been seen targeting routers from Seowon Intech, D-Link, and exploits a
recently reported iRZ router vulnerability to infect more devices.
This blog details how this malware leverages these vulnerabilities and the commands it can
execute once inside an infected device.

Affected Platforms: Linux
Impacted Users: Any organization
Impact: Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systems
Severity Level: Critical

Enemybot by Keksec
One of the first things Enemybot does is to drop a file in /tmp/.pwned, containing a message
that attributes itself to Keksec. In earlier samples, this message was stored as cleartext. Only
a few days after, a new sample was released with the message encoded with an XOR
operation using a multiple-byte key. This suggests that this malware is being actively
developed.
A sample,
SHA256: fec09b614d67e8933e2c09671e042ce74b40048b5f0feed49ba81a2c18d4f473,
captured on March 24, 2022 has the message in cleartext:
“ENEMEYBOT V3.1-ALCAPONE hail KEKSEC”
A sample from March 28, 2022 SHA256:
93706966361922b493d816fa6ee1347c90de49b6d59fc01c033abdd6549ac8b9, encoded the
message with an XOR operation using a multi-byte key.
Upon decoding, the message has also been changed to:
“ENEMEYBOT V3.1-ALCAPONE - hail KEKSEC, ALSO U GOT haCkED MY [REDACTED]
(Your device literally has the security of a [shitty device] / [smart doorbell])”
Figure 1: Code snippet from decoding .pwned message
Subsequently, FortiGuard Labs researchers discovered newer samples that reverted to the
cleartext versions of the /tmp/.pwned message, which might suggest the possibility of
multiple developers working with different versions of the codebase or having different
programming habits.
Keksec is known for operating multiple botnets, some of which are based on Gafgyt (a.k.a.
Bashlite). Gafgyt is a DDoS botnet whose source code was leaked way back in 2015.
In the case of Enemybot, although it is mainly based on Gafgyt, it was observed that some of
its modules are clearly borrowed from Mirai’s source code. One of these is Enemybot’s
scanner module as shown in the screenshots below.

Another module shared with Mirai is the bot killer module where it searches for any running
processes started from certain file paths or with specific keywords in its process memory. It
then terminates these processes. Enemybot enhances the original Mirai code with over sixty
keywords to identify and kill off any competitors running on the same devices.
While researching this botnet, FortiGuard Labs observed that Enemybot shares several
similarities with Gafgyt_tor previously reported by other researchers, and assessed that
Enemybot is likely an updated and “rebranded” variant of Gafgyt_tor.

Technical Details
Infects Multiple Architectures
Like most botnets, this malware infects multiple architectures to increase its chances of
infecting more devices. In addition to IoT devices, Enemybot also targets desktop/server
architectures such as BSD, including Darwin (macOS), and x64.
Enemybot targets the following architectures:
arm
arm5
arm64
arm7
bsd
darwin
i586
i686
m68k
mips
mpsl
ppc
ppc-440fp
sh4
spc
x64
x86
Enemybot’s download server was previously misconfigured and displayed a list of ELF
binaries for different architectures (Figure 3). Threat actors have fixed this at the time of
writing.

Obfuscation

3/9

Enemybot obfuscates strings in a variety of ways:
C2 domain uses XOR encoding with a multi-byte key
Credentials for SSH brute-forcing and bot killer keywords use Mirai-style
encoding, i.e., single byte XOR encoding with 0x22
Commands are encrypted with a substitution cipher, i.e,, swapping one character
for another
Some strings are encoded by just adding three to the numeric value of each
character
While these obfuscation techniques are simplistic, they are sufficient to hide tell-tale
indicators of its presence from casual analysis and other botnets. Most IoT botnets including
Enemybot are known for searching for such indicators to terminate other botnets running on
the same device.
Infecting More Devices
In terms of spreading, Enemybot uses several methods that have also been observed in
other IoT botnet campaigns.
One way is using a list of hardcoded username/password combinations to login into devices
configured with weak or default credentials. This is another module that was copied from
Mirai’s source code.
This malware also tries to run shell commands to infect misconfigured Android devices that
expose Android Debug Bridge port (5555).
The last method is to target devices with specific vulnerabilities as listed below:
CVE-2020-17456 is a vulnerability that targets SEOWON INTECH SLC-130 and SLR120S routers. Malicious commands can be injected into the pingIPAddr parameter
(Figure 4)
Figure 4: CVE-2020-17456 exploit request
Another vulnerability (no CVE assigned) targets the Seowon SLC-130 router. This is
similar to the previous exploit, only this time the command could be injected in the
vulnerable queriesCnt parameter. The implementation was likely based on publicly
available exploit code.

CVE-2018-10823 is an older D-Link router vulnerability that allows an authenticated
user to execute a malicious command into the Sip parameter of the chkisg.htm page
(Figure 6). The following devices are affected by this vulnerability.
DWR-116 through 1.06
DWR-512 through 2.02
DWR-712 through 2.02
DWR-912 through 2.02
DWR-921 through 2.02
DWR-111 through 1.01
D-Link provided updated firmware for some of the above-mentioned devices. It’s
recommended to check and update these devices if they still have vulnerable versions.

CVE-2022-27226 is a recent vulnerability on iRZ mobile routers that was exploited by
Enemybot shortly after it was published on March 19, 2022. In fact, this is the first
botnet observed by FortiGuard Labs to target devices from this vendor.
This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute a command by adding a crontab entry in the
infected device via the /api/crontab (Figure 7).
Figure 7: CVE-2022-27226 exploit request
During the past few weeks, FortiGuard Labs researchers also observed different samples
adding and removing exploits. A list of these exploits seen in use by Enemybot for
propagation are as follows:
CVE-2022-25075 to 25084: Targets TOTOLINK routers, previously exploited by the
Beastmode botnet
CVE-2021-44228/2021-45046: Better known as Log4j, more details are available on
our Fortinet PSIRT blog
CVE-2021-41773/CVE-2021-42013: Targets Apache HTTP servers
CVE-2018-20062: Targets ThinkPHP CMS
CVE-2017-18368: Targets Zyxel P660HN routers
CVE-2016-6277: Targets NETGEAR routers
CVE-2015-2051: Targets D-Link routers
CVE-2014-9118: Targets Zhone routers
NETGEAR DGN1000 exploit (No CVE assigned): Targets NETGEAR routers
This mix of exploits targeting web servers and applications beyond the usual IoT devices,
coupled with the wide range of supported architectures, might be a sign of Keksec testing the
viability of expanding the botnet beyond low-resource IoT devices for more than just DDoS
attacks. Based on their previous botnet operations, using them for cryptomining is a big
possibility.
5/9

After a successful exploit, a shell command is executed to download another shell script from
a URL. In most cases, particularly in Mirai-based botnets, this URL is hardcoded. In the case
of Enemybot however, this URL is dynamically updated by the C2 server via the command
LDSERVER. The clear advantage of this method is that when the download server is down
for whatever reason, the botnet operators can just update the bot clients with a new URL.
The shell script update.sh then downloads the actual Enemybot binaries compiled for every
architecture it targets and executes them.
Figure 8: Code snippet from update.sh
Commands and DDoS capabilities
Once the bot gets installed on a victim’s device, it connects to its C2 server and waits for
further commands. The C2 server hides in the Tor network and the bot tries to access the
serverusing a hardcoded list of SOCKS proxy IPs.
This bot supports several commands listed in the following table.

Conclusion
Based on the analysis of FortiGuard Labs, Enemybot is Keksec’s latest tool for performing
DDoS attacks.
To protect itself, it uses simple obfuscation techniques on its strings as well as hosting its C2
server in the Tor network, taking advantage of the network’s anonymity. It uses several
techniques commonly found in other DDoS botnet malware to infect other devices.
Seeing how this malware has undergone changes during the research for this article, we
expect that more updated versions will be distributed in the wild soon.
FortiGuard Labs will keep monitoring this botnet.
