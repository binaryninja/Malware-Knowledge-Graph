After an analysis of the encryption routine of the malware used in the Petya/ExPetr attacks,
we have thought that the threat actor cannot decrypt victims’ disk, even if a payment was
made.
This supports the theory that this malware campaign was not designed as a ransomware
attack for financial gain. Instead, it appears it was designed as a wiper pretending to be
ransomware.

Below the technical details are presented. First, in order to decrypt victim’s disk the attackers
need the installation ID:

In previous versions of “similar” ransomware like Petya/Mischa/GoldenEye, this installation
ID contains crucial information for the key recovery. After sending this information to the
attacker they can extract the decryption key using their private key.
Here’s how this installation ID is generated in the ExPetr ransomware:

This installation ID in our test case is built using the CryptGenRandom function, which is
basically generating random data.

The following buffer contains the randomly generated data in an encoded “BASE58” format:

If we compare this randomly generated data and the final installation ID shown in the first
screen, they are the same. In a normal setup, this string should contain encrypted
information that will be used to restore the decryption key. For ExPetr, the ID shown in the
ransom screen is just plain random data.
That means that the attacker cannot extract any decryption information from such a
randomly generated string displayed on the victim, and as a result, the victims will not be
able to decrypt any of the encrypted disks using the installation ID.
What does it mean? Well, first of all, this is the worst-case news for the victims – even if they
pay the ransom they will not get their data back. Secondly, this reinforces the theory that the
main goal of the ExPetr attack was not financially motivated, but destructive.
Our friend Matt Suiche from Comae Technologies independently came to the same
conclusion.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
