Introduction
Targeted attacks or threats that compromise specifically
chosen targets to steal confidential information can affect
organizations in various ways, ranging from brand damage
to actual revenue loss. A recent Harvard Business Review
study revealed that the top 3 effects of targeted attacks were
potential brand damage, damage to professional reputation,
and potential loss of intellectual property.1
We continued to monitor targeted attack campaigns and
trends in the Asia-Pacific region in the first half of 2014. We
saw technique enhancements even though threat actors
continued to exploit old vulnerabilities in various software
and applications. Emails were still the most-used infection
vector when instigating targeted attacks. Watering-hole
attacks were also seen, just as we predicted would happen
this year.2

No one-size-fits-all solution exists when dealing with
targeted attacks. Every network is different, which
means each is configured differently. IT administrators
need to fully understand the networks they manage
and implement the necessary defense measures that
fit their environments.

Threat
Landscape

Refined Targeted Attack Tactics to Better
Evade Detection
One of the primary goals of targeted attacks is to exfiltrate organizations’ crown jewels or confidential company
data. Based on the previously cited Harvard Business Review study, the most commonly stolen types of data
were personally identifiable information (PII) (28%), authentication credentials (21%), intellectual property
(20%), and other sensitive corporate/organizational data (16%).
In the first haft of 2014, threat actors continued to refine their tactics to stay under the radar while stealing
information. The following are just some of the notable techniques they used:
•

Cloud-based file storage platform abuse: This June, threat actors used a Type II PlugX remote
access tool (RAT) variant to be able to use Dropbox as a download site for a backdoor’s command-andcontrol (C&C) settings.3 Abusing the cloud-based file storage platform allowed threat actors to better
evade detection despite the implementation of network traffic monitoring. Even though this was not
the first time attackers abused Dropbox, it was the first time we saw them use the platform as an update
download site for their backdoor’s C&C settings.4

A TrendLabsSM Report

•

Windows® PowerShell framework abuse: Abusing the Windows PowerShell task automation and
configuration management framework is not a commonly seen targeted attack technique.5 But in a case
seen this May, a malicious .LNK file email attachment we detect as LNK_PRESHIN.JTT had Windows
PowerShell commands that enabled it to download files and bypass execution policies to execute the files
downloaded.6 It particularly downloaded another malicious PowerShell scripting file that downloaded
the final backdoor payload.
Even though the PowerShell framework is only available on computers running Windows 7 and newer
OSs, the malware used in the attack also ran on computers running older OSs such as Windows XP SP2,
Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista, if these had PowerShell installed.

•

Sleep timer feature abuse: Apart from legitimate platform and framework abuse, we also saw a
backdoor take advantage of built-in OS features such as sleep timer in the Siesta Campaign.7 The said
backdoor could accept a sleep command that allowed it to remain dormant for varying periods of time
before regaining access to C&C servers, most likely to evade detection.

Microsoft office files used as attachments
Data from the first half of 2014 shows that Microsoft Office files are the most commonly used attachments.
This is not a surprise, as these are widely used within any type of organization. In addition, many organizations
are not able to regularly patch or upgrade their versions of Microsoft Office, leaving many exploitable
vulnerabilities for an attacker to target.

New and Old Exploits Figured in the
Threat Landscape
Zero-day and tried-and-tested exploits both figured in the targeted attack landscape. As in the latter half of
2013, threat actors continued to exploit a bug in Windows Common Controls (CVE-2012-0158) and addressed
by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-027.10, 11 The PLEAD campaign against Taiwan ministries, in particular,
was such an attack.12
Exploiting old vulnerabilities still worked because some IT administrators sometimes forgo the application of
security fixes to avoid disrupting critical business operations. Another reason could be patch testing prior to
actual implementation to ensure that fixes would not have adverse effects on corporate environments.

this April prior to the end of support for the OSs.13 The said zero-day bug was patched via MS14-002 a couple
of days after.14
The threat actors behind the Taidoor Campaign, active since 2008, took advantage of a MicrosoftTM Office
vulnerability this May.15 Likewise, a vulnerability in Ichitaro (CVE-2013-5990), a popular word processor in
Japan, was also exploited in the ANTIFULAI Campaign.16

Targeted
Attack
Campaign
Profiles

The following were some of the active targeted attack campaigns we observed targeting Asia-Pacific countries
in the first half of 2014:
•

IXESHE: Active since at least 2009, this campaign targeted East Asian governments, Taiwanese
electronics manufacturers, and a telecommunications company.22 It is notable for its use of compromised
servers for command and control to evade detection.

•

PLEAD: This campaign has become well-known for its use of the right-to-left override (RTLO) technique
to make targets think they were opening a PowerPoint® file instead of a malicious .SCR file.

•

Taidoor: Active since March 2009, the threat actors behind this campaign used a seemingly harmless
document that when opened actually executed a malicious file in the background.23 It also used malicious
.DOC files to exploit CVE-2012-0158, one of the most commonly exploited bugs up to this day.24

•

ANTIFULAI: This campaign targets government agencies and privately owned companies in Japan
by exploiting a bug in Ichitaro, which allowed the execution of malicious arbitrary code. The malware
related to this campaign successfully hid its C&C server URLs to evade detection.

10

Actors Behind the
Siesta Campaign,
Not Sleepy at All
The Siesta (Spanish term for “short nap”)
Campaign was so named due to its final payload’s
ability to receive sleep commands, which allowed
it to stay dormant for various periods of time and
in turn evade detection. It reportedly targeted
organizations from the following industries:
•

Consumer goods and services

•

Energy

•

Finance

•

Health care

•

Media and telecommunications

•

Public administration

•

Security and defense

•

Transport and traffic

Like most targeted attacks, the threat actors
behind the Siesta Campaign sent emails to chosen

Campaigns:

executives in specific organizations using fake
email addresses of supposed colleagues. They did
not, like so many attacks, use an attachment. They
instead used a legitimate-looking download link
(http://{malicious domain}/ {organization name}
/ {legitimate archive name}.zip) to compromise
their chosen network targets.

11

A TrendLabsSM Report

The .ZIP file downloaded contains an executable file we detect as TROJ_SLOTH, a supposed .PDF
file.25 When executed, SLOTH opens or drops a valid .PDF file to hide malicious activity running in the
background. It has a backdoor component we detect as BKDR_SLOTH.B, which accesses the C&C server link,
http://www.micro{BLOCKED}.com/index.html.26
The said backdoor waits for the following commands:
•

sleep: Tells the malware to sleep for a certain period of time. The sample we analyzed had the command,
“sleep:120.” This told the malware to wait two hours before accessing the C&C server.

•

download: Tells the malware to download and execute a file from a certain URL. This takes the format,
<download_url>.

Another SLOTH variant we detect as BKDR_SLOTH.A was used in the Siesta Campaign.27 This variant,
however, accessed a different C&C server, skys{BLOCKED}com.
The following table lists the commands the two backdoor variants were programmed to receive and follow.

BKDR_SLOTH.A

BKDR_SLOTH.B

run 1 - Open a remote shell

sleep: - Sleep for specified number of
minutes

run 2 - Pipe shell commands from URL 1

download: - Download and execute
another executable file from the C&C
server

run3 - Pipe shell commands from URL 2
http - Pipe shell commands from the C&C server
x - Sleep for a specified number of minutes

Digging deeper revealed that the threat actors behind the Siesta Campaign used the name “Li Ning” to register
the C&C server, sky{BLOCKED}.com. Li Ning supposedly used the email address, xiaoma{BLOCKED}@163.
com. And that apart from the C&C server link, the same actor had around 79 more registered domains. It is
safe to assume that “Li Ning” is a fake name.

A TrendLabsSM Report

The ESILe Campaign Continued to Target
Asia/Pacific Governments
The threat actors behind the ESILE Campaign continued to set their sights on governmental institutions
in the Asia/Pacific region. They used backdoors we detect as BKDR_ESILE variants to remotely execute
malicious commands on compromised networks.28
Further investigation revealed that ESILE variants exploited the same bug that Taidoor malware did, CVE2012-0158. Note that Microsoft has patched this vulnerability in 2012. Unlike the Taidoor malware, however,
ESILE variants could modify the document template to have varying payloads. This targeted attack technique
has been used by other malware such as FARFLI and HORSMY. As in most targeted attack cases, ESILE
arrived via spear-phishing emails sporting varying social engineering lures that had to do with health care
and taxes, among others. Vague filenames such as “Attachment” have also been used.
Protecting networks against targeted attacks strongly calls for building threat intelligence. This can include
lists of known indicators of compromise (IoCs) and C&C servers that can serve as reference to determine if an
organization’s network has already been compromised, thus breaking the targeted attack chain.
IT administrators would do well to check for the following known ESILE Campaign components to protect
their networks:
•

Strings:
•

EliseDLL.pdb

•

EliseDLL

•

BLOB file component that is typically dropped as {random}.CAB

•

C&C HTTP requests that match the regular expression (regex), (POST|GET)\s /[a-f0-9]{10}/page_[0-9]
{10}.html

Part of a bigger campaign known as “APT0LSTU,” the ESILE and EVORA Campaigns used RATs to establish
command and control. Our findings showed that the group behind these (LStudio) had 71 C&C servers in
10 countries. The ESILE and EVORA malware had the following PDB reference strings inside the malicious
binaries:
•

d:\lstudio\projects\lotus\evora\Release\EvoraDLL\i386\EvoraDLL.pdb

•

D:\work\nbkkkk\Lotus\Elise\EliseDLL\Release\EliseDLL.pdb

Defending
Networks Against
Targeted Attacks

Protecting networks against targeted attacks means busting common misconceptions about them. One such
misconception is that targeted attacks are one-time efforts. The truth: Targeted attacks are well-planned and
can be launched several times until they successfully compromise intended network targets.
IT administrators are strongly advised to look for the following signs of targeted attacks as countermeasure:29
•

Search for injected Domain Name System (DNS) records as attackers alter DNS settings to make sure
their malicious activity is not yet being detected by already-installed solutions.

•

Check accounts for failed or irregular log-in attempts because these could indicate lateral movement in
target networks, given the fact that threat actors often brute-force their way into administrator accounts.

•

Check for unknown large files as these may hold stolen data ready for exfiltration.

•

Monitor network logs and protocols to check for abnormal connections made.

•

Check abnormal increases in individual employees’ email activity logs.

Keep in mind that a one-size-fits-all solution to protect against targeted attacks does not exist. Organizations
need to implement what we call a “Custom Defense Strategy,” which uses advanced threat detection
technologies and shared IoCs and intelligence to detect, analyze, and respond to attacks that are invisible to
standard security products.30
