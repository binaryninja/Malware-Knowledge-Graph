Chinese actors have changed the rtf exploit following my different articles and Anomali article
https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-andindian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain
But In march a researcher of Anomali @aRtAGGI made a link very interesting between
Icefog and an article targeting Mongelian speaker
https://threatrecon.nshc.net/2019/04/30/sectorb06-using-mongolian-language-in-luredocument/

1/4

I decide to reanalyze the RTF exploit. It’s the same techniques, they have just change the
XORing and the exploit body to bypass the yara rules which have been published.

2/4

After a new rule and retro hunting, I found a new RTF file
81f75839e6193212d71d771edea62430111482177cdc481f4688d82cd8a5fed6 exploiting the
same RTF vulnerability CVE-2017–11882 and drops two files
C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Printer Shortcuts\QcConsol.exe
9f3114e48dd0245467fd184bb9655a5208fa7d13e2fe06514d1f3d61ce8b8770

The backdoor is the DLL and has as usual, the malware is executing using the side loading.
The dll is a variant of the newcoreRAT with many similarities with
05d0ad2bcc1c6e2752a231bc36d07a841f075a0a32a3a62abaafddbdafd72f62

5b652205b1c248e5d5fc0eb5f53c5754df829ed2479687d4f14c2e08fbf87e76

and the RTF is a spear phishing targeting Vietnamese people.
The malware seems to compile 11 Dec 2018 and the document has created in 2019:01:18.
The C2 of the backdoor is a old domain web.hcmuafgh.com but it’s a new IP 193.29.56.62.
