In July 2019, one of our customer’s company suﬀering the APT attack and we start
the investigation immediately. During the investigation we found a brand new
backdoor sample, which implements lots of features by using Dropbox API, using
Dropbox like a C&C server. After the reverse engineering, we extract the Dropbox
token used by the sample, dig into Dropbox folder, and reveal the whole functional
structure.
The report is co-authored with Trend Micro.
Kenney Lu, Daniel Lunghi, Cedric Pernet, and Jamz Yaneza. (17 February 2020).

Targeting Gambling Companies In Southeast Asia”

First Stage Infection
The threat actor uses Windows Defender Core Process MsMpEng.exe which has a
legal digital signature to load the malicious DLL ﬁle. Load the shellcode from the

payload ﬁle then release the ﬁnal malicious executable to complete the ﬁrst stage
infection.
During the investigation, we found a total of 8 diﬀerent loader’s ﬁlenames [Appendix 1]
renamed from MsMpEng.exe and placed at C:\ProgramData\Microsoft in its
separated folder. The loader is just called the function ServiceCrtMain imported
from mpsvc.dll .
The malicious DLL ﬁle mpsvc.dll has two types [Appendix 2]. The older type will try
to read shellcode from payload ﬁle English.rtf , decode and decompress the
content using RtlDecompressBuffer to release the ﬁnal executable (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Older type of mpsvc.dll

The newer one has a diﬀerent way to start the infection. There is a piece of
shellcode hard-coded in the mpsvc.dll , after decoding the shellcode from
mpsvc.dll , it will inject and execute to load the shellcode from mpsvc.mui
(Figure 2), which will release the ﬁnal executable and inject into the process.

Figure 2. Newer type of mpsvc.dll

Both of these two types of mpsvc.dll will release a full functional backdoor, which
can connect to the C&C server. But the ﬁnal executable released by a newer type of
mpsvc.dll has some upgrade, including the function to interact with Dropbox API.
The following article will focus on the malicious executable released by the newer
type of mpsvc.dll .
The hardcoded shellcode in a newer type of mpsvc.dll will ﬁrst allocate 0x80000
bytes of memory space. Getting the current module’s full path and replace the
extension dll to mui and read the shellcode in this mui ﬁle, then jump to the
base address of mui ﬁle plus its ﬁrst byte. (Figure 3)

Figure 3. Decoded shellcode in mpsvc.dll

In the end, the shellcode in mpsvc.mui has another diﬀerent piece of hard-coded
bytes, which will decompress by RtlDecompressBuffer to the ﬁnal malicious
executable (Figure 4).

Sample Analysis
The ﬁnal malicious executable sample we extracted has numerous features. Here is
the analysis of some major functions.

Bypass UAC
This sample can bypass UAC via .NET. It is not a new technique which was disclosed
in 2017 [1], the threat actor only changes the GUID to 9BA94120-7E02-46eeADC6-10640B04F93B (Figure 5) and specify the location of DLL ﬁle which will load
by the .NET application in the elevated process.

Persistence
There are two ways to persist. Register as a startup program in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersio
n\\Run if it has no privileged (Figure 6). Otherwise, it will register itself as a system
service (Figure 7).

Information Gathering
It will collect some basic information like IP address, hostname, username, OS
version and so on. Also, it will search the registry key’s value
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt and try to look for
the wallet address if exist (Figure 8). All of this information will upload to Dropbox as
%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S.log , below is a ﬁle sample:
Lan IP: x.x.x.x
Computer: WIN-XXXXXX
UserName: Administrator
OS: Win10(X64)
Version: 8.0

Recording Features
This sample acquired three types of recording features, including key-log, clipboard
log, and screen recording. The screen recording ﬁle naming format is [%y-%m-%d]
%H-%M-%S.avi . The key-log and clipboard log will encode by diﬀerent key and salt,
then save as <hash>.pas for key-log and <hash>.log for clipboard log (Figure 9).

Connect to C&C Server
This sample can also connect to a speciﬁc C&C server and send back data by using a
fake HTTP POST request (Figure 10).

During reverse engineering, we found that the Dropbox API token with 64
characters is hardcoded in stack string (Figure 11).

Figure 11. Code snippet for the ﬁrst 24 characters of Dropbox API token.

Besides connecting to the C&C server, this sample can also upload & download with
Dropbox API. Especially when the log ﬁle is uploaded, it will try to download
bin.asc and check the ﬁle has fake GIF ﬁle header or not. If everything is correct,
it will continue to the custom decoding phase, which will calculate with an array of
bytes hard-coded in the sample, to release the inject payload (Figure 12).

Inside of Dropbox Folder
After we got the Dropbox token, we can now dig into Dropbox by using oﬃcial API,
for example, list the account information which creates this token, list the full ﬁle
and folder information.
In the Dropbox, the folder structure like this:
/<unique_hash>/%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S.log
/<unique_hash>/bin.asc
/codex64bin.asc
/codex86bin.asc
/x64bin.asc
/x86bin.asc
Each infected victim has its folder named by unique hash /[0-9A-z]/ , this hash is
generated by machine key and some other information. %Y-%m-%d\
%H:%M:%S.log is the log ﬁle upload by the victim. *.asc is the ﬁle upload by the
threat actor. For example, bin.asc is the payload download by the victim when
the log ﬁle is upload succeeds.

Sort out the log ﬁle on Dropbox, we can get the full list of infected computers (Figure
13).

Figure 13. The list of infected computers.

Second Stage Infection
After the ﬁrst infection stage completed, it will persistent itself as a system service or
autorun program. Collecting information and establish a connection to the C&C
server. The most interesting part is each time when the log ﬁle is upload succeeds, it
will try to download bin.asc from each computer’s unique folder. Most of

bin.asc we captured is requesting the victim to download x64bin.asc ﬁle from
Dropbox.
Further analysis of x64bin.asc , we found the second Dropbox API token, its
purpose is diﬀerent from the ﬁrst one. Now the threat actor is ready to use Dropbox
as another C&C server with the full backdoor feature.
The second infection stage’s sample has some bonus features including the ability
to interact with Dropbox, the command code mapping show as below:
Command Code Action

ListDrives

ListFiles

4

ExecuteFile

5

ManageFile

6

UploadFile

OpenTerminal

In these commands, there are three diﬀerent ﬁles, each of these ﬁle has speciﬁc
ﬁlename and purpose:
eLHgZNBH : The status ﬁle, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals.
yasHPHFJ : The command ﬁle, containing command and arguments.
csaujdnc : The execution result of the command.
The status ﬁle eLHgZNBH contain the basic information about victim and
timestamp, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals. Whenever status ﬁle upload
succeeds, it will try to download the command ﬁle yasHPHFJ if it existed. Extract
the command code and arguments from yasHPHFJ then execute the command
and upload the execution result to Dropbox as csaujdnc (Figure 14).

By using this control ﬂow, the threat actor can use Dropbox as a C&C server to
control the victim’s computer even the ﬁxed connection between the speciﬁc C&C
server’s IP address has been found and blocked. Unless we block
content.dropboxapi.com and api.dropboxapi.com , otherwise we can not
isolate the infected computer.
The Dropbox API remain the detail of each ﬁle and folder, for example this is a ﬁle
information return by Dropbox API:
{
'.tag': 'file',
'name': 'Secret_File.txt',
'path_lower': '/secret_file.txt',
'path_display': '/Secret_File.txt',
'id': 'id:<UNIQUE_FILE_ID>',
'client_modified': '2019-07-21T02:45:42Z',
'server_modified': '2019-07-21T02:53:04Z',
'rev': '[0-9a-f]{6,}',
'size': 125,
'is_downloadable': True,
'content_hash': '<SHA256_HASH>'
}

It contains the server_modiﬁed timestamp even with history revision ﬁle id, we can
use rev to list the full history of this ﬁle and download it. Sort out this information
and the command code mapping, we can now list the full command executed on
each computer and its arguments. Here is two computers’ execution list (Figure 15
& 16).

Figure 15. Real command execution list from one victim.

Figure 16. Another real command execution list.

According to these record, the threat actor follows almost the same action on every
infected computer. First, download additional attack programs from Dropbox, like
mimikatz or other UAC bypass tools. Second, search the high-value ﬁle including

private source code, conﬁg ﬁle, database, and the key-log / clipboard log. Upload all
of these ﬁles to Dropbox for further searching. Last but not least, inﬁltrate the
company intranet or even the cloud service.
Combining all decoded yasHPHFJ ﬁles, we can show the threat actor’s approximate
working hours (Figure 17).

Figure 17. The threat actor’s approximate working hours.

Conclusion
We start to monitor the Dropbox for each token and parse the infected computer’s
list, here we can see the infected computer’s number from July 2019 to September
2019 this two month (Figure 18 & 19).

Figure 19. Dropbox B (second token): infected computer’s number.

We got nearly 200 infected computers at the highest peak from Dropbox A, alone
with nearly 80 computers from Dropbox B. Both of these static has a drop at August
21, 2019, the threat actor clear the Dropbox folder for some reason. Monitoring
ends on September 20, 2019, all tokens we got are revoked by the threat actor.
During these two months, we got ﬁve diﬀerent Dropbox token. Each of these tokens
has its purpose. The ﬁrst two tokens are the major one we discuss in this article,
others are more like for testing.
From the ﬁrst infection stage, established the connection between the C&C server
and Dropbox at the same time. If the IP address of the C&C server been blocked, it
can still have limited control from Dropbox. Once it completed the second infection
stage, Dropbox is turning into a second channel C&C server which has full remote
control features (Figure 20). Steal the data and inﬁltrate the whole company. This
method is not complex but very useful.
