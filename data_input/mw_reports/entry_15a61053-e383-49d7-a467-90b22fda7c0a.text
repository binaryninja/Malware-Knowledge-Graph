February 24, 2022

Against the backdrop of the military invasion of Ukraine, the CyberPeace Institute is tracking
how cyberattacks and operations are, and have been, targeting critical infrastructure and
civilian objects.
In recent weeks there has been a significant escalation in the number of reported
cyberattacks against Ukrainian institutions, organizations, including humanitarian NGOs, and
the wider population. Ukraine is no stranger to being on the receiving-end of cyberattacks
and the timeline below tracks the most significant incidents to date.
The importance of tracking cyberattacks in Ukraine
The tracking of cyberattacks and incidents as they become public is important in order to
record these attacks and identify – where possible – the harm and risks for civilian
populations. Cyberattacks affect people and risk lives. In the future, it will be important to use
the information on cyberattacks to identify developments or clarifications of the law in relation
to the use of cyber operations in armed conflicts, and for accountability including in any
future judicial proceedings.
Harm caused by cyberattacks during an armed conflict

The targeting of critical infrastructure raises particular concern as this infrastructure is
essential for the survival of the civilian population. Attacks on infrastructure such as energy,
water, healthcare, financial institutions, transport and communication services can have
devastating consequences on the civilian population. NGOs responding to the humanitarian
needs of the population in Ukraine and neighboring countries are targeted by cyberattacks in
order to disrupt their activities.
Beyond the risks to critical infrastructure and civilian objects, cyberattacks sow distrust and
limit access to accurate information or spread false information. They can also be highly
disruptive and create a sense of fear and uncertainty and even lead to the eventual
displacement of people.
Civilian populations are protected under international humanitarian law
The important legal principles of distinction (distinguish at all times between military
objectives and civilian objects) and proportionality (prohibit attacks expected to cause
excessive civilian harm) have a direct bearing on cyber operations during armed conflicts in
order to protect the civilian population against the effects of such operations.

The CyberPeace Institute’s mission is to reduce the scale and frequency of cyberattacks
against vulnerable communities, provide assistance and advocate for respect of laws and
norms. Thus, documenting cyberattacks is important to understand the harm caused to
people. The CyberPeace Builders program is a trustworthy volunteer network designed to
help humanitarian NGOs strengthen their cybersecurity.
