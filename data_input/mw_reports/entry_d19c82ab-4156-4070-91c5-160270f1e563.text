NimzaLoader Uses Nim Programming Language to Avoid Detection Prajeet Nair

An ongoing spear-phishing campaign by the threat group TA800 is distributing a new
malware loader based on the Nim programming language that's designed to help avoid
detection, according to the cybersecurity company Proofpoint.

“TA800 has predominantly used BazaLoader since April of 2020, but on February 3, 2021
they distributed this new malware we are calling NimzaLoader,” says Sherrod DeGrippo,
senior director of Proofpoint's threat research and detection team. “This malware is exclusive
to TA800, and we've only seen it distributed once. This could be a sign of more to come.”

Lewis Jones, threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Talion, notes: "The use of
Nim is uncommon for malware in the threat landscape. However we have recently seen a
Nim-based downloader used by the Zebrocy threat group. It is likely that the threat actors are
switching to Nim to avoid detection by defense teams who may not be familiar with the
language."
Proofpoint researchers also found evidence suggesting NimzaLoader is being used to
download and execute Cobalt Strike as its secondary payload.

NimzaLoader Malware
On Feb. 3, researchers discovered the Nim-based malware was being distributed via
phishing. The messages are often designed to look as if they came from within the targeted
company, DeGrippo says. “Lures have included hard-to-resist subjects, such as payments,
meetings, termination, bonuses and complaints in the subject line or body of the email,” he
says
The message contained links portrayed as a PDF preview that are actually links to a
GetResponse (an email marketing service) landing page, Proofpoint discovered.
"The landing pages contained a link to the 'PDF' which was the NimzaLoader executable
hosted on Slack and used a fake Adobe icon in an attempt to fool the user," the researchers
note.
Nim-related strings used by the malware are encrypted when stored by using an XOR-based
algorithm and a single key per string. One of those encrypted strings is a timestamp used as
an expiration date for the malware, Proofpoint says.
"At the time of research, all known NimzaLoader C2s were down, but a public malware
sandbox run seems to show it receiving a 'powershell' command that ultimately delivered a
Cobalt Strike beacon," the researchers say. "We are unable to validate or confirm this
finding, but it does align with past TA800 tactics, techniques and procedures."

Evolving Tactics
The switch to using Nim is a good example of how threat actors are constantly changing
tactics to avoid detection, Jones says.
"The activity has so far been linked to TA800, who are a threat group that has targeted a
wide range of industries infecting victims with banking Trojans and malware loaders," Jones
says. "Previous activity by the group has often shown how the group has completed initial
reconnaissance on targets to specifically target individuals with tailored phishing emails
attempting to look more genuine and increasing success of the campaigns."

In the fourth quarter of last year, TA800 was responsible for a wave of attacks against the
healthcare sector using a loader called BazaLoader DeGrippo says. “BazaLoader, under the
control of a separate threat actor, subsequently installed a ransomware strain called Ryuk.”
DeGrippo says Proofpoint's analysis corroborates analysis by other researchers that
NimzaLoader is not a BazaLoader variant. That's because NimzaLoader is written in a
different programming language and does not use the same code-flattening obfuscator.
