Insikt Group reverse-engineered the Linux and Windows variants
of BlackMatter ransomware and provided a high-level overview of the
functionality in addition to IOCs, utilities, and detections. The intended
audience of this research is threat intelligence professionals and those
interested in a technical overview of the new ransomware variant.

Executive Summary

Background
BlackMatter is a new ransomware-as-service (RaaS)
affiliate program that was founded in July 2021. According to
BlackMatter, “The project has incorporated in itself the best
features of DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit”.

According to their public blog, as shown in Figure 1 below,

Windows Ransomware Variant
According to the threat actor’s advertisement, the Windows
ransomware variant was successfully tested on Windows Server
2003 through 2021, Windows 7 and newer, and is available in
executable form, Reflective DLL and PowerShell. Insikt Group’s
analysis focused primarily on the Windows executable version,
which purports to be “version 1.2”.
The ransomware is designed to make reverse engineering
more challenging by obfuscating 3 values: imported function
calls, strings used by the ransomware, and configuration
information essential to the encryption process.
Although the import obfuscation technique (shown on the
left in Figure 2 below) is somewhat simple, the technique makes
it difficult for a reverse engineer to directly view which library
functions are being called at what point. Instead of directly calling
the exported function from the DLL, which would make the call Figure 3: String deobfuscation algorithm for BlackMatter (Source: Recorded Future)

by a base64-decode of the data.
• Then, it obtains the MachineGUID from the SOFTWARE\\
Microsoft\\Cryptography registry key and Base64encodes it. It uses this value as a unique identifier
for the ransomware, prepending it to the README.txt
ransom note filename as seen in Figures 5 and 6. The
MachineGUID value is also used to create a mutex, and
the MD4 of this value is appended to Global\<MD4
value>.

• The ransomware decodes the configuration information
using the string deobfuscation technique described
above. In the configuration data, the malware stores a
list of services and processes to stop and command and
control domains. Identifying processes and services to
stop is fairly typical of ransomware as these processes
and services may make it easier for a defender to recover
files or interfere with the encryption process.
• Next, based on the command line arguments provided
to the ransomware, it will execute a different subset
of functionality. By default, the ransomware has the
following behavior:

• Collect and send victim information to the C2,
including the computer’s hostname, the username
of the victim and other information about the
affected system. An example of this data and the
format it is contained in is below in Figure 4. A
Wireshark capture of the traffic is contained in
Figure 7.
• Optionally stops any running processes or
services, as described above. The sample
analyzed by Insikt Group looked for the following
processes and services to stop, according to its
configuration information.

• Encrypts the files on the local machine
• Sends back statistics on the encryption results,
including execution time, start time, stop time, and
the number of files encrypted to the C2
• If the system booted in normal mode, it changes
the victim’s wallpaper and creates a ransom note,
as seen in Figure 5 and Figure 6 below. If the
system booted in a failsafe mode, the malware will
execute one of the following to turn off safe mode,
based on the version of Windows:
• bootcfg /raw /fastdetect /id 1
• bootcfg /raw /a /safeboot:network /id 1
• bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
• bcdedit /set {current} safeboot network

Currently, Insikt Group’s analysis of the similarity of
BlackMatter to other Windows ransomware variants such as
DarkSide is still ongoing.

Linux Ransomware Variant
Insikt Group analyzed the Linux variant of the BlackMatter
ransomware, purporting to be version 1.6.0.2, according to a
section in the binary named “.app.version”. The Linux version
of the ransomware has several log messages, including those
providing the name of the function in which they are present, and
it contains several ESXI-targeted functions, as seen in Figure 8
below. This suggests that this may be an early version of the
ransomware, with these messages to be removed in subsequent
versions. Overall, the Linux version performs semantically
similarly to the Windows variant:

• Initializes its configuration file data. Like the Windows
version, the Linux variant stores its configuration
information in an obfuscated format to make it more
difficult to discern through static analysis of the file.
Configuration information is kept in a special ELF
section, “.cfgETD”, which is first base64 decoded, ZLIB
decompressed, then deobfuscated with a rolling 32-byte
XOR contained at the beginning of the decompressed
file. The configuration file contains C2s for the
ransomware, processes and services to stop, and other
information related to the execution of the ransomware.
• The ransomware then executes its main functionality:

• Checks if another instance of itself is running by trying
to get exclusive access to the file handle. If it cannot,
another instance is running, and the ransomware notes
another instance is currently running.
• Creates a daemon to run in the background and
detaches itself from the terminal instance used to run it,
redirecting its standard input and standard output to /
dev/null and changing its current working directory to
the root directory (/).

• First, it will optionally stop running vms, excluding
those on the “ignore list” in the configuration
file. In Insikt Group’s sample, these were VMware
vCenter and VMware-VirtualSAN-Witness. It uses
the command: esxcli --formatter=csv --formatparam=fields==”WorldID,DisplayName” vm
process list
• If kill-process is enabled in the configuration,
the ransomware will kill the specified processes;
in Insikt Group’s sample, this was limited to
vmsyslogd; this is the Syslog service running on
VMWare.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

• Stops the firewall using the command: esxcli
network firewall set --enabled false
• If message.enable is selected in the configuration
file, the malware will create a ransom note and
display it in /etc/motd or /etc/vmware/welcome.
The ransomware is also able to create a note
called ReadMe.txt with the note contents.
• The ransomware starts the “web reporter”. The
malware collects and exfiltrates information
about the host machine such as the hostname,
operating system, username, architecture and disk
information. Later, the ransomware will also report
information about the encryption process, such
as execution time, start time, how many files were
encrypted and bot version information.
• The ransomware then encrypts the victim’s files.
There are several configuration parameters related
to encryption, including the mode (single or
multiple), encryption size (dark size), white size,
and minimum size. The ransomware specifically
targets files with the extensions vmdk, vmem,
vswp, and log per the configuration file.
• If “remove-self” is enabled in the configuration file, the
ransomware removes its executable.

• Maintain offline backups of your organization’s data and
ensure that these backups stay up to date to prevent
data loss in the event of a ransomware infection.
• Network segmentation can halt the propagation of
ransomware through an organization’s network. This
solution involves splitting the larger network into
smaller network segments and can be accomplished
through firewalls, virtual local area networks, and other
separation techniques.
• If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations,
all such remote access services and protocols, such as
Citrix and RDP, should be implemented with two-factor or
multi-factor authentication.
• Cobalt Strike is frequently used by both criminal
and state-sponsored threat actors, including many
ransomware operators, both to gain a network foothold
and for lateral movement. Defenders should monitor for
Cobalt Strike C2 servers.
• Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification
activity, particularly large quantities of file modifications
in user directories.
• Consider keeping sensitive client information on
systems that are disconnected from the internet or
segmented from the rest of the corporate network. Since
ransomware will encrypt all files on a victim system
and often will search for directories on the network (eg:
networked file shares) to also encrypt, moving highly
sensitive customer data to a system with no internet
access or access to the rest of the network will minimize
the access ransomware would have to those files.

Ultimately, the Linux version of the ransomware has similar
functionality to other ransomware variants made to target ESXI
systems, but an assessment of potential code overlap is ongoing.

Mitigations
Insikt Group has created a YARA rule to detect Linux and
Windows variants of BlackMatter ransomware, which are in
the appendix of this report. Organizations can use this rule for
detection or hunting purposes. As the RaaS program grows, we
will likely see more information regarding initial access methods,
lateral movement, and discovery tools used by affiliates of the
program.
Until then, we recommend organizations employ defenses
against common techniques associated with other sophisticated
ransomware groups, such as:

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Outlook
We have seen a shift in calculus following recent high-profile
ransomware attacks. The administrators of two major Russianlanguage forums, Exploit and XSS, quickly banned ransomware
topics on their criminal underground platforms. DarkSide, REvil,
and Avaddon ransomware families halted extortionist activities
right before or days after the first meeting between President
Biden and Putin. Ransomware operators reacted and created new
ransomware brands with a strict set of rules following what was
outlined during that meeting. Moreover, BlackMatter operators
are ostensibly required to review and vet every compromised
network before deploying ransomware to avoid unnecessary
attention from the media and governments.
The Linux ransomware variant of BlackMatter falls in line with
an emerging trend of ransomware threat actors moving towards
targeting ESXi systems in addition to the more traditional
Windows. We expect that other threat actors will likely develop
Linux variants of their ransomware in the future, and we may
see new variants emerge targeting just these types of systems.
BlackMatter is suspected to be a successor to DarkSide,
and Insikt Group’s technical analysis of these tools relative to
other ransomware variants such as those published by DarkSide
is ongoing.
