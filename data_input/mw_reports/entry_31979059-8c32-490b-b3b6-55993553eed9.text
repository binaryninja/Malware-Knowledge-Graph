ViperRAT: The mobile APT targeting the Israeli Defense Force
that should be on your radar

ViperRAT is an active, advanced persistent threat (APT) that sophisticated threat actors are actively using to target
and spy on the Israeli Defense Force.
The threat actors behind the ViperRAT surveillanceware collect a significant amount of sensitive information off of
the device, and seem most interested in exfiltrating images and audio content. The attackers are also hijacking the
device camera to take pictures.
Using data collected from the Lookout
global sensor network, the Lookout
research team was able to gain unique
visibility into the ViperRAT malware,
including 11 new, unreported
applications. We also discovered and
analyzed live, misconfigured malicious
command and control servers (C2), from
which we were able to identify how the attacker gets new, infected apps to secretly install and the types of activities
they are monitoring. In addition, we uncovered the IMEIs of the targeted individuals (IMEIs will not be shared publicly
for the privacy and safety of the victims) as well as the types of exfiltrated content.
In aggregate, the type of information stolen could let an attacker know where a person is, with whom they
are associated (including contacts’ profile photos), the messages they are sending, the websites they visit
and search history, screenshots that reveal data from other apps on the device, the conversations they
have in the presence of the device, and a myriad of images including anything at which device’s camera is
pointed.
Lookout has determined ViperRAT is a very sophisticated threat that adds to the mounting evidence that targeted
mobile attacks against governments and business is a real problem.
Lookout researchers have been tracking this threat for the last month. Given that this is an active threat, we’ve been
working behind-the-scenes with our customers to ensure both personal and enterprise customers are protected from
this threat and only decided to come forward with this information after the research team at Kaspersky released a
report earlier today.
Additionally, we have determined that though original reports of this story attribute this surveillanceware tool to
Hamas, this may not be the case, as we demonstrate below.

The increasing sophistication of surveillanceware
The structure of the surveillanceware indicates it is very sophisticated. Analysis indicates there are currently two
distinct variants of ViperRAT. The first variant is a “first stage application,” that performs basic profiling of a device,
and under certain conditions attempts to download and install a much more comprehensive surveillanceware

component, which is the second variant.
The first variant involves social engineering the target into downloading a trojanized app. Previous reports alleged
this surveillanceware tool was deployed using ‘honey traps’ where the actor behind it would reach out to targets via
fake social media profiles of young women. After building an initial rapport with targets, the actors behind these
social media accounts would instruct victims to install an additional app for easier communication. Specifically,
Lookout determined these were trojanized versions of the apps SR Chat and YeeCall Pro. We also uncovered
ViperRAT in a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app.

The second stage
The second stage apps contain the surveillanceware capabilities. Lookout uncovered nine secondary payload
applications:

* These apps have not been previously reported and were discovered using data from the Lookout global sensor
network, which collects app and device information from over 100 million sensors to provide researchers and
customers with a holistic look at the mobile threat ecosystem today.
Naming additional payload applications as system updates is a clever technique used by malware authors to trick
victims into believing a threat isn’t present on their device. ViperRAT takes this one step further by using its dropper
app to identify an appropriate second stage ‘update’ that may go unnoticed. For example, if a victim has Viber on
their device, it will choose to retrieve the Viber Update second stage. If he doesn’t have Viber, the generically-named
System Updates app gets downloaded and installed instead.

What was taken
The actors behind ViperRAT seem to be particularly interested in image data. We were able to identify that 8,929
files had been exfiltrated from compromised devices and that the overwhelming majority of these, 97 percent, were
highly likely encrypted images taken using the device camera. We also observed automatically generated files on
the C2, indicating the actor behind this campaign also issues commands to search for and exfiltrate PDF and Office
documents. This should be highly alarming to any government agency or enterprise.

We observed legitimate exfiltrated files of the following types of data:
Contact information
Compressed recorded audio in the Adaptive Multi-Rate (amr) file format
Images captured from the device camera
Images stored on both internal device and SDCard storage that are listed in the MediaStore
Device geolocation information
SMS content
Chrome browser search history and bookmarks
Call log information
Cell tower information
Device network metadata; such as phone number, device software version, network country, network
operator, SIM country, SIM operator, SIM serial, IMSI, voice mail number, phone type, network type, data
state, data activity, call state, SIM state, whether device is roaming, and if SMS is supported.
Standard browser search history
Standard browser bookmarks
Device handset metadata; such as brand, display, hardware, manufacturer, product, serial, radio version, and
SDK.

Command and control API calls
ViperRAT samples are capable of communicating to C2 servers through an exposed API as well as websockets.
Below is a collection of API methods and a brief description around their purpose.

On attribution
Media reporting on ViperRAT thus far attributes this surveillanceware tool to Hamas. Israeli media published the first

reports about the social networking and social engineering aspects of this campaign. However it’s unclear whether
organizations that later reported on ViperRAT performed their own independent research or simply based their
content on the original Israeli report. Hamas is not widely known for having a sophisticated mobile capability, which
makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for ViperRAT.
ViperRAT has been operational for quite some time, with what appears to be a test application that surfaced in late
2015. Many of the default strings in this application are in Arabic, including the name. It is unclear whether this
means early samples were targeting Arabic speakers or if the developers behind it are fluent in Arabic.
This leads us to believe this is another actor.

What this means for you
All Lookout customers are protected from this threat. However, the existence of threats like ViperRAT and Pegasus,
the most sophisticated piece of mobile surveillanceware we’ve seen to date, are evidence that attackers are
targeting mobile devices.
