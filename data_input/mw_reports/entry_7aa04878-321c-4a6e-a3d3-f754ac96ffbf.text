Hello,
Run the server file (rbs_srv) with the command: sudo ./rbs_srv on your machine.
On the same machine run the client (rbs_clt) with the command : sudo ./rbs_clt
You will see in the client terminal thoses sentences :
"Hey ! Iam HAL the server, you are now connected.
Enter a command (quit for close the remote shell) :
"
Enter a linux command, the one you want and you will get the command output, simple :)
PS: if you want to run the server on a machine and the client on another machine you must
edit just a little bit the client code. In the client folder , in the file rbs_clt.c, at line 40. This one
:
hostsin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1"); // Enter here the server IP address.
You have like its written to enter the server ip adress, and then recompile the client with the
command :
1/2

gcc rbs_clt.c -o rbs_clt
Have fun !
