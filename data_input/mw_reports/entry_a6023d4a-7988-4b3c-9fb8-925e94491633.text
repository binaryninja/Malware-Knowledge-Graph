Understanding Russia’s Cyber Strategy
fpri.org/article/2021/07/understanding-russias-cyber-strategy/

The Russian Federation’s willingness to engage in offensive cyber operations has caused
enormous harm, including massive financial losses, interruptions to the operation of critical
infrastructure, and disruptions of crucial software supply chains. The variety and frequency
of these operations, as well as the resulting attribution efforts, have offered an unusually
vivid picture of Russia’s cyber capabilities and tactics. While many other countries have
relied heavily on vague strategies and threats to signal their emerging cyber powers, Russia
has exercised its technical capabilities with relative impunity for more than a decade. This
makes it possible to chart Moscow’s increasingly bold forays into the cyber domain
alongside the increasingly technically sophisticated specific vulnerabilities, techniques, and
tactics that Russia has leveraged. This timeline reveals a shift towards more covert,
targeted cyber capabilities in recent years, as well as an evolution away from phishingbased compromises to supply chain and service provider intrusions, in conjunction with a
continued reliance on and reuse of the same infrastructure and malware across multiple
operations.

Emphasis on Covert Capabilities
Going all the way back to the 2007 denial-of-service attacks directed at Estonian
infrastructure, Russia’s cyber activities have been more high-profile and deliberately publicly
visible than those attributed to any other country, with the possible exception of North
Korea. Many countries, including the People’s Republic of China and the United States,
have relied primarily on cyber capabilities for covert espionage or sabotage efforts that
could be executed over the course of months, or even years, without detection. By contrast,
Russia’s exploits in cyberspace, including the 2016 breaches of the Democratic National
Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the 2017
NotPetya attacks, often drew immediate attention, by design. Bilyana Lilly and Joe

Cheravitch describe how the visibility of Russia’s cyber operations increased over time with
the gradual shift in leadership of those operations from the FSB, Russia’s domestic security
agency, to the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, which “brought with it a culture of
aggression and recklessness” and a “high tolerance for operational risk” that was unusual in
the cyber domain.
More recently, increased activity from Russia’s civilian foreign intelligence service, SVR, has
suggested a growing emphasis on long-term, covert cyberespionage operations. For
instance, the SolarWinds compromise discovered in late 2020 went undetected for at least
nine months, probably in large part because Russia exercised uncharacteristic restraint in
targeting only a small subset of the victims that it had compromised. The malicious
SolarWinds Orion software update that was used to establish an initial foothold in victims’
computer systems was downloaded by roughly 18,000 SolarWinds customers, according to
a December 2020 SolarWinds Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That initial
foothold only offered very preliminary access to computer systems, and many of the
organizations that did download the compromised software update have not reported
further exploitation.
Speaking at an event in March 2021, Silverado Policy Accelerator Chairman Dmitri
Alperovitch referred to the SolarWinds compromise as “a very precise operation” because
Russia “did not exploit the vast majority of the 18,000 victims.” He continued, “I don’t think
they did this to do us any favors, I think the primary reason for doing that was to actually
remain stealthy.” Stealth typically requires not just restraint in cyber operations, but also
greater technical sophistication to avoid the growing number of intrusion detection and
network monitoring tools. Furthermore, it can be difficult to carry out these types of longterm covert cyber operations alongside more destructive, public-facing ones like NotPetya,
which tend to trigger increased scrutiny and attention to sensitive networks.
It’s possible that the Russian shift to more covert cyber activity is merely a byproduct of the
SVR finally developing the tools and techniques that it needed to carry out cyberespionage
campaigns, rather than an indication of a long-term shift in Russia’s overall cyber strategy.
It’s also plausible that the relative inactivity of the GRU in the cyber domain since 2018,
when the SVR began ramping up its efforts to access cloud resources, is a deliberate,
strategic choice on Moscow’s part to draw less attention to its online operations. In the
future, that balance could swing back in the other direction, with the GRU executing more
disruptive cyberattacks, but given the shared reliance on some of the same infrastructure,
malware, and techniques, such a shift might well jeopardize some of the SVR’s operations.

Tactics, Vulnerabilities, and Technical Sophistication
Russia’s shift to more covert operations means that it is relying less heavily on techniques
like traditional phishing and denial-of-service attacks. Instead, the focus is on more
advanced intrusion tactics like credential harvesting, supply chain compromises, and

2/6

infiltrating critical service provider platforms. Russia’s growing technical sophistication is
evident in its growing reliance on customized malware rather than tools and programs
purchased from the black market. Security firm Crowdstrike has traced this progression
across different Russian groups, identifying how Russian threat actors have developed
custom plug-ins for commodity malware products like Black Energy and then moved to
developing entire families of custom malware, including Snake, Chinch, Skipper, Kazuar,
and Gayzer.
Recent custom malware has also exhibited advanced implementation of cryptographic
techniques as well as anti-analysis protections to help shield it from detection by anti-virus
software. Russia has leveraged existing popular platforms, including social media sites and
the Tor relay network, in designing and delivering its malware to victims. This suggests an
increasing ability and willingness to make use of the broader online ecosystem in cyber
operations. Still, Russian cyberattacks continue to use open source and commercially
available tools with a recent Department of Homeland Security alert flagging the SVR’s use
of both the open-source credential dumping tool Mimikatz and the commercially available
exploitation tool Cobalt Strike.
As Russian malware has become increasingly complex, so too have the vulnerabilities that
Russia is able to exploit in victims’ computer systems. The 2017 NotPetya attacks famously
relied on the exploitation of the EternalBlue vulnerability in Windows’ Server Message Block
protocol that was developed by the National Security Agency and then leaked in April 2017
by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. Not only did Russia not identify the
EternalBlue vulnerability, but it also was not even the first to exploit the vulnerability—North
Korea launched the WannaCry attacks that made use of the same vulnerability earlier in
2017, though the later NotPetya attacks proved much more damaging. Similarly, attempts
by Russia to compromise computer networks in 2020 through virtual private network (VPN)
infrastructure used some previously identified and patched vulnerabilities, rather than novel
zero-day vulnerabilities. This move suggests that Russia had not devoted significant
resources to develop or purchase its own vulnerabilities, choosing instead to rely largely on
those already identified. This model limited the reach of Russia’s cyberattacks, in some
cases, and perhaps partly motivated the shift to relying on supply chain and service
provider-based infiltration tactics that enabled broader access to a larger number of victims.
Expanding the reach, as well as the covertness, of its online intrusion activities has been a
central theme of Russia’s cyber operations in 2020, accomplished largely through infiltrating
third parties, rather than targeting victims directly. These third-party intrusions make
compromises more difficult for breached entities to detect—because they are introduced
through trusted sources like a company’s security dashboard or email provider—and allow
for targeting many more victims simultaneously, through the compromise of a single
company. In its 2021 Global Threat Report, Crowdstrike notes that targeted malware and
phishing campaigns have become less central components of Russian cyber operations.
According to the report, “While various Russian adversaries continue to employ malware as

3/6

part of their operational toolkits, they have also increasingly sought to shortcut traditional
operational workflows and focus directly on intelligence collection from third-party services
used by their targets, including direct access to cloud-based network resources such as
email servers.”
In May 2021, six months after the discovery of SolarWinds, Microsoft announced that it had
identified another Russian espionage campaign that relied on accessing a United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) account. The attack distributed phishing
emails to 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different government agencies, think
tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations. Unlike traditional email phishing
attacks that rely on tricking a recipient into believing they’ve received an email from
someone they know or trust based on a spoofed or misleading sender address, the Russian
campaign that Microsoft identified made use of an intermediary service for email marketing
called Constant Contact. This tactic makes it more difficult for recipients to identify the true
sender and easier to disguise malicious links and attachments. Just as the compromise of
SolarWinds’ Orion software update allowed Russian adversaries to infiltrate thousands of
victims undetected, the Constant Contact email compromise enabled a similarly large-scale,
covert intrusion by relying on a widely used third-party service.

Infrastructure and Malware Reuse
While the technical tactics and sophistication of Russian cyber operations have evolved,
many of these exploits continue to rely on shared infrastructure and malware families that
enable attribution of new attacks and suggest that Russia relies on a limited circle of
suppliers and software developers in this domain. Executing cyber operations often requires
considerable infrastructure deployed across many countries. For instance, Russia registers
domain names that are very close to the names of legitimate websites in order to set up
phishing websites. It also rents virtual private servers (VPS) to conduct password spraying
attacks, in which commonly used passwords are tested on different accounts to see if any
of them work. Since login attempts from foreign countries are often flagged as suspicious,
this infrastructure generally must be in the same country as the victim, so that the login
attempts go undetected. The Department of Homeland Security noted that this local VPS
infrastructure was typically procured from a network of VPS resellers by Russian threat
actors using false identities. The temporary email accounts and Voice over IP (VoIP)
numbers associated with those identities could often be traced back to a small number of
“low reputation infrastructure” providers and domains, so there were clear, persistent
patterns across these efforts even as the technical implementation of Russia’s cyber
capabilities expanded and evolved.
Russia’s growing emphasis on covert capabilities in recent years has necessitated the
development of more sophisticated and novel intrusion capabilities, particularly those
focused on compromising third-party companies that could then be used as a platform for
infiltrating other victims. However, Russia’s development of more technically sophisticated
4/6

intrusion tactics and malware has not yet been matched by similarly advanced detection
and exploitation of novel vulnerabilities or the establishment of more robust underlying
infrastructure for these compromises. This has enabled continued attribution of
cybersecurity incidents to Russia and has provided an unusually detailed picture of where
exactly Russia has chosen to invest its resources in developing cyber capabilities and
which elements of its online tactics and techniques are most—and least—advanced.
Moving forward, it will be interesting to watch whether the Russian government continues to
avoid directly targeting critical infrastructure in favor of operating covert cyberespionage
campaigns. If this trend does continue, then it will also be important to track whether Russia
continues to allow criminal organizations based within its borders to launch destructive
attacks on overseas critical infrastructure targets, as happened in May 2021 when the
DarkSide cybercrime group hit Colonial Pipeline with a ransomware attack, causing a
shutdown of thousands of miles of a pipeline, and when the REvil group hit meatpacking
company JBS with a similarly disruptive ransomware attack. In some ways, these attacks
are reminiscent of NotPetya in their impacts, except that they are financially motivated and
therefore comparatively more narrowly targeted and more easily reversible. If Russia’s
government agencies back off initiating destructive cyberattacks but continue to condone
Russian cybercriminals launching similar attacks, then it’s unlikely that the tensions
between the United States and Russia over the acceptable use of cyber capabilities will
ease, despite some small signals that the two countries may be willing to try to reach an
agreement on not targeting critical infrastructure. That agreement would have to include a
serious commitment by Russia to police cybercriminals and cooperate with international law
enforcement investigations to stem destructive cyberattacks in any meaningful way. So far,
at least, there are no clear signs that Russia is interested in making any such commitment.
