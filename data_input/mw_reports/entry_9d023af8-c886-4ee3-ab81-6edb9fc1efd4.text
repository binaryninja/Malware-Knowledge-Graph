overview
Spear phishing attacks have long been one of the most convenient ways to get
into an enterprise network . Spear phishing attacks are often used against large
corporations, banks, or influencers, and most commonly target high-level employees
who have access to rich information, or employees in departments that need to open
a lot of foreign documents at work . Generally speaking, attack files are macro code
written in Microsoft Word or JavaScript code, which are ver y small, have no
superfluous programs built into the files, and whose sole purpose is to download
more destructive malware on the target object's computer. Once downloaded,
malware spreads further through the targeted network or is only used to steal all
available information, helping attackers find targets in the network .
recently, the red raindrop team of the qianxin threat intelligence center has
captured a large number of spear phishing attack samples against south korean
companies in the daily threat hunt. it is infected through a vulnerable document or
chm file, and distinguishes the number of bits of the current operating system, and
executes macro code corresponding to the number of bits of the system to achieve
the best attack effect. after research, the characteristics of this attack are as follows:
1. THE INITIAL INFECTED DOCUMENTS ARE DOWNLOADED FOR SUBSEQUENT
EXECUTION USING CVE-2017-0199 REMOTE CODE EXECUTION VULNERABILITY;
2. The subsequent attack uses the UAC Bypass technology of the local RPC
interface to elevate the privilege;
3. subsequent load packing interference analysis and use simple means to detect
whether it is in the sandbox;

sample analysis
0x01 decoy file

The attack sample captured this time is a docx file, all of which use the Microsoft
Office/WordPad remote code execution vulnerability, its vulnerability number is CVE2017-0199, and the decoy analysis of the related samples is as follows:
the bait file induces the victim to click "enable content" in a number of ways. for
example, 긴급재난지원금신청서양식 .docx (emergency disaster assistance request form)
induces users to click on enable content by displaying garbled file content.

The bait file 대한광산개발(주) .docx (Daehan Mine Development Shares) shows that
the document was produced by Windows 11, inducing the victim to click on the
enabled content.

or fake microsoft's error message, the same purpose is to induce users to click to
enable content.

0x02 malicious macro
Here, take 통지서 .docx (notification) as an example, click on the execution bait fil
e, access the remote template http://VM2rJOnQ.naveicoipg.online/ACMS/0hUxr3Lx/p
olice0?mid=h1o5cYfJ download execution, and the file downloaded and executed is a
s follows.

The macro code embedded in the file first downloads the attached payload
(32Bit/64Bit) from the outside:

mount page for payload:

the payload is then decr ypted and injected into the winword .exe process.

0x03 injected code
the injected code is first anti-sandboxed in the main function.

At the same time, it will detect whether the currently running process contains v3l
4sp .exe, and if so, exit the program. v3l4sp .exe a subroutine of south Korean AhnLa
b's free antivirus software V3 Lite, indicating that the target of this attack is not for in
dividual users in South Korea.

Subsequently, the error .log is released in the %AppData%Local\Microsoft\TokenB
roker director y, and "s/o2ldz9l95itdj2e/error.txt?dl=0", and the Release RuntimeBroke
r .exe is decr ypted in the same director y.

The UAC Bypass technology of the native RPC interface is then used to perform
the RuntimeBroker .exe.

finally, it is persisted through the registr y startup key.

0x04 RuntimeBroker.exe
RuntimeBroker .exe interfered with the researchers' analysis by adding a UPX shel
l, and after dehulling, it was found that it also detected the sandbox in the main func
tion, and also detected whether the currently running process contained v3l4sp.exe a
nd AYAgent.aye. AYAgent.aye is part of ALYac, south Korea's Internet security suite, es
tsoft.

Verify whether the currently running program path is a RuntimeBroker .exe in the
%AppData%Local\Microsoft\TokenBroker director y, or delete itself if it is not, which is
to evade dynamic detection of the sandbox.

It is then added to windows Defender's exclusion list using the PowerShell
command.

Read the contents of the released error .log file and stitch it together with the
URL dl.dropboxusercontent.com of the cloud ser ver Dropbox, so that it acts as an
intermediar y to pass the C2 information.

The user information is then uploaded to the hxxp://naveicoipg.online/post2.php
in the specified format "uid=%s&avtype=%d&avtype=%d&major v=%d", where the va
lue of avtype is 1 when no soft kill is specified, 2 when v3l4sp .exe is present, and 3 w
hen AYAgent.aye is present.

Subsequent visits naveicoipg.online's "/fecommand.acm" page to get the payload,
where uid is the victim ID of the previous callback C2.

the obtained instruction content calls the function sub_401410 executed, and the
malware maintains an array of structs of size 100 to record the executed instructions.

If the instruction has not been executed before, the calling function sub_401280
download the corresponding subsequent payload from C2, download the subsequent
URL format is "/< instruction name >", and the obtained content will be executed as
a PE file.

unfortunately, subsequent content is not available as of the time of analysis.

traceability and correlation
By searching the database for the keyword "fecommand.acm", we discovered
another way to spread attack samples, distributed by using CHM files.

The retrieved chmext .exe malicious program whose parent file is a CHM file.
the short link in the bait chm file was redirected to the actual website of the
korean centers for disease control and prevention, which echoed the bait file name,
making it easier for the victim to get caught.

After comparison, the chmext .exe is basically the same as the above injected cod
e, only C2 is different, chmext .exe C2 is naveicoipc.tech.

IN THE PROCESS OF CONTINUING TO TRACE THE SOURCE, WE ALSO FOUND
PHISHING EMAILS THAT IMPERSONATED THE KOREAN INTERNET INFORMATION
CENTER. COMBINED WITH VARIOUS INDICATIONS, WE SUSPECT THAT THIS ATTACK IS

FROM THE HANDS OF THE APT ORGANIZATION, ITS ATTACK TARGET IS NOT AN
INDIVIDUAL

ORDINARY

USER,

THE

ATTACK

METHODS

ARE

COMPLEX

AND

CHANGEABLE, ITS FOLLOW-UP REAL PAYLOAD IS RELATIVELY HIDDEN, AND THE
NUMBER OF ATTACK SAMPLES IS LARGE, AND WE HAVE CAPTURED A LARGE NUMBER
OF ATTACK SAMPLES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

Combing through the APT organization targeting South Korea, we found that this
attack is suspected to be from the APT organization Lazarus, as early as a few years a
go, the Lazarus organization was good at using the cloud ser ver Dropbox to carr y out
the attack , followed by the Februar y malwarebytes labs disclosed Lazarus's report [1] ,
Lazarus also created the RuntimeBroker process in the attack process.

Coincidentally, in the process of tracing the origin of C2, we found that as early a
s March 25, the foreign security company Rewterz made an early warning of the navei
coipc.tech domain name [2] , and the URL link in its warning was basically consistent w
ith the sample link we captured earlier.

summary
as of the end of the draft, there are still new attack samples being discovered, whi
ch is worth our vigilance!
PHISHING EMAILS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE IMPORTANT MEANS OF ATTA
CKS BY APT ORGANIZATIONS, AND MOST USERS ARE NOT SECURITY-CONSCIOUS AN
D ARE EASILY CONFUSED BY SPOOFED EMAILS, DISGUISED DOCUMENTS, AND DECEP
TIVE HEADERS. THE QIANXIN RED RAINDROP TEAM REMINDS USERS TO BEWARE OF
PHISHING ATTACKS, NEVER OPEN LINKS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN SHARED ON SOCIAL
MEDIA , DO NOT CLICK ON EMAIL ATTACHMENTS THAT EXECUTE UNKNOWN SOURCE
S, DO NOT RUN UNKNOWN FILES WITH EXAGGERATED TITLES, AND DO NOT INSTALL

APPS FROM IRREGULAR SOURCES. BACK UP IMPORTANT FILES IN A TIMELY MANNER,
UPDATE AND INSTALL PATCHES.
If you need to run, install an application of unknown origin, you can first use the
Qianxin Threat Intelligence File Deep Analysis Platform (https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.co
m/sandbox/page) to identify. At present, it supports in-depth analysis of files in vario
us formats, including Windows and Android platforms [3].
AT PRESENT, THE FULL RANGE OF THREAT INTELLIGENCE DATA BASED ON THE QI
ANXIN THREAT INTELLIGENCE CENTER, INCLUDING THE QIANXIN THREAT INTELLIGEN
CE PLATFORM (TIP), TIANQING, TIANYAN ADVANCED THREAT DETECTION SYSTEM, QI
ANXIN NGSOC, ANDRXIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS, ETC., HAVE SUPPORTED THE AC
CURATE DETECTION OF SUCH ATTACKS.
