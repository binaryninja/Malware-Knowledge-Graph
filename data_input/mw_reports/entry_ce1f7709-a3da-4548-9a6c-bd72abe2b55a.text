The worldwide pandemic did not slow down malicious cyber activity; it fueled it. As early as
February 2020, we began observing an increase in malicious activity. In April, one of the largest
cyber attacks targeting Taiwan in 2020 was the targeted attack on the CPC Corporation — a
state-owned petroleum, natural gas, and gasoline company and the largest gasoline supplier in
Taiwan with roughly 25% of the gas stations on the island nation.
CPC Corporation wasn’t alone; ten more organizations in critical infrastructure were also
targeted for attack that exact same weekend.

Incident Overview

2/18

On May 4, multiple CPC (台灣中油股份有限公司) gas stations across Taiwan suddenly became
unable to accept payment by CPC VIP cards or electronic transaction apps. Customers had to
pay in cash or by credit card until the payment system was up again.

Fig. A —
In the beginning, the state-run CPC denied allegations of being hacked and having their
systems compromised. In truth, the CPC had been the victim of a targeted ColdLock
ransomware attack.
On May 15, (ten days after the CPC incident), the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice
(MJIB) released an investigation report stating that the CPC was one of more than ten victims in
this sophisticated and organized ColdLock ransomware attack. The unnamed ten included

other organizations in Taiwan’s critical infrastructure, even a large multinational semiconductor
vendor.

Fig. B —
CPC Corporation is not our customer; however, we were involved in investigations
regarding other critical infrastructure (CI) victims of the attack’s unnamed ten.
This successful, sophisticated attack targeted CI on a national scale, denied service across the
country, interrupted the daily life of the common citizen, and brought brief but significant
economic turmoil.

Incident Timeline
4/18

This timeline was constructed by combining the findings from our own investigation and an
analysis of the threat intelligence presented in the MJIB report.

Fig. C — CPC Incident Timeline
Prior to April 26 — The attackers gain initial access and escalate privileges. They have
decided (or planned) to wait before acting on their objectives.
April 26 — The attackers initiate their attack just before midnight.
April 27 — The first backdoor is installed.

5/18

April 28 & 30 — While the attackers were not directly active in the victim’s environment on
these days, GPO was leveraged by the attackers to automate the distribution of the
ransomware throughout the entire system from April 28 to the day of the attack.
April 29 — The second backdoor is installed under a different file with the same name but with
a different hash. This second backdoor becomes the main backdoor used in the operation.
May 1 to 3 — Extended holiday weekends, like the Labor Day holiday weekend, are generally
considered an ideal time for cyberattacks as most technicians or security analysts would be on
vacation, increasing both detection and response time. The Labor Day holiday weekend was,
unfortunately, an ideal time for GPO to automate the distribution of the ransomware throughout
the entire system, maximizing the number of affected endpoints for the day of the attack.
May 4 — CPC initially claims a mere system crash; however, as talks of ransomware quickly
begin to surface, CPC admits to being victim to a ransomware attack. As CPC is considered
critical infrastructure for the country, citizens are gravely concerned about the CPC attack.
However, unbeknown to the general public, several other organizations had been targeted as
well.
May 4 to 6 — The attackers launch attacks against their other intended targets one after
another. Their attack procedure remains the same; backdoors are installed before midnight,
GPO distributes the ransomware throughout the targeted system, and the ransomware begins
encrypting and deleting data just after 12 noon of the following day.
May 6 — Chunghwa Telecom announces it has been breached and releases IoCs and other
relevant threat intelligence. Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunications company and
the incumbent local exchange carrier of PSTN, Mobile, and broadband services in Taiwan.
Their report is the first report of this operation that contained IOCs, which were later used to
attribute the same threat actor for the attacks on Chunghwa Telecom, CPC, and our customer.
May 7 — The malware has been contained and eradicated; the CPC system begins operations
without further incident. Our future customer, who had not yet contacted us, follows their postintrusion playbook policies and begins performing clean reinstalls on all their endpoints.
May 15 — The MJIB issues both a press release and threat intelligence report of the CPC
attack.

System-Level Threat Hunting
The initial automated environment scan of our customer’s environment, which consisted of 7
thousand endpoints and 382.9 million files, immediately identified 4 suspicious endpoints and 3
suspicious files as a severe threat to the environment. Level 10 threats (as were these) are
considered by the CyCraft AIR platform as the most malicious threats an environment could
possibly face.

All information in this blog and our report has gone through de-identification and
anonymization.

information in this blog and our report has gone through de-identification and anonymization.

Findings
By referencing the published threat intelligence from both Chunghwa Telecom and the MJIB
with the intelligence from our own investigation, we concluded that our customer was also
targeted by the same threat actors behind both the CPC and Chunghwa Telecom attacks.
7/18

When our investigation began, all AD servers had already had a clean reinstall of their OS;
however, three system admin endpoints (JOHN706_NB, MIS201_NB, MIS312_NB) still
contained artifacts, including backdoors that were still connected to malicious C2 servers
(64[.]64.234.24 and 104[.]233.224.227).

Fig. E — CyCraft AIR Cyber Situation Graph
The backdoor malware (CDPSSVC.DLL) discovered in the system admin endpoint had the
exact same hash as the one in the Chunghwa Telecom IoC Report.

8/18

Fig. F — CyCraft AIR screenshot of known malware found on customer endpoint
The two IP addresses (64[.]64.234.24 and 104[.]233.224.227) were also both listed as
malicious C2 servers in the Chunghwa Telecom IoC Report.
Further investigation into the system admin endpoint, MIS201_NB, revealed CobaltStrike
Beacon malware that had both identical malware hashes and C2 addresses as those listed in
the Chunghwa Telecom.

Actions on Objectives

9/18

The attackers had gained high-privileged access into the target system at least one week prior
to the attack; however, there is a strong likelihood the target system had been compromised
even months before May 4.
The attackers had scheduled the backdoor malware, dewm.exe and qwins5.exe, to be installed
on the system admin endpoints at precisely 11:46 p.m. on April 26 and 12:00 a.m. on April 27.

Fig. G — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph of malicious (pink) processes. Notice the time
stamp on each malicious process.
73 minutes later, at 1:01 a.m. on April 27, the attackers acted again and installed the main
backdoor program (CDPSSVC.DLL) onto the system admin endpoint. Fig. H shows that in
addition to install.bat, the attackers also issued several more commands. Unfortunately, only

10/18

CDPSSVC.DLL remained on the endpoint we investigated as the other files had been removed
by the previously mentioned clean reinstall.

Fig. H — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph — endpoint process tree
In this process tree (Fig. H), the attackers use “reg add” to add a registry in the services called
CDPSsvc and install service by the “sc create” command.

11/18

Fig. J — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph — endpoint process tree
It’s important to note that the backdoor malware and the ransomware are separate. A few
moments after installing the main backdoor malware, at 1:01 a.m. on Monday, April 27, the
attackers used the GPO to distribute the ransomware throughout the entire system over the
next three business days and the 3-day Labor Day weekend. The ransomware then laid
dormant and activated on Tuesday, May 5.

12/18

Fig. K — lc.tmp PowerShell attacks executing CodeLock ransomware
Although the ransomware started execution when the host endpoint was booted up on May 4,
the ransomware waited until 12:10 p.m. (Tuesday, May 5) to begin encrypting files and
destroying data. There are several reasons for this scheduled delay: it would be difficult for
engineers and security analysts to respond immediately at this time, and it was the second day
back after a long weekend.

13/18

Fig. L — Encryption and Deletion did not begin until 12:10 in the afternoon.
A closer look into the malware revealed this particular variant of ColdLock had removed all the
payment information, contact email, and the RSA public key. This indicates that no information
could be provided for decryption.

Ransomware-as-a-Smokescreen
Ransomware incidents have dramatically increased in frequency, severity, and complexity ever
since the release of Bitcoin in 2009 as well as the numerous other cryptocurrencies that
followed. This consistent and dramatic rise suggests that ransomware does work and attackers
do get paid.

14/18

However, ransomware’s increase in media and academic coverage has led to a relatively
recent development. Ransomware has become notorious enough that attackers have now
begun to weaponize the fear of ransomware, employing ransomware as a smokescreen for
other malicious intents.
In terms of this particular incident, the existence of various versions of this particular
ransomware on VirusTotal (VT) and the lack of decrypting messages suggest that the attackers
had no intention of providing their victims a means of decrypting their encrypted files — yet
another reason why many cybersecurity vendors strongly recommend against paying
ransomware.
In addition to the lack of sophistication in the malware used in this attack, specific attacker
behavior proved inconsistent with observed behavior in previous ransomware attacks, such as
the decision to not delete volume shadow copies, as doing so would dramatically increase the
possibility of recovery.
As this attack was also launched just one week before Taiwan’s presidential inauguration,
targeted multiple organizations in multiple industries, used a lack of sophisticated ransomware,
displayed non-optimal attacker behavior, and was attributed to China-linked threat groups by
the FBI, the MJIB, and us, it becomes increasingly more likely that the end objective of this
attack was not financial gain but political deterrence.
The ransomware was just a smokescreen used to confuse and delay investigators. The
attackers had weaponized the fear of ransomware to deceive defenders and achieve their end
objectives.
