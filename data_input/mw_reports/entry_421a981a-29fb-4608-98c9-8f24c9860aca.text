Introduction
The ART team at Fortinet has discovered a new malware named Proteus, a multifunctional
botnet written in .NET that appears to be a proxy, coin miner, e-commerce merchant account
checker, and keylogger. This particular botnet is downloaded by the Andromeda botnet. The
handful of malicious features densely packed in this new malware also includes the ability to
drop other malware. We have compiled its main features in this brief analysis.
Data Encryption
All C&C communication is encrypted with a symmetrical algorithm. All strings used in this
botnet are also encrypted using the same algorithm. Part of the encrypted hostname string is
shown below:

Figure 1 Partial Encrypted Hostname
And the encrypted hostname is: http://prot{removed}twork.ml/ which is used as the C&C
domain.
A simple decryption Algorithm is provided below:

Preparation
The sample arrives obfuscated, drops a copy of itself in the %AppData% folder as
chrome.exe, and executes the copy. It then creates a hardcoded mutex to ensure there is
only one instance of itself running.

Figure 3 Mutex Name
In order to register the botnet with the C&C server, it sends an initial registration message
with several pieces of information regarding the infected machine. The packet for registering
the bot takes the format as below:
{"m":"<Encrypted MachineName>", "o":"<Encrypted OperationSystem>", "v":"
<Encrypted BotVersion>"}

Figure 4 Bot Registering Function
The fingerprint consists of the processor, BIOS and baseboard information of the infected
machine, as shown below.

The bot comes with a hardcoded default fingerprint, as shown below. However, it appears
that the default fingerprint is always overwritten by the above-mentioned newly generated
fingerprint, which is a unique identifier for the infected machine. The fingerprint is included in
the HTTP header in the authorization field.

Figure 6 Default Fingerprint
MachineName is retrieved by calling the Win32 API GetComputerName, OperatingSystem is
the OS architecture x64 or x86. The BotVersion is obtained from the assembly version that
the code is executing in:

Figure 7 Bot version
The C&C server responses with an encrypted string that reads “successful.” Then the bot
plays ping pong with the server to make sure it’s live in order to carry out the rest of its
malicious actions.

Features & Tasks
Proteus creates six threads for different tasks, as follows:
Task

Description

SocksTask

creates a socket and sets up port forwarding

MiningTask

appears to use SHA256 miner for mining digital currency *

3/5

EMiningTask

appears to use CPUMiner and ZCashMiner for mining digital currency *

CheckerTask

validates given accounts

CommandsTask

kills current process or downloads and executes an executable on
request

LoggerTask

sets up keylogger

Table 1 Tasks and Descriptions
* The bot verifies with the server during runtime to determine which miner to use for mining
digital currency such as Bitcoin.

Figure 9 Check Module for MiningTask

Figure 10 Check Modules for EMiningTask
For SocksTask, MiningTask, EMiningTask and LoggerTask, the bot first sends a
CheckModule message by providing its program fingerprint and corresponding module name
to the C&C server. The server then sends a command back to the bot, indicating whether or
not the bot should proceed with the requested task.
For CheckerTask, the bot first requests an account from the C&C server. If the server replies
with an account to the bot, the bot will proceed to check the given account on some wellknown e-commerce websites including eBay, Amazon, and Netflix. Some of the websites
are on German (.de) domains. Similarly, for CommandsTask, the bot first requests a
command from the server and then executes the command if it is valid.
Conclusion
The Proteus botnet has a combination of features including coin miner, proxy server,
keylogger, and many more. It is also capable of downloading and executing a file. All of this
in one botnet may be even more harmful than one might first think, as it could download
anything and execute it in the infected host. Our team will continue to monitor this botnet
family and provide more information as it comes to light.
