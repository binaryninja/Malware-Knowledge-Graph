Key Findings and Takeaways:
The Conti ransomware threat actors are shown to be a multi-layered organization that
operates like a company that hires and even fires contractors and salaried employees
alike
Key figureheads and the roles they play to grow Conti’s enterprise will be discussed
Conti’s overhead costs (tracing bitcoin transactions to employees and funds dispersed
for services and tools) have been detailed
Project Blockchain – An effort to create their own altcoin has been discovered
Operational details of Conti’s workflow reveals how they compromise, escalate, and
receive payments
The various tools used to spy on and compromise victims are now better documented

Overview:
Globally, groups, countries, and companies have been bracing for impact from potentially
crippling attacks in the wake of last week’s announcement by the global ransomware group
Conti to execute cyberattack campaigns supporting Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
However, in late February 2022, the infosec community began circulating leaks provided by
a Ukrainian security researcher that detail multiple years of internal chat logs and more of
Conti operations.
Conti is the source of a broad range of ransomware attacks, many of which have been
focused on “Big Game Hunting,” looking for large payouts. However, the analysis of the
leaks of the chat logs has shown that they do not limit attacks to just large companies or
targets and do go after small businesses. The warnings of new attacks comes-off the heels
of an anonymous tip believed to be the aforementioned Ukrainian researcher who leaked
this treasure trove of data. This blog dissects the internal chat logs that illuminate how
Conti’s organizational infrastructure is run details key figureheads, tooling as well as bitcoin
transactions. This analysis will help organizations better understand the inner workings of
Conti’s organizational infrastructure.

I. Conti Figure Heads

1/34

Stern: “The Big Boss”
Stern is the captain of the ship; he is responsible for tasking team leads, the disbursement
of wages, and budgeting for the tools and services needed for the organization as a whole.
Log analysis shows Stern sending over 4000 messages to various members of the
organization.

Salamandra: “HR/Recruiter”

2/34

The operator Salamandra is a critical part of the success of Conti, his role is one of “HR
department “ and helps in negotiating with new candidates and their roles. Salamandra also
assists with the recruiting services and combs through resumes looking for the right
candidates. Salamandra is the conduit to getting people onboarded and put in the right
position to excel in their new role.

Bio: “Blogger/Negotiator”
Bio helps the teams negotiate with the victim organization and writes blogs for Conti. These
blogs are usually about the compromised victims and includes their captured information,
and the percentage of data released depending upon how ransom payment goes. Bio
makes sure that Conti provides the decryptor key to the “customer” to honor the contract if
paid in full.

3/34

Mango: “Team Lead”
Mango, a very vocal leader responsible for Team C, is seen spearheading many different
operations throughout the chat logs. Seen below we can see Mango informing leader Stern
on his team’s burn rate for the month.

Revers: “Tech Lead”
4/34

Revers is responsible for technical interviews with prospective new hires, helps with
onboarding, and ensures his team and new recruits have all the equipment they need for
work.

Bentley: “System Admin”
Bentley keeps track of server farms and sends requests to pay for expenses incurred while
paying for multiple workers within Conti. He always makes sure that each team pays for
their tooling on time and asks for crypto reports from each team lead.

5/34

Twin: “Training”
Twin is the person that could potentially be the most vital part of the Conti group, he
provides in-depth training and provides new recruits with different scenarios they may
encounter when compromising a target’s environment. Twin is the “HOW TO PERSON”

6/34

II. Conti’s Organizational Infrastructure
Recruiting/Onboarding
Conti recruits their workers in a few different ways, the first is recommendations from
current trusted workers. The other is using recruiting services to find candidates with the
skillsets Conti needs to fill. One of the services that Conti uses is hhcdn.ru. This service
allows Conti’s HR department to access the resume database to view potential qualified
candidates’ information. An analyzed chat from HR “Salamandra” informs “Stern” that the
services introduced a significant change in the pricing models but they could get a
discounted rate. (hxxps://hhcdn[.]ru/file/16899324.pdf).

7/34

Interviewing at Conti is a bit more problematic. Conti has the interviewees wait in a chat
room and gives them questions over chat and not via video. The Conti group does not have
video as part of this process due to many of the candidates leaving the chat rooms before
the interview begins as well as a way to maintain operational security of its members. The
candidates that do pass the interview negotiate the terms of salary and the role they will
have in the organization. Once they are officially hired, they go through “Newbie Induction
Training”. Conti keeps the work that the new candidates will be doing vague to prevent
recruits from understanding too much of the organization they are joining. Call it willful
ignorance, operational security or skillful recruitment, but it looks like new candidates do not
entirely understand the organization they’ve agreed to work for. This may be a contributing
factor to Conti’s high turnover rate.

8/34

Conti understands that the turnover ratio of workers is also very high due the fact that they
are running a criminal organization. The Conti Group has an HR/Recruiter that assists with
the continual finding and recruitment of new candidates. Once the candidates begin working
on a project, the supervisors begin with onboarding the workers that require training. This
usually encompasses training manuals and one-on-one interaction. Stern, the Boss whose
role we will go into his in the Conti Figure Heads section, often asks other workers, “how
are you doing on recruiting people? can we start recruiting again or are we still training?” In
one of the chat logs released users1-8 are training to understand how to use the tools and
techniques in the Conti organization’s arsenal. We can see tl1 and tl2 providing direction for
certain situations potentially affecting workstations/networks and informing the trainees
what they should do if said issues arise.

9/34

Conti’s Structure
Conti understands that it needs talent with skills to continue making money through its
victims. The leadership of Conti provides the direction the organization will follow. With the
Conti Leaks release and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we believe Conti’s leaders will be
more motivated to intensify its efforts, as the rubles continue to plummet. Many analysts
think that due to sanctions many Russians will be moving to bitcoin until the rubles
stabilizes. The Boss, “Stern”, provides payment via bitcoin to all workers under Conti. Many
of Conti’s workers ask “Stern” directly for payment via bitcoin throughout the leaks.
However, in the chat logs, we also see top-level managers providing burn rate summaries
of their team’s workers and asking for payment from Stern.
Teams are divided into groups, and each group is assigned a team leader. If the size of the
group exceeds a certain amount, the group may have multiple leaders. Team leaders are
responsible for issuing work cases, helping with builds, networks, and other technical issues
related to software, providing manuals and guides to newly developed software, and
ensuring their workers have the support they need to succeed. The workers are explicitly
required to “Listen, Do, Learn, and Ask questions, Follow the guides and instructions,
complete the assigned tasks”. The screenshot below is an example of what each group’s
workers are expected to do:

10/34

Conti is constantly hiring talent. Some messages from team leads have requests for Full
Stack developers, Crypto developers, C++ developers and php developers. Once hired they
are assigned to a team to create different tools like lockers, spamming, backdoor tools
and/or admin panels. Many of the web applications had been previously written in php, and
the released software was missing code and was almost impossible to get working. This all
had to be fixed. Reverse Engineers are tasked with diffing Microsoft updates to know what
changes come after system updates. A recent discussion with the boss to a team lead “We
need someone to keep track of fixes from MS and the like to know what changes come
after system updates, office updates, etc. Just like they track us, we need to analyze them
and be aware of all the current changes right away. What do you think about that?”, they
also reverse engineer endpoint protection products to bypass protection that may tamper or
inhibit their success in any way. The OSINT teams look for targets by collecting information
from openly available sources online with various techniques. Admins assist in managing
compromised enterprise networks and collecting victim information critical to their business
to extract the maximum amount of payment. Testers help by evaluating and verifying that
the Conti tooling does what it is supposed to do in specific environments. The chat logs
reveal the daily Windows Defender signature test to ensure that Conti’s tools would not be
detected.
Hunting For What Matters
When Conti compromises an organization, they follow specific processes that they’ve used
in the past to ensure a foothold into the network. When the Conti group compromises Active
Directory, they are looking for potentially interesting people like an admin, engineer, or
someone in IT. Many companies think that backups are sufficient, but Conti hunts for
backup servers to encrypt the backups as well as training manuals reveal that they know
techniques to bypass backup storage vendors to make sure the backups are encrypted.
One of the instructions that stood out the most was a section titled “HOW AND WHAT INFO
TO DOWNLOAD” that they state after raising the privileges to domain admin and invoke
11/34

share finder, what Conti is interested in are financial documents, accounting, clients,
projects, and much more. They understand that it all depends on the target organization to
get the information needed for the victims to pay.

III. Conti’s Project Blockchain
In June of 2021, Stern sends a message to the channel asking, “Are there any of us who
consider ourselves blockchain gurus and trendsetters? Who might know where to go in this
direction and what to develop”. 21 days after his initial inquiry, he messages Logan. He lays
out the direction for an altcoin (Altcoin: A coin other than Bitcoin) to build their own
blockchain, and he wanted Logan to study the system, code, and working principles. Stern’s
appetite to make Conti’s altcoin is shown to be a high-priority project.

12/34

Stern has been involved with ransomware activity for more than four years. In November of
2021, Stern stated that he was losing interest in ransomware campaigns and wanted to set
his sights on blockchain technology and new projects. Stern has invested money in the
blockchain department, Stern’s blockchain transactions reveal a substantial financial and
operational overlap. A security researcher tweeted Conti and Ryuk pay “stern” direct
commissions from ransom victim payments.

13/34

The chat logs reveal in February 2022 that there is a blockchain department and the team
lead is Collin. Another team lead, Mango, informed another worker that “blockchain needs
people” and that the Boss approves all the expenses to try to get him to move to that
department. In another conversation from Demon and Van, “you and I are exactly where on
the blockchain for two years” the below screenshot shows how far they are from completing
the development of their own blockchain. Based on the leaks, we can infer that they are
thinking of writing the Conti’s blockchain in Rust as there are only a dozen or more altcoins
written in Rust.

IV. Conti’s Bitcoins Transaction
Conti, like many other ransomware gangs, used tokens like Monero for transaction
anonymity. However, it is easier for targeted organizations to get a hold of Bitcoin when
dealing with ransomware groups like Conti. But what we can see when using tools like
blockchain.com is the transaction history, amount, time, and bitcoin wallet addresses used
to pay Conti’s ransom. We extracted a total of 255 bitcoin wallets in the Conti Leaks. We
focused on the transaction history of these wallets and the amounts that were sent for Conti
organizational usages like salary, tooling, and services. They are few transactions made to
these Bitcoin wallets. Many of them had less than three payments in total. These wallets act
like shell companies and one-off payments to other Bitcoin wallets are made because they
disguise transactions, so it does not stand out from the norm. Studying the leaks, we see
that Conti has spent an estimated 6 million dollars on employee salary, tooling, and
professional services from January 2021 to February 2022.
A tool used by Conti when dealing with Bitcoin is Segwit wallets. Segwit stands for
“Segregated Witness” and these wallets use a technique while processing transactions that
helps it reduce transaction fees. Segwit tackles a major problem with bitcoin’s scalability. It
makes the Bitcoin blockchain lighter by storing the witness data on a sidechain, making
each bitcoin transaction use 65% less data when recording transactions on the blockchain.
The lighter data allows for faster transaction speeds which lead to reduced fees, and when
dealing with the volume of Bitcoin that Conti deals with, this can be a great benefit.
Conti transfers an immense amount of money via bitcoin. Some security researchers have
estimated that Conti’s total revenue is over $2.7 billion. Ransomwhe.re has been tracking
the amount of money earned by different ransomware crime groups. They have reported
that since September of 2021 Conti has made a total of $50,881,191.17.
Conti puts on an eminently professional façade when conducting several of their business
processes. In the “Recruiting/Onboarding” section we dive into how the hiring procedure
works for new recruits coming into Conti. The onboarding process might seem
unprofessional and unstructured to the recruits, but Conti tries to cover that up with a
legitimate HR department. The dodgy recruiting process does deter many candidates but
the ones that stay are sure to be well compensated. Based on what was leaked, we can

14/34

estimate that there have been 485 people that have gone through the Conti system. This
includes employees, victims, and potential candidates who may have declined to participate
in the group.
Another display of Conti’s professionalism theatrics is in their data and asset recovery
process. Conti takes payment seriously; when a target pays the ransom, the recovery of the
target’s assets and data will be “Priority 1” on Conti’s list. Conti even has a tech support
staff on hand to assist targets and they are even willing to negotiate ransoms depending on
how prominent their target is. This small display of empathy and assistance could be a
factor that makes the victims more willing to pay their ransoms.

V. Conti Armament
Trickbot
Trickbot, is a popular modular malware botnet used for credential theft. Trickbot is spread
primarily through phishing campaigns, once infected victims are subject to system
reconnaissance and follow-on ransomware and additional malware infections.
Mimikatz
Mimikatz is an open-source application that allows users to view and save credentials.
Conti commonly uses Mimikatz to steal credentials and escalate privileges.

https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert
Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is used by Conti to deploy software on victim machines to perform malicious
actions. Functionality includes command execution, keylogging, file transfer, privilege
escalation, and often the installation of Mimikatz. Conti also uses this tool for Command and
Control (C2) and payload staging. Additional tools such as obfuscators are used in
orchestration with Cobalt to increase Conti’s success rate.

Conclusion
The Rise of Mini Conti’s
Ransomware attacks have increased steadily over the years and many groups have
emerged since Covid-19 began spreading worldwide due to remote work becoming the
norm. Conti is a mature and well-seasoned group that will successfully make any necessary
changes to mitigate the long-term damage from these leaks. Conti is known for using spearphishing campaigns to gain access and compromise networks through low-hanging fruit

18/34

vulnerabilities and this tactic certainly will not change. The leaks reveal Conti’s arsenal and
their mindset, and researchers at BreachQuest believe that many offspring or splinter
ransomware groups will appear as this level of knowledge and insight that has never before
been shared.
To ensure that you’re protected from threat actors like Conti it’s essential to have a modern
XDR that can defend your organization’s endpoints. Organizations must be proactive and
take the necessary steps to ensure that your network is secure from threat actors.
