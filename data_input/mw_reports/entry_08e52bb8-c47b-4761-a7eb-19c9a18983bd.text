Counter Threat Unit Research Team

Hades ransomware has been on the scene since December 2020, but there has been limited
public reporting on the threat group that operates it. Secureworks® incident response (IR)
engagements in the first quarter of 2021 provided Secureworks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU)
researchers with unique insight into the group’s use of distinctive tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs).
1/11

The financially motivated threat group operating the Hades ransomware is known as GOLD
WINTER. Some third-party reporting attributes Hades to the HAFNIUM threat group, but
CTU™ research does not support that attribution. Other reporting attributes Hades to the
financially motivated GOLD DRAKE threat group based on similarities to that group’s
WastedLocker ransomware. Despite use of similar application programming interface (API)
calls, the CryptOne crypter, and some of the same commands, CTU researchers attribute
Hades and WastedLocker to two distinct groups as of this publication.
Ransomware groups are typically opportunistic: they target any organization that could be
susceptible to extortion and will likely pay the ransom. However, GOLD WINTER’s attacks on
large North America-based manufacturers indicates that the group is a “big game hunter”
that specifically seeks high-value targets.

Unique TTPs
Analysis of these IR engagements revealed TTPs not associated with other ransomware
families. Some of the tactics and tools may be similar to those used by other threat groups,
but GOLD WINTER added some unusual aspects.

‘Tox’-ic conversations
Hades’ absence on underground forums and marketplaces suggests that it is operated as
private ransomware rather than ransomware as a service (RaaS). GOLD WINTER “names
and shames” victims after stealing their data but does not use a centralized leak site to
expose the exfiltrated data. Instead, Tor-based Hades websites appear to be customized for
each victim (see Figure 1). Each website includes a victim-specific Tox chat ID for
communications (see Figure 1). Using Tox instant messaging for communications is a novel
technique that CTU researchers have not observed with other ransomware families.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
GOLD WINTER has a propensity for copying ransom notes from other high-profile
ransomware families. The Hades ransom note samples observed by CTU researchers
duplicated REvil or Conti ransom notes. The REvil look-alike ransom note (HOW-TODECRYPT-<victim ID>.txt) featured a unique victim identifier that was hard-coded in the
ransomware executable (see Figure 2). This ransom note referred each victim to a
personalized Tor victim site, whose URL is hard-coded in the malware.

In early April, CTU researchers observed the threat actors dropping a Conti look-alike
ransom note (CONTACT-TO-DECRYPT.txt). It included contact email addresses instead of a
website, indicating a potential change in TTPs. GOLD WINTER may use look-alike ransom
notes to confuse researchers or perhaps to pay homage to admired ransomware families.

Name game
CTU researchers also observed the threat actors shifting from using a randomly generated
five-character string for the victim ID and encrypted file extension to using words. A March IR
engagement revealed use of a single word: “cypherpunk”. Based on the definition of this
term, perhaps the threat actors view their ransomware activity as a way to prompt
organizations to improve their security.

Two IAVs are better than one
CTU researchers identified two distinct initial access vectors (IAVs) across the analyzed
environments. In some intrusions, the threat actors used stolen or guessed credentials to log
in via a virtual private network (VPN) that did not implement multi-factor authentication. The
second IAV was SocGholish malware delivered via fake browser updates. SocGholish is
commonly associated with the GOLD DRAKE threat group.

Threat actor toolbox
GOLD WINTER’s tools include Cobalt Strike Malleable C2, Mimikatz, Advanced Port
Scanner, PsExec, Metasploit, and MSBuild. Most of these tools are commonly observed in
compromised environments. But in one uncommon implementation used in a Hades
intrusion, MSBuild executed a file containing a Metasploit payload (see Figure 3).

CTU researchers also observed two scripts that repeatedly stopped services (see Figure 4)
and cleared event logs (see Figure 5). Both scripts featured a distinctive 60-second ‘sleep’
loop.

The threat actors disguised the Cobalt Strike executable as a Corel Draw graphics
application (see Figure 6) to obfuscate the true nature of the file. While spoofing legitimate
applications is not unusual, the use of Corel Draw is unique.

GOLD WINTER has used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and reverse SOCKS proxies
(see Figure 7) to maintain access to victims’ environments. The MEGAsync cloud storage
platform was used for data exfiltration.

Ransomware analysis
Some Hades samples analyzed by CTU researchers use the “ClassicStartMenu.exe”
filename and have December 2020 creation dates, which coincides with the first reports of
the ransomware. The Hades ransomware executable copies itself into a random
%AppData% folder and then executes via the “/go” argument. It checks the compromised
environment for virtualization and debugging tools. Like many other ransomware families,
Hades deletes volume shadow copies using the “vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet”
command. It also uses a distinctive self-delete command with an unusual inclusion of a
waitfor command: cmd /c waitfor /t 10 pause /d y & del "<ransomware file path>" & rd "
<ransomware folder>".

Infrastructure
CTU researchers observed commonalities across IP addresses and domains used by GOLD
WINTER. The threat actors leveraged IP provider Selectel (see Figure 8), and the IP
addresses fall under AS49505.

The domains associated with GOLD WINTER infrastructure were issued by Russian registrar
REG.RU (see Figure 9). Most of these domains were created in June 2020; the exception is
bingoshow . xyz, which was registered in January 2021. Registration data for this domain
shows the state as Indiana but a country code for Finland and a New Jersey phone number,
likely indicating that the threat actors deliberately provided misinformation. All the identified
domains have links to the identified Selectel IP addresses.

Conclusion
CTU researchers track threats and behaviors identified during IR engagements to
understand the nature and evolution of various threats. Through countermeasure
development, periodic trend analysis, and ad-hoc tactical reporting on activity observed
during these engagements, CTU researchers continuously provide protection, insight, and
guidance derived from real-world incidents to Secureworks customers. In many ways, the
GOLD WINTER threat group is a typical post-intrusion ransomware threat group that
pursues high-value targets to maximize how much money it can extort from its victims.
However, GOLD WINTER’s operations have quirks that distinguish it from other groups.
It is crucial for organizations to diligently respond to early signs of threat actor activity before
encryption occurs. Staying one step ahead of the threat actors is increasingly difficult as they
evolve their TTPs. Organizations do not have the luxury of time when it comes to
investigating pre-infection activity.
