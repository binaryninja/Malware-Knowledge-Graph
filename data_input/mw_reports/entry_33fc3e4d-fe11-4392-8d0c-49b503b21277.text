China may have gained the upper hand.

Spear-phishing, step by step
Step 1: Web due diligence

Step 2: Building the spear-phish

Cyber-spies study potential spear-phishing
targets by combing previously purloined data
and information on the Internet, including
public documents, job descriptions, government
and corporate organizational charts, and how
the targets write and sign-off on emails.

Attackers then craft an email, usually containing
an attachment or a Web link, designed to make
the target think the message is real and from an
expected source. Attachments often relate to
actual events or contain useful information.

After the link is clicked or the email’s attachment is opened, the malicious code is unleashed and begins
to search for useful data, sometimes very specific documents such as product designs and strategic plans,
as well as more email addresses, usernames and passwords to repeat the process. The data is sent
“home” to a computer operated by hackers which control the code.

"Byzantine Hades" by U.S. investigators -to the Chinese military. An April 2009 cable
even pinpoints the attacks to a specific unit of
China's People's Liberation Army.
Privately, U.S. officials have long suspected
that the Chinese government and in
particular the military was behind the cyberattacks. What was never disclosed publicly,
until now, was evidence.
U.S. efforts to halt Byzantine Hades hacks
are ongoing, according to four sources
familiar with investigations. In the April 2009
cable, officials in the State Department's
Cyber Threat Analysis Division noted that
several Chinese-registered Web sites were
"involved in Byzantine Hades intrusion
activity in 2006."
The sites were registered in the city of
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province
in central China, according to the cable. A
person named Chen Xingpeng set up the
sites using the "precise" postal code in
Chengdu used by the People's Liberation
Army Chengdu Province First Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB), an electronic
espionage unit of the Chinese military. "Much
of the intrusion activity traced to Chengdu is
similar in tactics, techniques and procedures
to (Byzantine Hades) activity attributed to
other" electronic spying units of the People's
Liberation Army, the cable says.
Reconnaissance bureaus are part of
the People's Liberation Army's Third
Department, which oversees China's
electronic eavesdropping, according to an
October 2009 report by the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Commission, a panel
created by Congress to monitor potential
national security issues related to U.SChina relations. Staffed with linguists and
technicians, the Third Department monitors
communications systems in China and
abroad. At least six Technical Reconnaissance
Bureaus, including the Chengdu unit, "are
likely focused on defense or exploitation of
foreign networks," the commission report
states.
The precise relationship with the Chinese
Army of suspected hacker Chen Xingpeng
could not be immediately determined by
Reuters. A spokesman for the Chinese
embassy in Washington did not respond to
multiple requests for comment. The U.S.
State Department declined to comment.

government reports underscore how Chinese
and other state-sponsored and private
hackers have overwhelmed U.S. government
computer networks. In the last five years,
cyber-intrusions reported to the U.S.
Computer Emergency Response Team, a unit
of the Department of Homeland Security,
have increased more than 650 percent, from
5,503 incidents in fiscal 2006 to 41,776 four
years later, according to a March 16 report by
the Government Accountability Office.

intrusions is unknown. A study released
by computer-security firm McAfee and
government consulting company SAIC on
March 28 shows that more than half of some
1,000 companies in the United States, Britain
and other countries decided not to investigate
a computer-security breach because of the
cost. One in 10 companies will only report a
security breach when legally obliged to do so,
according to the study.
"Simply put, corporations cannot afford
negative publicity (about computer security
breaches)," says Tom Kellermann, vice
president of security awareness at Core
Security Technologies and a contributor to
the study.

THE BUSINESS OF SPYING

The official figures don't account
for intrusions into commercial computer
networks, which are part of an expanding
cyber-espionage campaign attributed to
China, according to current and former U.S.
national security officials and computersecurity experts.
In the last two years, dozens of U.S.
companies in the technology, oil and gas and
financial sectors have disclosed that their
computer systems have been infiltrated.
In January 2010, Internet search giant
Google announced it was the target of a
sophisticated cyber-attack using malicious
code dubbed "Aurora," which compromised
the Gmail accounts of human rights activists
and succeeded in accessing Google source
code repositories.
The company, and subsequent public
reports, blamed the attack on the Chinese
government.
The Google attack "was certainly an
escalation of Chinese network operations
against the U.S.," says Joel Brenner, former
counterintelligence chief for the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence.
"Thousands" of U.S. companies were
targeted in the Aurora attacks, Brenner says
-- far more than the estimated 34 companies
publicly identified as targets so far -- a scale
which Brenner says demonstrates China's

"heavy-handed use of state espionage
against economic targets."
Many firms whose business revolves
around intellectual property -- tech firms,
defense group companies, even Formula One
teams -- complain that their systems are now
under constant attack to extract proprietary
information. Several have told Reuters they
believe the attacks come from China.
Some security officials say firms doing
business directly with Chinese state-linked
companies -- or which enter fields in which
they compete directly -- find themselves
suffering a wall of hacking attempts almost
immediately.
The full scope of commercial computer

What is known is the extent to which
Chinese hackers use "spear-phishing" as
their preferred tactic to get inside otherwise
forbidden networks. Compromised email
accounts are the easiest way to launch spearphish because the hackers can send the
messages to entire contact lists.
The tactic is so prevalent, and so
successful, that "we have given up on the
idea we can keep our networks pristine," says
Stewart Baker, a former senior cyber-security
official at the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security and National Security Agency. It's
safer, government and private experts say,
to assume the worst -- that any network is
vulnerable.
Two former national security officials
involved in cyber-investigations told Reuters
that Chinese intelligence and military units,
and affiliated private hacker groups, actively
engage in "target development" for spearphish attacks by combing the Internet
for details about U.S. government and
commercial employees' job descriptions,
networks of associates, and even the way
they sign their emails -- such as U.S. military

personnel's use of "V/R," which stands for
"Very Respectfully" or "Virtual Regards."
The spear-phish are "the dominant attack
vector. They work. They're getting better. It's
just hard to stop," says Gregory J. Rattray,
a partner at cyber-security consulting firm
Delta Risk and a former director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council.
Spear-phish are used in most Byzantine
Hades intrusions, according to a review of
State Department cables by Reuters. But
Byzantine Hades is itself categorized into at
least three specific parts known as "Byzantine
Anchor," "Byzantine Candor," and "Byzantine
Foothold." A source close to the matter says
the sub-codenames refer to intrusions which
use common tactics and malicious code to
extract data.
A State Department cable made public
by WikiLeaks last December highlights the
severity of the spear-phish problem. "Since
2002, (U.S. government) organizations have
been targeted with social-engineering online
attacks" which succeeded in "gaining access
to hundreds of (U.S. government) and cleared
defense contractor systems," the cable said.
The emails were aimed at the U.S. Army, the
Departments of Defense, State and Energy,
other government entities and commercial
companies.
Once inside the computer networks, the
hackers install keystroke-logging software
and "command-and-control" programs
which allow them to direct the malicious code
to seek out sensitive information. The cable
says that at least some of the attacks in 2008
originated from a Shanghai-based hacker
group linked to the People's Liberation

Army's Third Department, which oversees
intelligence-gathering
from
electronic
communications.
Between April and October 2008, hackers
successfully stole "50 megabytes of email
messages and attached documents, as
well as a complete list of usernames and
passwords from an unspecified (U.S.
government) agency," the cable says.
Investigators say Byzantine Hades
intrusions are part of a particularly virulent
form of cyber-espionage known as an
"advanced persistent threat." The malicious
code embedded in attachments to spearphish emails is often "polymorphic" -- it
changes form every time it runs -- and
burrows deep into computer networks
to avoid discovery. Hackers also conduct
"quality-assurance" tests in advance of
launching attacks to minimize the number
of anti-virus programs which can detect it,
experts say.
As a result, cyber-security analysts say
advanced persistent threats are often only
identified after they penetrate computer
networks and begin to send stolen data to
the computer responsible for managing
the attack. "You have to look for the 'phone

home,'" says Roger Nebel, managing director
for cyber-security at Defense Group Inc., a
consulting firm in Washington, DC.
It was evidence of malicious code phoning
home to a control server -- a computer that
supervises the actions of code inside other
computers -- that provided confirmation to
U.S. cyber-sleuths that Chinese hackers were
behind Byzantine Hades attacks, according
to the April 2009 State Department cable.
As a case study, the cable cites a 10-month
investigation by a group of computer experts
at the University of Toronto which focused
in part on cyber-intrusions aimed at Tibetan
groups, including the office of the exiled
Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India.
Referencing the Canadian research, the
cable notes that infected computers in the
Dalai Lama's office communicated with
control servers previously used to attack
Tibetan targets during the 2008 Olympics
in Beijing. Two Web sites linked to the attack
also communicated with the control server.

TARGETS DETAILED

The same sites had also been involved in
Byzantine Hades attacks on U.S. government
computers in 2006, according to "sensitive
reports" cited in the cable -- likely a
euphemistic reference to secret intelligence
reporting.
The computer-snooping code that the
intrusion unleashed was known as the
Gh0stNet Remote Access Tool (RAT). It "can
capture keystrokes, take screen shots, install
and change files, as well as record sound with
a connected microphone and video with a
connected webcam," according to the cable.
Gh0st RAT succeeded in invading at least
one State Department computer. It "has
been identified in incidents -- believed to
be the work of (Byzantine Hades) actors -affecting a locally employed staff member at
the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Japan," according
to the cable.
Evidence that data was being sucked
out of a target network by malicious code
also appears to have led cyber-security
investigators to a specific hacker, affiliated
with the Chinese government, who was
conducting cyber-espionage in the United
States. A March, 2009 cable identifies him

of cyber-espionage.
In a private meeting of U.S., German,
French, British and Dutch officials held at
Ramstein Air Base in September 2008,
German officials said such computer attacks
targeted every corner of the German market,
including "the military, the economy, science
and technology, commercial interests, and
research and development," and increase
"before major negotiations involving German
and Chinese interests," according to a cable
from that year.
French officials said at the meeting that
they "believed Chinese actors had gained
access to the computers of several highlevel French officials, activating microphones
and Web cameras for the purpose of
eavesdropping," the cable said.

with China, which intensified after the major
Google hack was disclosed in January 2010,
according to U.S. officials involved in the
talks. Even before the Google hack, Chinese
officials had recognized the problem as well.
In mid-2009, representatives of the China
Institutes for Contemporary International
Relations, a nominally-independent research
group affiliated with China's Ministry of
State Security, contacted James A. Lewis, a
former U.S. diplomat now with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
Lewis said that in his first meeting with
his Chinese counterparts, a representative
of the China Institutes asked: "Why does the
Western press always blame China (for cyberattacks)?" Lewis says he replied: "Because
it's true."
There was no response to request for
comment on the talks from the Chinese
embassy in Washington.
Preliminary meetings at CSIS have
blossomed into three formal meetings in
Washington and Beijing over the last 14
months. According to two participants,
the talks continue to be marked by "a lot
of suspicion." Attendees have focused on
establishing a common understanding of
cyber-related military, law enforcement
and trade issues. Cyber-espionage isn't

being discussed directly, according to one
participant, because "the Chinese go rigid"
when the subject is raised.
One reason: for China, digital espionage
is wrapped into larger concerns about
how to keep China's economy, the world's
second largest, growing. "They've identified
innovation as crucial to future economic
growth -- but they're not sure they can do
it," says Lewis. "The easiest way to innovate
is to plagiarize" by stealing U.S. intellectual
property, he adds.
There have been a few breakthroughs.
U.S. and Chinese government officials from
law enforcement, intelligence, military and
diplomatic agencies have attended in the
wings of each discussion. "The goal has been
to get both sides on the same page," says
Lewis. "We're building the groundwork for
official discussions."
A former senior national security official
who has also attended the talks says, "Our
reports go straight to the top policymakers"
in the Obama administration.
Chinese participants have sought to allay
U.S. concerns about a Chinese cyber-attack on
the U.S. financial system. With China owning
more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. government
debt, Lewis says China's representatives

markets would, in effect, be an attack on
China's economy, itself.
Despite the talks, suspected Chinese cyberespionage has hardly tapered off. Documents
reviewed by Reuters show that CSIS itself
recently was the target of a spear-phish
containing malicious code with a suspected
link to China.
On March 1, an email sent from an address
on an unofficial U.S. Armed Forces family
welfare network called AFGIMail was sent
to Andrew Schwartz, chief spokesman for
CSIS. Attached to the message was an Excel
spreadsheet labeled "Titan Global Invitation
List."
An analysis conducted for Reuters by a
cyber-security expert who asked not to be
identified shows the email may have been
sent from a compromised AFGIMail email
server. The Excel spreadsheet, if opened,
installs malicious code which searches
for documents on the victim's computer.
The code then communicates to a Website hosting company in Orange County,
California that has additional sites in China.
