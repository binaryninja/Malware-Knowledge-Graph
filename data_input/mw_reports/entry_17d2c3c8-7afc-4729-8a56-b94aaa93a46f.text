Fuying Lab

1. Summary of the event
Recently, NSFOCUS Fuying Lab has captured a large number of phishing file attacks against
Ukraine, and the associated malicious files include pdf, doc, cpl, lnk and other types. After
analysis, we confirmed that this series of fishing activities came from the APT organization
Lorec53 (Chinese name: Lori Xiong). During the period from the end of 2021 to February 2022,
the organization used a variety of attack methods to deliver a variety of phishing documents to key
state institutions such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Finance, embassies, state-owned
enterprises, and public medical facilities of Ukraine to collect organizational Personnel
information-based network attack activities.

2. Organizational Background
Lorec53 (Chinese name: Lori Xiong) is a new type of APT organization first identified and named
by NSFOCUS Fuying Laboratory, active in Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian Computer Emergency
Response Center identified the organization as UAC-0056 in a recent report
(https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419). Fuying Lab found that the group's captureable spy Trojans
first appeared in 2020, and began to organize large-scale cyber espionage attacks against Ukraine
and Georgia in early 2021.
Lorec53 exposed a large number of Russian hacker characteristics in terms of attack tools, domain
name registration information, asset location, etc., and its attack targets are also closely related to
Russia's national interests. A study of Lorec53's development trajectory found that the
organization was suspected of being employed by other high-level espionage organizations to gain
revenue by undertaking state-level espionage attacks or selling confidential government
documents.
Lorec53 has strong infiltration ability and changeable attack methods. It can organize large-scale
and high-density phishing attacks. It is also good at learning from other organizations' social
engineering technology and network resource management methods.
At present, the victims affected by the Lorec53 attack include users of the National Bank of Iran,
Georgia's Epidemic Prevention and Health Department, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, the
Presidential Office, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Border Guard.
For more reports related to the organization, please refer to the analysis report of Fuying Lab on
the organization (http://blog.nsfocus.net/lorec-53/, http://blog.nsfocus.net/lorec53-nsfocus/ ,

3. Overview of events
1/12

Lorec53's current round of attacks lasted for a long time, with a wide range of targets, and the
attack methods had obvious organizational characteristics.
Lorec53 continued the previous decoy design methods in this round of attacks, constructing
phishing including Ukrainian government documents that mask some information, shortcut files
with Ukrainian titles and camouflaged extensions, and cpl files with Ukrainian file names. bait,
and distribute these bait masquerading as a member of a credible organization.

Table 3.1 Some fishing lures names and translations

In this series of phishing attacks, Lorec53 attackers mainly used three domain names, 3237.site,
stun.site, and eumr.site, as download servers for various phishing files. The site domain is one of
the commonly used domains of Lorec53. As of February 11, some URLs are still accessible and can
deliver payload files, indicating that this round of attacks is still ongoing.
In this series of attacks, Lorec53 directly wrote the collected mailboxes of key Ukrainian facilities
into the decoy text. Judging from Lorec53's past behavior, such an operation may be used to
increase the credibility of the bait. This feature also provides a basis for investigators to confirm
the attack coverage.
This time, Lorec53 still uses known Trojan programs, including LorecDocStealer (also known as
OutSteel), LorecCPL, SaintBot, and packaged these Trojan programs as much as possible.

4. Event Analysis

2/12

4.1 Attack event one
First from phishing attacks occurred in late 2021, Lorec53 constructed a lot to "до рішення Ради
національної безпеки і оборони України від 7 вересня 2021 року" Про внесення зміни до
персональних спеціальних економічних та інших обмежувальних заходів (санкцій) "" the
title of the fishing documentation. The contents of these phishing documents refer to a presidential
decree adopted by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on September 7, 2021,
claiming that special asset restrictions and sanctions will be imposed on a specific person.

Figure 4.1 Phishing document titled “Restrictions (sanctions) on modification of personal special economics”

According to the relevant decrees of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Security Service, the Cabinet and other
state departments can modify the document "Restriction Measures (Sanctions) for Individual
Special Economics and Others" to add or delete specific economic sanctions. In the amendment on
September 7, the economic sanctions object numbered 85 was added.
It should be noted that the content of the phishing file is roughly the same as the content of the
attachment in the presidential decree published by the Ukrainian government
(https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/n0062525-21#Text), but the Lorec53 attacker The
following changes have been made to the text:
1. The use of asterisks obscures specific citizen information;
This is Lorec53's usual practice when building phishing documents, in this way to lure victims to
enable the editing function of the document, and then run the macro code in the document

3/12

2. Added email addresses that do not exist in the original text;
The Lorec53 attacker added government email addresses to the original citizen information
without fuzzing. After query, the "DMYTROTSAN@ukr.net" address in the sample fishing email
does not matter, but point to the Ukrainian Wolin Treasury (головне управління державної
клужбееіккїї у уобииііііни у іііі їїїїл іі).
The above two changes indicate that the target of Lorec53's phishing operation is the Ukrainian
government, and the email address in the phishing email is likely to be the same as the victim's
email address. Fuying Lab counted the mailbox information in all captured phishing emails to
evaluate the impact of this Lorec53 phishing attack.

Table 4.1 Email addresses and corresponding organizations in phishing emails

The associated information of these email addresses shows that the main goal of Lorec53 in this
phishing attack is early detection and information collection, which is the same as the
organization's previous activities.

6/12

The malicious macro in these phishing documents will download and run the Trojan at
http[:]//3237[.]site/test01.exe. Also associated with this domain is a phishing shortcut file named
"Особливі документи СБУ.lnk" (a special file of the Ukrainian Security Service.lnk), and a known
Lorec53 Trojan named "08-2021.cpl" LorecCPL, so The direct correlation of this domain name to
Lorec53 can be confirmed.

Figure 4.2 The main logic part of the LorecCPL Trojan

A malicious shortcut file named "Особливі документи СБУ.lnk" was also used by Lorec53 in
several attacks. Lorec53 constructs named "sadovska-iiutg.ua.zip", "feukslpost.mil.gov.ua.zip",
"n.lashevychdirekcy.atom.gov.ua.zip", "feukslpost.mil.gov.ua. zip”, etc., and put this malicious
shortcut file in the same folder as a large number of non-toxic decoy files, expecting the victim to
run the malicious file while browsing file by file. This baiting method also fits with Lorec53's
historical approach.

7/12

Figure 4.3 Decoy zip file directory, red is the malicious shortcut file

From the name of the compressed package, it can be seen that the target of this attack is similar to
and partially overlapped with the aforementioned personal economic sanctions phishing
document, which can be speculated to be the same series of attacks.

4.2 Attack event 2
Another phishing attack occurred between December 2021 and February 2022.
In early February, Lorec53 produced a series of phishing documents with the theme of
"Повідомлення про вчинення злочину" (criminal report), which were delivered in the form of
pdf vulnerability files and docx malicious macro files.
The phishing document named "Повідомлення про вчинення злочину.pdf" (criminal
report.pdf) displayed the words "please update" when opened.

8/12

Figure 4.4 Phishing document titled "Crime Report"

This is the commonly used pdf decoy construction method for Lorec53, the file is used to download
the link
https[:]//get.adobe.com.uk.reader.updateadobeacrobatreaderdc.stun[.]site/get.adobe.com.uk.reader/
Trojan programs corresponding to
get.adobe.com.uk.reader/get.adobe.com.uk.reader/AdobeAcrobatUpdate.exe. The trojan is a
packaged LorecDocStealer (also known as OutSteel) trojan, which is used to steal various
document files on the victim's host. The shell wrapping technique used by Lorec53 on this Trojan
is very common in AgentTesla spyware.
A similar phishing document "Повідомлення про вчинення злочину (Білоус Олексій
Сергійович).docx" was opened to display images and textual information with obvious Lorec53
lure build characteristics.

9/12

Figure 4.5 Phishing document titled “Crime Report (Belous Alexei Sergeevich)”

The document is disguised as a document of the investigation department of the Ukrainian
National Police. By blocking the image and red prompt information, it induces the victim to click
the icon ole object in the document, and then execute the js script, download and run
https[:]//cdn.discordapp[.] Trojan in
com/attachments/932413459872747544/938291977735266344/putty.exe. The Trojan is also the
packaged LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) Trojan.

10/12

With reference to the aforementioned attack incident, the unobfuscated email address
o.bilous@ukrtransnafta.com in this document may be the email address of the direct victims of
this incident. The affiliate company of this mailbox is UKRTRANSNAFT Joint Stock Company of
Ukraine.
In addition, the docx phishing document was also captured and published by the Ukrainian
Computer Emergency Response Center (CERT-UA). In related reports
(https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419), CERT-UA referred to the Lorec53 organization as the UAC0056.
Through correlation analysis of the stun.site domain name that appeared in this attack, Fuying Lab
confirmed a variety of decoy files released by Lorec53 from December 2021. These files include
.lnk, .cpl, .rar and other formats, all of which are known decoy forms of Lorec53. The main
function is to obtain and run the subsequent LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) Trojan from stun.site.

4.3 Attack event 3
The third attack incident mainly revolved around the domain name eumr[.]site.
In early 2, Lorec53 structure called "Роз'яснення щодо коректності ведення електронних
медичних записів в електронній системі охорони здоров'я, а також впливу прави" (electronic
medical system to clarify the validity of electronic medical records, as well as the impact of the law)
bait , delivered in the form of a zip archive. Based on the name of the decoy, it can be speculated
that the file comes from an attack campaign against the Ukrainian medical system, which overlaps
with previous Lorec53 targets.
The malicious shortcut file in the compressed package is a typical Lorec53 phishing lure, used to
download and run the Trojan program located at http[:]//eumr[.]site/up74987340.exe, which is
the LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) spy Trojan.
The file properties show that these decoy files were modified on January 31, 2022.
The domain names and CnC communication addresses that appeared in this incident can be linked
to a number of other malicious programs, which are various forms of wrappers for the
LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) spyware.

V. Summary
The multiple attacks discovered this time are all part of the large-scale cyber attack activities
carried out by Lorec53 (Lori Bear) in different time periods from the end of 2021 to February 2022
against Ukrainian government departments, the military, and state-owned enterprises. The main
targets of these attacks are still early detection and information collection, and they show the
distinctive characteristics of Lorec53 at various stages.
The phishing lures captured this time show that Lorec53 has indeed inherited the organization's
mercenary hacking characteristics when operating a national-level cyber attack campaign. Lorec53
will batch-produce and regularly adjust the content of phishing bait, with flexible download server

11/12

addresses and CnC addresses, to indiscriminately harass and attack the exposed mailboxes of key
Ukrainian institutions. This large-scale attack idea is similar to Lorec53's early operation idea as
an email botnet operator.
With the changes in the situation in Eastern Europe, the activity of cyber espionage activities
against Ukraine has increased significantly recently, and Fuying Lab will continue to pay attention
to the progress of the activities of the Lorec53 organization.
