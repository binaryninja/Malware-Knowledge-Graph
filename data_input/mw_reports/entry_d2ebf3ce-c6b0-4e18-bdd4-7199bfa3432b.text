U.S. Victims of Various Cybercriminal Malware Schemes throughout
the United States Had Stolen Multi-Million Dollar Funds Laundered
by QQAAZZ
Fourteen members of the transnational criminal organization, QQAAZZ, were charged by a
federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania in an indictment unsealed today. A
related indictment unsealed in October 2019 charged five members of QQAAZZ. One
additional conspirator, a Russian national, was arrested by criminal complaint in late March
2020 while visiting the United States, bringing the total number of charged defendants to 20.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the U.S. Department of Justice’s
Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
made the announcement today.

The QQAAZZ members, acting in concert with cybercriminals across the world, are accused
of conspiring to launder money stolen from victims of computer fraud in the United States
and elsewhere. More than 40 house searches were conducted in Latvia, Bulgaria, the
United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, with criminal prosecutions initiated in the United States,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. The largest number of searches and arrests were
carried out in Latvia by the Latvian State Police (Latvijas Valsts Policija), and an extensive
bitcoin mining operation associated with the group was seized in Bulgaria. Today’s
announcement is in coordination with announcements by Europol and several law
enforcement agencies across Europe who collaborated with the United States to develop
parallel investigations and prosecutions of the QQAAZZ members in their own countries.
“Today’s charges, brought in coordination with our European law enforcement partners,
reflect the Criminal Division’s steadfast efforts to work with authorities worldwide toprotect
the public from fraudsters and the money launderers who help them hide their stolen money,”
said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt. “Our message to money laundering
organizations like QQAAZZ is simple: internationalborders will not stop the dedicated efforts
of law enforcement across the globe to bring you to justice. In addition to the Criminal
Division team, I would like to recognize the outstanding efforts of the team led by U.S.
Attorney Scott Brady, FBI Pittsburgh, and our European partners.”
“Cybercrime victimizes individuals and companies all over the world, so our work to identify
and disrupt cybercriminals requires global collaboration,” said U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady
for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “For the past several years, law enforcement from
16 countries has been conducting coordinated investigations of this criminal gang, and now
parallel prosecutions will commence in the United States, Portugal, United Kingdom and
Spain. As this case demonstrates, we will be relentless in our pursuit of cybercriminals
regardless of where they reside.”
“This was an extensive investigation that had implications around the world,” said FBI
Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Michael Christman. “Partnerships are essential, as no
one agency can combat cybercrime alone. This case highlights the FBI’s strategy to target
and dismantle the most significant cybercriminal enterprises through a global task force
approach. I can assure everyone that the FBI and our partners will continue to work tirelessly
to combat these cyber threats.”
“Cybercriminals are constantly exploring new possibilities to abuse technology and financial
frameworks to victimize millions of users in a moment from anywhere in the world,” said
Fernando Ruiz, Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre. “Today’s operation shows
how through a proper law enforcement international coordination we can turn the table on
these criminals and bring them to justice.”
The indictment alleges that the QQAAZZ network laundered, or attempted to launder, tens of
millions of dollars’ worth of stolen funds from victims of cybercrimes since 2016.

Comprised of several layers of members from Latvia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, and
Belgium, among other countries, the QQAAZZ network opened and maintained hundreds of
corporate and personal bank accounts at financial institutions throughout the world to receive
money from cybercriminals who stole it from bank accounts of victims. The funds were then
transferred to other QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts and sometimes converted to
cryptocurrency using “tumbling” services designed to hide the original source of the funds.
After taking a fee of up to 40 to 50 percent, QQAAZZ returned the balance of the stolen
funds to their cybercriminal clientele.
The QQAAZZ members secured these bank accounts by using both legitimate and
fraudulent Polish and Bulgarian identification documents to create and register dozens of
shell companies which conducted no legitimate business activity. Using these registration
documents, the QQAAZZ members then opened corporate bank accounts in the names of
the shell companies at numerous financial institutions around the world, thereby generating
hundreds of QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts available to receive stolen funds from cyber
thieves.
QQAAZZ advertised its services as a “global, complicit bank drops service” on Russianspeaking online cybercriminal forums where cybercriminals gather to offer or seek
specialized skills or services needed to engage in a variety of cybercriminal activities. The
criminal gangs behind some of the world’s most harmful malware families (e.g.: Dridex,
Trickbot, GozNym, etc.) are among those cybercriminal groups that benefited from the
services provided by QQAAZZ.

from Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Latvia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Italy, Switzerland,
Poland, Czech Republic, Australia, Sweden, Austria, Germany and Belgium. Acting
Assistant Attorney General Rabbitt and U.S. Attorney Brady also thanked Europol in The
Hague, Netherlands for coordinating the investigative efforts of the law enforcement

International Affairs of the Department’s Criminal Division provided significant assistance by
coordinating requests to foreign countries for searches, arrests, extraditions and evidence
sharing. Assistance was also provided by the National Cyber-Forensics and Training
Alliance (NCFTA) in Pittsburgh.
