Crimson RAT

Transparent Tribe is an Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) group that has been active
since 2013. Also known as PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD, the group is highly
active and has been engaged in conducting various cyber espionage campaigns.
The APT group is suspected to be politically motivated, as its victims include defense and
diplomatic professionals. One of the tools used in its campaigns is a .NET RAT (Remote
Access Trojan) also known as Crimson RAT. The group was seen to be operating with
an updated version of Crimson RAT discovered recently, consisting of a malicious macro
embedded in a word file that upon execution drops a payload to set up a communication
channel with a Command-and-Control Server (C2/C&C Server).
Table 1 consists of details of Transparent Tribe.

Case 1:
Transparent Tribes’ campaigns begin with the delivery of a malicious document file
on the targeted victim system, and upon
opening the malcrafted document that has embedded macro, users receive a notification
regarding a security concern and are instructed to give a consent for enabling the content.
Figure 2 depicts the word file embedded with malicious macro.

Figure 2: Malicious word file
As the infection flow starts off from the execution of the word macro, we were on the lookout
for more information regarding the malicious macro. As
per OLE Object analysis, the Autoexecution of the Document_open function leads
to the payload delivery and its subsequent execution on the victim’s machine.
Figure 3 showcases the keywords extracted from the malicious word macro.

In Figure 4, we can see that the name of the payload file is dubbed as “railthnsrqn” in the
macro, along with the use of ALLUSERPROFILE variable, which indicates that the payload
might get dropped in C:\ProgramData.

Figure 4: File creation
The macro checks for the OS (Operating System) version, and based on whether it is 32-bit
or 64-bit, it accordingly selects the payload.

The payload gets executed after it’s dropped using shell command.

Figure 6: Execution of the payload (railthnsrqn.exe).
Case 2:
During our research, we also found a different execution technique used by the Crimson
RAT to execute its payload. This technique does not use word macros, but a binary
executable file that has an embedded word document (containing a CV file). Upon execution,
it opens the embedded word document and silently executes its payload in the background.

Technical analysis Case 1:
Upon behavioral analysis, it was verified that the payload file named railthnsrqn.exe was
dropped and executed after enabling the macro.

Figure 10: Process flow of railthnsrqn.exe
Upon analyzing the network traffic, we found that multiple TCP requests were made to
167.160.166.177, which turns out to be the C&C server.

We found the following hardcoded port numbers during the decompilation of railthnsrqn.exe.

The image below showcases the code used by the payload to exfiltrating the data.

In Figure 15, we can see the code that has been written to make changes into the registry for
persistance and to autostart the malware payload.

Technical analysis Case 2:
The Figure 16 depicts the execution of payload file (othvidtiraw.exe) in the background.

Figure 16: Execution of payload(othvidtiraw.exe)
We can see in the figure below that the payload is trying to connect to Command and Control
(C2) server and is also accessing the registry for persistence.

Table 2: MITRE ATT&CK mapping
The Transparent Tribe APT group has been actively exploiting its target using an updated
tool set. In the past, we have seen them successfully carrying out their
campaigns on defense and diplomatic personnel. The use of new attack techniques helps an
attacker to evade security mechanisms, thereby establishing more persistence on the victim
network. Individuals are advised to enhance security controls to overcome these new TTPs
used by hackers. So far, we have not heard of Transparent Tribe exploiting general public,
however, most of victims of the APT group seem to have some relation with Afghanistan or
India.
Cyble will continue to track APT activities to collect advanced threat intelligence related
to such campaigns.
