ransomware operations

An alleged member of one of the most notorious ransomware gangs in the world divulged
numerous details about its operation, including that it allegedly takes in more than $100
million per year from its attacks.
The figure was revealed during an interview with an alleged representative of the REvil group
that was released on Oct. 23, 2020. The interview, conducted by a Russian cybersecurity
researcher and posted on the YouTube channel RussianOSINT, covered the group's prior
attacks, how it splits its profits, and various tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) the
group uses to conduct its attacks.
REvil has been one of the most active ransomware gangs in recent memory, claiming
responsibility for such attacks as those on U.K.-based financial service provider Travelex,
U.S.-based entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks and 23 local
governments in Texas.
The representative interviewed told host Sergey RedHunt that the malware was created from
the source code of a separate, defunct ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) where core REvil
members previously were affiliates. When that RaaS variant was shut down, the actors
behind REvil purchased the source code and developed their own ransomware. He also
claimed that REvil has 10 developers that keep it running.
While the group carries out attacks on its own, it has found the RaaS model brings back more
money. Affiliates are responsible for gaining access to target networks, downloading valuable
files and deploying the actual ransomware, while the REvil gang handles victim negotiations
and blackmailing, ransom collection and distribution. This model has apparently led to
skyrocketing profits: according to the REvil representative, one affiliate's earnings rose from
about US $20,000 to US $30,000 per target with another RaaS offering to about US $7
million to $8 million per target in only six months after joining forces with REvil.
One of the most common ways the group gains access to organizations is through remote
desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, such as the BlueGate vulnerability, which allows
remote code execution by an authorized user. The representative admittedly preferred to use
information stealers to obtain remote access credentials, which are then used to secure an
initial foothold in company networks. In the case of the Travelex and Grubman Shire

Meiselas & Sacks attacks, the representative said networks were compromised by exploiting
outdated Citrix and Pulse Secure remote access software, with the actors allegedly gaining
access to an entire network in "about three minutes."
The representative claimed that most desirable targets for attacks were agriculture
companies, insurance companies, internet service providers, law firms and manufacturers.
He also claimed that most victims pay the ransom to avoid having their data dumped online
rather than just to decrypt the files. According to the representative, there were only 12 cases
when the gang could not decrypt files, due to them being corrupted by victims looking to
recover them by using third-party or antivirus software. The REvil team allegedly did not
take ransom payments in these cases.
REvil has also allegedly taken precautions against attempts by cybersecurity researchers or
law enforcement to infiltrate the group or take down its infrastructure. The gang has
introduced additional protection measures and vetted new affiliates by asking general
political and social questions related to former Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries that only native Russian speakers typically could answer. Russian-speaking
infiltrators usually were vetted by asking specific technical questions about attack techniques.
The gang is also aware that cybersecurity experts and vendors often tried to penetrate the
group's resources, allegedly identifying attempts to exploit cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities. All the attacks allegedly were unsuccessful.
The interview supports a number of trends Intel 471 has been tracking among prominent
RaaS crews, including affiliate payout structures, the relationship between ransomware
gangs and information stealers, the growing push to expose private information if ransoms
are not paid, and other ties to popular forums in the criminal underground.
Intel 471 will soon be releasing a three-part series that examines the impact of gangs like
REvil amid the onslaught of RaaS-based attacks over the past year. The series will cover the
explosion in the affiliate model, the relationship between actors selling access to enterprises
and how it portends ransomware attacks, and what happens inside businesses when an
attack occurs.
