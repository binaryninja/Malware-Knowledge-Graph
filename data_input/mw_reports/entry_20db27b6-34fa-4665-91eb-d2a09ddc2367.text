Introduction
Recently Zscaler ThreatLabz observed a Grandoreiro campaign targeting organizations in
the Spanish-speaking nations of Mexico and Spain that work across a variety of different
industry verticals such as Automotive, Chemicals Manufacturing and others. In this
campaign, the threat actors impersonate government officials from the Attorney General’s
Office of Mexico City and from the Public Ministry in the form of spear-phishing emails in
order to lure victims to download and execute “Grandoreiro” a prolific banking trojan that
has been active since at least 2016, and that specifically targets users in Latin America.
Grandoreiro is written in Delphi and utilizes techniques like binary padding to inflate
binaries, Captcha implementation for sandbox evasion, and command-and-control (CnC)
communication using patterns that are identical to LatentBot.
Key Features of this Attack:
Grandoreiro targets organizations in the Spanish-speaking nations of Mexico and
Spain across various industry verticals
The threat actors in this campaign impersonate Mexican Government Officials
Multiple anti-analysis techniques are used by Grandoreiro Loader along with
implementation of Captcha for evading Sandboxes
The Grandoreiro Loader sends across a Check-In Request with all the required User,
System and Campaign information

1/25

The Grandoreiro uses a binary padding technique to evade sandboxes, adding
multiple BMP images to the resource section of the binary and inflating the size to
400+ MB
The CnC Communication pattern of 2022 Grandoreiro is now completely identical to
the LatentBot with “ACTION=HELLO” beacon and ID based communication
In-depth analysis of the Grandoreiro campaign and corresponding Infection chain has been
explained below.
Campaign Details:
ThreatLabz has analyzed multiple infection chains for this Grandoreiro campaign, which
began in June 2022 and is still ongoing. Based on our analysis, we can infer that the threat
actors in this case are attempting to target organizations in the Spanish-speaking
countries of Mexico and Spain. Industries targeted in this campaign include:
Chemicals Manufacturing
Automotive
Civil and Industrial Construction
Machinery
Logistics - Fleet management services

Infection Chain:
2/25

The infection chain employed by the threat actors in this campaign is quite similar to
previous Grandoreiro campaigns. It begins with a spear-phishing email written in Spanish,
targeting victims in Mexico and Spain. The email consists of an embedded link which when
clicked redirects the victim to a website that further downloads a malicious ZIP archive on
the victim's machine. The ZIP archive is bundled with the Grandoreiro Loader module with a
PDF Icon in order to lure the victim into execution; this is responsible for downloading,
extracting and executing the final 400MB “Grandoreiro” payload from a Remote HFS server
which further communicates with the CnC Server using traffic identical to LatentBot

Fig 2. Infection Chain
Let’s dive into the spear-phishing emails received by the victims. The phishing emails are
divided into two sets based on the lures used by the threat actors.
Set I - Impersonating Government Officials - Provisional Archiving Resolution:
The first set of phishing emails observed during the campaign were those in which the
threat actors impersonated Government officials, instructing the victims to download and
share the Provisional Archiving Resolution. Below are the details of the phishing emails:
1.)
Subject (Spanish) : Fiscalia General del Gobierno (RESOLUCIÓN13062022)
Subject (English) : Government Attorney General (RESOLUTION 13062022)

3/25

Fig 3. Phishing Email - Fiscalia General del Gobierno
As can be seen in the above screenshot, the threat actors are posing as the current
Attorney General of Mexico “Alejandro Gertz Manero” The email subject and the signature
are of the Attorney General’s Office “Fiscalia General de Justicia'' making the email seem
legit. The content in this case notifies the victims about the Provisional Archiving Resolution
and asks them to download and share the Resolution before a specified date, after which
the payment would not be refunded. If the victim clicks on the embedded link to download
the resolution, it redirects to a malicious domain: http[:]//barusgorlerat[.]me as shown in
the screenshot, and then downloads a ZIP file from the remote server consisting of the
Grandoreiro Loader.

2.)
We also came across a similar lure where the threat actors masquerade as “Alejandra
Solano - from the Public Ministry - Early Decision and Litigation Section” and ask the Victim
to download and share the Provisional Archiving Resolution. In this case, the embedded
link redirects to another domain: http[:]//damacenapirescontab[.]com as shown in the
screenshot below.
Subject (Spanish) :RV [EXTERNAL] Notificación del Ministerio Público - MP08062022
3:59:54 PM
Subject (English) : RV [EXTERNAL] Notification of the Public Ministry - MP08062022
3:59:54 PM

4/25

Fig 4. Phishing Email 2
Set II - Cancellation of Mortgage Loan and Deposit Voucher Slip
In this set, there are two types of phishing email lures. The first is regarding the cancellation
of a mortgage loan, in which the threat actors ask the victim to download a mortgage
cancellation form by opening the embedded link as shown in the below screenshot. Once
the link is opened it redirects to the malicious domain: http[:]//assesorattlas[.]me which
then further downloads a ZIP File consisting of the Grandoreiro Loader.
Subject (Spanish) : Hola agonzaleza Baja del préstamo hipotecario 12:05:38 PM
Subject (English) : Hi Agonz, Low Mortgage Loan 12:05:38 PM

Fig 5. Phishing Email - Cancellation of Mortgage Loan

5/25

The second one consists of two similar emails targeted towards two different organizations
in Mexico. Here, the victim is asked to download a deposit voucher/slip by clicking on the
hyperlink. Once the link is opened, it downloads a ZIP File consisting of the Grandoreiro
Loader from http[:]//assesorattlas[.]me and http[:]//perfomacepnneu[.]me as shown in
the below screenshot.
Subject (Spanish) : Sr.(a) alfonso.vera Comprobante deposito 05-Jul-22 8:06:09 PM
Subject (English) : Sr. (a) alfonso.vera Proof of deposit 05-Jul-22 8:06:09 PM
Subject (Spanish) : RV Comprobante deposito 28-jun-22 5:11:45 PM
Subject (English) : RV Deposit voucher 28-jun-22 5:11:45 PM

Fig 6. Phishing Email - Proof of Deposit

After analyzing all the phishing emails in our dataset, we were able to establish a common
pattern between the emails on the basis of similar content to lure the victims, and the
pattern of the embedded links (Pattern: domain.tld/?timestamp), sometimes seen along
with targeted countries (domain.tld/country/?timestamp) that were used to download the
Grandoreiro Loader from the remote HFS server.

6/25

Fig 7. Phishing Email - Pattern Analysis

By observing this pattern, we can state that the Grandoreiro campaign might be conducted
by a single threat actor across various organizations in Mexico and Spain. The pattern can
also be beneficial to track other related campaigns as well.
Once the victim clicks on the embedded link, the user is redirected to download a ZIP File
onto the machine from the following different URLs where all the downloaded files drop the
Grandoreiro Loader. The file names correspond to the email lures being used:
35[.]181[.]59[.]254/info99908hhzzb.zip
35[.]180[.]117[.]32/$FISCALIGENERAL3489213839012
35[.]181[.]59[.]254/$FISCALIGE54327065410839012?id_JIBBRS=DR-307494
52[.]67[.]27[.]173/deposito(1110061313).zip
54.232.38.61/notificacion(flfit48202).zip
54.232.38.61/notificacion(egmux24178).zip

Next, let’s examine the ZIP File named “informacion16280LIFSD.zip” which is
downloaded from the following remote server
35[.]180[.]117[.]32/$FISCALIGENERAL3489213839012 once the victim clicks on the
embedded link in the Spear phishing email.
The ZIP archive bundles two files:
A31136.xml
infonpeuz52271VVCYX.exe

7/25

Fig 8. Downloaded ZIP Archive
In this case, the first file A31136.xml is not a XML file but a portable executable with the
original name “Extensions.dll” and signed with a valid “ASUSTEK COMPUTER
INCORPORATION” certificate. It is benign in nature as shown in the screenshot below, and
never loaded by the Loader module.

Fig 9. Extensions.dll
The second file bundled inside the ZIP archive “infonpeuz52271VVCYX.exe” is the
Grandoreiro Loader module written in Delphi and masking itself with a PDF Icon compiled
on 14th June 2022 in order to lure the victims into execution, as shown in the screenshot
below.

8/25

Fig 10. Grandoreiro Loader Module
When the loader module is executed by the victim, it initially creates a Mutex
“[email protected]” by calling CreateMutexA()

Fig 11. Creates Mutex
Then it loads the “TForm1” Class Object from the resource section “RCData”, and the forms
in Delphi are defined by the TForm class itself.

Fig 12. Loads the TForm1 Class Object
Further, the loader module performs the following anti-analysis checks before executing the
critical functions.

9/25

i) Detect Analysis Tools: The malware detects the below mentioned analysis tools by
decrypting the tool names using a XOR-based Decryption routine. It then takes a snapshot
of currently executing processes in the system using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() and
walks through the process list using Process32First() and Process32Next(). If any of the
analysis tools exist, the malware execution is terminated.

Filemon.exe

Procmon.exe

Wireshark.exe

Procexp64.exe

Procexp.exe

ProcessHacker.exe

PCHunter64.exe

PCHunter32.exe

JoeTrace.exe

Fig 13. List of Detected Analysis Tools
The second method that the malware uses to detect the analysis tools is to compare the
text of the window names with analysis tools (including TCPView and RegShot in this case)
by using GetWindowTextW(), FindWindowW, and EnumWindows() APIs.
ii) Detect Execution Directory: In this case, the malware checks the directory in which it is
being executed. If the below mentioned directory names are used, it terminates itself with a
comparison logic in place.

C:\insidetm
C:\analysis

10/25

Fig 14. Detection of Execution Directory
iii) Anti-Debug Technique: In this case, the Grandoreiro executes the IsDebuggerPresent()
to determine whether the current process is being executed in the context of a debugger. If
the result is non-zero, the malware terminates itself as shown below in the screenshot.

Fig 15. IsDebuggerPresent() Anti-Debug Technique
iv) Vmware I/O Port Anti-VM Technique: In this case, the malware checks whether the
execution is occurring in a virtual environment (Vmware) by reading data from the I/O Port
“0x5658h” (VX) used by Vmware. It achieves this by setting up the registers in the following
format as shown below in the screenshot.

Fig 16. Vmware I/O Port Anti-VM Technique
If, after execution of “in” instruction (executed in order to pull data from the port “VX”) the
EBX register consists of the magic Number “VMXh” the malware is executed in a virtualized
environment and thus further terminates itself.

11/25

After completing the anti-analysis checks, the malware decrypts a URL by passing an
encrypted string to the string decryption routine. The string decryption routine performs
XOR-based decryption with the following key as shown in the screenshot below.

Fig 17. Download Server URL decryption via XOR-based String decryption routine
This string decryption routine has been used previously in the older variants of Grandoreiro
for decrypting strings and API calls in order to evade detection. The Grandoreiro string
decryptor can be found here, developed by the SpiderLabs Team at TrustWave.
The Grandoreiro Loader then sends across a GET Request to the previously decrypted
URL: “http[:]//15[.]188[.]63[.]127/$TIME” which provides in response the URL to download
the next stage as seen below.

Fig 18. Acquiring Final Payload Download URL

Next, the malware executes the URLDownloadToFile() API function with the szURL
argument as the remote HFS server URL “http://15[.]188[.]63[.]127:36992/zxeTYhO.xml”
in order to download the Final Payload of the Grandoreiro Banking Trojan as shown in the
screenshot below.

12/25

Fig 19. Download Final Payload of the Grandoreiro Banking Trojan
The downloaded Grandoreiro Final Payload is a 9MB ZIP archive that is extracted
dynamically, and the bundled executable (disguised as zxeTYhO.png) inside the archive is
written in a folder whose name is generated at runtime in the “C:\ProgramData'' directory.
Also the PE file masquerading as “zxeTYhO.png” is renamed to
ASUSTek[random_string].exe, generated with a random string generation logic, and
changes on every execution.

Fig 20. Grandoreiro Final Payload renamed and written in ProgramData with random
generated folder name

13/25

Furthermore, the Stage-1 Grandoreiro module collects the following System and User
information where all the strings are decrypted at runtime via the similar String Decryption
Function.
i) Username - Retrieves Username via GetUserNameW()

Fig 21. Fetches Username
ii) ComputerName - Retrieves Computer name via GetComputerNameW

Fig 22. Fetches ComputerName
iii) Operating System and Version - Retrieves the Operating System and its version from the
Windows NT\\CurrentVersion and ProductName registry hive.

Fig 23. Fetches OS and its version
iv) Antivirus - Retrieves the Antivirus Program installed on the machine via a WMI query
shown below in the screenshot

Fig 24. Fetches Antivirus
v) Check Installed Programs - In this case the Grandoreiro module checks whether the
following programs are installed by accessing the Program Files folder (Path: C:\Program
Files\ and C:\Program Files (x86)\ ) or the AppData Folder (Path: C:\Users\

If any of the listed programs are installed on the machine, the malware stores the program
names to a list for further usage.
Once all of the above mentioned User and System information has been gathered by the
malware, it then decrypts the Check-In URL along with required parameters via the XORbased String decryption routine used previously and concatenates the parameters with the
corresponding gathered information as shown below in the screenshot.

Fig 25. Decryption and Arrangement of Check-In URL
After completion of the concatenation, the loader sends across a POST Check-In Request
to the Host: “barusgorlerat[.]me with all the gathered User, System, and Campaign
informationarranged along with the different parameters as shown and explained in the
screenshot below.
15/25

Fig 26. Check-In Request

Once the Check-In request is sent to the remote server, the loader executes the
Grandoreiro Final Payload which was downloaded, extracted, and renamed previously.
Grandoreiro - Final Payload:
The Grandoreiro Final Payload written in Delphi was downloaded previously from the
remote HFS server “http://15[.]188[.]63[.]127:36992/zxeTYhO.xml” as a 9.2 MB ZIP file
which is then extracted and executed by the Grandoreiro Loader. The extracted file is a
414MB Portable Executable file disguised with a “.png” extension which is later renamed to
“.exe” dynamically by the loader and also the final payload is signed with an “ASUSTEK
DRIVER ASSISTANTE” digital certificate to appear legitimate and evade detection.

16/25

Fig 27. Grandoreiro Final Payload Signed with ASUSTEK Certificate
As seen in the older Grandoreiro samples, a similar “Binary Padding” technique is used
here in order to inflate the file size of the binary to around 400MB by adding two ~200MB
Bitmap images in the resource section as shown in the screenshot below. This technique
works as an anti-sandbox technique as it helps in evading sandboxes as most of them have
a file size limit for execution.

17/25

Fig 28. Binary Padding used by Grandoreiro
The final payload maintains persistence on the Machine by leveraging the Run Registry key
(HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) which would allow the payload to
be executed on startup.

Fig 29. Maintain Persistence on the Machine via Run Registry Key

In the following Grandoreiro variant, the Payload writes an .ini file (Name:
ASUSTekGvaxvh.ini) in the directory of execution which consists of all the following
information as shown in the screenshot. The values in the Configuration file are encrypted
using a XOR-based Encryption routine with a key that changes in every sample.

18/25

Fig 30. INI Configuration File
The Command & Control communications have been updated from the 2020 variant.
Previously there were some similarities between the Grandoreiro and LatentBot
communications (as exhibited here), but they were not identical. However, in the latest 2022
sample, the communication pattern has been upgraded by the threat actors and now it is
completely identical to LatentBot where the name of the CnC Subdomain is generated via a
Domain Generation Algorithm just as the older Grandoreiro variants. The identical
LatentBot beacon command “ACTION=HELLO” and the ID-Based communication can be
seen in the screenshot below.

Fig 31. Grandoreiro C2 Communication - 2022

19/25

Fig 32. LatentBot C2 Communication - 2017 (Pic Credit: link)
Identical to LatentBot, the Command & Control server provides the Cookie value as a
response to the “ACTION=HELLO” beacon which is further used as an ID for
communication in the latest Grandoreiro sample, as seen in the below screenshot.

Furthermore, Grandoreiro includes the following backdoor capabilities for espionage
purposes:
Keylogging
Auto-Updation for newer versions and modules
Web-Injects and restricting access to specific websites
Command execution
Manipulating windows
Guiding the victim's browser to a certain URL
C2 Domain Generation via DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)
Imitating mouse and keyboard movements

22/25

While finalizing our article, we came across another ongoing Grandoreiro campaign with an
extra anti-sandbox technique used by the malware authors. This technique requires a
Captcha to be filled manually to execute the malware in the victim’s machine. The malware
is not executed until or unless the Captcha is filled.

Figure 35: Captcha used as Anti-sandbox technique (Pic credit: twitter)
We have analyzed the following malware in our Lab and found that the network
communication is similar to the one analyzed in the blog and it also follows
“ACTION=HELLO” beacon and ID based communication as inherited from LatentBot.

Conclusion:
The threat actors behind Grandoreiro Banking malware are continuously evolving their
tactics and malware to successfully carry out attacks against their targets by incorporating
new anti-analysis tricks to evade security solutions; inheriting features from other Malware
families. The Zscaler ThreatLabz team will continue to monitor these attacks to help keep
our customers safe
