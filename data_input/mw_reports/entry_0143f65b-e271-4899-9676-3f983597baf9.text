Emotet Maldocs

Emotet is a modular malware delivery platform that has consistently dominated the
commodity malware threat landscape over the past couple of years. It has evolved from a
straightforward banking trojan into a full-fledged malware distribution service, delivering a
variety of payloads for other threat actor groups. The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security states that Emotet infections cost state and local governments up to $1 million to
remediate. Emotet is operated by the threat group tracked as Mummy Spider.
Emotet is commonly delivered in phishing campaigns via a macro-enabled Word document. I
recently had a newer Emotet maldoc, come across my desk. The part that interested my
about this document was that the PowerShell obfuscation scheme had changed significantly

1/4

for the first time in a few months. I thought it would be worthwhile to write a quick post with a
few details about this new PowerShell script and provide a handy CyberChef recipe so that
analysts and responders could quickly decode these PowerShell Scripts.
I won’t dig as deep as I usually do here as Brad Duncan has already done a nice writeup on
this campaign over at the SANS ISC blog. If readers are interested in seeing more details
regarding dynamic analysis, I highly recommend checking it out here.
The overall infection chain in this case remains pretty much the same: a malicious Word
document that is weaponized with macros is opened, which invokes a WMI process call that
spawns a PowerShell script. That script attempts to download the core binary from a septet
of URL resources.

The Document
This document was related to the spam runs from 10/29/20 and leveraged a Halloween
Party-themed social engineering lure.
filename: Party Invitation.doc
SHA256: ed51269c3602786ff6ddef3a808d8178d26e4e5960f4ac7af765e4bd642128dd
I pulled the document down from VirusTotal. These campaigns still appear to using the
“upgrade your edition of Microsoft Word” template in order to induce the victim into enabling
macros. Much more about related campaigns is available thanks to the incredible work of the
Cryptolaemus team here.

The PowerShell script that is executed when macros are enabled is base64 encoded per
usual. Peeling back the first layer of obfuscation reveals the following:

The URLs that are hosting the next stage payload, which is the Emotet loader are
obfuscated with a string replacement operation. This is slightly more complex that in the
recent techniques, but still leverages an empty string replacement for ‘[]w’ and ‘ jjkgS []’,
while a character replacement is used to swap ‘][ 1’ for the slash ‘/’ character. At that point,
an analyst would just need to split the the string at the “@” delimeter, use a regular
expression to isolate URL patterns, and then defang for sharing.

Here is the code for the recipe in Chef format, which I also have on my GitHub:
From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)
Remove_null_bytes()
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':'+'},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':'('},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':')'},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':'\''},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':'[]w'},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':' jjkgS
[]'},'',true,false,true,false)
Find_/_Replace({'option':'Simple string','string':'][ 1'},'/',true,false,true,false)
Split('@','\\n')
Remove_whitespace(true,false,false,false,false,false)
Regular_expression('URL','([A-Za-z]+://)([-\\w]+(?:\\.\\w[-\\w]*)+)(:\\d+)?(/[^.!,?"
<>\\[\\]{}\\s\\x7F-\\xFF]*(?:[.!,?]+[^.!,?"<>\\[\\]{}\\s\\x7F\\xFF]+)*)?',true,true,false,false,false,false,'List matches')
Defang_URL(true,true,true,'Valid domains and full URLs')

This Direct Link has the recipe already preloaded in CyberChef.

Summary
So that’s it. Just a quick look at some new PowerShell obfuscation used by Mummy Spider in
recent campaigns. These tactics used to change quite frequently but the cadence of updates
has slowed considerably as of late. As always, CyberChef is my preferred tool for deobfuscating these scripts to quickly extract the network indicators of compromise in order to
increase velocity during and Incident Response investigation.
