BianLian Ransomware Expanding C2 Infrastructure and
Operational Tempo

September 2, 2022

The threat actors behind the BianLian Ransomware are rapidly expanding infrastructure, and it has
been observed targeting manufacturing organizations.

Context

1/8

On September 1, 2022, researchers at the cybersecurity firm Redacted published a technical
analysis of the BianLian ransomware. In the past month, BianLian has been observed being
deployed against numerous sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, and education. Throughout
August, Redacted researchers reported observing BianLian threat actors rapidly expanding their
command and control (C2) infrastructure and increasing their attack rate.

Technical Analysis
BianLian is written in the Go programming language, likely to frustrate reverse engineering efforts by
security researchers and to make compromising multiple platforms easier for the threat actors
deploying the ransomware.
According to Redacted researchers, the threat actor appears technically sophisticated in
compromising targeted networks, but is likely inexperienced at ransomware operations, based on the
following behaviors observed during the investigation:
Mistakenly sending data from one victim to another.
Possessing a relatively stable backdoor toolkit but have an actively developing encryption tool
with an evolving ransom note.
Long delays in communications with victims.
Through the group’s own admission on their onion site, the business side of their infrastructure
is unreliable.
Redacted researchers also noted that the BianLian threat actors targeted the ProxyShell vulnerability
chain (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) and SonicWall VPN devices to gain
initial access into victim networks. The threat actors also employ Living off the Land (LOL)
methodology to move laterally, adjusting operations based on defensive controls present on infected
networks.

Mitigation Options
Researchers with Redacted provided the following defensive measures:
An aggressive, prioritized patching regime.
Employ multi-factor authentication on every system that allows that as an option.
Visibility into your network and endpoint devices to quickly identify breaches.
Secure backups to allow return to business operations as soon as possible.
A well-practiced incident response plan, so everyone involved knows their role.
An assessment of your “Crown Jewels” that can be used to both inform your security posture
and decide ahead of an incident what data you could afford to have leaked so you can avoid
paying the ransom.
In addition to these strategic recommendations, there are multiple opportunities for behavioral
detections in the attack chain leveraged by BianLian:

2/8

Defense Evasion: Svchost not a child of services.exe
BianLian called one of their LOL tools svchost, then launched it via a process other than
services.exe.
Defense Evasion: Svchost executing from an unusual path
BianLian called one of their LOL tools svchost.exe, then executed it from a non-standard
path.
Defense Evasion: Netsh to modify firewall rules
BianLian leveraged netsh to add a firewall rule to open 3389 to Remote Desktop.
Reconnaissance: Ping -4 -n 1
BianLian used single pings to perform network reconnaissance. This is a false-positive
prone alert.
Lateral Movement: Winrm dropping a file via PowerShell
The binary wsmprovhost.exe is used to mediate the relationship between WinRM and
PowerShell. Alerting on file modification by wsmprovhost.exe proved a reliable method to
detect BianLian dropping malicious files.
Lateral Movement: Unknown Binary Established Connection on 3389
If leveraging an EDR that classifies binaries as known and unknown and ties network
connections to binaries, looking for 3389 in use by unknown binaries can be extremely
fruitful. This rule detects BianLian’s custom Go backdoor.
Credential Access: Account manipulation via net.exe
“Net user” is too loud to alert on in most environments, but we recommend alerting on a
threshold of “net user” executions. Even a threshold as high as 10 events in 15 minutes
would have detected BianLian in the attacks witnessed.
Execution: Unknown binary launching PowerShell
If leveraging an EDR that classifies binaries as known and unknown, searching for
unknown binaries launching PowerShell will frequently detect use of the BianLian
backdoor
Defense Evasion: Reg.exe modifying safeboot keys
BianLian added a remote access tool to safeboot keys in order to enable network access
for their remote access tool in safeboot.
