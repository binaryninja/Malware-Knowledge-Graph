2017 Magniber ransomware makes a comeback using the same methods: exploiting
unpatched vulnerabilities on South Korean victims
In July 2021, CrowdStrike identified Magniber ransomware attempting to use a known
PrintNightmare vulnerability to compromise victims
CrowdStrike detects and protects against both the exploitation of the PrintNightmare
vulnerability and the Magniber ransomware
CrowdStrike recently observed new activity related to a 2017 ransomware family, known as
Magniber, using the PrintNighmare vulnerability on victims in South Korea. On July 13,
CrowdStrike successfully detected and prevented attempts at exploiting the PrintNightmare
vulnerability, protecting customers before any encryption takes place.
When the PrintNighmare (CVE-2021-34527) vulnerability was disclosed, CrowdStrike
intelligence assessed the vulnerability will likely be used by threat actors as it allowed for
possible remote code execution (RCE) and local privilege escalation (LPE). This assessment
proved accurate in light of the recent incident.

Using mitigations that target the tactics and techniques used by adversaries to compromise
endpoints, the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform provides layered coverage against threats by
using machine learning (on-sensor and in the cloud) and indicators of attack (IOAs) to
identify malicious processes or files associated with known or unknown threats.

A Timeline for the PrintNightmare Vulnerability
June 8, 2021: The PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675) vulnerability was initially discovered
and reported to Microsoft on June 8, by security researchers working for three different
companies. Their research involved attempting to bypass a previous patch addressing the
“PrintDemon” (CVE-2020-1048) vulnerability.
June 21, 2021: While Microsoft released a patch for CVE-2021-1675, as part of Microsoft’s
June 2021 Patch Tuesday, no additional information regarding how to exploit the vulnerability
was made public. At the time, it was believed the vulnerability could only be exploited by a
locally authenticated user. However, the vulnerability was elevated to Critical on June 21 by
Microsoft, as it was determined it could allow for RCE.
June 29, 2021: Independently, one of three additional security researchers investigating a
similar bug in the Windows Print Spooler service inadvertently published a proof of concept
(POC) exploiting the (CVE-2021-1675) vulnerability on a GitHub repository, on June 29.
While the error was shortly corrected, the GitHub repo was reportedly forked and the POC
made it into the wild, potentially leading to abuse by attackers.
July 1, 2021: Although Microsoft addressed the CVE-2021-1675 vulnerability by issuing a
patch, the leaked POC exploited a different attack vector that triggered the Print Spooler
vulnerability. As of July 1, several different proof of concepts exploiting the Printer Spooler
vulnerability were made public. Consequently, a second CVE (CVE-2021-34527) was
created on July 1, with Microsoft stating that “CVE-2021-1675 is similar but distinct from
CVE-2021-34527.”
July 6, 2021: On July 6, Microsoft issued an out-of-band (OOB) update attempting to
mitigate the CVE-2021-34527 vulnerability, but hours later security researchers found that it
was again possible to bypass imposed mitigations under certain conditions. Popular exploit
tools, such as Metasploit and Mimikatz, started incorporating the exploit code, paving the
way for adversary weaponization of a yet unpatched vulnerability.

A Primer on Magniber Ransomware
Magniber ransomware was first spotted in late 2017 targeting victims in South Korea through
malvertising campaigns using the Magnitude Exploit Kit (EK). Previous Magniber campaigns
went through significant efforts to only infect victims in South Korea, although in mid-2018 it
was also spotted targeting victims in other Asia Pacific countries.

2/6

Magnitude Exploit Kit (EK) operators initially used the Cerber ransomware exclusively before
turning to Magniber, which is believed to be the successor of Cerber. The most popular
infection vector for Magniber involved the use of unpatched vulnerabilities, such as Internet
Explorer exploits (CVE-2018-8174, CVE-2021-26411, CVE-2020-0968, CVE-2019-1367) or
Flash (CVE-2018-8174) vulnerabilities, infecting victims through compromised websites or
drive-by downloads.
While the Magniber ransomware only seems to target the Republic of Korea, it has been
active since 2017. Our Falcon OverWatch™ team also spotted more recent activity from
Magniber in early February 2021, exploiting an Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-20200968) to exclusively compromise South Korean victims.
Magniber was under active development to include new obfuscation features, evasion tactics
and encryption mechanisms that made the encryption more robust, showing up in sporadic
campaigns over the years. Its developers also went through a significant effort to limit
infections to Asia Pacific countries by including various language checks.

PrintNightmare Meets Magniber Ransomware
The new incident involving Magniber ransomware using the recent PrintNightmare Printer
Spooler vulnerability is surprising, but not uncommon considering the impact of the
vulnerability. Several POCs have been in circulation since the issue was reported, and it was
only a matter of time until adversaries attempted to leverage it to compromise victims and
deliver malicious payloads.
The Falcon OverWatch team constantly hunts for adversary attempts trying to exploit the
PrintNightmare vulnerability and recently spotted an endeavor to exploit it. A malicious dll
was written to the folder
\Device\HarddiskVolume2\Windows\System32\spool\DRIVERS\x64\3\New\ after which it
was loaded into the spoolsv.exe process. The DLL itself is associated with the Magniber
ransomware and is responsible for deobfuscating the core ransomware DLL and injecting it
into a remote process.
Our IOA coverage that we released as part of the PrintNightmare research successfully
triggers due to this action, and prevents this operation, as seen in the screenshot below.

3/6

CrowdStrike’s behavior-based detection using IOAs successfully prevented the core
ransomware DLL from being injected, thwarting the malicious activity before any encryption
took place on the endpoint.
Analyzing the behavior of the malicious ransomware sample reveals the same Magniber
behavior observed in the past by CrowdStrike security researchers: exploiting a vulnerability,
dropping an obfuscated DLL loader, injecting the loader into a process and then unpacking
the cored DLL loader that performs local file traversal and encryption — which is on par with
the known Magniber modus operandi.
The dropped ransom note does not reveal anything new about the operators behind this
incident or the ransom payment amount. Instead, it provides instructions on contacting the
ransomware operators for potential negotiation and warns victims they have a limited amount
of time to contact them for decryption before the links expire.

CrowdStrike Falcon Protection
CrowdStrike Falcon takes a layered approach to protecting endpoints that are most valuable
to organizations by employing machine learning and behavior-based protection. The critical
Windows Print Spooler vulnerability, PrintNightmare, is something that potentially affects all
Windows hosts, which is why CrowdStrike customers are encouraged to review their
prevention policies in accordance with best practices and get Falcon Spotlight™ vulnerability
management to identify risks related to this. If you are not a customer, you can start a free
trial of Falcon Spotlight today.
CrowdStrike Falcon leverages machine learning and IOAs to identify malicious behavior of
processes or files when dealing with new or unknown threats. This video demonstrates
Falcon’s capabilities to successfully detect and block the Magniber ransomware DLL. First,
learn how Falcon detects Magniber DLL using cloud machine learning written to disk and
when injected into a remote process. Then, see a demo of Falcon’s ability to block the
Magniber ransomware, when all prevention and protection policies are enabled according to
best practices. The Falcon sensor immediately blocks the malicious Magniber behavior,
protecting the endpoint.
CrowdStrike continuously monitors the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
associated with over 160 identified threat actors and numerous unnamed groups and threats,
and incorporates that intelligence into the Falcon platform.

5/6

CrowdStrike estimates that the PrintNightmare vulnerability coupled with the deployment of
ransomware will likely continue to be exploited by other threat actors. We encourage
organizations to always apply the latest patches and security updates to mitigate known
vulnerabilities and adhere to security best practices to strengthen their security posture
against threats and sophisticated adversaries.
