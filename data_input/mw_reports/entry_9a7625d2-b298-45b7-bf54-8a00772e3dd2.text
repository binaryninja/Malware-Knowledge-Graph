An Update: The COVID-19 Vaccine’s Global Cold Chain Continues to Be a Target

Security Services April 14, 2021

1/11

By Melissa Frydrych co-authored by Claire Zaboeva 5 min read
In December 2020, IBM Security X-Force released a research blog disclosing that the
COVID-19 cold chain — an integral part of delivering and storing COVID-19 vaccines at safe
temperatures — was targeted by cyber adversaries. After that first report, we recently
discovered an additional 50 files tied to spear-phishing emails that targeted 44 companies in
14 countries in Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia.
The expanded scope of precision targeting includes key organizations likely underpinning the
transport, warehousing, storage and ultimate distribution of vaccines. Spear-phishing
attempts were associated with multiple executive activities and other roles, including:
Chief Executive Officers

Global Sales Officers

Purchasing Managers

Company Presidents

System Administrators

Sales Representatives

Directors of Finance

Export Sales Managers

Human Resource
Officers

Heads of Marketing &
Communication

Heads of Supply &
Logistics

Heads of Plant
Engineering

The campaign impersonates an executive from Haier Biomedical, a major Chinese
biomedical company that is purported to be the world’s only complete cold chain provider.
The updated findings were made available via our Enterprise Intelligence Management
platform TruSTAR in January 2021. In the same timeframe, X-Force reached out to relevant
CERTS and global entities in concert with our responsible disclosure policy.

Email Significance
Exploring the available emails, X-Force uncovered multiple features which likely signal the
actor’s exceptional knowledge of the cold chain. While our previous reporting featured direct
targeting of supranational organizations, the energy and IT sectors across six nations, we
believe this expansion to be consistent with the established attack pattern, and the campaign
remains a deliberate and calculated threat.
The uncovered emails were sent between Sept. 7-9, several months in advance of the
approval of any COVID-19 vaccine variant, which indicates the attacker was
prepositioning in emerging global infrastructure.
Both the email subject and contents discuss requests for quotes regarding the Cold
Chain Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP) program and contain references to
specific products (a specific solar-powered vaccine refrigerator and ice-lined
refrigerator) from Haier Biomedical’s product line to store and transport vaccines at the
same temperatures of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The related HTML files mention organizations involved in the manufacturing of solar
panels, as well as petrochemical production (dry ice as a primary byproduct), which
directly aligns with the aforementioned products.
The English language in the email aligns with the educational background of the
sender spoofed in the signature block.

Overlapping Infrastructure
Directly following our December publication, X-Force uncovered an additional spear-phishing
email, remarkably similar to the original samples we found. The email was addressed to a
German pharmaceutical and bioscience solutions company involved in vaccine production,
among other specialties, who appears to be a client of one of the original targets we
uncovered. This context to the initial targeted email prompted further investigation.
The connections between the previous and the new files we found feature overlapping
command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and appear to display the same blurred PDF with a
login screen prepopulated with the user’s email address as the ID. Once a user ID and
password are keyed in, the credentials are sent to a C2 server. X-Force assesses that this
activity is aimed at obtaining user credentials for future or secondary attacks.

Most Targeted Industries
The potential targets, categorized into most targeted industries, may present various
avenues into the overall COVID-19 supply chain. They include:
Transportation — X-Force research suggests at least eight unique organizations within the
automotive, aviation, maritime and transport services sectors across Italy, Korea, Japan,
Colombia and the United States may have been targeted.
Health care — Our findings indicate likely targets include organizations associated with
biomedical research, medical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and hygiene services and
headquartered in the Czech Republic, Germany and U.S. The corporations specialize in a
variety of disciplines including immunology, manufacturing of medical accessories,
construction of surgical materials, the creation of pharmaceutical ingredients and online
pharmacies distributing COVID-19 rapid tests.
Information Technology & Electronics — A total of six organizations across Bulgaria,
France, Poland, Ukraine and the U.S. associated with web-hosting services, software
development, IT operations and outsourcing and online platform providers were subject to
activity. Collection against these organizations could provide actors with insight into key
technical requirements concerning the cold chain and vaccine storage.

3/11

In addition to the sectors detailed above, notable clusters of uncovered email addresses
were found to be associated with government organizations, as well as refrigeration and
metal manufacturing technology. X-Force uncovered likely instances of activity directed
against government ministries and departments in Europe, specifically supporting
import/export of special goods, transport and public health and safety. All addressees are
specific individuals of these organizations, including the precision targeting of (at the time of
the campaign) a major central European country’s department head of prevention.
As reported in the X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, industries that governments
worldwide have heavily relied on for COVID-19 response efforts were at the epicenter of
targeting during 2020, with attacks on manufacturing, energy and health care doubling from
the previous year. This serves as yet another reminder that organizations and industries on
the forefront of critical infrastructure and critical supply chains, such as the COVID-19 cold
chain, are targets of high interest to adversaries.

What Are Attackers Likely Looking For?
With more than 350 logistics partners around the world, UNICEF and the COVID-19 vaccine
cold chain will rely on seamless, multimodal transport systems to ensure that vaccines are
transported in a timely and safe manner around the world. Attackers could be looking to
infiltrate this extended supply chain to gain privileged insight into some of the following
aspects:
Privileged insight into national Advance Market Commitment (AMC) negotiations
surrounding the national procurement of vaccines.
Key timetables for distribution, information regarding expedited passage of COVID-19
vaccines through various nations and territories.
Export controls and international property rights, government measures taken to
facilitate the time-sensitive cargo including pre-arrival processing.
Collection or duplication of electronic submission of documents for pre-arrival
processing.
Transit and World Trade Organization (WTO) trade facilitation agreements, clearance
for transport crews and security of the cargo, border crossing regulations and physical
inspections.
Key technical requirements surrounding warehousing and energy/electrical component
requirements for maintaining temperature-controlled environments during vaccine
storage.
While clear attribution remains presently unavailable, the rise of ‘vaccine nationalism’ and
increased global competition surrounding access to vaccines suggests the higher likelihood
of a nation-state operation.

A Reminder to Stay Vigilant
4/11

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented race between rival nations on an
unequal economic plane. It is almost inevitable to see this type of adversarial activity in a
threat landscape that is already extremely active on the nation-state attack front.
Any disruption to the requisite conditions, including freight, storage and logistics, could result
in impotent or unsafe vaccines, leading to devastating effects on global health security. A
better understanding of espionage efforts that could result in actions against the supply chain
raises the importance of staying vigilant and aware of the related risks and ramifications. For
recommendations on how to increase their cyber readiness, defenders can read our original
research blog.
