Finally I can summarize all the events and statistics collected in 2018, quite
a complicated year from an infosec perspective. For those of you that keep
asking, every two weeks (more or less) I publish a timeline with the main
cyber attacks occurred in that period. Every timeline contains the link with
the details of the events, and

nally, every month (more or less), the

timelines are aggregated to provide a statistical overview of the period.
Moreover, the taxonomy of the categories is inherited from the
International Standard Industrial Classi cation
So during 2018, I have collected a total of 1337 events that you can nd in
the following table (and after the table you will nd the statistics):

The following charts compare the distribution of motivations between

an increase of nearly 5 points in comparison to 2017. All the other
motivations (cyber espionage, hacktivism and cyber warfare) has
experienced a decrease in 2018.

And I think that for 2018 is pretty much everything. Feel free to share the
links and use the data (for personal purposes) as needed. Also remember
that this is only the tip of the iceberg, and obviously my stats can’t be
comprehensive. My humble mission is just to rise the awareness and keep
the level of attention on the cyber threats constantly high.
