Large botnet cause of recent Tor network overload

September 5, 2013

Recently, Roger Dingledine described a sudden increase in Tor users on the Tor Talk
mailinglist. To date there has been a large amount of speculation as to why this may have
happened. A large number of articles seem to suggest this to be the result of the recent
global espionage events, the evasion of the Pirate Bay blockades using the PirateBrowser or
the Syrian civil war.
At the time of writing, the amount of Tor clients actually appears to have more than
quintupled already. The graph shows no signs of a decline in growth, as seen below:

An alternative recurring explanation is the increased usage of botnets using Tor, based on
the assertion that the increase appears to consist of mostly new users to Tor that apparently
are not doing much given the limited impact on Tor exit performance. In recent days, we
have indeed found evidence which suggests that a specific and rather unknown botnet is
responsible for the majority of the sudden uptick in Tor users. A recent detection name that
has been used in relation to this botnet is “Mevade.A”, but older references suggest the
name “Sefnit”, which dates back to at least 2009 and also included Tor connectivity. We have
found various references that the malware is internally known as SBC to its operators.

Previously, the botnet communicated mainly using HTTP as well as alternative
communication methods. More recently and coinciding with the uptick in Tor users, the
botnet switched to Tor as its method of communication for its command and control channel.
The botnet appears to be massive in size as well as very widespread. Even prior to the
switch to Tor, it consisted of tens of thousands of confirmed infections within a limited amount
of networks. When these numbers are extrapolated on a per country and global scale, these
are definitely in the same ballpark as the Tor user increase.
Thus one important thing to note is that this was an already existing botnet of massive scale,
even prior to the conversion to using Tor and .onion as command and control channel.
As pointed out in the Tor weekly news, the version of Tor that is used by the new Tor clients
must be 0.2.3.x, due to the fact that they do not use the new Tor handshake method. Based
on the code we can confirm that the version of Tor that is used is 0.2.3.25.

The malware uses command and control connectivity via Tor .onion links using HTTP. While
some bots continue to operate using the standard HTTP connectivity, some versions of the
malware use a peer-to-peer network to communicate (KAD based).
Typically, it is fairly clear what the purpose of malware is, such as banking, clickfraud,
ransomware or fake anti-virus malware. In this case however it is a bit more difficult. It is
possible that the purpose of this malware network is to load additional malware onto the
system and that the infected systems are for sale. We have however no compelling evidence
that this is true, so this assumption is merely based on a combination of small hints. It does
however originate from a Russian spoken region, and is likely motivated by direct or indirect
financial related crime.
This specific version of the malware, which includes the Tor functionality, will install itself in:
%SYSTEM%\config\systemprofile\Local Settings\Application Data\Windows Internet Name
System\wins.exe

Additionally, it will install a Tor component in:
%PROGRAMFILES%\Tor\Tor.exe
