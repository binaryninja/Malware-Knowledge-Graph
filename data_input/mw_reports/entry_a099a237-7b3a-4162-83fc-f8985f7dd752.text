Vaccinating against Spora ransomware: a proof-of-concept tool by Minerva

Synopsis
Spora is presently among the most common ransomware families. For instance, it struck
countless victims in the fake "Chrome Font Pack Update" campaign, encrypting victims’ files
even without having to communicate over the Internet. Minerva is releasing a proof-ofconcept tool that is able to contain Spora infections by generating an infection marker that
this ransomware seeks, to determine whether it’s already running on the system.
This is a proof of concept demonstrating how to vaccinate against Spora. For more

The code
The actual vaccination code can be found in the VaccinateSpora() method in
Program.cs :

private bool VaccinateSpora()
{
uint volumeSerialNumber, maxComponentLength;
WinApi.FileSystemFeature fileSystemFlags;
if (!WinApi.GetVolumeInformation(@"C:\", null, 0, out volumeSerialNumber, out
maxComponentLength, out fileSystemFlags, null, 0))
{
return false;
}
string mutexName = "m" + volumeSerialNumber;
if (WinApi.CreateMutex(IntPtr.Zero, false, mutexName) == IntPtr.Zero)
{
return false;
}
return true;
}
