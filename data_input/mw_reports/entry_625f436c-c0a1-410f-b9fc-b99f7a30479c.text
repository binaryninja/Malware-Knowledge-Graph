Hive Ransomware Technical Analysis and Initial Access Discovery

Stephen Green

1/18

Elio Biasiotto
Hive has been seized by law enforcement, but we're likely to still see these initial access
methods and tactics used across other threat actor groups.
Kroll has observed an increase in Hive ransomware incidents across a wide range of
industry verticals. A new trend of initial infection vector (IIV) has been identified by Kroll
analysts that may relate to the increase of activity and the varying nature of targets. Across a
number of incidents, the IIV was attributed to IT administrators looking to download common
softwares from Google such as TeamViewer, Zoom and AnyDesk, and they were provided
with advertisements for these tools at the top of their search results. We recently reported on
this trend, where threat actors were abusing Google Ads to deploy malware via downloads.
When these IT administrators downloaded the desired “tools” from the malicious ad links,
Batloader was also unknowingly delivered. Batloader is an initial access malware utilized to
deliver tools such as Zloader, Ursnif and Vidar to further establish the threat actor’s foothold
within a network. Cobalt Strike can then be installed to maintain command and control. Once
the threat actor has acquired credentials and identified sensitive files for exfiltration, they are
able to utilize common exfiltration tools such as WinSCP and Rclone to extract a victim’s

data. The ransomware binary is then executed with a specific identifiable encryption key and
this is used to create the ransom note named “HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt” and appends a
specific file extension related to a dropped key file within the root of C:\.
A login is provided for the victim to access the Hive “Sales Department” onion site, and if
demands are not met, data is then shared on their “Hive Leak” onion site.

Timeline of Incident

Initial Exploit
In a recent case, after the IT administrator searched for TeamViewer and clicked the
advertisement link, they were directed to https://caroseyama[.]xyz/9hjLXZR?
https://www.teamviewer[.]com/en/customer-support. This link then redirected to
https://teamviewclouds[.]com/index.php. Our experts analyzed the teamviewclouds domain
and identified a large number of similar typosquatted domains for a wide range of common
software hosted on the same IP address and hosted by regprivate[.]ru. Most of these
domains were inactive, which suggests that the threat actors are continually creating new
advertisements. An installation file is then provided from
https://dc444.4sync[.]com/download/fXx-c_iZ/InstallerV36__218_.zip, which is the Batloader
.msi file. The file sharing provider 4sync has been identified across separate Batloader
incidents and appears to serve the Batloader .msi download.

The installer itself installed novaPDF by Softland rather than TeamViewer and dropped
PowerShell scripts “scrED95.ps1” and “pssEDC6.ps1”. “pssEDC6.ps1” is a conversion script
that creates the initial downloader script “scrED95.ps1”. This script downloads the initial
Batloader script “update.bat” and sets the working directory to the user’s appdata local
directory. The scripts are executed by PowerShell as shown in figure 2.

Toolkit Deployment and Escalation
To maintain persistence and to gain increased privileges, Hive actors leverage Batloader to
download Ursnif and Vidar, but also attempt to gain the highest privileges possible to install
the malware. The initial Batloader script downloads “requestadmin.bat” and attempts to
execute it with evaluated privileges by nircmd.exe.
powershell Invoke-WebRequest

cmd /c nircmd elevatecmd exec hide "requestadmin.bat"
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 20

Figure 4: update.bat

4/18

The “requestadmin.bat” then attempts to download further scripts named “runanddelete.bat”
and “scripttodo.ps1”. The script itself also attempts to whitelist specific paths from Windows
Defender before downloading Nsudo.exe. Nsudo provides capabilities to execute binaries
with elevated privileges, which are then used to edit the system registry to disable the user
access control prompt and to disable task manager and other registry tools. The Windows
power system settings tool Powercfg is then executed to disable sleep, which will allow the
threat actor to maintain persistent access.

Figure 5: requestadmin.bat
The script “runanddelete.bat” appears to be a modified open-source script named “getadmin.bat”. This script attempts to spawn the user access control prompt to gain the
increased privileges to then spawn an Administrator shell, via a created file named

6/18

“getadmin.vbs”. Once increased privileges are achieved, it then attempts to run Ursnif
(d2ef5.exe). Ursnif can be used to extract system information and seek to steal user
credentials.

Figure 6: runanddelete.bat
The script “scripttodo.ps1” initially installs GNU Privacy Guard for Windows (“Gpg4Win”),
which is a file encryption software. Vidar binaries are then downloaded and decrypted by
Gpg4Win along with a further attempt to download Nsudo.exe. The Vidar binaries are then
executed, likely in an attempt to further gather system information and to gather credentials.
The script also creates exclusions in the registry to prevent Windows Defender alerting on
execution.

If required, the threat actors have also used minidump and ProcDump to dump the LSASS
process. This is likely an attempt to dump NTLM credential hashes for password cracking, or
for pass the hash techniques. PowerSploit has also been identified with attempts to run
“Invoke-Kerberoast” to gain Kerberos ticket hashes for service accounts. This would likely
provide the threat actor with increased privileges or access if successful.

Common remote access software such as Splashtop can be installed via Cobalt Strike to
provide a persistent, seemingly legitimate access to the network. This also allows the threat
actor to conduct hands-on operations. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used with
legitimate accounts to navigate across the network.

Internal Scouting
Once the threat actor gains a foothold within the network, Kroll has observed the use of tools
such as ADFind to identify accounts and servers. Other common tools such as nslookup and
whoami have also been used to gain initial system information.
The Exchange PowerShell module Get-DomainController has also been identified when
leveraging Cobalt Strike to execute commands. This module provides information on the
domain controller for the local domain.

The threat actors look to identify sensitive files for exfiltration before encrypting devices by
using tools such as Rclone to automate data extraction to cloud storage. Kroll has observed
that threat actors have searched for files using PowerShell and manual traversal across files.
MITRE ATT&CK: T1005: Data from Local System
MITRE ATT&CK: T1567.002: Exfiltration Over Web Service : Exfiltration to Cloud Storage
MITRE ATT&CK: T1020: Automate Exfiltration
To push the ransomware binary across the network, the sysinternals tool PsExec has been
leveraged as well as custom scripts to deploy the encryptor. The ransomware binary itself
appears to come in both 64 and 32 bit versions. To encrypt, the binary requires the login and
password ".\windows_x64_encrypt.exe -u login:password”. There are other options available
for file encryption including:
-local-only: Encrypt only local files.
-no-discovery: Do not look for network shares.
-explicit-only: Encrypt specific directories.
By default, the binary prevents recovery by deleting volume shadow copies “vssadmin.exe
delete shadows /all /quiet” and deletes system backups with “wbadmin.exe delete
systemstatebackup” and “wbadmin.exe delete catalog-quiet” before preventing recovery from
boot with “\bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No” and “bcdedit.exe" /set {default}
bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures”. The binary encrypts files, except for “.lnk” files and
binaries within “C:\windows”, before generating two key files in the root of C:\. The key files
also determine the extension string added to the encrypted files along with a base64
encoded pointer.

Your network has been breached and all data were encrypted.
Personal data, financial reports and important documents are ready to disclose.
To decrypt all the data and to prevent exfiltrated files to be disclosed at
http://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc3xw7ez7iqy6wc34gd2nekazyd[.]onion/
you will need to purchase our decryption software.
Please contact our sales department at:

Follow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:
- Do not modify, rename or delete *.key files. Your data will be
undecryptable.
- Do not modify or rename encrypted files. You will lose them.
- Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business.
They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result you will lose everything.
- Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.
They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are
good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.
- Do not reject to purchase. Exfiltrated files will be publicly disclosed.

Recommendations
Kroll has identified recommendations relating to this alert:
Recommendation

Observation

Monitor PowerShell execution

The threat actor utilized Cobalt Strike. Monitoring
PowerShell execution can identify malicious activity
associated with Cobalt Strike.

Ensure PowerShell is logged,
and create detections for
encoded script execution.

15/18

Enable credential guard
Windows Credential Guard can
provide protection against
password extraction and other
authentication attacks.
Audit user, administrator and
service accounts
Ensure accounts have the
correct access and privileges.
Implement the principle of least
privilege.
Implement multi-factor
authentication
Multi-factor authentication can
restrict access to sensitive areas
and can prevent lateral
movement.
Review backup strategies
Ensure multiple backups are
taken and at least one backup is
isolated from the network.
Review remote access tools

The threat actor dumped LSASS and conducted
Kerberos attacks. Credential guard can offer some
protection against these attacks.

The threat actor is often able to install tools on user
endpoints. Limiting the privileges of users can prevent
a threat actor from installing malicious software.

Enabling multi-factor authentication can prevent a
threat actor from moving laterally and accessing
sensitive data.

As a ransomware actor’s main aim is to disrupt
business, ensuring a viable backup and recovery
strategy is in place can allow a business to recover
quickly.

Threat actors leverage legitimate remote access tools
to maintain persistence. Ensure remote access is
monitored and that only approved remote access tools
exist in the environment.
