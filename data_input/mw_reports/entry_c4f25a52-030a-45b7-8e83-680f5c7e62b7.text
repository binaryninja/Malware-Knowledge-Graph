CrowdStrike Protects Against NotPetya Attack
June 28, 2017
Falcon Intelligence Team From The Front Lines Research & Threat Intel

Update:
Due to naming convention consistency in the industry, CrowdStrike is now calling this
variant of Petya – NotPetya.
On June 27 at approximately 10:30 UTC, a new ransomware family began propagating
across multiple countries. The family, referred to as NotPetya, is noteworthy because it
combines traditional ransomware behavior with stealthy propagation techniques and a
destructive attack element. CrowdStrike Falcon® Endpoint Protection customers are
protected against all currently identified variants of the threat. For more details, read:

Credential Theft.

In addition to encrypting files on infected systems, NotPetya moves laterally to encrypt other
systems in the organization by leveraging the same EternalBlue vulnerability that was
popularized by WannaCry last month. It then uses another propagation technique that starts
by stealing credentials, then uses those legitimate credentials to infect other systems on the
network via built-in Microsoft tools (WMI and PSEXEC). Finally, NotPetya employs a
destructive technique that prevents infected systems from booting by encrypting the master
boot record (MBR).
Attacks have been reported in countries including Ukraine, Russia, Poland, France,
Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, Israel, Australia and the
United States. Sectors impacted by this attack include government, energy, finance,
defense, telecom, media, maritime, aviation, and transportation.
NotPetya Summary
Initial infection in Ukraine accomplished by exploiting vulnerability in M.E.Doc software
Infected systems then attempt to propagate the infection to other systems
To infect other systems inside the organization, the malware steals credentials
and propagates with built-in Windows tools WMI and PSEXEC:
PSEXEC code snippet: C:\Windows\dllhost.dat \\IP ADDRESS -accepteula -s -d
C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe “C:\Windows\perfc.dat”,#1 10
“USERNAME:PASSWORD”
WMI code snippet: C:\Windows\system32\wbem\wmic.exe /node:”IP ADDRESS”
/user:”USERNAME” /password:”PASSWORD” process call create
“C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe \”C:\Windows\perfc.dat\” #1 XX
\”USERNAME:PASSWORD\”
To infect additional systems outside the organization, the malware attempts to
exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability
The malicious payload then begins encrypting data, which includes the Master File
Table and MBR
The attack creates a scheduled task to reboot the system after a certain amount
of time has passed (up to 60 minutes):
Code snippet: schtasks /RU “SYSTEM” /Create /SC once /TN “” /TR
“C:\Windows\system32\shutdown.exe /r /f” /ST XX:XX (where XX:XX is the time)
It also attempts to cover its tracks by running commands to delete event logs and the
disk change journal:
Code snippet 1: wevtutil cl Setup & wevtutil cl System & wevtutil cl Security &
wevtutil cl Application
Code snippet 2: fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:

Upon reboot the end user cannot get back into Windows, and instead they see a
ransom note (screenshot below). This happens because NotPetya encrypted the
MBR, thereby breaking the normal Windows boot process.

Initial Vector
According to multiple sources, infections of NotPetya were first identified on systems
running a legitimate updater for the document management software M.E.Doc. This
software is heavily used by Ukrainian companies, and companies operating in Ukraine, for
maintaining information on tax and payroll accounting. From these infected systems, the
ransomware can propagate to other systems using the techniques described above.
Based on analysis of the M.E.Doc software, and forensic analysis of initially infected hosts,
it is believed that the malware was first deployed as a software update. Further third-party
reporting suggests that the M.E.Doc update process started distributing a new binary
containing a malicious payload at approximately 10:30 UTC. The deployment of NotPetya
has also been reported by M.E.Doc users on the software company’s forum in
environments in which only this software was present.
Payment Mechanism
The ransomware operators demanded a ransom of $300 USD for each infected machine,
and established Bitcoin payment workflow through an email address
(wowsmith123456@posteo[.]net) provided by the third-party email service Posteo. Upon
notification of this incident by the security community, the email provider announced that
service to this address had been suspended as of 16:15 UTC (https://posteo.de/blog/infozur-ransomware-petrwrappetya-betroffenes-postfach-bereits-seit-mittag-gesperrt). As a

result, recovery of files upon payment of the ransom is no longer possible for impacted
victims, as no mechanism currently exists for the ransomware operators to provide victims
with decryption keys.
Once the malware is deployed on a victim machine, it creates a scheduled task to reboot
the host an hour after the infection, likely in order to allow it to spread further before
launching its destructive payload. To achieve this, the malware drops and runs either an x86
or an x64 version of a credential stealer executable from a resource that contains code
similar to the well-known Mimikatz tool.
The ransomware payload uses a combination of 2048-bit RSA and 128-bit AES in Cipher
Block Chaining (CBC) mode to encrypt files with extensions matching entries from a hardcoded list. Public reporting mentions similarities with the Petya ransomware; however,
CrowdStrike was not able to confirm any links, and assesses that the code structure of this
new family is different from Petya’s.
Protection Against NotPetya
CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection can prevent both the initial NotPetya infection and
subsequent propagation attempts. In the first example, Falcon is shown blocking the
NotPetya malware from executing.

The second example shows a system on the same network as a system that is already
infected. Because that second system is protected by Falcon, the propagation attempt fails
and the second system is protected.

Falcon can also detect the threat based on its behavior. In the example below,
RUNDLL32.EXE is exhibiting malicious behavior. It is attempting to execute a malicious
DLL while simultaneously trying to steal credentials and write them to a temp file, as well as
invoking a command to set the task scheduler to reboot the system in the near future.

The critical part of the attack is the RUNDLL32.EXE step (in orange). Because Falcon
recognizes this collection of related behaviors as malicious, it prevents the execution of the
process (as depicted below).

Falcon Endpoint Protection protects against NotPetya with both machine learning and
behavioral protection. Falcon Prevent and Falcon Endpoint Protection customers can
enable this protection by enabling “Moderate Prevention” settings on the machine learning
engine sliders, including File Attribute, File Analysis, and On-Sensor Machine Learning
under Process Blocking, please ensure Prevent Suspicious Processes is enabled.
