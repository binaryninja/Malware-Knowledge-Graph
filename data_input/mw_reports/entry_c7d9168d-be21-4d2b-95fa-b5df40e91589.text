With Russian troops targeting Ukraine and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
sporadically disrupting Ukrainian government websites and financial service providers, there
is much talk about being prepared for cyber conflict.
While all organizations should always be prepared for an attack from any direction, it can be
helpful to know what to look for when the risk of attack increases. I decided to review the
history of known or suspected Russian state activities in the cyber realm to assess what
types of activities to expect and how organizations can be prepared.

Destabilizing denial of service attacks
The earliest known activity dates to April 26, 2007, when the Estonian government moved a
statue commemorating the Soviet Union’s liberation of Estonia from the Nazis to a less
prominent location. This action infuriated Estonia’s Russian speaking population and
destabilized relations with Moscow. Soon after there were riots in the streets, protests
outside of the Estonian embassy in Moscow and a wave of debilitating DDoS attacks on
Estonian government and financial services websites.

Fully prepared tools and instructions on how to participate in DDoS attacks appeared on
Russian forums almost immediately after the moving of the statue. These attacks targeted
websites belonging to the President, Parliament, police, political parties, and major media
outlets.
While calling on fellow “Russian patriots” to help punish Estonia, this was unlikely to have
been a grassroots movement that sprung from zero with tools and a list of targets at the
ready. The same tactics were later deployed by Anonymous in defense of Wikileaks, using a
tool called the low orbit ion canon (LOIC).
On May 4, 2007, the attacks intensified and additionally began targeting banks. Exactly
seven days later the attacks ceased at midnight, as abruptly as they had begun.
Everyone immediately implicated Russia, but attributing distributed denial of service attacks
is near impossible, by design. It is now widely believed these DDoS attacks were the work of
the Russian Business Network (RBN), a notorious organized crime group in Russia with ties
to spamming, botnets and pharmaceutical affiliate schemes. Their services appear to have
been “procured” for precisely a week to conduct these attacks.
On July 19, 2008, a new wave of DDoS attacks began targeting news and government
websites in Georgia. These attacks mysteriously intensified dramatically on August 8, 2008,
as Russian troops invaded the separatist province of South Ossetia. Initially they targeted
Georgian news and government sites before moving on to include financial institutions,
businesses, education, Western media, and a Georgian hacker website.
Like the earlier attacks on Estonia, a website appeared featuring a list of targets as well as a
set of tools with instructions for using them. This ruse also attempted to attribute the attacks
to “patriots” defending against Georgian aggression, yet most of the actual attack traffic
originated from a known large botnet believed to be controlled by RBN.

Digital defacement and spam
The attacks on Georgia also included website defacements and massive spam campaigns
designed to clog Georgian’s inboxes. All of this appeared to be designed to inspire a lack of
confidence in the ability of Georgia to defend and govern itself and to prevent the
government from effectively communicating with its citizens and the outside world.
Less than a year later, a further series of DDoS attacks began in Kyrgyzstan in January
2009. This happened to coincide with a decision-making process the Kyrgyzstani
government was entering into to decide whether to renew a lease on a US air base in their
territory. Coincidence? It appeared to be conducted by the RBN once again, but this time no
ruse of “patriots” expressing their digital opinions.
This brings us to the most recent kinetic conflict, the invasion of Crimea in 2014.

Disinformation and isolation
Low-level information warfare has been ongoing against Ukraine since 2009, with many
attacks coinciding with events that could be interpreted as threatening to Russian interests
such as a NATO summit and negotiations between Ukraine and the EU for an Association
Agreement.
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that “Snake” malware had infiltrated the
Ukraine Prime Minister’s Office and several remote embassies at the same time as antigovernment protests began in Ukraine. Near the end of 2013 and into 2014, ESET also
published research documenting attacks against military targets and media outlets dubbed
“Operation Potao Express.”
As before a homegrown cyber group known as “Cyber Berkut” executed DDoS attacks and
web defacements, without causing much actual harm. It did, however, create a lot of
confusion and that alone has an impact during times of conflict.
Early in the conflict soldiers without insignias seized control of Crimea’s telecommunications
networks and the only internet exchange in the region, causing an information blackout. The
attackers abused their access to the mobile phone network to identify anti-Russian
protesters and send them SMS messages saying, “Dear subscriber, you are registered as a
participant in a mass disturbance.”
After isolating Crimea’s ability to communicate, the attackers also tampered with the mobile
phones of members of the Ukrainian Parliament, preventing them from effectively reacting to
the invasion. As noted in Military Cyber Affairs, disinformation campaigns kicked into full
swing:
“In one case, Russia paid a single person to hold multiple different web identities. One actor
in St. Petersburg conveyed that she was acting as three different bloggers with ten blogs,
while also commenting on other sites. Another individual was employed to simply comment
on news and social media 126 times every twelve hours.”

Paralyzing power supplies
On December 23, 2015, the power was abruptly turned off for about half of the residents of
Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. This is widely believed to have been the work of state-sponsored
Russian hackers. The initial attacks began more than 6 months before the power blinked out
when employees at three power distribution centers opened a malicious Microsoft Office
document with a macro designed to install malware called BlackEnergy.
The attackers were able to acquire remote access credentials to the Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) network and take control of the substation controls to begin
opening circuit breakers. The attackers then proceeded to brick those remote controls to
prevent the breakers from being closed remotely to restore power. Additionally, the attackers
3/7

deployed a “wiper” to brick the computers used to control the grid and simultaneously
conducted a telephone denial of service (TDoS) attack by clogging the customer service
numbers, frustrating customers trying to report the outages.
Nearly one year later, on December 17, 2016, the lights blinked out once again in Kyiv.
Coincidence? Likely not.
This time the malware responsible was called Industroyer/CrashOverride and it was
immensely more sophisticated. The malware was designed with modular components that
could scan the network to find SCADA controllers and it also spoke their language. It also
had a wiper component to erase the system. The attack didn’t appear related to BlackEnergy
or the known wiper tool, KillDisk, but there was no doubt who was behind it.

Email exposure
In June 2016, during a close Presidential election campaign between Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump, a new character named Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the scene claiming to have
hacked the Democratic National Committee and proceeded to hand over their emails to
Wikileaks. While not officially attributed to Russia, this appeared alongside other
disinformation campaigns during the 2016 election and is widely believed to be the work of
the Kremlin.

Supply chain attacks: NotPetya
Russia’s persistent attacks against Ukraine weren’t over and they turned up the heat on June
27, 2017, when they unleashed a new piece of malware now dubbed NotPetya.
NotPetya was disguised as a new strain of ransomware and deployed through a hacked
supply chain of a Ukrainian accounting software provider. In fact, it was not really
ransomware at all. Although it would encrypt a computer, it was impossible to decrypt,
effectively wiping the device and making it useless.
The victims weren’t limited to Ukrainian companies. The malware spread around the world
within hours, mostly impacting organizations that had operations in Ukraine where the
booby-trapped accounting software was used.
NotPetya is estimated to have caused at least $10 billion USD in damage worldwide.

False Flags
As the Winter Olympic games opened in PyeongChang on February 9, 2018, another attack
was about to be unleashed on the world. The malware attack disabled every domain
controller across the entire Olympic network, preventing everything from Wi-Fi to ticket gates

4/7

from working properly. Miraculously, the IT team was able to isolate the network, rebuild and
remove the malware from the systems and have everything up and running for the next
morning, barely skipping a beat.
Then it was time to conduct the malware analysis to attempt to determine who would want to
attack and disable the entire Olympic network? Malware attribution is hard, but there were
some clues left behind that might help, or they could be false flags trying to point the finger at
an uninvolved third party.
The “evidence” appeared to point at North Korea and China, yet it was almost too obvious to
attempt to blame North Korea. In the end, some brilliant detective work by Igor Soumenkov
of Kaspersky Lab found a smoking gun that pointed directly at Moscow.
A few years later, just before the festive holidays in late 2020, word spread of a supply chain
attack targeting the SolarWinds Orion software used to manage networking infrastructure for
large and mid-size organizations around the globe, including many US Federal Government
agencies. The software update mechanisms had been hijacked and used to deploy a
backdoor.
The high-profile nature of the victims, combined with the access afforded through the
stealthily deployed backdoor may make this attack one of the largest and most damaging
cyberespionage attacks in modern history.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), the Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the National
Security Agency (NSA) released a joint statement saying their investigation indicated that:
“…an Advanced Persistent Threat actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all
of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and nongovernmental networks. At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an
intelligence gathering effort.”

Russian cyberconflict in 2022
In 2022, as political tensions escalated in advance of the war, numerous Ukrainian
government websites were defaced, and systems were infected with malware disguised as a
ransomware attack.
Multiple components of these attacks echoed the past. The malware was not actually
ransomware, it was simply a sophisticated wiper, as was seen in the NotPetya attacks.
Additionally, there were many false flags left behind implying it might be the work of
Ukrainian dissidents or Polish partisans.
As the conflict moved into February, it became clear that the standard Russian conflict
playbook was in action: distract, confuse, deny, and attempt to divide.
5/7

On Tuesday February 15, 2022, a series of debilitating DDoS attacks were unleashed
against Ukrainian government and military websites, as well as against three of Ukraine’s
largest banks. In an unprecedented move the White House has already declassified some
intelligence and pinned the attacks on the Russian GRU.
The war began on February 24, 2022. Sophos is maintaining a rolling summary of
cyberattack developments as they unfold.

The Russian playbook for cyberwarfare
What now? Regardless of whether things continue to escalate, cyberoperations are sure to
continue. Ukraine has been under a constant barrage of attacks with varying degrees of
peaks and troughs since Viktor Yanukovych was deposed in 2014.
Russia’s official “The Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation” from 2010 states:
“the prior implementation of measures of information warfare in order to achieve political
objectives without the utilization of military force and, subsequently, in the interest of shaping
a favourable response from the world community to the utilization of military force.”
This suggests a continuance of previous behaviors before a conflict, and makes DDoS
attacks a potential sign of an imminent kinetic response.
Information warfare is how the Kremlin can try to control the rest of the world’s response to
actions in Ukraine or any other target of attack.
False flags, misattribution, disrupted communications, and social media manipulation are all
key components of Russia’s information warfare playbook. They don’t need to create a
permanent cover for activities on the ground and elsewhere, they simply need to cause
enough delay, confusion and contradiction to enable other simultaneous operations to
accomplish their objectives.

Prepare and protect
Interestingly, the United States and United Kingdom are trying to preempt some of the
misinformation campaigns, and this could limit their effectiveness. However, we shouldn’t
assume the attackers will stop trying, so we need to remain prepared and vigilant.
For example, organizations in countries surrounding Ukraine should be prepared to be drawn
into any online mischief, even if they are not operating directly inside Ukraine. Previous
attacks and misinformation have leaked over into Estonia, Poland, and other bordering
states, even if only as collateral damage.
From a global perspective, we should expect a range of “patriotic” freelancers in Russia, by
which I mean ransomware criminals, phish writers and botnet operators, to lash out with
even more fervor than normal at targets perceived to be against the Motherland.
6/7

It is unlikely Russia would directly attack NATO members and risk invocation of Article V.
However, its recent gestures toward reining in criminals operating from the Russian
Federation and their Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) partners will probably
come to an end, and instead we will see the threats multiply.
While defense-in-depth security should be the normal thing to strive for at the best of times, it
is especially important if we can expect an increase in the frequency and severity of attacks.
The misinformation and propaganda will soon reach a fever pitch, but we must keep our
nose to the ground, batten down the hatches and monitor for anything unusual on our
networks as the conflict cycles ebb and flow and even when/if they end soon. Because as we
all know, it could take months for evidence of digital intrusions due to this Russian-Ukrainian
conflict to surface.
