Google’s Threat Analysis Group tracks actors involved in disinformation campaigns,
government backed hacking, and financially motivated abuse. We have a long-standing
policy to send you a warning if we detect that your account is a target of government-backed
phishing or malware attempts. So far in 2021, we’ve sent over 50,000 warnings, a nearly
33% increase from this time in 2020. This spike is largely due to blocking an unusually large
campaign from a Russian actor known as APT28 or Fancy Bear.
We intentionally send these warnings in batches to all users who may be at risk, rather than
at the moment we detect the threat itself, so that attackers cannot track our defense
strategies. On any given day, TAG is tracking more than 270 targeted or government-backed
attacker groups from more than 50 countries. This means that there is typically more than
one threat actor behind the warnings.
In this blog, we explore some of the most notable campaigns we’ve disrupted this year from
a different government-backed attacker: APT35, an Iranian group, which regularly conducts
phishing campaigns targeting high risk users. This is the one of the groups we disrupted
during the 2020 US election cycle for its targeting of campaign staffers. For years, this group
has hijacked accounts, deployed malware, and used novel techniques to conduct espionage
aligned with the interests of the Iranian government.

Hijacked websites used for credential phishing attacks
1/7

In early 2021, APT35 compromised a website affiliated with a UK university to host a
phishing kit. Attackers sent email messages with links to this website to harvest credentials
for platforms such as Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo. Users were instructed to activate an
invitation to a (fake) webinar by logging in. The phishing kit will also ask for second-factor
authentication codes sent to devices.
APT35 has relied on this technique since 2017 — targeting high-value accounts in
government, academia, journalism, NGOs, foreign policy, and national security. Credential
phishing through a compromised website demonstrates these attackers will go to great
lengths to appear legitimate – as they know it's difficult for users to detect this kind of attack.

Utilization of Spyware Apps
2/7

In May 2020, we discovered that APT35 attempted to upload spyware to the Google Play
Store. The app was disguised as VPN software that, if installed, could steal sensitive
information such as call logs, text messages, contacts, and location data from devices.
Google detected the app quickly and removed it from the Play Store before any users had a
chance to install it. Although Play Store users were protected, we are highlighting the app
here as TAG has seen APT35 attempt to distribute this spyware on other platforms as
recently as July 2021.

Conference-themed phishing emails
One of the most notable characteristics of APT35 is their impersonation of conference
officials to conduct phishing attacks. Attackers used the Munich Security and the Think-20
(T20) Italy conferences as lures in non-malicious first contact email messages to get users to
respond. When they did, attackers sent them phishing links in follow-on correspondence.
Targets typically had to navigate through at least one redirect before landing on a phishing
domain. Link shorteners and click trackers are heavily used for this purpose, and are
oftentimes embedded within PDF files. We’ve disrupted attacks using Google Drive, App

Scripts, and Sites pages in these campaigns as APT35 tries to get around our defenses.
Services from Dropbox and Microsoft are also abused.

Telegram for threat actor notifications
One of APT35’s novel techniques involves using Telegram for operator notifications. The
attackers embed javascript into phishing pages that notify them when the page has been
loaded. To send the notification, they use the Telegram API sendMessage function, which
lets anyone use a Telegram bot to send a message to a public channel. The attackers use
this function to relay device-based data to the channel, so they can see details such as the
IP, useragent, and locales of visitors to their phishing sites in real-time. We reported the bot
to Telegram and they have taken action to remove it.

How we keep users safe from these threats
We warn users when we suspect a government-backed threat like APT35 is targeting them.
Thousands of these warnings are sent every month, even in cases where the corresponding
attack is blocked. If you receive a warning it does not mean your account has been
compromised, it means you have been identified as a target.
Workspace administrators are also notified regarding targeted accounts in their domain.
Users are encouraged to take these warnings seriously and consider enrolling in the
Advanced Protection Program or enabling two-factor authentication if they haven't already.
We also block malicious domains using Google Safe Browsing – a service that Google's
security team built to identify unsafe websites across the web and notify users and website
owners of potential harm. When a user of a Safe Browsing-enabled browser or app attempts

5/7

to access unsafe content on the web, they’ll see a warning page explaining that the content
they’re trying to access may be harmful. When a site identified by Safe Browsing as harmful
appears in Google Search results, we show a warning next to it in the results.
Threat Analysis Group will continue to identify bad actors and share relevant information with
others in the industry, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues, protecting you
and fighting bad actors to prevent future attacks.
