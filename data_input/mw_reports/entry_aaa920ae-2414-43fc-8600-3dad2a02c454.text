“RedAlert,” LILITH and 0mega leading a wave of Ransomware Campaigns
Ransomware is one of the most serious cybersecurity problems on the internet and possibly the
most potent form of cybercrime plaguing organizations today. It has quickly become one of the most
prominent and profitable types of malware for Threat Actors (TAs).
In a typical scenario, the ransomware infection starts with the TA gaining access to the target device.
Depending on the type of ransomware, it can infect the entire operating system or encrypts
individual files. The TAs will then typically demand payment from the victim for the decryption of their
files.
Multiple new ransomware groups have surfaced recently, highlighting the adoption of ransomware
attacks by TAs for monetary gains. A few of them include:

RedAlert Ransomware
1/11

RedAlert or N13V is a new ransomware strain that targets both Windows and Linux VMWare ESXi
servers on corporate networks. The ransomware stops all running virtual machines and encrypts any
file related to virtual machines, such as virtual disks. RedAlert Ransomware was named after a
string with the same name in the ransom note, but threat actors named their campaign “N13V”.
RedAlert only accepts ransom payments in Monero, which is rather atypical for ransomware groups.
RedAlert ransomware has manual operations, which means TAs execute the ransomware after a
complete takeover of the victim system. The ransomware binary provides various options to the TAs
for performing pre-encryption operations such as stopping all virtual machines running on VMware
ESXi, Asymmetric cryptography performance tests, etc.
The ransomware uses NTRUEncrypt public key encryption algorithm for encryption. The
ransomware only targets log files (.log), swap files(.vswp), virtual disks(.vmdk), snapshot files
(.vmsn) and memory files(.vmem) of VMware ESXi virtual machines. After encryption the
ransomware appends a “.crypt[Random number]” extension to the file.
The figure below shows the leak site of RedAlert ransomware.

0mega Ransomware
Another new ransomware gang, “0mega,” is suspected of targeting organizations using Double
Extortion techniques. The indicators of compromise of this ransomware strain are unavailable in the
wild.
Still, as per researchers’ comments, the ransomware appends the files with the “.0mega” extension
and creates ransom notes named “DECRYPT-FILES.txt.”
The figure below shows the 0mega Ransomware data leak site.

Lilith Ransomware
Ransomware operators now have another new tool at their disposal, named Lilith Ransomware. This
threat can affect many file types and render them completely unusable.
Lilith ransomware encrypts files on the victim’s machine and appends the extension of encrypted
files as “.lilith.” Afterward, a ransom note is created on the system to demand payment.
In this report, Cyble Research Labs conducts a deep analysis of Lilith ransomware to understand its
behavior and infection mechanism.

Technical Analysis: Lilith Ransomware
Static analysis indicates that the Lilith ransomware file is a console-based x64 architecture
executable written in C/C++, as shown below.

Upon execution, Lilith ransomware initially searches for a list of hardcoded processes in the file and
terminates its execution if any of them are running on the target’s machine. This step ensures that
these processes do not block access to the files to be encrypted.
The below figure shows the APIs used to kill the process execution by the ransomware.

Figure 4 – APIs used to Terminate Process Execution
A full list of hardcoded process names is shown in the below figure.

Figure 5 – List of

Processes for Termination
To identify the services running in the machine, the ransomware first calls “OpenSCManagerA()”
API, which establishes a connection to the service control manager that gives the TAs access to the
service control manager database.
Upon gaining access to this database, the following APIs() will be called:
OpenServiceA() – Opens the specified service.
QueryServiceStatusEx() – Gets the status of the service.
4/11

EnumDependentServiceA() – Retrieves the dependent services.
ControlService() – takes control of the service for stopping.
If the “OpenSCManagerA()” API fails to get the handle to Service Control Manager (SCM), then the
ransomware skips calling the below service-related APIs.

Figure 6 – Service-Related APIs
After that, the ransomware enumerates and gets the system drive information of the victim’s
machine by using the below APIs such as GetDriveTypeW(), FindFirstVolumeW(), and
FindNextVolumeW().

Figure 7 – System Drive Related APIs
Before initiating the encryption process, the ransomware drops the ransom note in multiple folders
with the file name “Restore_Your_Files.txt.” The ransomware creates a ransom note with the content
shown in the figure below.

Figure 8 – Malware Writes Ransom Notes
The ransomware searches for files to encrypt on the local system by enumerating the file directories
using FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW() API functions. It ignores the file extensions such as
EXE, DLL, and SYS and excludes a list of directory and file names from the encryption process
(Figure 9).
Interestingly, the exclusion list contains the filename “ecdh_pub_k.bin,” which stores the local public
key of BABUK ransomware for file decryption.

Exclusion List of Folder and File names
The malware uses cryptographic APIs such as CryptAcquireContextW() and CryptGenRandom()
from ADVAPI32.dll to encrypt victims’ files. The ransomware generates a random key with the
function “CryptGenRandom()” and then encrypts the files using an encryption routine as shown
below.

The figure below shows the WriteFile operation and the original/infected file content before and after
encryption.

Finally, the malware renames the encrypted file with the “.lilith” extension and replaces it with the
original file by using the “MoveFileExW()” API, as shown below.

The below figure shows the encrypted files by Lilith ransomware after the successful infection of a
victim’s machine.

Figure 13 – Files Encrypted by Lilith Ransomware
In the dropped ransom note, victims are given three days to negotiate the price with the TAs for the
decryption software. At the end of this deadline, the TAs threaten to begin leaking personal data if
the ransom is not paid.
The ransom note also contains the poison ID for TOX communication and the Onion URL of the leak
site page – shown in the figure below.

Conclusion
9/11

Ransomware groups continue to pose a severe threat to firms and individuals. Organizations need
to stay ahead of the techniques used by TAs besides implementing the requisite security
best practices and security controls.
Ransomware victims are at risk of losing valuable data as a result of such attacks, resulting in
financial loss and lost productivity. If the victim is unable or unwilling to pay the ransom, the TAs may
leak or sell this data online, compromising sensitive user data for businesses and individuals and
resulting in a loss of reputation for the affected organization(s).
Throughout 2021 and 2022, we have observed record levels of ransomware activity. While notable
examples of this are rebrands of existing groups, newer groups like LILITH, RedAlert, and 0mega
are also proving to be potent threats.
Cyble Research Labs continuously monitors new ransomware campaigns and will keep our readers
updated.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Safety Measures Needed to Prevent Ransomware Attacks
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
Users Should Take the Following Steps After the Ransomware Attack
Detach infected devices on the same network.
Disconnect external storage devices if connected.
Inspect system logs for suspicious events.
Impacts And Cruciality of Ransomware
Loss of Valuable data.
Loss of the organization’s reputation and integrity.
Loss of the organization’s sensitive business information.
Disruption in organization operation.
Financial loss.
