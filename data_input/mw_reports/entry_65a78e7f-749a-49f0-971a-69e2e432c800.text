Briefing Room
• Statements and Releases
The United States has long been concerned about the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC)
irresponsible and destabilizing behavior in cyberspace. Today, the United States and our
allies and partners are exposing further details of the PRC’s pattern of malicious cyber
activity and taking further action to counter it, as it poses a major threat to U.S. and allies’
economic and national security.
An unprecedented group of allies and partners – including the European Union, the
United Kingdom, and NATO – are joining the United States in exposing and criticizing
the PRC’s malicious cyber activities.
The PRC’s pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated
objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world. Today, countries around the
world are making it clear that concerns regarding the PRC’s malicious cyber activities is
bringing them together to call out those activities, promote network defense and
cybersecurity, and act to disrupt threats to our economies and national security.

Our allies and partners are a tremendous source of strength and a unique American
advantage, and our collective approach to cyber threat information sharing, defense, and
mitigation helps hold countries like China to account. Working collectively enhances and
increases information sharing, including cyber threat intelligence and network defense
information, with public and private stakeholders and expand diplomatic engagement to
strengthen our collective cyber resilience and security cooperation. Today’s announcement
builds on the progress made from the President’s first foreign trip. From the G7 and EU
commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first
time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our
allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in
cyberspace.
Today, in coordination with our allies, the Biden administration is:
Exposing the PRC’s use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber
operations globally, including for their own personal profit.
The United States is deeply concerned that the PRC has fostered an intelligence enterprise
that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide,
including for their own personal profit. As detailed in public charging documents unsealed in
October 2018 and July and September 2020, hackers with a history of working for the PRC
Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled
extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.
In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have
conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom
demands of millions of dollars. The PRC’s unwillingness to address criminal activity by
contract hackers harms governments, businesses, and critical infrastructure operators
through billions of dollars in lost intellectual property, proprietary information, ransom
payments, and mitigation efforts.
United States Department of Justice imposing costs and announcing criminal charges
against four MSS hackers.
The US Department of Justice is announcing criminal charges against four MSS hackers
addressing activities concerning a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and
entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare in a
least a dozen countries. DOJ documents outline how MSS hackers pursued the theft of
Ebola virus vaccine research and demonstrate that the PRC’s theft of intellectual property,
trade secrets, and confidential business information extends to critical public health
information. Much of the MSS activity alleged in the Department of Justice’s charges stands
in stark contrast to the PRC’s bilateral and multilateral commitments to refrain from engaging
in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.

Attributing with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with
PRC’s MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day
vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server disclosed in early March 2021.
Before Microsoft released its security updates, MSS-affiliated cyber operators exploited
these vulnerabilities to compromise tens of thousands of computers and networks worldwide
in a massive operation that resulted in significant remediation costs for its mostly private
sector victims.
We have raised our concerns about both this incident and the PRC’s broader malicious cyber
activity with senior PRC Government officials, making clear that the PRC’s actions threaten
security, confidence, and stability in cyberspace.
The Biden Administration’s response to the Microsoft Exchange incident has
strengthened the USG’s Cyber Defenses.
In the past few months, we have focused on ensuring the MSS-affiliated malicious cyber
actors were expelled from public and private sector networks and the vulnerability was
patched and mitigated to prevent the malicious cyber actors from returning or causing
additional damage.
As announced in April, the U.S. Government conducted cyber operations and
pursued proactive network defense actions to prevent systems compromised
through the Exchange Server vulnerabilities from being used for ransomware
attacks or other malicious purposes. The United States will continue to take all
appropriate steps to protect the American people from cyber threats. Following
Microsoft’s original disclosure in early March 2021, the United States Government also
identified other vulnerabilities in the Exchange Server software. Rather than
withholding them, the United States Government recognized that these vulnerabilities
could pose systemic risk and the National Security Agency notified Microsoft to ensure
patches were developed and released to the private sector. We will continue to
prioritize sharing vulnerability information with the private sector to secure the nation’s
networks and infrastructure.
The U.S. Government announced and operated under a new model for cyber
incident response by including private companies in the Cyber Unified
Coordination Group (UCG) to address the Exchange Server vulnerabilities. The
UCG is a whole-of-government coordination element stood up in response to a
significant cyber incident. We credit those companies for being willing to collaborate
with the United States Government in the face of a significant cyber incident that could
have been substantially worse without key partnership of the private sector. We will
build on this model to bolster public-private collaboration and information sharing
between the United States Government and the private sector on cybersecurity.

Today, the National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a cybersecurity
advisory to detail additional PRC state-sponsored cyber techniques used to
target U.S. and allied networks, including those used when targeting the
Exchange Server vulnerabilities. By exposing these techniques and providing
actionable guidance to mitigate them, the U.S. Government continues to empower
network defenders around the world to take action against cybersecurity threats. We
will continue to provide such advisories to ensure companies and government agencies
have actionable information to quickly defend their networks and protect their data.
The Biden Administration is working around the clock to modernize Federal networks
and improve the nation’s cybersecurity, including of critical infrastructure.
The Administration has funded five cybersecurity modernization efforts across
the Federal government to modernize network defenses to meet the threat. These
include state-of-the-art endpoint security, improving logging practices, moving to a
secure cloud environment, upgrading security operations centers, and deploying multifactor authentication and encryption technologies.
The Administration is implementing President Biden’s Executive Order to
improve the nation’s cybersecurity and protect Federal government networks.
The E.O. contains aggressive but achievable implementation milestones, and to date
we have met every milestone on time including:
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) convened a workshop
with almost 1000 participants from industry, academia, and government to obtain
input on best practices for building secure software.
NIST issued guidelines for the minimum standards that should be used by
vendors to test the security of their software. This shows how we are leveraging
federal procurement to improve the security of software not only used by the
federal government but also used by companies, state and local governments,
and individuals.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
published minimum elements for a Software Bill of Materials, as a first step to
improve transparency of software used by the American public.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) established a
framework to govern how Federal civilian agencies can securely use cloud
services.

4/5

We continue to work closely with the private sector to address cybersecurity
vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure. The Administration announced an Industrial
Control System Cybersecurity Initiative in April and launched the Electricity Subsector
Action Plan as a pilot. Under this pilot, we have already seen over 145 of 255 priority
electricity entities that service over 76 million American customers adopt ICS
cybersecurity monitoring technologies to date, and that number keeps growing. The
Electricity Subsector pilot will be followed by similar pilots for pipelines, water, and
chemical.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued Security Directive 1 to
require critical pipeline owners and operators to adhere to cybersecurity
standards. Under this directive, those owners and operators are required to report
confirmed and potential cybersecurity incidents to CISA and to designate a
Cybersecurity Coordinator, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The
directive also requires critical pipeline owners and operators to review their current
practices as well as to identify any gaps and related remediation measures to address
cyber-related risks and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. In days to
come, TSA will issue Security Directive 2 to further support the pipeline industry in
enhancing its cybersecurity and that strengthen the public-private partnership so critical
to the cybersecurity of our homeland.
By exposing the PRC’s malicious activity, we are continuing the Administration’s efforts to
inform and empower system owners and operators to act. We call on private sector
companies to follow the Federal government’s lead and take ambitious measures to
augment and align cybersecurity investments with the goal of minimizing future incidents.
