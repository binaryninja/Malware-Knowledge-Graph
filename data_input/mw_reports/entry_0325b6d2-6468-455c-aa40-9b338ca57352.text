ESET researchers have discovered a new malware campaign misusing stolen digital certificates.

We spotted this malware campaign when our systems marked several files as suspicious.
Interestingly, the flagged files were digitally signed using a valid D-Link Corporation codesigning certificate. The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link
software; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen.

Having confirmed the file’s malicious nature, we notified D-Link, who launched their own
investigation into the matter. As a result, the compromised digital certificate was revoked by DLink on July 3, 2018.

– the Plead malware, a remotely controlled backdoor, and a related password stealer
component. Recently, the JPCERT published a thorough analysis of the Plead backdoor, which,
according to Trend Micro, is used by the cyberespionage group BlackTech.

Along with the Plead samples signed with the D-Link certificate, ESET researchers have also
identified samples signed using a certificate belonging to a Taiwanese security company named
Changing Information Technology Inc.

Despite the fact that the Changing Information Technology Inc. certificate was revoked on July
​4, ​2017, the BlackTech group is still using it to sign their malicious tools.

The ability to compromise several Taiwan-based technology companies and reuse their codesigning certificates in future attacks shows that this group is highly skilled and focused on that
region.

The signed Plead malware samples are highly obfuscated with junk code, but the purpose of
the malware is similar in all samples: it downloads from a remote server or opens from the local
disk a small encrypted binary blob. This binary blob contains encrypted shellcode, which
downloads the final Plead backdoor module.

Why steal digital certificates?
Misusing digital certificates is one of the many ways cybercriminals try to mask their malicious
intentions – as the stolen certificates let malware appear like legitimate applications, the
malware has a greater chance of sneaking past security measures without raising suspicion.

Probably the most infamous malware known to have used several stolen digital certificates is
the Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010 and the malware behind the very first cyberattack to
target critical infrastructure. Stuxnet used digital certificates stolen from RealTek and one from
JMicron, two well-known technology companies based in Taiwan.

However, the tactic is not exclusive to high-profile incidents like Stuxnet, as evidenced by this
recent discovery.
