#RSAC

Show of Hands
Have you ever been directly involved in a public
white paper or blog about a threat actor?

#RSAC

Show of Hands
Do you use vendor white papers or blogs to develop better
situational awareness about threats to your organization?

#RSAC

Glossary of Terms
“APT” Groups: Groups conducting network
operations on behalf of a nation state. Includes
cyber espionage and network attack activity.
“FIN” Groups: Well organized, capable
intrusion teams that conduct intrusions for
financial gain. Seek to steal information that
can be monetized.
TTPs: “Tactics, Techniques and Procedures” – the “toolkit”
and methods threat actors use to achieve their objectives.

Research Question

How do threat groups respond
when their operations are
exposed in public reporting?

#RSAC

Bottom Line Up Front

Public exposure is a major
trigger for behavioral change

#RSAC

Why Does Exposure Matter?
Public spotlight creates a flashpoint
of awareness of a group’s ops, TTPS
Security vendors sprint to detect publicized
activity
Net defenders more likely to hunt in their
networks for evidence of a group, employ new
IOCs or detection methods

Exposure triggers public awareness and increases threat groups’ risk of
detection/discovery.

#RSAC

Why Does Exposure Matter – Big Picture

What ethical boundaries and obligations do
security researchers face?

Are we cultivating better OPSEC in the actors
we expose?
What is the best way to share?

Mission vs. Marketing

#RSAC

Key Concept

Threat Shifting
“Response from adversaries to perceived safeguards
and/or countermeasures, in which the adversaries
change some characteristic of their [operations] in
order to avoid and/or overcome those
safeguards/countermeasures”
— NIST Special Publication 800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments

#RSAC

Threat Shifting in Nature
Evolution to reduce the risk of predation

Mimickry: Heliconius butterflies mimic wing coloration patterns to signal toxicity to predators

#RSAC

Threat Shifting in Information Security

Examples of Threat Shifting
Evolution of banking Trojans from clumsy
keyloggers to highly flexible webinject offerings
Adoption of Powershell and WMI for lateral
movement and backdoor functionality

#RSAC

Four Domains for Adaptation
Threat shifting occurs across four domains:

TIMING

TARGETS

A caveat…

Our observations are based
on FireEye’s visibility.

#RSAC

Research Question

How do threat groups respond
when their operations are
exposed in public reporting?

#RSAC

They know.
Threat groups are often keenly aware of
research & reporting on their operations.

#RSAC

They know.
APT28 signals they are aware of security
researchers’ blogs (and none too pleased…)

hosting exploit to point to TrendMicro’s IP space

Careto/Mask: “…after the post was published, the
Mask operators shut everything down within

APT12 aka DNSCALC, IXESHE, CALC Team, DynCalc, Numbered Panda

• Jan. 31, 2013: New York Times exposes APT12 intrusion in their

- Exposure triggered brief pause in activity and
immediate changes in TTPs

• June 6, 2014: APT12’s RIPTIDE aka Etumbot backdoor is the
subject of a comprehensive white paper
- White paper triggered rapid shift in toolset.

Operation SMN — APT17 Interdiction
APT17 aka Axiom, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx, Voho, Group72, AuroraPanda

More than an exposure effort:
- Coalition sought to eradicate specific ‘high value’ tools and
make it more expensive for APT17 to operate
- Coordinated action was accompanied by public materials to
aid detection and educate victims

Operation SMN coalition went into the
effort with eyes wide open:
- Acknowledged from outset that APT17 was skilled, equipped
to adapt and would very likely retool

In Summary…

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the
Face of Public Exposure
Key Takeaways
Threat actors are often keenly aware of reporting on
their operations

Exposure can disrupt an actor’s operations… if the
incentives are right.
Public reporting triggers retooling
Actors may abandon tools or develop new ones.
The path of least resistance is often king.

Sometimes, actors solve the problem by adding
resources: time, money, tool development

#RSAC

Hide and Seek: How Threat Actors Respond in the
Face of Public Exposure

Exposure is a
balancing act
Security researchers must continually weigh
the benefits of public awareness against
possible disruptions to detection and loss of
visibility.
When executed well, exposure benefits
victims, network defenders and the security
community at large.

#RSAC

#RSAC

Questions to Ask

When evaluating whether exposing an adversary
is the best course of action:

When evaluating how a threat actor will likely
respond when their operations are exposed:

-

What impact do we want to have on the adversary?

-

How adaptive and capable is the group?

-

How will exposure help/hurt victims and likely future
targets?

-

How will exposure impact ‘big picture’ concerns like
law enforcement efforts?

-

How determined are they to maintain access to
specific targets?

-

Will exposure degrade our ability to detect and
respond to future activity?

-

What shifts to targeting, timing, resourcing & TTPs
is the actor likely to make?

-

Groups with a flat toolset and low adaptive
capability are more likely to be disrupted
