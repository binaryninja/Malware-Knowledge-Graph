ESET researchers document malware-distributing spam campaigns targeting people in
France

Introduction

1/19

In May 2019, ESET researchers observed a spike in ESET telemetry data regarding
malware targeting France. After further investigations, we identified malware that distributes
various types of spam. One of them is leading to a survey that redirects to a dodgy
smartphone promotion while the other is a sextortion campaign. The spam targets the users
of Orange S.A., a French ISP. We notified them before the release of this publication.
We believe the spambot is under heavy development and it has changed a lot since the first
time we saw it. A mention about this threat was posted on Twitter by AnyRun; however, to
the best of our knowledge no one has published a detailed analysis of it. We named this
new malware Varenyky, and on July 22nd, ESET researchers saw it launch its first sextortion
scam campaign.
This spambot is interesting because it can steal passwords, spy on its victims’ screen using
FFmpeg when they watch pornographic content online, and communication to the C&C
server is done through Tor, while spam is sent as regular internet traffic. This article
describes the functionality of the malware.

Distribution and targets
Distribution
Varenyky was seen for the first time early in May 2019. At this time, we unfortunately cannot
tell how it was distributed, but the more recent email phishing distribution and context
suggest that the operator has been using this technique since the beginning.
One month later, in June 2019, we saw the first malicious document that initiates the
infection of the victim’s computer, attached to an email message (Figure 1).

That email states that a bill of €491.27 is available and attached. The Microsoft Word
document filename contains the word “facture” which is a French word for “bill”. Also, when
the victim opens the document, it states that the document is protected by Microsoft Word
and “requires human verification”.

3/19

Figure 2. Malicious document

The content of the document (Figure 2) explains how to enable the “human verification”,
which, in fact, is how to enable macros. For security purposes, Word macros are not
enabled by default and need user interaction to execute.
Overall, the email text content, the document’s filename and the “protected” content of the
document emphasize to the recipients that they are dealing with a real bill and that they
should open it. The quality of the French is very good; overall, the document is convincing.

Targets

4/19

Varenyky targets the French. The macro (Figure 3) contained in the Word document has two
purposes: the first is to filter out non-French victims based on their computers’ locale and the
second is to download and execute the malware.

Figure 3. Word macro

The macro uses the function Application.LanguageSettings.LanguageID() to get the
language ID of the victim’s computer. This ID contains the country and the language set by
the user. The script checks if the value returned is 1036 in decimal (or 0x40C in
hexadecimal) and according to the Microsoft documentation this value corresponds to
France and the French language (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Language ID table

This is a good trick to fool automatic sample analyzers and to avoid drawing attention
because of the limited number of computer configurations on which this malware will be
installed.
It’s worth noting that by using this specific locale identifier, it excludes French-speaking
countries other than France such as Belgium and Canada, which have their own identifiers.
There is also an additional language check in the downloaded executable regarding the
keyboard layout. This check is done at the very beginning of the executable that is
downloaded and run by the macro (Figure 5).

5/19

Once again, a verification is done to filter out people with a keyboard layout in English or
Russian. If it matches, it displays the following message box (Figure 6) and exits.

Let’s describe the malware’s functionality once it’s running on a system it targets.

Technical analysis & functionality
Older variants of Varenyky used the UPX packer, but recent samples use a custom packer.
The custom unpacker will first XOR its payload with a 32 character-long alphanumeric string
and then decompress it using the LZNT1 algorithm, which is a variant of LZ77. The
unpacked malware is never written to disk.
If the malware has not yet been installed, it will create a directory in %APPDATA% with a
specific name. It’s an upper-case hash made of the machine’s GUID, user name, computer
name and CPU name: see Figure 7. It creates a mutex named with this same hash to avoid
two instances running at the same time.

6/19

Figure 7. Functions that gather information used to compute the hash

The malicious payload will then extract multiple libraries and the Tor executable, which are
embedded inside of itself, to the directory it just created. These libraries include zlib and
dependencies for programs compiled with MinGW. The malware’s executable is finally
copied to this directory and the original is deleted from the temporary directory where it was
downloaded via the macro.
It also makes itself persistent by adding an entry to
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run in the Windows Registry. The
mutex is released and the malware restarts itself from its directory in %AppData%.
On the second run, the malware notices that it is already installed. It will execute Tor and
fetch its external IP address using AWS’ checkip.amazonaws.com service.
It will start two threads: one that’s in charge of sending spam and another one that can
execute commands coming from its C&C server. This is where versions of the malware
differ. Some variants have more threads that are sending spam at the same time and some
have different functionalities when it comes to the commands that the C&C server can have
it execute. All communication to the C&C is done through Tor at
jg4rli4xoagvvmw47fr2bnnfu7t2epj6owrgyoee7daoh4gxvbt3bhyd.onion using the HTTP
protocol.
Early versions of the malware could receive a command to download a file and execute it.
The malware was able to handle executable files, batch files and PowerShell scripts.
Support for the last was later removed. The malware could also be instructed to update itself
with an executable that had to be downloaded from a specific URL. There is another
command that will uninstall the malware from the computer, although it doesn’t remove the
change that it made to the registry.

7/19

A new command was later added, allowing the malware to deploy NirSoft’s
WebBrowserPassView and Mail PassView tools. These are password recovery tools for web
browser and email client passwords. They are routinely abused by malware and thus
detected by ESET as potentially unsafe applications. Both are LZNT1‑compressed
executable files embedded inside the malware. They are extracted, injected into another
executable and run once to steal the victim’s passwords, which are then exfiltrated to the
C&C server.
The most recently added command will create a hidden desktop on the victim’s computer.
The malware can be directed to start various applications that have a graphical interface,
such as web browsers and the Windows Run dialog on this invisible desktop. It has the
ability to accomplish various tasks, such as navigating menus, reading text, taking
screenshots, clicking on the screen, and also minimizing, restoring and maximizing
windows.
The C&C commands are summarized in Table 1.

C&C server

HIDDEN_DESK

Creates a hidden desktop to accomplish various tasks

A feature that made an appearance and was modified in subsequent versions finally to be
removed was a function that made the malware scan the title of the open windows on the
computer. If the malware found a porn-related word in French or the word “bitcoin” in the title
of a window, it sent the window’s title to its C&C server.

Figure 8. Words that the malware looked for

8/19

This feature was later changed so that when encountering the word “sexe”, the malware
would record the computer’s screen using an FFmpeg executable that it previously would
have downloaded through the Tor network. The video was uploaded to the C&C server after
it was recorded.
These videos could have been used for convincing sexual blackmail; a practice called
sextortion. It’s unknown if these videos were recorded out of curiosity by the author(s) of the
spambot or with an intention to monetize them through sextortion. Different versions of this
malware used different strings to identify itself to the C&C server. One of them was
“Bataysk”, which is a Russian city known to have a “monument that shows a man’s hand
gripping a nubile female breast”. Another sample identified with “PH”, which probably stands
for the initials of a popular pornography website. And another version identified with the
string “Gamiani_MON”; Gamiani is a French erotic novel and “MON” probably means
“monitoring”.

C&C server home page
Over time, many changes were made to what appears to be the C&C server’s login panel.
At first (Figure 9), it displayed the VADE RETRO SATANA verse in Latin and a red-eyed
statue of Marianne, a national personification of the French Republic. On the upper-right, the
sign in German reads “Stop – State border – No entry”. The word “войти” on the button
below the keypad means “login” in Russian and Ukrainian.

It was later updated to play the song “F*ck them all” by Mylène Farmer when viewing the
web page (Figure 10).

10/19

Figure 10. C&C server login panel with song player added

In the last update that added content, seen in Figure 11, the C&C login panel displays
dancing parrots with a Serbian flag. It makes a reference to OCaml, a programming
language created by French people. Ricard is a reference to the 1963 movie The Pink
Panther. On the lower-right, it says, in French “Alcohol abuse is dangerous for your health,
drink with moderation”, which is the official warning on alcohol advertisements in France.
The picture above the warning shows a Jelen pivo pale lager from a Serbian brewery. The
song that plays is now “Opa!” by the Russian band Diskoteka Avariya.

At the time of publication of this blogpost, the login panel has been uncluttered and only the
keypad remains.

“You’ve got mail”
This spambot will send emails using the SMTP protocol through port 25 and only targets the
customers of the French ISP Orange. Each bot receives instructions from the C&C server in
order to craft an email, including the body of the message, a list of email addresses to spam
and the server to use to send the emails. The mail servers used to relay the spam don’t look
like they belong to the malicious actors; they look like servers that have not been properly
secured and they don’t require authentication.

Figure 12. Two different spam emails

12/19

Spam messages sent by this spambot are as simple as “If this message doesn’t show up
correctly, click here” or “Please follow the link: <URL>” (Figure 12). There are also emails
with attachments. These links lead to a scam, which is a survey (Figure 13) where the victim
always “wins” a promotion for a recent smartphone.

Figure 13. Survey where the victim always wins a smartphone

The link takes victims to a site where they apparently have a chance to “win” a prize such as
an iPhone X, a Galaxy S9 or S10+ for €2 or less (Figure 14). To win, they need “only” enter
their personal information; name, address, city, email and phone number. The email address
that is entered may not work if it’s not what the web page expects, but if successful, the
victims will be asked to enter their credit card information including its validation numbers.
People should avoid providing their credit card information to websites they don’t know for
deals that are too good to be true. Such deals are often a scheme to get unwitting users’
credit card information in order to charge them monthly fees, which the user can sometimes
learn about by scrutinizing the fine prints. Legitimate contests don’t charge winners a fee so
they can claim their prize.

Figure 14. Scam pages with smartphones

Although Varenyky has the ability to record a video of the display while the computer’s user
is probably viewing pornography, so far we have seen no evidence of the malware operator
leveraging such video. However, coincidentally, on July 22nd we saw Varenyky start a
sextortion scam campaign. It is important to note that this campaign is an example of the
common sextortion scam that has been widely documented and does not appear to be

13/19

related to Varenyky’s partial ability to carry out the functions of the fictitious malware
described in these scam emails. Figure 15 depicts the scam message we saw Varenyky
sending. These emails consist of three JPG images that are used to bypass text-based
spam filters.

Figure 15. Screenshot of the sextortion’s email

14/19

This email claims that the author, who is a hacker, has gained access to the victim’s
computer through a virus that was caught while visiting an adult website (the translation of
this is much like that in the English version documented here). It says that the victim has
particular tastes in pornography and that the hacker has gained remote control over the
victim’s computer. The email also says a video has been made where on one half of the
screen is a recording of the victim’s browser and the other half is a recording from the
webcam of “you having… fun”.
Furthermore, the email says a copy has been made of the victim’s contact list, pictures,
passwords, bank account data and more. It promises that the recipient of this email is not
the only victim and that the victim will be left alone once €750 are paid in bitcoin to the BTC
address 1PBpawAYJG7FfAxmTagU34CfEFoNobb1Re
The email says the victim has 72 hours to pay before the video is sent to family, colleagues,
posted on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere. It is said that changing passwords, deleting the
virus, sending the computer for repair or cleaning the computer will be useless because the
victim’s data is on a remote server (“Don’t think I’m a fool”). For proof, the victim can answer
“Yes” to the email so the video is sent to six of their most valuable contacts.
The email ends with “This offer is non-negotiable, do not waste my time and yours, think
about the consequences of your actions”.
All the email addresses that were seen being targeted are on the domains wanadoo.fr and
orange.fr; both are operated by the French ISP Orange S.A. A single bot can send as many
as 1500 emails an hour.
At the time of publication, the bitcoin address in the scam email had received four payments.
The bitcoin address has been already reported on bitcoinabuse.com for sextortion (Figure
16).

Conclusion
This spambot is not very advanced, but the context and story around it make it interesting.
We can assume from the fact that it targets France could indicate that the operator has
some French understanding, reading or speaking the language, or maybe both. However,
the Word document showed us a lack of attention in the operator’s work. In the macro, the
operator forgot to change the value of the test_debug variable, which means that the
malware will be downloaded whatever the language ID is (French or not French).
There are many functions related to possible extortion or blackmail of victims watching
pornographic content, but despite having sent unrelated sextortion scam emails, the
operator has not leveraged these as far as we can tell. Many functions have been added
16/19

and then quickly removed across many different versions in a short period of time (two
months). This shows that the operators are actively working on their botnet and are inclined
to experiment with new features that could bring a better monetization of their work.
We recommend that people be careful when they open attachments from unknown sources.
Keep system as well as security software up to date.
