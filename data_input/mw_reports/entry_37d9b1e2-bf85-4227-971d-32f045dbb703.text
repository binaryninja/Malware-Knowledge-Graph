A JavaScript and VBScript Based Empire Launcher - by Cn33liz 2017
Both Launchers run within their own embedded PowerShell Host, so we don't need
PowerShell.exe. This might be usefull when a company is blocking PowerShell.exe and/or is
using a Application Whitelisting solution, but does not block running JS/VBS files.
Empire PowerShell Host build by Cn33liz and embedded within JavaScript using
DotNetToJScript from James Forshaw https://github.com/tyranid/DotNetToJScript

1/2

Usage:
* Setup a new Listener within PowerShell Empire.
* Use the Launcher command to Generate a PowerShell launcher for this listener.
* Copy and Replace the Base64 encoded Launcher Payload within the StarFighter
JavaScript or VBScript file.
* For the JavaScript version use the following Variable:
var EncodedPayload = "<Paste Encoded Launcher Payload Here>"
* For the VBScript version use the following Variable:
Dim EncodedPayload: EncodedPayload = "<Paste Encoded Launcher Payload Here>"
* Then run: wscript.exe StarFighter.js or StarFighter.vbs on Target, or DoubleClick
the launchers within Explorer.

BlueTeam Advice
Instead of Blocking PowerShell.exe, make sure you enable PowerShell Constrained
Language to all of your users that do not need to use PowerShell for their daily work.
Use Device Guard and make sure you only allow signed Java, VBS and PowerShell
Scripts to prevent Malicious use.
