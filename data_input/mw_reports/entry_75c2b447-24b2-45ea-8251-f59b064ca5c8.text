(U) Executive Summary (cont’d)

TSA-OI Freight Rail Modal Threat Assessment

UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(U//FOUO) TSA-OI has no specific, credible intelligence to suggest violent transnational or
domestic extremist groups are planning to attack the U.S. freight rail system, or use the system
to facilitate an attack against another target. TSA-OI assesses with moderate confidencei that the
risk of an attack to the U.S. freight rail industry is low.

i

•

(U//FOUO) TSA-OI assesses with high confidence that passenger trains or stations are more likely
to be targeted than freight trains. The interdependency of the freight and passenger rail infrastructure
in the United States increases the likelihood that any threats or attacks against passenger rail could
impact freight rail as well.

•

(U//FOUO) TSA-OI judges that al-Qa’ida (AQ), its affiliates, and other terrorists motivated by violent
extremist views would be the most likely actors to target the U.S. freight rail system. This judgment is
based on recent attacks against freight rail and passenger trains overseas and the recent stated goals
of al-Qa’ida’s senior leadership to attack U.S. transportation.

•

(U//FOUO) Based upon a review of worldwide attacks on freight rail targets, TSA-OI assesses that
improvised explosive devices (IEDs) would be the most likely means of attack against the U.S. freight
rail system.

•

(U//FOUO) There is little evidence of a specific terrorist threat to freight rail Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or other Industrial Control Systems (ICS), but al-Qa’ida and other violent
extremist groups have a sustained interest in acquiring the skills to conduct cyber attacks.

TSA-OI uses a three-point scale in which “High Confidence” generally indicates TSA-OI judgments are based on high-quality information and/or the nature of the issue makes it
possible to render a solid judgment. “Moderate Confidence” generally means the information is interpreted in various ways, TSA-OI has alternative views, or the information is
credible and plausible but not corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. A “Low Confidence” judgment generally means the information is scant,
questionable, or very fragmented and it is difficult to make solid analytical inferences, or TSA-OI has significant concerns or problems with the sources.

TSA-OI Freight Rail
Modal Threat Assessment

TSA-OI Freight Rail Modal Threat Assessment

UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(U//FOUO) TSA-OI assesses the terrorism threat to the U.S. freight rail industry is low. There
has never been a confirmed attack on freight rail in the Homeland by a terrorist group, and
the Intelligence Community lacks current or specific intelligence that terrorists intend to target
domestic freight rail. Terrorist success in attacking rail systems overseas could inspire them to use similar
tactics, techniques, and procedures against freight rail in the United States.

(U) Actors
(U//FOUO) Although no terrorist organization has displayed an interest in attacking U.S. freight rail, TSAOI judges AQ or affiliates would be most likely to do so because they have stated their intent to attack
transportation modes and have successfully targeted rail in the past overseas.
(U//FOUO) Past intelligence reporting indicates terrorist groups have sought to use individuals with insider
knowledge of transportation sectors to help facilitate an attack against the United States. Industry insiders
in the freight rail business can include former and current railroad employees with extensive information
about the railroad industry and railroad operations. TSA-OI is not aware of any known instance of insiders in
the freight rail industry assisting terrorists to commit acts of terrorism; however, in September 2007, Adem
Yilmaz, reportedly a member of the Islamic Jihad Union cell targeting Germany, was arrested while employed
at the railway station of Frankfurt Airport. Yilmaz was employed in the security division of rail operator
Deutsche Bahn from 1997 until 2002. During that time, Frankfurt Airport was one of several targets that his
cell considered as a potential target.1 TSA-OI has no information that proves Yilmaz used insider knowledge
to target the airport. This group also discussed targeting other airports in Germany of which Yilmaz had no
knowledge.

(U) Targets
(U//FOUO) A review of WITS data from April 2009 through March 2010 reveals 94 attacks on rail targets
worldwide. Of those 94 attacks, only 16 appeared to specifically target freight trains; 23 attacks were
made against passenger trains; and the remaining 55 attacks were committed against other rail targets
and infrastructure—e.g., tracks, bridges, signaling equipment—that could have affected either freight or
passenger rail. The targets and motivation for these attacks remain unknown.2

UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(U//FOUO) Recent statements from al-Qa’ida’s
senior leadership regarding striking U.S. interests
including transportation could inspire attacks against
rail targets in the Homeland.3 Although al-Qa’ida
likely considers passenger trains a higher priority
target than freight trains, the interdependency of
the freight and passenger rail infrastructure in the
United States—bridges, tunnels, dispatch and control
centers, tracks, signals and switches—increases the
likelihood that threats or attacks against passenger
rail could impact freight rail as well.

(U) Toxic Inhalation Hazards (TIH)
(U//FOUO) According to the Association of American Railroads Bureau of Explosives, each year, more than
76,000 bulk rail shipments of materials poisonous by inhalation, commonly referred to as toxic inhalation
hazard (TIH), traverse nearly all major American cities and metropolitan regions. Because of its pervasiveness
(more than 30,000 shipments per year) and toxic effects (500 parts-per-million can cause health problems),
chlorine is of particular concern to the freight rail industry.

TSA-OI Freight Rail Modal Threat Assessment

UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(U//FOUO) No terrorist group has ever attacked a rail car transporting TIH commodities. Additionally, TSA-OI
has no current intelligence to indicate that al-Qa’ida or any other terrorist organization is planning to conduct
an attack on a TIH car. Nevertheless, a successful attack on a freight rail car transporting TIH through a
densely populated urban area could meet al-Qa’ida’s strategic goals of attacking targets that would generate
mass casualties, economic damage, and fear.4

(U) Tactics
(U) Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)
(U//FOUO) Worldwide, IEDs were the most common
weapon used for attacking all components of the
rail system (passenger and freight). IEDs were
used in 71 of 94 attacks, or 76 percent, of attacks
on all rail targets, including tracks, bridges, and
other components of railroad infrastructure. Of the
16 attacks on freight rail, seven were conducted
with IEDs, eight with small-arms fire, and one was
determined to be an act of sabotage. As a result
of the success of IED attacks against all railroads
overseas,5 TSA-OI assesses that terrorists would use
IEDs in similar attacks on freight rail in the Homeland.

(U) March 2010: Terrorists in the Republic of Dagestan in Russia blew up a freight train using a
homemade, pressure-activated device containing approximately 2 kilograms of trinitrotoluene (TNT)
that detonated as the train passed. The explosion set fire to the locomotive, derailed it and 14 empty
cars, and damaged 250 meters of track. There were no casualties.6

(U) February 2010: An IED detonated between two trains near a city rail station in southern Russia.
One of the trains was carrying 28 tanks of aviation fuel.7

(U) November 2009: Sixteen fuel-laden tanker cars were
destroyed when suspected insurgents triggered an IED in
Assam, India. Three hundred meters of track were also
destroyed. The blast, resulting fire, and the damaged track
disrupted the movement of trains throughout the region.8

(U)

(U) Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs)
(U//FOUO) Although terrorists worldwide have substantial
experience in using vehicle-borne VBIEDs, TSA-OI has no evidence
of a VBIED ever being used against either a freight or passenger
train.9

(U) Cyber Attacks
(U//FOUO) Although there is little evidence of a specific terrorist threat to freight rail Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or other Industrial Control Systems (ICS), intelligence reporting indicates alQa’ida and other violent extremist groups have a sustained interest in acquiring the skills to conduct cyber
attacks.10 Independent hackers, as well as foreign governments, have also been linked to repeated intrusions
into U.S. business and control system computer networks.11

TSA-OI Freight Rail Modal Threat Assessment

UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(U//FOUO) In 2003, a U.S. freight rail company’s business systems became infected with a nondirected computer worm. Much of the consequent degradation of rail operations stemmed from
mitigation efforts to contain the intrusion, highlighting how computer system performance can be
directly affected in unexpected or unanticipated ways (whether intentionally or otherwise).12

(U) Suspicious Incidents
(U//FOUO) While numerous suspicious incidents connected to the U.S. freight and passenger rail systems
have been reported each year in the United States, none has been linked to terrorism. Most involved
vandalism or tampering with rail tracks, and it was unclear whether freight or passenger rail was the actual
target. Two of the more serious incidents follow:
•

(U//FOUO) May 2009: A near collision occurred in Minot, North Dakota, when a train came upon
two empty locomotives that had been moved and left standing on the single main line. The train
crew initiated an emergency brake application and managed not to hit the locomotives. Local law
enforcement reported that two youths were observed jumping off and running away from the two
locomotives. The two locomotives were identified as switch engines that had been parked and left
unmanned on a nearby siding.13

•

(U//FOUO) March 2009: Track switches were surreptitiously reversed in separate incidents near
Tewksbury, Massachusetts, and Nashua, New Hampshire, changing the direction of rail traffic.
Additionally, at both locations, the perpetrator(s) replaced the railroad locks on the track switches with
locks for which the railroad personnel lacked keys. The perpetrators may have been attempting to
cause a collision or derailment of trains.14

(U) Outlook
(U//FOUO) TSA-OI has no specific intelligence indicating a credible or imminent threat to the U.S.
freight rail system and assesses that the overall threat to the freight rail industry from terrorism
is low. TSA-OI concludes, however, that terrorists would most likely use IEDs if they conducted attacks on
rail in the Homeland. TSA-OI assesses that reporting and resolving suspicious activity is critical in aiding law
enforcement and security officials with identifying unusual behavior, trends, patterns, and criminal acts that
could precede terrorist operations.
