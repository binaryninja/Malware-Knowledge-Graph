Sophisticated Spearphishing Campaign Targets
Government Organizations, IGOs, and NGOs
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-148a

Summary
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and
Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework, Version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for
all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are engaged in addressing a spearphishing campaign targeting
government organizations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). A sophisticated cyber threat actor leveraged a compromised end-user
account from Constant Contact, a legitimate email marketing software company, to spoof a
U.S.-based government organization and distribute links to malicious URLs.[1] CISA and FBI
have not determined that any individual accounts have been specifically targeted by this
campaign.
Note: CISA and FBI acknowledge open-source reporting attributing the activity discussed in
the report to APT29 (also known as Nobelium, The Dukes, and Cozy Bear).[2,3] However,
CISA and FBI are investigating this activity and have not attributed it to any threat actor at
this time. CISA and FBI will update this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory as new information
becomes available. Note:
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory contains information on tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) and malware associated with this campaign. For more information on the
malware, refer to Malware Analysis Report MAR-10339794-1.v1: Cobalt Strike Beacon.
CISA and FBI urge governmental and international affairs organizations and individuals
associated with such organizations to adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement
the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory.

Technical Details
Based on incident reports, malware collection, and trusted third-party reporting, CISA and
FBI are engaged in addressing a sophisticated spearphishing campaign. A cyber threat actor
leveraged a compromised end-user account from Constant Contact, a legitimate email
1/10

marketing software company, to send phishing emails to more than 7,000 accounts across
approximately 350 government organizations, IGOs, and NGOs. The threat actor sent
spoofed emails that appeared to originate from a U.S. Government organization. The emails
contained a legitimate Constant Contact link that redirected to a malicious URL [T1566.002,
T1204.001], from which a malicious ISO file was dropped onto the victim’s machine.
The ISO file contained (1) a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named Documents.dll
[T1055.001], which is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon version 4 implant, (2) a malicious
shortcut file that executes the Cobalt Strike Beacon loader [T1105], and (3) a benign decoy
PDF titled “Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections” with file name “ICAdeclass.pdf” (see figure 1). Note: The decoy file appears to be a copy of the declassified
Intelligence Community Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 13848 Section 1(a), which
is available at https://www.intelligence.gov/index.php/ic-on-the-record-database/results/1046foreign-threats-to-the-2020-us-federal-elections-intelligence-community-assessment.

Figure 1: Decoy PDF: ICA-declass.pdf
Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool used to conduct red team operations.
[4] It contains a number of tools that complement the cyber threat actor’s exploitation efforts,
such as a keystroke logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners. The
Cobalt Strike Beacon is the malicious implant that calls back to attacker-controlled
infrastructure and checks for additional commands to execute on the compromised system
[TA0011].
3/10

The configuration file for this Cobalt Strike Beacon implant contained communications
protocols, an implant watermark, and the following hardcoded command and control (C2)
domains:
dataplane.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2
cdn.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2
static.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2
worldhomeoutlet[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2

The configuration file was encoded via an XOR with the key 0x2e and a 16-bit byte swap.
For more information on the ISO file and Cobalt Strike Beacon implant, including IOCs, refer
to Malware Analysis Report MAR-10339794-1.v1: Cobalt Strike Beacon.

Mitigations
CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations.

7/10

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every account. While privileged
accounts and remote access systems are critical, it is also important to ensure full
coverage across SaaS solutions. Enabling MFA for corporate communications
platforms (as with all other accounts) provides vital defense against these types of
attacks and, in many cases, can prevent them.
Keep all software up to date. The most effective cybersecurity programs quickly update
all of their software as soon as patches are available. If your organization is unable to
update all software shortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for
CVEs that are already known to be exploited.
Implement endpoint and detection response (EDR) tools. EDR allows a high degree of
visibility into the security status of endpoints and is can be an effective tool against
threat actors.
Note: Organizations using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Microsoft 365 Defense
should refer to Microsoft: Use attack surface reduction rules to prevent malware
infection for more information on hardening the enterprise attack surface.
Implement centralized log management for host monitoring. A centralized logging
application allows technicians to look out for anomalous activity in the network
environment, such as new applications running on hosts, out-of-place communication
between devices, or unaccountable login failures on machines. It also aids in
troubleshooting applications or equipment in the event of a fault. CISA and the FBI
recommend that organizations:
Forward logs from local hosts to a centralized log management server—often
referred to as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
Ensure logs are searchable. The ability to search, analyze, and visualize
communications will help analysts diagnose issues and may lead to detection of
anomalous activity.
Correlate logs from both network and host security devices. By reviewing logs
from multiple sources, an organization can better triage an individual event and
determine its impact to the organization as a whole.
Review both centralized and local log management policies to maximize
efficiency and retain historical data. Organizations should retain critical logs for a
minimum of 30 days.
Deploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt Strike servers
and other post-exploitation tools.
Implement unauthorized execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft
Office files transmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open
Microsoft Office files transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite
applications.

8/10

Configure and maintain user and administrative accounts using a strong account
management policy.
Use administrative accounts on dedicated administration workstations.
Limit access to and use of administrative accounts.
Use strong passwords. For more information on strong passwords, refer to CISA
Tip: Choosing and Protecting Passwords and National Institute of Standards
(NIST) SP 800-63: Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle
Management.
Remove default accounts if unneeded. Change the password of default accounts
that are needed.
Disable all unused accounts.
Implement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to
discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments
and re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.
