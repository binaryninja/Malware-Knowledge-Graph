Seven years after it first appeared, the Zeus banking trojan is still active through its latest
spin-off: Panda. Panda, first discovered in early 2016 by Fox IT and later analyzed by
Proofpoint,1 spreads through phishing attacks and targets Windows operating systems (OS).
Its main attack techniques include web injects, screen shots of user activity (up to 100 per
mouse click), logging of keyboard input, Clipboard pastes (to grab passwords and paste
them into form fields), and exploits to the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) desktop sharing
system. All of these attack methods are supported by ATSEngine,2 which Ramnit, another
prolific banking trojan, also used in its 2017 holiday campaign.
Panda is primarily focused on financial services organizations, but it is expanding its
industry targets with each new campaign.
Panda was heavily focused on cryptocurrency sites in February.
Panda is currently targeting Facebook and Twitter in all three campaigns active in May.
There are different C&Cs for each campaign, three of which are connected through a
known threat actor network in Russia, the fourth is hosted in China.
We analyzed four campaigns that were active between February and May of 2018. The three
May campaigns are still active at the time of this writing. Two of the four campaigns are
acting from the same botnet version but have different targets and different command and
1/19

control (C&C) servers.
Panda is still primarily focused on targeting global financial services, but following the
worldwide cryptocurrency hype, it has expanded its targets to online cryptocurrency
exchanges and brokerage services. Social media, search, email, and adult sites are also
being targeted by Panda.

Figure 1: Panda campaign targets by industry
The campaigns that targeted Italian, US, and Canadian financial organizations were the
same ones that targeted cryptocurrency sites. The campaign that focused on Japanese
financial organizations had the broadest set of industry targets. Across all campaigns in May,
the same social media, search, email, ecommerce, and tech providers were targeted.

Figure 2: Panda industry targets by campaign
Adult sites were also targeted by Panda in May. We have been seeing an expansion of
banking trojan targets into other industries that collect payment information and other forms
of personally identifiable information (PII), so this behavior is not surprising given the size of
the adult industry and potential revenue generation for fraudsters.

February Campaign - Botnet “Onore2” Targets Italian Financial Services and
Cryptocurrency Sites Equally
The Panda configuration we analyzed from February was marked as botnet “onore2.” This
campaign leverage the same attack techniques as previously described, and it is able to
keylog popular web browsers and VNC in order to hijack user interaction session and steal
personal information.

3/19

Figure 3: Italian campaign, botnet Onore2 dynamic configuration
Figure 3: Italian campaign, botnet Onore2 dynamic configuration
The Onore2 campaign targeted two industries: financial services and cryptocurrency sites.
The majority of the targets were financial services sites in Italy at 51%, followed closely by
cryptocurrency targets used worldwide at 49%.

The cryptocurrency sites Panda focused on in February were primarily targeted through
screenshots versus the typical web inject. We assume this was to document and spy on user
interaction at cryptocurrency accounts, side by side to the web injection list. The list of
cryptocurrency sites targeted includes but is not limited to:
Anycoindirect.eu
Btcc.com
Bitstamp.net
Bethumb.com
Bitpanda
Bitbey.net
Bity.com
Blockchain.info
Cex.io
Coinbase.com
Coinsbank.com
Cryptocompare.com

Exmo.com
Gatecoin.com
Gdax.com
Hitbtc.com
Holytransaction.com
Kraken.com
Litebit.eu
Livecoin.net
Localbitcoins.com
Minergate.com
Okcoin.com
Slushpool.com
The financial services sites included in the Onore2 campaign were targeted through
webinjects and socks. They included but were not limited to:
Allianzbank.it
Bcc.it
Bnl.it
Bancacrfirenze.it
Bancagenerali.it
Bankingforyou.it
Carifvg.it
Caript.it
Cedacri.it
Credem.it
Csebo.it
Icb.mps.it
Inbank.it
Poste.it
Relaxbanking.it
Tecmarket.it
Command and Control (C&C) Servers
The C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://0a109ec2ab47[.]com/. Note the use of HTTPS
for the malware phoning home through encryption to hide its exploits from traditional
intrusion inspection controls.

Figure 5: Italian campaign C&C Whois
Figure 5: Italian campaign C&C Whois
The domain is registered through Namesilo.com to a registrant with a fake address in the
US, and an email contact at minex-coin.com. Minex-coin is also registered with
Namesilo.com, but the Whois is privacy protected. The name servers are in Russia:
samara.ens.mail.ru under a provider (ASN 47764) that comes up often in F5 Labs’ threat
research.

May Campaign - Botnet “2.6.8” Targets US Financials
The latest sample analyzed from May 1, 2018 was marked as botnet “2.6.8”. Comparing this
botnet configuration to the Onore2 campaign and the other 2.6.8 campaign targeting
Japanese financials (see next section), it has a different C&C address, and a
“keylog_process.” Instead of adding the Internet browsers, “putty.exe” was added.

7/19

Figure 6: US campaign “2.6.8” dynamic configuration
Figure 6: US campaign “2.6.8” dynamic configuration
This is not the first time Panda has targeted US-based financial organizations. This
campaign had targets in 8 industries, 76% of which were US financial organizations. This
campaign also targeted half a dozen Canadian financial organizations, followed by
cryptocurrency sites, global social media providers, search and email providers, payroll,
entertainment, and tech providers.

Panda is hitting the typical large financial targets in the US, such as:
Adp.com
Bankofamerica.com
Citi.com
Paychex.com
Wellsfargo.com
The Canadian financial organizations targeted are:
bmo.com
desjardins.com
royalbank.com
scotiabank.com

This campaign is also targeting major social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram,
as well as messaging apps like Skype, and entertainment platforms like Youtube.
Additionally, Panda is targeting Microsoft.com, bing.com, and msn.com.
C&C Server
The C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://adshiepkhach[.]top/. Note the use of HTTPS
again to hide from traditional intrusion inspection controls.
The registrant is in Russia. The domain for the email contact is bk.ru, which is owned by the
same ASN 47764 that continually comes up in our threat research.

May Campaign - Botnet “2.6.8” Also Targets Japanese Financials
This sample was also analyzed from May 1, 2018 and was also marked as botnet “2.6.8”.
Comparing the two botnet configurations, there is an interesting change: when Zeus.Panda
is targeting Japan, the authors removed the Content Security Policy (CSP) headers:
remove_csp - 1 : The CSP header is a security standard for preventing cross-site scripting
(XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks that could execute malicious code from
an otherwise trusted site.3

Figure 9: Japan campaign ”2.6.8” dynamic configuration
In parallel with the US targeted campaign, this Panda campaign is targeting the following
Japanese financial services organizations, most of which are credit card providers:
saisoncard.co.jp
idemitsucard.com
mufg.jp

aeon.co.jp
lifecard.co.jp
pocketcard.co.jp
cedyna.co.jp
eposcard.co.jp
orico.co.jp
rakuten*.co.jp
smbc-card.com
This campaign also targets the ecommerce giant Amazon; entertainment platform Youtube;
Microsoft.com, Live.com, Yahoo.com, Google.com, likely targeting email accounts; the social
media leaders Facebook and Twitter; as well as a Japanese adult site Dmm.co, and
Pornhub.

C&C Server
The C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://antrefurniture[.]top/. Again, note the use of
HTTPS to hide activity from traditional intrusion inspection controls. It’s also a .top top-level
domain (TLD) like the US campaign. Spamhaus.org says 40% of .top TLDs are used for
abusive purposes.4

12/19

The registrant is also in Russia, and the domain for the email contact is bk.ru like the US
campaign, which again is owned by ASN 47764 that continually comes up in F5 Labs’ threat
research.

QA in Production Tests

16/19

Continual maintenance is required to keep the fraud operations going and making money.
Like any business, this involves testing, and sometimes testing in production like we saw in
this campaign where the threat actors were infecting computers with different versions of the
configuration.
This testing in production was against campaign 2.6.1 and had minor changes from the
Onore2 campaign:
“onore2” botnet was configured to grab cookies and cache
“2.6.1” was marked to delete cookies and cache
Grabber pause was marked 2, which is the indication on how long panda grabber will
wait before starting the actual module.
Grabber flags:
Grab_del_cookie - 0
Grab_del_cache - 0

To make sure the injection was working correctly, the Panda authors tested against an
Australian domain. Once the URL was detected, it sent an injection JS alert “Page Injected!”

Conclusion
Panda’s expansion beyond traditional banking targets is following the trend we noticed
during the 2017 holiday season.5 This is the first campaign we have seen targeting
cryptocurrency sites, but it’s a move that makes sense, given the popularity of
cryptocurrency. This act of simultaneous campaigns targeting several regions around the
world and industries indicates these are highly active threat actors, and we expect their
efforts to continue with multiple new campaigns coming out as their current efforts are
discovered and taken down. We will continue to look for patterns by monitoring this activity
and the networks and services from which they are choosing to launch their activities. In the
meantime, we highly recommend all businesses maintain up-to-date patches on endpoints
and ensure AV controls are continuously updated so their systems don’t get infected with this
malware. To protect your business from infected consumers that cause costly fraud
investigations, monetary returns, and so on, we recommend instituting advanced web fraud
protections because this customized security control is not just for banks anymore!
