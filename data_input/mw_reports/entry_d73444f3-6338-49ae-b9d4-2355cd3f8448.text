New Spear Phishing Campaign Pretends to be EFF

Technical Analysis by Cooper Quintin

August 27, 2015

Update 01/28/16: EFF now controls the Electronicfrontierfoundation.org domain and that
URL currently redirects to this blog post. If you arrived at this page via a link in a message
that may have been phishing, please let us know and we will investigate.
Google's security team recently identified a new domain masquerading as an official EFF site as
part of a targeted malware campaign. That domain, electronicfrontierfoundation.org, is designed to
trick users into a false sense of trust and it appears to have been used in a spear phishing attack,
though it is unclear who the intended targets were. The domain was registered on August 4, 2015,
under a presumably false name, and we suspect that the attack started on the same day. At the
time of this writing the domain is still serving malware.
Electronicfrontierfoundation.org was not the only domain involved in this attack. It seems to be part
of a larger campaign, known as “Pawn Storm”. The current phase of the Pawn Storm attack
campaign started a little over a month ago, and the overall campaign was first identified in an
October 2014 report from Trend Micro (PDF). The group behind the attacks is possibly associated
with the Russian government and has been active since at least 2007.
The attack is relatively sophisticated—it uses a recently discovered Java exploit, the first known
Java zero-day in two years. The attacker sends the target a spear phishing email containing a link
to a unique URL on the malicious domain (in this case electronicfrontierfoundation.org). When
visited, the URL will redirect the user to another unique URL in the form of
http://electronicfrontierfoundation.org/url/{6_random_digits}/Go.class containing
a Java applet which exploits a vulnerable version of Java. Once the URL is used and the Java

1/9

payload is received, the URL is disabled and will no longer deliver malware (presumably to make
life harder for malware analysts). The attacker, now able to run any code on the user's machine
due to the Java exploit, downloads a second payload, which is a binary program to be executed on
the target's computer.
We were able to recover the following samples of the malicious Java code from
electronicfrontierfoundation.org.

The decompiled Java for App.class

2/9

The decompiled Java for App.class
The Go.class applet bootstraps and executes App.class, which contains the actual attack code.
The App.class payload exploits the same Java zero-day reported by Trend Micro and then
downloads a second stage binary, internally called cormac.mcr, to the user's home directory and
renames it to a randomly chosen string ending in `.exe`. Interestingly, App.class contains code to
download a *nix compatible second stage binary if necessary, implying that this attack is able to
potentially target Mac or Linux users.
Unfortunately we weren't able to retrieve the second stage binary, however this is the same path
and filename that has been used in other Pawn Storm attacks, which suggests that it is likely to be
the same payload: the malware known as Sednit. On Windows, the Sednit payload is downloaded
to the logged-in user's home directory with a randomly generated filename and executed. On
running it hooks a variety of services and downloads a DLL file. The DLL file is executed and
connects to a command and control server where it appears to verify the target and then execute a
keylogger or other modules as may be required by the attacker.
Because this attack used the same path names, Java payloads, and Java exploit that have been
used in other attacks associated with Pawn Storm, we can conclude that this attack is almost
certainly being carried out by the same group responsible for the rest of the Pawn Storm attacks.
Other security researchers have linked the Pawn Storm campaign with the original Sednit and
Sofacy targeted malware campaigns–also known as “APT 28”–citing the fact that they use the
same custom malware and have similar targets. In a 2014 paper the security company FireEye
linked the “APT 28” group behind Sednit/Sofacy with the Russian Government (PDF) based on
technical evidence, technical sophistication, and targets chosen. Drawing from these conclusions,
it seems likely that the organization behind the fake-EFF phishing attack also has ties to the
Russian government. Past attacks have targeted Russian dissidents and journalists, U.S. Defense
Contractors, NATO forces, and White House staff. We do not know who the targets were for this
particular attack, but it does not appear that it was EFF staff.

The phishing domain has been reported for abuse–though it is still active, and the vulnerability in
Java has been patched by Oracle. Of course this is an excellent reminder for everyone to be
vigilant against phishing attacks. Our SSD guide contains advice on how to improve your security,
watch for malicious emails, and avoid phishing attacks such as this one.
